The classification of these state highways fall under three primary categories: Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and Vermont routes. Routes in Vermont are abbreviated as \\"VT #\\" by VTrans and also abbreviated as \\"VT Route #\\" and \\"Route #\\" in common usage. A small number of minor state highways, typically bypassing old alignments or short connector routes, are instead assigned names and unsigned four-digit numbers beginning with 9. Most state highways are maintained by VTrans; however, portions of some routes and some entire routes are maintained by local governments, such as towns or cities, instead. These town-maintained routes are internally called \\"state-designated town highways\\" and are typically designated as \\"class 1 town highways\\". Many of Vermont's state- numbered highways retain their numbers from when they were part of the New England road marking system of the 1920s; for instance, VT 9 was part of Route 9 of the New England system. Prior to 1995, Vermont used the standard circular highway shield to sign all of its routes, which had black numerals on a white circle over a black background. In 1995, Vermont introduced a new shield for state-maintained highways‚Äîa green shield with the word \\"Vermont\\" at the top. The circular highway shield continues to be used for locally maintained routes.State Numbered Town Highway Sign Details Some state-maintained routes are still signed with the circular highway shield, but they are being converted to the newer Vermont shield as signs are replaced. Recent guide sign replacement projects along Vermont's Interstate Highways include the newer green shields to indicate Vermont state routes, as the older guide signs used the circular shield. According to Vermont's 2012 Fact Book the state spent $547 million in 2011. Less than half ($206 million) on preservation and maintenance. 28% of the roads remain in \\"very poor\\" condition. The book estimates $100 million would be required to reduce that to 25%. The VTrans report to the legislature in 2012 appeared to disagree, stating that the goal of 25% in poor condition had been met. The Burlington Free Press conducted a survey on 11% of the roads and found that signage was inadequate, often not warning drivers of dangerous curves; striping was inadequate, having been scraped off by winter snowplowing. Therefore, sides of the road could not be seen at night. Speed limit signs were placed near villages but nowhere else; guardrails were unpredictably placed. A spokesperson for VTrans agreed, citing fiscal restraints. Troopers investigating accidents are not required to record road conditions which may have contributed to an accident. Vermont Route 191 ends in Newport. Interstate Highways U.S. Highways =Mainline routes= =Special routes= Vermont routes All routes in Vermont are designated by the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans). Most are also owned and maintained by VTrans, but some are partially or wholly owned and maintained by the towns it passes through instead. Routes maintained by VTrans are classified by the agency as \\"state-maintained highways\\" and signed using Vermont's green route shields. Routes maintained by the town are classified as \\"town-maintained routes\\" and signed using the national circular highway shield. Five routes in the system have both state- and town-maintained sections. Although maintenance along these routes varies by area, VTrans considers state and town-maintained highways that bear the same signed number as one continuous route. Designations shaded in gray are no longer active. =Numbered state highways= =Ferry roads= =Named state highways= These roads are maintained by the state but are not assigned signed route numbers.Vermont Agency of Transportation Program Development Division Traffic Research Unit, 2004 (Route Log) AADTs State Highways , July 2005 The majority of them are minor connectors between two signed routes, making them similar to New York's reference routes. Unless a town is indicated in the southern or western terminus column, each highway is entirely within the town listed in the northern or eastern Terminus column.

Definitions  Although Chinese writer Lin Yutang claimed \\"Face cannot be translated or defined\\", compare these definitions: * Face is an image of self, delineated in terms of approved social attributes. * Face is the respectability and/or deference which a person can claim for themself or from others. * Face is something that is emotionally invested, and that can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction. * Face is a sense of worth that comes from knowing one's status and reflecting concern with the congruence between one's performance or appearance and one's real worth. * \\"Face\\" means \\"sociodynamic valuation\\", a lexical hyponym of words meaning \\"prestige; dignity; honor; respect; status\\". By country Face refers to a sociological concept in general linked to the dignity and prestige that a person has in terms of their social relationships. This idea with different nuances is observed in many societies and cultures such as Chinese, Arabic, Indonesian, Korean, Malaysian, Laotian, Indian, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Thai. Face has more meanings within the context of Chinese culture. = Chinese ËáâÈù¢ and Èù¢Â≠ê= In China, in particular, the concepts of mianzi, lian, and yan play an extremely important role in the fabric of society. In Chinese culture, \\"face\\" refers to two distinct concepts, although linked in Chinese social relations. One is mianzi (), and the other is lian (), which are used regularly in everyday language although not so much in the formal writings. Two influential Chinese authors explained \\"face\\". The Chinese writer Lu Xun referred to the American missionary Arthur Henderson Smith's (1894:16‚Äì18) interpretation. > The term \\"face\\" keeps cropping up in our conversation, and it seems such a > simple expression that I doubt whether many people give it much thought. > Recently, however, we have heard this word on the lips of foreigners too, > who seem to be studying it. They find it extremely hard to understand, but > believe that \\"face\\" is the key to the Chinese spirit and that grasping it > will be like grabbing a queue twenty-four years ago [when wearing a queue > was compulsory] ‚Äì everything else will follow. (1934, 1959:129) Lin Yutang considered the psychology of \\"face\\". > Interesting as the Chinese physiological face is, the psychological face > makes a still more fascinating study. It is not a face that can be washed or > shaved, but a face that can be \\"granted\\" and \\"lost\\" and \\"fought for\\" and > \\"presented as a gift\\".

(1944:61) Li«én Ëáâ \\"face; countenance; respect; reputation; prestige\\" is seen in several \\"face\\" words: * li«énsh√†ng Ëáâ‰∏ä (\\"face on/above\\") \\"one's face; honor; respect\\" * li«énmi√†n ËáâÈù¢ (\\"face face\\") \\"face; self-respect; prestige; influence\\" * li«énp√≠ ËáâÁöÆ (\\"face skin\\") \\"face; sensitivity; compassion\\" Hu (1944:51‚Äì52) contrasts m√©iy«íu li«én Ê≤íÊúâËáâ (\\"without face\\") \\"audacious; wanton; shameless\\" as \\"the most severe condemnation that can be made of a person\\" and b√πy√†o li«én ‰∏çË¶ÅËáâ (\\"don't want face\\") \\"shameless; selfishly inconsiderate\\" as \\"a serious accusation meaning that ego does not care what society thinks of his character, that he is ready to obtain benefits for himself in defiance of moral standards\\".

(1901:225) Loss of face occurs in The Times (August 3, 1929): \\"Each wishes to concede only what can be conceded without loss of 'face.\\" Save face was coined from lose face applying the semantic opposition between lose and save [tr. Chinese ‰øùÈù¢Â≠êÔºèb«éo mi√†nziÔºèguard/save face; when successful, it's called \\"‰øù‰ΩèÈù¢Â≠êÔºèb«éozhu mi√†nzi / saved/guarded face\\"]. OED defines Save 8 \\"To keep, protect or guard (a thing) from damage, loss, or destruction\\", and elaborates, > 8f. to save one's face: to avoid being disgraced or humiliated. Similarly, > to save (another's) face. Hence save-face adj. = face-saving ... Originally > used by the English community in China, with reference to the continual > devices among the Chinese to avoid incurring or inflicting disgrace. The > exact phrase appears not to occur in Chinese, but ‚Äòto lose face‚Äô (diu lien), > and ‚Äòfor the sake of his face‚Äô, are common. Among the English words of Chinese origin, lose face is an uncommon verb phrase and a unique semantic loan translation. Most Anglo-Chinese borrowings are nouns (Yuan 1981:250), with a few exceptions such as to kowtow, to Shanghai, to brainwash, and lose face. English face meaning \\"prestige; honor\\" is the only case of a Chinese semantic loan. Semantic loans extend an indigenous word's meaning in conformity with a foreign model (e.g., French realiser \\"achieve; create; construct\\" used in the sense of English realize). The vast majority of English words from Chinese are ordinary loanwords with regular phonemic adaptation (e.g., chop suey < Cantonese tsap-sui ÈõúÁ¢é \\"miscellaneous pieces\\"). A few are calques where a borrowing is blended with native elements (e.g., chopsticks < Pidgin chop \\"quick, fast\\" < Cantonese kap ÊÄ• \\"quick\\" + stick). Face meaning \\"prestige\\" is technically a \\"loan synonym\\" owing to semantic overlap between the native English meaning \\"outward semblance; effrontery\\" and the borrowed Chinese meaning \\"prestige; dignity\\". When face acquired its Chinese sense of \\"prestige; honor\\", it filled a lexical gap in the English lexicon. Chan and Kwok write, > The Chinese has supplied a specific \\"name\\" for a \\"thing\\" embodying qualities > not expressed or possibly not fully expressed, by a number of terms in > English. The aptness of the figurative extension has probably also played a > part (1985:61‚Äì62). Carr concludes, > The nearest English synonyms of the apt figurative face are prestige, honor, > respect, dignity, status, reputation, social acceptance, or good name.Ho > 1975:874‚Äì880 explains how \\"face\\" is a more basic meaning than \\"status\\", > \\"dignity\\", or \\"honor\\". \\"Prestige\\" appears to be semantically closest to > \\"face\\", however a person can be said to have face but not prestige, or vice > versa. Prestige is not necessary; one can easily live without it, but hardly > without \\"face\\".1993:87‚Äì88 = Arabic = In Arabic, the expression hafi·∫ìa mƒÅ º al-wajh (), which literally translate as save the face's water, is used to mean save face. The entire Arab culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or \\"Face\\". For Shia Islam, Face is based on the social and family ranking system found in the Treatise of Rights, Al-Risalah al- Huquq, Shia Islam's primary source for social behaviors.The Treatise of Rights, see various Chapters https://www.al-islam.org/treatise-rights-risalat- al-huquq-imam-zain-ul-abideen = Persian = In Persian, expressions like \\"Aab ro rizi\\" (ÿ¢ÿ®ÿ±Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ≤€å) literally ‚Äì losing the face's water, is used to mean save face and \\"Dou roi\\" (ÿØŸàÿ±ŸàŸä€å) (lit. two-facedness), \\"Ro seyahi \\"(nq) (lit. Black-facedness) meaning \\"ashamed and embarrassed\\" and \\"Ro sepidi\\" (ÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ŸæŸäÿØ€å) (lit. White-facedness) meaning \\"proud\\" (opposite of Ro seyahi) are used. In Iranian culture the meaning of linguistic face is much closer to the meaning of \\"Character\\". So Persian speakers use some strategies in saving the face or character of each other while they communicate. = South Slavic = Among South Slavs, especially in Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, the word obraz (Cyrillic: –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑) is used as a traditional expression for honor and the sociological concept of face. Medieval Slavic documents have shown that the word has been used with various meanings, such as form, image, character, person, symbol, face, figure, statue, idol, guise and mask. The languages also have a derived adjective bezobrazan (Cyrillic: –±–µ–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–µ–Ω) \\"without face\\", used to associate shame to a person. = Thai = The Thai word for face is ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤ [naa], meaning literally 'face'. There are basically two main ways of expressing loss of face. One, ‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤, [sia naa] translates literally as 'lose face.' Another term, ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤, or [khai naa], means sale of face ‚Äì actual connotation is that the person who lost face did so through fault of self or through the thoughtless action of another. As in China and other regions where loss of face is important, the Thai version involves sociodynamic status. = Khmer (Cambodia) = The Khmer word for face is ·ûò·ûª·ûÅ [muk], meaning literally 'face'. ·ûî·û∂·ûè·üã‚Äã·ûò·ûª·ûÅ [bat muk] translates literally as 'lose face'. ·ûë·ûª·ûÄ‚Äã·ûò·ûª·ûÅ [tuk muk] translates literally as 'save (i.e. preserve) face'. This concept is understood and treated much the same in Cambodia as elsewhere in Asia. = Korea = The concept of \\"face\\" or \\"chemyon\\" ( , ) is extremely important in Korean culture.  Academic interpretations  = Sociology = \\"Face\\" is central to sociology and sociolinguistics. Martin C. Yang analyzed eight sociological factors in losing or gaining face: the kinds of equality between the people involved, their ages, personal sensibilities, inequality in social status, social relationship, consciousness of personal prestige, presence of a witness, and the particular social value/sanction involved. The sociologist Erving Goffman introduced the concept of \\"face\\" into social theory with his (1955) article \\"On Face-work: An Analysis of Ritual Elements of Social Interaction\\" and (1967) book Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior. According to Goffman's dramaturgical perspective, face is a mask that changes depending on the audience and the variety of social interaction. People strive to maintain the face they have created in social situations. They are emotionally attached to their faces, so they feel good when their faces are maintained; loss of face results in emotional pain, so in social interactions people cooperate by using politeness strategies to maintain each other's faces. \\"Face\\" is sociologically universal. People \\"are human\\", Joseph Agassi and I. C. Jarvie (1969:140) believe, \\"because they have face to care for ‚Äì without it they lose human dignity.\\" Hu elaborates: > The point is that face is distinctively human. Anyone who does not wish to > declare his social bankruptcy must show a regard for face: he must claim for > himself, and must extend to others, some degree of compliance, respect, and > deference in order to maintain a minimum level of effective social > functioning. While it is true that the conceptualization of what constitutes > face and the rules governing face behavior vary considerably across > cultures, the concern for face is invariant. Defined at a high level of > generality, the concept of face is a universal.1976:881-2 The sociological concept of face has recently been reanalyzed through consideration of the Chinese concepts of face (mianzi and lian) which permits deeper understanding of the various dimensions of experience of face, including moral and social evaluation, and its emotional mechanisms. = Marketing = According to Hu (1944), mianzi stands for 'the kind of prestige that is emphasized...a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation', while face is 'the respect of a group for a man with a good moral reputation: the man who will fulfill his obligations regardless of the hardships involved, who under all circumstances shows himself a decent human being'. The concept seems to relate to two different meanings, from one side Chinese consumers try to increase or maintain their reputation (mianzi) in front of socially and culturally significant others (e.g. friends); on the other hand, they try to defend or save face. Mianzi is not only important to improve the consumer's reputation in front of significant others, but rather it is also associated with feelings of dignity, honor, and pride. In consumer behaviour literature, mianzi has been used to explain Chinese consumer purchasing behaviour and brand choice and considered it as a ‚Äòquality‚Äô owned by some brands. Some consumers tend to favour some brands (and their products and services) because of their capacity to enable them to 'gain' mianzi, which does not mean simply increase their reputation but also to show achievements and communicate these achievements to others in order to be more accepted in social circles, especially upper class circles. Chinese consumers tend to believe that if they buy some brands it is easier to be accepted in the social circles of powerful and wealthy people. Connections are particularly important in Chinese culture as people use social connections to achieve their goals. However, mianzi has also an emotional facet. Consumers feel proud, special, honoured, even more valuable as individuals if they can afford to buy brands that can enhance their mianzi. Therefore, some branded products and services, especially those that require conspicuous consumption (e.g. smartphones, bags, shoes), are chosen because they foster feelings of pride and vanity in the owner. A brand that enables an individual to achieve such goals in life, in branding literature, it is labelled as 'brand mianzi', which is the capacity of a brand to provide emotions and self-enhancement to its owner. Scholars have proved that brand mianzi affects consumer purchase intentions and brand equity. In summary, mianzi is a cultural concept that relates to the social, emotional and psychological dimension of consumption and has an impact on consumers‚Äô perception of their self and purchase decisions. Purchase and consumption of brands (but also other activities, like choosing a specific university), in Chinese culture, are profoundly affected by mianzi and different brands can be more or less apt to enhance or maintain mianzi, while others can cause a loss of face. = Politeness theory = Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson (1987) expanded Goffman's theory of face in their politeness theory, which differentiated between positive and negative face.Miller 2005 * Positive face is \\"the positive consistent self-image or 'personality' (crucially including the desire that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactants\\" * Negative face is \\"the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, rights to non- distraction‚Äîi.e., to freedom of action and freedom from imposition\\" In human interactions, people are often forced to threaten either an addressee's positive and/or negative face, and so there are various politeness strategies to mitigate those face-threatening acts. =Communication theory= Tae-Seop Lim and John Waite Bowers (1991) claim that face is the public image that a person claims for himself. Within this claim there are three dimensions. \\"Autonomy face\\" describes a desire to appear independent, in control, and responsible. \\"Fellowship face\\" describes a desire to seem cooperative, accepted, and loved. \\"Competence face\\" describes a desire to appear intelligent, accomplished, and capable.Miller 2005 Oetzel et al. (2000) defined \\"facework\\" as \\"the communicative strategies one uses to enact self- face and to uphold, support, or challenge another person's face\\". In terms of interpersonal communication, Facework refers to an individual's identity in a social world and how that identity is created, reinforced, diminished, and maintained in communicative interactions. = Facework = Facework represents the transition from the real self of the individual to the image he or she represents to society for the communicative or leadership purposes. This concept is all about presentation of the dignified image which soon will become as an authority for other individuals. Facework is a skill of constantly maintaining the face in order to deserve the respect and honor from it. For instance, Individualistic cultures like United States, Canada, and Germany are standing for the position of protecting the self-face of the individual while collectivist cultures such as China, South Korea, and Japan support the idea of maintaining the other-face for self-dignity and self- respect There are also exist other facework strategies not always basing on the culture strategies like face-negotiating, face-constituting, face- compensating, face-honoring, face-saving, face-threatening, face-building, face-protecting, face-depreciating, face-giving, face-restoring, and face- neutral. =Intercultural communication= Face is central to intercultural communication or cross-cultural communication. Bert Brown explains the importance of both personal and national face in international negotiations: > Among the most troublesome kinds of problems that arise in negotiation are > the intangible issues related to loss of face. In some instances, protecting > against loss of face becomes so central an issue that it swamps the > importance of the tangible issues at stake and generates intense conflicts > that can impede progress toward agreement and increase substantially the > costs of conflict resolution. (1977:275) In terms of Edward T. Hall's dichotomy between high context cultures focused upon in-groups and low context cultures focused upon individuals, face-saving is generally viewed as more important in high context cultures such as China or Japan than in low-context ones such as the United States or Germany. =Face-negotiation theory= Stella Ting-Toomey developed Face Negotiation Theory to explain cultural differences in communication and conflict resolution. Ting-Toomey defines face as > the interaction between the degree of threats or considerations one party > offers to another party, and the degree of claim for a sense of self-respect > (or demand for respect toward one's national image or cultural group) put > forth by the other party in a given situation. (1990) =Psychology= The psychology of \\"face\\" is another field of research. Wolfram Eberhard, who analyzed Chinese \\"guilt\\" and \\"sin\\" in terms of literary psychology, debunked the persistent myth that \\"face\\" is peculiar to the Chinese rather than a force in every human society. Eberhard noted > It is mainly in the writings of foreigners that we find the stress upon > shame in Chinese society; it is they who stated that the Chinese were > typically afraid of \\"losing their face\\". It is they who reported many cases > of suicide because of loss of face, or of suicide in order to punish another > person after one's death as a ghost, or to cause through suicide endless > difficulties or even punishment to the other person. But in the Chinese > literature used here, including also the short stories, I did not once find > the phrase \\"losing face\\"; and there was no clear case of suicide because of > shame alone. (1967:119‚Äì120) The Chinese University of Hong Kong social psychologist Michael Harris Bond observed that in Hong Kong, > Given the importance of having face and of being related to those who do, > there is a plethora of relationship politics in Chinese culture. Name > dropping, eagerness to associate with the rich and famous, the use of > external status symbols, sensitivity to insult, lavish gift-giving, the use > of titles, the sedulous avoidance of criticism, all abound, and require > considerable readjustment for someone used to organizing social life by > impersonal rules, frankness, and greater equality. (1991:59) =Political science= \\"Face\\" has further applications in political science. For instance, Susan Pharr (1989) stressed the importance of \\"losing face\\" in Japanese comparative politics. =Semantics= Linguists have analyzed the semantics of \\"face\\". Huang (1985, cited above) used prototype semantics to differentiate lian and mianzi. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's Metaphors We Live By (1980:37) emphasizes \\"the face for the person\\" metonymy.

The field tensor was first used after the four-dimensional tensor formulation of special relativity was introduced by Hermann Minkowski. The tensor allows related physical laws to be written very concisely. Definition The electromagnetic tensor, conventionally labelled F, is defined as the exterior derivative of the electromagnetic four-potential, A, a differential 1-form: :F \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}A. Therefore, F is a differential 2-form‚Äîthat is, an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field‚Äîon Minkowski space. In component form, :F_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu. where \\\\partial is the four-gradient and A is the four- potential. SI units for Maxwell's equations and the particle physicist's sign convention for the signature of Minkowski space , will be used throughout this article. =Relationship with the classical fields= The electric and magnetic fields can be obtained from the components of the electromagnetic tensor. The relationship is simplest in Cartesian coordinates: :E_i = c F_{0i}, where c is the speed of light, and :B_i = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\epsilon_{ijk} F^{jk}, where \\\\epsilon_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita tensor. This gives the fields in a particular reference frame; if the reference frame is changed, the components of the electromagnetic tensor will transform covariantly, and the fields in the new frame will be given by the new components. In contravariant matrix form, : F^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -E_x/c & -E_y/c & -E_z/c \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The covariant form is given by index lowering, : F_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\eta_{\\\\mu\\\\alpha}F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\eta_{\\\\beta u} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & E_x/c & E_y/c & E_z/c \\\\\\\\\\\\ -E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ -E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ -E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The Faraday tensor's Hodge dual is : { G^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\epsilon^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\delta}F_{\\\\gamma\\\\delta}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -B_x & -B_y & -B_z \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_x & 0 & E_z/c & -E_y/c \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_y & -E_z/c & 0 & E_x/c \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_z & E_y/c & -E_x/c & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} } From now on in this article, when the electric or magnetic fields are mentioned, a Cartesian coordinate system is assumed, and the electric and magnetic fields are with respect to the coordinate system's reference frame, as in the equations above. =Properties= The matrix form of the field tensor yields the following properties: =Significance= This tensor simplifies and reduces Maxwell's equations as four vector calculus equations into two tensor field equations. In electrostatics and electrodynamics, Gauss's law and Amp√®re's circuital law are respectively: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\epsilon_0},\\\\quad abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} - \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf{J} and reduce to the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation: :\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha} F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\mu_0 J^{\\\\beta}, where J^{\\\\alpha} = ( c\\\\rho, \\\\mathbf{J} ) is the four-current. In magnetostatics and magnetodynamics, Gauss's law for magnetism and Maxwell‚ÄìFaraday equation are respectively: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B} = 0,\\\\quad \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B}}{ \\\\partial t } + abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} = 0 which reduce to Bianchi identity: : \\\\partial_\\\\gamma F_{ \\\\alpha \\\\beta } + \\\\partial_\\\\alpha F_{ \\\\beta \\\\gamma } + \\\\partial_\\\\beta F_{ \\\\gamma \\\\alpha } = 0 or using the index notation with square brackets for the antisymmetric part of the tensor: : \\\\partial_{ [ \\\\alpha } F_{ \\\\beta \\\\gamma ] } = 0 Relativity The field tensor derives its name from the fact that the electromagnetic field is found to obey the tensor transformation law, this general property of physical laws being recognised after the advent of special relativity. This theory stipulated that all the laws of physics should take the same form in all coordinate systems ‚Äì this led to the introduction of tensors. The tensor formalism also leads to a mathematically simpler presentation of physical laws. The inhomogeneous Maxwell equation leads to the continuity equation: :\\\\partial_\\\\alpha J^\\\\alpha = J^\\\\alpha{}_{,\\\\alpha} = 0 implying conservation of charge. Maxwell's laws above can be generalised to curved spacetime by simply replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives: :F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta;\\\\gamma]} = 0 and F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}{}_{;\\\\alpha} = \\\\mu_0 J^{\\\\beta} where the semi-colon notation represents a covariant derivative, as opposed to a partial derivative. These equations are sometimes referred to as the curved space Maxwell equations. Again, the second equation implies charge conservation (in curved spacetime): :J^\\\\alpha{}_{;\\\\alpha} \\\\, = 0 Lagrangian formulation of classical electromagnetism Classical electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations can be derived from the action: :\\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\int \\\\left( -\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\mu_0} \\\\end{matrix} F_{\\\\mu u} F^{\\\\mu u} - J^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x \\\\, where :\\\\mathrm{d}^4 x \\\\; is over space and time. This means the Lagrangian density is :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{L} &= -\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\mu_0} F_{\\\\mu u} F^{\\\\mu u} - J^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\mu_0} \\\\left( \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial^ u A^\\\\mu \\\\right) - J^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\mu_0} \\\\left( \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u \\\\partial^ u A^\\\\mu + \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu \\\\partial^ u A^\\\\mu \\\\right) - J^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The two middle terms in the parentheses are the same, as are the two outer terms, so the Lagrangian density is :\\\\mathcal{L} = - \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu_0} \\\\left( \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u \\\\right) - J^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu. Substituting this into the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation of motion for a field: : \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial ( \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u )} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial A_ u} = 0 So the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation becomes: : \\\\- \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0} \\\\left( \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial^ u A^\\\\mu \\\\right) + J^ u = 0. \\\\, The quantity in parentheses above is just the field tensor, so this finally simplifies to : \\\\partial_\\\\mu F^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\mu_0 J^ u That equation is another way of writing the two inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations (namely, Gauss's law and Amp√®re's circuital law) using the substitutions: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{c}E^i &= -F^{0 i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\epsilon^{ijk} B_k &= -F^{ij} \\\\end{align} where i, j, k take the values 1, 2, and 3. =Hamiltonian form= The Hamiltonian density can be obtained with the usual relation, :\\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\phi^i,\\\\pi_i) = \\\\pi_i \\\\dot{\\\\phi}^i(\\\\phi^i,\\\\pi_i) - \\\\mathcal{L}. =Quantum electrodynamics and field theory= The Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics extends beyond the classical Lagrangian established in relativity to incorporate the creation and annihilation of photons (and electrons): :\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\bar\\\\psi \\\\left(i\\\\hbar c \\\\, \\\\gamma^\\\\alpha D_\\\\alpha - mc^2\\\\right) \\\\psi - \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\mu_0} F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}, where the first part in the right hand side, containing the Dirac spinor \\\\psi, represents the Dirac field. In quantum field theory it is used as the template for the gauge field strength tensor. By being employed in addition to the local interaction Lagrangian it reprises its usual role in QED.

In the , Sunnybank Hills had a population of 18,085 people.  Geography  Sunnybank Hills is about from Brisbane CBD, in Queensland, Australia. It is a large suburb, and adjoins the suburbs of Calamvale, Coopers Plains, Sunnybank, MacGregor, Algester, Acacia Ridge and Runcorn.  History  Sunnybank Hills was originally part of a much larger area known as Coopers Plains. In 1885, the railway line was extended from Yeerongpilly, and names had to be given to the railway stations built along the line. One of the stations was named after a local farm, Sunny Brae, when of land were taken over for the railway. Brae is the Scottish word for the English word bank, so the area was given boundaries and named Sunnybank. The area of Sunnybank Hills was officially defined in 1971, although it had been unofficially called this for many years. Autism Therapy & Education Centre opened on 23 July 1977. Sunnybank Hills State School No 1889 opened on 30 January 1979. The Sunnybank Hills Public Library opened in 1987 with a major refurbishment in 2009. In the , Sunnybank Hills had a population of 16,830 people. In the , Sunnybank Hills had a population of 18,085 people.  Geography  Sunnybank Hills has numerous ridges and hills, with lower wetter areas in the north and east. These form the marshes near Sunnybank and Runcorn railway stations. There are many parks and greenspaces in the area. The soil is fertile and watered by numerous small creeks, including a large one that flows north-south across the suburb, and the suburb borders on the small wildfowl habitat and wetlands of neighbouring Calamvale Creek.  Amenities  The Brisbane City Council operates a public library in Sunnybank Hills in the Sunnybank Hills Shopping Centre at the corner of Compton and Calam Roads.

The bridge is long and stands above water level. Construction of the bridge began in 1938 and it opened on July 12, 1940, as a toll bridge. The bridge cost $1.75 million to construct. It was designed by Ash-Howard- Needles & Tammen and built by the American Bridge Company, McCarthy Improvement Company, and Priester Construction Company. The original toll was $0.10, and eventually rose to $0.50 for automobiles (and as high as $2.00 for semi-trucks). Early in the bridge's history, pedestrians paid a $0.05 walker's fee; this fee ended in 1960. The tolls for motorists ended on May 2, 2003. On that day, a ceremony was held to commemorate the occasion and to honor the toll workers and all of those who had worked for the bridge during the toll era. The bridge had been under the management of Sue Nelson before going toll- free. The Dohrn Transfer Company of Rock Island, the first official toll- paying vehicle to cross the bridge in 1949, was the last official patron of the bridge. Centennial Bridge at night On September 4, 1988, 128 sodium lamps were installed on the arches, making the bridge a scenic sight at night. River Action Inc. raised funds for the lighting project through their initiative \\"Lights! River! Action!\\". On July 13, 2005, the city of Rock Island transferred ownership of the bridge to the Illinois Department of Transportation after the completion of a project costing over $11 million in structural upgrades to the bridge. It was originally going to be named the Galbraith Bridge, after Rock Island's mayor at the time, Robert Galbraith. He suggested it be named the Centennial Bridge, in commemoration of the city of Rock Island's centennial. In 2017, the bridge was officially renamed as the Master Sgt. Stanley Talbot Memorial Bridge. The five arches of the bridge are a symbol often used to represent the Quad Cities. The two largest arches symbolize Rock Island and Davenport while the smaller ones represent the other surrounding Quad-Cities (Bettendorf, Moline, and East Moline). Modern Woodmen Park in Davenport is just upriver from the bridge. On the Rock Island side, \\"The District,\\" the nightlife hub of the Quad Cities, is about one block east of the bridge.

He was the father of Sajida Talfah, Saddam's first wife, and of Adnan Khairallah, defence minister. Saddam made Khairallah Talfah mayor of Baghdad, but was forced to remove him due to Talfah's corruption. Talfah is the author of Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies.Encyclopedia of the Developing World, Volume 2. Thomas M. Leonard. Taylor & Francis, 2006. , p.793 Background Talfah was born in 1910 in the village of Al-Awja, 5 km south of Tikrit, and then part of the Baghdad Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Career Talfah, a teacher and an Arab nationalist, was a member of the al- Jawwal society and later participated as an Iraqi Army Officer in the Army revolt of 1941 led by Rasheed A'ali Al-Gaylani against the Iraqi Royal institution supported by the occupying British forces. The revolt did not achieve any major changes, with the British dispatching a taskforce which occupied the country and re-installed the ousted pro-British Regent 'Abd al- Ilah. Many Iraqi soldiers who had participated in the revolt were pardoned, largely keeping their ranks and military position. Talfah was expelled from the army and spent six years in prison for his part in the revolt. He would later play a role in the founding of the anti-British and Arab nationalist Iraqi Independence Party. He was released from prison in 1947. Following his release he returned to Tikrit, where his nephew Saddam Hussein moved back in with him and began school. Saddam had previously lived with Talfah prior to the 1941 coup and subsequent war, but had moved back in with his parents during Talfah's imprisonment. Unlike Talfah, Saddam's mother and step-father beat him and prevented him from receiving an education. He became the Governor of Baghdad in 1958, a member of the Higher Education and Scientific Research Council in 1972, and served as head of the Civil Service Board from 1973 to 1982. He became President of the Association of Veteran Warriors ÿ¨ŸÖÿπŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØŸÖÿßÿ° after the Baath party took control of power in 1968. He collected a considerable wealth using his influence as a close family member of both Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein. He formed a retail and property organisation widely known as Khairallah Talfah Society ÿ¨ŸÖÿπŸäÿ© ÿÆŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ∑ŸÑŸÅÿßÿ≠ . One of the greatest money generators was buying worthless farmland on cities outskirts where residential land was at very short supply, dividing them into thousands of residential plots, then selling them on at a high profit to people, usually government workers like military, police, teachers, and others. He headed the War Veterans Society (Veteran Warriors or more commonly called the Khairallah Talfah Society, ÿ¨ŸÖÿπŸäÿ© ÿÆŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ∑ŸÑŸÅÿßÿ≠). With the huge shortages of almost all consumer goods that became the new phenomena soon after the Baath Party took power on 17 July 1968, the Khairallah Talfah Society ÿ¨ŸÖÿπŸäÿ© ÿÆŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ∑ŸÑŸÅÿßÿ≠ was importing goods at the heavily subsidised dinar/dollar rates then making considerable profits from selling these goods on to very grateful people. When he became Mayor of Baghdad in early 1970s, he was more preoccupied by \\"morality\\" and \\"righteous behaviour\\" than other duties. He ordered the security service and police force to spray paint on legs of any woman wearing short skirts, and tearing the bell-bottom trousers worn by any male or female. These trousers were fashionable at the time. These actions against any \\"Westernised\\" contemporary trends only lasted for a few weeks and were terminated abruptly, probably when Vice President Saddam Hussein intervened. These \\"trendy\\" fashions subsequently spread all over the country and had been worn even by Talfah's own sons and daughters. Views and personal life He sympathized with the Nazi regime. He was quite outspoken and could be quite blunt and sometimes inconsiderate with people he disagreed with. He was known to have been quite opinionated, sharp of tongue, and occasionally obnoxious, though he tried to portray himself as a strict religious figure. Shortly before his death, he had his leg(s) amputated as a result of diabetes. Family His sons and daughters were known to behave like miniatures of their father. It was alleged that they could be quite unpleasant to people, expecting others to show obedience, deference and acknowledge their superiority. His daughter Ilham ÿ•ŸÑŸáÿßŸÖ (born 1955 and later died of cancer) was schooled in the famously good and strict Christian convent girls' school of Rahibat Al-Taqdomah ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿ±ÿßŸáÿ®ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖÿ©. Ilham was the sister of Sajida (Saddam's wife) and Adnan Khairallah (Defence Minister). All three were the offspring of Talfah's first wife. The daughters of President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr were in that school ÿ±ÿßŸáÿ®ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖÿ© before Ilham. Al- Bakr's daughters were known to have been very well behaved, mingling seamlessly with all others and not showing any of the superiority and arrogance that became the usual behaviour of Khairallah Talfah's daughter Ilham. It is reported that Ilham disagreed with a Kurd girl's opinion in a religious education lesson; then the secret service, sent by her father Talfah the next morning, arrested the young girl who was then reportedly released after a few days but never joined the school again. Ilham was reportedly saying that she had to get her arrested to teach her and any other person who dares to \\"behave inappropriately\\" a good lesson. Ilham married Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's son, only to divorce from him as soon as Saddam took power from Al- Bakr, allegedly through the influence of her father Talfah. Ilham then married Watban Ÿàÿ∑ÿ®ÿßŸÜ, Saddam's half brother. Khairallah Talfah's son Lou'ay ŸÑÿ§Ÿä was shot with a hand gun in 1983 while in the resort of Habbaniya. The bullet fractured his femur and an emergency surgery to fix the fracture with a plate and screws was performed in Rasheed Military Hospital in Baghdad on the same night. He made a full recovery after a few weeks' stay in Rasheed Military Hospital Officers' Fracture ward.

The legislation made Wisconsin the first state to have a standard numbering system for its highways. It was designed to connect every county seat and city with over 5000 residents. The original system numbered the roads starting at 11 and ran up to 199. The 1917 law required the creation of a distinctive state route marker, which was initially an inverted triangle. \\"...it soon became apparent that (the triangle) served no really useful purpose after the public had become educated to the idea of the numbering. The long vertical axis made it necessary to use a lot of space, much of which was useless.\\" Distinctive route markers were eventually redesigned to use a rounded rectangle for better space usage, but the inverted triangle remains transposed, as a vestige. These routes were altered significantly in 1926 when United States Numbered Highways were commissioned.

Publication history Day of Vengeance is one of four limited series leading up to DC Comics' Infinite Crisis event. It focuses on the Spectre and other magical beings of the DC Universe, especially a hastily-formed group known as the Shadowpact. The series has tie-ins to other ongoing DC Comics series, including JSA #73-75 and #77 and Blood of the Demon #6-7. It is a prelude to Infinite Crisis #1. The events of this series were preceded by the story arc teaming Superman and Captain Marvel from Action Comics #826, The Adventures of Superman #639 and Superman #216. Plot summary =The seduction of the Spectre= Jean Loring, ex-wife of Ray Palmer (the Atom) and murderer of Sue Dibny in 2004's seven-issue limited series Identity Crisis, is transformed into a new version of the villainous Eclipso by mysterious forces. Loring escapes from her Arkham Asylum cell to unknown whereabouts. Meanwhile, the Spectre, the vengeful right hand of God, is now without a host since the revival of Hal Jordan. Eclipso persuades the Spectre that magic is evil because it breaks the laws of nature set by God. This logic makes sense to the hostless Spectre, who vows to destroy all magic. =The Shadowpact= Having witnessed his attack firsthand, the Enchantress summons the Ragman to the Mist Woods to save her from the Spectre, who has just defeated and killed \\"seven hundred combat trained sorcerers\\" who were having an informal gathering. As Blackbriar Thorn provides a distraction, they retreat to the Oblivion Bar, a bar between dimensions where magically powered beings meet to trade war stories. The subject of the day at the bar is the Spectre and his attacks on magic across the world. The bartender is Jim Rook (the Nightmaster) and the bouncer is Blue Devil. When the Enchantress proclaims that the magic world needs to make a stand against the Spectre, she gets no agreement, save for Detective Chimp. Detective Chimp reveals that the Phantom Stranger, one of several \\"big-gun\\" magicians that the Ragman believes is better suited for this type of fight, has been turned into a mouse, emphasizing the importance of fighting the Spectre. These five are joined by Nightshade as the Shadowpact and they all agree to take the fight to the Spectre. While the mystics plan this attack, the ancient wizard Shazam recruits his champion Captain Marvel in a bid against the Spectre. Also notable is that the other \\"big-guns\\" mentioned by the patrons in the bar were Doctor Fate and Madame Xanadu. Both have already been disabled by the Spectre, Doctor Fate being imprisoned in the dimension within his helmet and Madame Xanadu having been blinded by the Spectre, disabling her abilities to interpret magic. =The first battle= Promotional art for Day of Vengeance #3 (August 2005) featuring the Spectre fighting Captain Marvel. Art by thumb Through the Enchantress, the group, later named the Shadowpact, learn that the Spectre was being seduced and corrupted by Eclipso. They plan what is essentially a suicide mission to find the Spectre (and Eclipso), attack Eclipso with overwhelming surprise and numbers and to kill her, hoping to free the Spectre before he turns on them. As the Enchantress, Blue Devil, Ragman and Nightmaster teleport in, they happen on Captain Marvel fighting a duel of magic vs. spirit, which gives them the time and a chance to try to defeat Eclipso while the Spectre is distracted. Hoping to give Captain Marvel more time to hold off the Spectre (which gives them more time to defeat Eclipso), the Enchantress siphons magical energy first from herself; then from mystics around the world, including heroes such as Alan Scott, Zatanna, the Phantom Stranger (still in mouse form); villains like Blackbriar Thorn; and finally, ordinary mortals with little magic power, adding to Captain Marvel's own magical power. Meanwhile, Detective Chimp and Nightshade work on a backup plan by trying to bring back Black Alice, a girl with the power to steal another's magical abilities for a short period of time, leaving her target powerless. The Shadowpact defeats Eclipso when Blue Devil skewers Eclipso with his Trident of Lucifer, while Captain Marvel gains the upper hand over the Spectre, thanks to the tens of thousands of magic users supporting him. However, the strain of gathering such immense quantities of magic drives the Enchantress temporarily insane, and she releases her link to Captain Marvel to battle her own teammates. Captain Marvel's strength fades, and he is barely defeated by the Spectre. The Spectre, who is now heavily drained, rescues a stunned Eclipso, and Eclipso uses the last of her power to fly both of them away to safety. Blue Devil knocks the Enchantress out, and the Shadowpact return to the Oblivion Bar with Captain Marvel to regroup, surprised to be alive, and amazed to have temporarily beaten back the Spectre. =The second plan= The Shadowpact, along with Black Alice, decide on their next plan of attack: they will kill the Spectre and defeat Eclipso before she can complete her war on magic by using Black Alice's ability to steal powers. The plan reaches a snag, however, when a powerless Spectre is revealed to be an empty spirit who cannot be harmed. During her brief possession of the Spectre's powers, Black Alice uses them to help Nightshade send Eclipso into a perpetual orbit around the sun, which weakens her power. Captain Marvel, meanwhile, has returned to the Rock of Eternity, where the wizard Shazam reveals that he is ready to face the Spectre. The restored Spectre travels to the Rock of Eternity to battle the wizard Shazam, changing Captain Marvel back into Billy Batson, his alter ego, to keep him out of his way. The Phantom Stranger, returning to his human form, uses his powers to allow the Shadowpact and Black Alice to watch the battle between Shazam and the Spectre from Earth. After it appears that Shazam has beaten his opponent, the Spectre revives himself, drains the wizard of his powers, and kills him. The Rock of Eternity begins to disintegrate, and travels through several dimensions as it does so, eventually appearing in the sky above Gotham City before it explodes into \\"a billion pieces\\". =Conclusion= The destruction of the Rock frees an untold number beings of evil magic back into the world, among them the \\"living\\" embodiments of the Seven Deadly Sins, who were formerly trapped in stone statues in Shazam's throne room. The scarab belonging to the original Blue Beetle, which Shazam had acquired from his successor, Ted Kord, lands in El Paso, Texas. Billy Batson, unable to remember his magic word, is seen falling from the Rock above Gotham City; the scene leads directly into Infinite Crisis #1. The Shadowpact, meanwhile, agrees to continue the fight, but will do so without Black Alice, who, as she is still a teenager, plans to return home. Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1 ‚Äî \\"The Ninth Age of Magic\\" In Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1, Zatanna leads a group of magical heroes to rebuild the Rock of Eternity, as the Shadowpact recover the Seven Deadly Sins of Man. Meanwhile above Earth, Nabu fights the Spectre. The Spectre kills Nabu; however, the severity of this action is noticed by the Presence, who then sends the Spectre into a new host, Crispus Allen, as punishment for his actions. After construction of the Rock is completed, Captain Marvel is told that he must remain in the Rock to keep it, and the forces contained within, stable. Nightshade is captured by Felix Faust on the orders of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The heroes are told by the dying Nabu that the Ninth Age of Magic has ended and that the Tenth Age will soon begin. Before entombing himself into the Rock, Captain Marvel hurls Nabu's helmet from the Rock at the suggestion of Detective Chimp, letting fate decide who will become the next Doctor Fate. Collected editions The series and other comics have been collected into a trade paperback: *Day of Vengeance (collects Day of Vengeance #1-6, Action Comics #826, The Adventures of Superman #639 and Superman #216, 224 pages, December 2005, ).Day of Vengeance details at DC The one-shot special was collected in Infinite Crisis Companion ().Infinite Crisis Companion details at DC Note on magic Note that this new definition of magic in DC titles will not be shared with the definition of magic in Vertigo, DC's sister imprint, despite previous crossovers. Grant Morrison has stated that author Michael Moorcock had written the \\"Magic Bible\\" for DC, describing how magic works and how magical characters interact. A key aspect of this new magic is to show, as with everything else, that there is a cost associated with using magic. Infinite Crisis #6 features a scene where many mystics and magic beings summon the Spectre at Stonehenge, only to have him kill Star Sapphire before disappearing. The dawning of the Tenth Age of Magic will be featured in the Shadowpact ongoing series.

The PNG government requested the Australian and New Zealand governments to provide a monitoring group to oversee the cease fire on the island. This group was made up of both civilian and defence personnel from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. Both sides of the conflict welcomed the group being on Bougainville. This support remained strong throughout the PMG's deployment. The PMG played a role in facilitating the peace process on 30 April 1998 and took over from the New Zealand Truce Monitoring Group which then departed. The Bougainville Peace Agreement decreed that all personnel should be withdrawn from the island by December 2002. However, the group's presence was extended by the applicable governments and withdrew completely by 23 August 2003. A much smaller Bougainville Transition Team (with orange T-shirts) succeeded the PMG but has now also withdrawn. Australian police and civilian advisers have subsequently served on Bougainville as part of Australian government assistance to Papua New Guinea. The PMG was unarmed and had no specific legal power (though it did have a mandate under the Lincoln Agreement). It remained definitively neutral at all times. In the early stages of its deployment, it acted primarily as a ceasefire monitoring group and spread information about developments in the peace process. Following the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the PMG focused primarily on facilitating the weapons disposal program, in co-operation with the small UN Observer Mission on Bougainville (UNOMB). There was also some logistical support given to the constitutional consultation and drafting process from 2003. Support was provided to the group via use of the Loloho wharf on the eastern side of the island by naval vessels from Australia and New Zealand as well as the Kieta airfield by RNZAF C-130 Hercules and four RNZAF Bell UH-1 Iroquois. Additional helicopters were also UH-1 Iroquois supplied by the Australian Army, which were painted bright red for visibility, were utilised to ferry personnel to inland villages inaccessible by foot or vehicle. Later, air mobility was outsourced to Hevilift, which provided two Bell 212 helicopters. PMG Personnel wore bright yellow shirts and hats so that everyone on the island was aware of their presence. A Logistics Cell at Loloho also provided such services as catering, dental, medical, vehicle transport and communications to the outer lying sites such as Tonu and Wakunui.

Jaki (J√°ki Szaniszl√≥ L√°szl√≥) (17 August 1924 in Gy≈ër, Hungary ‚Äì 7 April 2009 in Madrid, Spain) was a Hungarian-born priest of the Benedictine order. From 1975 to his death, he was Distinguished University Professor at Seton Hall University, in South Orange, New Jersey. He held doctorates in theology and in physics and was a leading contributor to the philosophy of science and the history of science, particularly to their relationship to Christianity. In 2018, Jaki was named one of five Catholic scientists \\"that shaped our understanding of the world\\" by Aleteia; the other four are: Copernicus, Gregor Mendel, Giuseppe Mercalli and Georges Lemaitre. Studies After completing undergraduate training in philosophy, theology and mathematics, Jaki did graduate work in theology and physics and gained doctorates in theology from the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome (1950) and in physics from Fordham University (1958), where he studied under the Nobel laureate Victor Hess, the co-discoverer of cosmic rays. He also did post-doctoral research in Philosophy of Science at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University and Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Research Jaki authored more than two dozen books on the relation between modern science and Christianity. He was Fremantle Lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford (1977), Hoyt Fellow at Yale University (1980) and Farmington Institute Lecturer at Oxford University (1988‚Äì1989). He was the Gifford Lecturer at Edinburgh University in 1974‚Äì1975 and 1975‚Äì1976. In 1987, he was awarded the Templeton Prize for furthering understanding of science and religion. He was among the first to claim that G√∂del's incompleteness theorem is relevant for theories of everything (TOE) in theoretical physics.Cf. Jaki's \\"A Late Awakening to G√∂del in Physics\\" G√∂del's theorem states that any theory that includes certain basic facts of number theory and is computably enumerable will be either incomplete or inconsistent. Since any 'theory of everything' must be consistent, it also must be incomplete. Death Jaki died in Madrid following a heart attack.

He has risen to fame as one of two lead guitarists in the Chicago-based jam band Umphrey's McGee. He is influenced by a wide range of styles and guitar players such as Joe Pass, Tommy Emmanuel, Chris Poland, Randy Rhoads, George Benson, David Gilmour, Frank Zappa, and Roy Buchanan among others. History Cinninger was raised in Niles, Michigan where he says his parents' extensive record collection influenced his eclectic tastes in music. Cinninger began playing in many bands by the age of 12, ranging in styles from jazz fusion to country music. After spending some time in the Berklee School of Music, he took classical guitar lessons from Gerry Zubko in Roseland, South Bend, Indiana. In 1997, he started his own band, Ali Baba's Tahini and regularly played shows alongside of another local band, Umphrey's McGee. Cinninger chose to learn his chops by playing with others rather than attend a college musical curriculum, as many of his friends did. Eventually, Ali Baba's Tahini disbanded in 2000 and Cinninger accepted an offer to join as a full-time member of Umphrey's McGee in 2000. His first show as a member of the band was on September 1, 2000. Since joining the band, he has, along with founder Brendan Bayliss, become one of the group's main songwriters. In 2001, Cinninger released a self-titled solo album released on the Monkey Fuzz Records label. Several of its tracks developed into Umphrey's McGee songs, such as \\"Blue Echo,\\" \\"Utopian Sky\\" which became \\"Utopian Fir,\\" and \\"Aster Heights\\" which contained parts of \\"Roulette\\" and \\"Last Man Swerving.\\" In 2004, five years after their initial split, Cinninger reformed Ali Baba's Tahini to record an album in the North Carolina mountains. Guitars Jake uses a G&L; Comanche, G&L; S500, G&L; ASAT, a G&L; S500 deluxe, G&L; Legacy, a Fender Stratocaster, a Babicz Identity Series Jumbo Cutaway Acoustic, and various custom Becker guitars. Jake's current touring rig consists mainly of an orange custom shop G&L; Legacy, a red G&L; commanche (used when power conditioning on stage requires noiseless pickups), and a custom made 7 string guitar. On tour these guitars are run into a custom schroeder amplification head for clean tones, and a custom OldField head for higher gain tones. He also uses an early '80s Marshall JCM 800, endorses Marshall Vintage Modern amps, OldField amps, and also uses Fuchs Audio Technology, and with Umphrey's McGee endorses Moog synthesizers, Morley effects pedals, Source Audio effect pedals and BBE Sound effects. Jake also incorporates an unusual type of tremolo arm on his G&L; guitar. The arm itself is a small piece of metal which is conformed to a specific shape. It is used as a palm rest to actuate the vibrato. This device is called the \\"Jake Blade\\" and was custom made.

Ngadjonji - Earthwatch web page. Accessed 5 November 2007. It is within the locality of Lake Eacham in the Tablelands Region local government area. Origins Lake Eacham (Yidyam) was formed over 9,130 years ago when molten magma from the Earth's mantle rose to the surface and heated the water table. The steam that resulted from the boiling water was trapped underground, until massive explosions signalled its release. Huge cracks appeared in the ground and the trees that once lathed the mountainside were levelled and burnt. Eventually, after the eruptions, groundwater filled the crater and the trees grew back, creating the tranquil lake used today by families and tourists for recreation. There are no streams that flow into or out the lake, water is only lost through soakage and evaporation and only replenished through rainfall, the level can fluctuate up to 4 metres between wet and dry seasons. The nearby Lake Barrine formed in a similar way, over 17,300 years ago. The local Ngadjon -jii (Aboriginal peoples), name the lake Wiinggina and tell a parallel, matching story of the Lakes origins, as follows > \\"Two young fellas were trying to spear that wallaby.

European history Lake Eacham guest house circa 1940 Back in 1886, Lake Eacham (Yidyam) was included within original survey plans subdividing the whole of the Lake Eacham area into farming blocks. By 1888, however, the scenic value of the lake was recognised, and both the lake plus a narrow band of 'shoreline' rainforest were formally proclaimed \\"scenic reserve\\". For almost 50 years (1888‚Äì1936) the Lake was managed, used and enjoyed as a scenic reserve, with, at times, boats and boating; a guest house; speed boats; and watersking. In 1934, the Queensland Government declared the lake and immediate surrounds be protected and managed as Lake Eacham National Park. In 1988, UNESCO declared the Wet Tropics of Queensland a World Heritage site with 14 areas protected, two of which were at Lake Barrine and at Lake Eacham. In 1994, the Queensland Government merged Lake Barrine National Park and Lake Eacham National Park to form Crater Lakes National Park. Alt URLEacham war memorial, 2006 A closed ecosystem and a near-extinction Lake Eacham (Yidyam) is isolated from any other watercourse (making it an enclosed catchment). How any fish arrived there to begin with is a mystery, but somehow, the Lake Eacham rainbowfish (Melanotaenia eachamensis) found its way into the volcanic lake. Unfortunately for the small species, other larger fish were introduced into this closed system and eventually, these larger fish ate the Lake Eacham rainbowfish into extinction - at least as far as the lake was concerned.Wet Tropics Management Authority's Story of the Lake Eacham Rainbow Fish Accessed 11 November 2007 Aquarists had been collecting the fish from the Lake Eacham National Park (illegally) and were very successful at breeding them. These private collections became the source stock to reintroduce the fish to the lake. However, the cause of the species' initial demise was still living in the lake and proceeded to deplete the entire population of reintroduced stock. Ichthyologists working in the rivers and streams of the Atherton Tableland have found the Lake Eacham rainbowfish in the Tully, Herbert and Johnstone Rivers and Dirran Creek. In addition to the rainbowfish, Lake Eacham has two native fish species: The gudgeon Mogurnda adspersa and the hardyhead Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum. Other fish in the lake are non- native human introductions. Protected area status Aerial view of Lake Eacham, looking towards the north-east. Lake Eacham (Yidyam) is the main feature of the 4.89 km¬≤ (1,210 acres) Crater Lakes National Park, with a dense rainforest and thousands of small animals. It is therefore a protected area under Queensland State legislation (Nature Conservation Act 1994), and, as such, the natural and cultural resources most closely associated with the lake are protected and managed by the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service. The lake has an average depth of 38 metres (125 ft) with a maximum depth of 65.5 metres (215 ft) and is considered by locals as being ideal for swimming, canoeing, bushwalking, and bird watching. No motor boats are allowed on the lake. It features a pontoon great for diving into the deep water. A large grassy area is set aside for recreation. There is a circuit walk around the lake that takes around 45 minutes to complete. There are also a population of turtles that can usually be seen just to the left of the pontoon.

Cedros Island (Isla de Cedros, \\"island of cedars\\" in Spanish) is an island in the Pacific Ocean belonging to the state of Baja California, Mexico. The dry and rocky island had a population of 1,350 in 2005 and has an area of which includes the area of several small nearby islands. Cedros Island is mountainous, reaching a maximum elevation of . The economy is based on commercial fishing and salt mining. Cedros has a distinctive flora and the traces of some of the earliest human beings in the New World. The ocean around the island is popular with sport fishermen. There was human presence of the island already about 11,000 years ago. The American Indian inhabitants when the island was first visited by Spanish explorers in the 16th century called it Huamalgua, the \\"Island of Fogs.\\" The Indian inhabitants have been given the name Huamalgue√±os by modern day scholars. They were relocated to the mainland of Baja California by Jesuit missionaries in 1732 and ceased to exist as an identifiable people.Des Lauriers, Mathew R. (2010), Island of Fogs, Provo: University of Utah Press, p. 13-14 Geography Cedros Island is located in Ensenada Municipality, off the west coast of the Mexican state of Baja California, from which it is separated by Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no Bay. It is northwest of Punta Eugenia in Muleg√© Municipality - the westernmost point of the state of Baja California Sur mainland. It also lies north of Isla Natividad (off Punta Eugenia, and also part of Muleg√© Municipality) from which it is separated by the Canal de Keller, and some from San Diego.DigitalGlobe et al. (2007) The island has an area of , being the fourth-largest island in Mexico (following Tibur√≥n Island, Isla √Ångel de la Guarda, and Cozumel). It has a maximum length of approximately , and a maximum width of about . Between Cedros Island and Isla Natividad runs the 28th parallel north, which defines the border between the Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. The Islas San Benito to the west, about west and in area, are administratively part of Cedros Island. The Isla de Cedros was named by early Spanish explorers who mistakenly associated the large amounts of redwood and cedar driftwood arriving with the California current for local pines visible on the crest of the island. The two main elevations are Cedros hill, located at the south-center of the island, and Pico Gill to the north. Climate Cedros Island has a desert climate, BWh in the K√∂ppen climate classification system and BWab (desert, hot summers, warm winters) in the Trewartha climate classification. Most precipitation occurs during the winter. The only weather station on the island is located on the southeastern coast. The northern and western parts of the island are several degrees cooler because the cold waters surrounding the island cause heavy fog and clouds, especially during spring and summer. The condensation from the fog permits lusher vegetation to flourish, similar to the \\"fog oases\\" (lomas) of the arid Pacific Coast of South America. Precipitation is also greater at the higher elevations of the island, reaching possible annual totals of . Rarely, heavy rains caused by unstable tropical air masses and chubascos cause flooding.Oberbauer, Thomas A. (2013), \\"Floristic Analysis of Vegetation Communities on Isla de Cedros, Baja California, Mexico,\\" https://www.academia.edu/1109025/Floristic_analysis_of_vegetation_communities_on_Isla_de_Cedros_Baja_California_Mexico, accessed 20 Jun 2018  Population and settlements  Annotated Space Shuttle photo of Cedros Island It constitutes one of the 24 subdivisions (delegaciones) of the municipio of Ensenada. The 2005 censusINEGI (2007) showed a total population of 1,350 persons. The borough \\"seat\\" is Cedros, also known as Isla Cedros or Cedros town (\\"Pueblo Cedros\\"), on the southeast coast. The town was founded by fishermen in 1922, and in 2010 the town had a population of 747 people. The local economy is dependent on fishing, and largely associated with Pescadores Nacionales de Abul√≥n, the lobster and abalone fishing cooperative based on the island. The second town is Puerto Morro Redondo (in short, El Morro), close to the southeastern point of the island, El Morro. It is a \\"company town,\\" built by the joint Mexican Government and Mitsubishi Corporation to house the workers of the salt- transshipment facility on the island. Salt from the salt evaporation ponds of Guerrero Negro on the Baja California peninsula is taken by barge to a deepwater salt dock near Puerto Morro Redondo, at the south end of Cedros Island, where it is loaded onto ships for export. There is regularly scheduled air service to the island from Ensenada, departing every Monday and Wednesday, and landing at an airstrip at the south end, adjacent to the \\"company town,\\" while a road leads to \\"Pueblo Cedros\\". Open launch rides across the channel between Cedros and the mainland can also be arranged at the Abarrotes Ramales store in Bahia Tortugas, but travellers opting for this transport should be prepared to have a flexible schedule with several extra days in case of inclement weather conditions in the Channel. The remaining settlements are smaller. Jerusalem is just west of El Morro, but on the western side of the airport, with regularly arranged residential units. It is frequently considered part of El Morro. Lomas Blancas, a mining town with 17 buildings, is located between Cedros town and El Morro. San Agust√≠n, a typical fishing village with about 20 buildings, is located northeast of the southwestern point of the island, Cabo San Agust√≠n. La Colorada, on the southwest coast, with about 10 buildings, is north of San Agust√≠n. Wayle, 15 buildings on the western side of the southern bight Bah√≠a del Sur, is northeast of San Agust√≠n. The mining town of Punta Norte (about 25 buildings) is located on the northeast coast, southeast of the northern end of the island, which is also called Punta Norte. to the southeast is Los Crestones mine.

Auckland Museum Mother of pearl fish hook. Collected from the Society Islands during Captain Cook's voyages to the Pacific, 1768-1780 Australian Museum The long-held theory that the first human beings in the Americas arrived by land through an ice-free corridor in western Canada has been called into question by archaeological discoveries along the Pacific coastlines of North and South America. Many scientists now believe that the earliest inhabitants arrived by boat, and findings on Cedros Island bolster that theory. The Clovis culture, which began about 11,200 BCE, is the earliest universally acknowledged evidence of man in the Americas; but the remains of ancient people dating to earlier than 10,000 BCE have been found on Cedros Island. Cedros Island was attractive to humans because of its rich marine environment and its relative abundance of water compared to most of the desert coastline of Baja California. The early people of Cedros Island fished, gathered shellfish, and hunted seals, sea lions, and seabirds. Ancient spear points and shell fishhooks found on Cedros are similar to those found in a semi-circle of the Pacific coastline from Okinawa to Peru.Des Lauriers, Matthew R.

They date to about 11,000 B.P. The people making these fishhooks were fishing for deepwater species, which indicates that they were using boats. Similar fishhooks have also been reported from Isla Esp√≠ritu Santo, also in Baja California. History ; Spanish colonial period In 1539, when the Spanish expedition led by Francisco de Ulloa landed on the island, it encountered several villages with populations at each estimated in the hundreds. Finding it difficult to reach the remaining Indians on the island, the Jesuit missionaries practiced Indian reductions and brought them all to Misi√≥n San Ignacio Kadakaam√°n, in San Ignacio on the Baja California mainland in 1732. Hunters seeking seals and sea otters worked out the island between 1790 and 1850. ;20th century Gold and copper mining took place near Punta Norte between 1890 and 1917. The fishing village and cannery at Puerto Cedros were established in 1920. The fishing cooperative was founded in 1943, and the deepwater salt dock at the south end of the island was built in 1966. The island was mapped in detail by Mexican and U.S. geologists during the 1970s.  Natural history  Cedros Island is at most some long in N-S direction and wide in the northern half; the southern end is some wide in a NW-SE direction.DigitalGlobe et al. (2007). The measurements in Thayer & Bangs (1907) are in nautical miles. The island consists of a variety of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, including part of an ophiolite complex and high-pressure, low temperature blueschists. Most of the rocks are of Mesozoic age, though some late Cenozoic strata crop out near the town in the southeastern corner of the island. Its highest peak, Monte Cedros, has an elevation of . =Flora= The most common vegetation for more than 90 percent of the land on the island is desert scrub of many different species. The lower elevations, especially the south, receive very sparse rainfall. However, the northern and western parts of the island are often shrouded in fog, and some plants have adapted to receiving moisture from fog. The fog plus the slightly greater rainfall at higher elevations has permitted the existence of Monterey pine forests at elevations of to where the influence of the fog is most intense. The pine forests are scattered and only cover 0.46 percent of the total area of the island. The pines grow to a height of up to . California juniper are also found at similar altitudes, covering 0.05 percent of the land area.Oberbauer, pp. 118-120 At the highest elevations of the island, above and mixed in with the pine forests, chaparral vegetation is found. The chaparral averages in height and consists of several woody species including Quercus cedrosensis, the Cedar Island live oak. Chaparral covers 2.4 percent of the land area of Cedar Island.Oberbauer, pp. 118-119 Vargas or El Aguaje de Vargas is the most important spring with a flow of 180 drums of 200 lts or 55 US gal (208 l; 46 imp gal) every 12 hours; springs on the island are usually marked by groves of palm trees. =Fauna= Large sea lion colonies are found on the rocks on the west side as well as the anchorage on the north end. There are feral goats on Cedros. Unlike on other islands in the region (notably Guadalupe Island), they do not seem to have had a significant impact on the island ecosystem. This would be due to the fact that Cedros is on the continental shelf close to the coast and, at least temporarily, it was connected to the mainland during the last ice age when sea levels were lower than today. Then, and as a consequence of this, there are native Cedros herbivores, such as Cedros Island mule deer which on one hand compete with the goat population for food and presumably have kept it from increasing beyond carrying capacity, and on the other hand forced the native plants to keep their defenses against herbivores, unlike plants on islands without megaherbivores which tend to lack those defenses. Fish are abundant around Cedros Island. California yellowtail, a subspecies of yellowtail amberjack, are very plentiful at this island because of yellowtail breed there. These fish like to live in the kelp beds of the island. Other fish, such as calico bass and sheepshead are also very plentiful on the island. = Endemism = Cedros Island is home to a number of taxa that are endemic to or occur in very few places outside the island.

The lake and surrounds are protected within the Crater Lakes National Park and are accessible via the Gillies Highway. Origin Lake Barrine was formed over 17,000 years ago when a large volcano erupted, leaving a crater that over time filled up with water to create a lake. The crater or maar was formed as a result of a series of volcanic explosions. These explosions were caused by the hot molten rock coming into contact with groundwater. This caused a build-up of steam, gases and pressure which blasted the central core from the volcano. This massive explosion left a huge crater, which filled with rainwater to create Lake Barrine. Local Aboriginals called the lake Barany. Description Viewed from the forest trail that encircles the lake The largest of the natural volcanic lakes in the area, Lake Barrine is 730 m above sea level. It is about 1 km in diameter, with a shoreline of almost 4.5 km, an average depth of 35 m and a maximum depth of 65 m. No streams or springs feed the crystal clear lake; it is filled only by rainwater. During the wet season a small creek flows out of the lake. It joins Toohey Creek which is a tributary of the Mulgrave River. Facilities There are walking tracks around the lake and tour operators offer cruises on the lake.About Lake Barrine.

It is an Aboriginal community about by road from Cairns CBD on Cape Grafton. It is much closer by direct-line distance but is separated from Cairns CBD by the Murray Prior Range and Trinity Inlet, an inlet of the Coral Sea. At the , Yarrabah had a population of 2,559.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. History Gunggay (also known as Gunggandji, Kongandji, Kongkandji, Gungganyji, Idindji and Yidiny) is an Aboriginal language of Far North Queensland. The Gunggay language region of Cape Grafton includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cairns Regional Council and Yarrabah Community Council. An Anglican church missionary, Ernest Gribble (1868‚Äì1957) in 1892 began to regularly visit an Aboriginal group who inhabited the Yarrabah area living a very traditional lifestyle. These visits by Gribble were to encourage the tribe to move to a mission settlement he was setting up. With the help of the tribe's leader, Menmuny, the tribe moved to the mission now known as Yarrabah Community. The mission was settled in 1893. Over time, many people (including some South Sea Islanders) were relocated from homelands in the surrounding area to Yarrabah. Yarrabah State School was opened on 1 January 1892. In 2017, Yarrabah State School celebrated its 125th anniversary. In 1957, the Yarrabah residents staged a strike to protest poor working conditions, inadequate food, health problems and harsh administration. The church expelled the ringleaders and many others left voluntarily, never to return. A few years later, the Government of Queensland assumed control of the mission. As a result, still today most of Yarrabah is Crown Land. Native Title claims here are hard to put forward, due to the very fragmented ethnic composition of this community, with many Aboriginal people in Yarrabah having been settled here from other areas, including interstate. In 1965, an advisory council was set up which allowed Aboriginal people to give \\"advice\\" to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but it had no actual power and the government continued to control all aspects of local people's lives. In 1979, several community members joined a union but were stood down. Eventually, on 27 October 1986, the community received Deed of Grant in Trust land tenure, making it subject to the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984, which allowed for self-governing Aboriginal Community Councils with a range of powers and controls over the land. With the passage of reforms in 2005, the Council became an \\"Aboriginal Shire\\" and gained the authority of a legal local government. Following the 2001 Cape York Justice Study findings, Yarrabah became one of many indigenous communities in Queensland to be subject to an alcohol management plan. Restrictions on alcohol possession commenced on 6 February 2004, with a review by 2006. A 2012 survey for another review showed the community was divided on easing restrictions. On 23 July 2007, Yarrabah hosted the Cabinet of the Queensland Government in the first ever Cabinet meeting to be held in an indigenous Australian community.Queensland Cabinet Meets in far north, news.com.au; On 1 October 2007, the Howard Coalition Government chose Yarrabah as the first recipient of what was said to be a 'landmark housing and welfare reform agreement'.Yarrabah, Govt to sign welfare deal news.com.au website. Retrieved 2 October 2007. In 2009 as part of the Local Government Reform Agenda in Queensland, the Council gained recognition as a local government council.https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-017 Demographics The population of community was given to be about 630 indigenous persons in 1952. According to the 2016 Census the town had a population of 2,559 people. However, note that official estimates of population may be undercounts due to both language barriers and the transient nature of residence of the outstations. Of those, 97.4% identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The median age of Yarrabah residents was 23, compared with 38 nationally. The majority of the Yarrabah workforce was engaged as either labourers or as community and personal service workers, and worked in local government administration or social assistance services. The median individual income was $224 per week compared with $534 per week for the Cairns statistical district. 84.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kriol at 6.7%. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 84.6% and No Religion 7.4%.Yarrabah, from Back Beach Road, looking towards 'the mission', a reference to the main settlement. Education The Yarrabah community has a state pre-school, primary school and high school, which extends to Year 10 only. The nearest school for students continuing on to senior years (Year 11‚Äì12) is located in Gordonvale. Pupils who attend the Gordonvale High School commute to and from it with a free-of-charge school bus, which is the only public transport available for Yarrabah residents. A few decades back a ferry service used to take pupils to and from school in Cairns, before the road to Yarrabah was sealed. This service is no longer in use. The Yarrabah community has a public library which serves a number of purposes including access to computers and the Internet, equipment to watch movies on DVD, and educational links including a Homework Centre (a Federal Government initiative) and access to the RATEP (Aboriginal Teacher Education Program) at James Cook University in Townsville for those training to be teachers. The Yarrabah community has its own newsletter entitled Yarrabah News, published monthly since the late 1970s. Facilities Yarrabah has one small supermarket run by local people, two hot food take-away shops, a local bakery and a drive-in pub, as well as a service station. For most other commercial needs, people need to travel to Gordonvale, Edmonton or Cairns. The road to the community is bitumen sealed and is accessible all year round despite weather conditions. Ergon Energy powers the station and the residences. Ergon Energy power lines power the whole community as far as the Oombunji suburb (5-10 kilometres from the Community). Residents who live further than Oombunji and other places/suburbs in Yarrabah such as Wungu ('sounds of corroboree dance'), Back Beach, Buddabaddoo, King Beach, Turtle Bay and Jilji have to use power generators for electricity. People who live in these outer places/suburbs can also adapt to live without power. The area is subjected to power blackouts especially during the wet season. During the blackouts there are no cooking facilities. Some blackouts have been known to last up to five days. Yarrabah's medical needs are serviced by a multi- disciplinary primary health care centre, which handles emergencies and general practice care, but does not have inpatient facilities. It is staffed 24 hours a day by staff who mostly commute from Cairns. A police station and a police citizens youth club are also within the township. Issues of concern include violence, alcohol/substance abuse, domestic violence, and high unemployment. Previously youth suicide was higher than surrounding areas. The township has had a brass band since 1901 to the 1950s, until resurrected in 2013,2015 'Chris Tamwoy to play Yarrabah Festival', Torres News (Thursday Island, Qld. : 1957-2015), 2 November, p. 7. , viewed 10 May 2020, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article255548448 making their debut at the inaugural Yarrabah Band Festival. The festival itself is now held annually around October, drawing a crowd of about 4000 persons. Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre library service located at Lot 207 Noble Drive which opened in 2015. The $1.9 million facility was built both for and by the people of Yarrabah, offering learning opportunities even during its construction. Funding for the Centre was secured in 2012 by Treasurer and Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships Curtis Pitt, who officially opened the Yarrabah Knowledge Centre on 19 November. Leeanne Enoch, Minister for Science and Innovation, was also in attendance. The Yarrabah Menmuny Museum, opened in 1996, is located in the Jilji suburb. The museum's name comes the local tribe leader of the late 1800s, Menmuny, who was also given the title 'King John' Menmuny, who died circa 1919. A later elder was 'King' Albert Maywee. Transport Yarrabah used to be serviced by the Paradise Bus, which is based in Babinda and privately run. As of 2016 this bus service only provides a regular service along the Bruce Highway, about 30 km from Yarrabah, which joins the community of Gordonvale (south of Cairns), with the suburb of Edmonton and the Cairns CBD. A ferry service used to be in place at Yarrabah, back in the days when there were no sealed roads to reach Cairns. Locals used to call this ferry a 'flatty'. It used to carry school children back and forth from Yarrabah to the city of Cairns. A project to build a new wharf at Yarrabah is in place, after the Queensland Government allocated 7 million dollars to this purpose. It is expected when this new wharf becomes operational, regular and reliable water transport will be resumed for Yarrabah, which lies only 11 kilometres by sea from the Cairns waterfront. Youth can be occasionally riding some of the brumbies of the area, without saddles.

The Figge, as it is commonly known, has an encyclopedic collection and serves as the major art museum for the eastern Iowa and western Illinois region. The Figge works closely with several regional universities and colleges (see below) as an art resource and collections hub for a number of higher education programs. The museum opened on August 6, 2005, and is the renamed successor to the Davenport Museum of Art, which was opened on October 10, 1928, as the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery. The museum has its roots in the Davenport Art Association, which was founded before February 23, 1878, and was re-located on November 15, 1889, to the Bianca Wheeler art studio. The Figge Art Museum is one of the oldest art institutions in the country and is considered the first municipal art gallery in the United States. The Figge won an AIA award. The new building was designed by Stirling Prize-winning Modernist British architect David Chipperfield. It was Chipperfield's first architectural commission in the United States. The Figge Art Museum gets its name from the V.O. and Elizabeth Kahl Figge Foundation, which donated $13 million towards its $47 million construction. The Figge family, a local banking family of Swiss origin, has a long tradition of philanthropy and cultural enrichment. The first pieces of its collections were donated by Davenport community leader Charles Ficke (1850‚Äì1931), a successful lawyer and former mayor, who collected art from around the world. Robert E. Harsche, then Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, reported that to his knowledge no American public art gallery had \\"started out with so large a number of important paintings as a nucleus.\\" Figge art collection The museum has over 4,000 works of art, ranging from the 16th century to the present, and is best known for its extensive collection of Haitian, Colonial Mexican and Midwestern art, particularly pieces by Thomas Hart Benton, Marvin Cone and Grant Wood, including the only self-portrait Wood ever painted. In 1990, Grant Wood's estate, which included his personal effects and various works of art, became the property of the Figge Art Museum through his sister Nan Wood Graham, the woman portrayed in American Gothic. The institution also houses a substantial American collection (including works by Albert Bierstadt, James McNeill Whistler, William Merritt Chase, Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, Ansel Adams, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns), European art (including work by artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Henry Raeburn, Toulouse- Lautrec and Pierre-Auguste Renoir), and works from East Asia (with pieces by Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kunisada). As owners of Grant Wood's estate, the museum is also home to the Grant Wood Archives, and received substantial support from The Henry Luce Foundation for the conservation of these archives. The museum exhibits an important collection of pieces by Frank Lloyd Wright, the American architect and designer from the Midwest. Its inaugural exhibition, \\"The Great American Thing: 1915-1935\\" opened September 17, 2005, and featured major works from early American Modernists.  University of Iowa art collection  The Figge Art Museum currently houses the University of Iowa Museum of Art collection, after the University of Iowa's gallery was flooded in 2008. The collection, which totals over 12,000 works, includes significant paintings by American artists such as Jackson Pollock, Stuart Davis, Richard Diebenkorn, Peter Golfinopoulos, Sam Gilliam, Adolph Gottlieb, Joan Mitchell, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt, and Marsden Hartley, as well as European artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Max Beckmann, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Giorgio de Chirico, Lyonel Feininger, Juan Gris, Alexej von Jawlensky, Fernand L√©ger, Joan Mir√≥, Giorgio Morandi, and Chaim Soutine. The collection also contains significant pieces from sub-Saharan Africa, Pre-Columbian art, a significant collection of European and American prints and drawings, as well as many other areas of the world.  Western Illinois University graduate program in Museum Studies  The Figge Art Museum is home to Western Illinois University's graduate program in Museum Studies, which offers a Master of Arts degree in the various aspects of museum management, such as curatorial design, museum administration and finance, art education, collections management, and marketing/PR.  Other information  The museum is 115,000 square feet (10,683 m¬≤) and has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums since 1973.

It was founded by Guy de Montpellier in Provence for the care of the sick by groups of lay people. Pope Innocent III recognised it ca 1161-June 16, 1216. It was originally based in the Santo Spirito in Sassia in Rome. A small female remnant survives in Poland.  History  The order was responsible for running hospitals - known as Hospitals of the Holy Ghost - throughout Europe for centuries. At its prime, they numbered many hundreds. The wealth of its endowments made it a repeated target for the unscrupulous. The lay Knights of the Holy Ghost formed on analogy to military orders, but without military function, repeatedly attempted to divert the group's assets to their own use. Several popes made efforts to protect the order as a purely religious body, but Pope Pius V in 1619 re-created the Knights and again diverted the Order's assets into their hands. In 1692 Louis XIV redirected the property in the possession of the Knights for the benefit of his own Order of Our Lady of Carmel, in effect a pension fund for his retired soldiers. The remaining religious members of the order were successful in obtaining an edict in 1700 which again confirmed the purely religious nature of the order and regaining the use of the funds for religious and charitable purposes.Orders of the Holy Ghost - Catholic Encyclopedia article These now focused on a single institution, the original and by this time large Arcispedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia, the buildings of which dated from the time of Pope Sixtus IV (1471‚Äì84), which at its height was capable of accommodating over 1,000 patients, with additional spaces for contagious and for dangerously insane cases, employing more than 100 medical staff with an international remit. Over time it became a municipal hospital for the inhabitants of Rome and later became a museum and conference center. The Order in Rome gradually merged into the medical profession, though offshoots of the order survived into the 20th century in France. The order was abolished in 1783.

Campus history Albany High School's new building In 1997, Albany High School's main building and gymnasium, both completed in 1934, were deemed to be seismically unsound. They were demolished, and construction began on a new campus. During the four years of construction, between 1997 and 2001, classes were held in portable trailers. The new school building and gymnasium opened in 2001. During the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, several security cameras were installed in the building to prevent vandalism. In 2004, the school suffered overcrowding due to an overly large freshman class. The large influx of students was caused in part by an Albany Unified School District policy, which allowed students from other cities such as El Cerrito and Richmond to enter Albany schools. The school mascot is the cougar and the school colors are red and white. The current principal as of the 2017‚Äì2018 school year is Alexa Ritchie, who was formerly the principal of Marin Elementary School in the same school district. Academic competitions Albany participates in many local competitions, including NAQT, NOSB's Otter Bowl (which they won in 2006 and took fourth in nationwide), and the National Science Bowl, in which they also took fourth place nationwide. The school hosts a well-established Model United Nations program. In the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year, Albany became home to a forensic (Speech and Debate) team. The Albany High Speech and Debate team is a member of the Golden Gate Speech Association and the National Forensic League. Both programs are established in club format; while other local schools have classes dedicated solely to Model UN and debate, Albany runs both programs as student clubs. Instagram postings controversy On May 1, 2017, four Albany High students filed suit against the school arguing that they had been punished unfairly for their involvement with racist harassment on Instagram. The students and their lawyers claimed that the school had violated their First Amendment rights by punishing them for actions that took place outside of school grounds and outside of school hours. The complaints also stated that the students were refused protection by Jeff Anderson as a growing body of students gathered outside of the office where they were meeting for a restorative justice session. As the four students attempted to leave through their peers, two of the students were struck in the head by an enraged demonstrator, while others hid in a locked vehicle for safety, prompting complaints that the school mishandled the situation and allowed an unruly assembly to take place. Many teachers did not take attendance or mark students as absent for attending the unsanctioned assembly. In the interim between the original incident and the lawsuit, principal Jeff Anderson was reassigned within the district, and former principal Ron Rosenbaum took over as interim principal for the remainder of the school year. On May 26, Judge James Donato granted an order to halt the expulsion hearing for plaintiff Kevin Chen, which was scheduled for June 1 of that year. The ruling stated, \\"The Court is also advised that Chen is a rising senior about to start the college admissions process, and being wrongly expelled would likely cause irreparable harm to his admission prospects.\\" Block schedule Albany High changed from a 7-period per day schedule to a block schedule during the 2005‚Äì2006 school year. Instead of having seven 57-minute periods per day, the new block schedule consists of two blocks, A and B. Block A, on Tuesday and Thursday, has 94-minute periods for periods 1, 3, 5***, and 7. Block B, on Wednesday and Friday, has 94-minute periods for periods 2, 4, and 6 with an added 40-minute Advisory period between 2nd and 4th period. On Monday, all classes last for 51 minutes. The first class always begins at 8:10 am, except on finals week.

Life The son of Sa'd, Abu'l-Hasan Ali became sultan in 1464, and in 1477 he refused to pay tribute to the Crown of Castile. In 1481 he ordered an invasion to the city of Zahara de la Sierra by surprise, killing and enslaving the unarmed Christian Zaharans. This action was taken by Isabella I of Castile as a reason to start the war against Granada. He was the father of Muhammad XII (also known as Boabdil), the last sultan of Granada, by his relative Aixa. He took a captive Christian slave named Isabel de Sol√≠s and fell in love with her, renamed after her conversion as his second wife Zoraida or Soraya (Thuraya, \\"Star\\"), the daughter of Sancho Jim√©nez de Sol√≠s, Alcalde of La Pe√±a de Martos. He had two sons. There are no other biographical elements on Zoraya: She could have joined him in his exile with her two sons. It seems that after the death of Abu'l-Hasan, Zoraya and her two sons re- converted to Catholicism. The sons took the names of Juan de Granada and Fernando de Granada.

From 2006 when it lost its regional accreditation to 2017 when it regained that accreditation, it operated as a part of El Camino College. Prior to and subsequent to the partnership with El Camino College, the college was operated by the Compton Community College District. History Statue of Apollo The Archer on the College Compton Center campus. Compton Community College was established in 1927 as a component of the Compton Union High School District. From 1932 to 1949, it operated as a four-year junior college, incorporating the last two years of high school as well as the first two years of college. In 1933 the campus was devastated by a major earthquake which struck the region, leaving two buildings standing. Nobody on campus was killed. In the 1940s several thousand Compton College students entered the armed forces and during World War II the campus housed a military unit and a defense plant. In 1950 voters approved a bond issue separating the college from the high school district. The new college campus was then constructed at the college's present site, 1111 East Artesia Boulevard. Classes began on the new campus in the Fall of 1953. In the 1960s the composition of the student body changed dramatically from predominantly Caucasian to overwhelmingly African-American. As a result, it has sometimes been called \\"California‚Äôs historically black college.\\" In 1970 the Board of Trustees appointed the institution's first African-American President/Superintendent, Dr. Abel B. Sykes, Jr. Highlights during his 14-year administration included the construction of the first two new campus buildings since 1952: the Jane Astredo Allied Health Building and the Abel B. Sykes, Jr. Child Development Center (named after him in 1995). The 1980s was a period of reduced funding and partial retrenchment for the institution, but by the early 1990s the college had once again stabilized. The second major demographic shift occurred in the 1990s, making the campus population 46% African-American and 46% Hispanic (3% White, Non-Hispanic; 3% APISA; 2% Other). In 1996 the Board appointed Ulis C. Williams as Interim President/Superintendent and in January, 1997 made this appointment permanent. =Loss of accreditation= In 2004 the college began experiencing significant turmoil caused by a \\"corrupt board and financial insolvency\\". In May 2004, the state installed Arthur Tyler, Jr. as Special Trustee to assist the Compton Community College District toward achieving fiscal stability and integrity. Subsequently, in August, the State Chancellor issued another Executive Order (2004-02) authorizing the continuing authority of the Special Trustee to manage the College, and to suspend, for up to one year, the powers of the governing board of the College, or of any members of that board, and to exercise any powers or responsibilities or to take any official action with respect to the management of the College. Interim President/Superintendent, Dr. Rita Cepeda was hired in February, 2005 to assist with the recovery of the College. The following year, the Executive Director of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), Dr. Barbara Beno informed the College of the Commission's decision to terminate the College's accreditation. In July, 2005, the State Chancellor assigned Dr. Jamillah Moore, Senior Vice Chancellor of the California Community Colleges system as the interim President/Superintendent and Dr. Charles Ratliff as the Special Trustee with the impending departure of both Dr. Cepeda and Mr. Tyler. The College began its appeal to the Commission regarding the termination decision. On March 1, 2006, a third Special Trustee, Mr. Thomas Henry, was assigned to the College District to continue with the implementation of AB 61 and the development of AB 318 to keep the doors open for students. On June 30, 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 318 (D-Dymally) into law giving the College District $30 million loan for recovery and the opportunity to partner with a college of good standing to offer accredited courses. The bill also gave the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) the responsibilities to conduct a comprehensive assessment and to develop a recovery plan for the College to regain its accreditation. Five months later, the Special Trustee approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with El Camino College District to solidify the partnerships between the two districts. Under this MOU, the campus became a center of El Camino College. The Office of the President/Superintendent was replaced by the Office of Provost/Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The center is officially established as the Compton Community Educational Center. At midnight, Compton Community College lost its accreditation. Shortly thereafter, the Compton Community Educational Center officially became part of El Camino College with Dr. Doris P. Givens serving as the Provost/CEO. Dr. Lawrence M. Cox became Provost/CEO from 2008 to 2010. =Accreditation regained= On June 7, 2017, Compton College was restored to full accreditation. This followed years of rebuilding under president Keith Curry who was provost of the campus while it was partnered with El Camino College. Campus The library on campus opened in 2014. Its opening was originally scheduled for 2007. At that time it had a cost of $25 million.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 15, 2004. Plot During a school field trip, Bart notices a change in Milhouse's behavior. Milhouse talks back to Mrs. Krabappel and wanders away from the group. He causes mischief with Bart, and tells him that he does not care what anyone thinks of him anymore. Finally, Milhouse reveals that he is moving to Capitol City with his mother. Bart visits Milhouse in Capitol City, only to find that Milhouse has dyed his hair blonde, is wearing fashionable clothes, and is cultivating a \\"bad-boy\\" image, even going so far as to give Bart a wedgie in front of his new Capitol City friends. At home, seeing how depressed Bart is (who even cries), Marge suggests he spend more time with Lisa. The two begin to bond by washing the car and riding bikes, and after they discover an Indian burial mound together, they become best friends. Meanwhile, at Moe's Tavern, Apu and Manjula are celebrating their anniversary, and Homer realizes he does not have a gift for Marge for their anniversary. After being thrown out of the bar, Homer sits on the street and people start giving him money. He dances and earns enough money to buy Marge some flowers. He also does a rendition of the song \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" and asks for money. Homer continues his panhandling, and eventually makes enough money to buy Marge a pair of diamond earrings. When he continues panhandling afterward, angry bums bring Marge to see what Homer is doing. Marge is mortified and angry, but cannot bring herself to throw the earrings away. Milhouse returns to Springfield when his father wins custody of Milhouse via court order. After she finds out Bart told Milhouse about their secret Indian burial mound, Lisa feels that Bart is acting like their friendship never existed and that he has been using her to fill a void. Bart, however, shows her that he still values her as a sister by giving her a set of cards with nice things he will do for her on them, and the two hug.

In 2003, Ho broke into Hollywood with her debut American single \\"Where Did Love Go,\\" produced by David Foster and Peter Rafelson. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play \\"Breakout\\" Chart in December 2003. Subsequently, three of her singles, \\"One With You\\", \\"Without Love\\" and \\"Gone\\" reached No. 1 positions on the Billboard Dance Chart. \\"Ends Of The Earth\\" also joined the abovementioned three singles to reach No. 1 positions on the UK MusicWeek Chart. Since 2003, Ho has worked with a number of musicians such as Jimmy Harry, Diane Warren, Tony Moran, Chris Cox, Eric Kupper, Jason Nevins, Moto Blanco and the Underdogs. In 2010, Sun Ho was questioned by the Government of Singapore when City Harvest Church came under investigation for alleged misuse of funds.http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_541030.html After the City Harvest Church trial began which created an extended scrutiny of Ho's singing career, two suspension orders were imposed against her where \\"Ms Ho is not involved even though she is a direct beneficiary\\". She resumed her role as the Executive Director of the church in Singapore after they were lifted in May 2013 by the Commissioner of Charities (COC). On 19 October 2015, two days before the sentencing of her husband Kong Hee, Ho was ordained by Michael Scales from Nyack College. On 21 October 2015, the six City Harvest Church leaders were sentenced to between 21 months and eight years' jail on Friday (20 November) for misappropriating S$50 million of church funds as well as criminal breach of trust, and falsification of accounts. Ho's husband, senior pastor Kong Hee, the founder of the church, was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for criminal breach of trust. John Lam, former secretary of the church's management board, was sentenced to three years' jail. Sharon Tan, former finance manager, was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Former board member Chew Eng Han was given a sentence of six years and senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, five years and six months. Serina Wee, former finance manager for the church, was handed a five-year jail term. The November 2016 appeal revealed the City Harvest Church leaders spent $24 million on Ms Sun Ho‚Äôs musical foray into the United States which included a house in Hollywood that cost $28,000 a month in rent; a whole entourage of staff; a $1.9 million paycheck to rapper Wyclef Jean to produce the \\"China Wine\\" video; as well as another $500,000 to sweep up her albums when they tanked. Awards On 6 November 2003, Ho was among 10 international nominees to be presented \\"The Outstanding Young Person of the World 2003\\" Award for her social work in Asia. The ceremony was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, under the auspices of JCI (Junior Chamber International). Ho is the fourth Asian celebrity to receive the award after Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau and Michelle Yeoh. Controversy Following the conviction of husband Kong Hee in October 2015, the issue of \\"love gifts\\" from a few churchgoers deposited in a multi-purpose account (MPA) was highlighted. The MPA was set up by Kong and Ho between 2006 and 2010 from which expenses were paid for with church members' donations. Examples of expenses included more than $300,000 was spent on travel, more than $100,000 on food, more than $100,000 on make-up and medical costs that hit more than $100,000. Ho's earnings of more than $400,000 a year came from these gifts, and Kong admitted in court that donors were oblivious about Ho's earnings. The 2012 Commissioner of Charities (COC) inquiry found that $3 million was purportedly spent by Sun Ho from the MPA between April 2007 and March 2010. Givers to the MPA were not told the Crossover project was in fact funded by illegal bonds and were persuaded to give towards the project's costs. Besides Sun's 'salary' from the MPA of $400,000/year, Sun was receiving an official salary from Xtron at US$10,000/mth and entitled to 25% of project gross income, regardless and before costs. Today, Sun Ho continues to sit on the Board of City Harvest Church.

It is reportedly naturalized in many places: Corsica, Portugal, the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, the Scilly Isles of Great Britain, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ascension Island, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Chile, California, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands.  Description  Perennial bulbous geophyte with one to two erect solid stems which appear in late summer. The inflorescence bears 2‚Äì12 showy fragrant funnel-shaped flowers on a 'naked' (leafless) stem, which gives it the common name of naked-lady-lily. The pink flowers which may be up to 10 cm in length, appear in the autumn before the leaves (hysteranthy) which are narrow and strap shaped.  Taxonomy and etymology  Amaryllis belladonna is one of the two species in the genus Amaryllis as currently circumscribed. Belladonna is a Latin epithet meaning beautiful lady. There are many common names around the world, for instance in the Azores, Portugal one name is Meninas para a Escola (girls go to school) referring to the flowers blooming when the girls in their pink uniforms are starting the new school year.  Habitat  A. belladonna in California In South Africa the plants are found growing among rocks.  Cultivation  The bulbs are best planted just below the surface of the soil, with the neck of the bulb level with the surface. In colder climates mulching or lifting and overwintering is required. The bulbs may be propagated from offsets. Amaryllis bulbs require little watering and are drought tolerant. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Watsons Bay is located 11 km north-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Woollahra. Watsons Bay sits on the end of the South Head peninsula and takes its name from the sheltered bay and anchorage on its western side, in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). It provides views across the harbour to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Gap is an ocean cliff on the eastern side with views to Manly at North Head and the Pacific Ocean. Vaucluse is the only adjacent suburb, to the south. History =Aboriginal history= The original inhabitants of the area that is now known as Watsons Bay, were the Cadigal people. The Cadigal referred to the area as Kutti. This indigenous group of people fished and collected shellfish in the waters and bays off South Head. They acquired their resources from Camp Cove and carved rock engravings there, which have since eroded from the cliff faces and rock surfaces that line the coastline. =European settlement= Watson's Bay was named after Robert Watson (1756‚Äì1819), formerly of HMS Sirius, when he had to beach his three vessels at Camp Cove for many years because of their being potentially sold by the Provost Marshal. Watson was appointed harbour pilot and harbourmaster of the port of Sydney in 1811 and the first superintendent of Macquarie Lighthouse in 1816. The first grant of was made to Edward Laing in 1793 in the Camp Cove Area. Watsons Bay was an isolated fishing village until development began in the 1860s. On the night of 20 August 1857, Dunbar a sailing ship became shipwrecked against the cliffs below The Gap, with 121 lives lost. The Dunbar had mistaken the bay of The Gap for the harbour entrance. In 1910, at Jacob‚Äôs Ladder, the anchor from the ship was recovered along with other relics and were placed in a museum behind the old Town Hall in Military Road by Vaucluse Council. The anchor was transferred to the cliffs of Gap Park by Ald. Coombes and a memorial was unveiled in August 1930. Today, The Gap is known as a notorious suicide spot. =Trams= Former tram terminus, Gap Park, c1949 A walk from Watsons Bay to Vaucluse The City to Watson's Bay tram line was extended from Edgecliff to Signal Hill Station, Watson's Bay in 1903 with further extensions to Gap Park in 1909. The latter extension included a new tram terminus adjacent to The Gap and a tram cutting cut into the rock face in Gap Park that ran above and parallel to Gap Road that gradually descended to street level before terminating.Drain Grate, Rose Bay. Heritage, Roads and Traffic Authority. Retrieved 22 August 2007. The line from the city commenced with a loop at the corner of Erskine and Day Streets near Wynyard station. It then proceeded south down Day Street before turning left into King Street passing through Queen's Square at St James station. It then made a right hand turn into College Street, and headed south before turning left into Boomerang Street. The line then continued left into William Street, through King's Cross and then along Bayswater Road and into New South Head Road at Rushcutters Bay. The line then followed the course of New and Old South Head Roads before turning right into Gap Park. After turning right into Gap Park a single track passed through narrow rock cuttings, low cliffs and rugged back-drops, turning its way down to the terminus at Watsons Bay. The line had its own depot and city terminus and operated independently, although it was connected to the main Sydney tram network. In 1949, the line from Rose Bay to Watson's Bay closed, but reopened in 1950 due to public protest. In 1950, the line down King Street to Erskine Street closed and a new terminus constructed at Queens Square. The remainder of the line closed in 1960, the tracks were removed and in 1964 the Council re-vegetated the area around the former tramway cutting in gap park with the object of restoring the area. When walking up the steps to The Gap at Watsons Bay, there is flat ground in between two sets of steps. This continues for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way. The present-day State Transit route 324 follows the route of the former tram line as far as the point where the tramway turned off Old South Head Road into Gap Park. The bus and tram routes meet again near the terminus in Military Road.Gap Park History - NSW Government =Sydney Harbour defences WWII= Foundations of the anti-sub boom net winch house In 1942, during World War II, the Sydney Harbour anti- submarine boom net was constructed on Georges Head and was designed to prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a boom net winch house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter Sydney Harbour in what became known as the Attack on Sydney Harbour.Gill, George Hermon (1968). Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p 65Stevens, David (2005). A Critical Vulnerability, p 193 One of the Japanese midget submarines became entangled in the boom net; and, after unsuccessful attempts to free the submarine, the crew detonated charges within the sub, killing themselves and destroying their sub in the process.http://www.combinedfleet.com/Tully/sydney42.html During this period, Nielsen Park was used as an anti-aircraft base. The base had its own interim wooden barracks, searchlights and anti-aircraft guns.Walking Coastal Sydney In Gap Park, a gun emplacement for a small calibre gun, which was never installed was also intended for use during World War II. =Christina Stead= The novelist Christina Stead lived in 14 Pacific Street from 1911 to 1928, after which she went overseas.

Professionally, he was known as \\"Slow Burn\\", owing to his ability to portray on screen characters whose anger slowly rises in frustrating situations. Kennedy in many of his roles used exasperated facial expressions, performed very deliberately, to convey his rising anger or \\"burn\\", often rubbing his hand over his bald head and across his face in an effort to control his temper. One memorable example of his slow-burn comedy technique can be seen in the 1933 Marx Brothers' film Duck Soup in which he plays a sidewalk lemonade vendor who is harassed and increasingly provoked by Harpo and Chico.\\"Duck Soup...Peanuts‚Äù, scene from Duck Soup showing Kennedy's sidewalk encounter with Harpo and Chico Marx and his \\"slow burn\\" reactions to their antics. Excerpt published by Niteesh Wadhwa July 23, 2015 on YouTube, San Bruno, California. Retrieved July 22, 2019. Early years Kennedy was born on April 26, 1890, in Monterey County, California, to Canadians Neil Kennedy and Annie Quinn. He attended San Rafael High School before taking up boxing. He was a light-heavyweight and once went 14 rounds with Jack Dempsey. After boxing, he worked as a singer in vaudeville, musical comedy and light opera. Film career Making his debut in 1911,Kennedy performed with some of the biggest film comedians in the United States, including Roscoe Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang series. He was also one of the original Keystone Kops. Lahue, Kalton (1971); Mack Sennett's Keystone: The man, the myth and the comedies; New York: Barnes; ; p. 194 Kennedy's burly frame originally suited him for villainous or threatening roles in silent pictures. By the 1920s Kennedy was working for producer Hal Roach, who kept the actor busy playing supporting roles in short comedies. Kennedy starred in one short, A Pair of Tights (1928), in which he plays a tightwad determined to spend as little as possible on a date. His antics with comedian Stuart Erwin are reminiscent of Roach's Laurel and Hardy comedies, produced concurrently. Roach also used Kennedy as a director on half a dozen two-reeler comedies. In 1930, Edgar Kennedy was featured by RKO-Pathe in a pair of short-subject comedies, Next Door Neighbors and Help Wanted, Female. Kennedy's characterization of a short-tempered householder was so effective that RKO built a series around it. The \\"Average Man\\" comedies starred Kennedy as a blustery, stubborn everyman determined to accomplish a household project or get ahead professionally, despite the meddling of his featherbrained wife (usually Florence Lake), her freeloading brother (originally William Eugene, then Jack Rice) and his dubious mother-in- law (Dot Farley). Kennedy pioneered the kind of domestic situation comedy that later became familiar on television. Each installment would end with Edgar embarrassed, humbled or defeated, looking at the camera and doing his patented slow burn. The Edgar Kennedy Series, with its theme song \\"Chopsticks\\", became a standard part of the movie-going experience: Kennedy made six \\"Average Man\\" shorts a year for 17 years. In 1938, Kennedy worked as a straight man for British comedian Will Hay in Hey! Hey! USA. Kennedy became so identified with frustration that practically every studio hired him to play hotheads. He often played dumb cops, detectives, and even a prison warden; sometimes he was a grouchy moving man, truck driver, or blue-collar workman. His character usually lost his temper at least once. In Diplomaniacs, Kennedy presides over an international tribunal, where Wheeler & Woolsey want to do something about world peace. \\"Well, ya can't do anything about it \\", yells Kennedy, \\"this is a \\" Kennedy, established as the poster boy for frustration, even starred in an instructional film titled The Other Fellow, in which loudmouthed roadhog Edgar always vents his anger on other drivers (each one played by Kennedy as well), little realizing that, to them, is \\"the other fellow.\\" Perhaps his most unusual roles were as a puppeteer in the detective mystery The Falcon Strikes Back and as a philosophical bartender inspired to create exotic cocktails in Harold Lloyd's last film, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock (1947). He also played comical detectives opposite two titans of acting: John Barrymore in Twentieth Century (1934) and Rex Harrison in Unfaithfully Yours (1948). In the latter film he tells Harrison's character, a symphony conductor, \\"Nobody handles Handel like you handle Handel.\\" Death Kennedy died of throat cancer at the Motion Picture Hospital, San Fernando Valley on November 9, 1948. Tom Kennedy (no relation) and Charles Coburn spoke at the funeral service held at St. Gregory's Church, with Chester Conklin, Jimmy Finlayson, Del Lord, and Billy Gilbert among the mourners. His body was interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, Los Angeles County, California.

In mathematics, Burnside's theorem in group theory states that if G is a finite group of order p^a q^b where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are non-negative integers, then G is solvable. Hence each non- Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes. History The theorem was proved by using the representation theory of finite groups. Several special cases of it had previously been proved by Burnside, Jordan, and Frobenius. John Thompson pointed out that a proof avoiding the use of representation theory could be extracted from his work on the N-group theorem, and this was done explicitly by for groups of odd order, and by for groups of even order. simplified the proofs. Proof This proof is by contradiction. Let paqb be the smallest product of two prime powers, such that there is a non-solvable group G whose order is equal to this number. :*G is a simple group with trivial center and a is not zero. If G had a nontrivial proper normal subgroup H, then (because of the minimality of G), H and G/H would be solvable, so G as well, which would contradict our assumption. So G is simple. If a were zero, G would be a finite q-group, hence nilpotent, and therefore solvable. Similarly, G cannot be abelian, otherwise it would be nilpotent. As G is simple, its center must therefore be trivial. :* There is an element g of G which has qd conjugates, for some d > 0. By the first statement of Sylow's theorem, G has a subgroup S of order pa. Because S is a nontrivial p-group, its center Z(S) is nontrivial. Fix a nontrivial element g\\\\in Z(S). The number of conjugates of g is equal to the index of its stabilizer subgroup Gg, which divides the index qb of S (because S is a subgroup of Gg). Hence this number is of the form qd. Moreover, the integer d is strictly positive, since g is nontrivial and therefore not central in G. :* There exists a nontrivial irreducible representation œÅ with character œá, such that its dimension n is not divisible by q and the complex number œá(g) is not zero. Let (œái)1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ h be the family of irreducible characters of G over ‚ÑÇ (here œá1 denotes the trivial character). Because g is not in the same conjugacy class as 1, the orthogonality relation for the columns of the group's character table gives: : 0=\\\\sum_{i=1}^h \\\\chi_i(1)\\\\chi_i(g)= 1 + \\\\sum_{i=2}^h \\\\chi_i(1)\\\\chi_i(g). Now the œái(g) are algebraic integers, because they are sums of roots of unity. If all the nontrivial irreducible characters which don't vanish at g take a value divisible by q at 1, we deduce that : -\\\\frac1q=\\\\sum_{i\\\\ge 2,~\\\\chi_i(g) e 0}\\\\frac{\\\\chi_i(1)}q\\\\chi_i(g) is an algebraic integer (since it is a sum of integer multiples of algebraic integers), which is absurd. This proves the statement. :* The complex number qdœá(g)/n is an algebraic integer. The set of integer-valued class functions on G, Z(‚Ñ§[G]), is a commutative ring, finitely generated over ‚Ñ§. All of its elements are thus integral over ‚Ñ§, in particular the mapping u which takes the value 1 on the conjugacy class of g and 0 elsewhere. The mapping A:Z(\\\\mathbb{Z}[G]) \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{End}(\\\\mathbb{C}^n) which sends a class function f to : \\\\sum_{s\\\\in G} f(s)\\\\rho(s) is a ring homomorphism. Because œÅ(s)‚àí1A(u)œÅ(s) = A(u) for all s, Schur's lemma implies that A(u) is a homothety ŒªIn. Its trace nŒª is equal to : \\\\sum_{s\\\\in G} f(s)\\\\chi(s)=q^d\\\\chi(g). Because the homothety ŒªIn is the homomorphic image of an integral element, this proves that the complex number Œª = qdœá(g)/n is an algebraic integer. :* The complex number œá(g)/n is an algebraic integer. Since q is relatively prime to n, by B√©zout's identity there are two integers x and y such that: : xq^d + yn=1\\\\quad\\\\text{therefore}\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\chi(g)}{n}=x\\\\frac{q^d\\\\chi(g)}{n} + y\\\\chi(g). Because a linear combination with integer coefficients of algebraic integers is again an algebraic integer, this proves the statement. :* The image of g, under the representation œÅ, is a homothety. Let Œ∂ be the complex number œá(g)/n. It is an algebraic integer, so its norm N(Œ∂) (i.e. the product of its conjugates, that is the roots of its minimal polynomial over ‚Ñö) is a nonzero integer. Now Œ∂ is the average of roots of unity (the eigenvalues of œÅ(g)), hence so are its conjugates, so they all have an absolute value less than or equal to 1\\\\. Because the absolute value of their product N(Œ∂) is greater than or equal to 1, their absolute value must all be 1, in particular Œ∂, which means that the eigenvalues of œÅ(g) are all equal, so œÅ(g) is a homothety. :* Conclusion Let N be the kernel of œÅ. The homothety œÅ(g) is central in Im(œÅ) (which is canonically isomorphic to G/N), whereas g is not central in G. Consequently, the normal subgroup N of the simple group G is nontrivial, hence it is equal to G, which contradicts the fact that œÅ is a nontrivial representation. This contradiction proves the theorem. References  *James, Gordon; and Liebeck, Martin (2001). Representations and Characters of Groups (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press. .

Hononegah had a strong influence on the Roscoe-Rockton area; the high school of the four towns (the other 2 being Shirland and Harrison) and the main thoroughfare connecting the towns are both named after her. Biography Most of what is known about Hononegah is printed in Edson I. Carr's history of Rockton, which was published in 1898. Modern scholarship, however, has discovered more about her background, and has cast doubt on several of Carr's claims. Hononegah (from the Winnebago hinu, the designation that she was the eldest daughter of her family, ni, \\"water\\", and -ga which clarifies it's a name.) was born in the Teejopera (day-jope-ra), or \\"Four Lakes Country\\", which is modern day Madison, Wisconsin. This is given as her birthplace by N. W. Jipson. She is first seen as living in a village along the Rock River in what is now Ogle County, Illinois, and at the time of her birth, there is no evidence of the Winnebago living in this area until 1824 when Thomas Forsyth reports the existence of twelve to fourteen Winnebago villages located on the Rock River and its tributaries south of Lake Koshkonong. Hononegah was portrayed by Carr as a Pottawatomie princess and a daughter of a chief. Her father, known only by his English name \\"Blacksmith\\", was at least half Winnebago and part Pottawatomie. Her mother was named Inoquer, and was pure Winnebago. She had one sister, Wehunsegah. After the death of her father and mother, Hononegah and her sister were raised by her uncles Conosaipkah, Estche-eshesheek, and Horohonkak, and her family moved to Illinois to a Winnebago village on the site of modern-day Grand Detour. =Grand Detour, 1820-1829= Mack (1798‚Äì1850) arrived in Grand Detour from Detroit, Michigan in 1820 and worked as a clerk in a trading post there. How and when Hononegah met Mack has not survived, only a vague tradition that Mack had become sick from fever and that Hononegah nursed him back to health. Mack became somewhat of an advisor to the local chief, but it is believed he was despised by the inhabitants because he refused to sell alcohol and firearms to the people and hadn't taken one of their own as a wife. Several versions of the story survive, but all versions agree that the inhabitants attempted to murder him. One story indicates that on one occasion Hononegah hid Mack in a barrel, and in another story, Hononegah met Mack in the woods to warn him of a plot to murder him. Mack became so grateful to her that he decided to be her husband. The formalization of their relationship took place in or shortly before February 1829, when Mack bought a French trader's cabin. Mack would have been about 31, while Hononegah was just 15. They may have had a child who died at birth during the course of 1829. Their first surviving child, Rosa, was born November 14, 1830. Eight additional children were born to Stephen Mack and Hononegah: Mary born July 15, 1832; William H. born On September 14,1834; Louisa born May 6, 1836; Thomas H. born Feb. 9, 1838; Henry C. born Dec. 1, 1839; Edward born Dec. 3, 1841; Matilda born Nov. 26, 1843 and Caroline born Oct. 16, 1845. In 1840 Mack and Hononegah were married in Winnebago County, Illinois by William Hulin, Justice of the Peace. At the time Mack was concerned that if he were not legally married to Hononegah that his children would have difficulties inheriting his estate. =Bird's Grove, 1829-1835= Their problems did not end after their marriage. During the later part of 1829, they were forced to flee Grand Detour. They found their way to a Winnebago village at the present site of Hononegah Forest Preserve between the present Illinois villages of Rockton and Roscoe. The inhabitants pledged to protect them, and there Mack established a new trading post near where Dry Run Creek meets the Rock River. On May 9, 1832, Mack and Hononegah were run out of their trading post by Black Hawk's warriors who were sent there to confiscate Mack's supply of gunpowder. At this juncture, there is another romance about how Mack hid out on Webber's Island and that Hononegah brought Mack food and fresh water until Black Hawk's warriors had left, but this story is doubtful. Mack served during the Black Hawk War from Chicago as a guide. After the hostilities ended, Mack and Hononegah returned to their trading post. =Pecatonic, 1835-1847= On July 25, 1835, William Talcott and his son Thomas visited Mack at his trading post. It was then that Mack announced his intentions to found a community on the south bluff overlooking the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, which he wanted to call Pecatonic. The following autumn when the Talcotts returned to the area with their families, Mack had relocated at the site of his proposed community. By June 1838, Jean Baptiste Beaubien, a veteran trader in Chicago, and John P. Bradstreet had become partners with Mack and began selling lots in Pecatonic. Mack made out very well in the 1837 treaty between the government and the Winnebago, and in 1839 he used some of the money he received to build a two- story frame house with a cellar. This house survives in what is now the Macktown Forest Preserve. The Talcotts lived north of the river where they dug a millrace and built a gristmill. They preferred to call the settlement Rockton, which eventually became the name of the village. What little that is known about Hononegah comes from reminiscences of early settlers of Pecatonic and later collected and published by Edson Carr. She was highly knowledgeable in herbal medicine and was often called upon by everyone when they became sick. She liked designing her own clothes and decorating them with beadwork. Occasionally she outdid the white women with her fashion creations, and there was one dress that was so memorable that a description of it has survived. The settlers saw her wearing a white woman's garb on only one occasion, and she was so uncomfortable that she was never seen wearing white women's clothes again. There are also traditions among some Rockton families that when their ancestors were small boys, they paddled the canoe while Hononegah speared fish. Modern scholarship has succeeded to uncover the truth about her background but has done little to reveal any more about her life and character. =Death of Hononegah= Hononegah died on September 8, 1847. In a letter to his sister Lovicy Cooper, dated October 6, 1847, Mack describes her final illness and expresses a deep and heartfelt tribute to her: > \\"I have the melancholy duty to inform you that the death published in the > paper I sent you was that of my wife. Her health had been failing for > several months but was not so as to prevent her from taking the ordinary > care of her family until she was attacked by what the doctor called a > bilious fever but what I called a lung fever - of this she was sick eight or > nine days and died. She was sensible to the last moment and took leave of > her children and friends a few hours before she died. > > \\"You say that by the notice in the paper you perceive she died a Christian. > \\"If I know what a Christian is, she was one, not by profession but by her > every act, her every deed proclaimed her a follower of Christ. In her the > hungry and the naked have lost a benefactor, the sick a nurse and I have > lost a friend who taught me to reverence God by doing good to his creatures. > > \\"Her funeral proved that I am not the only sufferer by her loss. My house > is large, but it was filled to overflowing by mourning friends who assembled > to pay the last sad duties to her who had set them the example how to live > and how to die.\\" Years later William C. Blinn related that after Hononegah's > funeral, \\"a little knot of neighbors were speaking of the loss. George > Stevens, the postmaster, one of the parties, said most impressively, 'The > best woman in Winnebago County died last night', the neighbors all nodding > in agreement.\\" Today, the spirits of Hononegah and Stephen Mack live on in Rockton and the surrounding communities. There is Hononegah High School, Stephen Mack Middle School, Whitman Post Elementary School, Hononegah and Macktown forest preserves, and various other parks, buildings, and businesses that use the names Macktown or Hononegah. A cheerleader from the high school is designated \\"Princess Hononegah\\" and performs a dance at most major school sporting events.

The process is usually performed on a rifle, and can be accomplished either with the naked eye, or with a specialized device called a boresighter.  Optical boresighting  Optical boresighting, also referred to as eyeball boresighting, as the name suggests, involves using the naked eye and the bore axis of a firearm to dial in the sights of a firearm. Based on the type of firearm the procedure for optical bore sighting will vary. For AR style rifles the upper receiver can be dropped from the lower receiver and the bolt carrier group (BCG) can be removed exposing a clear line of sight through the barrel. With the upper receiver fixed in place you can then co-witness thorough the barrel and the sights on the top of the rifle, while doing this you can visually align the bore axis with the sights on a desired target. For bolt actions rifles the process is the same aside from the ability to remove different receivers, but the bolt can still be removed to view through the barrel. Once you are able to align the bore axis and the sights on the firearm you should then be able to at least get shots on or close to the target. With the rifle reassembled you should be able to put shots down range and make more fine tuned adjustments. A draw back of using the naked eye to boresight is that it can be difficult due to the tunnel vision and lack of brightness, especially with longer-barreled guns. A more advanced method of boresighting uses a collimator boresighter, an optical attachment similar to a scope sight, which fits onto the muzzle end of the barrel via a bore-diameter arbor and projects a grid pattern onto the sight picture. Using this method, the normal sight (which is fixed to the receiver) and the collimator (which is fixed to the barrel) can be sighted to match. Most collimators have grid patterns for rechecking the zero after the barrel is sighted.  Laser boresighting  A more modern method of boresighting is to use a laser pointer rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point of aim. This method is preferable because it has less parallax, allows more movement in the gun as the projected laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and does not require the removing the bolt. As laser technology has become less expensive, laser boresighters have become popular for sighting in rifles. One type of laser boresighter is shaped like a cartridge, and when inserted into the chamber projects a laser beam through the barrel onto the target. The user then adjusts the iron sights or the scope reticle are aligned to the projected laser dot. Another type of laser boresighter is more commonly used and is attached to the muzzle of the barrel, either by inserting into the bore (\\"arbor\\" type) or via a magnet, and is held in alignment with the barrel and projects a laser beam onto the target. Again, the user aligns the sights to the laser dot on the target. No matter which method of bore sighting is used, the result is to align the sights to the spot where the barrel is pointing at a particular distance. Because of variations in the trajectory of ammunition and other factors, the bore-sighted rifle will probably not shoot to that exact spot, and live ammunition will need to be fired to further fine-tune the sighting process. Accuracy is the measure of how well the sighted object is represented. It can be measured from a specific decision-making circumstance, like the orientation of notches of a gun barrel. Alternatively, the device could be designed to accommodate a range of circumstances and still be sufficiently accurate.

He soon finds himself in a battle of wills with his first officer, the sadistic and supercilious first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget (Dirk Bogarde). The lieutenant believes that Crawford is too soft on his crew, and also disagrees with the captain's decision to follow his orders to sail to Corsica despite word that Napoleon's army has overrun much of Italy. Scott-Padget has powerful family connections, which he has used in the past to \\"beach\\" two previous commanding officers with whom he disagreed. Knowing that Crawford is helpless to intervene, Scott-Padget subjects the Captain's son, Midshipman Harvey Crawford (David Robinson), to excessive daily punishments so as to gain leverage over the captain. Meanwhile, some of the crew, led by seaman Vizard (Anthony Quayle), are preparing to mutiny for better conditions, in conjunction with similar efforts throughout the British fleet. They eventually pledge virtually the entire crew. In the Mediterranean, the Defiant encounters a French frigate escorting a merchant ship. After a sharp engagement, a boarding party from the Defiant captures the French frigate, and the merchantman surrenders. Crawford dispatches his son as part of the prize crew tasked to sail the captured merchantman to a British port, thereby placing him out of Scott-Padget's reach. Crawford tells Scott-Padget that bringing his son with him was a mistake, but now he's \\"put it right!\\" He further vows to take actions that will \\"astound\\" his second-in-command. Before long, Scott-Padget is confined to quarters as punishment for insubordination. His humiliation is compounded by the requirement that he appear on deck every two hours in full dress uniform, a punishment usually reserved for young midshipmen. Soon, Defiant fights and captures a Venetian frigate, taking on many prisoners. Crawford is severely wounded in the action and eventually loses his arm. Discovered among the prisoners is a key aide to Napoleon, from whom the British learn important information about a planned invasion of Britain. With Crawford incapacitated, Scott-Padget takes command, but his brutality goads the crew into a premature mutiny. Appealing to their patriotism, Crawford convinces Vizard and the other mutineers to sail for the main British fleet blockading Rochefort to warn them of the impending invasion. Crawford promises to intercede for the crew as best he can, on the condition that none of the officers are harmed. As the Defiant reaches the fleet at Rochefort, they receive word that the main British fleet has already mutinied, with the Admiralty agreeing to most of the sailors' demands. The crew's jubilation at the news is cut short when a hot-headed seaman, Evans, murders Scott-Padget. Realising that they are now all doomed to punishment as mutineers, an enraged Vizard kills Evans. Their only course now is to try to escape with the ship. Just then, the French fleet sallies out from port, and a French fireship is sighted heading straight for the British flagship. As the only ship under sail, the Defiant has the unique opportunity to save the flagship. Once again, Crawford appeals to the crew's patriotism, making no promises but convincing them to intercept the fireship. Vizard is killed in the ensuing action, living just long enough to hear a message from the British admiral thanking Defiant for their gallant actions. The mutiny is over.

A foot-lambert equals 1/œÄ or 0.3183 candela per square foot, or 3.426 candela per square meter (the corresponding SI unit). The foot-lambert is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728‚Äì1777), a Swiss-German mathematician, physicist and astronomer. It is rarely used by electrical and lighting engineers, in favor of the candela per square foot or candela per square meter. The luminance of a perfect Lambertian diffuse reflecting surface in foot-lamberts is equal to the incident illuminance in foot-candles. For real diffuse reflectors, the ratio of luminance to illuminance in these units is roughly equal to the reflectance of the surface. Mathematically, :L_\\\\mathrm v = E_\\\\mathrm v \\\\times R, where :L_\\\\mathrm v is the luminance, in foot-lamberts, :E_\\\\mathrm v is the illuminance, in foot-candles, and :R is the reflectivity, expressed as a fractional number (for example, a grey card with 18% reflectivity would have R = 0.18). The foot-lambert is used in the motion picture industry for measuring the luminance of images on a projection screen. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) recommended, in SMPTE 196M, a screen luminance of 16 foot-lamberts for commercial movie theaters, when measured \\"open-gate\\" (i.e. with no film in the projector). (Typical base density of 0.05 yields peak white of about 14 fL.) The current revision of SMPTE 196M specifies 55 candela per square meter (nits). The foot- lambert is also used in the flight simulation industry to measure the highlight brightness of visual display systems. The minimum required highlight brightness varies based on the type and level of Flight Simulation Training Device (FSTD), but is generally 3‚Äì6 foot-lamberts for most devices qualified under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations.14 CFR Part 60JAR-FSTD AJAR-FSTD H Military specifications for illuminated switches, panels, and displays, such as MIL-PRF-22885 and SAE AS7788, also require luminance measurements in foot-lamberts. Luminance levels can vary from hundreds of foot-lamberts for sunlight readable switch displays per MIL-PRF-22885 to only a few foot-lamberts in night conditions for panels in accordance with SAE AS7788.

The Civil Rights Movement and Second-wave feminist movement were working towards equal rights for other minority groups in the United States. Though the student movement began a few years before the Stonewall riots, the riots helped to spur the student movement to take more action in the US. Despite this, the overall view of these gay liberation student organizations received minimal attention from contemporary LGBT historians. This oversight stems from the idea that the organizations were founded with haste as a result of the riots. Others historians argue that this group gives too much credit to groups that disagree with some of the basic principles of activist LGBT organizations. Though the times and places of the student movement vary, the goals are often similar including: abolishing sodomy laws, equality on campuses for LGBT students, increasing money for HIV/AIDS research, the legalization of same-sex marriage, to prevent the bullying and suicide of LGBT youth, and gain visibility for LGBT peoples. LGBT student organizations today have started to involve research to improve the understanding of basic activism ideas. Using historical research as a source to identify and differentiate successful approaches. The identities of student activists and their involvement tends to shape the different organizations across campuses. The student movements have not always been successful in their goals, but they have been able to bring visibility to the LGBT community in their area as well as working to promote equality for a better future for their community.Bernstein, Mary (2002). Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement. Social Science History 26:3 (fall 2002).  Australia  Many colleges in Australia have a Students' union that helps support LGBT student activism financially and otherwise. Often the right to have a safe space and LGBT officers is written into the student union policy. The LGBT student activists use media to help spread the word about issues in Australia that they deem important to the community such as Same-sex marriage. This means that LGBT students in Australia's colleges and universities have good visibility on their campuses. The students are using this visibility to try to get same-sex marriage legalized in their country. The topic of same-sex marriage being legalized in Australia was brought to the forefront of LGBT students when it became legal in Canada. Two same-sex couples traveled to Canada in order to be able to marry their partners, and then attempted to get their marriage recognized when they came back to Australia. The government then used the Marriage Act 1961 (Australia) in order to deny the recognition of the legality of their marriages. The students want to change the definition of marriage so that it is a less fascist convention and is closer to their own views of what marriage should be.  China  Groups of student activists are attempting to change teaching material in Chinese schools they believe may cause discrimination towards LGBT students. The move for this is due to the Guangzhou-based Gay and Lesbian Campus Association report that shows that 40% of the mentions within the Chinese textbooks refer to homosexuality as a mental illness. Along with changes to the textbooks, the groups want universities to allow LGBT student organizations and groups on campuses which are not accepted well on campuses either. Another thing the group wants to promote is better protection for LGBT students from bullies since 3/4 of students mention having been bullied because of their sexuality. The groups hope to change this or eliminate it by changing regulations and rules within the schools.  Mexico  In 2004, a private American school in Mexico City, Mexico was the first school in Mexico to create a Gay‚Äìstraight alliance. The GSA has succeeded in bringing attention to issues of discrimination towards the LGBT students and opened up a school-wide discussion about what the LGBT students deal with at school. The GSA is working to provide support and safe space for LGBT students, providing information about and for LGBT, and raise awareness for LGBT issues.  Canada  The country's first gay liberation movement was started at the University of Toronto in 1969 and was originally called the University of Toronto Homophile Association. It is now called LGBTOUT for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans people, of the University of Toronto. The Homophile Association was created as a student-run organization to help other LGBT students socialize in a safe environment where they wouldn't be judged for their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Their first meeting had 16 students, but their group was quickly populating the room they had booked for meetings. Waterloo Universities Gay Liberation Movement was formed in 1971 at the University of Waterloo. It is the country's oldest continuous running LGBT student organization, which is now called the Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity. Its first meeting had over 100 people attend. The organization was centred on fighting for equal rights in all branches of life including marriage and adoption rights. They ran social events, led protests, and arranged support circles. In 2017, the Conservative party in Ontario announced plans to repeal the 2015 sex-education curriculum and replace it with the 1998 version to give the party time to develop a new curriculum that pleases educators and parents. Students staged a walk-out against repealing the 2015 curriculum which included topics like same-sex marriage, consent, and gender identity. The walk-out had close to 90% participation in some schools. In 2019, the United Conservative party in Alberta announced plans to overturn a law that makes it illegal for teachers to inform parents of their child‚Äôs attendance in their school‚Äôs Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) club. In response, students led protests in 90 schools which had anywhere from dozens to hundreds of students protesting. In 2019, a counter-rally was held in support of sexual orientation and gender identity rights in Vancouver on the University of British Columbia's Point Grey campus. Jenn Smith, a transgender male, was set to hold an event on UBC‚Äôs campus about how transgender politics in schools harm children and how they harm women in society. Dozens of student protestors held signs discouraging Smith from speaking claiming his talk was hate speech as it was transphobic.  United States of America  = History = In the US the student movement began in secret in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, Stephen Donaldson and a few other students at Columbia University used the structure of the Mattachine Society to form an underground society called the Student Homophile League. That year, the group could not get university recognition due to the group not giving a list of names of the members to the school to protect them. This led to no funding or space for the group. This made it difficult to gain new members. Nevertheless, Donaldson found a way to get recognition by the university, and the group became the first recognized student gay rights group. After hearing about the SHL at Columbia students at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY began inquiring about starting their own branch on campus. The Cornell Daily Sun reported that the administration would not stop a group from forming on campus, following a tradition of acknowledging contested groups on campus. Jearld Moldenhauer founded the group in 1968 and similar to the experience Donaldson faced at Columbia, students were hesitant to join, and membership remained low. Students at Cornell who joined SHL did so under pseudonyms. At the beginning there were more heterosexual students than homosexual students, partially to attract members but at the same time was used as a protection strategy. By spring 1969 group tensions were high and a split began to occur, as some members wanted to keep focus on civil liberties and others wanted the group to only focus on gay and lesbian issues. By 1971 the group became known as the Gay Liberation Front, which was associated with such groups on the Cornell campus as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Gay Straight Alliance Sign = K-12 = In 1989 there were no known GSAs in any high school or junior high within the United States even though 97% of high school students admitted to hearing anti-gay remarks in school and many LGBT students felt unsafe enough that they would skip classes. Then LGBT and straight students at private schools in Massachusetts joined together to create the first Gay‚Äìstraight alliances. Even though the groups received much opposition, the groups popped up in more and more schools across the country. As of 2011, there are more than 4,000 GSAs in middle schools and high schools across the United States. = College and University = Arizona The University of Arizona's LGBT student group, \\"Pride Alliance,\\" has been active since the 1990s in providing visibility to LGBT students and faculty at the University. Some of the students' activism also works to provide a safe and welcoming environment for LGBT students. This goal stems from studies showing that LGBT college students have higher levels of depression, bullying, and suicide. Campus-wide activism, at the University of Arizona and at many colleges, has focused on dealing with these issues with respect for the LGBT community.Oswalt, Sara, and Tammy Wyatt. \\"Sexual Orientation and Differences in Mental Health, Stress, and Academic Performance in a National Sample of U.S. College Students.\\" Journal of Homosexuality. 58.9 (2011): 1255-1280. JSTOR. Web. 20 Mar. 2012  Florida  A renewed interest in LGBT rights brought about the formation of the Florida Collegiate Pride Coalition in 2003 with chapter from Florida Gulf Coast University, University of Central Florida, University of Miami, and University of South Florida. The group holds an annual conference where multiple LGBT Social groups meet up, including people from out of state. In 2011, the group agreed to expand to help the LGBT members and allies network with college organizations to develop growth in its members personal and professional lives. This forum of LGBT college and university students in Florida is known to work with Equality Florida. Louisiana Louisiana State University, the flagship University of Louisiana, has progressively increased the awareness of LGBT organizations throughout campus. Spectrum was an organization that began in 1977 by and for LSU students as the Gay and Lesbian Student Association. Originally students involved did not feel particularly accepted so, in turn, held their meetings at off-campus locations. In 1999 a group of students felt unhappy with the mainly private nature of the LGBT movement so they formed the Spectrum Alliance. This became the public activism group that now holds over 100 members on LSU's campus. In the fall of 2014 LSU also added a program that allows students to minor in LGBT studies. It consists of an 18-hour curriculum pinpointing social sciences created by Dr. Elaine M. Maccio who teaches in social work - where the minor is also housed. The new found program allows students who desire to obtain a better understanding of LGBT ideals and activism now have the opportunity to do so for course credit.  Indiana  In 2012, the students at University of Notre Dame were able to get an official LGBT organization after requesting the addition of one 15 times. Notre Dame was the last of the top 20 universities in the United States to add an LGBT organization. The students at Notre Dame were able to get the group by assessing the environment on campus for the LGBT students and writing a review that was submitted to the president of the school. After five months of review, the president decided that allowing the organization went along with the school's policies to embrace inclusivity.  Pennsylvania  Penn State LGBT Student Activists In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, The Pennsylvania Student Equality Coalition was founded as an independent and youth-led statewide LGBT organization by Pennsylvania students in April 2011. As of 2012, PSEC is connected with over 70 student LGBT organizations across Pennsylvania. The coalition is focused on campus-community organizing for LGBT equality in Pennsylvania and resource development for educational institutions.  Interactions and Inclusiveness on College Campuses  Over the last several years a number of studies have been done on interventions and interactions among students and LGBT groups on college campuses. Numerous studies have concluded that the more interactions undergraduates have with the LGBT community on campus, the more accepting attitudes are in the following ways \\"1.Same-sex, consensual sex. 2. Same-sex relations between adults is not unnatural. 3. Vote for a gay presidential candidate. 4. Friends with a feminine man. 5. Friends with a masculine woman. 6. Knowledge of [gay and lesbian] issues important for a future career. 7. Comfortable with a [gay, lesbian] roommate.\\" Students who frequently interact and involve themselves with campus activities are likely to be more open to views different from their own. Students who are present when an LGBT student is being harassed frequently will depend on the relation between the two. Meaning, that if the bystander knows the bullying victim or is known around campus themselves, it is more likely that they will intervene. However, intervention is less likely to occur when passive bystanders are present. Studies show that it is important for universities to foster initiatives that increase LGBT bystander interventions. Over the past decade, academic institutions have been making strides in aiding LGBT students on campus. These inclusive resources include the creation of gender- neutral housing and bathrooms, educational programming, and creating other initiatives to help foster equality. However, according to a 2010 study done at multiple institutions indicated from responses by LGBT students, that LGBT students were more likely to receive harassment and discrimination that heterosexuals. Therefore, resulting in lower education outcomes, low self- esteem, and wakened emotional, mental, and physical health.http://site.ebrary.com/lib/bsu/detail.action?docID=10734308  LGBTQ Inclusion  One of the ways that heterosexism is enabled on college campuses was through heterosexist language and communicated anti-gay sentiments towards LGBTQ people. One factor that effects the college climate they experience is how they choose or if they choose to disclose their identities. Resources have been created to help promote non-hostile environments are initiatives like The Transgender On-Campus NonDiscrimination Project (TONI). TONI is an online resource center for students, faculty, and staff alike to learn about and gather general information on transgender students in higher education. LGBTQ Resource Centers have been created on campus to help students have a welcoming space on campus. However, many argue that LGBTQ rights in the United States primarily focus on as gay and lesbian people. This leaves out those who identify as transgender and queer. According to a study on transgender centers on campuses, there are many events that relate to trans issues, but instead of being with these communities, the programming created is about the transgender community. Including and fostering the \\"practice and process\\" of inclusion should remain the primary focus rather than a \\"singular point of 'liberation'\\".

He is best known for his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name Steve Corino. He is overall a three-time world champion in major professional wrestling promotions. Corino has held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, the MLW World Heavyweight Championship, and the 1PW World Heavyweight Championship once each, and the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship and the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship twice each. In addition to these titles, he has also held the ROH World Tag Team Championship once, as well as numerous titles on the independent circuit. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1994‚Äì1998)= Corino began wrestling in 1994 and spent four years working on the independent circuit. During this time, he was a part of the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts, a promotion run by Matt and Jeff Hardy. Corino began an anti-hardcore gimmick on the independent circuit, because he felt he would have more chance of getting work if he did not work hardcore matches. He gained experience, working in Puerto Rico for the WWC, working under the ring name Lightning Kid (which had been a gimmick previously used by Sean Waltman) and also made some appearances for the WWF as a jobber. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998‚Äì2001)= Corino with CW Anderson In 1998, Corino debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as a heel manager. He stood out in ECW as a result of his \\"King of Old School\\" gimmick, where he would deride hardcore wrestlers, at one point invading a Limp Bizkit concert and protesting the immoral conduct. In late 1999, Corino took Jack Victory on as a manager, and became an advisor for Tajiri and Rhino. He then began feuding with Dusty Rhodes, who defeated him in a gory Bullrope match at Living Dangerously. At Heat Wave 2000, he lost to Jerry Lynn. Corino went on to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on November 5, 2000 at November to Remember by defeating Justin Credible, Sandman and Champion Jerry Lynn in a Double Jeopardy match; then to successfully defend it at Massacre on 34th Street in December against Jerry Lynn and Justin Credible in a three way dance. Due to repeated failures of ECW paying Corino his salary, he left the company on January 7, 2001, the night he lost the ECW World Title at Guilty as Charged 2001 to Sandman. His friend Dustin Rhodes got him a contract in World Championship Wrestling, but he never got to make an appearance despite being due to debut at the company's third to last PPV Sin. When World Wrestling Entertainment took over WCW in March 2001, they released Corino from his contract. He went on to wrestle for many of the National Wrestling Alliance regional promotions. On April 24, he won the NWA World Heavyweight title. =Independent circuit (2001‚Äì2006)= Corino continued his feud with Rhodes in his Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion as well as Southern Championship Wrestling and was part of the Extreme Horsemen with C.W. Anderson and Barry Windham. He was also part of the Extreme Horsemen in Major League Wrestling with C.W. Anderson, Justin Credible and Simon Diamond. They were briefly managed by the legendary James J. Dillon before MLW folded. Also, Corino went on to win the MLW World Heavyweight Championship before the promotion was folded. In 2004 Corino made a number of appearances for Frontier Wrestling Alliance in the United Kingdom, where he entered a short rivalry with Alex Shane. The feud culminated in the main event match of Hotwired, where Corino defeated Shane with the assistance of then FWA Heavyweight Champion, Doug Williams. As Steve Corino was a major part of ECW towards the end of its run, rumors swirled surrounding Corino possibly signing with World Wrestling Entertainment and returning to his ECW roots as a part of the new version of ECW, but he squashed those rumors in a posting on his LiveJournal.corino: Yellow \\"journalism\\" Instead of signing with WWE, Corino worked in various independent promotions, including Zero-One, Hustle in Japan, Ring of Honor in the United States and both One Pro Wrestling and Celtic Wrestling in the United Kingdom. He was also president of World-1 Fighting Arts, which runs shows in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002, 2003)= Corino also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during its early days. Corino had matches with Low Ki and many other stars before leaving the promotion some time later. =Ring of Honor (2002‚Äì2006)= Responding to a challenge from The Backseat Boyz, Homicide invited anyone in the locker room to be his partner. Steve Corino made his ROH debut and responded to his offer, resulting in the two facing the Backseat Boys later that night. In the course of the match, Corino turned on Homicide after Homicide accidentally hit him, Old School Kicking his partner and leaving the ring, enabling the Backseat Boyz to easily defeat Homicide. Homicide and Corino would then begin a four-year rivalry, with Corino criticizing Homicide's lifestyle and somewhat checkered past. The feud culminated in a match at the One Year Anniversary Show on February 8, 2003 in Queens, New York, New York. Homicide was the hometown favorite, but lost to Corino following interference from The Group (Samoa Joe, Michael Shane, C.W. Anderson and Simply Luscious), Corino's entourage. After the match, Corino applied a cobra clutch to Homicide, while the rest of The Group mocked New York City, instigating a worked riot. Corino and Homicide had a rematch August 16, 2003, at Bitter Friends, Stiffer Enemies which saw Corino defeated. After twenty minutes of fighting which saw both men bleeding and carrying injuries, Homicide trapped Corino in a modified STF, prompting Corino's corner man, Guillotine LeGrande, to throw in the towel, awarding the match to Homicide. In the course of the match, Corino suffered a legitimate ruptured eardrum, and permanently lost most of the hearing in his left ear following a stiff slap to the side of the head from Homicide. Homicide has since stated in a shoot interview that he is not sorry for costing Corino his hearing, claiming Corino had been stiff with him the whole match. Homicide faced Corino for a third time on November 29, 2003, at War of the Wire in a barbed wire match. This time however, Julius Smokes threw in the towel for Homicide after Corino throttled him with a length of barbed wire. Corino offered Homicide a handshake after the match, indicating that he finally respected Homicide, but Homicide refused to shake his hand. On October 14, 2005, at Enter the Dragon, Corino returned to ROH in a tag team match that saw him team with Colt Cabana to defeat Low Ki and Homicide. On December 3 in New York City at Steel Cage Warfare, Homicide lost to Corino in a rematch from their feud of 2003 after Colt Cabana, under a mask, interfered in the match. During the match, Homicide separated his shoulder, but opted not to have surgery. As a result of his injury, Homicide was unable to compete at the following show, Final Battle 2005. He did show up, however, but with the intent on killing Steve Corino. Following Corino's match, Homicide ran down to the ring and attacked him. Colt Cabana ran down to the ring to save Corino, only to have Homicide pour Drano down his throat. He returned to ROH in August 2006 after a long absence, reigniting his feud with Homicide. The feud culminated on November 4 in Philadelphia, at The Bitter End when Homicide beat Corino in a Fight Without Honor. Although the two still hated each other, they shook hands after the match and Corino allowed Homicide to shave his head. =Retirement tour (2007)= After announcing that his retirement would come at the end of 2007, Corino began a retirement tour and traveled to various federations as a part of the tour. On October 6, 2007, Corino captured the B4W North American title in Morganville, New Jersey from then-champion Tommy Thunda.

During early 2010, Corino formed a partnership with Kevin Steen and together the two of them started a feud with Steen's former tag team partner El Generico and Colt Cabana. On April 3, 2010, Corino made his ROH pay-per-view debut at The Big Bang!, where he and Steen were defeated by El Generico and Cabana via disqualification, when Steen used a chair on his former partner. On September 11 at Glory By Honor IX Generico and Cabana defeated Steen and Corino in a Double Chain match, when Cabana forced Corino to tap out. On October 16, 2010, Cabana defeated Corino in an \\"I Quit\\" match to end their feud. Following Steen's departure from Ring of Honor after December's Final Battle 2010, Corino proclaimed himself a changed man and turned babyface. Corino began feuding with Mike Bennett, and the two faced each other at Manhattan Mayhem IV on March 19, with Bennett picking up the victory. On May 21 at Supercard of Honor VI, Corino revealed the returning Jimmy Jacobs as the sponsor, who had helped him change his ways. Kevin Steen returned to ROH on June 26 at Best in the World 2011, seemingly wanting redemption as well. However, after saving Corino from the House of Truth, Steen turned on him and Jacobs, before being dragged out of the arena. On December 23 at Final Battle 2011, with Jimmy Jacobs as the special guest referee in a No Disqualification match, Kevin Steen defeated his former mentor, Corino, to be reinstated in ROH. Corino later returned to ROH on May 12, 2012, when he formed the S.C.U.M. (Suffering, Chaos, Ugliness, and Mayhem) stable with Steen and Jacobs. On September 15 at Death Before Dishonor X: State of Emergency, Corino and Jacobs defeated Charlie Haas and Rhett Titus in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant ROH World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark) on December 16 at Final Battle 2012: Doomsday in a three-way match, which also included the team of Caprice Coleman and Cedric Alexander. On April 6, 2013, Corino became the new leader of S.C.U.M., when the stable turned on Kevin Steen, after he had lost the ROH World Championship. On June 23, S.C.U.M. was forced to disband, after being defeated by Team ROH in a Steel Cage Warfare match. Since the dissolution of S.C.U.M., Corino has been working with ROH as their regular color commentator alongside play-by-play commentator Kevin Kelly and occasionally Nigel McGuinness while simultaneously having a running feud with B.J. Whitmer and The Decade. The rivalry has included Whitmer goading Corino to join The Decade, with Corino refusing, but Whitmer wasn't talking about Steve but his real-life son Colby and successfully recruiting him into The Decade. During his feud, McGuinness warned Corino that he can't attack any ROH employee or he will be suspended. After attacking Whitmer with a roll of quarters, McGuinness suspended and banned him from commentary, but then, he was reinstated as a wrestler and was scheduled to fight Whitmer in a Fight without Honor at Final Battle, but Corino announced that he was gonna have neck surgery and that his career may end. He continued to commentary with a mask under the name of Mr. Wrestling 3. Even he was taking that gimmick, Whitmer was saying that Mr. Wrestling 3 was indeed Steve Corino and was convincing Colby, that Corino replaced him for Corino's new wife and son, and Whitmer continued torturing Colby in front of Corino's eyes. At War of the Worlds, Corino returned as the Steve Corino character, admitting that he didn't want to be the \\"Evil Man\\" anymore, but after Whitmer's deeds, he promised that at the newly reinstated match that will happen at Best in the World 2016, he will do things that he will never apologize for. At Best in the World, Corino faced Whitmer in a Non-Sanctioned Fight without Honor, but he lost after the interference of Kevin Sullivan. After Best in the World, Corino returned to commentating, but during Whitmer's matches, he was continuously berated by Sullivan. At the Final Battle event, Cody, who defeated Jay Lethal, proceeded to cause chaos in the ring and then he pushed Corino. The night at the event, Whitmer said that a \\"brother\\" has to be sacrificed, which was revealed that Corino was about to fight Cody, who berated Corino's actions with Dusty Rhodes. In their match, Corino lost to Cody, which was Corino's last match in ROH. Corino's ROH contract expired on December 31, 2016. =WWE (2016‚Äìpresent)= In November 2016, Corino worked as a guest trainer at the WWE Performance Center. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that he had signed to become a full-time trainer for WWE, starting January 2017. On January 12, 2017, it was confirmed that Corino was now working for WWE. According to Pro Wrestling Torch in September 2017, Corino teaches the advanced class at the WWE Performance Center, the third of four levels of classes.

History  The Jenolan Caves are a tourist attraction that first became popular in the mid and late nineteenth century. The journey to the caves from Sydney was a long one, though, and even after the western railway was completed to Bathurst in 1870, the journey involved a lengthy horse ride from the nearest station at Tarana. In 1884 a New South Wales government party marked out a new horse track from Katoomba across the Coxs River to shorten the journey. The track was constructed to be six feet wide (in order that two loaded drays could pass each other at any point), and was completed at a cost of ¬£2500, although it was not until 1937 that the track became known as the Six Foot Track, by which time it was already close to impassable. The first recorded journey on the track was in 1887 by the NSW Governor, Lord Carrington, and his wife. The journey from start to finish took approximately eight hours and was very popular until motor vehicles gradually took over in the twentieth century, and an alternative route to Jenolan was built. Today the Six Foot Track is one of Australia‚Äôs most iconic and well- known overland trackshttps://www.overnightadventures.com/six-foot-track.  Track description  Starting on the western outskirts of Katoomba at the Explorers tree, the track descends via steep steps through the temperate rainforest of Nellies Glen to the Megalong Valley floor. Here in the valley the track passes the historical site of the abandoned shale mining Megalong Village and continues on through farmland past the Megalong Cemetery (this is just off the track). The track winds along the steep-sided banks of the Coxs River. The river is crossed either via ford or by using a suspension bridge, called Bowtells Swing Bridge, built by 3 Troop, the 'Tunnel Rats' of the 1st Field Squadron of the Royal Australian Engineers in 1991. It was named in honour of CPL Bob Bowtell a former member of 3 Tp. Bob was born in Katoomba and he died in Vietnam. He was one of the famous 'Tunnel Rats' and he died in a tunnel clearance. His children attended the opening of the bridge in 1992. A dedicated campsite is available where most people camp the night before the demanding climb up to Mini-Mini Saddle the next morning and then the descent to Alum Creek. Another challenging uphill climb is then tackled with the rise to the Pluviometer which is situated towards the eastern end of the Black Range ridge. This is followed by a slightly-inclining walk along the ridgeline to the dedicated Black Range Campsite. From here the track crosses then hugs close to Jenolan Road before diverting to the final descent to the limestone caves at Jenolan.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.240-245 The track is best walked in spring or autumn due to the heat and bushfire hazards of summer and the cold nights and rain of winter. The track can be walked in either direction. There is a popular running race, the Six Foot Track Marathon, along the length of the trail every March. In 2009, 849 runners started the race at Explorers Tree. This race has become iconic, one of the premier long distance events in the world and celebrated its 25th anniversary on 8 March 2008. Relevant topographic maps for the track are available from the NSW Department of Lands, maps Katoomba (8930-1S), Hampton (8930-4S) and Jenolan (8930-3N) cover the entirety of the track.http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/blue-mountains- katoomba/six-foot-track.html Or Download and print the full map set on the PDF from wildwalks  Track terrain profile  Here is a terrain profile of the walk (via the swing bridge) Starting from the Katoomba End, Six Foot Track terrain profile  Images  Image:Explorers Tree Katoomba.jpgThe Explorers Tree, Katoomba Image:Six Foot Track Nellies Glen.jpgThe track at Nellies Glen Image:Six Foot Track Megalong Valley.jpgThe track where it passes through the Megalong Valley Image:E9766-Megalong-big-goanna.jpgGoanna climbing a tree near Six Foot Track References *NSW Heritage Walks, G McDougall, Kangaroo Press, 1992  External links  *Self-Guided Six Foot Track Trips With Optional Hiking Equipment Rental *Six Foot Track - maps, videos, photos, tracknotes *Guided tours for the Six Foot Track *Six Foot Track Detailed printable maps and track notes for walking the six foot track *Wall poster for Six Foot Track *Six Foot Track Marathon Website *On Track Accommodation and Support x Category:Hiking and bushwalking tracks in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) ","title":"Six Foot Track"},{"id":"1912755","text":"The Vista Alegre crater is a meteorite crater in Coronel Vivida, Paran√° State, Brazil.

ODI had the following programmes that focus on aspects of international development: * Agricultural Development and Policy * Centre for Aid and Public Expenditure (CAPE) * Climate and Energy * Communications (for dispersal of ODI events and publications) * Development Strategy and Finance *Digital Societies * Growth, Poverty and Inequality * Humanitarian Policy Group * International Economic Development Group * Politics and Governance * Public Finance and Institutions * Research and Policy in Development * Risk and Resilience * Social Development * Social Protection and Social Policy * Water Policy *Gender Equality and Social Inclusion =Event series and publications= ODI hosts regular event series with conferences and panels discussing a wide range of development issues. Speakers include ODI staff, visiting development policymakers, DFID officials and other prominent figures such as Justin Yifu Lin, the former World Bank Chief Economist. ODI has published many books, papers, briefings, and two academic journals, Development Policy Review and Disasters. In November 2013 an ODI report on fossil fuel subsidies and climate was published, followed up by another report about the same topic a year later, which was discussed by BBC, the Guardian and Die Welt. = Fellowship = ODI runs a fellowship scheme, which sends young postgraduate economists of all nationalities to work in the public sectors of developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific on two-year contracts. Since 1963 ODI has sent over 1000 postgraduate economists to work in 40 mostly low-income countries. Participants were initially known as Overseas Development Institute Nuffield Fellows (ODINs) and later titled as ODI Fellows. =Funding= As a registered charity, ODI's income relies on \\"grants and donations from foundations, non-governmental organisations, the private sector, governments, multilateral agencies and academia\\". For its ¬£28,541,000 income (USD 42,811,000 as of January 2015) per its annual report from 2013 to 2014 ending 31 March 2014, ODI provided a list of these \\"major donors\\", which include Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Oxfam, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Research Triangle Institute, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Swiss Federal Government, The Prince's Youth Business International, UN Women, UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, US Agency for International Development, Wiley-Blackwell, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, World Bank.

The majority of his career was spent working for the imperial Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a language officer at the Russian embassy in Munich. As a military officer, he took part in the War of the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. In his later career, he was transferred to the Asian department of the ministry and undertook a tour of Mongolia to collect ancient manuscripts. Schilling is best known for his pioneering work in electrical telegraphy, which he undertook at his own initiative. While in Munich, he worked with Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmerring who was developing an electrochemical telegraph. Schilling developed the first electromagnetic telegraph that was of practical use. Schilling's design was a needle telegraph using magnetised needles suspended by a thread over a current-carrying coil. His design also greatly reduced the number of wires compared to S√∂mmerring's system by the use of binary coding. Tsar Nicholas I planned to install Schilling's telegraph on a link to Kronstadt, but cancelled the project after Schilling died. Other technological interests of Schilling included lithography and remote detonation of explosives. For the latter, he invented a submarine cable, which he later also applied to telegraphy.  Early life  Baron Pavel Lvovitch Schilling von Cannstadt was born in Reval (now Tallinn), Estonia, on 16 April 1786 (N.S.). He was an ethnic German, but a Russian citizen as Estonia was then part of the Russian Empire. His father was L. F. Schilling, commander of the 23rd Nizovsky infantry regiment, and Pavel was the eldest of four children.Yarotsky, p. 709 He was expected to follow a military career like his father, so he was sent to First Cadet Corps at the age of eleven. On graduating as a subaltern, he was posted to a unit commanded by Theodor von Schubert and assigned cartographical surveying duties.Yarotsky, pp. 709‚Äì710  Diplomatic career  Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmerring Family circumstances obliged Schilling to resign his commission in 1803. He then joined the foreign service as a language officer.Yarotsky, p. 710 He was an attach√© to the Russian embassy in Munich from 1809 to 1811.Huurdeman, p. 54 He first became interested in electrical science while he was in Munich through contact with Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmerring who was developing an electrical telegraph.Huurdeman, p. 54 Since his duties as a diplomat were light, he spent much time with S√∂mmerring,Hubbard, p. 11 and brought many Russian dignitaries to see S√∂mmerring's apparatus.Hamel, p. 13 When war threatened between France and Russia, Schilling put his mind to applying his electrical knowledge to military purposes. He devised a water resistant conducting wire that could be laid in wet earth or through rivers. It consisted of a copper wire insulated with a mixture of India-rubber and varnish. Schilling had in mind the military use of telegraphy in the field for this invention. He also thought it would be useful for exploding mines at a distance.Fahie, pp. 308‚Äì309 Schilling became excitable about the latter idea. S√∂mmerring wrote in his diary \\"Schilling is quite childish about his electro-conducting cord.\\"Hamel, p. 21  Napoleonic wars  Schilling, along with all Russian diplomats in Germany, was recalled to St. Petersburg in 1812 as the impending French invasion of Russia loomed.Huurdeman, p. 54 There he continued his work on mine detonation. He used an electric spark across charcoal points (electrodes ending in a sharp point) connected to the end of his cable. He experimentally set off explosions across the Neva River and later, during the occupation of Paris in 1814, across the Seine.Fahie, pp. 308‚Äì309 Much later (after the war) he took the end of an igniter cable into Tsar Nicholas I's tent while camped near St. Petersburg and invited him to touch the wires together. The resulting distant explosion surprised everyone and earned Schilling a round of applause.Hamel, p. 42 Schilling requested a military position and on 6 September 1813 he was posted to the 3rd Sumskoy dragoons with the rank of staff captain.Yarotsky, p. 710Hamel gives the rank as Stabsrittmeister, literally, \\"cavalry chief of staff\\", which is a rank between Rittmeister (equivalent to captain) and Premierleutnant (1st lieutenant). Hamel describes Schilling's regiment as the Secumsky regiment of Hussars, but this may just be a variant translation rather than a different regiment (Hamel, p. 22). He remained in the regiment throughout the War of the Sixth Coalition and saw action at Arcis-sur-Aube (20‚Äì21 February 1814), Fere-Champenoise (25 February), Bar-sur-Aube (27 February), and the final close on Paris (30 March).Hamel, p. 22 He was awarded a military medal and a sword inscribed \\"for valour\\".Yarotsky, p. 710  Return to diplomacy  Schilling returned to his duties in Munich in 1815. He continued to take an interest in electricity, and also in lithography, a new method of printing which he wished to introduce into Russia.Fahie, p. 309 In 1816 he met with Alois Senefelder, the inventor of the lithographic process,Hamel, p. 27 and later founded a large lithographic printing establishment in Russia after he was appointed Director of Lithography at the ministry. Schilling set up an electrical engineering workshop in the Peter and Paul Fortress. He recruited Moritz von Jacobi from Dorpat University to act as his assistant there.Yarotsky, p. 713 In March 1818, Schilling was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Anna.Hamel, p. 31 The government wished to strengthen ties with eastern neighbours. Schilling was transferred to the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of this movement.Yarotsky, p. 710 In 1828 Schilling was made a State Councillor and he became a corresponding member of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences.Artemenko In May 1830,Artemenko he was sent on a two-year mission to Mongolia (then part of China),Huurdeman, p. 54 tasked with searching for rare manuscripts.Artemenko He returned to St. Petersburg in March 1832,Artemenko bringing with him a valuable collection of documents in Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and other languages. These were deposited in the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.Hamel, p. 42 Some of these documents were obtained in exchange for a demonstration of the small telegraph apparatus Schilling had carried with him.Hamel, pp. 42‚Äì43 Back in St. Petersburg, Schilling returned to developing a telegraph. There were plans to put it into service, but Schilling died before these could be completed.Huurdeman, p. 54  Telegraphy  A needle instrument from Schilling's telegraph Schilling first became involved in telegraphy while he was in Munich. He assisted S√∂mmerring with his experiments with an electrochemical telegraph. This form of telegraph uses electricity to cause a chemical reaction at the far end, such as bubbles forming in a glass tube of acid. After returning to St. Petersburg he conducted his own experiments with this type of telegraph. He demonstrated this to Tsar Alexander I in 1812, but Alexander declined to take it up. The Tsar went even further, and forbade all research and publications on electrical telegraphy for fear of the social changes it might bring about.Huurdeman, p. 54 When Schilling learned of Hans Christian √òrsted's discovery in 1820 that electric current could deflect compass needles, he decided to switch investigation into needle telegraphs, that is, telegraphs that used √òrsted's principle. A new Tsar, Nicholas I, ascended the throne in 1825. He was more receptive to new technology than Alexander I.Huurdeman, p. 54 Schilling used from one to six needles in various demonstrations to represent letters of the alphabet or other information. He took a single-needle instrument with him for demonstration purposes on his journey to Mongolia.Fahie, p. 315 When he returned, Schilling used a binary code on his telegraph with multiple needles, inspired by the hexagrams from I Ching which he had become familiar with in Mongolia. These hexagrams are figures used in divination, each of which consist of a figure of six stacked lines. Each line can be solid or broken, two binary states, leading to a total of 64 figures. The six units of the I Ching fitted in perfectly with the six needles he needed to code the Russian alphabet.Artemenko This was the first use of binary coding in telecommunications, predating the Baudot code by several decades.Garratt, p. 273 = 1832 demonstration = On 21 October 1832 (O.S.), Schilling set up a demonstration of his six-needle telegraph between two rooms in his apartment building about 100 metres apart.Sources disagree over whether the 1832 demonstration had six signal needles or one. A one- needle telegraph could replace a six-needle telegraph by sending the digits of the code serially instead of in parallel. Examples of Schilling's six-needle telegraph are in museums in Munich and St. Petersburg, but these are likely not originals. They appear to have been built much later (in the 1880s) for display at exhibitions (Hubbard, p. 13). To get the space to demonstrate a credible distance, he hired the entire floor of the building and ran a mile and a half of wire around the building. The demonstration was so popular that it stayed open until the Christmas break. Notable visitors included Nicholas I (who had already seen an earlier version in April 1830),Hamel, p. 41 Moritz von Jacobi, Alexander von Benckendorff, and Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich. A ten-word message in French was dictated by the Tsar and successfully sent over the apparatus.Some sources (Hubbard, p. 13, Dudley, p. 103) place the demonstration to the Tsar in Berlin. This seems less likely and may be an error. If it was not, there must have been two demonstrations. Alexander von Humboldt, after seeing Schilling's telegraph demonstrated in Berlin, recommended to the Tsar that a telegraph should be built in Russia.Siegert, p. 175 In May 1835 he began a tour of Europe demonstrating a one-needle instrument. He conducted experiments in Vienna with other scientists, including an investigation into the relative merits of rooftop and buried cables. The buried cable was not successful because his thin India rubber and varnish insulation was inadequate. In September he was at a meeting in Bonn where Georg Wilhelm Muncke saw the instrument. Muncke had a copy made for use in his lectures.Fahie, p. 316 In 1835, Schilling demonstrated a five-needle telegraph to the German Physical Society in Frankfurt. By the time Schilling returned to Russia, his telegraph was well known throughout Europe and was frequently discussed in the scientific literature. In September 1836, the British government offered to buy the rights to the telegraph but Schilling declined, wishing to use it to pursue telegraphy in Russia.Fahie, p. 317 = Planned installation = In 1836, Nicholas I created a commission of inquiry to advise on installation of Schilling's telegraph between Kronstadt, an important naval base, and Peterhof Palace.Huurdeman, p. 54 Prince Alexander Menshikov, the Minister of Marine,Yarotsky, p. 713 was appointed president of the commission.Fahie, p. 318 Schilling offered two schemes to the commission. One was to lay a submarine cable across the Gulf of Finland. The wires were to be insulated with varnished silk, bound together, and the whole assembly tarred. The other option was to suspend the wires on poles along the Peterhof Road.Fahie, pp. 317‚Äì318 An experimental line was set up in the Admiralty building running from a room near the grand entrance to Menshikov's study in the northwest corner with telegraph equipment at each end. The line was partly overground and partly submerged in the canal. Menshikov submitted a favourable report and Nicholas I issued a decree in May 1837 ordering the installation of a submarine cable to Kronstadt.Fahie, pp. 318‚Äì319 Schilling took the project as far as ordering the submarine cable from a rope factory in St. Petersburg,Hamel, p. 67 but he died on 6 August (N.S.),Fahie, p. 319Huurdeman gives the date of Schilling's death as 25 July, but this would seem to be a Julian calendar date (Huurdeman, p. 54). and the project was subsequently cancelled.Huurdeman, p. 54 = Single-wire code = Schilling is sometimes credited with being the first to devise a code for a single-wire telegraph, but there is some doubt about how many needles he used and at what dates.Shaffner, pp. 135‚Äì137 It may be that Schilling used a single-needle-only setup on demonstrations around Europe merely for ease of transport, or it may have been a later design inspired by the Gauss and Weber telegraph, in which case he would not have been the first.Vail, p. 155 The code alleged to have been used with this telegraph can be traced to Alfred Vail,Fahie, p. 311 but the variable-length code (like Morse code) given by Vail is merely shown as an example of how it could be used.Vail, p. 156 In any case, two-element signalling alphabets predate any form of electrical telegraphy by some time.Fahie, p. 311 According to Hubbard, it is more likely that Schilling used the same code as used on the six-needle telegraph, but with the bits sent serially instead of in parallel.Hubbard, p. 13 = Automatic recording = Schilling looked into the possibility of automatic recording of telegraph signals, but could not make it work due to the complexity of the device. His electrical engineering successor, Jacobi, succeeded in doing this in 1841 on a telegraph line from the Winter Palace to the General Staff Headquarters.Yarotsky, p. 713  Legacy  kopek postage stamp from the USSR commemorating the 150th anniversary of Pavel Schilling's invention, 1982 The Schilling needle telegraph was never used as such, but it is partly the ancestor of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, a system widely used in the United Kingdom and British Empire in the nineteenth century. Some of the instruments of that system remained in use well into the twentieth century.Huurdeman, pages 67‚Äì69 Schilling's demonstration in Frankfurt was attended by Georg Wilhelm Muncke who subsequently had an exact copy of Schilling's apparatus made. Muncke used this for demonstrations in lectures. One of these lectures was attended by William Fothergill Cooke, who was inspired to build a version of Schilling's telegraph of his own, although he did not realise that the instrument he saw was due to Schilling.Hubbard, pp. 14, 23 He abandoned this method for practical use in favour of electromagnetic clockwork solutions for a while, apparently believing that needle telegraphs always required multiple wires.Shaffner, p. 187 That Schilling's method of suspending the needle by a thread horizontally was not very convenient was also an influence. This changed when he partnered with Charles Wheatstone and the telegraph they then built together was a multiple-needle telegraph, but with a rather more robust mounting based on the galvanometer of Macedonio Melloni.Hubbard, pp. 39, 119 There is no evidence for the claim sometimes advanced that Wheatstone also lectured with a copy of Schilling's telegraph,Hubbard, p. 14 although he certainly knew about it and lectured on its implications.Dudley, p. 103 Schilling's original telegraph of 1832 is currently displayed in the telegraph collection of the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications.Artemenko The instrument was previously on exhibition at the Paris Electrical Exhibition of 1881.Fahie, p. 313 His contributions to electrical telegraphy were named an IEEE Milestone in 2009. The building housing his apartment in St. Petersburg, then known as Ofrosimova's house, but now 7 Marsovue Pole, had a memorial plaque placed in 1886 to mark the centennial of his birth.Yarotsky, p. 709  Notes   References   Bibliography  * Artemenko, Roman, \\"–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –®–∏–ª–ª–∏–Ω–≥ - –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–º–∞–≥–Ω–∏—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∞\\" [\\"Pavel Schilling - inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph\\"], ITWeek, vol. 3, iss. 321, 29 January 2002 (in Russian). * Bermel, Neil, Linguistic Authority, Language Ideology, and Metaphor: The Czech Orthography Wars, Walter de Gruyter, 2008 . * Dudley, Leonard, Mothers of Innovation: How Expanding Social Networks Gave Birth to the Industrial Revolution, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012 . * Fahie, John Joseph, A History of Electric Telegraphy, to the Year 1837, London: E. & F.N.

Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), is a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that interpreted the Takings Clause (\\"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\\") of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court voted 8‚Äì0Justice Robert H. Jackson did not participate, as he had died 10 days before oral arguments were heard. Jackson's successor, John Marshall Harlan II, would not take his seat on the Court until March 1955. to hold that private property could be taken for a public purpose with just compensation. The case laid the foundation for the Court's later important public use cases, Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984) and Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005). Critics of recent occurrences of eminent domain uses trace what they view as property rights violations to this case.  Background  The United States Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act of 1945 to address the vast blighted area found in the District of Columbia. The Act created a commission of five members called the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and granted it the power to redevelop blighted areas and eliminate any \\"blighting factors or causes of blight.\\" The act granted the Agency the power of eminent domain, if necessary, to transfer private property from the original owner to a private entity to serve the public purpose of redevelopment. The Act was not only concerned with clearing slums but also with modernizing the urban environment. The first project under the Act was Project Area B in Southwest Washington, D.C. In 1950, a comprehensive plan for the area was published after surveys indicated that in that area, \\"64.3% of the dwellings were beyond repair, 18.4% needed major repairs, only 17.3% were satisfactory; 57.8% of the dwellings had outside toilets, 60.3% had no baths, 29.6% lacked electricity, 82.2% had no wash basins or laundry tubs, 83.8% lacked central heating.\\" The plan made provisions for the types of dwelling units and provided that \\"at least one-third of them [were] to be low-rent housing with a maximum rental of $17 per room per month.\\" The plan was approved by the Commissioners and the Agency began redevelopment of the area. It was during the beginning stages of this redevelopment that the plaintiffs brought suit to challenge the constitutionality of the taking of their department store, located at 712 Fourth Street, S.W. in Area B. The plaintiffs in the case owned a department store that was not itself blighted but that was scheduled to be taken by eminent domain in order to clear the larger blighted area where it was located. Plaintiffs argued that this property was not slum housing and that it could not be taken for a project under the management of a private agency to be redeveloped for private use simply to make the community more attractive overall. The owners further argued that taking the land under eminent domain and giving it to redevelopers amounted to \\"a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman\\" and did not constitute a public use, thus violating the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Berman's challenge to the constitutionality of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act was heard by a special three-judge panel district court. The key issue addressed was the government's ability and scope to take and transfer private property to private developers as part of a project to clear blight from an entire area. E. Barrett Prettyman, the D.C. Circuit judge who wrote the opinion, found no problem with the government's use of eminent domain to clear blighted structures because it could be seen as the abatement of a public nuisance. However, Judge Prettyman saw the land on which the blighted structures were located as a different matter and as having nothing inherently to do with blight. Such land, he felt, could be taken by eminent domain only if it actually helped to combat the blight that existed on the property. Judge Prettyman ultimately read the Redevelopment Act very narrowly and found that non-blighted property could be taken if the taking could be tied to prevention of blight. He firmly stated, however, that eminent domain could not be used by the government to take private property for the purpose of improving economic or aesthetic conditions of neighborhoods. Therefore, he granted the government's motion to dismiss but also raised the seriousness of using eminent domain to serve broad redevelopment projects.  Decision  The Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of the Planning Commission by arguing that the problem of large-scale blight needed to be addressed by a large-scale integrated redevelopment plan. Justice Douglas wrote, \\"If owner after owner were permitted to resist these redevelopment programs on the ground that his particular property was not being used against the public interest, integrated plans for redevelopment would suffer greatly.\\" As the Planning Commission had made detailed plans and taken extensive surveys of the area in question, the Supreme Court argued for judicial restraint. Douglas wrote, \\"In the present case, the Congress and its authorized agencies have made determinations that take into account a wide variety of values. It is not for us to reappraise them.\\" The Court stated that the Fifth Amendment had nothing to prohibit those who govern the District of Columbia from deciding that the Capital should be \\"beautiful as well as sanitary.\\" As the object of cleaning up the area was said to be within Congress's authority, the Court found a clear right to use eminent domain to accomplish the object. Douglas addressed the issue presented by the landowners of \\"a taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman\\" by saying that a legitimate public purpose had been established by the Congress in creating the entire redevelopment plan: the purpose of the taking was to eliminate slums on an area-wide basis. Specific parcels of land may have been unblighted, but the Court found that their taking was necessary for the functioning of the redevelopment plan as a whole. Justice Douglas expanded the definition of \\"public use\\" to include \\"public purpose\\" based on physical, aesthetic, and monetary benefits; he stated that the purpose of the redevelopment plan was to address the broader blight issues in the area to prevent the neighborhood from reverting to the blighted conditions. The Court ultimately declined to address the specifics of the plan: \\"Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of the land to be taken for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.\\" The judgment of the District Court was affirmed, but the Supreme Court opinion made it clear that Judge Prettyman's narrow reading of the Act was improper.  Legacy  Berman was reexamined in Kelo v. City of New London (2005) in which the Court extended the Berman ruling to allow takings of unblighted private property that were solely for the economic benefit of the condemnor-city. In 1984, the Court had held in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff (1984) that redistribution of land from some private parties to other private parties could pass constitutional muster as a means of rectifying what the state legislature found to be an oligopoly in fee simple land titles. The legislation upheld by the Supreme Court in Berman provided that inasmuch as the taking of land in the project area would displace a large impoverished, slum-dwelling population, in the new [re]development of that area, at least a third of new dwellings would be required to rent for $17 per room per month. However, after the Berman decision came down, that provision was repealed. Similarly, in Hawaii, the taking of the land lessor's interest was supposed to reduce or stabilize housing prices on Oahu. However, after the Midkiff decision, housing prices on Oahu skyrocketed upward, doubling in about five years. Many of the homes in the taking area, notably in the Kahala area, were bought up by Japanese investors who tore them down and replaced them with luxury homes.

Middle Eastern studies (sometimes referred to as Near Eastern studies) is a name given to a number of academic programs associated with the study of the history, culture, politics, economies, and geography of the Middle East, an area that is generally interpreted to cover a range of nations including Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It is considered a form of area studies, taking an overtly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a region. In this sense Middle Eastern studies is a far broader and less traditional field than classical Islamic studies. The subject was historically regarded as part of Oriental studies, which also included East Asian studies and Egyptology and other specialisms in the ancient civilizations of the region; the growth of the field of study in the West is treated at that article. Many academic faculties still cover both areas. Although some academic programs combine Middle Eastern studies with Islamic studies, based on the preponderance of Muslims in the region (with Israel and Lebanon being the only exceptions), others maintain these areas of study as separate disciplines. Contentious issues In 1978 Edward Said, a Palestinian American professor of comparative literature at Columbia University, published his book Orientalism, in which he accused earlier scholars of a \\"subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo- Islamic peoples and their culture\\", claiming the bias amounted to a justification for imperialism. Western academics such as Irwin challenged Said's conclusions,Flemming Rose: Forsvar for en profession [Defence of a profession], interview with Prof. Robert Irwin, Jyllands-Posten, 12 April 2008, section 1, page 17 (accessed via Infomedia.dk and the newspaper's website) however the book became a standard text of literary theory and cultural studies. Following the September 11 attacks, U.S. Middle Eastern studies programs were criticized as inattentive to issues of Islamic terrorism. Israeli-American historian Martin Kramer published a 2001 book, Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America, and Wall Street Journal article claiming that Middle Eastern studies courses were \\"part of the problem, not its remedy.\\" In a Foreign Affairs review of the book, F. Gregory Gause said his analysis was, in part, \\"serious and substantive\\" but \\"far too often his valid points are overshadowed by academic score-settling and major inconsistencies.\\" In 2002, American writer Daniel Pipes established an organisation called Campus Watch to combat what he perceived to be serious problems within the discipline, including \\"analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students\\". He encouraged students to advise the organization of problems at their campuses. In turn critics within the discipline such as John Esposito accused him of \\"McCarthyism\\". Professors denounced by Pipes as \\"left-wing extremists\\" were often harassed with hate speech. Pipes was appointed to the United States Institute of Peace board of directors by George W. Bush, despite protests from the Arab American community. In 2010, foreign policy analyst Mitchell Bard claimed in his 2010 book The Arab Lobby: The Invisible Alliance That Undermines America's Interests in the Middle East that elements of the Arab lobby particularly Saudi Arabia and pro-Palestinian advocates were hijacking the academic field of Middle Eastern studies within several prominent American universities including Georgetown University, Harvard University, and Columbia University. This has involved Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States funding centers and chairs at universities to promote a pro-Arabist agenda. Bard has also accused several prominent Middle Eastern studies academics including John Esposito and Rashid Khalidi of abusing positions by advancing a pro- Palestinian political agenda. In addition, Bard has criticized the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) for adopting a pro-Palestinian standpoint. Bard has also alleged that MESA marginalizes non-Israel-related topics including the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict and the persecution of religious minorities like Christians and ethnic minorities that are non-Arabs such as Jews and Kurds. Finally, Bard has contended that since the September 11 attacks, the Arab lobby working through Middle Eastern Studies university departments have sought to influence pre-university education by tailoring education programs and resources to reflect a pro-Arabist agenda.

It is commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations, but is also used within multivariable calculus when multiplying through by an integrating factor allows an inexact differential to be made into an exact differential (which can then be integrated to give a scalar field). This is especially useful in thermodynamics where temperature becomes the integrating factor that makes entropy an exact differential.  Use  An integrating factor is any expression that a differential equation is multiplied by to facilitate integration. For example, the nonlinear second order equation : \\\\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2} = A y^{2/3} admits \\\\tfrac{d y}{d t} as an integrating factor: : \\\\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2} \\\\frac{d y}{d t} = A y^{2/3} \\\\frac{d y}{d t}. To integrate, note that both sides of the equation may be expressed as derivatives by going backwards with the chain rule: : \\\\frac{d}{d t}\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{d y}{d t}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) = \\\\frac{d}{d t}\\\\left(A \\\\frac 3 5 y^{5/3}\\\\right). Therefore, : \\\\left(\\\\frac{d y}{d t}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{6 A}{5} y^{5/3} + C_0. where C_0 is a constant. This form may be more useful, depending on application. Performing a separation of variables will give : \\\\int_{y(0)}^{y(t)} \\\\frac{d y}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6 A}{5} y^{5/3} + C_0}} = t This is an implicit solution which involves a nonelementary integral. This same method is used to solve the period of a simple pendulum. = Solving first order linear ordinary differential equations = Integrating factors are useful for solving ordinary differential equations that can be expressed in the form : y'+ P(x)y = Q(x) The basic idea is to find some function, say M(x), called the \\"integrating factor\\", which we can multiply through our differential equation in order to bring the left-hand side under a common derivative. For the canonical first- order linear differential equation shown above, the integrating factor is e^{\\\\int P(x) dx}. Note that it is not necessary to include the arbitrary constant in the integral, or absolute values in case the integral of P(x) involves a logarithm. Firstly, we only need one integrating factor to solve the equation, not all possible ones; secondly, such constants and absolute values will cancel out even if included. For absolute values, this can be seen by writing f(x) = f(x) \\\\sgn f(x), where \\\\sgn refers to the sign function, which will be constant on an interval if f(x) is continuous. As \\\\ln f(x) is undefined when f(x) = 0, and a logarithm in the antiderivative only appears when the original function involved a logarithm or a reciprocal (neither of which are defined for 0), such an interval will be the interval of validity of our solution. To derive this, let M(x) be the integrating factor of a first order linear differential equation such that multiplication by M(x) transforms a partial derivative into a total derivative, then: \\\\begin{align} (1)\\\\qquad {} & M(x)\\\\underset{\\\\text{partial derivative}}{(\\\\underbrace{y'+P(x)y})} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (2)\\\\qquad {} & M(x)y'+M(x)P(x)y \\\\\\\\\\\\ (3)\\\\qquad {} & \\\\underset{\\\\text{total derivative}}{\\\\underbrace{M(x)y'+M'(x)y}} \\\\end{align} Going from step 2 to step 3 requires that M(x)P(x)=M'(x), which is a separable differential equation, whose solution yields M(x) in terms of P(x): \\\\begin{align} (4) \\\\qquad & M(x)P(x)=M'(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (5) \\\\qquad & P(x)=\\\\frac{M'(x)}{M(x)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (6) \\\\qquad & \\\\int P(x) dx=\\\\ln M(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (7) \\\\qquad & e^{\\\\int P(x) dx}=M(x) \\\\end{align} To verify, multiplying by M(x) gives :y' M(x) + P(x) y M(x) = Q(x)M(x) By applying the product rule in reverse, we see that the left-hand side can be expressed as a single derivative in x :y' M(x) + P(x) y M(x) = y' M(x) + y M'(x) = \\\\frac{d}{dx}(y M(x)) We use this fact to simplify our expression to :\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(y M(x)\\\\right) = Q(x) M(x) Integrating both sides with respect to x :y e^{\\\\int P(x) dx} = \\\\int Q(x) e^{\\\\int P(x) dx} dx + C where C is a constant. Moving the exponential to the right-hand side the general solution to Ordinary Differential Equation is: :y = e^{- \\\\int P(x) dx} \\\\int Q(x) e^{\\\\int P(x) dx} dx + Ce^{- \\\\int P(x) dx} In the case of a homogeneous differential equation, Q(x) = 0 and general solution to Ordinary Differential Equation is: : y = Ce^{- \\\\int P(x) dx}. for example, consider the differential equation :y'-\\\\frac{2y}{x} = 0. We can see that in this case P(x) = \\\\frac{-2}{x} :M(x)=e^{\\\\int_1^x P(x) dx} :M(x)=e^{\\\\int_1^x \\\\frac{-2}{x}\\\\,dx} = e^{-2 \\\\ln x} = {(e^{\\\\ln x})}^{-2} = x^{-2} :M(x)=\\\\frac{1}{x^2}. Multiplying both sides by M(x) we obtain :\\\\frac{y'}{x^2} - \\\\frac{2y}{x^3} = 0 The above equation can be rewritten as :\\\\frac{d (x^{-2}y)}{dx} = 0 By integrating both sides with respect to x we obtain : x^{-2}y = C or : y = Cx^2 The same result may be achieved using the following approach :\\\\frac{y'}{x^2} - \\\\frac{2y}{x^3} = 0 :\\\\frac{y'x^3 - 2x^2y}{x^5} = 0 :\\\\frac{x(y'x^2 - 2xy)}{x^5} = 0 :\\\\frac{y'x^2 - 2xy}{x^4} = 0. Reversing the quotient rule gives :\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x^2}\\\\right)' = 0 or :\\\\frac{y}{x^2} = C, or :y = Cx^2. where C is a constant. = Solving second order linear ordinary differential equations = The method of integrating factors for first order equations can be naturally extended to second order equations as well. The main goal in solving first order equations was to find an integrating factor M(x) such that multiplying y'+p(x)y=h(x) by it would yield (M(x)y)'=M(x)h(x), after which subsequent integration and division by M(x) would yield y. For second order linear differential equations, if we want M(x)=e^{\\\\int p(x)dx} to work as an integrating factor, then (M(x)y)=M(x)(y+2p(x)y'+(p(x)^2+p'(x))y)=M(x)h(x) This implies that a second order equation must be exactly in the form y+2p(x)y'+(p(x)^2+p'(x))y=h(x) for the integrating factor to be usable.  Example 1  For example, the differential equation y+2xy'+(x^2+1)y=0 can be solved exactly with integrating factors. The appropriate p(x)can be deduced by examining the y' term. In this case, 2p(x)=2x, so p(x)=x. After examining the y term, we see that we do in fact have p(x)^2+p'(x)=x^2+1, so we will multiply all terms by the integrating factor e^{\\\\int xdx}=e^{x^2/2}. This gives us e^{x^2/2}y+2e^{x^2/2}p(x)y'+e^{x^2/2}(p(x)^2+p'(x))y=0 which can be rearranged to give (e^{x^2/2}y)=0 Integrating twice yields e^{x^2/2}y=c_1x+c_2 Dividing by the integrating factor gives: y=\\\\frac{c_1x+c_2}{e^{x^2/2}} Example 2 A slightly less obvious application of second order integrating factors involves the following differential equation: y+2\\\\cot(x)y'-y=1 At first glance, this is clearly not in the form needed for second order integrating factors. We have a 2p(x) term in front of y' but no p(x)^2+p'(x) in front of y. However, p(x)^2+p'(x)=\\\\cot^2(x)-\\\\csc^2(x) and from the Pythagorean identity relating cotangent and cosecant, \\\\cot^2(x)-\\\\csc^2(x)=-1 so we actually do have the required term in front of y and can use integrating factors. e^{\\\\int \\\\cot(x)dx}=e^{\\\\ln(\\\\sin(x))}=\\\\sin(x) Multiplying each term by \\\\sin(x) gives \\\\sin(x)y+2\\\\cot(x)\\\\sin(x)y'-\\\\sin(x)y=\\\\sin(x) which rearranged is (\\\\sin(x)y)=\\\\sin(x) Integrating twice gives \\\\sin(x)y=-\\\\sin(x)+c_1x+c_2 Finally, dividing by the integrating factor gives y=c_1x\\\\csc(x)+c_2\\\\csc(x)-1 = Solving nth order linear differential equations = Integrating factors can be extended to any order, though the form of the equation needed to apply them gets more and more specific as order increases, making them less useful for orders 3 and above. The general idea is to differentiate the function M(x)y n times for an nth order differential equation and combine like terms. This will yield an equation in the form M(x)F(y,y',y,...y^{(n)}) If an nth order equation matches the form F(y,y',y,...y^{(n)}) that is gotten after differentiating n times, one can multiply all terms by the integrating factor and integrate h(x)M(x) n times, dividing by the integrating factor on both sides to achieve the final result.  Example  A third order usage of integrating factors gives (M(x)y)=M(x)(y+3p(x)y+(3p(x)^2+3p'(x))y'+(p(x)^3+3p(x)p'(x)+p(x))y thus requiring our equation to be in the form y+3p(x)y+(3p(x)^2+3p'(x))y'+(p(x)^3+3p(x)p'(x)+p(x))y=h(x) For example in the differential equation y'+3x^2y+(3x^4+6x)y'+(x^6+6x^3+2)y=0we have p(x)=x^2, so our integrating factor is e^{x^3/3}. Rearranging gives (e^{x^3/3}y)=0 Integrating thrice and dividing by the integrating factor yields y=\\\\frac{c_1x^2+c_2x+c_3}{e^{x^3/3}} See also * Variation of parameters * Differential equations * Product rule * Quotient rule * Exact differential * Matrix exponential External links * .

He has also received a number of awards including: City-University Research Award, City of Davis; Research Award, California Alliance for the Mentally Ill; Career Research Award, Environmental Design Research Association; Kurt Lewin Award, Division 9 APA; Fulbright Award to Estonia, USSR; President-Elect 1998‚Äì1999, President 1999‚Äì2000, APA Div. 34, Doctorem Honoris Causa, Tallinn Pedagogical University. Thought Sommer was influenced by his studies on environmental psychology with Dr. Humphry Osmond, a psychiatrist who researched hallucinogens. Osmond coined the term psychedelic and also worked in mental hospitals researching social environments and how they affect recovery.In Memoriam: Humphry Osmond. \\"Journal of Environmental Psychology.\\" Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 257-258 Some scholars see Environmental Psychology as strictly a sub-discipline of Psychology or Social Psychology; others see it as an entirely interdisciplinary study. Sommer views Environmental Psychology as both a sub-discipline within the behavioral sciences as well as an interdisciplinary study that involves a variety of disciplines and professions.The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Psychology. Rom Harr√©, Roger Lamb His view of the discipline is reflected in his writing style; he communicates his ideas without technical, psychological jargon. Though his book, Personal Space, was not specifically written for people outside the field of Environmental Psychology, it is highly readable and thus, accessible to those designers or architects who may actually have the ability to influence building design.Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design Author: Robert Sommer.

Accessed: 06/11/2011 Works On Personal Space Sommer makes the distinction between personal space and territory: \\"The concepts of 'personal space' can be distinguished from that of 'territory' in several ways. The most important difference is that personal space is carried around while territory is relatively stationary. The animal or man will usually mark the boundaries of his territory so that they are visible to others, but the boundaries of personal space are invisible. Personal space has the body as its center, while territory does not. Often the center of territory is the home of the animal or man. Animals will usually fight to maintain dominion over their territory but will withdraw if others intrude into their personal space.\\"Studies in Personal Space. Author: Robert Sommer.

Accessed: 11/13/2011 In his best known book Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design, first published in 1969, Sommer argues that buildings should be built first for function (their usefulness to the user), not form (how they look). The book is divided into two sections: the first section is theoretical, and the second section concerns methods and their applications. In addition to this book, Sommer has written many articles on personal space as well. On Learning And The Classroom Another theme in Sommer's research is the structure of the classroom and how it affects learning. As a high school student, Sommer himself experienced the difficulty of learning in a classroom where he was unable to see the blackboard due to the poor design of the room. He writes that he struggled in the class until, later in the semester, it moved to a new room where he got a front row seat. There, he could see the blackboard and his \\"grades improved markedly\\".Personal Space: The Behavioral Basis of Design [page 101] Author: Robert Sommer (1969) Sommer devotes a chapter to the effect of classroom structure on learning in his book Personal Space, and has also written many journal articles on the topic as well.\\"Classroom Layout\\" Author: Robert Sommer Theory Into Practice Vol. 16, No. 3, Nonverbal (Jun. 1977), pp. 174-175 Publisher: Taylor & Francis, Ltd.

First, the \\"open classroom\\", which he describes as being a \\"more informally arranged and less rigidly structured space\\", and \\"open education\\", a loosening of the current social hierarchy in education where teachers are strictly the sources of knowledge and students only learners. Sommer states that though the addition of \\"open classrooms\\" cannot increase student participation without there also being an environment of \\"open education\\", no shift in hierarchy is likely without a change in the construction or arrangement of the classroom. The Soft Classroom is an article written by Sommer and Olsen describing a study they conducted on the impact of classroom design on learning. It describes the difference in student participation observed in two differently arranged classrooms.A Tale Of Two Classrooms Author: Nancy Van Note Chism Prison Architecture Robert worked on a federal task force consulting for prisons, he studied their built environment and the relation to psychology. His aim was to apply architectural strategies he had used in mental health facilities to the prison setting. Roberts primary concern throughout his research was whether ‚Äòhard architecture‚Äô instills any sort of reform on the individual, or whether it merely perpetuates the idea of punishment. 'Tight Spaces: Hard Architecture and How to Humanize It Author: Robert Sommer, talks about his observations into the soulless architecture of these institutions, and the dehumanizing nature of a prison. Robert faced a difficulty in obtaining reliable data while interviewing in prisons. In one institution he was not allowed to talk to the guards, and was told that interviewing prisoners would violate their privacy. While in another prison, he was barred from interviewing the guards themselves.

Sommer's work has been called \\"valuable for drawing attention to the proliferation of a noncommercial, popular art form in the U.S.A.\\", however there are also some criticisms of the book. Wayne Enstice, in his review of Street Art noted \\"A serious deficiency of his book is the abrasive way he chooses to treat the question\\"...\\"Do Social imperatives demand redefinition of the role of artists?\\" He complains that \\"Readers are asked to measure the accomplishments of community motivated artists against an antagonistic and oversimplified estimation of studio artists...\\". Enstice also dislikes Sommer's division between text and art, saying that it is \\"inappropriate\\".

The Mark 32 has been the standard anti-submarine torpedo launching system aboard United States Navy surface vessels since its introduction in 1960, and is in use aboard the warships of several other navies. Most versions (referred to as modifications or mods) are triple-tube sets that can be rotated or trained to face a target. The exception is the Mod 9 sets, which only have two tubes and are fixed in position. The Mark 32 can fire torpedoes of the Mark 44, Mark 46, Mark 50 (from the Mod 17 tubes onwards), and Mark 54 designs, and can be modified to use other torpedoes (such as the MU90 Impact aboard Royal Australian Navy frigates, or Royal Navy units using Sting Ray torpedoes). The tubes are designed to be fired remotely, but manual firing controls are fitted as a backup to all but the s Mod 15 sets, as all aspects of the tubes' operation are controlled remotely. The launch is powered by compressed air in a rear flask, which also doubles as each tube's breech, and the torpedoes are fire-and-forget weapons. The launcher can be made from fibreglass, or with a fibreglass liner encased in metal. The tubes were designed to be weatherproof and capable of storing torpedoes for long periods, but this is only practical with regular maintenance.

The palm is believed to have originated in the Philippines, but is widespread in cultivation and is considered naturalized in southern China (Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan), Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean, and also in the West Indies.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesJones, D.

A monograph of the betel nut palms (Areca: Arecaceae) of East Malesia. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 168: 147-173. Common names in English include areca palm, areca nut palm, betel palm, Indian nut, Pinang palm. In English this palm is called the betel tree because its fruit, the areca nut, is often chewed along with the betel leaf, a leaf from a vine of the family Piperaceae. Areca is derived from a local name from the Malabar Coast of India, and catechu is from another Malay name for this palm, caccu. Growth Areca catechu is a medium-sized palm tree, growing straight to tall, with a trunk in diameter. The leaves are long, pinnate, with numerous, crowded leaflets. Characteristics 19th century drawing of Areca catechu Areca catechu is grown for its commercially important seed crop, the areca nut. The cities of Tanjung Pinang, Pangkal Pinang in Indonesia, the Indonesian province of Jambi (jambi or jambe is areca in Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and Old Malay), Penang Island, off the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Fua Mulaku in the Maldives, Guwahati in Assam, and coastal areas of Kerala and Karnataka in India, are some of the places named after a local name for areca nut. Actually, there are numerous city and areal names in Indonesia and Malaysia using the words pinang or jambe. This shows how important areca nut is in the Austronesian civilization, especially in the modern day Indonesia or Malaysia. =Chemical composition= The seed contains alkaloids such as arecaidine and arecoline, which, when chewed, are intoxicating and slightly addictive. Areca palms are grown in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other Asian countries for their seeds. The seed also contains condensed tannins (procyanidins) called arecatannins which are carcinogenic. Uses Intensive farming of Areca catechu at a spice plantation in Curti, Goa. The areca nut is also popular for chewing throughout some Asian countries, such as China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, and India and the Pacific Islands, notably Papua New Guinea, where it is very popular. Chewing areca nut is quite popular among working classes in Taiwan. The nut itself can be addictive and has direct link to oral cancers. Areca nuts in Taiwan will usually contain artificial additives such as limestone powder. The extract of Areca catechu may be addictive. The areca palm is also used as an interior landscaping species. It is often used in large indoor areas such as malls and hotels. It will not fruit or reach full size if grown in this way. Indoors, it is a slow growing, low water, high light plant that is sensitive to spider mites and occasionally mealybugs. In India the dry, fallen leaves are collected and hot-pressed into disposable palm leaf plates and bowls.Palm Leaf Plates on the website TheWholeLeafCo.dom; viewed in September 2016  Gallery  Image:Areca_catechu_Forest.JPGAn Areca catechu plantation in Taiwan Image:Palm I IMG 2108.jpgAreca palm at Kolkata, West Bengal, India Image:Palm I IMG 2081.jpgAreca palm at Kolkata, West Bengal, India Image:Areca catechu nuts at Kadavoor.jpgAreca palm fruit at Kerala, India Image:Betel_nuts3.jpgAreca nuts from India Image:Areca catechu Blanco2.350.pngFlora de Filipinas Image:Areca farm.jpgAreca catechu farm in Kerala, India File:BuahPinangMuda.jpgYoung \\"betel\\" nuts in Malaysia File:Flag of Penang (Malaysia).svgAreca nut at Penang's flag File:‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ø.jpgAreca catechu of Bangladesh File:Hat palathoppi.jpgHat palathoppi (Outer view) made of the leaf of Areca catechu in Kerala File:Hat palathoppi kerala.jpgHat_ palathoppi (inner view) made of the leaf of Areca catechu in Kerala References  External links  * Plant Cultures: Betelnut botany and history * Areca catechu List of Chemicals (Dr. Duke's) * Names in different Languages catechu Category:Tropical fruit Category:Fruits originating in Asia Category:Flora of the Philippines Category:Medicinal plants of Asia Category:Garden plants of Asia Category:House plants Category:Ornamental trees Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Poisonous plants ","title":"Areca catechu"},{"id":"1912916","text":"Kendra Todd (born April 6, 1978) is a real estate broker in Seattle, Washington.

Prior to her career as a real estate broker, Todd launched a magazine called Capture Life Magazine featuring southern Florida lifestyle, which won the Florida Magazine Association Award for design. In December, 2012, she married conservative radio host Jason Mattera. Performance on The Apprentice Although Todd was one of the last candidates to become a project manager, she gave a very solid performance in this field, ending the show with a record of 3-0. She used focus groups to pinpoint what potential customers would respond to, and also gave everyone credit where credit was due. Todd was never sent to the boardroom, and was never traded to the competing team. She remained on Team Magna for the entire duration of the show. And Todd had the longest winning streak in her season, with nine wins on Team Magna, starting in Week 6 until the interviews portion of the show took place.Wikipedia: The Apprentice Season 3, Episodes On May 19, 2005 Trump hired Todd.

Its members ruled over more than 200 million people in the British Raj. They were ultimately responsible for overseeing all government activity in the 250 districts that comprised British India. They were appointed under Section XXXII(32) of the Government of India Act 1858, enacted by the British Parliament.Blunt, (1937) The ICS was headed by the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British cabinet. At first almost all the top thousand members of the ICS, known as \\"Civilians\\", were British, and had been educated in the \\"best\\" British schools. By 1905, five per cent were from Bengal. In 1947 there were 322 Indians and 688 British members; most of the latter left at the time of partition and independence.Surjit Mansingh, The A to Z of India (2010), pp 288‚Äì90 Until the 1930s the Indians in the service were very few and not a single Indian was allowed to occupy a high-ranked post. British historian Martin Wainwright notes that by the mid-1880s, \\"the basis of racial discrimination in the sub-continent had solidified\\". At the time of the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the outgoing Government of India's ICS was divided between India and Pakistan. Although these are now organised differently, the contemporary Civil Services of India, the Central Superior Services of Pakistan, Bangladesh Civil Service and Myanmar Civil Service are all descended from the old Indian Civil Service. Historians often rate the ICS, together with the railway system, the legal system, and the Indian Army, as among the most important legacies of British rule in India.Ramesh Kumar Arora and Rajni Goyal, Indian public administration: institutions and issues (1995) p. 42; Ranbir Vohra, The making of India: a historical survey (2001) p 185 Civil service =Origins and history= From 1858, after the demise of the East India Company's rule in India, the British civil service took on its administrative responsibilities. The change in governance came about due to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which came close to toppling British rule in the country. Entry and setting Up to 1853, the Directors of the British East India Company made appointments of covenanted civil servants by nominations. This nomination system was abolished by the British Parliament in 1853 and it was decided that the induction would be through competitive examinations of all British subjects, without distinction of race. The examination for admission to the service was first held only in London in the month of August of each year. All candidate also had to pass a compulsory horse-riding test. The competitive examination for entry to the civil service was combined for the Diplomatic, the Home, the Indian, and the Colonial Services. Candidates had to be aged between 18 and 23 for appearing in the exam. The total marks possible in the examination were 1,900 and one could get up to three chances for entry. Successful candidates underwent one or two years probation in the United Kingdom, according to whether they had taken the London or the Indian examination. This period was spent at the University of Oxford (Indian Institute), the University of Cambridge, colleges in the University of London (including School of Oriental Studies) or Trinity College Dublin, where a candidate studied the law and institutions of India, including criminal law and the law of evidence, which together gave knowledge of the revenue system, as well as reading Indian history and learning the language of the province to which they had been assigned. The Early Nationalists, also known as the Moderates, worked for several implementation of various social reforms such as the appointment of a Public Service Commission and a resolution of the House of Commons (1893) allowing for simultaneous examination for the Indian Civil Service in London and India. By 1920, there were five methods of entry into the higher civil service: firstly, the open competitive examinations in London; secondly, separate competitive examinations in India; thirdly, nomination in India to satisfy provincial and communal representation; fourthly, promotion from the Provincial Civil Service and lastly, appointments from the bar (one-fourth of the posts in the ICS were to be filled from the bar).Ramesh Kumar Arora and Rajni Goyal, Indian public administration: Institutions and Issues (1995) p 43 =Uniform and dressing= Queen Victoria had suggested that the civil servants in India should have an official dress uniform, as did their counterparts in the Colonial Service. However, the Council of India decided that prescribing a dress uniform would be an undue expense for their officials. Although no uniform was prescribed for the Indian Civil Service until the early twentieth century. The only civilians allowed a dress uniform by regulations were those who had distinct duties of a political kind to perform, and who are thereby brought into frequent and direct personal intercourse with native princes. This uniform included a blue coat with gold embroidery, a black velvet lining, collar and cuffs, blue cloth trousers with gold and lace two inches wide, a beaver cocked hat with black silk cockade and ostrich feathers, and a sword. =Nature and role= The civil services were divided into two categories - covenanted and uncovenanted. The covenanted civil service consisted of British civil servants occupying the higher posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians at the lower rung of the administration.Meghna Sabharwal, Evan M. Berman \\"Public Administration in South Asia: India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan (Public Administration and Public Policy)\\" (2013) Salary and posts After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the pay scales were drawn up. Assistant Commissioners started out in their early twenties on around ¬£300 a year. The governorship of a British province was the highest post an ICS officer could aspire for. The Governors at the top of the pyramid got ¬£6,000 and allowances. All ICS officers retired on the same pension ¬£1,000. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the imbalance in salaries and emoluments was so great that 8,000 British officers earned ¬£13,930,554, while 130,000 Indians in government service were collectively paid a total of ¬£3,284,163. They served a minimum of twenty five and a maximum of thirty five years service. ICS officers served as political officers in the Indian Political Department and also were given fifty percent judgeship in the state high court and rest were generally elevated from the high court bar. The tenure of ICS officers serving as judges of the high court and Supreme Court was determined by the retirement age fixed for judges. =Ranks/Posts of the Indian (Imperial) Civil Service= * Central Government ** Secretary to Government of India ** Joint Secretary to Government of India ** Deputy Secretary ** Additional Deputy Secretary ** Under Secretary ** Assistant Secretary to Government of India * Courts ** Judge of State High Court ** District Judge * State Government ** Chief Secretary (British Empire) ** Secretary to State Government ** Divisional Commissioner ** Deputy Commissioner / District Collector Changes after 1912 With the passing of the Government of India Act 1909, the Imperial Services headed by the Secretary of State for India, were split into two ‚Äì All India Services and Central Services. Prior to the First World War, 95% of ICS officers were Europeans; after the war, the British government faced growing difficulties in recruiting British candidates to the service. Fewer and fewer young men in Britain were interested in joining, mainly due to the decreased levels of compensation to be had compared to other careers. Confronted with numerous vacancies, the government resorted to direct appointments; between 1915 and 1924, 80% of new British ICS candidates entered the service in this way. During the same period, 44% of new appointments to the ICS were filled by Indians. In 1922, Indian candidates were permitted to sit the ICS examinations in Delhi; in 1924, the Lee Commission, chaired by Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham (which eventually led to the foundation of the Federal Public Service Commission and Provincial Public Service Commission under the Government of India Act 1935) made several recommendations: ICS officers should receive increased and more comprehensive levels of compensation, future batches of ICS officers should be composed of 40% Europeans and 40% Indians, with the remaining 20% of appointments to be filled by direct promotion of Indians from the Provincial Civil Services (PCS) and the examinations in Delhi and London were to produce an equal number of ICS probationers. In addition, under-representation of candidates from Indian minority groups (Muslims, Burmese and so on) would be corrected by direct appointments of qualified candidates from those groups, while British candidates would continue to have priority over Indians for ICS appointments. While initially successful, the expansion of the Indian independence movement from the late 1920s resulted in a hardening of Indian attitudes against European officers, and furthered distrust of Indian ICS appointments amongst Indians. This resulted in a declining recruitment base in terms of quality and quantity.David C. Potter, \\"Manpower Shortage and the End of Colonialism: The Case of Indian Civil Service,\\" Modern Asian Studies, (Jan 1973) 7#1 pp 47‚Äì73 The All India and class 1 Central Services were designated as Central Superior Services as early as 1924. From 1924 to 1934, Administration in India consisted of \\"ten\\" All India Services and five central departments, all under the control of Secretary of State for India, and 3 central departments under joint Provincial and Imperial Control. From the 1935 Government of India act to Independence The finances of India under British rule depended largely on land taxes, and these became problematic in the 1930s. Epstein argues that after 1919 it became harder and harder to collect the land revenue. The suppression of civil disobedience by the British after 1934 temporarily increased the power of the revenue agents, but after 1937 they were forced by the new Congress-controlled provincial governments to hand back confiscated land. The outbreak of the Second World War strengthened them again, but in the face of the Quit India movement the revenue collectors had to rely on military force, and by 1946‚Äì47 direct British control was rapidly disappearing in much of the countryside.Simon Epstein, 'District Officers in Decline: The Erosion of British Authority in the Bombay Countryside, 1919 to 1947' in Modern Asian Studies, (May 1982) 16#3, pp 493‚Äì518 The outbreak of war in 1939 had immediate consequences for recruitment to the ICS. The examinations in London were suspended after that year's batch (12 British and eight Indian examinees) had qualified. In 1940 and 1941, 12 and four British candidates, respectively, were nominated to the ICS; the following year, the final London-nominated ICS candidates, both of whom were Indian, entered the service. Examinations continued to be held in Delhi for Indian candidates until 1943, when the last seven ICS officers (seven examinees, two nominated) joined. By this time, the British government felt it could no longer rely unambiguously on the complete loyalty of its Indian officers. During the period of the Interim Government of India (1946-1947), a few British candidates were given emergency appointments in the ICS, though ultimately none of them ever served in India. Independence of India At the time of the partition of India and departure of the British, in 1947, the Indian Civil Service was divided between the new Dominions of India and Pakistan. The part which went to India was named the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), while the part that went to Pakistan was named the \\"Civil Service of Pakistan\\" (CSP). In 1947, there were 980 ICS officers. 468 were Europeans, 352 Hindus, 101 Muslims, two depressed classes/Scheduled Castes, five domiciled Europeans and Anglo-Indians, 25 Indian Christians, 13 Parsis, 10 Sikhs and four other communities. Most European officers left India at Partition, while many Hindus and Muslims went to India and Pakistan respectively. This sudden loss of officer cadre caused major challenges in administering the nascent states. Despite offers from the new Indian and Pakistani governments, virtually all of the European former ICS officers left following partition, with the majority of those who did not opt for retirement continuing their careers either in the British Home Civil Service or in another British colonial civil service. A few British ex-ICS officers stayed on over the ensuing quarter-century, notably those who had selected the \\"judicial side\\" of the ICS. The last British former ICS officer from the \\"judicial side\\" still serving in the subcontinent, Justice Donald Falshaw (ICS 1928), retired as Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court (now the Punjab and Haryana High Court) in May 1966, receiving a knighthood in the British 1967 New Year Honours upon his return to Britain. J. P. L. Gwynn (ICS 1939), the last former ICS officer holding British nationality and the last to serve in an executive capacity under the Indian government, ended his Indian service in 1968 as Second Member of the Board of Revenue, but continued to serve in the British Home Civil Service until his final retirement in 1976. Justice William Broome (ICS 1932), a district and sessions judge at the time of Independence in 1947, remained in Indian government service as a judge. Having married an Indian, Swarup Kumari Gaur, in 1937, with whom he raised a family, he eventually renounced his British citizenship in 1958 and became an Indian citizen with the personal intervention of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, himself a former barrister who regarded Broome as a distinguished jurist and as \\"much as Indian as anybody can be who is not born in India\\". Upon his retirement on 18 March 1972 from the Allahabad High Court as its seniormost puisne judge, Broome was the last former ICS officer of European origin serving in India. Nirmal Kumar Mukarji (ICS 1943), a member of the final batch recruited to the ICS and who retired as Cabinet Secretary in April 1980, was the last Indian administrative officer who had originally joined as an ICS. The last former ICS officer to retire, Aftab Ghulam Nabi Kazi (also a member of the final ICS batch of 1943), retired as Chairman of the Pakistan Board of Investment in 1994. V. K. Rao (born 1914; ICS 1937), the last living ICS officer to have joined the service in a regular pre-war intake, died in 2018. He was a retired Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh and was the oldest former ICS officer on record at the time of his death. As of 2020, only one ICS officer remains alive- V.M.M. Nair (ICS 1942), who transferred to the Indian Political Service in 1946 and then to the Indian Foreign Service after Independence. Support and criticism Dewey has commented that \\"in their heyday they [Indian Civil Service officers] were mostly run by Englishmen with a few notable sons of Hindus and even a fewer Muslims were the most powerful officials in the Empire, if not the world. A tiny cadre, a little over a thousand strong, ruled more than 300 million Indians. Each Civilian had an average 300,000 subjects, and each Civilian penetrated every corner of his subjects' lives, because the Indian Civil Service directed all the activities of the Anglo-Indian state.\\" The ICS had responsibility for maintaining law and order, and often were at loggerheads with the independence activists during the Indian independence movement. Jawaharlal Nehru often ridiculed the ICS for its support of British policies. He noted that someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, \\"with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in this country, as neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service\\".Jawaharlal Nehru, Glimpses of world history: being further letters to his daughter (Lindsay Drummond Ltd., 1949), p. 94 As Prime Minister, Nehru retained the organisation and its top people, albeit with a change of title to the \\"Indian Administrative Service\\". It continued its main roles. Nehru appointed long- time ICS officials Chintaman Deshmukh as his Finance Minister, and K. P. S. Menon as his Foreign Minister. Sardar Patel appreciated their role in keeping India united after Partition, and noted in Parliament that without them, the country would have collapsed.

It was directed by Akira Kitamura, with Nobuyuki Matsushima as lead programmer, and is the first game of the Mega Man franchise and the original video game series. Mega Man was produced by a small team specifically for the home console market, a first for Capcom, who previously focused on arcade titles. The game begins the struggle of the humanoid robot and player- character Mega Man against the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six Robot Masters under his control. Mega Mans nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a \\"Robot Master\\" boss battle that awards the player-character a unique weapon. Part of the strategy of the game consists of choosing the order to tackle the stages in order to earn the weapons that will be most useful for future stages. Critics praised Mega Man for its overall design, though the game was not a commercial success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs. The game has since been included in game compilations, rereleased on mobile phones, and become a part of console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled Mega Man Powered Up in 2006. Plot In the year 20XX, robots developed to assist mankind are commonplace thanks to the efforts of renowned robot designer Dr. Light. However, one day these robots go out of control and start attacking the populace, among them six advanced humanoid robots made by Dr. Light for industrial purposes: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. He realizes the culprit is his old rival Dr. Wily (who plots to take over the world), but is unsure of what to do. His helper robot Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man.Rockman manual, December 17, 1987, Capcom Entertainment, Inc. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (which happens to be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family. The initial Western release of the game, while keeping the basic plot the same, significantly changed some details from the original Japanese manual. In this version, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily (here Light's assistant turned disloyal) co-create the humanoid robot Mega Man alongside the six advanced robots, each of whom were designed for the benefit of Monsteropolis's citizens (no such place existed in the original plot). Dr. Wily grows disloyal of his partner and reprograms these six robots to aid himself in taking control of the world, creating the seven empires of Monsteropolis. Dr. Light sends Mega Man to destroy his fellow creations and stop Dr. Wily. Gameplay alt=A square video game screenshot that depicts a blue character sprite firing a shot toward a vertical brick wall. Other sprites surround the character and a score are visible at the top of the screenshot. Mega Man consists of six side- scrolling platformer levels freely chosen by the player. In each level, the player-character, Mega Man, fights through various enemies and obstacles before facing a \\"Robot Master\\" boss at the level's end. Upon defeating the boss, the player assimilates the Robot Master's signature attack, or \\"Special Weapon\\", into Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game. Unlike the standard Mega Buster (Rock Buster in Japan), the Robot Master powers have limited ammunition replenished by collecting ammunition cells dropped by defeated enemies at random. Enemies also drop energy cells that replenish Mega Man's health gauge. While the player is free to proceed through the game in any order, each Robot Master is especially vulnerable to a specific weapon, which encourages the player to complete certain stages before others. The player can also revisit cleared levels. Besides the weapons taken from the Robot Masters, the player is able to pick up a platform generator item known as the \\"Magnet Beam\\" in Elec Man's stage. Mega Man also features a scoring system where players score points for defeating enemies, and earn extra points for collecting power-ups from fallen enemies and for clearing each stage. Each robot master was worth a random number between 50,000 and 100,000 points whereas Dr. Wily was always worth 200,000 points. The scoring system was removed in later Mega Man games as it provided no benefit to the player. High scores did not earn extra lives, they were not recorded, etc. and were overall meaningless. When all six Robot Master stages are completed, the seventh and last stage appears in the middle of the stage select menu. This stage, in which the player traverses Dr. Wily's robot factory, is a chain of four regular stages linked together, each containing at least one new boss. During these final stages, the six Robot Masters must also be fought again in a predetermined order before the final confrontation against Dr. Wily. Development Before Mega Man, Capcom primarily made arcade games, and their console releases were mostly ports of these titles. In the mid-1980s, Capcom made plans to develop Mega Man specifically for the Japanese home console market. They decided to bring in fresh, young talent for the small team, including artist Keiji Inafune, a recent college graduate who started on the Street Fighter team. Inafune recalled that the Mega Man development team worked extremely hard to complete the final product, with a project supervisor and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of the game. The development team for Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as \\"Inafking\\") designed and illustrated nearly all of the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. \\"We didn‚Äôt have [a lot of] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo,\\" Inafune stated. \\"Back then, people weren‚Äôt specialized and we had to do a lot of different things because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters.\\" Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue because it seemed that the color had the most shades in the console's 56-color palette (cyan included), and that selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he \\"only did half of the job in creating him\\", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal \\"mad scientist\\". The team had initially considered names such as \\"Mighty Kid\\", \\"Knuckle Kid\\", and \\"Rainbow Man\\" before settling on their final decisions. The name \\"Rainbow\\" name was considered because the character could change into seven colors based on the weapon selected. The production team chose a music motif when naming the main characters in Mega Man. The protagonist's original name is Rock and his sister's name is Roll, a play on the term \\"rock and roll\\". This type of naming would later extended to many characters throughout the series. One of the original storylines considered by the team but not used in the final game was to have Roll be kidnapped, and Rock had to rescue her. Another idea had included a boss fight against a giant Roll near the end of the game. The team decided to incorporate anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, \\"[Mega Man's] hand transforms into a gun and you can actually see it come out of his arm. We wanted to make sure that the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas.\\" The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock paper scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered \\"deep gameplay\\". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as \\"Tom Pon\\") began work on the Mega Man's scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements. Mega Man was scored by Manami Matsumae (credited as \\"Chanchacorin Manami\\"), who composed the music, created the sound effects, and programmed the data in three months, using a sound driver programmed by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi (credited as \\"Yuukichan's Papa\\"). The musical notes were translated one by one into the computer language. Matsumae was challenged by the creative limits of three notes available at any one time, and when she was unable to write songs, she created the sound effects. When the game was localized for distribution in America, Capcom changed the title of the game from Rockman to Mega Man. This moniker was created by Capcom's then-Senior Vice President Joseph Morici, who claimed it was changed merely because he did not like the original name. \\"That title was horrible,\\" Morici said. \\"So I came up with Mega Man, and they liked it enough to keep using it for the U.S. games.\\" 1UP.com's Nadia Oxford attributed this change to Capcom's belief that American children would be more interested in a game with the latter title. Reception Critics received Mega Man well, though the game sold poorly. AllGame described the NES version of the game as a \\"near-perfect blend of action, challenge and audio-visual excellence\\" and awarded it five stars, their highest rating. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN described the game as an \\"undeniable classic\\" for the NES, noting its graphics, innovative weapon-based platform gameplay, and music. IGN editor Matt Casamassina proclaimed, \\"Mega Man is one of the best examples of great graphics, amazing music and near-perfect gameplay rolled into one cartridge\\". GameSpot writers Christian Nutt and Justin Speer identified the game as a \\"winner in gameplay\\" granted its \\"low-key presentation\\". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com likewise outlined it as a \\"charming (if slightly rough) start for the series\\". Whether positive or negative, Mega Man has been commonly received as very difficult. IGN's Casamassina found the game the hardest in the franchise, and among the hardest titles on the NES. IGN's Thomas observed that its combination of high difficulty and short length hurt its replayability. According to 1UP.com, the \\"Nintendo-hard\\" Mega Man bosses set the game apart from its two immediate and more popular sequels. Total! retrospectively characterized the game as \\"an overhard and unenjoyably frustrating platform nightmare\\". Mega Man has additionally received various honors from video game journals and websites. IGN listed the game at number 30 on its \\"Top 100 NES Games of All Time\\". Nintendo Power ranked Mega Man at number 20 on its \\"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\\" in its September 1997 100th issue, then at number 61 in its \\"Top 200 Games\\" in its February 2006 200th issue. 1UP.com included it in their \\"Top 5 Overlooked Videogame Prequels\\" and as number 17 on its \\"Top 25 NES Games\\" list. British magazine The Games Machine awarded it the \\"Star Player\\" accolade after its launch in PAL regions. Legacy The North American Mega Man release's inaccurate artwork is renowned for its poor quality, and blamed by Inafune for the region's weak sales. Capcom's sales department originally believed that the game would not sell, but after Japan had received limited quantities, it had been seen as successful enough to quickly commission an American localization. As part of the rushed localization, the president of Capcom U.S.A. told the marketing representative to have a cover done by the next day, so he had a friend draw it within about six hours. Inafune blamed the game's relatively poor North American performance on its region-specific cover art, which visualized elements not found in the game: Mega Man himself resembles a middle-aged man rather than a boy, his costume is colored yellow and blue instead of being entirely blue, and he is holding a handgun instead of having his arm cannon. Over the years, the cover art became infamous in the gaming community. It has been considered one of the worst game covers of all time by publications including GameSpy, Wired, and OC Weekly. The cancelled Mega Man Universe featured a \\"Bad Box Art Mega Man\\" playable character alongside the classic 8-bit Mega Man. \\"Bad Box Art Mega Man\\" has since become a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken. With little overseas press coverage save for a full-page advertisement in Nintendo Fun Club News, sales gained momentum over word of mouth, making the game a sleeper hit. While Mega Man was not a large commercial accomplishment for Capcom, the company decided to allow the development team to create a sequel, Mega Man 2, for a 1988 Japanese release. Many of the design elements cut from the original Mega Man due to space limitations such as planned enemy characters were included in the follow-up game. Mega Man 2, with greatly improved box art, although still repeating the 'pistol' error, unchanged in directions from Capcom America, to veteran game illustrator Marc Ericksen, ('Strider,Galaga,Bad Dudes'), proved to be such a success that it solidified Mega Man as one of Capcom's longest-running franchises. Due to \\"overwhelming demand\\", Capcom reissued the original Mega Man in North America in September 1991. Capcom carried the same 8-bit graphics and sprites present in the original Mega Man into the next five games in the main series. Even though the sequels feature more complex storylines, additional gameplay mechanics, and better graphics, the core elements initiated by Mega Man remain the same throughout the series. Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 would later revert to the familiar graphical style set forth by this title. The scoring system in Mega Man has not been present in any of its sequels. According to GamesRadar, Mega Man was the first game to feature a nonlinear \\"level select\\" option, as a stark contrast to linear games like Super Mario Bros. and open world games like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid. GamesRadar credits the \\"level select\\" feature of Mega Man as the basis for the nonlinear mission structure found in most multi-mission, open world, sidequest-heavy games, such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. Remakes and re-releases Mega Man has been re-released several times since its 1987 debut. A version with enhanced graphics and arranged music was included alongside Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 in the Sega Mega Drive compilation Mega Man: The Wily Wars. Another adaptation of the game was released in Japan on the PlayStation as part of the Rockman Complete Works series in 1999. This version also features arranged music in addition to a special \\"Navi Mode\\" that directs the player in certain portions of the levels. Mega Man was compiled with nine other games in the series in the North American Mega Man Anniversary Collection released for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2004 and the Xbox in 2005. A mobile phone rendition of Mega Man developed by Lavastorm was released for download in North America in 2004. A separate, 2007 Japanese mobile phone release received a 2008 update adding the option to play as Roll. Mega Man for the NES was reissued on the Virtual Console service for three different systems: the Wii in Europe in 2007 and in North America and Japan in 2008, the 3DS in 2012, and for the Wii U in 2013. The Complete Works version of the game was made available on the PlayStation Store in both Japan and North America. An enhanced remake titled Mega Man Powered Up ‚Äî known as in Japan ‚Äî was released worldwide for the PSP in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D chibi-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make Mega Man look this way, but could not due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models was a result of the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. \\"The concept for these designs was 'toys'. We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see hanging off of keychains and such,\\" character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. \\"Not only that, I made sure to tell the designers not to skimp on any of the original Mega Man details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well.\\" As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill. Mega Man Powered Up features two styles of gameplay: \\"Old Style\\" is comparable to the NES version aside from the updated presentation, and \\"New Style\\" uses the PSP's entire widescreen and contains storyline cutscenes with voice acting, altered stage layouts, remixed music, and three difficulty modes for each stage. This mode also adds two new Robot Masters (Oil Man and Time Man). The NES version was originally intended to have a total of eight Robot Masters, but was cut down to six due to a tight schedule. Additionally, the remake lets players unlock and play through the game as the eight Robot Masters, Roll, and Protoman. The New Style stages differ in structure from that of Old Style, with some pathways only accessible to specific Robot Masters. Mega Man Powered Up also features a Challenge Mode with 100 challenges to complete, a level editor for creating custom stages, and an option to distribute fan-made levels to the PlayStation Network online service. Mega Man Powered Up received generally positive reviews, with aggregate scores of 83% on GameRankings and 82 out of 100 on Metacritic . The remake sold poorly at retail, and was later released as a paid download on the Japanese PlayStation Network digital store and as a bundled with Mega Man Maverick Hunter X in Japan and North America. Capcom additionally translated Mega Man Powered Up into Chinese for release in Asia in 2008.

The Battle of Narva Bridgehead (Estonian: Narva lahingud; German: Schlacht um den Br√ºckenkopf von Narva; Russian: –ë–∏—Ç–≤–∞ –∑–∞ –ø–ª–∞—Ü–¥–∞—Ä–º –ù–∞—Ä–≤–∞; 2 February ‚Äì 26 July 1944) was the campaign that stalled the Soviet Estonian Operation in the surroundings of the town of Narva for six months. It was the first phase of the Battle of Narva campaign fought at the Eastern Front during World War II, the second phase being the Battle of Tannenberg Line. A number of volunteer Waffen SS units from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium fought on the German side. Several Western authors dealing with the foreign national units nickname the campaign as the \\"Battle of the European SS\\". The involved Estonian conscripts fought to defend their country against the looming Soviet reoccupation. The Soviet Estonian Offensive was a follow-on of the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive. Its aim was to reconquer Estonia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Although Narva was not the main direction of the Soviet offensives on the Eastern Front in 1944, the Baltic Sea seemed the quickest way to Joseph Stalin for taking the battles to the German ground and seizing control of Finland. The Soviet Estonian offensive stalled after securing several bridgeheads over the Narva River and facing the Nazi German Wotan Line. The fierce fighting starting in February stopped at the end of April. With the Narva Offensive, 24‚Äì30 July 1944, the Red Army captured the town of Narva, as the German troops retreated 16 kilometres to the southwest to continue fighting at their prepared positions. The German forces managed to block the Soviet advance to the Baltic ports for nearly six months due to the nature of the terrain and the resistance of the international troops. Background Breaking through the Narva isthmus situated between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Peipus was of major strategic importance to the Soviet Armed Forces. The success of the Estonian Operation would have provided unobstructed advance along the coast to Tallinn, forcing Army Group North to escape from Estonia for fear of being besieged. For the Baltic Fleet trapped in an eastern bay of the Gulf of Finland, Tallinn was the closest exit to the Baltic Sea. The ejection of Army Group North from Estonia would have made southern Finland subject to air and amphibious attacks originating from Estonian bases. The retreat of Army Group North from the surroundings of Leningrad made the commanders of Finland realise that soon it may be too late to start negotiations with the Soviet Union. On 31 January 1944, General Field Marshal Keitel sent a letter to the Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, claiming that the retreat of Army Group North to the Panther Line constituted no danger whatsoever to Finland. Marshal Mannerheim did not share the optimism, expressing his concern that the road in Narva would be open not only to Estonia, but also to Finland. As the German condition worsened in the Narva front, President of Finland Juho Kusti Paasikivi was presented with Stalin's peace terms on 8 February. However, Finland stayed in the war. To separate Finland from Germany and make her defence hopeless, Stalin needed to conquer Estonia. Stalin hoped that a breakthrough at Narva would make Finland sign a peace treaty quickly. The perspective of an invasion to East Prussia through Estonia appealed even more to the Soviet Main Command, as it appeared bringing German resistance to a collapse. Stalin gave a short and clear order to the Leningrad Front on 14 February: With the tactical success of Army Group Narwa in late February, March and April, Finland terminated the negotiations with the Soviet Union on 18 April.Chronology at the EIHC =Battlefield terrain= The town of Narva is situated along the river of the same name. The river stretches from Lake Peipus northward to the Gulf of Finland. The corridor of land from Lake Peipus to the coast is about forty five kilometres wide, creating a natural choke- point for military operations. The terrain is predominately low-lying with the highest areas being around 100 meters in elevation. Much of the land is swamp and cut by numerous waterways, with other areas heavily forested. This combination of aspects meant the land was by and large well-suited for defence as the waterways, swamps, and forests tend to channelise an attacker's movements. Formation of bridgeheads On 14 January 1944, the Soviet Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts launched operations aimed at forcing the German Field Marshal Georg von K√ºchler's Army Group North back from its positions near Oranienbaum. On the third day of the offensive, the Soviets broke through German lines and pushed westward. The 109th Rifle Corps had captured Kingisepp by 1 February. Obergruppenf√ºhrer Felix Steiner's III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps fought a rearguard action until it reached the eastern bank of the Narva. Army Group Sponheimer blew up the ice on the southern 50 kilometre section of the Narva river from Lake Peipus to Krivasoo swamp. North of the town, the 4th Soviet Rifle Regiment reached the Narva river, establishing a small bridgehead across it on 2 February 1944. The fighting to the east of Narva had left a large number of German troops stranded on the wrong side of the front.Marc Rikmenspoel (1999). Soldiers of the Waffen SS. J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Winnipeg Simultaneously, the 122nd Rifle Corps crossed the river south of the town in V√§√§ska settlement, establishing a bridgehead in the Krivasoo swamp 10 kilometres south of Narva town. =Ivangorod bridgehead= The main brunt of the Soviet attack was where the Germans had least expected it ‚Äì the III SS Panzer Corps, positioned east of the strategically important town of Narva and holding the German bridgehead on the opposite bank. The Corps were mostly made up of SS volunteer formations. The Dutchmen of the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland and the various nationalities of the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland began frantically digging in along what had become known as the Narva line. The defensive line ran for eleven kilometres, from the estate of Lilienbach two kilometres north- east from the highway bridge over Narva river, to the settlement of Dolgaya Niva three kilometres in the south, bulging eastwards from the river. The 4th SS Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland defended the northern half of the bridgehead while the 11th SS Division Nordland held the southern flank. Attacking them along the highway and railway were the four Soviet divisions of the 43rd and the 109th Rifle Corps. The Nederland Brigade, the 1st battalion of the SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 24 Danmark, and the German artillery inflicted heavy casualties on the Red Army, who failed to reach their operational goal of destroying the bridgehead. =Krivasoo bridgehead in first half of February= In the Krivasoo swamp ten kilometres south of Narva, the Soviet 1078th Regiment and the ski battalion of the 314th Rifle Division crossed the river under a heavy German air and artillery attack in four hours. Despite the resistance of the 29th Estonian Police Battalion, the 314th Rifle Division approached the Auvere Railway Station 10 kilometres west of Narva, threatening to cut the railway behind the III SS Panzer Corps and the two division-sized units of Army Group Narwa. The Soviet author Fyodor Paulman depicts the battles for Auvere station as ferocious, causing serious casualties to the 314th Rifle Division. Two regiments of the 125th Rifle Division were sent to assist them. The renewed Soviet units captured the railway crossing near Auvere station on 6 February, losing it on the same day under the fire of the German coastal artillery. From then on, the Soviet forces remained passive in the direction of Auvere, giving Army Group Narwa valuable time to regain their strength. =Omuti, Permisk√ºla and Gorodenka bridgeheads in the south= Two Soviet platoons of the 147th Rifle Regiment volunteered to cross the river to the settlements of Omuti, Permisk√ºla and Gorodenka forty kilometres south of Narva on 2 February. The bank was defended by the 30th Estonian Police Battalion. The defence was built as an array of small bridgeheads on the east bank, appearing to the Soviets as a carefully prepared defence system in front of the main defence line. Repelled for the first time, the Soviet headquarters took some hours to prepare the attack by the 219th and 320th Rifle Regiments. The Estonians pulled back to their bank during the Soviet attacks, stopping the advance of the Red Army and causing heavy losses. Voldemar Madisso (1997). Nii nagu see oli. (As It Was) SE & JS, Tallinn Despite the heroics of the Soviet commanders, only a small platoon commanded by Lieutenant Morozov fortified themselves on the west bank. Soviet difficulties in February The Soviet operations were accompanied by major problems in supply, as the major transport connections had been largely destroyed by the Germans and the remaining poor roads were threatening to fall apart in the thaw closing in. Another failure was in intelligence, as all Soviet partisan troops that had been sent to Estonia were destroyed. In their report on 8 February, the War Council of the Leningrad Front saw the preparations for the landings across the Narva river as unsatisfactory: The 98th and the 131st Soviet Armoured Divisions established a bridgehead on the west bank near the settlement of Siivertsi further north from Narva on 12 February. The bridgehead soon became the most critical position on the whole Narva front. If the Soviets succeeded there, Narva city would fall quickly and the Narva bridgehead on the east bank of the river would be cut off. All available units were thrown against Siivertsi bridgehead. =First attack of Soviet main forces= Until the second week of February, the two armies of the Leningrad Front had deployed only vanguard elements. Army General Leonid A. Govorov of Leningrad Front ordered the 2nd Shock Army to break through the German defence line north and south of Narva town, move the front fifty kilometres westwards and continue towards the town of Rakvere. The artillery of the 2nd Shock army opened fire on all German positions on 11 February. The 30th Guards Rifle Corps, an elite unit usually used in breaching defence lines, joined the Soviet units attempting to seize the Auvere station. The guards riflemen widened the bridgehead to ten kilometres along the front. The remains of the German 227th and 170th Divisions retreated. General Major Romancov ordered an assault at Auvere settlement by the Air Force and artillery on 13 February, with the 64th Guard Rifle Division seizing the village in a surprise attack. Half a kilometre westward from Auvere station, the 191st Guard Rifle Regiment cut through the railway two kilometres from the Tallinn highway, which was the last way out for Army Group Narwa, but was repelled by the 170th Infantry Division and the 502nd Tank Battalion. Soviet landing operations on 14 February The situation on the Narva front was turning into a catastrophe for the Wehrmacht in mid-February. The Leningrad Front had formed two bridgeheads north and south of Tallinn highway, the closest of them a few hundred metres away from the highway. Army Group Narwa was in direct danger of getting besieged. The defense of the highway was held only by small infantry units formed of the field divisions of the Luftwaffe, supported by Panther tanks after every few hundred metres along the highway. They obscured direct observation of the highway by placing branches of spruce trees along it, however, this did not distract the Soviet artillery from keeping the highway under constant bombardment. The faith of the Army Group Narwa, that the defense could go on like this, started to diminish. Karl Gailit (1995). Eesti s√µdur s√µjatules. (Estonian Soldier in Warfare.) Estonian Academy of National Defense Press, Tallinn =Meerapalu landing operation= Seeing the condition of the front, Hitler ordered the 20th Estonian SS-Volunteer Division to be replaced on the Nevel front and transported to the Narva front.Official diary of the Sponheimer Detachment. KTB Archives, Berlin The arrival of the Estonian Division coincided with the prepared landing operation by the left flank of the Leningrad Front to the west coast of Lake Peipus, 120 kilometres south of Narva. The Soviet 90th Rifle Division seized Piirissaar island in the middle of the lake on 12 February, with taking the Estonian city of Tartu as its goal. The Estonian Division was placed at the Yershovo bridgehead on the east coast of Lake Peipus. The 374th Soviet Rifle Regiment crossed Lake Peipus on 14 February, seized the coastal village of Meerapalu in a surprise attack, and formed a bridgehead. Additional Soviet units attacking across the lake were destroyed by 21 German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. A. K√ºbar (1993). Veebruar 1944. Viru S√µna, 9 March (February 1944). On the next day, the Soviet units were expelled from the west coast by the I.Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 45 Estland and an East Prussian battalion of the 44th Grenadier Regiment. Estonian sources estimate the Soviet casualties to be in the thousands. A battalion of the 44th Grenadier Regiment regained Piirissaar island on 17 February. =Merek√ºla landing operation= To break the last resistance, simultaneously with preparing the Meerapalu landing operation, Govorov ordered the 260th Independent Naval Infantry Brigade to prepare for an amphibious attack to the German rear in Narva. This was an elite unit, specially trained for an amphibious assault. They were transported to the Narva front by a naval unit with 26 vessels. The troops were to assault from the Gulf of Finland, landing several miles behind the German lines near the coastal settlement of Merek√ºla. The first company were to destroy the railway and Auvere station, the second company to occupy the railway east from Auvere, and the third company to cover the left flank and to blow up the railway bridge east of Auvere. Estonian sources claim that as the instructions for later action, Major Maslov ordered the slaughter of civilians. Eesti S√µna (1944). Testimony of Major Sinkov Another amphibious unit was intended to land after them. However, Estonian counterintelligence had acquired data on an amphibious operation being prepared to land in Merek√ºla in 1939. Preparing the Panther Line in 1944, the Germans placed their artillery on the coastal battery built by the Military of Estonia specifically against such a landing. The 517 troops commenced their operation on 14 February, landing directly in front of the German coastal artillery. The Norge Regiment and the coastal guards, supported by three Tiger tanks quickly responded. While the 2nd Shock Army artillery placed near Auvere failed to begin their attack at the agreed time, Bor'ba za Sovetskuyu Pribaltiku v Velikoj Otechestvennoy Voyne (Fight for Soviet Baltics in the Great Patriotic War). Vol. 3. Liesma, Riga in seven and a half hours of fierce fighting, the Soviet beachhead was annihilated. Narva Offensive, 15‚Äì28 February General Ivan Fedyuninsky took the 13th Rifle Division from the reserve to support the 30th Guards Rifle Corps' offensive aimed at Auvere station on 15 February. Supported by heavy gunfire, the 45th Rifle Guard Division broke through to the railway again 500 metres to the west of Auvere station, but a powerful attack by German dive bombers pinned them down. The Tallinn railway, supplying the surroundings of Narva, was cut from two places, threatening to encircle the III SS Panzer Corps in the northeast. In the course of the action, the Soviet 30th Guards Rifle Corps lost 7773 troops and ceased to exist as a combat-ready unit. Units of Army Group Narwa, supported by tanks, went on to counterattack, stopping the Soviet rifle corps' advance. As another reserve, Fedyuninsky brought in the 124th Rifle Corps on 20 February, reinforcing it by the artillery of the destroyed divisions. Despite heavy resistance from the German 61st Infantry Division, the rifle corps mounted a powerful strike behind the railway. Frie√üner hurried his forces southwards against the 124th Rifle Corps advance. The German 61st Infantry Division and the German Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 1, supported by the 502nd Heavy Tank Battalion, drove the rifle corps back to the river in a pitched battle. F.K.Rumyancev (1971). Ognyom i taranom (By Fire and Ram). Leningrad After the offensive, the weakened Soviet 30th Guard Rifle Corps was replaced by the 10th Rifle Corps. The 214th Division and an Estonian battalion cut a rifle division off from the rest of their forces on 28 February. The 43rd Soviet Rifle Corps restored the situation. Destruction of Soviet bridgeheads north of Narva The Estonian Division arrived at the week following 13 February, at the height of the fighting around Narva. To strengthen the German defense in the north, the division, reinforced by newly conscripted Estonians, were attached to the III SS Panzer Corps. They were to defend the line against the 378th Rifle Division, the 340th Machine-Gun Battalion, and the 803th Zenith Artillery Regiment at the Riigik√ºla bridgehead seven kilometres to the north of Narva town. Steiner threw the division into battle on 20 February. The Soviet units with ample experience from the Siege of Leningrad had a significant number of women within their ranks. Retreat was forbidden under the penalty of death. As this was the main Soviet direction of attack for the moment, the Estonians frantically fortified the line with mine fields, barbed wire, and a large number of artillery pieces across the river north of the bridgehead. The terrain was well known to some of the Estonians, as an army rifle practice field was located on the exact spot before the war. For there first in Narva the Estonian Division had the Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 45 and the Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 separate the Riigik√ºla bridgehead from the Siivertsi bridgehead on 21 February. The failure of their following attacks made it clear that direct attacks were impossible because of the batteries across the river. Instead, the \\"rolling\\" tactics were applied learned by the Estonian officers in the Estonian National Defence College before World War II. This meant piercing small shock platoons into the Soviet trenches which were impossible to spot by the artillery. It was considered a matter of national honour to annihilate the Soviet bridgehead by 24 February, the Estonian Independence Day. J√ºri Remmelgas (1955). Kolm kuuske.(Three Spruces) Estonian House, Stockholm The Soviet bridgehead was reinforced with the 1078th Rifle Regiment increasing the number of the defenders to 776 with 14 assault guns. The Red Army command was convinced in the well-placed artillery fire hitting back every possible attack. The II.Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 led by Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Rudolf Bruus and the German artillery appeared as if committing a direct assault while a platoon of the 6th Company led by Rein Oskar M√§nnik threw themselves into the Soviet trenches. At first, the Soviets resisted the assault but after running out of hand grenades, they were forced to retreat over the frozen river. The next task was the destruction of Siivertsi‚ÄìVepsk√ºla bridgehead four kilometres north of Narva defended by 1,100 troops of the 378th Rifle Division with 20 assault guns. The attack was commanded by Standartenf√ºhrer Paul Vent. The Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 45 made a direct assault at the bridgehead on 29 February. Simultaneously, the Waffen- Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 in their attempt to attack from the left flank ran into the Soviet fortifications and crossed a mine field. As the I.Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 lost almost all of its officers, the Unterscharf√ºhrer Harald Nugiseks stepped in as the leader of the attack. He immediately changed tactics, loading the supply of hand grenade onto sledges so the attackers would not have to crawl back for the supplies over the mine field. Leo Tammiksaar (2001). L√ºhike √ºlevaade m√µningatest Eesti √ºksustest Wehrmachtis, politseis ja SS-is. (A Brief Overview on some Estonian Units in Wehrmacht, Police, and SS. In Estonian). Lennuliiklusteeninduse AS, Tallinn With the hand grenades being passed on along the trenches, the bridgehead was squeezed in from the north by the \\"rolling\\" tactics. The SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 24 Danmark took the Siivertsi cemetery attacking from the northern suburbs of Narva but could not destroy a Soviet machine-gun strong point inside a massive granite monument erected to the honour of the perished soldiers of the White Northwestern Army during the Estonian War of Independence. Eventually, the machine-gunners were killed by a flamethrower. Another machine-gun strong point was in the wreck of a Tiger tank, which was destroyed by Ago Loorp√§rg shooting at it from a trophy Soviet 45 mm gun. The Soviet bridgehead was squeezed into a few hundred metres of river bank around the ruins of Vepsk√ºla settlement by 5 March. In a surprise attack of the I.Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 45, the bridgehead was split into three parts and \\"rolled\\" down by hand grenades. A small Soviet bridgehead still left on the west bank was cleared by the II.Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 on 6 March. The setbacks on Narva front came as an unpleasant surprise for the leadership of the Leningrad Front blaming it on the arrival of the Estonian Division. Both sides rushed for reinforcements. The 59th Army was brought to Narva and the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps placed under command of the Leningrad Front. Soviet offensives in March =Narva Offensive, 1‚Äì4 March= On 1 March, the newly arrived Soviet 59th Army, supported by the fire of 2500 assault guns and more than 100 tanks, attacked the 214th Infantry Division from the Krivasoo bridgehead twenty kilometres south west of Narva. The goal of the attack was the nearest connecting road in Kurem√§e village. After three days of fierce battle, the Soviet army broke through the defense and advanced towards the highway to J√µhvi. The 59th Army encircled the strong points of the 214th Infantry Division, and the Estonian 658th and 659th Eastern Battalions, which continued resisting. Lieutenant General Ivan Korvnikov in charge of the Soviet 59th Army delayed the advance, referring to the lack of artillery support and scarcity of manpower. This gave time for Frie√üner to move in all available forces and stop the Soviet advance. German losses in these battles were in thousands. A Soviet regiment of the 2nd Rifle Division attempted a surprise assault over Lake Peipus to seize the road along the north shore of the lake on 2 March. Up to 500 of them were killed by the 225th Infantry Division, with a large number of weapons, including seven assault guns gained as trophies. Units of the 59th Army attacked from the Krivasoo bridgehead on 4 March. =Narva Offensive, 6‚Äì24 March= On 6 March, the new Soviet Narva Offensive began with the air raid at Narva and the nine kilometre segment of Tallinn highway connected to the town. The explosives, attached to the main target, the bridge over Narva river were hit and blown up. The baroque style Old Town was levelled by 200 aircraft dropping 3600 bombs, with no buildings left intact. On the next night, another air raid followed at Ivangorod bridgehead on the opposite bank of the river. As the local inhabitants had been transported from the two towns, virtually no civilian casualties occurred. Instead, the German units remained in the towns were heavily hit and a great deal of military equipment lost. In the morning of 8 March, the Soviet air force and the artillery of the 2nd Shock Army fired 100,000 shells and grenades at the three weakened German regiments defending the town. The operation continued with the assault of the 30th Guards Rifle Division and numerous tanks, focusing on the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland Govorov realised that the Narva line could not be breached before the German bridgehead on the eastern side of the river was annihilated. On 11 March, a heavy assault was ordered at the ruins of the Lilienbach estate two kilometres to the north east from Narva, defended by the SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter. After an artillery duel between the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Netherland and the advancing Soviet units, the attack disintegrated into fierce hand-to-hand fighting between Soviet infantry and outnumbered SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter. After several hours of fierce combat, the 30th Guard Rifle Corps had suffered enough losses to fall back. Govorov decided to shift the focus of the Narva Offensive to the north of Narva. =North of Narva= On 8 March, three Divisions of the 14th Rifle Corps attacked the positions of the Estonian Division in Siivertsi, five kilometres north of Narva. The artillery of the Estonian Rifle Corps was placed under their command. For the first time, Estonians were facing Estonians in combat over Narva river. Loudspeakers were set up on the Soviet side, calling the Estonians on the German side to swap side. On 17 March, after massive bombardment of the positions of the Estonian Division, and 500 deaths from the Soviet 1256th Rifle Regiment, the Soviets managed to establish a bridgehead on the west bank of the river eight kilometres north of Narva. Assisted by the artillery of the III Germanic SS Panzer Corps, the Estonian machine-gunners, placed along the bank, cleared the bridgehead by the following night. The three Divisions of the 14th Rifle Corps were destroyed and the remains reformed in the rear. Karl Gailit (1995). Eesti s√µdur s√µjatules. (Estonian Soldier in Warfare) Estonian Academy of National Defense Press, Tallinn =Soviet bombing raids against Estonian cities= The Soviet Long Range Aviation, subordinated directly to the Headquarters of Soviet Armed Forces, was committed to the task of bombing key Estonian towns of Petseri, Tartu, and the national capital Tallinn. The heaviest of the air assaults was at Tallinn, on 9 March. A week before, the Mayor of Tallinn had given an order to the city dwellers to leave the town, but the evacuation failed. The extent of the attack was beyond the expectations of the local people and the headquarters of the Army Group North. A bombing run consisting of 300 IL-4 planes throwing 3068 bombs, 1725 of them explosive and 1300 incendiary, inflicted heavy damage to the city. The fire brigades were scarce on water, as Soviet saboteurs had blown up the city pumping station before the air raid. Military damage was minor, with a few military installations and supply stores destroyed. The major military loss was the burning of a million litres of fuel in the fuel depot. Of the enterprises with some military importance, the \\"Luther\\" plywood factory and the \\"Urania-Werke\\"-run cable factory were destroyed. Most of the bombs fell on the dwellings and public buildings, including the Estonia Theatre, St. Nicholas Church, the city synagogue, four cinemas, and the Tallinn City Archives with their collection of medieval documents. A large part of the wooden suburbs burnt down and the city centre suffered major damage. According to the official report, 757 people were killed, of whom 586 were civilians, 50 were military personnel, and 121 were prisoners-of-war. 213 had serious injuries, 446 had minor injuries. Amongst the injured were 65 military servicemen and 75 prisoners-of-war. Later, more victims were found, with the number of deaths estimated at up to 800. More than 20,000 people were left without a shelter in the spring thaw, while the military objects were almost untouched.Tallinn tules (Tallinn on Fire). Re-printed archive materials. Tallinn City Archives, 1997 A bombing raid against Tartu conducted on the night before 26 March destroyed dwellings and public buildings in the city centre and killed 67 citizens. Petseri was bombed throughout the night before 1 April, causing severe damage to the town and the Holy Dormition monastery, and killing hieroconfessor Macarius, schema-bishop of Malovishery, who was declared a martyr by the Russian Orthodox Church.Hieroconfessor Macarius, Schema-Bishop Of Malovishery St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, McKinney, Texas Regarding the high number of civilian casualties and low damage to military and strategic installations in the cities, the Soviet bombing raids were conducted primarily to destroy the resistance morale of the local civilians. Regardless of Soviet intentions, the high civilian casualty toll of the raids had significantly increased the hostility of the Estonian public towards the Soviet army. On 27 February, a Soviet air raid had hit children playing in the school yard of Luunja Parish, killing four. The date of their burial was turned into a national memorial day, accompanied by the poem \\"Uus Heroodes\\" (\\"Modern Herod\\") published by Henrik Visnapuu. More Estonians felt an urge to fight against the Soviet advance.A.Aasmaa (1999). Tagasivaateid.(Looking Back. In Estonian) In: Mart Tamberg (Comp.). Eesti mehed s√µjatules. EVT√ú, Saku A slogan was written on the ruins of the Estonia Theatre, saying: The slogan became the title of the newspaper of the Estonian Division. =End of offensive= On 17 March, the six divisions, armoured vehicles and artillery of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps and the newly brought 6th Rifle Corps continued the Soviet offensive, attacking the weakened 61st Infantry Division in the defense of Auvere railway station. The goal of the offensive was the Corps headquarters on the Lastekodum√§gi by the Tallinn highway fifteen kilometres west of Narva. The defense by the 162nd Grenadier Regiment, having built up as an array of posts between the hills and the railway, was shaken by the massive preparatory gunfire and air attack. The Soviet 930th Regiment broke through the thinned defense line of the 61st Infantry Division to the railway, pushing towards the German headquarters. The six Soviet T-34 tanks were destroyed by the two Tiger tanks of Lieutenant Carius, forcing the Soviet infantry into withdrawal. On 22 March, the 61st Infantry Division repelled ten Soviet assaults.Unpublished material from the official war diary of Army Group Narwa On the same day in Ivangorod, the Red Army troops annihilated the SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter, 5th Company and broke in the regiment's rear. SS regimental headquarters troopsCommanded by SS Captain Heinz Fr√ºhauf. assaulted the 150-man Soviet force, destroying them in heavy fighting, and retaking the regiment's trenches. By the end of the Narva Offensive on 24 March, the 2nd Shock Army had lost its combat-readiness for larger operations. According to an Estonian estimate, it had also suffered a toll of around 150,000 troops in dead and wounded. On 24 March, Govorov asked the Stavka for permission to switch the mode on Narva front from offense to defense. Army Group Narwa had suffered the loss of around 30,000 men. Strachwitz offensive Strachwitz with fellow soldiers prior to the offensive, 21 March 1944 The High Command of the German Armed Forces were designing an offensive after a long while at the Eastern Front, choosing Narva as the location. Exploiting the favourable situation, commanders of Army Group Narwa regrouped, planning to destroy the Krivasoo bridgehead. On 26 March, the Strachwitz Battle Group (the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks) targeted the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the Tallinn railway. The assault was supported by an air strike. Tank commander Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz von Gro√ü-Zauche und Camminetz considered the heavy Tigers useless for operating in the swamp, exploiting the lighter Panther tanks instead. The East-Prussian grenadiers followed, penetrating the fortified positions of the Soviet Rifle Corps. The \\"Armoured Count\\" was out cheering the attackers on personally, driving his offroad vehicle to decorate the bravest with Iron Crosses, chocolate and cognac in the middle of the heaviest combat. By the end of the day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the \\"west sack\\" of the bridgehead were encircled. As Strachwitz had predicted, the Rifle Corps counterattacked on the following day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviet Rifle Corps. Small tank units in two groups broke through the lines of the Rifle Corps in several places, splitting the bridgeheads in two-halves. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. Attacking in small platoons the west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, claiming 6,000 Soviet riflemen dead. The \\"east sack\\" defenders of the Krivasoo bridgehead, defended by the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were confused by Strachwitz Battle Group's deception attack on 6 April, intending to leave an impression of aiming to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army from Auvere station, starting with heavy bombardment. The forest in the positions of the 59th Army was ignited and bombed by dive bombers. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army defense, separating the two rifle corps from each other and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in the freshly re- deployed 8th Army. Their attempt to cut out the Tiger I tanks from their rear was repelled by Lieutenant G√ºnther Famula keeping the road to the supplies open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered to switch the mode on Narva front to defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops for all purposes, was removed from the bridgehead. Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds as the eleventh man in the history of the award on 15 April.Walther-Peer Fellgiebel (2000). Die Tr√§ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939‚Äì1945 (Bearers of Knight's Crosses and Iron Crosses 1939‚Äì1945. In German). Podzun-Pallas The 8th Army repelled the German attack, lasting from 19 to 24 April. The Germans lost 2,235 troops as dead and captured in the offensive, while the total of German casualties in April was 13,274, all causes. The Soviet casualties in April are unknown, but are estimated by Mart Laar to at least 30,000 men for all purposes. The losses exhausted the strengths of the both sides. For May and June, the front stagnated with the exception of the artillery, air, sniper activity and clashes between reconnaissance platoons. Narva Offensives, May and June On 12 May, a battle was fought near Auvere. The German 112th Infantry Division counted 272 fallen Red Army soldiers on the battlefield. On 7 June, hundreds of Soviet guns opened up all across the seven-mile Narva front. The 13th Air Army encountered minimal Luftwaffe opposition. Special attention was paid to the positions of the Danmark Regiment. As the smoke from the bombardment cleared, the Soviet infantry attacked in human waves. The Nederland Brigade's artillery opened up, tearing holes in the advancing Red Army soldiers. Pushing through the fire, the Soviet troops made it to the Danmark Regiment's positions and began heavy fighting. Over the next days, the Danes held their positions against the Red Army. On 12 June, the 2nd Shock Army used larger units to attack German positions in the sector of the III SS Panzer Corps, XXVI and XXXXIII Army Corps in Ivangorod. On this day at the \\"Sunshine\\" outpost to the southeast of the Narva bridgehead, the Danish NCO Egon Christophersen literally saved the main front, when with a small assault troop he counterattacked German trenches that had been seized by the Russians and regained them in hand-to-hand combat. Christophersen and his men then defended the positions against all attackers, enabling the broken German lines to reconsolidate and hold. Christophersen was awarded the Knight's Cross. The attack was repulsed in 800 Soviet deaths. Fighting went on for two more weeks with no substantial advance by either side. On 16 July, the Red Army forces found their way in the trenches of the SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 24 Danmark. The attack was repulsed by nightfall. On the afternoon of 20 July, the Soviet air force carried out a five-wave attack on Mustvee harbour, wounding 40‚Äì50 personnel of the German flotilla on the west coast of Lake Peipus. While continuing attacks on the Narva front, the Stavka had begun to look elsewhere for their breakthrough. A new offensive, codenamed Bagration after the Napoleonic-era Russian field marshal, was launched on 22 June against Army Group Centre. Narva Offensive, 24‚Äì30 July = Soviet preparations= For the commencement of the Soviet Narva Offensive Operation on 24 July, most of the Soviet units and artillery were concentrated in the Krivasoo bridgehead in the south. The Soviet operational goals were the Auvere railway station defended by the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian), and the Sirgala settlement defended by the East Prussian 11th Infantry Division north west from the Soviet bridgehead. The first attack by the 8th Army was to be conducted by the 117th and the 122nd Rifle Corps. The rest of the 8th Army included the 124th and 112th Rifle Corps. Their goal was to break through the German defense of the station, while the 2nd Shock Army was to break through the defense of the III SS Panzer Corps stationed on the river north of Narva. The 2nd Shock Army included the 131st and the 191st Rifle Divisions, the 109th Rifle Corps, the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps, two artillery brigades, the 328th Separate Heavy Artillery Division, four Rocket Artillery Launcher Regiments, the 760th Anti-Tank Regiment, and 62 armoured vehicles. The two armies were to encircle and destroy the III SS Panzer Corps. In the prepared assault, the Soviet artillery had an eightfold superiority over its German counterpart. The Soviet air force consisted of 546 bombers against 49 German dive bombers. The standing manpower in the Krivasoo bridgehead was 46,385 Soviets against the 17,100 German troops at the defense of Auvere station. However, the Soviet force was unaware of the recently constructed Tannenberg line, granting the German side an element of surprise. =German preparations= The Soviet success in Belorussia and Ukraine brought the High Command of the German Armed Forces to propose a withdrawal of the Army Group Narwa and the 18th Army to the line between Riga and Daugavpils 400 kilometres south of Narva. The aim of the officers was to keep the battle front as short as possible and to use the available troops in the Ukraine. On 12 July, the commander of the army detachment Infantry General Johannes Frie√üner proposed the plan to Hitler, whose reaction was to stand or die at the Narva line. Simultaneously, the German Headquarters had intelligence data on the Leningrad Front preparing for the Narva Offensive. The Army Group North were out of reserves. Disregarding Hitler's order, Frie√üner ordered a new defensive line built, the Tannenberg Line (Tannenbergstellung), with the main defenses located on the three Sinim√§ed Hills fifteen kilometres to the west of Narva. On 21 July, Frie√üner asked permission to withdraw to the prepared positions. As Hitler was afraid, the Finnish will of resistance would suffer from it, he informed the Finnish High Command about his plans. Finding out, that the withdrawal to a new line was not considered a problem by the Finnish side, Hitler gave the order to retreat. =Battle of Auvere= In the morning of 24 July, the Soviet assault commenced with 30‚Äì50 batteries firing 17,000 shells and grenades (2,000 tons), inflicting significant casualties to the Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 45 Estland in Auvere estate and 44th East Prussian Regiment in Sirgala settlement. After two hours of preparatory artillery fire, the two regiments were attacked from the air. Three German and eight Soviet bombers were shot down in air combat. Under artillery cover, the Soviet 122nd Rifle Corps and a tank brigade pierced into the East Prussian positions, while the 117th Rifle Corps encircled the Estonian regiment, who reformed themselves in a circular defense. Relieved by a company of Panther tanks and three Nebelwerfer rocket artillery launchers, the Estonians went on a counterattack. The East Prussians were saved by the swift movement of artillery behind them clearing their previous positions from the Soviets. Forces of the 117th Rifle Corps reached the headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS 45 Estland who resisted by heavy machine-gun fire in circular defense. The support by the anti-tank weapons of the 14th Company and the aid of the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland helped to seize the main front line back to the control of the Estonian Regiment. Subsequent attempts by the 117th and 122nd Rifle Corps to break through were repelled in a similar way, causing them to lose 3,000 men, compared to the loss of 800 troops of Army Group Narwa. The Soviet attack at Auvere and Sirgala forced the III SS Panzer Corps to a hasty withdrawal from their positions in the Ivangorod bridgehead on the opposite bank of Narva. The Soviet 8th Army threatened to reach the Tannenberg Line before the Germans. =2nd Shock Army crossing Narva River= The memorial of the 2nd Shock Army's command post 1944 On the morning of 25 July 1944 Soviet assault guns fired 280,000 shells and grenades at the positions of the Estonian Division across Narva river, who were covering the right flank of the III SS Panzer Corps. The density of the assault guns was 160 per kilometre of front line. The shock made the trenches collapse on both sides of the front line. After the artillery strike, the bombers and assault guns moved in to destroy the remaining strong points. Regiments of the 131st and the 191st Rifle Corps were ordered to cross the river on boats and rafts, accompanied by \\"Svyaschennaya Voyna\\" and the anthem of the Soviet Union playing from the loudspeakers. The assault guns and the machine-guns of the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) along with the dive bombers destroyed the first attempts of the 2nd Shock Army, until the Estonians ran out of ammunition. The focus of the Soviet attack drifted to the Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46, causing it to lose co-ordination and retreat to the Peeterristi crossroads on the highway nine kilometres outside Narva. The retreat opened access to the Soviets behind the retreating Army Corps. The 131st Rifle Division advanced towards the highway, as the 191st Rifle Division turned south towards Narva to cut the Germans out. =Defense of German withdrawal along Tallinn highway= The Soviet advance along the river to Narva was faced by the 2nd Battalion, Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS 47. Major Alfons Rebane had saved the detachment from the Soviet bombardment by ordering them to dig into new trenches the night before. Aiming at the 2nd Battalion's positions according to their data, the artillery of the 2nd Shock Army had hit empty trenches. Inflicting heavy casualties to the 191st Rifle Division, the battalion stopped the Soviet from getting to Narva. As the 131st Rifle Division threatened to cut between Rebane's battalion and the 46th SS Regiment five kilometres to the west, Rebane shifted his front segment a kilometre towards the left. The assaults by the 556th and 546th Rifle Regiments were repulsed with great casualties by the Estonians rounded up to defend the highway by the Olgina estate. In Peeterristi estate nine kilometres from Narva, Major Friedrich Kurg reassembled the 180 troops remained of the 2nd Battalion, Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS 46 to keep the 131st Rifle Division away from the highway and counterattacked. Luftflotte 1 was sent into the air to provide cover for the withdrawing III SS Panzer Corps. Despite their efforts, the 137 German aircraft were overwhelmed by the 800-plus Thirteenth Air Army. Suffering the near destruction of the Waffen- Grenadier Regiment der SS 46, the joint Estonian defense line with the 2nd Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment of the SS 47 some four kilometres to the west held the Soviet attack, while the III SS Panzer Corps withdrew across the Narva bridge to the Tannenberg Line. Behind them, the Corps destroyed the highway with road destruction machinery. The German units that failed to retreat exactly on the agreed timetable, immediately faced heavy Soviet assaults. The main German casualty of the retreat to the Tannenberg Line were the 700 troops of the SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 48 General Seyffardt. In the night before 26 July, the regiment was the last to leave Narva, while the Soviets were already gaining control of the highway behind them and Soviet armoured vehicles were crossing the Narva bridge. The Dutchmen of the 2nd Battalion, SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter; covering the retreat of SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 48 General Seyffardt, were rescued from encirclement by the 1st Battalion, SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter. Encircled in the swamps between the highway and the railway, the withdrawing General Seyffardt were pinned down by the fighter-bombers of the Red Air Force and annihilated by the 191st Rifle Division. In general, the withdrawal was completed according to the German plans. The SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Regiment 49 De Ruyter started digging in on the left (north) flank of the Tannenberg Line, the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) in the centre, and the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland on the right (south) flank. The Red Army captured Narva, ending the six-month struggle for the town. While the Soviets celebrated victory, their main goal ‚Äì the encirclement of the III SS Panzer Corps and the destruction of Army Group North ‚Äì remained unreached. Casualties According to the data of the Headquarters of Soviet Armed Forces, the casualties of the Leningrad Front in January and February 1944 were 56,564 dead or missing and 170,876 wounded or sick. The Leningrad Front also lost 462 armoured vehicles and 260 bombers during the period. The share of the battles around Narva is unknown. Estonian historian Mart Laar believes that, considering the length of the operation, roughly half of the losses can be accounted for the battle of Narva. According to his account, from 1 March to 14 September, the Leningrad Front lost 76,301 troops as dead or missing and 303,291 as wounded or sick in the Narva campaign. An estimated half of them account for March and April. Excluding the losses in the Narva Operation, 24‚Äì30 July 1944 (accounted within the losses in the Battle of Tannenberg Line), Laar's estimates of the Soviet losses in the Battle for Narva Bridgehead total at approximately 65,000 dead or missing and 235,000 wounded or sick. This is in accordance with the estimation of the Soviet researcher F.I. Paulman, stating that the 2nd Shock Army lost more than 30,000 troops in February. Major General Rodin provided a different account, proposing 6033 dead or missing and 7144 as wounded or sick for the Leningrad Front in the Narva campaign but Laar disputes these numbers, insisting that they make no sense because the ratio of the dead to the wounded generally ranges from 1 / 3 to 1 / 4. The German Army Group Narwa lost 23,963 troops as dead, wounded and missing in action in February 1944. During the following months until 30 July 1944, additional 34,159 German soldiers were lost, 5,748 of them dead and 1,179 missing in action. The total of the German casualties in the Battle for Narva Bridgehead is estimated at 12,000 dead, missing or captured and 46,000 wounded or sick.

He is a former Microsoft executive. He assisted Microsoft in creating many of the system platform components including Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, server products such as SQL Server, and developer technologies. He is best known for building Microsoft's server business. He is also known for his leading role in the architecture and development of the directory services technology Banyan VINES. He has won numerous awards in his career such as the Technical Excellence Person of the Year in 2001. Jim Allchin led the Platforms division at Microsoft, overseeing the development of Windows client from Windows 98 to Windows Vista, Windows Server from NT Server 4.0 to Windows Server 2008, as well as several releases of Microsoft server products as well as Windows CE and Windows Embedded line of products. After serving sixteen years at Microsoft, Allchin retired in early 2007 when Microsoft officially released the Windows Vista operating system to consumers. He is now a professional musician. Biography =Early years= Allchin was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1951. While he was still an infant, the Allchin family moved to Keysville, Florida, where his parents worked on a farm. Allchin grew up in a tin-roof house built by his father. Later, Allchin and his older brother Keith also worked on the farm to support the family financially. While fixing equipment on the farm, Allchin developed an interest in engineering. He studied Electrical engineering at the University of Florida, but dropped out to play in a number of bands. He later returned to the university and graduated with BS in Computer Science in 1973. After receiving his degree, Allchin joined Texas Instruments, where he helped build a new operating system. Afterwards, he followed a former lecturer, Dick Kiger, to Wyoming, where he helped him to start a new company offering computer services nationwide, before moving on to another company in Dallas, Texas. Allchin returned to his studies, earning the degree of MS in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1980. Allchin wrote a language-independent, portable file system while at Stanford. While pursuing his PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology in the early eighties, he was the primary architect of the Clouds distributed object-oriented operating system; his PhD thesis was entitled \\"An Architecture for Reliable Decentralized Systems\\". In 1983, Allchin was recruited to Banyan by founder Dave Mahoney, eventually being Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. During his seven years at Banyan, he created the VINES distributed operating system, including the StreetTalk directory protocol. Bill Gates tried to recruit a reluctant Allchin to join Microsoft for a year and successfully convinced him in 1990. Gates told him that whatever he created would have a wider customer base through Microsoft than anyone else. Allchin is known as a prolific computer programmer/engineer. Allchin is also known for debugging systems remotely by having the person on the phone toggle in hexadecimal via front panel switches of early computers to correct problems. =Microsoft= Initially, Gates put Allchin in charge of revamping LAN Manager, using his networking expertise. However, Allchin scrapped the project, citing the need to start fresh. Allchin's first high-profile project at Microsoft was the Cairo technology, which was intended to add on to Windows NT to create the next version of the operating system. At the NT Developer Conference in July 1992, Allchin gave a presentation about the future Microsoft operating system. One of the main goals for Cairo was the ability for users to locate files based on their content as opposed to their name. Users would also have access to files stored on other machines on a network as easily as they had access to files on their own hard drives. Cairo was scheduled to ship as a single package in 1994. After several delays, it was finally released in pieces; the technology was shipped in successive operating system releases. The Cairo and Windows NT groups were combined, and Allchin created a new client and server organization focused on business and IT users. Allchin replaced Dave Cutler as the lead developer on Windows NT version 3.5 onwards. This led to conflict with Vice President Brad Silverberg, who was in charge of the development of Windows 95, the operating system which was aimed at the personal computer market as opposed to Windows NT's business computer market. In 1999, Microsoft re- organized its corporate structure. The Consumer Division, which maintained versions of Windows for home users and the Business & Enterprise Division, which maintained Windows NT, were combined into a single operating system division: the Platform Group. Allchin became the vice president of the new combined group. This promotion put him in charge of the development of both the home and business versions of Windows. With the release of Windows XP in 2001, both business and client versions of the operating system utilized the same code base. The server business grew substantially during this period of time. Allchin was diagnosed with cancer in late 2002 and took a leave of absence for part of 2003. Gates suggested that Allchin stay for a while. On September 20, 2005, Microsoft announced that Allchin would become co-president of a new Platform Products and Services Group, which combined the old Platform Group, Server and Tools Group, and the MSN Group. Microsoft also announced that Allchin would retire after Windows Vista shipped, leaving Kevin Johnson as the president. Allchin was a member of the Senior Leadership Team at Microsoft ‚Äì a small group responsible for developing Microsoft's core direction along with Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. He was claimed to be blunt, technical, and \\"straightforward.\\" Bill Gates complimented him: =Controversies= Running the most profitable product areas within Microsoft caused Allchin to be dragged in many controversies and disputes along with his business and technical leadership responsibilities. Brad Silverberg, the Microsoft executive, who had been responsible for Windows 95, emailed several people in Microsoft September 27, 1991: Jim Allchin replied: During the United States v. Microsoft antitrust trial, emails sent by Allchin to other Microsoft executives were considered as an evidence by the government lawyers to back up their claim that the integration of Internet Explorer and Windows had more to do with their competition with Netscape Communications Corporation than innovation. During the Caldera v. Microsoft case, emails from Allchin to Bill Gates were introduced as an evidence. One email, from September 1991, included Allchin telling Gates that \\"We need to slaughter Novell before they get stronger.\\" In August 1998, Allchin asked an engineer named Vinod Valloppillil to analyse the open source movement and the Linux operating system. Valloppillil wrote two memos which were intended for Senior Vice-President Paul Maritz who was the most senior executive at that time after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Both memos were leaked and popularly known as the Halloween documents. On September 29, 1998, Allchin was deposed to respond to the testimony of Professor Edward Felten. Later he testified in court from February 1 to 4, 1999. Some of his testimony were centered on the possibilities of removing Internet Explorer as stated by Felten. While Allchin proved his written testimony was correct in court, a video-taped demonstration created by Microsoft attorneys, which supposedly illustrated Allchin's points, was shown to be misleading. David Boies believed it was an avoidable mistake made by the Microsoft attorneys. In May 2002, Allchin testified before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly during the settlement hearing between Microsoft and the nine states (as well as the District of Columbia) involved in the United States v. Microsoft antitrust trial. Allchin was called to testify on two issues, the first of which gained the most publicity. In relation to the issue of sharing technical API and protocol information used throughout Microsoft products, which the states were seeking, Allchin's testimony discussed how releasing certain information could increase the security risk to consumers. According to exhibits filed in 2006 by the plaintiff in the case of Comes v. Microsoft, Allchin wrote a memo to Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer in January 2004, one which was critical of Microsoft and Longhorn. The letter said that Gates and Ballmer had lost their way and compared them to Apple who he believed had not. Allchin was also critical of Microsoft relaxing its requirements for computers to carry the 'Vista Capable' badge. The seal, designed to inform customers of a computer's ability to run the Windows Vista operating system, was not initially intended for computers running Intel's 915 chipset. This was overturned, however, after Intel voiced their dissatisfaction with the decision. In an email to Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, Allchin wrote: =Post-Microsoft career= Today, Allchin devotes his time to music, technology, and charity work. He released his first album, Enigma, in 2009 calling the album a beta test. Then in September 2011, Allchin released his first widely distributed blues-themed album: Overclocked. The album Q.E.D. was released in September 2013 and Decisions followed in June 2017. Prime Blues, his latest album is scheduled to be released September 2018. Overclocked, Q.E.D., and Decisions all received widespread acclaim especially for Allchin's guitar work. Overclocked, Q.E.D., and Decisions were featured on iTunes as New and Noteworthy and all reached in the top 10 on Internet Blues Radio. Decisions was the #1 Blues Album in Washington State for 18 weeks starting in June, 2017. And Decisions was in the 10 top Blues Rocks album nationally for 14 weeks.

The first Steel appeared in Steel, The Indestructible Man #1 (1978), and was created by Gerry Conway and Don Heck. His stories were set in World War II. The two later characters called Steel are his grandsons. Nate Heywood / Steel appears in the Arrowverse show Legends of Tomorrow, starting from the second season, portrayed by Nick Zano, while his grandfather Henry Heywood / Commander Steel was portrayed by Matthew MacCaull. Nate‚Äôs father Hank Heywood was portrayed by Tom Wilson. Publishing history Steel first appeared in a series set in 1939, Steel: The Indestructible Man, written by Captain America writer Gerry Conway. The series was canceled after five issues, and Steel later made a guest-appearance in Justice League of America. Steel was also a member of the World War II era All-Star Squadron team. He made a prominent appearance many years later in four issues of the Eclipso ongoing series, where he was killed. After this, he appeared in issue #2 of the 2010 series, DC Universe: Legacies, which chronicled the superheroes of the 1940s. Starting in 1984, the second Steel appeared as one of the lead characters in Justice League of America,Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 209: \\"The prestigious Justice League of America got a bit easier to join, thanks to writer Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Patton. Marking the debut of camouflaging hero Gypsy, the shockwave-casting Vibe, and the second generation hero Steel, this landmark comic saw many of the more famous League members step down in order to make way for a younger roster to carry on their legacy. until its cancellation during the Legends crossover in 1987. He made a single appearance several years later in issue #38 of Justice League America, a continuation of Justice League International, where he was killed. In 2006, he played a leading posthumous role in a single story arc of JLA Classified, which chronicled a previously unrevealed adventure of the Detroit-era JLA. In 2010, he played a major role in the two-issue Justice League of America vol. 2 tie-in to Blackest Night, where he was temporarily resurrected. The third Steel made his debut in the 2007 relaunch of Justice Society of America, where he appeared for several years until the team was split into two separate groups by writers Bill Willingham and Matt Sturges, where he appeared as one of the lead characters in JSA All-Stars. In 2011's The New 52 reboot of DC's continuity, he is shown to exist on Earth 2, under the name Captain Steel. Fictional character biography =Henry Heywood= Steel, The Indestructible Man #1 (March 1978). Pencilled by Don Heck and inked by Al Milgrom. The World War II version of the character, Henry Heywood, enlisted in the United States Marine Corps prior to the United States involvement in the war, but was injured when saboteurs, spearheaded by the man who would become Baron Blitzkrieg, attacked his base. Heywood had been a biology student under the tutelage of Doctor Gilbert Giles, and his former professor performed extensive surgery on him, enhancing his damaged body with mechanized steel devices that gave him superhuman strength, speed, and durability. At the request of Doctor Giles, Heywood kept his newfound gifts a secret, and was returned to service in a desk position. Frustrated at his inability to help more directly, Heywood adopted the masked-hero persona \\"Steel\\", and was attempting to steal armaments from the military base where he worked‚Äîto send to those more directly in the war's fray‚Äîwhen some fifth columnist saboteurs broke into the base. Heywood defeated the saboteurs, and embarked on a career fighting foreign threats and other criminals before America went to war. Heywood entered more directly into World War II as a secret weapon before he allied himself with the All-Star Squadron. In that time he was commissioned Commander Steel by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His membership in the Squadron was only for a brief period as Crisis on Infinite Earths caused him to shift from his native Earth-Two to Earth-One, which later became the Post-Crisis Earth. Hank retired from his superhero career, as there were no active costumed heroes at that time on his new home. Years later, as a wealthy industrialist, he incorporated the same mechanized components into his grandson, Hank Haywood III. He financed the Detroit version of the Justice League and gave them his best worker, Dale Gunn, to serve as this version of the JLA's all purpose man. When he realized that this new League didn't adhere to his now narrow beliefs, he enlisted Infinity Inc. to help him defeat them so that he could \\"straighten Hank out.\\" The plan failed, and Hank suffered the indignity of being beaten by his grandson in hand-to-hand combat. They were estranged from that point on. He was there, however, to try to save young Hank's life after a vicious attack by Dr. Ivo left him broken. He couldn't save his grandson though; all he could do was be with him when they turned off his life support. After his grandson's death, Heywood resumed the mantle of Commander Steel and died battling the supervillain Eclipso, while a member of the Shadow Fighters. He did come to a heroic end - detonating the Sunburst 300 (a device meant to destroy Eclipso) as his teammate Nemesis escaped. During the \\"Heroes in Crisis\\" storyline, Commander Steel checked into Sanctuary to deal with the trauma of deaths. He was among the heroes who was killed in a blast.Heroes in Crisis #1. DC Comics. While doing an autopsy, Batman found Joker Teeth in his throat.Heroes in Crisis #5. DC Comics. =Hank Heywood III= Hank Heywood III as the second Steel. Art by Tom Derenick. The second Steel was the late Henry \\"Hank\\" Heywood III. Commander Steel, a wealthy industrialist, incorporated the same mechanized components into his grandson, much to his grandson's disapproval. Heywood III was a \\"Justice League Detroit\\" team member, and was mortally wounded in battle against an android belonging to one of the team's classic foes, Professor Ivo. His body remained preserved in the JLA Bunker until it was discovered and destroyed by Despero. Although it was originally stated that Heywood performed unnecessary surgeries on his grandson, it was later revealed in Justice League of America #260 that if he hadn't made his grandson into Steel, \\"Hank would have been dead... years ago.\\" Hank later remarked that his grandfather may have been driven insane by the metal in his skull.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #40 In a Justice League of America tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover, Steel was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps in the Hall of Justice.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009) Alongside the Black Lantern Vibe, Steel attacked his former teammates, Gypsy and Vixen, until Doctor Light destroyed him.Justice League of America (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009) During a later battle between the Justice League and Crime Syndicate of America at the Hall of Justice, Steel's remains were destroyed by Superwoman. The villainess even went so far as to use one of Steel's severed legs as a club, which she proceeded to use to bludgeon Donna Troy.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #51 =Nathan Heywood= Nathan Heywood as Citizen Steel on the cover of Justice Society of America #7 (September 2007). Art by Alex Ross. The relaunched Justice Society of America features another member of the Heywood family. During an interview to Newsarama, new series writer Geoff Johns announced him as a brand new character with new powers. He debuted in Justice Society of America #2 with the name of Nathan \\"Buckeye\\" Heywood. Nathan is the grandson of Henry Heywood and cousin of Henry Heywood III. Formerly a football star at the Ohio State University, Nathan retired after shattering his kneecap and having his leg amputated due to an undiagnosed infection. The incident left Nathan addicted to painkillers. While attending a Heywood family reunion, he is attacked by the Fourth Reich, a team of metahuman Neo-Nazis ordered by Vandal Savage to wipe out the bloodlines of Golden Age heroes. The Fourth Reich fails to completely destroy the Heywood bloodline, as both Nathan and a few children manage to survive. Both Nathan's brother and mother are turned to metal statues by the villain Reichsmark. Nathan jams his crutch into Reichsmark's mouth, causing him to spit liquid metal blood onto Nathan. Hawkman takes him to Dr. Mid-Nite, who notes that the metal is being absorbed by Nathan's skin. Nathan's brother and mother, in their metal forms, are moved to the rooftop of the JSA brownstone.JSA 80 Page Giant #1 (Jan. 2010) Later, it is revealed that the metal has grown out from where Nathan's amputated leg once was, forming metallic bone, muscles, and flesh. Waking in his hospital room, Nathan is shown to have superhuman strength. Dr. Mid-Nite informs Nathan that he is now a being of living steel, due to an unknown reaction to Reichsmark's blood. However, the steel tissues do not give Nathan tactile response, meaning he cannot feel textures or temperatures, nor gauge exerted pressures, and his weight has greatly increased, causing his footsteps to crack the ground. He is given a costume, a \\"second skin\\" of a stainless steel alloy developed by Dr. Mid-Nite and Mr. Terrific specifically to restrict his movements and reduce his strength to a more manageable level. They chose the costume's colors because of Heywood's heritage. He then joins the Justice Society to defeat the Fourth Reich. Afterwards, the press asks if he is the new Commander Steel. Nathan denies it, saying that he is just an ordinary citizen, so he is called \\"Citizen Steel\\" by Power Girl. When the Third World survivor Gog appears, Nathan is one of the JSA members who sides with him, hoping that Gog can restore his sense of touch.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #19 It is later revealed that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, which would cause its destruction if he ever left, and when the unconverted JSAers battle him, they are blown away by winds created by Gog. Nathan alone is able to withstand the winds. Gog offers Nathan his greatest wishes fulfilled if he sides with him and worships him, but Nathan refuses, and joins the fight against him. For this act, Gog induces excruciating pain in Nathan.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #21 Nathan then tears off his suit and unleashes his full strength against Gog, actually managing to topple the giant, which gives Gog's former herald Magog the chance to cut off his head and send him to the Source Wall.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #22 Following Gog's defeat, Nathan takes time off from the JSA to be with his family. This consists of survivors of the attack on the reunion, various children, most of whom call him 'Uncle Nathan'Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #23 or 'Uncle Nate'.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #9 During the events of Blackest Night, Nathan helps fight off the hordes of Black Lanterns attacking Manhattan. He tries to help Power Girl during her battle with the newly reanimated Kal-L, but is knocked aside by the hero, who mockingly refers to him as a \\"paperweight\\" compared to him.Blackest Night: JSA #3 Following the split in the Justice Society, Nathan opted to join Power Girl's more youth-oriented team of JSA All-Stars.JSA All- Stars #1 =Hank Heywood Jr.= In September 2011, DC Comics cancelled and relaunched its entire line of monthly comics, in an initiative called The New 52, and in so doing, rebooted the continuity the DC Universe. In this new timeline, Hank Heywood Jr. appears as Captain Steel in title, Earth-2. The modern version of Hank is revealed to be a young Filipino man. It is stated that Hank was originally a young boy born with a degenerative bone disorder that would have killed him by his 18th birthday, and that his father replaced all of his bones with an experimental metal to save his life (although it also made him unable to feel emotion). During Darkseid's invasion of Earth-2, Hank's father killed himself and destroyed his research in order to prevent the Parademons from getting their hands on it.Earth-2 #13 He is among those who managed to escaped the Apokolips Invasion in the following series Earth-2: World's End and found sanctuary in a newly terraformed Earth-like planet (nicknamed Earth 2) following some of their Wonders actions during the Convergence event. In Earth 2: Society, he is a member of the World Army cabinet working to maintain peace amongst the new cities of Earth 2.Earth 2: Society #8 In hopes of preventing war from happening between two cities, Erebus and Ark Home, Hank is granted full military suppression by Commander Sato to any hostiles of both parties. Steel is blocked by The Flash, Power Girl, and Huntress. Following a small argument, the conflict is ended as Green Lantern re-purposes his power ring to become Earth 2's energy supply.Earth 2: Society #12 Steel is among those who come into conflict with Fury and Aquawoman following the Amazonian's suggestion to use an artifact known as the Pandora Vessel to recreate the Earth back to its original state.Earth 2: Society #13 The World Army cabinet is attacked by Ultra-Humanite's soldiers and Steel is gravely injured by a metahuman named Scalpel. Flash rescues Steel and sends him to a nearby medical team, however upon the speedsters's return to his friends, he announces Hank's nearing death, upsetting the group.Earth 2: Society #14 =Sergeant Steel= Following a brief encounter with Ultra- Humanite, Fury opens the Pandora Vessel as a last resort in saving the Wonders with Earth-2 being recreated once again.Earth 2: Society #15 Following the completion of the recreation, Earth 2 returns to its original state, however it never had a history of Wonders protecting it and Sandmen soldiers keeping everything in check 24/7. An unidentified man sporting Steel's color appears before Huntress, Batman, and John Grayson.Earth 2: Society #18 This man is identified as Sergeant Steel and is the first and last member of a super soldier program called Americommando. He is the leader of an underground movement of concerned citizens and ex-servicemen hoping to build up strength to fight back. He takes in the three Wonders in hopes that The Movement can finally strike.Earth 2: Society #19 After the Ultra-Humanite incident, Sergeant Steel joins the Wonders in protecting their new Earth.Earth 2: Society #22 Powers and abilities Originally Commander Steel could lift 1,000 pounds, but when he appeared in the pages of the All-Star Squadron, he was attributed 'super-human' strength without an exact limit. Citizen Steel's metallic body grants him superhuman strength and allows him to take direct blows from opponents as powerful as Gog, and remain standing, and in turn knocking him to the ground‚Äîthe only one in the JSA able to do so‚Äîbut at the cost of reducing his sense of touch so that he cannot really feel anything he comes in contact with, making it hard for him to judge how much effort he should put into doing things. His alloy suit limits his strength to controllable levels but at a cost of slowing him down, as well as making him so heavy that he has been shown cracking pavements just by walking. Upon removing his suit, he is able to unleash his full strength without a speed penalty. In other media =Television= Live-action * Dr. Nathaniel \\"Nate\\" Heywood / Steel appears in Legends of Tomorrow, starting from the second season, portrayed by Nick Zano, while his grandfather Henry Heywood I / Commander Steel is portrayed by Matthew MacCaull. Initially a hemophiliac, he is injected with a super serum provided to the Nazis by Eobard Thawne after it is modified by Dr. Ray Palmer, turning Nate into a metahuman with an ability to transform himself into a steel-like form in addition providing him superhuman strength. Having obtained his powers, Nate starts calling himself \\"Steel\\", although one of his original suggestions is \\"Citizen Steel\\". It's later revealed by Obsidian to Nate that his grandfather went on a mission with his team excluding himself, and never returned home in 1956, a year after Nate's own father was born. Nate gained his own Steel suit at the end of the episode \\"Outlaw Country\\". In the episode \\"Raiders of the Lost Art\\" it's shown that Nate became a historian because as a child he saw the Indiana Jones series, with a temporal aberration nearly causing Nate to become a yoga instructor because George Lucas abandoned filmmaking after an attack. In \\"Moonshot,\\" Commander Steel is revealed to be in 1970, becoming a flight commander for NASA and one of the guardians of the fragments of the Spear of Destiny, which he managed to hide on the moon. He also rigged a competition to let his then-teenage son, Hank Heywood come to NASA so he could hopefully meet him. Henry though later sacrifices himself by opening up the hatch doors to the Waverider to save the Legends and was sucked into space. Afterwards, Nate passes on a message that Henry left to the young Hank and gave him his father's dogtags, which he would eventually pass down to Nate someday. ** Henry \\"Hank\\" Heywood II appears in the fourth season of Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson. He is the father of Nate Heywood, the son of Henry Heywood and the primary funder of the Time Bureau, where the Legends are employed. He is unaware that his son is a superhero until the episode \\"Witch Hunt\\". Secretly, he works with the demon Neron in capturing mystical creatures that escaped from Mallus' Realm. After making amends with his son, Hank attempts to break off the relationship with Neron in favor of working alongside the Legends, but is killed by the demon instead. Following his death, Nate discovers that Hank was actually trying to train the magical creatures for a theme park named \\"Heyworld\\", based on a drawing Nate had made when he was nine years old, believing it could unify the country. The Legends go on to realize his dream. After Constantine tricks Neron into killing Nate, Hank's ghost meets up with Nate's ghost stating how proud he is of him starting Heyworld. While stating that he loves his son, Hank gives Nate the push needed to bring him back to life. Animation Commander Steel in Justice League Unlimited in the series finale episode \\"Destroyer\\". *Hank Heywood III appeared several times as Steel in the Justice League Unlimited series, but his character never spoke any dialogue. A Mattel action figure in the character's likeness (called \\"Commander\\" Steel to presumably differentiate him from the better known, current version of Steel, already a figure in the toyline) was released. In the series finale episode, \\"Destroyer\\", he saved Hawkgirl from being killed by a Parademon by throwing a shield at it in reference to Captain America (who shares some similarities with Commander Steel). Also in \\"Destroyer\\", he is seen running down the Metro Tower stairs with Vibe, Vixen, and Gypsy, the four members of the Justice League Detroit era created by Gerry Conway. * In Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Powerless\\", he is referred to as Aquaman sings his rousing song of heroism he appears as Commander Steel as one of the heroes. =Toys= *The original Commander Steel, Henry Heywood, was the first figure released in the eighth wave of the DC Universe Classics line. *Commander Steel was also released through the Mattel Justice League Unlimited line, coming in a six-pack with Superman, Crimson Fox, B'Wanna Beast, Deadman, and Vibe.

Mamzer status () is not synonymous with illegitimacy, since it does not include children whose mothers were unmarried.Mishnah Yebamot 4:13; Babylonian Talmud, Yebamot 49a Definition =Etymology= Some have explained the word mamzer as the masculine noun form derived from the root m-z-r, having a meaning of spoilt/corrupt.Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, Charles Augustus Briggs, Edward Robinson, James Strong, Wilhelm Gesenius, The Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew and English lexicon: with an appendix containing the Biblical Aramaic : coded with the numbering system from Strong's Exhaustive concordance of the Bible, Hendrickson Publishers, 2005 According to Strong's Concordance: \\"from an unused root meaning 'to alienate'; a mongrel, i.e., born of a Jewish father and a heathen mother\\".Strong‚Äôs Concordance: #4464 The Talmud explains the term homiletically as consisting of the words mum (defect) and zar (strange/alien), a euphemism for an illicit union in the person's lineage.Yevamot 76b =Hebrew Bible usage= The term occurs twice in the Hebrew Bible. The first time is (23:2 in non-Hebrew versions). The Septuagint translates the term mamzer as son \\"of a prostitute\\" (Greek: '),Deuteronomy 23:2-4, LXX and the Latin Vulgate translates it as ' (\\"born of a prostitute\\").Augustin Calmet, Dictionary of the Holy Bible 1837 English edition p. 151 Charles Taylor, Edward Robinson editors: \\"But the Vulgate, the LXX, and the authors of the canon law, take the Hebrew mamzer, (Deut xxiii. 2.) for the child of a prostitute; while some interpreters take it for a generic term, which signifies illegitimate children\\" In English, it is translated as \\"bastard\\". :(\\"shall not enter the congregation of the Lord,\\" Explained by the Rabbis to mean that the bastard cannot marry a son or daughter of Israel)Shulhan Arukh, Eben ha-Ezer 4:1‚Äìff. The other occasion is in : \\"And a bastard (mamzer) shall dwell in Ashdod\\", a sea port. =Halakhic definitions= In the Talmud the term mamzer is applied to the descendants of specific illicit unions. According to the Mishnah, a mamzer is the offspring of a biblically forbidden union for which his progenitors are liable to extirpation at the hands of heaven.Yevamot 4, Mishnah 13: \\"\\" An exception to this rule is when a Jewish man cohabits with a menstruant woman, which although he is liable thereby to extirpation, the child born from such union is not a mamzer. The practical bearing of this ruling is that it excludes from such defamation a child born outside of wedlock, and which child is often wrongly called \\"bastard\\" under common law. According to the Shulchan Aruch, a mamzer can only be produced by two Jews.Shulchan Aruch, \\"Even haEzer\\" 4:19 There are two categories of mamzerim. A child born of incest as defined by the Bible is a mamzer. Note, however, that an incestuous relationship between one or two non-Jews cannot produce a mamzer, and if the product of such a union were to convert he or she would be the equal of any Jew.Shulchan Aruch, \\"Even haEzer\\" 4:21 Nathan confronts King David for his adultery with Bathsheba, an affair that produced a mamzer. Bronze bas-relief on the door of La Madeleine, Paris. A child born of a married woman's adultery is a mamzer. The child of a single woman and a man she could lawfully have married is not a mamzer.Shulchan Aruch Even haEzer 4 It is irrelevant if the man is married or not. If one of the parents is not Jewish the child is not a mamzer. Any child born to a married woman, even if she is known to have been unfaithful, is presumed to be her husband's, unless she is so promiscuous that such a presumption becomes unsupportable,Shulchan Aruch, \\"Even haEzer\\" 4:15 or if she enters a public relationship with another man.Shulchan Aruch, \\"Even haEzer\\" 4:16 A child born within 12 months of a woman's most recent meeting with her husband is presumed to be legitimate, since Jewish law believes that in rare cases a pregnancy can last that long.4:14 However, if more than 9 months have elapsed and she is known to have been unfaithful then the presumption does not apply.Even haEzer Rama 4:14 Modern assisted reproductive technology has complicated the issue. Moshe Feinstein ruled that if a married woman is inseminated by sperm from another man the child is not a mamzer, since it did not result from an act of adultery; Joel Teitelbaum (2005) disagreed, and ruled that since the child is known to be that of a man other than her husband it is a mamzer. The status of an abandoned child (Hebrew: asufi) was determined by the state in which it was found. If there were indications that the foundling had been abandoned due to the parents being unable to support it, then Halakhically the child would not be a mamzer. However, if the unknown parents could have supported the child, it was regarded as potentially being a mamzer. A child whose mother is known, but not the father, was known as \\"silent one\\" (Hebrew: shetuki), and fell into the same category as a foundling; this status, however, could be changed if the mother knew and revealed the identity of the father. The mamzer status is hereditary ‚Äì a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards Jewish status as only transmitted through the mother, the child of a male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. However, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is a mamzer.\\"Shulchan Aruch, \\"Even haEzer\\" 4:19 Marriage restrictions The biblical rule against certain people becoming part of the \\"congregation of the Lord\\" (verses 1-3 in some English translations) was interpreted in the Talmud as a prohibition against ordinary Jews marrying such people. Although the biblical passage includes in this up to the tenth generation of the descendants of a mamzer, classical rabbis interpreted this as an idiom meaning \\"forever\\". Thus, in traditional Jewish law, a mamzer and his or her descendants are not allowed to marry an ordinary (non-mamzer) Jewish spouse. The restriction does not prevent a mamzer from marrying another mamzer, nor from marrying a convert to Judaism, or a non-Jewish slave. However, foundlings suspected of being mamzerim were not so free; they were neither permitted to marry a mamzer, nor even to marry another foundling. Social status of mamzerim Although in many historical societies, illegitimacy of birth was a quality which could make a person somewhat of an outcast, this was not the official attitude of Judaism; apart from the marriage restrictions, a mamzer is not officially considered a second-class citizen, and is supposed to be treated with as much respect as other Jews. For example, the Mishnah teaches that a learned mamzer should \\"take precedence\\" over an ignorant High Priest of Israel;Horayot 3:8 the meaning of \\"take precedence\\" is not explicitly explained by the Mishnah, nor by the Talmud in general, although the preceding part of the Mishnah uses it to refer to the priority in which people should be rescued from danger, while other bits of the Mishnah use the phrase to refer to the priority in which people should receive aliyot.Rabbi Ellie Kaplan Spitz, Mamzerut, Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, EH 4.2000a, pp. 5587-585. Rabbis in the Talmud, and those in the Middle Ages, saw fit to spell out that, aside from in questions of marriage, a mamzer should be treated as an ordinary Jew. The Talmud insists that a mamzer should be considered as an ordinary relative for the purpose of inheritance,Yevamot 22b including levirate marriage.Yevamot 22a Maimonides and Joseph ben Ephraim Karo see fit to repeat this,Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Mispatim ‚Äì Laws of inheritance ‚Äì 1:11Joseph Karo, Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 276:6 and confirm that a mamzer can serve as a judge.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Shoftim ‚Äì Sanhedrin ‚Äì 2:9Joseph Karo, Shulkhan Arukh, Hoshen Mishpat 7:2 Similarly, a tosafa insists that it is permissible for a mamzer to become a king.Talmud, Yavamot 45b Tosefot Modern investigations into mamzer status =Orthodox Judaism= The principal approach in Orthodox Judaism is to require strict evidentiary standards for mamzer status, sufficiently strict that proof of the existence of mamzer status is hard to develop and generally does not arise. Typically it is impossible to prove either that a prior marriage ever existed, or that a child was born of relations outside that marriage. Rabbis always allow the suspect child the benefit of the doubt in this matter. This usually leads to the conclusion that at the time of a person's birth, their parents were married or that the person is the child of a man and woman who were married to each other when the child was conceived. An example is a contemporary responsum by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, establishing the impossibility to prove mamzer status in a case where the evidence might appear to be clear-cut.Shut Yabia Omer, part 7, Even haEzer 6; addressed to Rabbi Grubner of Detroit, Michigan The case involved the daughter of an aguna who had been married by a Haredi rabbi to a husband who subsequently converted to Christianity and refused to participate in a Jewish divorce. The mother eventually divorced and remarried civilly and had the daughter years later. The daughter, who had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and attended a Haredi day school, brought up the question of her status herself prior to an impending marriage. Rabbi Yosef proceeded systematically to disqualify evidence that a prior marriage had ever taken place. The mother's evidence was immediately disqualified as an interested party. The ketubah (Jewish marriage contract/certificate) was never found. The rabbi who performed the marriage was contacted, but Rabbi Yosef wrote that his testimony could not be accepted without the ketubah, and in any event required corroboration by a second witness. Attempts to contact the husband were abandoned after an adversarial conversation with his new, non- Jewish wife. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded there was insufficient evidence that a valid prior marriage had ever taken place. Rabbi Yosef then proceeded to establish the possibility that the former husband might be the daughter's father. The mother testified that her former husband occasionally brought alimony payments and came for visitation in person and hence the two were sometimes at least momentarily alone together. Applying an ancient rule that when a husband and wife are known to be alone together behind a closed door the law presumes sexual intercourse may well have taken place, Rabbi Yosef concluded that it was possible the former husband was the daughter's father and hence Jewish law, which very strongly construes all evidence in favour of birth within marriage, had to presume that he was. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded that there was insufficient evidence of either a former marriage or that the new husband was the father, and hence he concluded that no evidence of mamzerut had occurred. Conservative rabbi Daniel S. Nevins, commenting on this case, noted that the box of traditional tools Rabbi Yosef used to discredit evidence of mamzer status may be sufficiently robust as to cover virtually all cases of inquiry in the types of situations a congregation rabbi would be likely to experience.Rabbi Daniel S. Nevins, A Concurring Opinion Regarding Mamzerut, Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, EH 4.2000b, pp. 587-592 Nonetheless, Orthodox authorities hold that while contemporary rabbis have authority to refine procedural rules such as rules of evidence, they do not have the authority to abolish biblically mandated categories or procedures entirely. Israeli law tries to prevent the conferring of mamzer status by refusing to allow men other than the husband or recent ex-husband from registering as a child's father without a court order.http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/when-the-child-falls- through-a-loophole-in-jewish-law-1.42178 However, paternity tests have the potential to reveal mamzer status by removing the protection of the presumption of paternity on the part of a married woman's actual husband.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/138511 =Conservative Judaism= The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism has declared that Conservative Rabbis should not inquire into or accept evidence of mamzer status under any circumstances, rendering the category inoperative. In doing so, the CJLS distinguished the Conservative approach to Jewish law from the Orthodox approach, noting that Conservative Judaism regards Biblical law as only the beginning of a relationship rather than a final word, and that the Conservative movement regards it as its role and responsibility to revise Biblical law from time to time when such law conflicts with evolving concepts of morality. =Karaite Judaism= In Zechariah 9:6, \\"mamzer\\" is referenced similar to that of the nations of Ammon, Moab, Edom, Egypt, Tyre, Zidon, Ashkelon, Gaza, Philistia, etc. From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew to actually refer to a nation of people. Karaites believe that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, and several Medieval rabbinical Jewish sages felt it necessary to debate this topic with medieval Karaite Jewish sages.Abraham ibn Ezra Commentary on Zechariah ix. 6. See also Kimhi same. In Israeli law In the modern State of Israel, the law concerning matters of marriage, divorce, and personal status, is partially under the jurisdiction of religious courts. For example, there is no civil marriage in Israel. The Jewish religious regulations concerning mamzerim are thus also the national laws imposed on Jews living in Israel, including secular Jews. Because of the severe impediments to marriage which mamzer status accords in Jewish law, Israeli civil law has taken the position that the paternity of a child born within a marriage cannot legally be challenged in civil courts, in order to avoid creating a body of evidence that might be used to declare the child a mamzer, or create difficulties for a future marriage. The existence of mamzer status as a category in Israeli family law has been criticized. An extensive review and opinion advocating the adoption of civil marriage in Israel, written by Prof. Pinhas Shifman and published in July 2001 by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, mentions Mamzer among the categories of Israelis which, Professor Shifman believes, should have the right to marry spouses of their choice and, he argues, current Israeli law interferes with and denies this right. Professor Shifman and ACRI advocate ending the religious monopoly over marriage in Israel and cite the existence and difficulties of mamzer status as an argument against the use of religious law in marriage cases. Israeli religious courts resolve mamzer status by generally ruling that the child was born within the marriage despite the existence of evidence to the contrary. This convenient formula sometimes causes difficulties for lovers or subsequent spouses who wish to assert paternity over a child which may be biologically theirs. A 2006 case, in which a child born eight months and two weeks after a divorce, was declared the former husband's child rather than the child of the wife's subsequent husband, and this was reported as causing a dilemma for the subsequent couple. Nonetheless, the existence of the category of Mamzer, and the marital impediments inherent to it, is one of the arguments frequently used by Israeli secularists in calling for separation of religion and state and for the institution of civil marriage. In 2014 the Center for Women's Justice announced it would petition the Israeli Supreme Court to bar secret blacklists of mamzerim by Orthodox rabbinical courts, claiming they are an invasion of privacy.Ben Sales. \\"Barring ‚Äòbastards‚Äô: Israel‚Äôs marriage blacklist said to break privacy laws\\". Connection with French medieval nicknames A persistent etymology of the surname Manser is connected to Hebrew mamzer.Louis Isaac Rabinowitz (1938). The social life of the Jews of northern France in the XII-XIV centuries. \\"Yet we have not come across a single instance of an illegitimate child or a child born of incest (Mamzer) and there was even and there was even a Takkanah against a man calling another a Mamzer or illegitimate.... See Loewe, 11, note 9026 for the suggestion that the common name among English Jews \\"Manser\\" is derived ...\\" Supposedly Ebalus of Aquitaine (Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine, c. 870 - 935) had the nickname \\"Manzer\\" or \\"Manser\\". As he is known to have been a bastard and reputed to have had a Jewish mother, this nickname is considered to be derived from mamzer. A similar explanation is offered also for the same nickname as used by another prince from Occitania: , a 10th-century count of Angoul√™me who also was a bastard. William the Conqueror may have been referred to as Bastardus and Mamzer.Edward Augustus Freeman. The History of the Norman Conquest of England: The reign of Eadward the Confessor.

He was born when Lord Shiva open his third eye to destroy Indra for his arrogance. However, Indra was saved and the energy emitted from the eye was sent into ocean. The energy later developed into a baby boy and was raised by Varuna and later, Shukracharya (Guru of Asuras). When he grew up, he conquered the three realms - Swarga (heaven), Bhuloka (earth) and Patala (hell). He married Vrinda, a pious lady. Later, Shiva slayed him for his evil deeds.  Birth In the Shiva Purana, when Indra and Brihaspati were going towards Mount Kailash to meet Shiva their way was blocked by a yogi with matted hair and a radiant face. The yogi was Shiva himself, who had taken the form to test the knowledge of Indra and Brihaspati. Indra did not recognize the yogi and was infuriated at the fact that the man was not moving out of their way. Indra asked him to move but the man did not budge. After not getting any reply Indra became enraged and threatened him with his thunderbolt. Upon this action Indra's arm became paralyzed and Shiva neutralized the thunderbolt. Shiva became angry upon this action of Indra and his eyes turned red, frightening Indra. The anger caused Third eye to open, nearly killing Indra. Brihaspati recognized Shiva and prayed to him, requesting him to pardon Indra. To avoid killing Indra, Shiva sent the fire from his eye towards the ocean and upon meeting with the ocean it assumed the form of a boy. The boy cried terribly which caused Brahma to descend from heaven. The ocean told Brahma that he did not know where the boy came from. Brahma then told him that the boy will one day become the emperor of Asuras, he could only be killed by Shiva and after his death he would return to Third eye. Jalandhara, The Emperor of the Three Realms Jalandhara's childhood was full of wonders. Borne up by the wind, he flew over the ocean; his pets were lions which he had caught; and the largest birds and fishes were subject to him.http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/hmvp/hmvp43.htm Jalandhara grew up to be a handsome man and was made the emperor of Asuras by Shukra, their guru. Jalandhara was exceedingly powerful and is considered to be one of the mightiest asuras of all time. He married Vrinda, the daughter of the Asura Kalanemi. Jalandhara ruled with justice and nobility. One day sage Bhrigu came to meet Jalandhara. He narrated the tales of Hiranyakashipu and Virochana. He also tells him how Vishnu severed Rahu's head and about the Samudra manthan. Jalandhara resented the Samudra manthan. He believed that the Devas had treacherously taken his father, Varuna's treasures. He sent one of his messengers, Ghasmar, to Indra to ask him to return his father's treasures. However Indra refused to do so. A fierce battle took place between the Devas and Asuras. Many warriors were killed on both sides. Shukra revived the Asuras using his Mritsanjivani vidya. Brihaspati revived the dead Devas by using the medicinal herbs from the Drongiri mountain. Shukra ordered Jalandhara to submerge the mountain so Brihaspati cannot use the medicinal herbs to revive the Devas. Jalandhara obeyed the command and submerged Drongiri mountain. Demoralized, the Devas requested Vishnu for his aid. Vishnu agreed but promised Lakshmi that he would not kill Jalandhara since he was born out of the ocean and Lakshmi considered him as her brother. A fierce battle was fought between Jalandhara during which Lord Vishnu overpowered Jalandhar and was about to behead Jalandhar with his divine sword, Nandak when Lakshmi intervened and prohibited Lord Vishnu from killing him. Vishnu was impressed by Jalandhara's valiance in battle and told him about Lakshmi's relationship with him. Vishnu then asked him to demand any boon he desired. Jalandhara asked Vishnu to make Ksheera Sagara his home. He agreed and started living there along with Lakshmi. Without his help the Devas were defeated by Asuras and Jalandhara became the emperor of the three worlds (heaven, earth and hell).http://hinduonline.co/Scriptures/Puranas/ShivaMahaPurana.html Conflict with Lord Shiva The Devas were unhappy about their defeat. They did not wish to be ruled by Jalandhara despite the fact that he was the creation of Shiva. The sage Narada upon consulting with the Devas went to see Jalandhara. On being asked the purpose of his visit by Jalandhara he described the beauty of Kailash where Shiva lived and that he wondered whether any other place matched its beauty. In response, Jalandhara showed off his riches to Narada who commented that he did not have the most beautiful woman as his wife. Narada then continued to describe Shiva's residence and also described to him about Parvati's beauty. Jalandhara sends his messenger Rahu to Shiva and accuses him of hypocrisy, pointing out that Shiva claims to be an ascetic but keeps a wife, Parvati. He proposes that Shiva hand over Parvati to him: > How can you live on alms and yet keep the beautiful Parvati? Give her to me, > and wander from house to house with your alms bowl. You have fallen from > your vow. You are a yogi, what need have you for the gem of wives? You live > in the woods attended by goblins and ghosts; being a naked yogi, you should > give your wife to one who will appreciate her better than you do.Wendy > Doniger O'Flaherty, \\"Asceticism and Sexuality in the Mythology of Siva, Part > II.\\" History of Religions, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Aug., 1969), pp. 1‚Äì41. Upon hearing these insults, Shiva became so angry that a fearsome creature (Kƒ´rttimukha) sprang from his brow and nearly killed Rahu, the messenger who had delivered the demand. War being determined on, Jalandhara marched first to Kailash; but finding that Shiva had forsaken it and taken up a position on a mountain near Lake Manasa, he surrounded the mountain with his troops. Nandi marched against them, and spread destruction; however, the army of the gods suffered many losses. Parvati then urged Shiva to enter the war. Shiva carefully warned Parvati to be on her guard during his absence, as it was possible asuras in some disguise might visit her; after this, accompanied by Virabhadra and Manibhadra, two forms of his anger, Shiva went to the battlefield. Kartikeya came to fight with him, but was defeated. After his defeat, Ganesha tried to dominate over him, but was badly defeated by him and was left unconscious on the battlefield. Upon seeing Shiva and his avatars dominate the battlefield, Jalandhara created an illusion of beautiful apsaras singing and dancing. This distracted his army but not himself. Meanwhile, Jalandhara disguised himself as Shiva and went to Parvati in order to trick her. Parvati recognized him and became very angry. Puranas states that on recognizing this deception, Parvati was so enraged that her eyes turned blood red and her face, pitch black indicating her assumption of her form of Kali. She attempted to attack him but Jalandhara escaped knowing he was no match for the goddess's anger. Parvati then went to Vishnu and requested him to trick Vrinda just like Jalandhara tried to trick her. Vrinda's Curse Jalandhara's wife Vrinda was very pious. First, Vishnu created an illusion that Jalandhara had been killed by Shiva and is then restored to life by him. Vrinda then embraces Jalandhara who is actually Vishnu in disguise. Vrinda realizes that it is Vishnu in disguise and curses him that someday someone would trick his own wife (which becomes true when Sita is kidnapped by Ravana) just like how he had tricked her as a result of which the world will raise a finger on his wife's purity and he would be helpless against the onslaught, for having ruined her chastity. She adds that he will bear the pain of separation from his wife, similar to her husband. She also admonishes him for being stone-hearted and curses that one day he will turn to stone itself. Saying so, she enters the fire to immolate herself. The curses come true aeons later when Sita gets kidnapped by Ravana, consequently, she is to give the test of purity by fire. Regardless, she is sent into exile once again, where she raises twins, Luv and Kusha. After entrusting their care to Rama, Sita beckons her mother, Bh≈´mi to grant her solace and release from a life of unhappiness, as testament to her purity, chastity and innocence, leaving Rama heartbroken. Death Jalandhara, hearing of his wife's deception and death, was mad with rage and left Mount Kailash, and returned to the battlefield. The illusion by this time had ended and Shiva's army realized the truth. No illusion can be cast on Shiva. Shiva engaged Sumbha and Nisumbha in battle but they fled. They were later killed by Parvati. Jalandhara then engaged Shiva in battle, who killed him by thrusting his Trishula into his chest and cutting his head off with a chakra (discus) created from his toe. Upon his death his soul merged with Shiva just like Vrinda's soul had merged with Lord Vishnu.

Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and other tubers, and Amaranthaceaes (quinoa, ka√±iwa and kiwicha) and legumes (beans and lupins). Staples brought by the Spanish include rice, wheat and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods‚Äîsuch as quinoa, kiwicha, chili peppers, and several roots and tubers‚Äîhave increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef Gaston Acurio has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients. The most important ingredient in all Peruvian cuisine is the potato, as Peru has the widest variety of potatoes in the world. The US food critic Eric Asimov has described it as one of the world's most important cuisines and as an exemplar of fusion cuisine, due to its long multicultural history. Crops Peru is considered an important center for the genetic diversity of the world's crops: *Potatoes, many varieties of potato are native to the Andes mountains.The Peruvian Potato Park at FarmersRights.org Over 99% of all cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a single subspecies, namely Solanum tuberosum. This subspecies has developed into thousands of varieties that vary by size, shape, color, and other sensory characteristics.

Only two varieties of sweet potato are commonly available for sale in the markets, but there are more varieties around the country. One has dry orange flesh and light tan skin and tastes sweet. The other has purple skin, is white and brown inside, and is only moderately sweet. Occasionally another variety, characterized by small tubers and dark skin, is available. Peru has around more than 5000 varieties of potatoes, the biggest in the world. The two most common potatoes are a white-flesh type and a more expensive yellow-flesh type. Among the fruits native to the Andes region in general (Peru, Bolivia) are lucuma, camu camu, prickly pear, cape gooseberry, cocona, pacay (technically a legume but used as a fruit), guanabana, dragon fruit, pepino, papaya, ciruela, mammee apple, banana passionfruit, cherimoya, granadilla, moriche palm fruit, and tamarillo. Yacon, although an underground tuber, is also used as a fruit. Usually, none of the other native fruits are commercially available. From Peru, the Spanish brought back to Europe several foods that would become staples for many peoples around the world. * Potatoes: Potatoes were introduced to Europe from Latin America. They were considered livestock feed in Europe until French chemist Antoine- Augustin Parmentier began serving dishes made from the tubers at his lavish banquets. His guests were immediately convinced that potatoes were fit for human consumption. The varieties used in Europe and most of the world, however, derive from a subspecies indigenous to Peruvian andes, namely Solanum tuberosum. * Beans: Several varieties of the common bean are native to Latin America including the lima bean. The varieties of chili peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and maize that the Spanish brought back to Europe, however, were native to Peru: * Peppers: Chili peppers are native to America. The varieties most commonly used around the world, however, derive from Mexico and Central America. Sweet Peppers are native to Mexico and Central America. Peruvian Aj√≠ peppers are virtually unknown outside of the Andean region of South America. * Maize: Maize (\\"Indian\\" corn), is native to Mesoamerica and Peru; the varieties used in Europe and most of the world are from Central America. The corn grown in Peru is sweet and has large kernels. However, it is not widely consumed outside of Peru. * Tomatoes: The tomato is native to Peru. This is proven by the great number of varieties available in that region. In contrast, Mesoamerica only has two varieties that are currently available commercially, namely the Common Globe and Plum Tomato. Many foods from Spain are now considered Peruvian staples, including wheat, barley, oats, rice, lentils, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), broad beans, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, artichokes, onions, cucumbers, carrots, celery, lettuce, eggplant, wine, vinegar, olives, beef, pork, chicken, numerous spices (including coriander, cumin, parsley, cilantro (green coriander), laurel, mint, thyme, marjoram, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise (fennel), black pepper and oregano), bananas, quince, apples, oranges, limes, apricots, peaches, plums, cherries, melons, figs, pomegranates, honey, white sugar, almonds, walnuts, cheese, hen eggs, cow's milk, etc. Many food plants popular in Europe, however, were imported to Peru. Cultivation of ancient plants Peruvian corn During the colonial period, and continuing up until the time of the Second World War, Peruvian cuisine focused on Spanish models and virtually ignored anything that could be regarded as native or Peruvian. Traditional food plants, which the indigenous people continued to eat, were regarded as \\"peasant food\\" to be avoided. These colonial attitudes took a long time to fade. Since the 1970s, there has been an effort to bring these native food plants out of obscurity. Some plants cultivated by ancient societies of Peru have been rediscovered by modern Peruvians, and are carefully studied by scientists. Due to the characteristics of its land and climate and the nutritional quality of its products, some Peruvian plants may play a vital role in future nutrition. Examples include quinoa (an excellent source of essential amino acids) and ka√±iwa, which look and cook like cereals but are pseudocereals. Nutritionists are also studying root vegetables, such as maca, and cereals like kiwicha. For many of Peru's inhabitants, these food stocks allow for adequate nutrition, even though living standards are poor. Abandoning many of these staples during the Spanish domination and republican eras lowered nutritional levels. Since 1985, NASA has used some of these foods‚Äîquinoa, kiwicha and maca‚Äîfor astronaut meals. Peruvian cuisine is often made spicy with aj√≠ pepper, a basic ingredient. Peruvian chili peppers are not spicy but serve to give taste and color to dishes. Rice often accompanies dishes in Peruvian cuisine, and the regional sources of foods and traditions give rise to countless varieties of preparation and dishes. Regional differences Peru is a country that holds not just a variety of ethnic mixes since times ranging from the Inca Empire, the Viceroyalty and the Republic, but also a climatic variety of 28 individual climates. The mixing of cultures and the variety of climates differ from city to city so geography, climate, culture and ethnic mix determine the variety of local cuisine. = Coastal areas = The Pacific Ocean is the principal source of aquatic resources for Peru. Peru is one of the world's top two producers and exporters of unusually high-protein fishmeal for use in livestock/aquaculture feed. Its richness in fish and other aquatic life is enormous, and many oceanic plant and animal species can only be found in Peru. As important as the Pacific is to Peru's biodiversity, freshwater biomes such as the Amazon River and Lake Titicaca also play a large role in the ecological make-up of the country. Every coastal region, being distinct in flora and fauna populations, adapts its cuisine in accordance to the resources available in its waters. Peruvian ceviche platter Ceviche, a South American dish of marinated raw fish or seafood typically garnished with herbs and served as an appetizer, with many variations (pure, combination, or mixed with fish and shellfish), provides a good example of regional adaptation. Ceviche is found in almost all Peruvian restaurants on the coast, typically served with camote (sweet potato). Often spelled \\"cebiche\\" in Peru, it is the flagship dish of coastal cuisine, and one of the most popular dishes among Peruvians. It consists of Andean chili peppers, onions and acidic aromatic lime, a variety brought by the Spaniards. A spicy dish, it consists generally of bite-size pieces of white fish (such as corvina or white sea bass), marinated raw in lime juice mixed with chilis. Ceviche is served with raw onions, boiled sweet potatoes (camote), toasted corn (cancha). Many Peruvians believe that ceviche is an aphrodisiac and hangover cure, the latter possibly due to the fact that it is traditionally consumed with beer. Unlike ceviche from Mexico and Ecuador, in Peru it does not have tomatoes. Also popular is Leche de tigre (tiger's milk), which is the Peruvian colloquial name for the juice produced from the ingredients of ceviche. It has a light spicy flavor. Chupe de camarones (shrimp cioppino) is one of the most popular dishes of Peruvian coastal cuisine. It is made from a thick freshwater shrimp (crayfish) stock soup, potatoes, milk and chili pepper. It is regularly found in Peruvian restaurants specializing in Arequipan cuisine. A center of immigration and centers of the Spanish Viceroyalty, Lima and Trujillo have incorporated unique dishes brought from the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors and the subsequent waves of immigrants. Besides international immigration‚Äîa large portion of which happened in Lima‚Äîthere has been, since the second half of the 20th century, a strong internal flow from rural areas to cities, in particular to Lima. This has strongly influenced Lima's cuisine with the incorporation of the immigrants' ingredients and techniques. Creole cuisine is the most widespread in this cosmopolitan city. Lima hosts a wide variety of international cuisines, with Italian and Chinese (known locally as chifa, a Chinese-Peruvian fusion) being the most popular. Japanese food, especially sushi, is also very popular, and many chain restaurants from the United States have a significant presence as well. Offerings of Arabic, Thai, Mexican, French, English, Argentine, Brazilian, and Indian cuisine can also be found in multiple locations throughout the city of Lima. The city's bakeries are quite popular with Peruvians. One may find Peruvians standing in line in almost every bakery waiting for freshly baked white bread from 6 to 9 am and from 4 to 6 pm. The majority of Peruvians tend to eat bread for breakfast along with coffee or tea. Almost all bread in Peru, with the exception of baguettes, is fortified with added fats, such as lard. Whole wheat bread is extremely hard to find in the major cities, but more common (and often cheaper) in rural towns. Many bakeries sell white bread sprinkled with bran for health conscious customers as whole wheat flour is extremely hard to find. However, even this bread is often heavily fortified with lard, shortening or butter. Authentic whole wheat bread is imported from Europe and sold at upscale grocery stores. A few coastal cities bakeries produce \\"bollos,\\" which are loaves of bread baked in stone and wood-ovens from the Andes. Anticuchos are brochettes made from beef heart marinated in a various Peruvian spices and grilled, often with a side of boiled potato or corn. They are commonly sold by street vendors, but one may find them in creole food restaurants. Also frequently sold by street vendors are tamales: boiled corn with meat or cheese and wrapped in a banana leaf. They are similar to humitas, which consist of corn mixed with spices, sugar, onions, filled with pork and olives and finally wrapped in the leaves of corn husks. Tamales are a common breakfast food, often served with lime and \\"Salsa Criolla\\" which is a mixture of thinnly sliced raw red onion, aj√≠ peppers, cilantro and lime juice. Papa a la huancaina (Huancayo-style potatoes) Another favorite food found in many restaurants is Papa a la huancaina (Huancayo-style potatoes), a dish consisting of sliced boiled potatoes, served on a bed of lettuce with a slightly spicy cheese sauce with olives. The dish is cheap to make and uses ingredients that are readily available in Peru, yet it has complex flavours and textures so is very popular with chefs in restaurants in Peru. This combination of being cheap to make, yet favored by chefs, has helped Papa a la Huancaina become popular across all classes of Peruvian society., Papa Huancaina section, retrieved 15 June 2013. The name of the dish it is from Huancayo. Tacu-tacu: Mixture of beans, rice and a fried egg, on top of breaded or pan-fried steak and an Salsa Criolla. Papa rellena (stuffed potato): mashed potatoes stuffed with ground (minced) meat, eggs, olives and various spices and then deep fried. Arroz tapado (covered rice): uses the same stuffing of papa rellena, but rather than used as a stuffing, it is accompanied by rice. Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian-flavored rotisserie or roaster chicken): is one of the most consumed foods in Peru. It is roasted chicken marinated in a marinade that includes various Peruvian ingredients, baked in hot ashes or on a spit- roast. The origins of the recipe for this dish date back to Lima, the capital of Peru, during the 1950s. Two Swiss citizens who were Peruvian residents, Roger Shuler and Franz Ulrich, invented and registered the patent (1950) for the machine to cook the chicken on the grill, a mechanical system of planetary rotation in that the chickens rotating on its axis and over a central axis, simultaneously. The dish comes with French fried potatoes, salad and various creams (Peruvian mayonnaise, ketchup, olive sauce, chimichurri and aji (chili) sauces of all kinds). There are many famous brands of \\"Pollo a la Brasa\\" restaurants in Peru and particularly in Lima, the most famous and popular being Hikari, Norky's, Roky's, Pardo's, and La Le√±a. Sancochado is a hearty beef and vegetable broth that includes yuca (cassava) and potatoes. A local staple is Lomo Saltado, also known as saltadito. Sliced beef (tenderloin or in Spanish \\"lomo\\") is stir-fried with, garlic, cumin powder, tomato and Spanish onion and fried-mixed with already fried French cut potatoes, coriander and parsley and accompanied with white rice. Salt and black pepper is also added to taste. Lima has an abundance of Peruvian-style Chinese restaurants or \\"chifas\\" as they are known locally; indeed, arroz chaufa or Chinese style rice is one of the frequently sampled dishes that has found its way into Peruvian cuisine. Arroz con pollo, or rice with chicken, is enjoyed for its rich- flavored rice combined with chicken. Chupe de pescado or fish cioppino is popular in Lima and along the coast. Street food stand in the center of Lima. Lima butter bean salad is a salad made with Lima butter beans (called pallares in Per√∫), cooked whole, cooled, and mixed with a mixture of onion, tomato, and green aj√≠, marinated in lime juice, oil, salt, and vinegar. Lima butter beans (pallares) have been part of the Peruvian cuisine for at least 6,000 years. Butifarras, also known as Jamon del Pais, is a sandwich with \\"Peruvian ham\\", sliced onions, sliced chili peppers, lime, salt, pepper, oil, in a white bread roll. Causa, in its basic form, is a mashed yellow potato dumpling mixed with key lime, onion, chili and oil. Varieties can have avocado, chicken, tuna or even shellfish added to the mixture. Also, causa is popular in Lima, where it is distinguished by the name Causa Lime√±a. Causa is usually served cold with hard boiled eggs and olives. Carapulcra is an appetizing stewed dish of pork and chicken, dried potatoes, red chilis, peanuts and cumin. The version from the Afro-Peruvian Ica region uses fresh potatoes. Empanadas (meat turnovers) were introduced by the Spanish during the colonial period, and later modified, possibly due to lack of Spanish ingredients (olive oil, codfish, smoked paprika, etc.). In Peru, they are filled either with chicken, beef, or cheese. Olives, and sometimes hard boiled eggs and raisins gives them a unique taste. Aj√≠ de gallina (chili chicken or Peruvian creamed chicken) consists of thin strips of chicken served with a creamy yellow and spicy sauce, made with aj√≠ amarillo (Peruvian yellow chilis), cheese, milk, bread. Occasionally walnuts are added on special occasions or at upscale restaurants due to its prohibitive cost in Peru. Traditionally the meat is from non-laying hens, but today almost exclusively made from more tender chickens. Escabeche criollo (pickled fish): \\"Escabeche\\" when the word is used alone normally refers to fish escabeche. Other varieties can use duck or chicken. The escabeche dishes rely in the cooking on the heavy use of vinegar and onions together with other spices and chili. Cau cau is a meal consisting of mondongo or tripe stew and accompanied by rice. There are a number of versions of Cau-Cau, as it is a style of cooking a choice protein. Two noteworthy styles are the creole style simply called Tripe Cau-Cau, and the Italian-Peruvian style. Creole style is made with strips of previously cooked tripe, seasoned with a mixture of sauteed onions, garlic, yellow aji, a pinch of turmeric, salt and pepper and cubes of boiled potatoes. The mixture is cooked together to blend the flavors and acquire consistency. It is then sprinkled with mint. Some add vinegar for added flavor before serving. The other common version is the Italian-Peruvian style. It consists of strips of precooked tripe sauteed with red onions, peeled tomatoes, tomato paste and dried mushrooms, usually Porcini. After the flavors combine, it is seasoned with parsley and mixed with fried potato just prior to serving. Some chefs add a few tablespoons of wine or pisco following the sauteeing. Chicharrones is salted pork deep-fried in its own fat. There are at least two kinds of chicharrones: pork skins, a country style ribs that are first boiled, then rendered in their own fat until they brown into chicharrones. Other types of chicharrones including deep fried squid, and other seafoods. They can be served at any time of day, including breakfast. One of the most popular dishes on the coast is called Lomo Saltado. It is a steak dish which is fried in a wok along with peppers, tomato, garlic, onions, coriander and soy sauce. It is accompanied by french fries and rice. This dish dates back to the 19th century and is a clear exponent of Chinese-Cantonese influence on local cuisine. It is a relatively recent dish because cow meat used to be very expensive. It was not until beef was mass-produced that it became widely available and used in local cuisine. The cuisine of the northern coast offers a difference in style from the central and southern varieties. This is not only due to the coastal native Indian influence (less Andean), the Spanish influence, and the African; but also to the warmer coastal seas, hotter climate and immense geographical latitude variety. The widely different climates between Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca and San Martin contributes to the variety of dishes in these areas. Northern style dishes: Seco de Cabrito (goat stew, often substituted by lamb, chicken, or beef) is made in a pot after marinating in chicha de jora (corn beer) and spices including cilantro and garlic. This dish is most popular in the northern coast especially in Cajamarca and Lambayeque. Seco de Chavelo (typically from Catacaos - Piura) is a type of seco that is made of cecina stewed and dried meat that has been clotted and dried along with bananas, yuca, aji panca (Capsicum chinense) and Clarito (from Chicha de Jora the Piurano style). Cebiche de Conchas Negras (ceviche with black shells) is a dish of Piura and Tumbes is also popular along the southern coast of Ecuador due to Peruvian influence. In this version of ceviche, the seafood used in the dish should be black clams accompanied by toasted corn. =Andes = Alpaca with aguaymanto sauce In the valleys and plains of the Andes, the diet is still a traditional one based on corn (ma√≠z), potatoes, and an assortment of tubers. Meat comes from indigenous animals like alpacas and guinea pigs, but also from imported livestock like sheep, cattle and swine. As with many rural cultures, most of the more elaborate dishes were reserved for festivities, while daily meals were simple affairs. Nowadays, festive dishes are consumed every day by urban dwellers, while rural diets tend to be light on meat and heavy on lahua gruel. The pachamanca is a distinctive Peruvian dish. Cooked all over the Andean region of Peru, it is made from a variety of meats (including pork and beef), herbs and a variety of vegetables that are slowly cooked underground on a bed of heated stones. Because of its tedious preparation it is normally only made for celebrations or festivals in the Andes, though recent years have seen the appearance of many \\"campestre\\" restaurants in rural areas outside Lima, such as in Cieneguilla.Places for Pachamanca in Lima Surroundings Andean cooking's main freshwater fish is the trout, raised in fisheries in the region. Cuy chactado: A dish more popular in the highlands is this meal of fried guinea pig. Often the indigenous women of the Peruvian Andes will raise the guinea pigs in their huts. Besides the use of guinea pigs as separate meals, they are often cooked in a Pachamanca with other meats and vegetables. Olluquito con charqui is another traditional Andean dish. Olluco is a yellowish tuber (Ullucus tuberosus) domesticated by pre-Inca populations, and is visually similar to colorful small Andean potatoes, but with a distinct crunchy texture when cooked. Charqui is the technique employed in the Andean highlands to cure meat by salting, then dehydration (the word \\"jerky\\" in English is derived from this Andean (Quechuan) word). The dish is a stew of finely diced ollucos with charqui pieces (traditionally alpaca, or less frequently llama meat, though today it is also very commonly made from sheep), served with white rice. Rocoto relleno: Arequipa dish made from stuffed rocoto chilis. Rocotos are one of the very hot (spicy) chilis of Peru. In this dish they are stuffed with spiced beef or pork, onions, olives, and egg white, then cooked in the oven with potatoes covered with cheese and milk. Tocosh or Togosh is a traditional Quechua food prepared from fermented potato pulp. Puka Pikanti: Ayacucho dish made from white potatoes, beets, yellow chili pepper, mint, and peanuts. In Peruvian restaurants, steak is commonly served with rice rather than fries. =Amazon = Naturally, Amazonian cuisine is made using the products local to the Amazon rainforest. Although many animal species are hunted for food in the biologically diverse jungle, standouts are the paiche (one of the world's largest freshwater fish), prepared in variety of dishes; many other types of fish like gamitana, sabalo (Salminus hilarii, see Salminus), tucunare, boquichico, palometa, bagre, and many others including the piranha, that are prepared in variety of dishes such as \\"timbuche\\" (soup) or \\"patarashca\\" (grilled in vegetables); many types of turtles like the motelo (land turtle), and the charapa and taricaya (river turtles). Hunting turtles is prohibited in Peru, therefore turtle-based dishes are scarce and expensive and not sold √† la carte in restaurants. Other animals include the majas, the sajino, the agouti and jungle mammals, which are called collectively \\"carne de monte\\". The Black Caiman is also considered a delicacy; but its hunt is forbidden under Peruvian law. Among the fruits of Peru's jungle is the camu camu, which contains 40 times more vitamin C than the kiwifruit. Non-native fruits such as mango and pineapple and star apple are also in abundance, as well as other jungle fruits like, mammee apple, cherimoya, guanabana, taperiva, copoazu, dry fruits like the aguaje and the hungurahui. Juane is rice seasoned with turmeric, and chicken wrapped with bijao leaves. Chapo is a beverage made with sweet plantain. Other regional dishes Ocopa Chalona or Charqui is a cured dried meat originally obtained from alpaca. It is also eaten in Bolivia, and was eaten by the Indians in the coast and highlands of Peru before the arrival of the Spanish. Today lamb is often substituted for alpaca meat. It is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes of the Puno region, Cusco, and Arequipa. It is prepared using recently cured lamb, in which furrows are made with a knife so the salt can penetrate. Salt penetration is important, because it determines how long the cured meat lasts. The meat is left to dry in the sun and cold nights for almost one month. Chairo: A traditional soup of the Puno and Arequipa regions. It origins have been traced to the Collan Indians who live in the Andes of Bolivia and southern Peru. The soup consists of black chu√±o, aji panca (red chili pepper), sweet potatoes, sheep tripe and chalona. Ocopa: A dish with some similarities to Papas a la Huancaina. It consists of boiled and sliced yellow potatoes covered with a sauce of made of aji (chili pepper), the Peruvian herb Tagetes minuta, (called huacatay; the herb gives it a vivid green color), ground peanuts, and fresh or white cheese, with sides of lettuce, boiled eggs and olives. At expensive restaurants walnuts are often added, but this is seldom done in Peruvian homes due to the prohibitive cost of walnuts in Peru. The name ocopa is also used to refer to the hot sauce by itself. Cop√∫s is one of the best known dishes of Piura. Its ingredients are ripe fried bananas, camotes (sweet potatoes), and seasoned hen, turkey, goat, and mutton. The meat is cooked in a furnace under the ground; this method is different from using a pachamanca since the furnace is covered with blankets and clay. Yuca chupe or cassava soup is one of the variations in which the Peruvians enjoy cassava. Currently, ostrich meat is being raised on farms in Arequipa, although its consumption is not widespread and limited to urban areas. Sangrecita: A dish of cooked chicken blood seasoned with garlic, onion, chilli and herbs and commonly served with potatoes, sweet potatoes or cassava. Crema de tarwi (tarwi soup): Tarwi is a vegetable native to the mountains of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. In addition to its use in soup, tarwi is used in much of Peruvian cuisine, including sancochado. Fresh tarwi can be used in stews, purees, sauces, desserts and in a variation of cebiche. In some areas, locals call it chocho. Its cultivation has recently expanded to all the countries of the Andean region. In Peru, it is principally grown in the areas of Cajamarca, Ancash, the Mantaro Valley, Ayacucho, Cusco, and Puno. Tarwi can also be found in beverages (such as papaya juice with tarwi flour). Tarwi has been shown to have a higher vegetable protein content than soy. In pre-Incan and Incan times, it was an important part of the mostly vegetarian diet of the region. It was consumed with small quantities of meat and dried fish, providing an abundant source of protein for the population. Tarwi seeds have been found in Nazca tombs and in representations of Tiahuanaco ceramics. Chifa Lomo saltado Chifa (from the Mandarin words ÂêÉÈ•≠ \\"chi1 fan4\\", meaning \\"to eat rice\\") is the Peruvian term for Peruvian‚ÄìChinese food (or for a Peruvian-Chinese fusion restaurant). Because many Chinese ingredients are hard to find in Peru, the Chinese modified their cuisine and incorporated many Peruvian elements (mainly Spanish, native and African) into their cuisine. Even today, it is difficult to find authentic Chinese cuisine in Peru. This is mainly due to popularity of the hybridization of Chinese food, which is commonly called \\"Chifa,\\" and a lack of many Chinese ingredients. Sweet dishes and desserts Small alfajores Suspiro a la lime√±a Man√° for Christmas Alfajores: a dessert found in virtually all of Spain's former colonies. It is derived from the versions popular in Spain during the colonial period. The original Spanish recipes, however, have been modified because the original ingredients are expensive in Peru (almonds, honey) or even unobtainable (hazelnuts, lemon rind, coriander seed, etc.). The basic recipe uses a base mix of flour, margarine, and powdered sugar, which is oven-baked. Alfajores consist of two or more layers of this baked pastry, and is usually filled with manjar blanco (a caramel-colored, sweet, creamy filling made with milk and sugar) Turrones (or nougat) is another originally Spanish dessert. The original Spanish recipe, which contained ingredients that were rare or expensive in Peru (such as almonds, rose water, orange blossom water, honey) were modified in a variety of ways. One common variety found in Lima is Turr√≥n de Do√±a Pepa, an anise and honey nougat that is traditionally prepared for the Se√±or de los Milagros (or Lord of Miracles) religious procession, during October. Almost exclusive to the Andes region is the fruit known as l√∫cuma. L√∫cuma juice, ice cream, and corresponding l√∫cuma shakes are very popular throughout Peru. L√∫cuma ice cream can normally only be found in large US cities (typically in Peruvian restaurants). One popular brand of ice cream in Peru is D'Onofrio, which is owned by Nestl√©. Arroz con leche (rice pudding): Another dessert originally from Spain that can be found in various varieties throughout Latin America. Arroz con leche is one of the more common desserts found in homes and restaurants of modern-day Peru. It consists primarily of cooked rice, cinnamon/nutmeg, raisins, and milk. Rice pudding never has lemon rind as is traditional in the Spanish version. Arroz con leche is usually eaten with Peruvian Mazamorra (jelly-like clove-flavored dessert). Helados (ice cream): The most common ice cream flavors found in Peru are lucuma, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Some more exotic flavors such as camu camu, guaran√° and prickly pear can occasionally be found. For other commonly available flavors, however, one needs to purchase imported ice-cream as many of the ingredients are not available in Peru. Peru is one of few countries in the world where the third most popular ice-cream (after vanilla and chocolate) is not strawberry, it is in fact the \\"nutty\\" flavored, orange colored l√∫cuma, which is an exotic fruit grown in quantity only in Peru, and only in recent years being exported in very limited quantities as an exotic flavor (for ice cream and savory sauces) to the US, and available in Europe essentially in food shows. Mazamorra morada: Is a jelly-like clove-flavored dessert. It takes on the color of one of its main ingredients: purple maize. A variety of purple corn (ma√≠z morado) that only grows in Peru adds color to the water it's boiled in, along with cinnamon cloves. When the water cools, chopped fruit, key lime and sugar are added. The mixture is served as a beverage called \\"chicha morada\\". Picarones: a sweet, ring-shaped fritter with a pumpkin base; often served with a molasses syrup. Picarones were created during the colonial period to replace the Spanish dessert Bu√±uelos, as bu√±uelos were too expensive to make (They had an egg custard filling) and some ingredients were unavailable (lemon rinds). Peruvian Picarones are made of squash or pumpkin dough and sweetened with chancaca, raw cane sugar melted into a syrup. Tejas: another modified Spanish dessert. The original Spanish version contained ingredients that were prohibitively expensive in Peru, such as almonds. The Peruvian version of this candy is filled with manjar blanco and coated with a fondant-like shell. Some are also made with a chocolate shell (chocoteja). King Kong: is made of cookies (made from flour, butter, eggs and milk), filled with milk candy, some pineapple sweet and in some cases peanuts, with cookies within its layers. It is sold in one-half and one kilogram sizes. It is known as part of the culture of Lambayeque Region. Suspiro a la Lime√±a: Is another Spanish-influenced dessert that uses dulce de leche, which derives from the Spanish Blancmange. The bottom layer is made of dulce de leche enriched with egg yolks. The top layer consists of meringue made with port wine. This classic criollo dessert is said to have been named by the famous Peruvian poet and author Jos√© G√°lvez whose wife do√±a Amparo Ayarez was famous for her cooking. When asked what inspired the name, he reportedly replied, \\"Because it is soft and sweet, like the sigh of a woman.\\" In this case, it would be a woman from Lima, a Lime√±a. Panet√≥n: is a type of sweet bread with dried fruit. It is usually served for breakfast around Christmas with a cup of hot chocolate. They used to come in big boxes only with huge panet√≥ns inside but now they also sell personal portions. Chocot√≥n is variety of panet√≥n that replaces the fruit with chocolate bits. The bread is very light and sweet. Because Christmas is the hottest time of year, people often replace the hot chocolate with coffee or a drink that's served cold. Flan de leche is also a very popular dish. Beverages Inca Kola Pisco Sour =Soft drinks= The most commonly encountered soft drinks in Peru are: *Chicha morada: a clove- flavored beverage prepared from a base of boiled purple maize and a generous amount of powdered cloves, to which sugar, cinnamon and ice are added as it cools. Occasionally chunks of pineapple are added. The taste is reminiscent of old-fashioned clove-flavored candy. Chicha de jora is a beer made with corn (see below) *Inca Kola: a lemon verbena flavored soda (verbena de limon), which is a cultural icon, served from the most humble to the most exclusive tables nationwide. Yellow in color, it is very sweet (with a candy-like taste). Inca Kola beat out Coca-Cola in Peruvian sales, the only other national beverage apart from Irn-Bru in Scotlandhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/irn-bru-is-bigger-than-coke-in- scotland-ttd9qmdm0t6 to beat Coca-Cola in the world. This is mainly due to nationalism prevalent among Peruvians, and an advertising campaign that capitalized on the fact that Inca Kola is a Peruvian product. In 1997, however, Coca-Cola acquired 49 percent of the Inca Kola company. Although exported to various countries, Inca Kola has not enjoyed major success elsewhere. *Kola Inglesa: a cherry-flavored red soda introduced in 1912 by its English creator, Erin Stone. *Kola Escocesa: a purple soda, traditional in the city of Arequipa. The beverage has been produced since the 1950s using mineral water. Less common are: *Refresco de camu camu: Refrescos are juices of various flavours mixed with water and sugar and often served with the set menu of the day at smaller restaurants. Besides camu camu, there are more common flavours such as orange. Pure juices, such as orange juice or grape juice, are seldom encountered in Peru due to their expense. *T√© de u√±a de gato: a tea made from a plant from the Amazon, cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), which is consumed for its supposed healing or medicinal properties. =Alcoholic drinks= Pisco, a type of brandy, is the national drink of Peru. It originated during the colonial period as a cheaper substitute for the Spanish liquor known as orujo. Nevertheless, orujo is a product made from the spoils of wine production. Pisco uses fresh grapes like wine-making. This distilled beverage made from grapes is produced in various regions of the country. Pisco Sour is a cocktail made from pisco combined with lime juice, egg white and simple syrup. Chilcano is also made with Pisco. Wines come from many different regions of the country, most notably from the Ica Region. Beer, as in many countries, is popular at all levels of society. Local brands include Pilsen Callao and Cristal. Other regional beers are Arequipe√±a, Cusque√±a and Pilsen Trujillo from Arequipa, Cuzco and Trujillo respectively; though Cuzque√±a is popular nationwide and is exported worldwide. A common beer-drinking ritual among many Peruvian men involves a group sharing one glass. The party holding the bottle waits for the prior person to drink from the glass before receiving that glass, filling it and passing the bottle on to the next in line. While this custom is more common among men of lower classes of society, people of higher social status, particularly youth and occasionally women, take part in this custom for fun. Chicha de jora is another well-known drink, based on different varieties of fermented maize and different aromatic herbs, depending on the region of the country. Its consumption is mostly limited to the Andes area. See also * List of Peruvian dishes * Andean cuisine * Tourism in Peru References *Platos Peruanos - A.B.C. S.A. Lima.

Clustered leaves are up to 25 mm long; the single alternate leaves are up to 55 mm long. The flowers grow in groups of one to three in the leaf axils, with pedicels 6‚Äì15 mm long. The calyx, eventually ruptured by the growing berry, is a whitish tube crowned by five or six radial triangular sepals, shorter than the tube, 10‚Äì12 mm long and 3‚Äì4 mm wide, sometimes 2‚Äìlipped, strongly curved. The sepals are whitish on the lower side (facing towards the branch) and deep mauve on the top side. Each flower has five stamens, exserted for 3‚Äì8 mm, with stalks longer than the anthers. The pistil is 8‚Äì11.5 mm long. The anthers are longitudinally dehiscent. = Fruit = The fruit of L. barbarum, the main variety of goji berry, is a bright orange-red, ellipsoid berry in diameter. The fruiting calyx is split deeply once or twice. The number of seeds in each berry varies widely based on cultivar and fruit size, ranging from 10 to 60. The seeds are about 2 mm long, 1 mm wide, yellowish, compressed with a curved embryo. =Reproduction= The plants are self-pollinating, but may be cross pollinated by insects. The species is dispersed into natural areas by birds and other animals that eat its fruit. In the Northern Hemisphere, flowering occurs from June through September and berry maturation from August to October, depending on the latitude, altitude, and climate. Where frost does not occur fruiting is continuous and plants do not lose their leaves. Occurrence and cultivation =China= Lycium barbarum has been cultivated in China, along the fertile aggradational floodplains of the Yellow River, for more than 600 years. It is still extensively cultivated in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of north- central China, centered in Zhongning County, totaling 200,000 acres as of 2005, Xinhua News Agency, Opening ceremonies of Ningxia wolfberry festival, August 3, 2005.

Prohibited Import of Goji Plants . April 30, 2008 =United States= Lycium barbarum has become a high demand plant in the United States. Nearly all major nursery catalogs now carry plants and there are many suppliers found on various web sites. There are a number of varieties available, ranging from leaf producing plants to fruit producing varieties. Most listed plants are hardy zones 5-9. One variety, Phoenix Tears is hardy zones 3-10. This variety produces fruit year round in warmer climates. Berries and leaves produced in the United States are probably more pesticide free than those produced in China. At present only the US state of Pennsylvania requires inspection of imported L. barbarum plants. There have been cases of goji mite outbreaks in Pennsylvania and California. The mites have been found on wild plants in Utah and do have the potential to infect other family Solanaceae plants, but there is no documentation of such infections occurring in the United States.Pennsylvania Dept. of Agriculture =Australia= Lycium barbarum introduced to Australia became naturalised in south-eastern coastal and sub-coastal regions, and is regarded as an environmental weed in the provinces of Victoria and Tasmania.

Plot synopsis Dr. John Carter is back in the States to wrap up his affairs. He purchases half a dozen pizzas for the ER staff, as well as some refreshments. He also treats a patient who has injured her wrist. Ray is dealing with whether he wants to go into his residency as a doctor. Dr. Archie Morris and Dr. Ray Barnett leave for another party. This party is held on several floors in the back of an apartment building on the balconies at each level. Morris promptly becomes intoxicated, and begins vomiting. Barnett goes to help him. Suddenly the porches collapse, one on top of each other. Carter then leaves with Dr. Kovaƒç for his \\"surprise\\" farewell party, where most of the attending doctors and his friends are waiting for him. County General then stops accepting trauma patients after further problems with the sewer pipes in the hospital leaves them with only one operating room, coupled with the fact that the majority of the ER staff is at Carter's party. 6 people are killed in the porch collapse, and some are not hurt too badly. Five more are critically injured in the accident. Barnett surprises his friends with his handling of the situation. The paramedics on the scene tell Barnett that they are going to take the critically injured to St. Rafe's Hospital because County is closed. County is the only Chicago hospital that has Level I Trauma Status in the show, making it the first choice for such situations. Barnett uses the radio to call County and demands that Abby reopen the ER, otherwise the five critical patients would probably not make it to the hospital. Dr. Lockhart initially refuses, as there are no attending physicians and only one OR, but when one of the critical patients dies, she relents. Unable to reach Dr. Kovaƒç by pager, they send a student over to fetch him. The party immediately evaporates, as everyone runs back to the ER to help the victims of the porch collapse. A surprised Carter returns from the restroom to empty tables, except for an orderly he doesn't know. They spend some time watching a slideshow of his time at County. The presentation features past ER doctors, including Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney), Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), and Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle). Eventually Dr. Susan Lewis brings Carter back to the ER. Life comes full circle for Carter when he treats one last patient before leaving County General. He is surprised to learn that he delivered the young girl with the broken wrist 11 years ago in Season 1. Before he leaves he stops by to see Ray, Neela and Abby and shares the letter he wrote to himself as an intern under Dr. Greene, that had sat in his locker until this point. As Carter is leaving the hospital for the last time, Dr. Greene and Dr. Benton (his primary mentors) and Nurse Carol Hathaway are heard in voice-overs. Outside, he finds a fatigued and partially sober Morris crouching outside. Carter repeats the advice that was given to Dr. Greene by Dr. Morgenstern to the new chief resident: \\"You set the tone.\\" However, Morris, still suffering from the hangover, barely registers the advice and Carter, with a chuckle, goes to catch his train. And Carter leaves the ER and Chicago to be with his wife, Kem.

Vera Bugatti, \\"The Storytellers\\", 35th international street painting competition in Geldern A street painter working in New York City Painter Manuel Bastante, Pantomime Pablo Zibes, Festival Mantova, ItalyStreet painting, also known as screeving, pavement art, street art, and sidewalk art, is the performance art of rendering artistic designs on pavement such as streets, sidewalks, and town squares with impermanent and semi-permanent materials such as chalk. Origin The origins of modern street painting can be traced to Britain. Pavement artists were found all over the United Kingdom and by 1890 it was estimated that more than 500 artists were making a full-time living from pavement art in London alone. The British term for a pavement artist is a \\"screever\\". The term is derived from the writing style, often Copperplate, that typically accompanied the works of pavement artists since the 1700s. The term screever is most commonly cited as Shakespearean slang dating from around 1500. The works of screevers often were accompanied by poems and proverbs, lessons on morality, and political commentary on the day‚Äôs events. They were described as \\"producing a topical, pictorial newspaper of current event.\\" They appealed to both the working people, who (on the whole) could not read or write, but understood the visual images; and to the educated members of the middle-classes who appreciated the moral lessons and comments. It was important for a screever to catch the eye of the ‚Äòwell to do‚Äô and in turn attract the pennies donated for their efforts. Street painters, (also called chalk artists) a name these performance artists are most commonly called in the United States are called I Madonnari in Italy (singular form: madonnaro or madonnara) because they recreated images of the Madonna. In Germany, the word is Stra√üenmaler (streets: \\"Stra√üen\\", painter: \\"Maler\\"). The Italian Madonnari have been traced to the sixteenth century. They were itinerant artists, many of whom had been brought into the cities to work on the huge cathedrals. When the work was completed, they needed to find another way to make a living, and thus often would recreate the paintings from the church onto the pavement. Aware of festivals and holy days held in each province and town, they traveled to join in the festivities to make a living from observers who would throw coins if they approved of the artist's work. For centuries, many Madonnari were folk artists, reproducing simple images with crude materials such as tiles, coal, and chalk. Others, such as El Greco, would go on to become household names. In 1973, street painting was being promoted in Italy by the formation of a two-day festival in Grazie di Curtatone in the Province of Mantua. In the 1980s, Kurt Wenner practiced '3-D pavement art', or one-point perspective art, otherwise known as anamorphic art, a 500-year-old technique, which appears in proper perspective only when viewed from a specific angle. Festivals The first recorded street-painting competition and 'festival' was held in London in 1906. In 1972 the first 'Italian' International Street Painting Competition was held in Grazie di Curtatone, Italy. It is part of festival celebrating the Assumption with the streets of the city being turned over to the festival. In 1987, Wenner and Manfred Stader introduced street painting to Old Mission Santa Barbara, California. One of the largest events in the United States is the Lake Worth Street Painting Festival, held in Lake Worth Florida. Started in 1994, it attracts 100,000 visitors over the weekend to see 250 works of art by over 400 artists.Lake Worth Street Painting Festival website In 1993, Rosy Loyola created Festival Bella Via in Monterrey, Mexico, which has launched several Mexican artists into the international street painting field. Within the years it has become the most important street painting festival in Latin America. Started in 2002, The Denver Chalk Art Festival on Larimer Square, located in Downtown Denver, is a free two-day street-painting festival. More than 200 artists spend hours during the weekend turning the streets of Larimer Square, into a museum of chalk art. The Festival is produced by the Larimer Arts Association, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting arts awareness and education in Denver. In 2008 Mark Wagner and 6,000 people (over 4,000 elementary school kids from Alameda, CA) set a Guinness World Record for the World's largest Pavement Art covering over 90,000 sq. ft.

In July 2011, the 3-Way-Split Project produced the First Annual in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, United Kingdom. The city of Lake Worth Florida is cited as the source of inspiration, by the project director. Nine street artists from the United States came to Southend-on-Sea to support the launch of this new annual event. In 2012 the festival will be held on the second Saturday in September.http://www.streetpainting-southend.org International Street Painting & Festival of the Arts In August 2012 the Second International StreetArt was staged in Wilhelmshaven in Germany. 37 artists from all over the world traveled to Wilhelmshaven in Germany.

The tax base of such a tax is the money spent on consumption. Consumption taxes are usually indirect, such as a sales tax or a value-added tax. However, a consumption tax can also be structured as a form of direct, personal taxation, such as the Hall‚ÄìRabushka flat tax. Types =Value- added tax= A value-added tax applies to the market value added to a product or material at each stage of its manufacture or distribution. For example, if a retailer buys a shirt for twenty dollars and sells it for thirty dollars, this tax would apply to the ten dollar difference between the two amounts. A simple value-added tax would be proportional to consumption but would also tend to be regressive on income at higher income levels, as consumption tends to fall as a percentage of income as income rises. Savings and investment are tax-deferred until they become consumption. A value-added tax may exclude certain goods to make it less regressive against income. It is imposed in European Union countries. Value added tax is a consumption based tax and is levied each and every time the value of a good gets increased in the process of manufacturing to the point of sale. In Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore, it is instead called a \\"Goods and Services Tax.\\" In Canada it is also called Harmonized Sales Tax when it is combined with a provincial sales tax. =Sales tax= Sales tax is a part of government revenue and is normally a consumption tax applicable to sales of goods & services. It is accepted by the government to collect the sales tax by the retailer and further deposit it to the government. A sales tax typically applies to the sale of goods, and sometimes also to the sales of services. The tax is applied at the point of sale. Laws may allow sellers to itemize the tax separately from the price of the goods or services, or they may require it to be included in the price. The tax amount is usually ad valorem, that is, it is calculated by applying a percentage rate to the taxable price of a sale. When a tax on goods or services is paid to a governing body directly by a consumer, it is usually called a use tax. Often laws provide for the exemption of certain goods or services from sales and use taxes. =Excise tax= An excise tax is a sales tax that applies to a specific class of goods, typically alcohol, tobacco, gasoline (petrol), or tourism. The tax rate varies according to the type of good and quantity purchased and is typically unaffected by the person who purchases it. Sin taxes, are a type of excise tax imposed on items which are considered harmful to society, in an effort to decrease their consumption by increasing their prices. =Expenditure tax= A direct, personal consumption tax may take the form of an expenditure tax, that is, an income tax that deducts savings and investments, such as the Hall‚ÄìRabushka flat tax.The Flat Tax , By Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, Hoover Institution A direct consumption tax may be called an expenditure tax, a cash-flow tax, or a consumed-income tax and can be flat or progressive. Expenditure taxes have been briefly implemented in the past in India and Sri Lanka. This form of tax applies to the difference between the income of an individual and the increase/decrease in his savings. Like the other consumption taxes, simple personal consumption taxes tend to be regressive with respect to income. However, because this tax applies on an individual basis, it can be made as progressive as a progressive personal income tax. Just as income tax rates increase with personal income, consumption tax rates increase with personal consumption. Economists from Milton Friedman to Edward Gramlich and Robert H. Frank have supported a progressive consumption tax. History Consumption taxes, specifically excise taxes, have featured in several notable historic events. In the United States, the stamp tax, the tax on tea, and whiskey taxes produced revolts, the first two against the British government and the latter against the new federal government. In India, an excise tax on salt led to Mohandas Gandhi's famous Salt March, a major event in the Indian Independence Movement. =United States= In the early United States, taxes were levied principally on consumption. Alexander Hamilton, one of the two chief authors of the anonymous The Federalist Papers, favored consumption taxes in part because they are harder to raise to confiscatory levels than income taxes. In The Federalist Papers (No. 21), Hamilton wrote: Although personal and corporate income taxes provide the bulk of revenue to the federal government, consumption taxes continue to be a primary source of income for state and local governments. One of the first detailed proposals of a personal consumption tax was developed in 1974 by William Andrews.Andrews, William D. \\"A Consumption-Type or Cash Flow Personal Income Tax\\", 87 Harv. L.

If, in the absence of taxes, one dollar of savings is put aside for retirement at nine percent compound interest, savings will grow to $7.91 after twenty-four years. Alternatively, by assuming a thirty-three percent tax rate, the same dollar is reduced to about sixty-seven cents after taxes when earned. The effective interest rate, thereafter, is reduced to six percent, since the rest of the yield is paid in taxes. After twenty-four years, the balance increases only to $2.73. The cumulative taxes in the latter case are $1.02. The other $4.16 is not lost by the economy in any sense, as the $4.16 is what the government would make in interest, if it had invested its tax revenue in the same investment. If the initial invested amount is not taxed when earned, but the earnings are taxed thereafter, the cumulative taxes paid are the same, but are spread more evenly across the period. These results are primarily sensitive to the rate of return; for example, with a three percent return most of the tax receipts come from the tax on the initial dollar. To the extent that taxing something results in less of it (whether income or consumption), taxing consumption instead of income should encourage both work and capital formation, which will increase economic growth, while discouraging consumption. Secondly, the tax base will be larger because all consumption will be taxed. Some critics argue that consumption taxes can shift the tax burden to the less well-off. The ratio of tax obligation to income tends to shrink as income increases because high-earners tend to consume proportionally less of their income. Gilbert E. Metcalf. \\"The National Sales Tax: Who Bears the Burden?\\" An individual unable to save will pay taxes on all his income, but an individual who saves or invests a portion of his income will be taxed only on the remaining income. Practical considerations Many proposed consumption taxes share some features with income tax systems. Under these proposals, taxpayers would be given exemptions and/or a standard deduction in order to ensure that the poor do not pay any tax. In a pure consumption tax, these other deductions would not be permitted. A withholding system may also be put into place in order to estimate the total tax liability. It would be difficult for many taxpayers to pay no tax all year, only to be faced with a large tax bill at the end of the year. A consumption tax could also eliminate the concept of basis when computing the value of investments. All income that is put in investments (such as property, stocks, savings accounts) would be tax-free. As the asset grows in value, it would not be taxed. Only when the proceeds from the investment are spent is any tax imposed. This is in contrast with an income tax system where if land is bought and sold it with a profit, the gain is taxable. A consumption tax taxes only consumption, so if an investment is sold to buy another investment, no tax is imposed. Andrews notes the inherent problem with housing. Renters necessarily \\"consume\\" housing, so they will be taxed on the expenditure of rent. However, homeowners also consume housing in the same way, but as they pay down a mortgage, the payments are classified as savings, not consumption (because equity is being built in an asset). The disparity is explained by what is known as the imputed rental value of a home. A homeowner could choose to rent the home to others in exchange for money but instead chooses to live in the home to the exclusion of all possible renters. Therefore, the homeowner is also consuming housing by not permitting renters to pay for and occupy the home. The amount of money that the homeowner could receive in rent is the imputed rental value of the home. A true consumption tax would tax the imputed rental value of the home (which could be determined in the same way that valuation occurs for property tax purposes) and would not tax the increase in the value of the asset (the home). Andrews proposes to ignore this method of taxing imputed rental values because of its complexity. In the United States, home ownership is subsidized by the federal government by permitting limited deductions for mortgage interest expense and capital gains. Therefore, treating renters and homeowners identically under a consumption tax may not be feasible there. This issue would not arise under an expenditure tax, since all withdrawals of funds from a pre-tax investment account are treated as taxable consumption, whether these funds are used to pay rent, buy a house, or pay down mortgage principal. A person may buy a house within a pre-tax account, but would not be allowed to live there. Also, a consumption tax could utilize progressive rates in order to maintain \\"fairness\\". More consumption means more tax liability.  Economic impact  The temporal neutrality of a consumption tax, however, is that consumption itself is taxed, so it is irrelevant what good or service is being consumed in terms of allocation of resources. The only possible effect on neutrality is between consumption and savings. Taxing only consumption should, in theory, cause an increase in savings. Many economists and tax experts favor consumption taxes over income taxes for economic growth. Depending on implementation (such as treatment of depreciation) and circumstances, income taxes either favor or disfavor investment. (On the whole, the American system is thought to disfavor investment.) By not disfavoring investment, a consumption tax would increase the capital stock, productivity, and therefore increase the size of the economy. Consumption also more closely tracks long- run average income. The income of an individual or family can often vary dramatically from year to year. The sale of a home, a one-time job bonus, and various other events can lead to temporary high income that will push a lower or middle income person into a higher tax bracket. On the other hand, a wealthier individual may be temporarily unemployed and earn no income. =William Gale= In the United States context, William Gale, Co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, offers a simplified way to understand a consumption tax: assume that the current U.S. tax system remains the same but remove limitations to contributing to and removing funds from a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Thus, a person would essentially have a bank account where they could place tax-free earnings at any time, but unsaved (or consumed) withdrawals would be subject to taxation.

A. M. ‚Äì others include The Last Supper and The Agony in the Garden. Master I. A. M. of Zwolle (known works 1470‚Äì1490, lifetime estimated as ca. 1440‚Äì1504Master I. A. M. of Zwolle on the Website of the British Museum) was an anonymous Dutch goldsmith and engraver who signed many of his works with his initials I. A. M. or I. A., and added \\"Zwolle\\" to some. His work is characterized by crowded and active scenes of people, graded tones and crisp strokes. Only 26 works by his hand are extant. Identity One theory of Master I. A. M.'s identity points to Johan van den Minnesten (also spelled Mynnesten, b. ca. 1440, d. 1504) as the artist behind the engravings. This obscure artist was a painter in Zwolle, but none of his works have survived, so it is impossible to prove a connection on stylistic grounds. The only link between him and Master I. A. M. is a record that his son, also named Johan, was paid to print several engravings for the city of Zwolle in 1545; these were possibly plates inherited from his father. weaver's shuttle. Another theory posits that Master I.A.M's prints were produced by two collaborating artists, one who designed the prints and another who engraved and printed them. In this theory I. A. M. could stand for \\"Johannes Aurifaber Meester\\" (Master John the Goldsmith), possibly Johannes Ludolphi, a goldsmith who arrived in Zwolle in 1479.A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 137, One variation of this theory supposes that the signature contains the marks of both artists: I. A. M. would be Johann van den Minnesten's signature, while the image of a drill is the hallmark of the goldsmith / engraver. This collaborative theory would explain the vast differences in composition between the still and simple The Madonna Seated, the Christ Child Holding the Cross and the manneristically dynamic The Betrayal of Christ. Work The Madonna Seated, the Christ Child Holding a Cross. Engraving, 21.8 x 17.7 cm (sheet size). Allegory of the Transience of Life,(ca. 1480-90), 33.3 x 22.6 cm, engraving printed on vellum, with hand-colouring. British Museum Master I. A. M. produced original and inventive compositions in a style that has been variously described as \\"lively\\", \\"dramatic\\", \\"turbulent\\" \\"refined\\" and marked by \\"Dutch swagger\\".Shestack, Mayor, McDonald ops. cit His engraving technique was careful and neat but tending to dryness. Later prints show more dramatic use of tonal contrasts, in drapery and other areas. His faces mostly have Dutch peasant features, sometimes bordering on the grotesque. The major influence upon Master I. A. M.'s early work appears to have been Rogier van der Weyden, although he was also influenced by Martin Schongauer. Hieronymous Bosch, a contemporary, also appears to have influenced the grotesque figures in The Betrayal of Christ: Bosch's Christ Carrying the Cross of Vienna is particularly similar. The artist's style appears to have changed dramatically around 1485; the drapery of his figures became more sculptural, separated into broad planes like contemporary wood sculptures, as opposed to his earlier and more fluid style. This has generated speculation among scholars that some of these later prints were either designs for wood relief sculptures, or were based upon reliefs that are now lost. This is partially supported by records that Johan van den Minnesten was commissioned to paint several relief sculptures. His most involved work was a series of passion engravings, of which only The Last Supper, The Agony in the Garden, and The Betrayal of Christ survive. =List of works= Dimensions given are that of the image. The essence of printmaking is the production of multiple images, so most of these works exist in more than one copy and are in the collections of several museums. As with most 15th-century prints, surviving impressions of his works are rare - the three Passion prints survive in 8,8 and 20 impressions only. The works can only be approximately dated, if at all, because so little is known about Master I. A. M.'s life. None of the prints were titled, so they are given generic or descriptive titles that vary slightly between sources. The individual impressions also vary in sheet size. *The Adoration of the Magi 35.3 x 24 cm *The Last Supper 34.7 x 26.8 cm *The Agony in the Garden 39.5 x 29.6 cm *The Betrayal of Christ 34.1 x 26.8 cm *The Large Crucifixion with the Horsemen 35.8 x 24.8 cm *The Lamentation over Christ (Piet√†) 26.3 x 30 cm *Christ Blessing 23.5 x 14.3 cm *The Virgin and Child with Cherries at the Window 22.5 x 16.2 cm (irregular) *The Madonna Seated, the Christ Child Holding the Cross 22.5 x 18 cm *The Virgin Standing on a Demon 22.3 x 14.4 cm *The Virgin and Child, Turning over the Leaves of a Book 23.8 x 19.5 cm *Saint Anne, the Virgin and Child on a Throne 26.6 x 19.2 cm *Saint Augustine with the Heart, Pierced by an Arrow 26.6 x 21 cm *Saint Bernard Kneeling before the Virgin 32.6 x 26.1 cm *Saint Christopher on Horseback 28.6 x 20.6 cm *Saint George 20.5 x 13.8 cm *Mass of Saint Gregory 10.2 x 6.4 cm (This particular engraving is a copy after Master W with the Key) *Mass of Saint Gregory 15.2 x 12.4 cm *Mass of Saint Gregory 32.3 x 22.4 cm *Allegory of the Transience of Life 33.3 x 22.6 cm *Battle of Two Men with the Centaur 15.7 x 22.2 cm *The Young Man and the Devil 30.7 x 20.6 cm *Coat of Arms with a Greyhound Supported by a Savage 7.7 cm in diameter *Gothic Canopy with Windows and Doors 41.6 x 28.1 cm *The Crucifixion *Death' 30.2 x 21.3 cm Legacy Master I.A.M.'s prints were often copied by contemporary engravers, but also by artists in other media. In particular the painter Gian Francesco da Tolmezzo based his fresco in Provesano (c. 1496) upon The Betrayal of Christ. Francisco Henriques also based paintings upon I.A.M.'s engravings.Biography of Francisco Henriques on the Web Gallery of Art Lucas van Leiden developed his style from that of Master I.A.M. and Albrecht D√ºrer. His prints were much sought after by prominent collectors. The English writer Samuel Pepys owned copies of the Piet√† and The Last Supper, and Ferdinand Columbus (the son of Christopher Columbus) owned a copy of Allegory of the Transience of Life.

Career Born in Chicago, Kirby broke into show business in the 1940s at the Club DeLisa, a South Side establishment that employed a variety-show format and preferred to hire local singers, dancers, and comedians. His first recording was as a stand-up blues singer, performing \\"Ice Man Blues\\" on a Tom Archia session done in 1947 for Aristocrat Records. He was one of the first African-American comedians to appeal to white as well as black audiences during the height of the Civil Rights era, appearing between 1963 and 1972 on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Jackie Gleason Show, The Temptations Show, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. As an impressionist, he mimicked‚Äîprovocatively for 1960s performance venues‚Äîwhite actors such as John Wayne and Walter Brennan rather than solely black stars such as Bill Cosby and Pearl Bailey. He also did vocal impressions of such singers as Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Williams. In 1970, he was allowed to produce The George Kirby Show, a television special, to gauge whether he could attract an audience for a weekly series. This led to his hosting Half the George Kirby Comedy Hour, a sketch comedy and variety show, which lasted for 22 episodes in 1972; it was one of the actor-comedian Steve Martin's first credits in front of the camera. The series was in many ways an uneasy compromise between Kirby's natural gifts and what the public would accept of black actors at the time; a regular feature was a shaggy dog story segment entitled the \\"Funky Fable\\". He was also a regular in the ABC series The Kopykats, with other impressionists such as Rich Little, Charlie Callas, Marilyn Michaels, and Frank Gorshin. Following the demise of his show, Kirby's career declined, especially as audiences began to look for more cutting-edge comedy. His career never again reached its former heights, but he did register featured guest appearances on Gimme a Break with Nell Carter, What's Happening Now!!, Crazy Like a Fox, and 227. In 1983 he did a USO tour with Bob Hope to entertain the troops in Beirut, Lebanon as part of the multinational peacekeeping force. Imprisonment Arrested in 1977 for selling cocaine and heroin to an undercover officer, Kirby served three and a half years in prison. After his release, he visited schools to tell students to stay off drugs. Death Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in his later years, Kirby made his last public appearance at an all-star benefit in May 1995 given by his friends for his mounting medical bills. On September 30, 1995, Kirby died of Parkinson's disease at a nursing home in Las Vegas. He was survived by his wife, Rosemary.

She is known for her memoir, Herculine Barbin, which was studied by Michel Foucault. Early life Most of what we know about Barbin comes from her later memoirs. Herculine Ad√©la√Øde Barbin was born in Saint- Jean-d'Ang√©ly in France in 1838. She was assigned as a girl and raised as such; her family named her Alexina. Her family was poor but she gained a charity scholarship to study in the school of an Ursuline convent. According to her account, she was enamoured of an aristocratic female friend in school. She regarded herself as unattractive but sometimes slipped into her friend's room at night and was sometimes punished for it. Her studies were successful and in 1856, at 17, she was sent to Le Ch√¢teau to study to become a teacher. There, she fell in love with one of her teachers. Puberty Although Barbin was in puberty, she had not begun to menstruate and remained flat chested. The hairs on her cheeks and upper lip were noticeable. In 1857 Barbin received a position as an assistant teacher in a girls' school. She fell in love with another teacher, Sara, and demanded that only Sara should dress her. Sara's ministrations turned into caresses and they became lovers. Eventually, rumors about their affair began to circulate. Barbin, although in poor health her whole life, began to suffer excruciating pains. When a doctor examined her, he was shocked and asked that she should be sent away from the school, but she stayed. Eventually, the devoutly Catholic Barbin confessed to Jean-Fran√ßois- Anne Landriot, the Bishop of La Rochelle. He asked Barbin's permission to break the confessional silence in order to send for a doctor to examine her. When Dr. Chesnet did so in 1860, he discovered that although Barbin had a small vagina, she had a masculine body type, a very small penis, and testicles inside her body. In 20th-century medical terms, she had male pseudohermaphroditism. Reassignment as male A later legal decision declared officially that Barbin was male. She left her lover and her job, changed her name to Abel Barbin and was briefly mentioned in the press. She moved to Paris where she lived in poverty and wrote her memoirs, reputedly as a part of therapy. In the memoirs, Barbin would use female pronouns when writing about her life prior to sexual redesignation and male pronouns, including Alexina and Camille, following the declaration. Nevertheless, Barbin clearly regarded herself as punished, and \\"disinherited\\", subject to a \\"ridiculous inquisition\\". In his commentary to Barbin's memoirs, Michel Foucault presented Barbin as an example of the \\"happy limbo of a non- identity\\", but whose masculinity marked her from her contemporaries. Morgan Holmes states that Barbin's own writings showed that she saw herself as an \\"exceptional female\\", but female nonetheless. Death In February 1868, the concierge of Barbin's house in rue de l'√âcole-de-M√©decine found her dead in her home. She had died by suicide by inhaling gas from her coal gas stove. The memoirs were found beside her bed. Memoirs publication Title page of Ambroise Tardieu's 1872 book in which excerpts of Herculine Barbin's memoirs were first published. Dr. Regnier reported the death, recovered the memoirs and performed an autopsy. Later he gave the memoirs to Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, who published excerpts as \\"Histoire et souvenirs d'Alexina B.\\" (\\"The Story and Memoirs of Alexina B.\\") in his book Question m√©dico-l√©gale de l'identit√© dans ses rapport avec les vices de conformation des organes sexuels, contenant les souvenirs et impressions d'un individu dont le sexe avait √©t√© m√©connu (\\"Forensics of Identity Involving Deformities of the Sexual Organs, along with the Memoirs and Impressions of an Individual whose Sex was Misidentified\\") (Paris: J.-B. Balli√®re et Fils, 1872). The excerpts were translated into English in 1980. Michel Foucault discovered the memoirs in the 1970s while conducting research at the French Department of Public Hygiene. He had the journals republished as Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite. In his edition, Foucault also included a set of medical reports, legal documents, and newspaper articles, as well as a short story adaptation by Oscar Panizza. Modern commentaries and references According to Morgan Holmes, the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt has identified Barbin as providing a crisis for \\"modern ideology\\" through an identification as neither male nor female, but Barbin's own writings describe a self-identification as female, albeit an exceptional female. Barbin's memoirs inspired the French film The Mystery of Alexina. Jeffrey Eugenides in his book Middlesex treats concurrent themes, as does Virginia Woolf in her book, Orlando: A Biography. Judith Butler refers to Foucault's commentary on Barbin at various points in her 1990 Gender Trouble, including her chapter \\"Foucault, Herculine, and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity.\\" Barbin appears as a character in the play A Mouthful of Birds by Caryl Churchill and David Lan. Barbin also appears as a character in the play Hidden: A Gender by Kate Bornstein. Herculine, a full-length play based on the memoirs of Barbin, is by Garrett Heater. Kira Obolensky also wrote a two-act stage adaptation entitled The Adventures of Herculina. In 2014, a manuscript entitled Dear Herculine by Aaron Apps won the 2014 Sawtooth Poetry Prize from Ahsahta Press. Commemoration The birthday of Herculine Barbin on 8 November is marked as Intersex Day of Remembrance.

It is the last human city on the planet Earth after a cataclysmic nuclear war between mankind and sentient machines, which resulted in artificial lifeforms dominating the world. It is actually a massive series of caverns deep under the ruined planet's surface, close to the planet's core, for warmth, power, and protection. Religious meaning Stephen Faller writes in Beyond the Matrix that Christianity is the most dominant religious theme in the Matrix films and that \\"Zion is biblically regarded as the city of God\\". The book Philosophers Explore the Matrix writes that \\"The last remaining human city, Zion, [is] synonymous in Judaism and Christianity with (the heavenly) Jerusalem\\". Racial matters Faller says that Zion is presented as a contrast to the Matrix, \\"The racial constituency of Zion is much less European and Anglo than present-day America. We are shifting the paradigm from the racially charged medium of the Matrix, where the subtext is so clearly contrasted in the extremes of black and white, to the imagined world of Zion, which is dominated by people of color.\\" One chapter in The Matrix Trilogy: Cyberpunk Reloaded writes, \\"Black spirituality is evoked in the Matrix films... by the use of Zion for the underground city of free humans populated primarily by black people, suggesting the dream of Christianised slaves to find a safe haven in 'the promised land' and the Rastafarian belief in an utopian society.\\" Another chapter writes, \\"The Matrix Reloaded displays black 'life' in a scene reminiscent of countless Hollywood jungle melodramas when the predominantly black population of Zion engages in frenzied dancing to the pounding rhythm of drums. In Hollywood, the war between artifice and reality is drawn along racial lines.\\" Adilifu Nama writes in Black Space: Imagining Race in Science Fiction Film, \\"The racial politics of Zion appears to be based on a multicultural model of racial equality and participation.

It is the seventh main installment in the Tekken franchise. It was released in arcades on November 26, 2007, as the first game running on the PlayStation 3-based System 357 arcade board. A year later, the game received an update, subtitled Bloodline Rebellion. Both versions also saw a limited release in North America. A home version based on the update was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 27, 2009. This was the first time a main installment was produced for a non-Sony console. It was ported for the PlayStation Portable on November 24, 2009. The game was produced by Katsuhiro Harada, who aimed to give the fights a strategic style while remaining faithful to the previous games in the series. While this version retains elements from the earlier games, Tekken 6 introduces a new Rage system that increases the strength of the player characters when their health gets low. It also features a beat 'em up mode focused on a soldier named Lars Alexandersson who leads a coup d'√©tat along with his underlings. Losing his memory in an attack against Jin Kazama's Mishima Zaibatsu special forces, Lars goes on a journey with a robot named Alisa Bosconovitch to learn his identity, so that he will be able to recover the subject of his mission. In this campaign mode, the player can win items by completing missions and enhance different power areas of any characters they choose to control. The game received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the visuals and the new fight mechanics but had mixed opinions about the handling of the Scenario Campaign. Nevertheless, the PSP port was also well-received for how faithful it was to the initial console versions. The game's sales have reached 3.5 million copies worldwide. It was later re-released with the spin-off Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Soulcalibur V for the PlayStation 3. A sequel, Tekken 7, was released to Japanese arcades on March 18, 2015, and was ported to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and released internationally on June 2, 2017. Gameplay Tekken 6 features bigger stages with more interactivity than its predecessors, including walls or floors that can be broken to reveal new fighting areas. The character customization feature has been enhanced, and certain items have implications in some aspects of the gameplay. A new Rage system gives characters more damage per hit when their vitality is below a certain point. Once activated, a reddish energy aura appears around the character, and their health bar starts to flicker in red. The Rage aura can be customized with different colors and effects to appear like fire, electricity, and ice, among others. Another newly added gameplay feature is the \\"bound\\" system. Every character has several moves that when used in a juggle combo will cause the opponent to be smashed hard into the ground, bouncing them off it in a stunned state, leaving them vulnerable to another combo or an additional attack. As of the Bloodline Rebellion update, successfully parrying a low attack will also put a character into a bound state. Lars facing two bosses in the campaign. The console versions (excluding the PSP version) include an extra beat 'em up mode titled \\"Scenario Campaign\\", which bears similarities with the \\"Tekken Force\\" and \\"Devil Within\\" modes from previous installments. In this mode, the player can move freely in an environment similar to that of a third-person role-playing game. Players can also pick up weapons like poles and Gatling guns, along with lootable items, money, and power-ups which can be found inside crates that are scattered throughout the playing environment. Players can move freely between fights, but when a group of enemies is encountered, the gameplay switches to the traditional, two-dimensional Tekken style. This mode originally included offline single player only, but on January 18, 2010, Namco released a patch that allows online co-op for the Scenario Campaign. Both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game include an online versus multiplayer mode over the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. It includes Ranked Matches mode, where the player can promote their character to a higher ranking, and Player Matches mode, where the player's fights are not ranked and they can invite friends to have matches with them. The game uses a proprietary graphics engine running at 60 frames per second as well as a dynamic physics engine named the \\"Octave Engine\\", which simulates fluid dynamics and among other things, allows water to behave realistically according to how the characters move. The graphics engine has been designed with a focus on character-animation to make movements look smoother and more realistic. This led to many animations being remade to either reflect the impact and damage caused, or to create new possibilities in gameplay. The developers considered animation extremely important for a fighting game and wanted to make the game \\"look good in motion\\", whereas previous installments had been designed to \\"look good on still shots\\". Since Bloodline Rebellion, the game has supported dynamic full-body motion blur, making Tekken 6 the first fighting game to do so. Plot Following Jin Kazama's victory against his great-grandfather, Jinpachi Mishima, in the previous King of Iron Fist Tournament, he is now the new head of the Mishima Zaibatsu special forces. Jin uses the company's resources to declare independence, becoming a global superpower, severing its national ties and openly declaring war against all nations over the following year. This action plunges the world into an extremely chaotic spiral, with a large-scale civil war erupting around the globe and even among the space colonies orbiting the planet. Meanwhile, Kazuya Mishima, Jin's father, who has risen to lead G Corporation, places a bounty on his son's head. In retaliation, Jin announces the sixth King of Iron Fist Tournament to lure Kazuya out. As the war continues to erupt, the field leader of Mishima Zaibatsu's Tekken Force, Lars Alexandersson, has rebelled from the army along with several of his soldiers. However, Lars loses his memory during an attack by the G Corporation and spends some time recovering it. Accompanied by an android, Alisa Bosconovitch, Lars ventures throughout the world, avoiding the Mishima Zaibatsu's manhunt for him while also trying to recover his past. It is eventually revealed that Lars is actually the illegitimate son of Heihachi Mishima, who has gone into hiding since his supposed demise in the last tournament, and has been trying to take the Mishima Zaibatsu from Jin's hands. After coming into contact with several allies, including his adoptive brother, Lee Chaolan, Lars confronts the G Corporation and Mishima Zaibatsu's headquarters. Jin reveals he had sent Alisa to spy on Lars' actions all along. Disabling Alisa's safe mode, Lars is forced to confront his former teammate, who leaves with Jin to Egypt. Helped by one of his allies, Raven, Lars goes to Egypt. He meets an astrologist named Zafina who provides them with information about the clash of two evil stars that will awake an ancient evil who will destroy the world. This evil, Azazel, is a demonic monster responsible for giving birth to the Devil Gene and is currently bound in an ancient temple. Lars confronts his half-brother Kazuya in front of the door leading to Azazel's chamber and fights him. Lars and Raven enter the chamber and confront Azazel, whom they seemingly defeat. Outside the temple, Lars confronts his half-nephew Jin, who admits that his reason for launching the war was to awaken Azazel and destroy him, freeing the world from a greater threat than the war itself. Also, in doing this, he would free himself from the Devil Gene, as Azazel can only have a physical form through negative energies of the world. Revealing Azazel can only be destroyed by someone with the Devil Gene, Jin confronts and attacks the revived Azazel, sending them both plummeting to the desert. Lars is reunited with a now safe Alisa, who has been fixed by Lee since her previous destruction, and goes on another mission. Raven unearths Jin's body in the desert and notes that Jin still has the Devil mark on his arm, implying that Azazel's demise did not free him from the Devil Gene. Characters The game features a total of 39 original playable characters in Tekken 6 in arcade version, and 41 in Bloodline Rebellion and the console version. Seven new characters are introduced in Tekken 6, but two are not playable bosses, and in \\"Bloodline Rebellion\\" and the console version two additional characters.

The first trailer was revealed at Sony's E3 press conference that year. According to Video Games Daily, feedback from the first trailer was negative. However, project director Katsuhiro Harada said at that time the team was not working on Tekken 6 full-time because they were busy developing Tekken Dark Resurrection. Harada's main concern with Tekken 6 was that it appeal to newcomers and older players. The game was released in Japanese arcades on November 26, 2007. It was the first game running on the PlayStation 3-based System 357 arcade board. Harada said Namco decided to make a Tekken installment for the Xbox 360 because of multiple fan requests. Response to the original arcade game was highly positive, but Harada said the team aimed to make more improvements to attract new players. He noted that feedback from the arcade's release in Japan had surpassed that of previous titles. For the updated release, the team wanted to include more playable characters than in Tekken 5, make the techniques unique as well as more intuitive, and make the fights as brutal as possible. However, Harada revealed they had encountered difficulties making the cast balanced. As a result, Namco took notes from the characters' victories in the original arcades and modified the cast and rebalanced the game. To make battles more strategic, the Rage system was created. Another new element is the use of items by the characters. While Harada did not find this as unique as the Rage System, he felt it added more to the battles' fun factor. Like some games in the Mortal Kombat series, Tekken 6 is notable for adding the element that allows players to throw enemies down to another area of the stage. This was added to create longer combos if the player has the opportunity, not for the sole purpose of inflicting more damage. A major obstacle in producing the game was Namco's idea to include game modes that allowed four simultaneous characters. This took major rework, especially for online mode. They avoided this for the spinoff Tekken Tag Tournament, which only allowed alternating use of four fighters. Director Yuichi Yonemori also noted that the team wanted to make fights faster while adding these new mechanics. To provide more variety, each stage that could be destroyed was given its own sound effect and each character also had their own. On October 23, 2009, Namco Bandai released a Tekken 6 themed Game Space on the North American version of PlayStation Home. Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion was first released as Tekken 6 to Japanese arcades on December 18, 2008. It featured new characters, stages, items and customization options and gave the game a balance update to its characters and items. The console version of Tekken 6 is based on this arcade version and was released for consoles, but under the name Tekken 6. In October 2009, Namco announced the game's development had been completed, and it would be released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. The online elements of Tekken 6 were based on the ones from Tekken: Dark Resurrection. Harada announced the game's roster would be the largest in the series, and that after Tekken 3 they were paying special attention to make sure each character is unique in appearance, personality and techniques and does not overlap with other characters.Tekken 6...developing new characters,\\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine (January 2009): 47. Preorders of the game included an artbook and a wireless controller. Multiple guest artists designed alternative costumes. This one illustrates Masashi Kishimoto's sketch of Lars which would be used in a Naruto game from CyberConnect2 This new version features two new characters: Alisa Bosconovitch, an android built in the image of Dr. Bosconovitch's deceased daughter, and Lars Alexandersson, Heihachi Mishima's illegitimate son and leader of a rebellious Tekken Force faction fighting Jin's tyranny. This expansion also features a number of new items and customization options for characters to use during fights. Unlike previous console games, all the characters are unlocked when the game starts. Harada said the reason behind this was his belief that unlocking characters was outdated, and that online gamers would find their favorite characters faster. Unlike other new Tekken 6 characters who were based on fan input, both Lars and Alisa were created using a different approach, focusing on their importance to the game's story. As a result, in the arcade version of Tekken 6, most of Lars' identity was kept a mystery, leaving it to the console versions' Scenario Campaign mode to explain his role in the series, with Harada teasing about his potential attack on Jin Kazama's forces. Jin's characterization was changed from an anti-hero to a villain, something Harada had been planning to develop for years. However, his change of personality remained a secret to be explored in the story. Harada referred to the Scenario Campaign as a logical addition to the game. He believes the franchise is known for including bonus content in each installment, besides just being a recreation of the arcade game. He said the mode was meant to help the game appeal to a larger audience. A number of artists joined the team to create new outfits for a few characters: Lars, Jin, Kazuya and Zafina were also given additional outfits designed by Masashi Kishimoto, Clamp, Takayuki Yamaguchi and Mutsumi Inomata, respectively. Outfits for Anna Williams and Asuka Kazama were made by Mamoru Nagano, and Ito Ogure did one for Lili Rochefort. Although the scenario campaign was removed from the PlayStation Portable's port, the developers added background information for the characters in the arcade mode. Makoto Iwai, chief operating officer of Namco Bandai, said the developers tried to make the PlayStation Portable contain as much content as the original console versions. For this reason, the PSP port has new modes and stages not present in the original one. In late 2009, Harada hinted at the possibility of the game having downloadable content but said that whenever possible it would be made available free of charge. In January 2019, Tekken 6 became playable on the Xbox One, thanks to its backwards compatibility function. =Music= Tekken 6 features a large cast of composers, including: Rio Hamamoto, Ryuichi Takada, Keiichi Okabe, Kazuhiro Nakamura, Shinji Hosoe, Yoshihito Yano, Ayako Saso, Go Shiina, Satoru K≈çsaki, Akitaka Tohyama, Hitoshi Sakimoto, Masaharu Iwata, Yoshimi Kudo, Noriyuki Kamikura, Azusa Chiba, Kimihiro Abe, Mitsuhiro Kaneda, Keigo Hoashi, Keiki Kobayashi, and Kakeru Ishihama. Two soundtracks based on the main game and the PSP port were released. Shiina was in charge of the low key tracks. In retrospect he remembers enjoying the music for the game, most notably when rearranging tracks and composing a theme for Alisa. Reception Critical response to Tekken 6 among reviewers has been generally favorable, with the PS3 version scoring a 79 on Metacritic and the 360 an 80. IGN praised the additions to the game's mechanics and modes, as well as the large cast, which they felt should appeal to most gamers. GameSpot agreed, liking the new additions to the roster, most notably Zafina for her look and moveset. They noted that Tekken fans would enjoy the new mechanics as these meant practicing more combo styles, such as juggle combos. On the other hand, Eurogamer was more negative, stating that by the time the game was released there were other more appealing fighting games. At the same time, they conceded that it was far more popular than those in the East. They found the graphics superior to the recent fighter Soulcalibur IV but not as good as those of Virtua Fighter 5. Nevertheless, Eurogamer felt the returning characters' combos felt familiar, and long-time players would enjoy playing them. VideoGamer.com made a similar comparison noting that while other fighting games might entertain gamers more, Tekken 6 was faithful to the series' roots. This included its use of intense motion which the reviewer found easy to learn, though they had mixed opinions about the new mechanics that had to be learned. The PlayStation 3 version of the game garnered some criticism for its excessive load times when run without installing it previously, and its initially laggy online multiplayer component, which was later improved via updates. At first 1UP.com was negative towards the game's poor online mode, but once Namco patched it the score was revised upward. The game's Scenario Campaign mode was subject to mixed criticism as well. IGN regarded it as a disappointment, citing bland environments and repetitive enemies. VideoGamer.com also criticized the mode, saying it was not fun, and the plot involving the Mishima family was not enjoyable. GameSpy praised the game for its variety of traits taken from different types of games. GameSpot gave the plot-oriented Scenario Campaign mode far more positive comments, as well as the amount of replay value provided by the possibility of playing other characters besides Lars. Game Revolution also had mixed opinions. They noted the camera had some issues that might affect the moves' input‚Äîmoves like Kazuya Mishima's Spinning Demon‚Äîwhich could easily still be performed to take down enemies without difficulties. The reviewer compared the style of the Campaign to role-playing games, referring to the way the player can power up the characters. The PSP version received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving it 82 out of 100. IGN said the portable version had greatly improved loading times compared to its console counterparts. GameZone regarded it as the \\"definitive version of the game\\", despite lacking the Scenario Campaign and the graphics of the main console; the port still managed to retain good graphics, the console's d-pad was felt to be far more useful than the one in the Xbox 360 controller. GameSpot and Eurogamer also shared similar opinions on how the PSP port managed to impress, retaining the large cast, and for its responsive controls. During its first week, the PlayStation 3 version of Tekken 6 sold 103,000 units in Japan. According to Media Create, this made it the fastest-selling fighter. It remained so until August 2012 when the PS3 port of Persona 4 Arena broke the record with sales of 180,000 units. In May 2011, Namco Bandai reported it had become its best-selling game from 2010 with 1.5 million units sold. The game got to number three on the UK sales charts. In North America, the game sold over one million units as of August 2010. Upon its release in Japan, the PSP port sold 25,131 units. As of May 2011, Tekken 6 has sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide. In 2009, Tekken 6 was nominated for a Spike Fighting Game of the Year award but lost to Street Fighter IV. However, it still won the Best PSP Fighting Game and Best PSP Fighting Game Readers' Choice from IGN. =Legacy= In retrospective, Harada believes Tekken 6, and Tekken 5, managed to attract a new group of fans, something Tekken 4 failed to do. For this game, Lars was given an alternate design created by manga author Masashi Kishimoto, famous for writing the series Naruto. In 2009, CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama read in a Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he should be included in the Naruto video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to allow him to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff began assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast. The first CGI scene from the game also influenced the developers to create a film titled Tekken: Blood Vengeance which uses this type of animation. At the MCM London Comic Con 2009, a Tekken 6 player named Eliot Smith-Walters was awarded the Guinness World Record for the longest winning streak in Tekken 6, having won 68 consecutive matches. Tekken 6 was followed by a spin-off titled Tekken Tag Tournament 2. A sequel, titled Tekken 7, was announced on July 13, 2014. More information on the sequel was made available during Bandai Namco's panel at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International event. The game had a limited arcade release in Japan on February 18, 2015, followed by a full release on March 18, 2015. Harada states that Tekken 7s story mode was influenced by the Scenario Campaign from Tekken 6 as he believes recent games in the franchise have tried elaborating more on the series' storytelling despite being a fighting game. Tekken 6 was rereleased in 2015 with Tag Tournament 2 and Soulcalibur V as PlayStation 3 Fighting Edition for its title console.

It is also referred to as Iconophilism (also Iconophily or Iconophilia ‚Üê ‚Äì icon (image) + ‚Äì love) designating a positive attitude towards the religious use of icons. In the history of Christianity, Iconodulism (or Iconophilism) was manifested as a moderate position, between two extremes: Iconoclasm (radical opposition to the use of icons) and Iconolatry (idolatric veritable (full) adoration of icons). History \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy\\" under the Byzantine empress Theodora over Iconoclasm in 843. (National Icon Collection 18, British Museum). In contrary to the moderate or respectful adoration, various forms of latria of icons (iconolatry) were also starting to appear, mainly in popular worship. Since veritable (full) adoration was reserved for God only, such attitude towards icons as objects was seen as a form of idolatry. In reaction to that, the idolatric misuse of icons was criticized and by the beginning of the 8th century some radical forms of criticism (iconoclasm) were also starting to emerge, advocating not only against adoration of icons, but also against any form of adoration and use of icons in religious life. The iconoclastic controversy emerged in the Byzantine Empire and lasted during the 8th and the 9th centuries. The most famous iconodules (proponents of the veneration of icons) during that time were saints John of Damascus and Theodore the Studite. The controversy was instigated by Byzantine Emperor Leo III in 726, when he ordered the removal of the image of Christ above the Chalke Gate of the imperial palace in Constantinople.Lowden, John. (1997) Early Christian and Byzantine Art. London: Phaidon Press, p. 155. A wider prohibition of icons followed in 730. St. John of Damascus argued successfully that to prohibit the use of icons was tantamount to denying the incarnation, the presence of the Word of God in the material world.

The Restoration of Image-Worship by the Seventh Oecumenical Council, 787. for icons was established by the Second Council of Nicaea (Seventh Ecumenical Council) in 787.

The last outburst of iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire was overcome at the Council of Constantinople in 843, which reaffirmed the adoration of icons in an event celebrated as the Feast of Orthodoxy. The Council of Trent (XIX Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church) in 1563 confirmed iconodulism. But this Council, unlike the Council of Nicaea, used a different expression in relation to the icons: ¬´honor and veneration¬ª ().

It is the first game in the Galactic Saga and became first game published by Br√∏derbund which was, in fact, created for the purpose of publishing the game. Galactic Empire was ported to the Apple II and the Atari 8-bit family and followed by three sequels. The game was also published by Adventure International. Description Doug Carlston was an attorney who wrote Galactic Empire on his TRS-80. Adventure International was the original publisher; after his brother Gary began successfully selling the game to computer stores, they founded Br√∏derbund. Many of the locations have names taken from African languages, such as Afrikaans or Swahili, based on Doug Carlston's years in Africa. The game navigation uses a list of planets with names beginning with a unique letter of the alphabet for easy access. The 'R' key is reserved for 'Return', and 'Q' for 'Quit.' The player has one fleet which travels from planet to planet, beginning with the home world 'Galactica.' Conquered planets can be taxed and produce troops used to take other planets. Each planet has a technology level above or below Galactica standard, which makes it easier or harder to conquer. It takes time to travel between planets to collect taxes and troops to conquer new planets. The player has 999 years to take the galaxy. Reception J.

It is based on the willingness to pay principle ‚Äì the most accurate measure of the value of a good or service is what people are willing to give up in order to get it. A shadow price is often calculated based on certain assumptions, and so it is subjective and somewhat inaccurate. The origin of these costs typically costs that are external to a market or an unwillingness to recalculate a system to account for marginal production. For example, consider a firm that already has a factory full of equipment and staff. They might estimate the shadow price for a few more units of production as simply the cost of the overtime. In this way, some goods and services have near zero shadow prices, for example information goods. Less formally, a shadow price can be thought of as the cost of decisions made at the margin without consideration for the total cost. Although shadow pricing may be inaccurate, it is still often used in cost-benefit analyses. For example, before defining a project, businesses and governments may want to weigh the costs and benefits of the project to decide whether the project is worthwhile. While tangible costs and benefits such as the cost of labor are easy to quantify, intangible costs and benefits such as the number of hours saved is much more difficult to quantify. In this case, business owners and policymakers turn to shadow pricing to determine what these intangibles are. There are usually many tools to estimate monetary values of these intangibles. They include contingent valuation, revealed preferences, and hedonic pricing.  Constrained optimization  In constrained optimization in economics, the shadow price is the change, per infinitesimal unit of the constraint, in the optimal value of the objective function of an optimization problem obtained by relaxing the constraint. If the objective function is utility, it is the marginal utility of relaxing the constraint. If the objective function is cost, it is the marginal cost of strengthening the constraint. In a business application, a shadow price is the maximum price that management is willing to pay for an extra unit of a given limited resource.Shadow Price: Definition and Much More from Answers.com For example, if a production line is already operating at its maximum 40-hour limit, the shadow price would be the maximum price the manager would be willing to pay for operating it for an additional hour, based on the benefits he would get from this change. In advance of adequate regulation or market pricing for some commodity items, conservative organizations will place on their balance sheets a value they believe to be an accurate reflection of the value of those items to their operations. This is common for companies with a large carbon footprint or water footprint. As an example Microsoft has placed a $27/ton price on its carbon emissions which is then billed to the P&L; of its individual business units and used to fund the company's renewable energy and efficiency programs.\\"Carbon Shadow Pricing\\" from www.ClimateMoneyPolicy.com\\"Carbon Shadow Pricing\\" Via www.LinkedIn.com More formally, the shadow price is the value of the Lagrange multiplier at the optimal solution, which means that it is the infinitesimal change in the objective function arising from an infinitesimal change in the constraint. This follows from the fact that at the optimal solution the gradient of the objective function is a linear combination of the constraint function gradients with the weights equal to the Lagrange multipliers. Each constraint in an optimization problem has a shadow price or dual variable.  Cost- benefit analysis  Shadow pricing is frequently used to figure out the monetary values of intangibles which are hard to quantify factors during cost- benefit analyses. In the context of public economics, shadow pricing is very useful for governments and policymakers to evaluate whether a public project should be pursued. This is because public goods are very rarely exchanged in the market, making it difficult to determine its price. To help determine the monetary value of these goods, these three tools are often used. Take the example of a government determining whether it wants to undertake a freeway project that would save commuters 500,000 hours a year, save 5 lives a year, and reduce air pollution due to decreased congestion but with a present value cost of $250 million. = Contingent valuation = Contingent valuation estimates the value a person places on a good by asking him or her directly. It is essentially surveys for individuals on how much they would be willing to pay for some intangible benefits or to avoid some intangible harms. Typically, these surveys contain detailed descriptions of hypothetical public goods or services, ask respondents how much they would pay for it, and collect relevant demographic data of these respondents. Some common types of these survey questions include: open-ended, referendum-type, payment-card type, and double- bounded referendum-type. The advantage of contingent valuation is that it is sometimes the only feasible method for valuing a public good. This is especially the case when there is no obvious market price that one can use to determine the value. On the other hand, there are also many disadvantages of this method. For instance, how the survey is structured and how the questions are framed can lead to widely varying results and can induce bias into the results. Other times, the respondents may simply have no idea how much they value the public good in question. In the freeway project example, policymakers can design a survey that asks respondents on how much they would pay to save a certain period of time or to spend less time in traffic. However, respondents may find it difficult or uncomfortable to put a value on a life. = Revealed preferences = Revealed preferences are based on observations on real world behaviors to determine how much individuals place on non-monetary outcomes. In other words, observing individuals' purchasing behaviors is the best way to determine their preferences. It assumes that individuals have made their purchasing decisions over other alternatives ‚Äì making their final purchases the preferred one. It also allows room for the preferred choice to vary depending on the prices and the budgetary constraints. As such, by varying prices and budgetary constraints, a schedule can be created of an individual's/individuals' preferred choices under certain prices and constraints. The advantage of revealed preferences is that it reduces biases that contingent valuation may bring. As it is based on real- world behaviors, it is much harder for individuals to manipulate or guess-work their answers. On the other hand, this tool also has its limits. For example, it is difficult to control for other factors that may make one prefer a choice over another. It also fails to fully incorporate indifference between two equally preferred choices. In the freeway project example, where contingent valuation may fall short in determining how much individuals value lives, revealed preferences may be better suited. For instance, policymakers can look at how much more individuals need to be paid to take on riskier jobs that increase the probability of fatality. However, the drawbacks with revealed preferences also arise ‚Äì in this case, if the riskier jobs increase the probability of not only death but also injury, or are also unpleasant in other respects, the higher wages may incorporate the other factors, misrepresenting the result. = Hedonic pricing = Hedonic pricing is a model that uses regression analysis to isolate the value of a specific intangible cost or benefit. It is based on the premise that that price is determined by both internal characteristics and external factors. It also assumes that individuals value the characteristics of a good rather than the good itself, which implies that price will reflect a set of internal and external characteristics. It is most often used to calculate variances in housing prices that reflect the value of local environmental factors. The model is based on widely-available and relatively accurate market data, making this method uncontroversial and inexpensive to use. As such, one of hedonic pricing's main advantages is that it can be used to estimate values on actual choices. This method is also very versatile and can be adapted to incorporate multiple other interactions with other factors. However, one of its major downfalls is that it is rather limited ‚Äì it can mostly only measure things that are related to housing prices. It also assumes that individuals have the freedom and power to select the preferred combination given their income but in actuality, this may not be the case as the market may be influenced by changes in taxes and interest rates. In the freeway project example, hedonic pricing may be useful to value the benefits of reduced air pollution. It can run a regression of home values on clean air with a variety of control variables that can include home size, age of home, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, crime statistics, school qualities, etc. Hedonic pricing may also be considered in quantifying the monetary value of time saved. It can run a regression of home values on proximity to work with a similar set of control variables. = Illustration #1 = Suppose a consumer with utility function u faces prices \\\\,\\\\\\\\! p_1,p_2 and is endowed with income \\\\,\\\\\\\\!m.

Forming the Lagrangian auxiliary function L(x_1,x_2,\\\\lambda):= u(x_1,x_2)+\\\\lambda(m-p_1x_1-p_2x_2), taking first-order conditions and solving for its saddle point we obtain x^*_1, \\\\, x^*_2,\\\\, \\\\lambda^* which satisfy : \\\\lambda^* = \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(x^*_1,x^*_2)}{\\\\partial x_1} \\\\right/ p_1= \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(x^*_1,x^*_2)}{\\\\partial x_2} \\\\right/ p_2. This gives us a clear interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier in the context of consumer maximization. If the consumer is given an extra unit of income (the budget constraint is relaxed) at the optimal consumption level where the marginal utility per unit of income for each good is equal to \\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\lambda^* as above, then the change in maximal utility per unit of additional income will be equal to \\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\lambda^* since at the optimum the consumer gets the same amount of marginal utility per unit of income from spending his additional income on either good. = Illustration #2 = Holding prices fixed, if we define the indirect utility function as : U(p_1,p_2,m) = \\\\max \\\\\\\\{\\\\,\\\\\\\\!u(x_1,x_2)\\\\mbox:\\\\mboxp_1x_1+p_2x_2=m\\\\\\\\}, then we have the identity :\\\\,\\\\\\\\! U(p_1,p_2,m)=u(x_1^*(p_1,p_2,m),x_2^*(p_1,p_2,m)), where \\\\,\\\\\\\\! x_1^*(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot),x_2^*(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) are the demand functions, i.e. x_i^*(p_1,p_2,m) = \\\\arg\\\\max \\\\\\\\{\\\\,\\\\\\\\!u(x_1,x_2)\\\\mbox:\\\\mboxp_1x_1+p_2x_2=m\\\\\\\\} \\\\mbox{ for } i=1,2. Now define the optimal expenditure function :\\\\,\\\\\\\\! E(p_1,p_2,m) =p_1x_1^*(p_1,p_2,m)+p_2x_2^*(p_1,p_2,m). Assume differentiability and that \\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\lambda^* is the solution at \\\\,\\\\\\\\! p_1,p_2,m, then we have from the multivariate chain rule: :\\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial m} =\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x_1^*}{\\\\partial m} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x_2^*}{\\\\partial m} =\\\\lambda^* p_1\\\\frac{\\\\partial x_1^*}{\\\\partial m} + \\\\lambda^* p_2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_2^*}{\\\\partial m}=\\\\lambda^* \\\\left(p_1\\\\frac{\\\\partial x_1^*}{\\\\partial m} + p_2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_2^*}{\\\\partial m} \\\\right) =\\\\lambda^* \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial m}. Now we may conclude that :\\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\lambda^* = \\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial m}{\\\\partial E/\\\\partial m} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\text{optimal utility }}{\\\\Delta \\\\text{optimal expenditure}}. This again gives the obvious interpretation, one extra unit of optimal expenditure will lead to \\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\lambda^* units of optimal utility.

Hanaoka is said to have been the first to perform surgery using general anesthesia. History Hanaoka studied medicine in Kyoto, and became a medical practitioner in Wakayama prefecture, located near Osaka, where he was born. Seish≈´ Hanaoka learned traditional Japanese medicine as well as Dutch- imported European surgery. Due to the nation's self-imposed isolation policy of Sakoku, few foreign medical texts were permitted into Japan at that time. This limited the exposure of Hanaoka and other Japanese physicians to Western medical developments. Perhaps the most notable Japanese surgeon of the Edo period, Hanaoka was famous for combining Dutch and Japanese surgery and introducing modern surgical techniques to Japan. Hanaoka successfully operated for hydrocele, anal fistula, and even performed certain kinds of plastic surgery. He was the first surgeon in the world who used the general anaesthesia in surgery and who dared to operate on cancers of the breast and oropharynx, to remove necrotic bone, and to perform amputations of the extremities in Japan. Hua Tuo and mafeisan Hua Tuo, Chinese surgeon, circa AD 200 Hua Tuo (ËèØ‰Ωó, ca. AD 145-220) was a Chinese surgeon of the 2nd century AD. According to the Records of Three Kingdoms (ca. AD 270) and the Book of the Later Han (ca. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of herbal extracts he called mafeisan (È∫ªÊ≤∏Êï£). Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as resection of gangrenous intestines. Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic potion, probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of unconsciousness and partial neuromuscular blockade. The exact composition of mafeisan, similar to all of Hua Tuo's clinical knowledge, was lost when he burned his manuscripts, just before his death. The composition of the anesthetic powder was not mentioned in either the Records of Three Kingdoms or the Book of the Later Han. Because Confucian teachings regarded the body as sacred and surgery was considered a form of body mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in ancient China. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death. The name mafeisan combines ma (È∫ª, meaning \\"cannabis, hemp, numbed or tingling\\"), fei (Ê≤∏, meaning \\"boiling or bubbling\\"), and san (Êï£, meaning \\"to break up or scatter\\", or \\"medicine in powder form\\"). Therefore, the word mafeisan probably means something like \\"cannabis boil powder\\". Many sinologists and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine have guessed at the composition of Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula is believed to have contained some combination of: *bai zhi (Angelica dahurica), *cao wu (ËçâÁÉè, Aconitum kusnezoffii, Aconitum kusnezoffii, Kusnezoff's monkshood, or wolfsbane root), *chuƒÅn xi≈çng (Ligusticum wallichii, or Szechuan lovage), *dong quai (Angelica sinensis, or \\"female ginseng\\"), *wu tou (ÁÉèÈ†≠, Aconitum carmichaelii, rhizome of Aconitum, or Chinese monkshood\\"), *yang jin hua (Ê¥ãÈáëËä±, Flos Daturae metelis, or Datura stramonium, jimson weed, devil's trumpet, thorn apple, locoweed, moonflower), *ya pu lu (Mandragora officinarum) *rhododendron flower, and *jasmine root. Others have suggested the potion may have also contained hashish, bhang, shang-luh, or opium. Victor H. Mair wrote that mafei \\"appears to be a transcription of some Indo-European word related to \\"morphine\\".\\" Some authors believe that Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by acupuncture, and that mafeisan either had nothing to do with or was simply an adjunct to his strategy for anesthesia. Many physicians have attempted to re-create the same formulation based on historical records but none have achieved the same clinical efficacy as Hua Tuo's. In any event, Hua Tuo's formula did not appear to be effective for major operations. Formulation of ts≈´sensan Datura stramonium, also known as Korean morning glory, thorn apple or jimson weed) Hanaoka was intrigued when he learned about Hua Tuo's mafeisan potion. Beginning in about 1785, Hanaoka embarked on a quest to re-create a compound that would have pharmacologic properties similar to Hua Tuo's mafeisan. His wife, who participated in his experiments as a volunteer, lost her sight due to adverse side effects. After years of research and experimentation, he finally developed a formula which he named ts≈´sensan (also known as mafutsu-san). Like that of Hua Tuo, this compound was composed of extracts of several different plants, including: *8 parts yang jin hua (Datura stramonium, Korean morning glory, thorn apple, jimson weed, devil's trumpet, stinkweed, or locoweed); *2 parts bai zhi (Angelica dahurica); *2 parts cao wu (Aconitum sp., monkshood or wolfsbane); *2 parts chuƒÅn ban xia (Pinellia ternata); *2 parts chuƒÅn xi≈çng (Ligusticum wallichii, Cnidium rhizome, Cnidium officinale or Szechuan lovage); *2 parts dong quai (Angelica sinensis or female ginseng); *1 part tian nan xing (Arisaema rhizomatum or cobra lily). Some sources claim that Angelica archangelica (often referred to as garden angelica, holy ghost, or wild celery) was also an ingredient. Reportedly the mixture was ground to a paste, boiled in water, and administered as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on the dosage, they might remain unconscious for 6‚Äì24 hours. The active ingredients in ts≈´sensan were scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, ts≈´sensan produced a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis. Shutei Nakagawa (1773‚Äì1850), a close friend of Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet entitled \\"Mayaku-ko\\" (\\"narcotic powder\\") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia. Use of ts≈´sensan as a general anesthetic Once perfected, Hanaoka began to administer his new sedative drink to induce a state of consciousness equivalent to or approximating that of modern general anesthesia to his patients. Kan Aiya (ËóçÂ±ãÂãò) was a 60-year-old woman whose family was beset by breast cancer - Kan being the last of her kin alive. On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial mastectomy for breast cancer on Kan Aiya, using ts≈´sensan as a general anesthetic. This is regarded today by some as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia. Nearly forty years would pass before Crawford Long used general anesthesia in Jefferson, Georgia. Hanaoka's success in performing this painless operation soon became widely known, and patients began to arrive from all parts of Japan. Hanaoka went on to perform many operations using ts≈´sensan, including resection of malignant tumors, extraction of bladder stones, and extremity amputations. Before his death in 1835, Hanaoka performed more than 150 operations for breast cancer. He also devised and modified surgical instruments, and trained and educated many students, using his own philosophy for medical management. Hanaoka attracted many students, and his surgical techniques became known as the Hanaoka method. Publications Image from \\"Surgical Casebook\\" (Kishitsu gery≈ç zukan) by Hanaoka Seishu Hanaoka wrote the following works. None of these were printed books. Rather (as was the custom in Japan at that time), they were all handwritten manuscripts which were later reproduced by his students for their personal use. *1805: Nyuigan chiken-roku, a one-volume book that provides a detailed description of Hanaoka's first operation for mammary carcinoma. *1805: Nyugan saijo shujutsu- zu, a one-volume book that provides a detailed description of Hanaoka's first operation for mammary carcinoma. *1809: Nyuigan zufu, an illustrated emakimono in one roll which also pictured breast cancer. *1820: Geka tekiyio, a one volume text. *1838: Hanaoka-ke chiken zumaki, an illustrated emakimono scroll depicting 86 different cases, including surgical resection of fibromas and elephantiasis of the genitalia.). *Date unknown: Hanaoka-shi chijitsu zushiki, a one-volume illustrated book that depicts his operations for the treatment of conditions such as phimosis, arthritis, necrosis, choanal atresia, and hemorrhoids. *Date unknown: Seishuiidan, a series of essays on Hanaoka's medical and surgical experiences. *Date unknown: Yoka hosen, a one volume text. *Date unknown: Yoka shinsho, a one volume text on surgery. *Date unknown: Yoka sagen, a two volume text on surgery. The surgical teachings of Hanaoka were also preserved in a series of eight handwritten books by unnamed pupils, but known to us by the following titles: Shoka shinsho, Shoka sagen, Kinso yojutsu, Kinso kuju, Geka chakuyo, Choso benmei, Nyuiganben, and Koho benran. No dates are known for any of these writings. Since Hanaoka himself made only manuscript copies and none were ever published, it is doubtful if many copies of his surgical writings are now extant. Legacy Though some of his patients are said to have benefited from Hanaoka's work, it apparently had no impact upon the development of general anesthesia in the rest of the world. The national isolation policy of the Tokugawa shogunate prevented Hanaoka's achievements from being publicized until after the isolation ended in 1854. By that time, different techniques for general anesthesia had already been independently developed by American and European scientists and physicians. The Japan Society of Anesthesiologists however has incorporated a representation of the Korean morning glory flower in their logo in honor of Hanaoka's pioneering work. Hanaoka's house has been preserved in his hometown (Naga-cho, Kinokawa, Wakayama). It has various interactive exhibits in both Japanese and English. It is adjacent to a nursing college, and many locally trained doctors and nurses pay homage to Hanaoka and his works. Popular culture The Japanese author Sawako Ariyoshi wrote a novel entitled The Doctor's Wife (Japanese ËèØÂ≤°ÈùíÊ¥≤„ÅÆÂ¶ª), based on the actual life of Hanaoka Seish≈´ mixed with a fictional conflict between his mother and his wife. The novel was subsequently filmed as a 1967 movie directed by Yasuzo Masumura, Hanaoka Seish≈´ no tsuma (aka \\"The Wife of Seishu Hanaoka\\").

The company was experimenting with new engine technologies, including Wankel engines, diesel engines, and turbochargers, and used the basic C111 platform as a testbed. Other experimental features included multi- link rear suspension, gull-wing doors and a luxurious interior with leather trim and air conditioning. The first version of the C111 was completed in 1969. The car used a fiberglass body shell and with a mid-mounted three-rotor direct fuel injected Wankel engine (code named M950F). The next C111 appeared in 1970. It used a four-rotor engine producing 257 kW (350 hp). The car reportedly could reach a speed of .C111/II Technical Data at Mercedes-Benz.com The company decided not to adopt the Wankel engine and turned to diesel experiments for the second and third C111s. The C111-IID produced and was based on the 240D W115 model OM616 engine. The C111-III was powered by a at 4,500 rpm straight-five OM617 turbocharged diesel that broke nine diesel and gasoline speed records. With more aerodynamic bodywork that gave it an air drag coefficient of 0.191, the C111 eventually reached at the Nard√≤ Ring in 1978, and averaged 16.0 liters/100 km at 316 km/h (14.7 mpg at 195.4 mph) over a 12-hour cruise. A later 4.8 L twin KKK-turbocharged V8 version set another record, with an average lap-speed of 403.78 km/h (250.958 mph). This was achieved by Hans Liebold in 1 minute, 56.67 seconds on May 5, 1979. Total production was 16 cars: 13 first and second generation Wankel engined cars, 2 diesel engined third generation cars used in the Nardo record attempt, and a single V8 engined fourth generation car.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk4H1eV9JuY Mercedes-Benz introduced the C112 at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1991 as a proposed production sports car.

The drama tells the lives of pilots working for the fictional Solar Airways based on Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific. It has been cited as one of TVB's best serial dramas, and there were plans for a sequel to be filmed in 2006. However, it was delayed due to negotiations with an airline to provide support. In May 2011, TVB announced that a sequel was in development, with filming beginning in the early months of 2012. The sequel, titled Triumph in the Skies II, aired on TVB Jade on 15 July 2013. Triumph in the Skies has been compared to the now- cancelled NBC series LAX. It sparked an interest in aviation when first aired amongst Hong Kong viewers, as well as an interest in a small doll named \\"Triangel\\" featured early on in the series. Location filming included Japan, Italy, and Australia, with sequence shots at Parafield Airport in Adelaide being memorable for their in-depth depiction of flight training.

It is an acetoxyethyl ester prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective orally. The activity depends on in vivo hydrolysis and release of cefuroxime tablets. It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1987.  Medical uses  Second generation cephalosporins are more effective in treating Gram-negative bacilli compared to first generation cephalosporins, which have a greater coverage for Gram- positive cocci. Also, it has been reported that cefuroxime is resistant to hydrolysis by Œ≤-lactamases produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Some medical uses are: Upper respiratory tract infections. Lower respiratory tract infections. Urinary tract infections. Skin and soft tissue infections. Gonorrhoea. Early Lyme disease. = Bacterial susceptibility = Cefuroxime axetil treats infections against methicillin, oxacillin and penicillin- sensitive bacterial strains. Cefuroxime axetil does not work against enterococci. Gram-positive aerobic microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-sensitive only) Staphylococcus epidermis Streptococcus pneumoniae (Penicillin-sensitive only) Gram-negative aerobic microorganisms Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae (variable activity)  Mechanism of action  Cefuroxime axetil, as a second generation cephalosporin ;that just as penicillins antibiotics, contains a Œ≤-lactam ring structure. Cephalosporins works as a bactericidal antibiotic; that by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), inhibit the last step of the bacterial cell wall synthesis. Once the Œ≤-lactam ring binds to PBPs, cross-linking between peptidoglycan units is inhibited.  Pharmacokinetics  Absorption: Once consumed, cefuroxime axetil is converted to the active compound cefuroxime by esterases of mucosal cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Cefuroxime is then released for systematic circulation. If cefuroxime axetil is given with food, absorption values can increase by 52% compared to fasting patients. Distribution: It has been reported that after cefuroxime axetil administration, it can be found in tonsil tissue, sinus tissue, bronchial tissue and middle ear effusion. Elimination: After cefuroxime production, the body is unable to metabolize the drug, and is eliminated unchanged in the urine. History It was discovered by Glaxo now GlaxoSmithKline and introduced in 1987. It was approved by FDA on December 28, 1987. It is available by GSK as Ceftin in US and Ceftum in India.

Regional slang from the capital is however heavily exposed and promoted in national media, and considered the de facto Indonesian slang. Despite its direct origins, Indonesian slang often differs quite significantly in both vocabulary and grammatical structure from the most standard form of Indonesia's national language. These expressions are neither standardized nor taught in any formal establishments, but rather function in daily discourse, usually in informal settings. Indonesian speakers regularly mix several regional slangs in their conversations regardless of origin, but depending on the audience and the familiarity level with the listeners. History Its native name, bahasa gaul (the 'social language'), was a term coined in the late 1990s where bahasa means 'language' and gaul means 'social', 'cool' or 'trendy'. Similarly, the term bahasa prok√©m (a more out-dated name for Indonesian slang) created in the early 1970s means 'the language of gangsters'. Prok√©m is a slang form of the word pr√©man and was derived from the Dutch word vrijman (English: freeman; lit. gangster).http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/84123/2/nusa5802.pdf Indonesian slang is predominantly used in everyday conversation, social milieus, among popular media and, to a certain extent, in teen publications or pop culture magazines. For those living in more urbanized regions of Indonesia, Indonesian slang language often functions as the primary language medium for communication in daily life. While it would be unusual to communicate orally with people on a casual basis with very formal Indonesian, the use of proper or 'good and correct' Indonesian (\\"bahasa Indonesia yang baik dan benar\\") is abundant in the media, government bodies, schools, universities, workplaces, amongst some members of the Indonesian upper-class or nobility and also in many other more formal situations. Indonesian slang has evolved rapidly. This is, in part, due to its vocabulary that is often so different from that of standard Indonesian and Malaysian and also because so many new words (both original and foreign) are quite easily incorporated into its increasingly wide vocabulary list. However, as with any language, the constant changing of the times means that some words become rarely used or are rendered obsolete as they are considered to be outdated or no longer follow modern day trends. Classification At present, there is no formal classification for Indonesian slang language as it is essentially a manipulated and popularized form of the Indonesian (the national language of Indonesia). Indonesian is part of the Western Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages. According to the Ethnologue, Indonesian is modelled after Riau Malay, a form of Old Malay originally spoken in Northeast Sumatra. Geographic distribution Indonesian slang language is mostly spoken in urban regions of the Indonesian archipelago. Variations of slang language can be found from city to city, mainly characterised by derivatives of the different local ethnic languages. For example, in Bandung, West Java, the local slang language contains vocabulary from the Sundanese language while the slang found in Jakarta tends to be heavily influenced by English or the old Batavian dialect (i.e. the language of the original inhabitants of Jakarta or Batavia as it was known during the Dutch colonial period). For more information relating to the geographics of Indonesian slang and regional influences, please see \\"Region Specific Slang\\" below. Official status Indonesian slang language is not an official language of Indonesia. However, it is a modified form of the Indonesian language and is widely used for everyday communication and in informal situations. Sometimes it is mixed with formal Indonesian in formal situations, except during state ceremonies, business meetings, and sacred prayers. A number of Indonesians sometimes speak a mixture of Indonesian slang and formal Indonesian in everyday conversation and informal situations. Sounds Indonesian slang generally uses the same pronunciation as standard Indonesian, although there are many influences from regional dialects on certain aspects such as accent and grammatical structure. Loan words adopted from foreign languages (especially European) such as English or Dutch are often transliterated according to the modern Indonesian orthography. For example, 'please' is often written as plis. Another closely related phenomenon to arise in recent years is the formation of complex nouns or phrases created using a combination of English and Indonesian (slang) in the one sentence. A prime example of this is the phrase \\"so what gitu loh!\\", meaning \\"who cares?!\\" or quite simply \\"so what!\\" with added emphasis from the phrase \\"gitu loh\\". \\"Gitu\\" is an abbreviated form of the Indonesian word \\"begitu\\" meaning \\"like that/ such as\\", while \\"loh\\" (also spelt lho) is a particle commonly used in slang or conversational Indonesian to show surprise or instigate a warning. In these cases of combined, interlingual phrases, the original spelling (and quite often the pronunciation) of the foreign word(s) are retained. Hence, the English component of the Indonesian slang phrase \\"so what gitu loh!\\" remains relatively unchanged as far as spelling and pronunciation are concerned. Grammar The overall structure of Indonesian slang is not all that different from formal Indonesian, although in many cases sentences are simplified or shortened when necessary. The differences between formal and colloquial Indonesian are most evident in vocabulary and grammatical structures (e.g. affixes). Vocabulary The structure of the Indonesian slang language is mostly derived from formal Indonesian, however, its vocabulary is a different story altogether. Indonesian slang vocabulary is enriched by a combination of derivatives or loan words/ structures from foreign languages such as Min Nan commonly referred to as Hokkien, English, and Dutch, as well as local ethnic languages such as Batavian, Sundanese, and Javanese. However, in many cases, new words are simply created at random, their origins often quite obscure. ‚Ä¢ A large proportion of the vocabulary used in Indonesian slang language was developed from formal Indonesian through several methods, most of which are listed below: *Nasalisation of active verb, shortening or exclusion of the original prefix and adding -in at the end of the word, for example: **memikirkan (pikir) (\\"to think\\") into mikirin **menanyakan (tanya) (\\"to ask\\") into nanyain (exclusion of me-), often with a glottal stop between the a and the i, thus nanya'in *Adding -in at the end of the passive transitive verbs, for example: **diajari (\\"to be taught\\") into diajarin **dipukuli (\\"to be beaten\\") into dipukulin *Adding ke- at the beginning of passive intransitive verbs, instead of using ter-, and altering pronunciation from a to e (Javanese influence), for example: **tertangkap (\\"to be caught\\") into ketangkep **terpel√®s√®t (\\"to accidentally slip\\") into kepel√®s√®t *Eliminating one or few letters of the word, for example: **habis (\\"depleted/finished/emptied\\") into abis **tahu (\\"know\\") into tau **sudah (\\"already\\") into udah/ud√®h *Contraction of two or more words into one word, for example: **terima kasih (\\"thank\\") into makasih **jaga image (\\"to safeguard one's social image\\") into ja'im, with a glottal stop between the a and the i **percaya diri (\\"confidence\\") into PD or p√©d√© **tidak jelas (\\"not clear\\") into gaj√© or gaj√©bo (gak jelas bo') **malas bergerak (\\"lazy to move\\") into mager *Replacing a with e in some words (Javanese influence), for example: **benar (\\"correct\\") into bener **pintar (\\"smart\\") into pinter **malas (\\"lazy\\") into males **segar (\\"fresh\\") into seger *Contracting a diphthong into a monophthong (monophthongization), for example: **kalau (\\"if\\") into kalo **pakai (\\"use\\") into pak√® **sampai (\\"until\\") into samp√® *Addition/ exclusion of silent consonants and glottal stops to the beginning/ends of words: **pakai (\\"use\\") into pak√® or even pak√®k (final -k being a glottal stop) **enggak (\\"no, not\\") into nggak or ngga or even gak/ga/kaga/ogah/wegah (enggak itself is also a slang word.) *Contracting the beginning three letters with the infix -ok- after the first letter (ended with closest consonant if the third letter is a vowel), for example: **bapak/ayah (\\"father\\") into bokap **ibu (\\"mother\\") into nyokap from 'enyak' **jual (\\"sell\\") into jokul **b√©rak (\\"defecate\\") into bok√®r **Bapak dan Ibu (\\"Father and Mother\\") into bonyok *Add the prefix nge- (before a consonant, except k) or ng- (before a vowel or k) to signify activity, for example: **ngebut (\\"to go fast\\") **ngedance (\\"dance\\") **ngedrink (\\"drink\\") **ngedrug (\\"do drugs\\") **ngegebet (\\"to pick up\\") **ngafe (\\"go to a caf√©\\") **ngabur or ngacir (\\"fleeing\\") **ngimpi (\\"dreaming\\") **ngomong (\\"speaking\\") **ngiler (\\"drooling\\") **ngentot (\\"having sex\\") ‚Ä¢ Some words are simply transliterated from English, for example: *Sorry into sori *Friend into pr√®n *Swear into su√®r *Brother into bro *Sister into sis *by the way into btw (b√©t√©w√©) ‚Ä¢ Some words are also adopted or transliterated from Chinese languages (mainly Hokkien and Mandarin), for example: *Angpau / Angpao - means literally 'red packet'. It is used to describe the monetary gift given during holidays or special occasions, such as the Chinese New Year or weddings or birthdays. It is a practice done by Chinese community throughout the world, the banknote/paper money is placed inside a red envelope before it is given out. It can also be used to define bonus payment. *Au Ban / Auban (stubborn) *Bo (no, don't have) - it is often used with another descriptive noun/adjective, for example: **Bo Huat - means literally \\"no ability\\" or can be translated to \\"no way, no method\\" or 'I can't' (from English internet slang). It is to express a situation/feeling when you are giving up on something/someone because you can no longer find any way/idea/method/approach to solve something. **Bo Kam Guan (\\"not sincerely willing to let go of something\\") *Ceng Li / Cengli (\\"fair, make sense\\") *Cuan (earn, profit) *H«éo Chƒ´ into Hau Ce / Hauce (delicious, tasty) - adopted from Mandarin Chinese word (Â•ΩÂêÉ) *H«éo Chƒ´ Sh√©n Jƒ´ng B√¨ng into Hau Ce Sen Cin Ping / Hauce Sen Cin Ping (extremely/overly delicious) - Â•ΩÂêÉÁ•ûÁ∂ìÁóÖ (in Traditional Chinese characters) or Â•ΩÂêÉÁ•ûÁªèÁóÖ (in Simplified Chinese characters) - Sh√©n Jƒ´ng B√¨ng (Á•ûÁ∂ìÁóÖ or Á•ûÁªèÁóÖ) literally means 'crazy or insane'. It is derived from Indonesian popular slang expression enak gila (from enak \\"delicious, tasty\\" and gila \\"crazy, insane\\"), translated to Mandarin Chinese version of it yet it is written in Indonesian spelling. Similar to \\"Shiok\\" of Singlish. *Ho Ciak (\\"delicious\\" or \\"tasty\\") - adopted from Hokkien language. Hokkien version of \\"H«éo Chƒ´\\" (Â•ΩÂêÉ). *Kepo (\\"busybody, nosy person; really curious\\") - adopted from Hokkien language. It defines a condition when a person wants to know about everything, sometimes to the point that he/she is interfering other people's affairs. It is also used in Singlish as kaypoh and Taiwanese Hokkien. *Toke / Tauke (\\"boss\\") ‚Ä¢ Some words originated from the LGBT community (especially among transvestites) usually adding the nasal-sounded suffix -ong in the end of the base word. This was also an attempt among LGBT community to alter the words to become more \\"French-sounding\\", thus sounding more sexy, for example: *Dendong from dandan (\\"to dress up\\" and/or \\"apply make-up\\") *Gedong (\\"big, extra large, monstrous\\") from Javanese gedhe (\\"big\\"). But sometimes also means ged (from gede) + dong (from dongo \\"stupid; silly\\"), thus meaning \\" a person who's only big in posture, but have a small brain (stupid)\\" *Gretong from gratis (\\"free\\") *Hemong (\\"homosexual\\") from homo *Klewong (\\"to ejaculate/cum\\") from keluar (\\"out; eject\\") *Lekong (\\"man, men, male\\") from laki-laki (\\"men\\") *Meong (could means either \\"want\\" or \\"sexual activity\\") - derived from mau (\\"want\\") and also the sound of the cat, refer to the moaning sounds during sexual activity. *Sekong (homosexual) from sakit (\\"sick\\") *Sepong - (\\"fellatio\\" or \\"blow job\\") from isep which means \\"to suck\\". *Tempong or tembong - (\\"anal intercourse\\") from tembak (\\"shoot\\") and bokong (\\"ass\\" or \\"butt\\"). ‚Ä¢ Many words also emerged without following the above rules at all, many of which have their own unique history and/or origin. For example: *ABG / Ab√©g√© (\\"teenagers\\") - Stands for anak baru gede, which literally means \\"a child who has just grown up\\". The original Indonesian term is remaja \\"teen\\". *Alay literally means \\"low-class boys/ kids\\". It comes from the words anak layangan, which means children who hunt the cut-off kites on the streets because they can not afford to buy themselves the kite (layangan). It is often to associate street children with their typical characteristics: smelly, dirty, rarely bathing or brown/ yellowish hair colour mostly caused by spending too much time on the street during the day.

The word bokep obtained by inserting infix -ok- in between 'Be- Ep'. *Bo'ol - (\\"anus\\") - it literally means \\"anus\\" or \\"rectum\\". Thus the term dibo'olin (passive) means being the receptive partner in anal intercourse, while ngebo'olin (active) means being the penetrative partner. These terms are popular among the LGBT community and anybody who practices anal intercourse. *Cabe-cabean - (\\"slutty cheap girl\\"), cabe means \\"chilli pepper\\", but this cabe came from the abbreviation of cewek alay bisa diewe, which means 'low'class/lame girl that can be fucked'.

Culun itself is slang with the same meaning as cupu. Punya means \\"have / possess / belonging\\". It became popular when Pop Ice showed their advertisement on TV in 2007 *Do'i (\\"boyfriend / girlfriend\\") - Originated from the word dia (\\"him/her\\") transformed by inserting letter o in the middle and deleting the last letter a. It is later transformed into doski.

It is widely used by Indonesian teenagers today. It is usually used to express the state of feeling brokenhearted or when they're feeling uncertain and down. *Gebetan (\\"crush\\") *GR from gede rasa - means literally \\"having a big feeling\\". This phrase is used to show that someone has felt something that actually still unclear whether it can come true or not. *Ja'im from jaga imej - literally means \\"keeping (a good) image\\" *Jayus/Garing \\"lame, corny\\"; meant to sound funny, but it is not.

This term hugely popularized by a Ratu music video. It sometimes also associated as casual sex partner or friends with benefits. *Telmi from 'telat mikir' (Dutch te laat \\"too late\\", Indonesian mikir < pikir \\"to think\\") - describes someone who is a little bit slow on the uptake. *T-O-P B-G-T or top banget means really cool or awesome *Woles - relax or take your time, from inverted english word of 'Slow'. Particles Many slang particles are used in the end of a sentence. Usually, these particles do not directly change the sentence's meaning, in the sense that the truth conditions remain the same. However, they can have other effects, such as emphasizing a sentence, or suggesting hesitancy. They can be used to reinforce the social link between speaker and listener. For example, the sentence Dia datang (she/he comes) could be modified by one of the following particles: * Dia datang nih - used as exclamation. * Dia datang dong - expresses certainty (She comes for sure), or sometimes obviousness (usually cheekily); dong can be stressed with a long vowel to mean She has to come. * Dia datang kok - used to convince someone who might doubt the sentence. * Dia datang lah - expresses a high level of certainty. * Dia datang lho - could be translated as She comes, you know. * Dia datang ah - expresses hesitancy; could be translated as I think she/he comes. * Dia datang dooong - expresses hesitancy; could be translated as I wish she'd come or Please let her come * Dia datang deng - used to correct what was wrong; could be translated as She came apparently * Dia datang deh - used to emphasize that 'finally' the person is coming, or in different intonation and context, it is used to emphasize a condition for proposing a request, for instance in a context of: 'She will come too, so please also come with us' Particles can also be used to introduce questions. The following examples could both be translated as How could she come?: * Kok, Dia datang? - used when the speaker finds the sentence difficult to believe. * Lho? Dia datang - indicates surprise or disbelief. Vocabulary evolution =Pre-1980s= *Kumpul kebo - Lit. means 'water buffalo-style gathering' or 'gather like cattle'. It originated during the Dutch colonial era and was known as koempoel gebouw. Gebouw refers to a building and thus the phrase means to live together under the same roof (as an umarried couple). Confusion has caused this term to be linked with kerbau (buffalo). The slang term for kerbau is 'kebo'. This term basically means that two people in a relationship are living together without being married, i.e. in a domestic partnership/ de facto relationship. To Kumpul kebo in Indonesia is considered immoral and sometimes illicit. For these reasons and also those relating to religion, Asian culture, and general ethics, it is often frowned upon in modern Indonesian society to do such a thing. =1980s= The 1980s was the era of bahasa prok√©m. At this time slang language vocabulary was formed by inserting the infix -ok- after the first consonant of a word, and deleting the last syllable, creating a totally new word. \\"Prokem\\" itself is a prokem word, created by adding -ok- to preman and removing the -an. For example, the word Bapak was broken into B-ok-apak and the last -ak is deleted, and the resulting word is Bokap which, until this day, is used as a slang term for Father. The word Sekolah (School) was transformed into Skokul, but this word slowly become outdated and by the 1990s the word was no longer used, and changed to Sekul or simply Skul, reminiscent of the English word \\"school\\". Other notable words such as m√©mbl√© (ugly, frowning), k√©c√©, (beautiful, good looking) from the words \\"keren cekali\\" (very cool), the sentence attribute Nih y√©, and the exclamation Alamakjan! all emerged in the same decade. =New Millennium= Much of the slang language created post-2000 originated from the Indonesian LGBT community. The latest method for transforming a word is to take a different word which has a similar sound. For example, the word mau (want), is replaced with the word mawar originally meaning rose. Despite its creativity and originality, this latest form of Indonesian slang can be quite complicated to understand, even to the native Indonesians themselves. For example: Akika tinta mawar macarena originates from the sentence written in proper Indonesian - Aku tidak mau makan meaning 'I don't want to eat'. The abbreviations often used to mask insult, such as kamseupay (totally lame) abbreviation of kampungan sekali udik payah (really provincial, rurally lame). Region specific slang =Jakarta slang= Jakarta including Botabek is the capital city of Indonesia with a population of more than 20 million people. Consequently, such a huge population will undoubtedly have a role in the Jakarta slang evolution. Much of the slang evolved from the Betawi dialect. Some prominent examples: *Aj√© (from 'saja') - Only, just, from the Betawi dialect *Ay√© - I, me *Bacot - Talk too much. *Bang (from 'abang') - Slang form of address for elder males/ brother. *Banget - Very, from the Betawi dialect *B√©go (from 'bodoh') - Stupid, from the Betawi dialect *Berapa duit? or Berapaan? - How much money/ how much is the cost? *Bo'il (with a glottal stop between o and i) - Car *Bokap - Father *Nyokap - Mother *Bonyok - Mother and Father combined, also a slang which means a bruise. * Cab√© - chili pepper (cabai) * Capek - Tired (lelah) * Kebon - Garden (kebun) *Nyolot - Haughty, arrogant. *Doang (from 'saja')- which means only, that's all *√âmangnya kenapa? - So what? / What does it matter? *Gil√©! (from 'gila')- An exclamation meaning crazy/insane/obscene, as emphasis to a sentence or phrase. *Gua/Gu√© - I, Me, from the Betawi dialect *Jayus (from jail, usil') - Ignorant and nosy. *Manyun - Someone with protruding lips, usually used to describe when someone is upset. *M√©cing - From English word matching which means fitting. *Bus√©t - A form of expression which is similar to \\"Oh My God\\" or \\"Alas\\" or \\"Holy shit!\\" *Lu/Lo - You, from the Betawi dialect * Pengen - Want (ingin) * Kondangan - Invitation (undangan), usually a wedding invitation *Gan/Agan - Boss, from Sundanese \\"juragan\\" *Gendut or Gembrot - Fat *Gombal - Crazy or, as another term, flirtatious words *Sinting - Insane, a freak person. *Yo'i - Yes, very cool. *Guga - Juga, (also) *Ngenlay - Kangen, although \\"kangen\\" is slang for rindu. The following words are taken from Hokkien (Fukkien) Chinese, and commonly used in transactions. *Gocap - IDR 50 *Cepek - IDR 100 *Gopek - IDR 500 *Seceng - IDR 1000 *Cenggo - IDR 1500 *Goceng - IDR 5000 *Ceban - IDR 10.000 *Goban - IDR 50.000 However, many Indonesians of non-Chinese descent do not know the meaning of the transaction words above, probably with the exception of Goceng due to its usage on KFC Indonesia's advertising on their \\"Goceng\\" products, in which all \\"Goceng\\" menus are sold at the IDR 5000 price range. Sometimes the word \\"perak\\", literally \\"silver\\", is used to describe small denominations of currency. =Bandung slang= Bandung is the capital city of West Java province with a predominantly Sundanese culture. The Sundanese language has three levels or forms, namely: high (polite), middle class, and low (impolite). Bandung slang often uses the Low Sundanese pronouns along with the many other Sundanese translations of popular Indonesian. Some examples: *Aing (from kuring) - I/me *Sia - you *Euy - Sundanese particle in the end of the sentence to express excitement and surprise *Da - Sundanese particle in the end of the sentence to express certainty and emphasizes the meaning, somehow similar to Japanese \\"desu\\". *O'on (from Blo'on) or Oneng (from the name of a slow witted character in Sinetron Bajaj Bajuri) - stupid, dim witted *Maneh - you *Belegug - stupid =Bogor slang= Bogor is a city in the province of West Java with the former Kingdom of Sunda Padjajaran, Bogor slang is Sundanese with its influence from Indonesian language and sometimes uses Sundanese with the word pronounced backwards. =Sukabumi slang= Sukabumi slang the language is a non-standard variety of Sundanese language that is often used in Sukabumi, West Java in the Tipar area, because Widal itself means Tipar. This Sani or Widal language can also be called slang or slang in the Sundanese dialect, where the pronunciation of the letters in the consonants changes. For example, the letter G becomes S, J becomes C, and 'ng' becomes 'ny' and so on. =Javanese slang= These slangs are shared across Central Java and Yogyakarta where Javanese is predominantly spoken. Like Sundanese which are spoken in Bandung, Javanese also has 3 different set of vocabularies, based on the politeness level. Common people usually talk with a mix between low-Javanese, middle-Javanese, and Indonesian. Some non-Javanese residents added their own dialects to the pot, resulting what is called the Central Java slang Jogjakarta Jogjakarta slang is also known as Basa Walikan, literally means 'Reverse Language' . It is a transformation of Javanese, in which Javanese consonants are switched with one another, as shown below: *ha na ca ra ka ‚Üî pa dha ja ya nya *da ta sa wa la ‚Üî ma ga ba tha nga With the above rules, the expletive expression Matamu! (which literally means: 'Your Eyes!') becomes Dagadu!. The following website automatically performs this transformation: Walikan Translator Malang Malang slang is inverted alphabetical word (mostly from Javanese and little bit from Indonesian). The way is just read from end of the word. Example: Ongis Nade comes from Singo Edan (the nickname of Arema Cronus F.C.), \\"Helum\\" comes from \\"Muleh\\" (Go home in Javanese), and some name of place like \\"Sawojajar\\" become \\"Rajajowas\\". Surabaya As the second largest city in Indonesia and the capital of East Java, Surabaya uses a rougher dialect of Javanese and has a fairly complete list of its own slang. Javanese language originated from the Central Javanese farmland and by the time it reached the coastal area of East Java, it changed from its original polite form into a more impolite version with the creation or further adaptation of many new 'Javanese-style' words and swearwords. =Medan slang= Medan is the capital of North Sumatra Province. Most of the slang from Medan are heavily influenced by Malay, Hokkien and Karo language. For example, \\"bapa\\" for \\"father\\", \\"nande\\" for \\"mother\\", \\"ked√©\\" for \\"shop\\", \\"tutup lampu\\" for \\"turn off the light\\", \\"buka radio\\" for \\"turn on the radio\\". Another example of Medan slang is by adding \\"punya\\" at the end of the sentence. For example, \\"mobil aku punya\\" for \\"my car\\". They also have the tendency to confuse between e and √©. =Jambi & Palembang slang= Jambi and Palembang slang mostly involves changing the letter at the end of the word with letter 'o'. However, not all words can be modified to include the characteristic 'o', as this rule applies mostly to words ending with the letter 'a'. Sometimes Palembang use shorter-version of word by erase first syllables, like 'segala' in standard Malay-Indonesian to 'galo'. *Kito - kita (we) *Galo - segala (all, every) *Ngapo - kenapa (why or what happened) *Jugo - Juga (too) Another characteristic pattern of Jambi and Palembang slang involves the addition or replacement of the final letter of a word with 'k'. *Pulak - pula (too, also, as well) *Aek - air (water) Another classic Malay Sumatran dialect also prevailed in most of Sumatran cities, from Palembang to Bengkulu, Jambi and Pekanbaru. These classical Malay words such as nian is used in Sumatran cities instead of sangat or banget (very). *Nian - nian (classical Malay) - sangat (standard Indonesian) - banget (Indonesian slang) =Pontianak slang= Pontianak slang is influenced by Malay, Teochew and Dayak and sometimes combined with Hakka. It is spoken in the Malay dialect. These slang varieties are spoken throughout West Kalimantan. =Makassarese slang= Makassarese slang is highly influenced by the native Makassarese dialect and sometimes combined with Chinese accents. The slang, in the end, sounds more informal and 'rude', as going with the tough image of Makassarese people. The possessive word for you (kamu) has three degrees of politeness: -ta (very formal and respectful), -mu (neutral), and -nu (informal). For example: *This book belongs to you ‚Üí Buku ini punya-ta (the - reads as a glottal stop, which makes it punya'ta. In Makassarese dialect, the apostrophe is sometimes added in written form). Buku ini punya'mu is deemed more neutral, while Buku ini punya'nu is only spoken with very close friends. Meanwhile, the word for you itself is divided into two, the formal ki and the informal ko. *'Di mana maki (Where are you now) as opposed to informal 'Di mana moko. The -ma and -mo derives from the -mi which is often added in the end of words, having various meanings. It is hard to determine when to use mi or not, except to learn it by heart. Ini mi? -> 'This one?' Biarkan mi -> 'Let it go' Ko sudah belajar mi? -> 'Have you studied?'. Ko derives from the informal Indonesian word Kau, which stands for 'you'. Sudah dimulaimi itu ulangan? -> 'Has the exam started?', literally, 'Has-been started-the exam?' Ji is also often used in the end of words. Most often, it means 'only', or used to give a more assuring tone to a sentence. * Sedikit ji -> 'It's only a little' * Tidak apa-apa ji -> 'It's okay' * Tidak susah ji soalnya -> 'The problem isn't difficult.' Di functions more like a question tag, read with a glottal stop at the end, which makes it to be 'dik' *Tidak susah ji di?? -> It's not difficult, right? Aside from that, Makassarese more often speak with a heavier accent, mixing many of the Indonesian words with native Makassar words. *Tena ku isseng'i apa maksudnya (or even more complicated Tena ku isseng'i apa massu'na ) -> Literally, \\"No I understand what its meaning\\", actually meaning, \\"I don't understand what it means\\". In places, Makassarese slangs add -i at the end of words, putting a glottal stop before that. Furthermore, the words tend to be shortened considerably, which makes -nya read as -na and words ending with -d or -t gets its ending replaced with glottal stops. Menyusut (shrinking) becomes menyusuk, and vice versa. Native Makassar people usually reads becak (pedicab) as becat.

Killed that year, he is now considered a national hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and also of Belize and Costa Rica. Vincentian politician Camillo Gonsalves described him in 2011 as his country's \\"sole national hero\\".Review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Universal Periodic Review, United Nations Human Rights Council, 10 May 2011 History In 1772, the population rebelled. Led by Chatoyer, the First Carib War forced the British to sign a treaty with them in 1773. This was the first time Britain had been forced to sign an accord with non-white people in the Caribbean. By 1795, it became apparent to the local population that Britain had no intention of obeying the treaty. The people of the Caribbean then rose in rebellion and were joined by a group of French radicals, inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution, who saw Britain as a traditional enemy of France. In the Second Carib War, Chatoyer divided the island with his brother Duvalle, who was another chieftain. Duvalle had a Guadeloupean lieutenant by the name of Massoteau. Working his way along the coast, Chatoyer was met by his French supporters at Chateaubelair, and together the forces worked their way to Dorsetshire Hill, from where they would launch their attack on the capital city, Kingstown. On March 14, a battalion of British soldiers led by General Ralph Abercromby, marched toward Dorsetshire Hill. That night, Chatoyer was killed by Major Alexander Leith. Though the rebellion continued until October 1796 under the leadership of Duvalle, Chatoyer's death led to the desertion of the French supporters and without their aid, the tide of the war turned in favour of the British. As a national hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Chatoyer is recognized with a monument on Dorsetshire Hill, where he died. Legacy Although Chatoyer died before the remainder of the rebels were deported to Roatan in Honduras, from where they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America and became known as the Garifuna people; he is considered to have been a Garifuna warrior.Colon Jr, Teofilo, \\"Memorial Mass for GARIFUNA Warrior, Paramount Chief JOSEPH CHATOYER To Take Place In The Bronx on SUNDAY, March 15th 2015 as Part of 2015 GARIFUNA American Heritage Month in New York\\", Beinggarifuna.com, 14 March 2015. A play based on his life, The Drama of King Shotaway, was written by William Henry Brown, an African American from the West Indies, and Director of the African Theatre. It was the first play written in the United States by a black man. The play was produced by the African Company at the African Grove Theatre in New York City in 1823, but no manuscript survived.Peterson, Bernard, Early Black American Playwrights and Dramatic Writers: A Biographical Directory and Catalog of Plays, Films, and Broadcasting Scripts, Greenwood Publishing, 1990, pp. 37‚Äì39.

It is a member of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). Florida uses NFHS contest rules in its sports. History The Florida High School Athletic Association was founded on April 9, 1920 by a group of 29 high school principals which met on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville. The organization was founded as the Florida High School Athletic Association. The name was changed to Florida High School Activities Association in 1951. The name was changed back to Florida High School Athletic Association in 2002. The 29 schools who became charter members were: Summerlin (Bartow), Clearwater, Mainland (Daytona Beach), Seabreeze (Daytona Beach), DeLand, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Gainesville, Duval (Jacksonville), Osceola (Kissimmee), Columbia (Lake City), Lakeland, Leesburg, Suwannee (Live Oak), Miami, Ocala, Orlando, Putnam (Palatka), Pensacola, Plant City, Quincy, Seminole (Sanford), Ketterlinus (St. Augustine), St. Petersburg, Leon (Tallahassee), Hillsborough (Tampa), Hardee (Wauchula), West Palm Beach, and Winter Haven. The first Constitution limited membership to public schools. However, in 1930, it was amended to open membership to private and parochial schools as well. In 1951, the member schools voted to change the word \\"athletic\\" to \\"activities\\" in the organization name so that non-athletic activities such as music and student council programs would also receive proper supervision at the state level. The Association was incorporated in 1962. While the association's charter had never specifically excluded non- white student participation, none actually participated until 1967, when all- black Gibbs High School not only participated in basketball but won the state championship. In 1968 the FIAA disbanded. The FHSAA has never comprehensively incorporated the achievements of the black high schools into their record books. In 1996 the FHSAA adopted regulations permitting students enrolled in home education programs to participate in interscholastic activities. The regulations would later allow future Heisman Trophy quarterback Tim Tebow to participate in high-school football; similar rules adopted later by other states would thus be called the \\"Tebow rule\\". In May 1997, the Florida Legislature recognized in statute the FHSAA as the governing body for interscholastic athletics in Florida, provided the Association comply with the provisions of a legislatively mandated revamping of its governmental structure. The name was changed back to Florida High School Athletic Association in 2002. As of August 2007, the FHSAA has a membership of 748 schools. In 2017, the association adopted a points method of ranking football teams for state championship playoffs. Points are awarded on the basis of wins, and losses, opponents records, and past playoff records. Sports programs The FHSAA oversees the following sports: =Sanctioned sports= * Baseball * Basketball * Cross Country * Football (Boys) * Golf * Soccer * Softball * Swimming & Diving * Tennis * Track & Field * Adapted Track & Field * Volleyball (Girls) * Weightlifting (Boys) * Wrestling =Recognized sports= * Bowling * Competitive Cheerleading * Flag Football (Girls) * Lacrosse * Volleyball (Boys) * Water Polo * Weightlifting (Girls) Competitive classifications As in most areas, high schools compete in sports in two types of division. One, because of logistical and geographical constraints, is necessarily local: large schools play small ones in the same area. There are four geographical regions for most sports, each subdivided into up to 16 districts, typically four for larger school classifications and two for smaller school classifications, to reduce travel time and expense for conference play. Another level of classification is made based on school population and is statewide. Eventually, schools with the best records in this type of classification will meet each other for seasonal playoffs to determine the state champion. That classification is calculated every two years for each sport and provides schools the opportunity to appeal their classification based on certain factors, primarily transportation expense. There are as many as eight classes, from 1A to 8A, based on population, the largest schools compete in 8A. For 2019-20, the schools were classified based upon the total number of high school students, as follows: Bracket 1A is specifically identified as \\"Rural\\". Previously in 2017-8, the brackets were: Class 1A-4A are no longer broken down into districts. Their \\"districts\\" are listed as \\"Independent\\". These teams are eligible to compete within the FHSAA State Series. FHSAA's All-Century Football Team FHSAA's All-Century Team was selected in December 2007, to celebrate 100 years of high school football in Florida. It was selected by a panel of Florida high school experts. The Florida High School Athletic Association lists the 34 greatest high school football players in state history. In conjunction with selecting the All- Century team, the FHSAA named an All-Century Coaching Staff.

The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept and usually displayed, to represent the success of the hunt. The game sought is typically a large or impressively ornamented male, such as one having large horns or antlers. Generally, only parts of the animal are kept as trophies (usually the head, skin, horns, or antlers) and the carcass itself is used for food. Trophies are often displayed in the hunter's home or office, and often in specially designed \\"trophy rooms\\", sometimes called \\"game rooms\\" or \\"gun rooms\\", in which the hunter's weaponry is displayed as well.Business Week On the hunt for a gun room?: Business celebrates a love of firearms, hunting big animals, Knight Ridder, 10/11/2009 (retrieved 10/11/2009) Trophy hunting has both firm supporters and strong opponents. Debates surrounding trophy hunting centrally concern not only the question of the morality of recreational hunting and supposed conservation efforts of big-game and ranch hunting, but also the observed decline in animal species that are targets for trophy hunting.  Types of trophy hunting  = African trophy hunting = British Governor Sir Henry Hesketh Bell with hunting trophies in Uganda, 1908 Trophy hunting has been practiced in Africa and is still practiced in many African countries. According to a study sponsored by International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the revenue generated by hunting tourism in seven Southern African Development Communities (SADC) in 2008 was approximately US$190 million.http://www.cic-wildlife.org/fileadmin/Press/Technical_Series/EN/8_.pdf The practice of trophy hunting supersedes that of ranch or farm hunting, but game ranches helped to legitimize trophy hunting as a facet of the tourism industry in Africa. The first game ranches in Africa were established in the 1960s, and the concept quickly grew in proliferation. Statistics from 2000 illustrate that there were approximately 7000 game farms and reservations operating within South Africa, established on about 16 million hectares of land in the country. Game ranches attract wealthy tourists interested in hunting, as well as foreign investors on a large scale. Huntress in Namibia with an eland antelope Economists at Large Report demonstrated how little money actually reaches communities. Jeff Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, states that \\"despite the wild claims that trophy hunting brings millions of dollars in revenue to local people in otherwise poor communities, there is no proof of this. The money that does come into Africa from hunting pales in comparison to the billions generated from tourists who come just to watch wildlife. If lions and other animals continue to disappear from Africa, this vital source of income‚Äînonconsumptive tourism‚Äîwill end, adversely impacting people all over Africa\\". However, South African Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, contradicts Flocken's conclusions by stating that the hunting industry has contributed millions to South Africa's economy in past years. In the 2010 hunting season, total revenue of approximately R1.1 billion was generated by the local and trophy hunting industries collectively. \\"This amount only reflects the revenue generated through accommodation and species fees. The true revenue is therefore substantially higher, as this amount does not even include revenue generated through the associated industries as a result of the multiplier effect\\", according to Molewa. South Africa's canned lion industry however runs the risk of damaging 'Brand South Africa' and it's profitable nature tourism industry. = North American trophy hunting = Hunter with a bear's head and hide strapped to his back on the Kodiak Archipelago After the public outcry from the Killing of Cecil the lion, awareness of this sport was raised worldwide. Attention also focussed on North American sport hunting, in particular the cougar. The cougar, also called the mountain lion, puma, or panther, is hunted for sport across its expansive habitat. According to the Washington, the only federally protected populations in the country are the Florida panther and the Eastern cougar, believed to be extinct. Several states‚Äîincluding Colorado, Utah and Washington‚Äîin recent years have proposed an increase in cougar hunting for various reasons, California is currently the only state throughout the West that prohibits cougar hunting.SABALOW, RYAN AND PHILLIP REESE. \\"WHY WE STILL KILL COUGARS: California voters banned mountain lion hunting three decades ago, but the shooting never stopped\\", The Sacramento Bee (November 3, 2017). The Boone and Crockett Club, claim they used the selective harvest of older males to aid in the recovery of many big game species which were on the brink of extinction at the turn of the 20th century. The organization continues to promote this practice today, and monitors conservation success through its Big Game Records data set. North American trophy hunting should not be confused with canned hunting or \\"vanity hunting\\", which involves the shooting of genetically manipulated and selectively bred animals for the sole purpose of collecting an animal for display. The Boone and Crockett Club disavows this practice and actively campaigns against it. = Ranch hunting = Ranch hunting is a form of big-game hunting where the animals hunted are specifically bred on a ranch for trophy hunting purposes. Many species of game such as the Indian blackbuck, nilgai, axis deer, barasingha, the Iranian red sheep, and variety of other species of deer, sheep, and antelope, as well as tigers and lions and hybrids of these from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands were introduced to ranches in Texas and Florida for the sake of trophy hunting. These animals are typically hunted on a fee for each kill, with hunters paying $4,000 or more to be able to hunt exotic game. As many of these species are endangered or threatened in their native habitat, the United States' government requires 10% of the hunting fee to be given to conservation efforts in the areas where these animals are indigenous. Hunting of endangered animals in the United States is normally illegal under the Endangered Species Act, but is permitted on these ranches since the rare animals hunted there are not indigenous to the United States. The Humane Society of the United States has criticized these ranches and their hunters with the reasoning that they are still hunting endangered animals even if the animals were raised specifically to be hunted.  Game auctions  Game auctions help provide game farms and reserves with their wildlife. These facilities are important in terms of tourism in Africa, one of the continent's largest economic sectors, accounting for almost 5% of South Africa's GDP, for example. South Africa in particular is the main tourist destination on the continent, and as a result, hosts a large number of game auctions, farms, and reservations. Game auctions serve as competitive markets that allow farm and reservation owners to bid on and purchase animals for their facilities. Animals purchased at auctions for these purposes are commonly bought directly as game, or are then bred to supply facilities. Animals used for breeding are generally females, which cost more on average than males due to the increased breeding prospects they present. In addition to sex, other factors that contribute to the prices of animals on auction include the demand for particular species (based on their overall rarity) and the costs of maintaining them. Animals that receive increased interest from poachers, such as rhinos or elephants due to their ivory horns and tusks, present additional risks to game farm operations, and do not typically sell well at auction. However other herbivores, specifically ungulate species, tend to fetch exponentially higher sums than carnivores. Prices for these animals can reach into the hundreds of thousands in South African rands, equivalent to tens of thousands of American dollars.  Legal standing  17th Duke of Medinaceli with a trophy polar bear killed by him in an expedition with the 18th Duke of Pe√±aranda to the Arctic Circle, 1910 Trophy hunting is legal in many countries ; however, there are restrictions on the species that can be hunted, when hunting can take place, and the weapons that can be used. Permits and government consent are also required. Specific laws of trophy hunting vary based on the criteria mentioned, and some areas have even banned trophy hunting all together. Costa Rica, Kenya and Malawi, are amongst the countries which have chosen to ban trophy hunting. In 1973, the United States passed a law called the Endangered Species Act. This was meant to stop hunting and trafficking of many endangered species in the U.S. that are looked at as prized by many hunters such as the Wood Bison and Polar Bear.  Influence in conservation  = In Africa = Trophy hunting was introduced by the British Colonials in an era of plentiful wildlife. It has never been a part of African culture. The Maasai tribes of Kenya and Tanzania have turned their backs on the rite of passage of lion killing and now conserve lions, mindful of the reduced numbers of lions, they decided to reduce the size of their cattle herds. Some argue it can provide economic incentives to conserve areas for wildlife 'if it pays it stays' and there are some research studies in Conservation Biology, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, Wildlife Conservation by Sustainable Use, and Animal Conservation. There are concerns that the same species targeted by trophy hunters are key individuals to their herds. It is now estimated only around 40 great tuskers, elephants with tusks to the ground are left. Mature elephant bulls are now known to be the favoured bulls for breeding females, and to have a stabilising effect on younger males. The trophy hunters favoured lion target is a mature male lion with an impressive mane, these males are 'pride' lions, their loss could equate to as many as 20 lions, as a new pride male will kill cubs when he takes over the pride which has lost it's dominant male lion. Tanzania has an estimated 40 percent of the population of lions. Its wildlife authorities defend their success in keeping such numbers (as compared to countries like Kenya, where lion numbers have plummeted dramatically) as linked to the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool. According to Alexander N. Songorwa, director of wildlife for the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, trophy hunting generated roughly $75 million for Tanzania's economy from 2008 to 2011.  Effects of trophy hunting on animal populations  When poorly managed, trophy hunting can cause negative ecological impacts for the target species such as altered age/sex structures, social disruption, deleterious genetic effects, and even population declines in the event of excessive off-takes, as well as threaten the conservation and influence the behavior of non-target species. The conservation role of the industry is also hindered by governments and hunting operators that fail to devolve adequate benefits to local communities, reducing incentives for them to protect wildlife,Booth VR. (2010). Contribution of Hunting Tourism: How Significant Is This to National Economies. Joint publication of FAO and CIC.Campbell R. (2013). The $200 million question. How much does trophy hunting really contribute to African communities? A report for the African Lion Coalition. Economists at large, Melbourne, Australia. and by unethical activities, such as shooting from vehicles and canned hunting, conducted by some attract negative press. While locals may hunt certain species as pests, particularly carnivorous species such as leopards, these animals, as well as lions and cougars, are known to exhibit infanticidal tendencies which can be exacerbated by the removal of adult males from their populations. Males are trophy hunted more frequently than females. However, the removal of these males still degrades the networks and groups these species create in order to survive and provide for offspring. Hunting regulations and laws proposing constant proportions or thresholds of community members for these species have been proposed in African nations such as Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, but are exceptionally difficult to enforce due to the logistics of tracking carnivore populations. According to the Smithsonian Institution and the World Wildlife Fund, wildlife populations have decreased by an alarming rate of 52% since 1970. This is heavily concentrated on mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The decline is attributed to several reasons including over-exploitation, habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Lion Population (Y axis) Year (X axis) The graph depicts lion population decline from the 1800s. This information was taken from the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative.  Effects on habitat loss  Surveyed Views of Trophy Hunters Lindsey et al. (2006) A 2005 paper by Nigel Leader-Williams and colleagues in the Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy asserted that the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, white rhinos increased from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000.http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled- conservation/ Leader-Williams's study also showed that trophy hunting in Zimbabwe doubled wildlife areas relative to state protected areas. The implementation of controlled and legalized hunting led to an increase in the area of suitable land available to elephants and other wildlife, which \\"reversed the problem of habitat loss and helping to maintain a sustained population increase in Zimbabwe's already large elephant population\\". A scientific study in the journal, Biological Conservation by Diogo Andrade, states that trophy hunting is of \\"major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas, including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism\\". Financial incentives from trophy hunting effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation, relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone, according to the study published in Biological Conservation. According to the American writer and journalist Richard Conniff, if Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased from 1,000 in 1982 to 27,000 in 2014. Elephants, which are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory, have gone from 15,000 to 20,000 in 1995. Lions, which were on the brink of extinction \\"from Senegal to Kenya\\", are increasing in Namibia.  Financial support of conservation efforts  The International Union for Conservation of Nature recognizes that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species and their habitats outside of protected areas.IUCN Species Survival Commission (2012). Guiding Principles on Trophy Hunting as a Tool for Creating Conservation Incentives. A study published in the journal Animal Conservation and led by Peter Lindsey of Kenya's Mpala Research Centre concluded that most trophy hunters assure that they are concerned about the conservation, ethical, and social issues that hunting raises. The study interviewed 150 Americans who had hunted in Africa before, or who planned to do so within three years. For example, hunters assure that they were much less willing to hunt in areas where African wild dogs or cheetahs were illegally shot than their hunting operators perceived, and they also showed greater concern for social issues than their operators realized, with a huge willingness to hunt in areas were local people lived and benefited from hunting (Fig.1). Eighty-six percent of hunters told the researchers they preferred hunting in an area where they knew that a portion of the proceeds went back into local communities. A certification system could therefore allow hunters to select those operators who benefit local people and conduct themselves in a conservation-friendly manner. = In America = Cougar hunting quotas have had a negative effect on the animals' population. According to Robert Wieglus, director of Large Carnivore Conservation Lab at Washington State University, when too many cougars are killed demographic issues can be seen in the cat's population. The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young \\"teenage\\" males who are hormonal and unpredictable. These \\"teenage\\" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before. \\"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing\\", Wielgus said of his work in Washington.  Economic influence  = Benefits of trophy hunting = According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, trophy hunting provides an economic incentive for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting reduces the threat of the species' extinction.http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf Moose head and deer antlers mounted as hunting trophies According to Dr G.C. Dry, former President of Wildlife Ranching South Africa, wildlife ranches have contributed greatly to the South African economy. He has argued that commercial wildlife ranching is about appropriate land-use and rural development; it is less about animals per se, not a white affluent issue, not a conservation at-all-cost issue, but about economic sustainability. Dr. Dry asserts that commercial wildlife ranching is a land-use option that is ecologically appropriate, economically sustainable, politically sensitive, and socially just. The International Union for Conservation of Nature reports in \\"The baby and the bathwater: trophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods\\", that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species, but that there are valid concerns about the legality, sustainability and ethics of some hunting practices. The paper concludes that in some contexts, there may be valid and feasible alternatives to trophy hunting that can deliver the above-mentioned benefits, but identifying, funding and implementing these requires genuine consultation and engagement with affected governments, the private sector and communities.https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/trophy_hunting_conservation_and_rural_livelihoods.pdf  Regulations, ban and effects  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service imposed a ban on imports. This ban is limited to elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Tanzania for 2014‚Äì2015 and likely going to extend and expand. In 2001, Botswana instituted a one-year ban on lion hunting. They had previously permitted the hunting of fifty lions each year, which caused a shortage in mature males in the population, as the hunters preferred the lions with the largest manes. After the ban, Safari Club International including prominent member, former President George H. W. Bush successfully lobbied the Botswanan government to reverse the ban. Botswana again banned trophy hunting in 2014, and now villagers claim they get no income from trophy hunters, suffer from damaged crop fields caused by elephants and buffaloes, and lions killing their livestock. Some conservationists claim trophy hunting is more effective for wildlife management than a complete hunting ban. In the wake of the killing of Cecil the lion, Emirates Airlines, American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines have all banned the transportation of hunting trophies on flights. On the contrary, Kenya, which banned trophy hunting in 1977, has seen a 70 percent decline of wild animals according to Laurence Frank, a zoology researcher at the University of California at Berkeley and director of the conservation group Living with Lions. Because the government has no incentive to protect wild animals, effective enforcement on protecting animals has been a disaster according to Frank. Restrictions on lion hunting may also reduce tolerance for the species among communities where local people benefit from trophy hunting, and may reduce funds available for anti-poaching.  Controversy  = Opposition =  Arguments Opponents voice strong opinions against trophy hunting based on the belief that it is immoral and lacks financial contribution to the communities affected by trophy hunting and to conservation efforts. National Geographic, for example, published a report in 2015 which says government corruption, especially in Zimbabwe, prevents elephant hunting fees from going towards any conservation efforts, with authorities keeping the fees for themselves. Governments also take more wildlife areas to profit from poaching and trophy hunting. Similarly, a 2017 report by the Australian-based Economists at Large says that trophy hunting amounted to less than one percent of tourism revenue in eight African countries. According to an IUCN report from 2009, surrounding communities in West Africa receive little benefit from the hunting-safari business. Trophy hunting has received a large amount of popular attention internationally as a result of incidents such as the death of Cecil the Lion, garnering a widely negative perception of the practice in many sectors of the general populace. Attention has been drawn both popularly and academically to the ethics of trophy hunting and trophy hunting facilities. Generally speaking, ethical arguments against trophy or sport hunting practices frame them as exploitative and abusive against animals. Evidence has been found illustrating that wild game hunting can also impact the reproductive and social processes of animal species, as well as increase aggression between species members, ultimately impacting the stability of different wildlife communities. Opponents also cite that the genetic health and social behaviors of species is adversely affected because hunters often kill the largest or most significant male of a species. The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.' Cited from The League Against Cruel Sports \\"A November 2004 study by the University of Port Elizabeth estimated that eco-tourism on private game reserves generated more than 15 times the income of livestock or game rearing or overseas hunting. (1) Eco-tourism lodges in Eastern Cape Province produce almost 2000 rand (¬£180) per hectare. Researchers also noted that more jobs were created and staff received \\"extensive skills training\\". A 2011 study published in Conservation Biology found that trophy hunting was the leading factor in the decline of lion populations in Tanzania. The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources in 2016 concluded that trophy hunting may be contributing to the extinction of certain animals. The 25 page report is called Missing the Mark. Nnimmo Bassey, Nigerian environmental activist and director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, asserted in November 2017 that \\"wildlife in Africa have been decimated by trophy hunters\\". Conservationist groups such as IFAW and HSUS assert that trophy hunting is a key factor in the \\"silent extinction\\" of giraffes. According to IFAW's analysis of CITES database, 1.7 million animals were killed by trophy hunters between 2004 and 2014, with roughly 200,000 of these being members of threatened species.  Positions  Many of the 189 countries signatory to the 1992 Rio Accord have developed biodiversity action plans that discourage the hunting of protected species. Trophy hunting is also opposed by the group In Defense of Animals (IDA) on the basis that trophy hunters are not aimed at conservation, they are instead aimed at glory in hunting and killing the biggest and rarest animals. They contend that the trophy hunters are not interested in even saving endangered animals, and are more than willing to pay the very high prices for permits to kill members of an endangered species. PETA is also opposed to trophy hunting on the basis that it is unnecessary and cruel. The opposition from PETA is on the basis of the moral justification of hunting for sport. The pain that the animals suffer is not justified by the enjoyment that the hunters receive. The League Against Cruel Sports also opposes trophy hunting for the reason that even if the animal that is being hunted for a trophy is not endangered, it is still unjustified to kill them. They respond to claims of economic benefits as false justifications for the continuance of the inhumane sport. The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an elephant conservation organization, believe that elephants bring in significantly more revenue from tourists who want to see them alive. Their 2013 report stated \\"alive, they benefit local communities and economies; dead they benefit criminal and even terrorist groups\\". = Support =  Arguments Proponents of trophy hunting claim many hunting fees go toward conservation, such as portions of hunting license fees, hunting tags and ammunition taxes. In addition, private groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which contributed more than $400,000 in 2005,State Agencies Receive Over $420,000 in Grants Through Hunting Heritage Partnership and smaller private groups also contribute significant funds; for example, the Grand Slam Club Ovis has raised more than $6.3 million to date for the conservation of sheep.Grand Slam Club Ovis Proponents of game and trophy hunting claim that the economic benefits presented by the practice are essential to nations in which ecotourism is not as viable or popular. Additionally, locals in more rural areas of Africa express that there is tension between human communities and certain species that pose dangers to them and their livestock. Members of these communities rely on current hunting regulations that allow them to retaliate or preempt against the threats these species can pose. Programs such as CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) in Zimbabwe have been implemented to allow landowners to benefit from the presence of wildlife on their land by marketing it to individuals such as safari owners or game ranch owners, framing wildlife as a renewable resource. Aside from the economic boon presented by the program, CAMPFIRE has also served to mitigate illegal poaching or hunting in certain areas, as well as helping farmers more easily access essential resources that they sometimes have to compete with animal communities for.  Positions  Organizations that support trophy hunting as a tool for conservation include Boone and Crockett Club, The National Wildlife Federation, The Wilderness Society, The Izzaak Walton League of America, North American Wildlife Foundation, Outdoor Writers Association of America, Ducks Unlimited, World Wildlife Fund, The American Forestry Association, Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, Wildlife Management Institute, The Wildlife Society, and IUCN.http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_informingdecisionsontrophyhuntingv1.pdf The President of Panthera, a conservation group for big cats and their ecosystems, argues that trophy hunting gives African governments economic incentives to leave safari blocks as wilderness, and that hunting remains the most effective tool to protect wilderness in many parts of Africa.http://www.panthera.org/node/1253http://www.panthera.org/node/249 = Neutrality = Organizations that are neutral and do not oppose trophy hunting include The National Audubon Society, Defenders of Wildlife, and The Sierra Club = Proposed solutions =  Certificate system  One proposed solution to these problems is the development of a certification system, whereby hunting operators are rated on three criteria:Lewis D & Jackson J. (2005). Safari hunting and conservation on communal land in southern Africa. Pages 239‚Äì251 in R. Woodroffe, S. Thirgood, and A. Rabinowitz, editors. People and wildlife: conflict or coexistence? Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom. # Their commitment to conservation, e.g. by adhering to quotas and contributing to anti-poaching efforts. # How much they benefit and involve local people. # Whether they comply with agreed ethical standards. = Challenges to the certificate system = Introducing a certification system however remains challenging because it requires co-operation between hunting operators, conservationists and governments. It also requires difficult questions to be answered, including; what constitutes ethical hunting? Who constitutes local communities and what represents adequate benefits for them? Some researchers also continue to express concern that allowing trophy hunts for endangered animals might send the wrong message to influential people around the world, perhaps with adverse consequences for conservation. For example, it has been suggested that people will contribute less money to conservation organizations because allowing hunting of a species could suggest that it does not need saving.  In the media  The controversy surrounding trophy hunting was further ignited when an American dentist Walter Palmer gained internet infamy when a picture of him and the dead lion Cecil went viral. Palmer is an experienced and avid big-game hunter and reportedly paid over 50,000 US dollars to hunt and kill the lion. Cecil the lion was one of the most known and studied lions in Zimbabwe. The lion was lured from the park and, after being injured by an arrow and stalked for 40 hours, Cecil was finally killed. Palmer was reportedly attracted to Cecil's rare black mane. Had Cecil been in the park, it would have been illegal to kill him. The actions the dentist and his hired hunter took in luring out of the park were not endorsed by trophy hunting officials in Zimbabwe.

M√ºnzenberg was the first head of the Young Communist International in 1919‚Äì20 and established the famine-relief and propaganda organization Workers International Relief in 1921. He was a leading propagandist for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during the Weimar Era, but later grew disenchanted with the USSR due to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of the 1930s. Condemned by Stalin to be purged and arrested for treason,Koch, Stephen, Double Lives: Stalin, Willi M√ºnzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals, New York: Enigma Books (2004), Revised Edition, pp. 14, 20, 77, 90‚Äì91, 333, 362 M√ºnzenberg left the KPD and in Paris became a leader of the German √©migr√© anti-fascism and anti-Stalinist community until forced to flee the Nazi advance into France in 1940. Arrested and imprisoned by the Daladier government in France, he escaped prison camp only to be found dead a few months later in a forest near the commune of Saint-Marcellin, France.Mora, Henri.

The son of a tavern keeper, M√ºnzenberg grew up in poverty. As a young man, he became involved with trade unions and in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). When the SPD split in 1914 between the moderate Majority SPD (MSPD) and the radical Independent SPD (USPD) over the issue of World War I, M√ºnzenberg sided with the USPD. During World War I, M√ºnzenberg often visited Vladimir Lenin at his home in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. In 1918, M√ºnzenberg was a founding member of the KPD. M√ºnzenberg was also the head of the Young Communist International and was the delegate of the YCI to the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International in 1920.M√ºnzenberg was disappointed that the 2nd Congress was unable to take up the matter of the Young Communist movement due to insufficient time and called an informal conference to discuss the so-called \\"youth question\\" for 7 August 1920. See: John Riddell (ed.), Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920. In Two Volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 2, p. 773. Political career In 1924, M√ºnzenberg was elected to the Reichstag as a KPD member. He served until the KPD was banned in 1933. M√ºnzenberg was one of the few KPD leaders in 1933, and one of the few of working-class origin, which was a source of immense pride for him. During the Weimar period, M√ºnzenberg earned the reputation of a brilliant propagandist. His first major success was an effort to raise money and food for the victims of the Russian famine of 1921. M√ºnzenberg was reputed to have raised millions of dollars for aid to the Soviet Union during the famine through his famous organization Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe (IAH; \\"Workers International Relief\\"), based in Berlin.McMeekin, Sean, The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi M√ºnzenberg, Moscow's Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West, 1917-1940, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press (2004), p. 128 In 1924 he launched Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung, which became the most widely read socialist pictorial newspaper in Germany.Brasken, Kasper. \\"Willi M√ºnzenberg und die Internationale Arbeiterhilfe (IAH) 1921 bis 1933: eine neue Geschichte\\". In: Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, No.III/2012, p. 74 In addition, M√ºnzenberg worked closely with the Comintern and the Soviet secret police (known as the Cheka in 1917‚Äì22 and as the OGPU in 1922‚Äì34) to advance the Communist cause internationally. To broaden the Comintern's influence, M√ºnzenberg created numerous front organizations, which he termed \\"Innocents' Clubs\\".Wilford, Hugh, The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America, Harvard University Press, 2008; pp. 12‚Äì13 These front groups, such the Friends of Soviet Russia, the World League Against Imperialism and Workers International Relief were superficially devoted to an undeniably benign cause such as famine relief, anti-imperialism or peace, but M√ºnzenberg created them to enlist the support of liberals and moderate socialists in defending the Bolshevik revolution. As he told a fellow Comintern member, \\"These people have the belief they are actually doing this themselves. This belief must be preserved at any price.\\" The front organizations, in turn, helped fund the acquisition of the M√ºnzenberg Trust, a collection of small newspapers, publishing houses, movie houses, and theatres in locations around the world. M√ºnzenberg, referred to by some as the \\"Red Millionaire\\", used the businesses to pay for a limousine and an elegantly furnished apartment for himself. After directing the Comintern's handling of the Sacco and Vanzetti case in 1925, M√ºnzenberg took charge of the League against Imperialism, created in Brussels in 1927. The World Congress Against War was held in Amsterdam on 27‚Äì29 August 1932 and was attended by more than 2,000 delegates from 27 countries. Following the meeting, M√ºnzenberg formed the permanent World Committee Against War and Fascism, based in Berlin. The Executive Committee of the Communist International was uncomfortable with M√ºnzenberg's views and replaced him with Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov. Early the next year, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. The World Committee had to move its headquarters to Paris and M√ºnzenberg resumed the leadership. Dimitrov was arrested and tried on a charge of responsibility for the 1933 Reichstag fire. The League Against Imperialism organised a counter-trial, which concluded that the Nazis had set the fire themselves. sent Czechoslovak writer Egon Kisch to Australia where he addressed a crowd of 18,000 in Sydney's Domain, telling Australians of his firsthand experience with the dangers of Hitler's Nazi regime As he was barred from entering Britain at the time of the trial, M√ºnzenberg went to the United States instead. He toured the northeastern and midwestern US in June 1934 with Welsh Labour figure Aneurin Bevan, his wife Babette Gross, and SPD lawyer Kurt Rosenfeld. Speaking at well-attended rallies at venues like Madison Square Garden and the Bronx Coliseum, he appeared alongside Sinclair Lewis and Malcolm Cowley. Pennybacker, Susan Dabney. From Scottsboro to Munich: Race and Political Culture in 1930s Britain. pages 216-217 Later in 1934, M√ºnzenberg's influence reached the antipodes when his Comintern machine sent Egon Kisch to the All-Australian Conference of the Movement Against War and Fascism (an Australian Communist Party front organization). What could have been a low-key visit from an unknown Czech writer quickly polarized Australian society when the Joseph Lyons government declared Kisch as \\"undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth\\" and attempted to exclude Kisch from Australia. With the government unable to produce any legal proof that Kisch was a communist, its case collapsed, and Kisch became a popular speaker disseminating M√ºnzenberg's Comintern message. However, attempts to foster a United Front against fascism in Australia eventually came to nothing. M√ºnzenberg instructed his assistant, fellow Comintern agent Otto Katz, to travel to the United States to garner support for various pro-Soviet and anti-Nazi causes, as part of the 1935 Comintern Seventh World Congress' proclamation of a \\"Peoples' Front Against Fascism\\", aka the Popular Front. Katz made his way to Hollywood, and in July 1936 he formed the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League with Dorothy Parker.Caute, David. The Fellow Travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism, Revised edition. New Haven: Yale University Press (1988)Doherty, Thomas. Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007; pp. 206‚Äì207 Many artists and writers in the U.S. flocked to join the Popular Front, the Anti-Nazi League, and related groups such as the League of American Writers, and movie stars such as Paul Muni, Melvyn Douglas, and James Cagney all agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League. M√ºnzenberg lived intermittently in Paris from 1933 to 1940. He took a common-law wife, Babette Gross, a party member who had separated from her husband shortly after her marriage. It has been suggested that during his years in exile, M√ºnzenberg had some role in recruiting Kim Philby to work for the Soviet Union, but there is no clear evidence. The argument for the theory is that Philby was recruited to work for Soviet intelligence by one of the M√ºnzenberg Trust's front organizations, the World Society for the Relief of the Victims of German Fascism based in Paris. Defection Until 1936, M√ºnzenberg remained loyal to Joseph Stalin and to the aims of Soviet foreign policy. In late 1936, fellow KPD exile Walter Ulbricht, urged him to take up an offer from Dimitrov, then residing in Moscow, to return there and assume other missions on behalf of the Comintern.Brask√©n, Kasper, \\"Hauptgefahr jetzt nicht Trotzkismus, sondern M√ºnzenberg: East German Uses of Remembrance and the Contentious Case of Willi M√ºnzenberg\\", √Öbo Akademi University (2011), retrieved 24 July 2011Dimitrov, Georgi. The Diary of Georgi Dimitrov, 1933-1949. Yale University Press, 2003. M√ºnzenberg refused. Having been expelled from the German Communist Party (KPD), M√ºnzenberg finally moved into open opposition to Stalin. A final article on the disgraced propagandist in the Comintern journal Die Internationale warned, \\"Unser fester Wille, die Einheit unter den Antifaschistischen herzustellen, unser Gef√ºhl der Verantwortlichkeit vor dem deutschen Volk macht es uns daher zur Pflicht, vor M√ºnzenberg zu warnen. Er ist ein Feind!\\" (\\"Our unshaking determination to unify anti-Fascists, our sense of duty before the German people, obliges us to warn them about M√ºnzenberg. He is an enemy!\\") Back in Paris, M√ºnzenberg became a genuine leader of German √©migr√© antifascism, Die Zukunft, was the intellectual forerunner of Encounter and other Cold War publications. M√ºnzenberg continued to work on behalf of antifascist causes throughout Western Europe, where he played a role in recruiting volunteers and acquiring Soviet arms for the International Brigades which fought for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Death In June 1940, M√ºnzenberg fled from Paris, where he had been making anti-Nazi broadcasts, to escape the advance of German forces. While in the south of France, he was imprisoned by the Daladier government at Camp militaire de Chambaran, an internment camp located in the great For√™t des Chambarans (Chambaran Forest) near the commune of Roybon, in southeastern France.McMeekin, Sean. The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography Of Willi M√ºnzenberg. New Haven: Yale University Press (2004), pp. 304‚Äì305 There, another camp inmate, unknown to M√ºnzenberg and his colleagues, befriended M√ºnzenberg and proposed that the two of them escape in the chaos of the Armistice.Willi M√ºnzenberg, Un Homme Contre: Actes, Colloque International, La Biblioth√®que M√©janes, Institut de l'image, Aix-en-Provence (March 1992), pp. 179‚Äì181 Some sources believe the unknown communist was actually an agent of Lavrentiy Beria's NKVD. M√ºnzenberg agreed, and he, the stranger, and several of M√ºnzenberg's colleagues (including Valentin Hartig, a former SPD official, and Hans Siemsen, M√ºnzenberg's Brown Books collaborator) fled southward, in the direction of the Swiss border . M√ºnzenberg disappeared a few days later; it was the last anyone saw of him alive. On October 17, 1940, in the Bois de Caugnet between Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye and Montagne, near Saint Marcellin, French hunters discovered M√ºnzenberg's partially decomposed corpse at the foot of an oak tree.Koch, Stephen.Double Lives: Stalin, Willi M√ºnzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals, Revised edition. New York: Enigma Books, 2004; p. 362McMeekin, Sean, pp. 304‚Äì305, 369‚Äì370 The initial newspaper report stated that the cause of death was strangulation caused by a \\"knotted cord\\"Gross, Babette.

East Lansing: Michigan State University Press (1974), p. 4Survey, Stanford CA: Stanford University, International Association for Cultural Freedom, Congress for Cultural Freedom, Issues 54-57 (1965), pp. 86‚Äì88. but other sources state that the cause of death was a garrote (a weapon usually formed from a knotted rope or cord).Gruber, Helmut Gruber, Willi M√ºnzenberg: Propagandist for and against the Comintern, International Review of Social History 10, (1965), pp. 188‚Äì210. The body was found resting upright on the knees, with a knotted cord draped over the skull. The knotted cord had apparently snapped soon after the body had been suspended from an overhead branch. The police investigation of the circumstances of his death, including the brief coroner's report,McMeekin, Sean, pp. 304‚Äì306: No attempt was made by the coroner to examine the neck vertebrae or the knotted cord to determine the traumatic force used to cause M√ºnzenberg's death, a determination that could have provided evidence of foul play vs. an act of suicide. did not interrogate M√ºnzenberg's fellow camp inmates, and cause of death was listed officially as suicide. However, several eyewitnesses at the prison camp, including Valentin Hartig and Hans Siemsen, reported that M√ºnzenberg remained in high spirits both during his days at Chambaran and in the first days of his flight to freedom after which they lost sight of their comrade.McMeekin, pp. 369‚Äì370: Only one alleged witness, Heinz Hirth, who first reported his version of M√ºnzenberg's death in 1945 in a special report to the postwar KPD, asserted that the latter was suffering \\"extraordinary nervous tension\\". Hirth, who stated that he joined up with M√ºnzenberg \\"in order to keep watch on him\\" stated that M√ºnzenberg belatedly acknowledged his deviation from the party, confessing to Hirth that \\"he had committed very great errors that he could never make good\\", whereupon he began crying uncontrollably. Hirth claimed that the very next day he found M√ºnzenberg's body hanging from a tree. Another theory is that M√ºnzenberg was killed by German agents working for the Gestapo, who had apparently infiltrated his organization in 1939. One of the most notable documents in the Bundesbeauftragte f√ºr die Stasi-Unterlagen (\\"Federal Commission For Stasi Documents\\") archive is a letter referring to information obtained from the prewar Deutsches Institut f√ºr Milit√§rgeschichte files in Potsdam. On 10 June 1969, the head of Hauptabteilung I, Generalmajor Kleinjung (de), wrote to Erich Mielke, then Minister of State Security, The letter stated that there was proof that a secret agent of the Gestapo with the code name V 49 had infiltrated M√ºnzenberg's group in 1939. The identity of the agent remains unknown. The widely circulated theory that he was executed by the NKVD was also countered by the theory of Wilhelm Leo's son, Gerhard, in his reminiscences of the French Resistance: that Wilhelm Leo escaped the Chambaran Internment Camp with M√ºnzenberg and confirmed that he committed suicide, as confirmed by French investigators. Arthur Koestler wrote 1949 about the death of Willi M√ºnzenberg: He \\"was murdered in the summer of 1940 under the usual lurid and mysterious circumstances; as usual in such cases, the murderers are unknown and there are only indirect clues, all pointing in one direction like magnetic needles to the pole\\" The God that failed, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1949, p. 63 Further reading * Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky, KGB: The Inside Story of its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev.

Winners of such important awards such as the FIFA World Cup, the French Open, and Olympic medals, Uruguay has been a constantly successful sports nation in continental and world aspects. Football Football (Spanish: f√∫tbol) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. Uruguay has won an Olympic gold medal in 1924, and another one in 1928, which were considered the most important tournaments in football, before the FIFA World Cup began in 1930, hence the four stars on the Uruguayan jersey. The first World Cup, which Uruguay won,World Soccer was held in 1930 in Montevideo. The Estadio Centenario was built for the World Cup, and serves to this day as the country's main football stadium. Uruguay also won the World Cup in 1950, beating Brazil in Rio de Janeiro at the Est√°dio do Maracan√£. The event has had astounding impacts on the history of the sport, due to Brazil being a heavily favoured team at that time, and is also known as the Maracanazo. Uruguay produces well known football players such as Luis Su√°rez (FC Barcelona) and Diego Forl√°n. Another Uruguayan player, Sebastian \\"El Loco\\" Abreu, became an iconic figure in Uruguay, after chipping a goal during the penalty shootout, against Ghana during the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals. Basketball Basketball has risen as a competitive alternative to football and rugby, and the Uruguayan Basketball Federation boasts a proud early history. The Uruguay national basketball team was placed 6th in the first Olympic Games (Berlin in 1936), 5th in London in 1948, 3rd in Helsinki in 1952, 3rd in Melbourne in 1956, 8th in Rome in 1960, and 8th in Tokyo in 1964. After this successful run, the team did not qualify as finalists in any Olympic tournament, until the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, in which they earned 6th place. Uruguay has also won 12 South American championships, and participated in many Pan-American and World Championships. Uruguay was the host for the 1967 FIBA World Championship. And dud co-bid for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup with Argentina but lost out to Philippines, Japan and Indonesia. The Liga Uruguaya (Uruguay's top league) attracts many players from Argentina and Brazil. In the NBA, Esteban Batista is the only Uruguayan player to play in the league when he played for the Boston Celtics. Rugby union With a history dating back to the 1940s, rugby union is a popular recreational sport in Uruguay. The tragic crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, and the resulting books and films, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors and Alive, brought Uruguayan rugby into the global limelight. Rugby union is considered the third most popular sport in Uruguay after Football and Basketball. The popularity of rugby increased significantly, after the national side qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, and the subsequent 2003 Rugby World Cup, this saw a renewed interest in the sport and broad media coverage of the game. Uruguay secured a historic victory over a much more fancied Fiji at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, winning 30-27. This was followed by a string of strong performances against more favoured opposition. The Uruguay national rugby union team, more commonly known as the Los Teros (southern lapwing), represent Uruguay at the international level. The team is governed by the Uni√≥n de Rugby del Uruguay, and are the second highest ranked team in South America, after Argentina, at 17thhttps://www.world.rugby/rankings/mru?lang=en in the world. Uruguayan rugby players such as Pablo Lemoine and Rodrigo Cap√≥ Ortega have enjoyed success in the professional European leagues. Tennis Tennis is a mildly popular sport in Uruguay, although Uruguayan players have not been as successful as the Argentinian and Brazilians ones. Marcelo Filippini is Uruguay's most successful player, winning five singles titles, reaching the quarterfinals at the 1999 French Open, and achieving a rank of No. 30 in 1990. The Uruguay Davis Cup team currently competes in Group I of the Americas regional Zone, and the Uruguay Fed Cup team competes in Group I as well. Pablo Cuevas is currently the second highest-ranked Uruguayan male player.ATPtennis.com - AThi Rankings Motorsport Four Uruguayan drivers competed in Formula Two: Eitel Cantoni, Asdr√∫bal Fontes Bayardo, √ìscar Gonz√°lez, and Alberto Uria. The latter two shared a ride at the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix and finished 6th. Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez won the International Formula 3000 races at N√ºrburgring, Spa- Francorchamps, and Monaco, and finished 3rd in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. He got a ride in the CART World Series for Penske Racing, where he finished 12th in his debut, but was killed in a crash during practice for his second race. Uruguay has been a major force in South American rally. The most notable driver is Gustavo Trelles, who won the FIA Group N World Cup four times straight from 1996 to 1999, finished runner-up in 1990, 2000, and 2001, and ranked 9th in the 1993 World Rally Championship season, with a best result of fourth in the Rally Argentina. The Rally del Atl√°ntico, held in the Maldonado department, is regularly included in the South American Rally Championship. The two major purpose-built circuits are El Pinar and Mercedes, whereas several cities have hosted street races, including Montevideo, Punta del Este, and Piri√°polis. Major Argentine and South American road course championship series have raced at those places, most notably the Turismo Carretera, TC 2000, Top Race, and Formula Three Sudamericana, and also international karting and motorcycling events. Conversely, Uruguayan drivers have raced in Argentina, most recently Juan C√°ceres and Jos√© Pedro Passadore. Currently, Uruguay has national championships for road course racing (both automobiles and motorcycles), rallying, motocross, and karting.

In computer science, a ragged array, also known as a jagged array, is an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different sizes and producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output. In contrast, two-dimensional arrays are always rectangular so jagged arrays should not be confused with multidimensional arrays, but the former is often used to emulate the latter. Arrays of arrays in languages such as Java, PHP, Python (multidimensional lists), Ruby, C#.Net, Visual Basic.NET, Perl, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, and Atlas Autocode are implemented as Iliffe vectors. Examples In C# and Java jagged arrays can be created with the following code: int[][]c; c = new int[2][]; // creates 2 rows c[0] = new int[5]; // 5 columns for row 0 c[1] = new int[3]; // create 3 columns for row 1 In C and C++, a jagged array can be created using the following code: int jagged_row0[] = {0,1}; int jagged_row1[] = {1,2,3}; int *jagged[] = { jagged_row0, jagged_row1 }; In C/C++, jagged arrays can also be created with an array of pointers: int *jagged[5]; jagged[0] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10); jagged[1] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3); In C++/CLI, jagged array can be created with the code: using namespace System; int main() { array ^> ^ Arrayname = gcnew array ^> (4); // array contains 4 //elements return 0; } In Python, jagged arrays are not native but one can use list comprehensions to create a multi-dimensional list which supports any dimensional matrix: multi_list_3d = [] for i in range(3)] for i in range(3)] # Produces: , [], [, , [], [, , [], [] multi_list_5d = [] for i in range(5)] for i in range(5)] # Produces: , [], [], [], [, , [], [], [], [, , [], [], [], [, , [], [], [], [, , [], [], [], [] See also * Variable-length array * Iliffe vector References Category:Arrays Category:Articles with example Python (programming language) code ","title":"Jagged array"},{"id":"1913360","text":"The Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, or TAPPS, is an organization headquartered in the Lone Star Tower at Texas Motor Speedway Fort Worth, Texas.

However, public and private schools may schedule each other in competition. As of 2012 TAPPS organizes competitions for over 200 private schools in Texas. Controversies In 2004 Darul Arqam, a Muslim school in Houston, submitted an application to join TAPPS. Khaled Katbi, who represented the school, had a meeting with TAPPS on November 4, 2004, and did not report any unusual questions. However the school subsequently received a letter which included a questionnaire with \\"Why do you wish to join an organization whose membership is basically in total disagreement with your religious beliefs?\\" and \\"Why do you think that the current member schools of TAPPS will not be biased against your school, based on the fundamental difference in your religion and Christianity, since about 90% of TAPPS schools embrace Christianity?\\" In response the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas stated that TAPPS should be investigated. In 2010 Iman Academy Southwest, another Muslim school in Houston, submitted an application to join TAPPS. TAPPS responded by asking Iman to complete a questionnaire with questions like \\"Historically, there is nothing in the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion. Why, then, are you interested in joining an association whose basic beliefs your religion condemns?\\" Iman Academy SW did not fill out the questionnaire and the attached application, and TAPPS denied Iman SW admission into the league. Iman SW did not appeal the decision. In 2012 TAPPS came under harsh criticism after it refused to reschedule a semifinals basketball game scheduled for 9 p.m. on Friday March 2 despite the fact that Robert M. Beren Academy, an Orthodox Jewish school, asked that its players not play on Jewish Sabbath.Pilon, Mary. \\"Texas Association Criticized for Ruling on Jewish Team.\\" New York Times.

TAPPS eventually relented and allowed the game to be rescheduled under this pressure.Pilon, Mary. \\"Game Time Is Adjusted; Jewish School Will Play.\\" New York Times, 1 March 2012. Web. 15 February 2014 The controversies with the Muslim schools and Beren drew attention to the point where the Texas Catholic Conference called for a review of the association.Pilon, Mary. \\"Review of Texas Association Sought.\\" New York Times, 23 March 2012. Web. 15 February 2014. In 2015 the TAPPS Winter Division 1 Soccer State Championship Game was stopped by Trinity Christian Academy coaches and Athletic Director to protest a yellow card that was issued by the referee to a John Paul II player. The TCA AD left the field of play and met with the TAPPS Executive Director. They walked back to the JPII bench together and the TAPPS Executive Director issued an Administrative Red card to the player, over ruling the referee in charge of the game. This violates TAPPS section 134 \\"NO PROTESTS. A protest base on a game or contest official's decision will not be considered\\" and TAPPS section 27 \\"...may not protest a contest judge's / referee's or other official's decision\\". The cause of the controversy was that after scoring a goal to go up 1-0 with 32 minutes left in the game the player removed his jersey on the way to the bench and was issued a yellow card for this unsportsmanlike behavior. JPII was forced to play 10 v 11 for the remainder of the game and lost 1-2. Groupings Like the UIL, TAPPS aligns member schools into districts by geography and enrollment size for various contests. Each contest has a slightly different alignment based on the participating schools, but most follow the same basic framework. The districts are mostly decided behind closed doors by TAPPS every even year (in February, around the same time as the UIL's biannual redistricting), and are an attempt to keep schools within a certain distance of their home town when attending competitions. Like the UIL, the districts are the first progression to the state championship. Schools are further broken down with a letter classification to separate them from other schools of varying sizes. The purpose is ensure that schools compete only with others with similar size talent pools and resources. Due to the wide variety of sports that some schools do and do not offer, and because some schools are single-sex, TAPPS uses several different classifications for sports (generally the larger the number the larger the school): *Volleyball, basketball (boys and girls): 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A *Football: Divisions I/II and III for six-man football (in I/II the schools are grouped together into districts, but in the playoffs they have separate brackets); Divisions I, II, III/IV (in III/IV the schools are grouped together into districts, but in the playoffs they have separate brackets), plus League (divided into two zones) for the 11-man game *Baseball Divisions I through V *Soccer: Division I for Fall, Divisions I through III for Winter *Softball: Divisions I through IV = 2020-2022 alignment =  6A schools  =District 1= * All Saints' Episcopal (Fort Worth) * Liberty Christian School (Argyle) * Midland Christian School (Midland) * Nolan Catholic High School (Fort Worth) =District 2= * Bishop Lynch High School (Dallas) * John Paul II High School (Plano) * Parish Episcopal School (Dallas) * Prestonwood Christian Academy (Plano) * Trinity Christian Academy (Addison) * Ursuline Academy (Dallas) (girls sports only) =District 3= * Antonian College Prep (San Antonio) * St. Dominic Savio Catholic High School (Austin) * Incarnate Word High School (San Antonio) * San Antonio Christian School (San Antonio) *Central Catholic Marianist High School (San Antonio) =District 4= * Concordia Lutheran High School (Tomball) * Monsignor Kelly Catholic High School (Beaumont) * Incarnate Word Academy (Houston) * St. Agnes Academy (Houston) * Pope John XXIII High School (Katy) * St. Pius X High School (Houston) * The Village School (Houston) =Independent= * Loretto Academy (El Paso)  5A schools  =District 1= * Coram Deo Academy (Flower Mound) * Faith Christian School (Grapevine) * Fort Worth Christian (Fort Worth) * Prince of Peace (Carrollton) * Legacy Christian Academy (Frisco) * Southwest Christian (Fort Worth) =District 2= * Bishop Dunne Catholic School (Dallas) * Brighter Horizons Academy (Garland) * The Brook Hill School (Bullard) * Cristo Rey (Dallas) * Dallas Christian School (Mesquite) * Grace Community School (Tyler) * McKinney Christian Academy (McKinney) =District 3= * Brentwood Christian School (Austin) * Geneva School of Boerne (Boerne) * Hyde Park Baptist High School (Austin) * Providence Catholic School (San Antonio) * Regents School of Austin (Austin) * St. Anthony School (San Antonio) * Saint Mary's Hall (San Antonio) * St. Michael's Catholic Academy (Austin) * TMI Episcopal (San Antonio) =District 4= * Incarnate Word Academy (Corpus Christi) * John Paul II High School (Corpus Christi) * St. Augustine High School (Laredo) * St. Joseph Academy (Brownsville) * St. Joseph High School (Victoria) =District 5= * Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory (Houston) * The Emery/Weiner School (Houston) * Fort Bend Christian Academy (Sugarland) * Frassati Catholic High School (Spring) * Lutheran South Academy (Houston) * Second Baptist School (Houston) * The Woodlands Christian Academy (The Woodlands) =Independent= * Lydia Patterson Institute (El Paso)  4A schools  =District 1= * Covenant Christian Academy (Colleyville) * Lake Country Christian School (Fort Worth) * Lubbock Christian School (Lubbock) * Trinity Christian School (Lubbock) * Trinity School of Midland (Midland) * Trinity Christian (Willow Park) =District 2= * All Saints Episcopal School (Tyler) * The Covenant School (Dallas) * Bishop Thomas K.

In Levantine cuisine, usually bulgur wheat is pounded together with meat into a fine paste and formed into balls, with toasted pine nuts and spices. It may also be layered and cooked on a tray or served raw. In Iraq, versions with rice or farina are found. Some recipes add semolina. Kibbeh is considered to be the national dish of many Middle Eastern countries, including Lebanon and Syria. Versions are found in Egypt (kobeiba), Israel, Iraq, Iran, Armenia (kuefteh) and Turkey,as well as in Palestine, Jordan, and Cyprus (koupes). It is also found throughout Latin American countries that received substantial numbers of immigrants from the Levant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as parts of North America. Etymology The word is derived from the Classical Arabic kubbah (kibbeh in North Levantine Arabic), which means \\"ball\\".Maan Z. Madina, Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language, 1973 Various transliterations of the name are used in different countries: in English, kibbe and kibbeh. Variations In Levantine cuisine, a variety of dishes made with bulghur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called kibbeh. The northern Syrian city of Aleppo (Halab) is famous for having more than 17 different types. These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kibbe sumƒÅqiyye), yogurt (kibbe labaniyye), quince (kibbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kibbe ·∏•ƒÅm·∏ça), pomegranate sauce, cherry sauce, and other varieties, such as the \\"disk\\" kibbeh (kibbe arƒÅ·π£), the \\"plate\\" kibbeh (kibbe bi·π£fƒ´·∏•a or kibbe b·π£ƒìniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kibbeh nayyeh). Kibbeh nayyeh Kibbeh nayyeh is a raw dish made from a mixture of bulghur, very finely minced lamb or beef similar to steak tartare, and Middle Eastern spices, served on a platter, frequently as part of a meze in Lebanon and Syria, garnished with mint leaves and olive oil, and served with green onions or scallions, green hot peppers, and pita/pocket bread or markouk bread. Kubba Mosul from Iraq is flat and round like a disc. Kubba halab is an Iraqi version of kibbeh created with a rice crust and named after the largest city in Syria, Aleppo. Kubbat Shorba is an Iraqi-Kurdish version prepared as a stew, commonly made with tomato sauce and spices. It is often served with arak and various salads. A Syrian soup known as kubbi kishk consists of kubbi \\"torpedoes\\" or \\"footballs\\" in a yogurt (kishk) and butter broth with stewed cabbage leaves. Another soup, known as kibbeh hamda, consists of a chicken stock with vegetables (usually leeks, celery, turnips and courgettes), lemon juice and garlic, with small kibbeh made with ground rice as dumplings.Claudia Roden, A Book of Middle Eastern Food Plate of Kubbeh Matfuniyah, Jerusalem In the Syrian Jewish diaspora this is popular both at Pesach and as the pre-fast meal on the day before Yom Kippur. Some regional Jewish cuisines combine kibbeh with elements taken from Latin American cuisine, for example, it is typical of Syrian Jews in Mexico to eat the traditional kibbeh with salsa verde. On Colombia's Caribbean coast, the most local variations of the dish use ground beef instead of lamb, but the original recipe, or one with mixture of beef and lamb, can be found served by the large Middle Eastern population of the zone. The dish has acquired almost vernacular presence and is frequently served in social occasions at both Arab and non-Arab households. When served as an adopted local dish, it is offered often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including empanadas, teque√±os and carima√±olas. Fried quibe (Brazil) Brazilian , stuffed with requeij√£o, a sauce resembling ricotta and cream cheese of Portuguese origin. Most Brazilian kibbeh uses only ground beef, and not other types of meat.

Biography Leavitt was born in Hatley, Quebec, Canada. Although born in Canada, he came from a long line of early New Englanders. He was named for his ancestor Thomas Dudley, the founder of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and second colonial governor of Massachusetts. His ancestor John Leavitt, an early Massachusetts Puritan, was deacon of Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts, when it was built in the 17th century. Leavitt crossed the Great Plains on the Mormon trail as a young man. He was a member of the 1850 Milo Andrus Company, which left the outfitting post at Kanesville, Iowa (present day Council Bluffs) on June 3 and arrived in Salt Lake Valley on August 30, 1850. He is credited as one of the founders of settlements in Washington County, Utah. While Leavitt is cited in Jon Krakauer's bestseller, Under the Banner of Heaven, as a participant in the Mountain Meadows massacre of 1857, Leavitt is said to have never discussed the massacre, except to have remarked later in life, \\"I thank God that these old hands have never been stained by human blood.\\" His granddaughter Juanita Brooks later investigated the Massacre, writing the seminal The Mountain Meadows Massacre. On the role of her grandfather, Brooks seemed ambivalent. \\"We can only wonder as to Dudley's relation to the Massacre,\\" Brooks wrote of him. Brooks also devoted a book to her ancestor entitled On the Ragged Edge: The Life and Times of Dudley Leavitt. Later in his life, Leavitt became pivotal in dealing with the Indian tribes of southern Utah on behalf of the Mormon settlers. He was credited by Brooks for having intervened with the Indians in Southern Utah, preventing an attack on non-Mormon settlers. Leavitt married several wives and spent a decade hiding from federal officers seeking to apprehend polygamists.Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, Dan L. Thrapp, University of Nebraska Press, 1991 Leavitt and his wives, circa 1880 Leavitt died in Bunkerville, Nevada, near Mesquite, in 1908. Although polygamy had been outlawed, he never abandoned his several families, according to historians. Notable descendants * Juanita Brooks * Mike Leavitt * David O.

It was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and three research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Milton Park, near Oxford, England. History Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger and Kevin J. Kinsella. . The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book, The Billion-Dollar Molecule and it's further developed in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma. By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area. By 2019 there were about 2,500 employees. Since late 2011, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor's 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period. In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it marked the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area worked together. On 23 January 2019, Ian Smith, the COO and interim CFO of Vertex was terminated from his position for undisclosed personal behavior that violated established company code of conduct rules. In June of the same year, Vertex announced it would acquire Exonics Therapeutics for up to $1 billion and collaborate with CRISPR Therapeutics, boosting its development of treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. In September 2019 the company announced it would acquire Semma Therapeutics for $950 million in cash. Semma Therapeutics created a \\"small, implantable device that holds millions of replacement beta cells, letting glucose and insulin through but keeping immune cells out.\\" On 1 April 2020, former Chief Medical Officer, Reshma Kewalramani, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Former CEO and President Jeffrey Leiden transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, as of 1 April 2020. Dr. Leiden will serve as Executive Chairman until April 2023. Medicines =Ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor= In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On 31 January 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval of the first drug, Kalydeco, to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. In 2017 Vertex marketed the drug for $311,000 per year. Vertex also studied ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor) for the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF), known as F508del, and published the first set of results in 2012. Vertex produced the drug after 13 years of research and development, with $70 million in support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients. Subsequently, the hospitals decided to continue to pay for the drug for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between ¬£335,000 and ¬£1,274,000‚Äîfar above the NICE thresholds of ¬£20,000-¬£30,000. On 5 November 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In 2015, FDA approved the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor to treat CF in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation. The combination drug is marketed under the tradename Orkambi. On 28 March 2017, Vertex announced Phase 3 data from a dual combination treatment, tezacaftor plus ivacaftor, in patients with cystic fibrosis. On 12 February 2018, the FDA approved the combination, marketed as Symdeko. = Triple combination treatments = In 2016, Vertex began developing a new group of CFTR modulators in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. In 2017, the company reported results that showed benefits for patients with different mutations that represent 90% of the CF population. On 22 October 2019, the FDA approved Vertex's Triple-combo therapy \\"TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor)\\" for patients 12 and older with at least one F508del mutation. This approval came only 2 months after the NDA was filed. Trikafta is approved for approximately 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. = Genetic therapies = * In 2015, Vertex entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to develop gene-editing therapies for genetic diseases. In May 2020, CTX001 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and from the European Medicines Agency for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Announce FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) Designation Granted to CTX001‚Ñ¢ for the Treatment of Severe Hemoglobinopathies, PM Vertex May 11, 2020; retrieved May 11, 2020 * In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF; Vertex paid Moderna $20M in cash and provided an additional $20M in cash in exchange for a convertible note that Vertex can cash in for stock. Vertex also promised to pay up to $275M in milestone payments. * In 2019, Vertex established a research collaboration with Arbor Biotechnologies to discover novel proteins to advance the development of new gene-edition therapies for cystic fibrosis and four other diseases. * Vertex's product pipeline includes drug regimens targeting specialty diseases like sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia Duchenne muscular dystrophy, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, pain, and APOL1-mediated kidney diseases. = Historical =  Telaprevir  In 2014, Vertex discontinued telaprevir. In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek) as an oral treatment for hepatitis C. Development and commercialization of telaprevir was shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor. CEO compensation In 2015, several media outlets reported CEO Jeffrey Leiden's 2014 compensation to be approximately US$48.5 million. Vertex shareholders opted for a reduction in CEO compensation in 2015 and 2016, resulting in 2016 earnings of US$17.4 million.  Pricing in the UK  Criticism of Vertex-based around claims that the pricing of their groundbreaking cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi (priced at to per patient per year, depending on the patient's country), limited access to the drug for children and young adults with cystic fibrosis, resulted in campaigns by concerned parent groups and allegations of unfair pricing by the UK's National Health Service. In March 2019, Vertex was legally required to destroy 7,880 packs of Orkambi that reached their expiry dates during negotiations with the NHS concerning the drug's pricing. On October 24, 2019, NHS England agreed to fund wider access to all of the pharmaceutical company's cystic fibrosis medications that were already licensed at that time, such as Orkambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco, and any future indications of these medicines. The funding agreement was finalized soon after Vertex signed reimbursement deals elsewhere, including NHS Scotland, Spain and Australia. The NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland will be offered equivalent pricing terms. On June 30, 2020, Vertex and NHS expanded the agreement to include reimbursement of Kaftrio, making CF patients in England to be among the first in Europe to access public funding for this medicine upon its approval by the European Commission. By October 2019, Vertex's CF medicines were publicly funded in 17 countries. Venture philanthropy In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex‚Äî when it was a small start-up biotechnology company‚Äî to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million. In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the foundation's 2013 budget. Proponents of venture philanthropy say the high financial return helps speed drug development and also provides potential monetary rewards that can go to more research. By 2015 the annual price of Kalydeco had been increased to more than $300,000 per patient. According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives \\"grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options\\" and at \\"one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day.\\" Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices. The company responded in an email that \\"while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval.\\" On 15 April 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry. While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that \\"More than 25% of people are saying (in a surveys conducted by the CFF) that they are skipping medications or delaying medications or skipping doctor appointments because of cost of care issues.\\" She added that \\"one of the things that the Foundation has done,\\" is to \\"develop resources that can help patients bridge that gap through patient access programs, and so forth.\\"  See also  * Cystic Fibrosis Foundation * Telaprevir References  External links  Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Pharmaceutical companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Boston Category:Biotechnology companies established in 1989 Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1989 Category:Health care companies based in Massachusetts Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Orphan drug companies Category:Life sciences industry Category:Biopharmaceutical companies ","title":"Vertex Pharmaceuticals"},{"id":"1913377","text":"Jerald \\"Jerry\\" Yanover (January 3, 1947 - July 26, 2009) was a political advisor in Canada.

The term is most often used in reference to men (\\"male feminists\\") who actively support feminism and its efforts to bring about the political, economic, cultural, personal, and social equality of women with men. A number of pro-feminist men are involved in political activism, most often in the areas of gender equality, women's rights, and ending violence against women. As feminist theory found support among a number of men who formed consciousness-raising groups in the 1960s, these groups were differentiated by preferences for particular feminisms and political approaches. However, the inclusion of men's voices as \\"feminist\\" presented issues for some. For a number of women and men, the word \\"feminism\\" was reserved for women, whom they viewed as the subjects who experienced the inequality and oppression that feminism sought to address. In response to this objection, various groups coined and defended other terms like antisexism and pro-feminism. There are pro-feminist men's groups in most areas of the Western world. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and with young men in schools, offering sexual-harassment workshops in workplaces, running community-education campaigns, and counseling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also are involved in men's health, men's studies, the development of gender-equity curricula in schools, and many other areas. Pro-feminist men who support anti-pornography feminists participate in activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centers. The term \\"pro-feminist\\" is also sometimes used by people who hold feminist beliefs or who advocate on behalf of feminist causes, but who do not consider themselves to be feminists per se. It is also used by those who do not identify with, or wish for others to identify them with, the feminist movement. Some activists do not refer to men as \\"feminists\\" at all, and will refer to all pro-feminist men as \\"pro-feminists\\", even if the men in question refer to themselves as \\"feminists\\". Others criticise \\"pro-feminist\\" men who refuse to identify as feminist. Most major feminist groups, most notably the National Organization for Women and the Feminist Majority Foundation, refer to male activists as \\"feminists\\" rather than as \\"pro-feminists\\".  Pro-feminist men  Men responded in a variety of ways to first-wave feminism and to the societal changes in late 19th and early 20th century United States. Profeminist men embraced feminist ideas and actively advocated for female equality. While antifeminists \\"articulated a nostalgic yearning for the pre-urban, pre- industrial traditional village, the profeminist position was articulated with a belief in modernity's liberatory potential\\". Essentially, through their belief in science and progress, profeminists believed that \\"suffrage was but a public expression of the feminist challenge to the social order that bound both women and men to repressive social conditions\\" and that in the long run it would be an immense gain for Americans of both genders. Pro-feminist men are considered by some to be a stream of the modern men's movement sympathetic towards feminism. Pro-feminist men seek to add male voices to feminism and advocate change by both women as well as men in their gender relations and social, political, and institutional structures. Some feminists argue that male inclusion in the feminist movement is necessary for the universalization of the movement, and for the movement to remain relevant in the future.Owens, Lisa Lucile, Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' (May 20, 2014). Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Review, Vol. 5, p. 1, 2013. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2439294 Since the latter half of the 20th century, more pro-feminists around the world have become involved in advocating for various causes typically associated with feminism, including but not limited to anti-rape and anti-violence activism, as well as challenging the sexualization of women in the media. Many of these activities have been chronicled in a variety of publications and books, including, since 1983, Voice Male magazine, edited by Rob Okun, himself a long-time pro-feminist. Marge Piercy (1969) argued that liberal male politicians will sometimes espouse feminist claims to gain votes, despite dubious backgrounds and actions.The Grand Coolie Damn, retrieved on May 31st 2007. Pro-feminist men are often social activists like August Bebel.The Recovery of August Bebel, retrieved on May 31st 2007. = Advocacy against violence against women = An area of feminist social work in which some pro-feminist men have participated is preventing violence against women, and supporting its survivors. Anti- violence activists work in shelters for battered women, counseling survivors, rehabilitating perpetrators and spreading awareness of the issue. Many male activistsKatz, Jackson. The Macho Paradox: Why Some Men Hurt Women and How All Men Can Help. 2006. support these anti-violence campaigns on two strong fronts: first, that violence against women concerns all people, regardless of gender; and secondly, that more attention should be paid to the social environments that produce perpetrators. ActivistsKaufman, Michael. \\"The White Ribbon Campaign: Involving Men and Boys in Ending Global Violence Against Women\\", in A Man's World?: Changing Men's Practices in a Globalized World, Bob Pease and Keith Pringle eds. London: Zed Books, 2001. have also analyzed the cultural factors that contribute to violence against women. The White Ribbon Campaign was founded in response to the √âcole Polytechnique Massacre in Montreal, Canada. The movement aims to spread awareness about the issue of violence against women by educating men about the problem.whiteribbon.com = Advocacy against rape = Although men's participation in anti-rape activism in American campaigns is still uncommon, some men have proved valuable allies in their positions in shelters, support groups, and rape response teams.Orton, Richard. \\"Outside In: A Man in the Movement.\\" Transforming a Rape Culture. Milkweed Editions: 2005. 233-248. Some male activists claim that their efforts are met with mistrust and anger. Much literatureFunk, Rus Ervin. \\"Men Who Are Raped: A Profeminist Perspective.\\" Male on Male Rape: The Hidden Toll of Stigma and Shame. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Perseus Publishing: 1997. 221-231. about male anti-rape activists involves men experiencing epiphanies about the emotional and psychological impact rape inflicts on its victims. Scholars typically claim that in order to end rape and violence against women, men must become aware of these issues, otherwise there is no hope for stopping rape. In addition to the struggles men face as a part of their work with anti-rape activism, many men that choose to speak out against rape report social costs, specifically that they are viewed as ‚Äònot masculine.‚Äô Men's deviation from hegemonic masculinity, which is currently characterized by traits such as toughness, dominance, self-reliance, heterosexual behaviors, restriction of emotional expression and the avoidance of traditionally feminine attitudes and behaviors in European and American countries, can lead to exclusion by their male peers. Male activists claim that unless masculinity can be redefined to include both caring for women and being vulnerable to emotional issues such as rape, men will continue to avoid taking action against rape. = Advocacy against pornography = Some pro-feminist scholars believe that the portrayal of sexuality in pornography has contributed to the rise of sexual violence, misogyny, and the perpetuation of inequality between the sexes. They suggest that the normalization of male-dominated, violent, and degrading sexual acts has led users of pornography to incorporate violence into their own lives.Jensen, Robert. Getting Off: Pornography and the End of Masculinity. South End Press, 2007. Pro-feminists may assert that these trends in pornography are reflected by increased acts of sexual violence; and also contribute to normalizing rape culture. As with some areas of feminism, pro- feminists may also believe that pornography reduces women and teenage girls to sex objects.  Core beliefs  As there is no centralised \\"movement\\" the motivation and goals of pro-feminist men are various. One profeminist website claims that among those motivations are: * a sympathy for feminism revolving around a simple acceptance that men and women are equal and should thus be treated equally, that is, women should have the access to jobs and areas of public life as men do. * a passionate and profound commitment that has changed every corner of their lives. * \\"...a radical questioning of traditional Western models of thought, of the ways in which these privilege masculine ways of being and knowing.\\" Issues on which pro-feminists usually campaign include violence against women, sexism,The Origins and Causes of Misogyny, retrieved on May 31st 2007. inequalities in pay and promotion at work, sex trafficking, and women's rights to birth control. Pro-feminist men who support anti- pornography feminists also campaign against pornography. They generally believe that: * women suffer inequalities and injustices in society, while men receive various forms of power and privilege. * the current, dominant model of manhood or masculinity is oppressive to women, as well as limiting for men themselves. Pro-feminists believe that men must take responsibility for their own behaviours and attitudes and work to change those of men in general. * both personal and social change are vital. Just as there is substantial diversity and disagreement within feminism, there is diversity among pro- feminist men. For example, the extent to which men are also limited or harmed by societal gender relations is an area of disagreement. Some men emphasise the privilege received by virtue of being men in a patriarchal or male- dominated society, while others emphasise the ways in which the gender roles laid down by patriarchal society constrict both men and women. Some pro- feminist men argue that those who emphasize the latter, or who even claim that, like women, men too are \\"oppressed\\", are not really pro-feminist or are not pro-feminist enough. Others make a distinction between \\"radical pro- feminist\\" and \\"liberal pro-feminist\\" men, and emphasize their shared commitments and similarities. Pro-feminist men typically also recognise the importance of other forms of injustice and other kinds of social relations. Pro-feminists assume that class, race, sexuality, age and other such things are important influences on the relations between and among men and women. Pro-feminist men who are politically active have tended to concentrate on a number of specific issues, such as men's violence. = Early writings and assumptions = Early writings in the U.S. that the pro-feminist men's movement has identified as antecedents to its thought include Jon Snodgrass's A Book of Readings for Men against Sexism, Michael Kimmel and Michael Messner's collection of essays, Men's Lives, and Joseph Pleck's The Myth of Masculinity. Three basic assumptions of these early texts included the distinction between sex and gender, the treatment of gender as a social construct, and the position that men are harmed by proscriptive gender roles. Building on this last assumption, early pro-feminist men's texts assumed a corollary that if men were made aware of these conditions, they would relinquish their social privileges. Compared to feminism Some feminists and pro-feminists believe that it is inappropriate for men to call themselves \\"feminists\\". This argument takes a variety of forms, including the following: * Feminism is a movement and a body of ideas developed by, for, and about women. * Men can never fully know what it is like to be a woman. * By calling themselves feminists, men could pre-empt and take over the feminist movement, thus stifling women's concerns and voices.Tarrant, Shira, Men and Feminism. Berkeley: Seal Press, 2009. There is also internal disagreement within this \\"movement\\", for example with socialist movements, anti-racist struggles, and so on. Those who claim that \\"feminist\\" can apply equally to men and women often point out that the arguments made by advocates of the term \\"pro- feminist\\" are based in notions of biological determinism and essentialism, and are actually contrary to feminist principles.Tarrant, Shira, Men Speak Out: Views on Gender, Sex and Power. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp 105-112. Pro- feminists claim to be anti-sexist, and anti-patriarchal, but they argue that they are not anti-male. Some pro-feminist men believe that men have potential for good and believe that there is a potential for \\"backlash\\" within the men's movement, a potential for the movement to turn towards the defence of what they see as men's privilege and position, and some say that this has already occurred.Flood, Michael, Men's Movements, in Community Quarterly, no. 46, pp. 62‚Äì71, June, 1998, as appearing in XYonline.net, as accessed December 19, 2012. While all pro-feminist men assume that men must act to dismantle gender injustice, some argue that a men's movement is not the way to do this. They advocate instead that pro-feminists build alliances and coalitions with other progressive groups and movements (such as feminism, gay and lesbian liberation, left-wing and socialist movements, anti-racist struggles, and so on).

It was for more than a century the center of a large, thriving plantation, and the only private residence in the United States visited by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Chatham also reflected the new country's racial tensions. In January 1805, Chatham's slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and assistants in a minor slave rebellion. An armed posse of white men quickly gathered. They killed one slave in the attack, and two more died trying to escape capture. Two other slaves were deported, likely to the Caribbean or Louisiana, and Fitzhugh soon sold the property. Five decades later, in 1857, owner Hannah Jones Coalter (the 77-year-old mother of a disabled daughter named Janet), died and attempted to manumit her 93 slaves after making provision both for her daughter and them. Her relatives sued, claiming that after the Dred Scott decision, slaves were legally incapable of choosing whether to remain enslaved or receive their freedom and enough money to establish themselves in another state. While local judges thought the executors should free the slaves per Hannah's intent, a divided Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. Thus, the executors sold Chatham with its slaves to J. Horace Lacy (husband of Hannah's much younger half- sister Betty), although soon one slave was allowed to travel to raise money to buy freedom for herself and her small family, and succeeded. During the American Civil War, the Lacys abandoned Chatham. Its strategic site overlooking Fredericksburg briefly served as Union headquarters, and later as the major Union hospital during battles for control of the strategic Virginia city and Spotsylvania county en route to the Confederate capital. Due to wartime use and disuse, Chatham fell into great disrepair. The Lacys ultimately sold Chatham to pay taxes (including on their other estate, Ellwood Manor) in 1872. Saved from total destruction as the 20th Century began by a series of wealthy American owners, Chatham was refurbished and became a showpiece. Willed to the National Park Service in 1975, the estate now serves as the headquarters for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. Antebellum Chatham Manor in 1929 Wealthy lawyer and planter William Fitzhugh financed building the main house at Chatham over three-years ending in 1771. He was a friend and colleague of George Washington, whose family's farm was just down the Rappahannock River from Chatham. Washington's diaries note that he was a frequent guest at Chatham. He and Fitzhugh had served together in the House of Burgesses prior to the American Revolution, and shared a love of farming and horses. Fitzhugh's daughter, Molly, would marry the first president's step-grandson, George Washington Parke Custis as well as becoming a leading abolitionist together with her friend Ann Randolph Meade Page. Their daughter Mary Anna, born at Ann Page's estate, would later wed the future Confederate General Robert E. Lee, who freed the Custis slaves as executor after his in-laws' deaths. The plantation included an orchard, mill, and a race track where Fitzhugh's horses vied with those of other planters for prize money. Fizhugh named the mansion after the British parliamentarian William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, who championed many of the opinions held by American colonists prior to the Revolutionary War.Copied from \\"Chatham Manor\\" , National Park Service, accessed 11 Apr 2009 Flanking the main house were dozens of supporting structures: slave quarters, a dairy, ice house, barns, stables. Down on the river were fish traps. Fitzhugh sold the Chatham plantation to Major Churchill Jones, who had served under Col. William Washington and Gen. Light Horse Harry Lee. The elderly Fitzhugh then moved to a city house in Alexandria, Virginia. Jones was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and greatly improved the estate: adding terraces down to the Rappahannock River, as well as began constructing the first bridge across that river to Fredericksburg (it took a year and half to build and but washed away in the flood of 1826, slightly more than three years after Churchill Jones died). Churchill's brother William Jones had long owned an estate, Ellwood Manor, in Spotsylvania County, and inherited Chatham around the time his wife of 40 years had died. Hannah Jones Coalter was William's daughter by his first wife, and after her first husband died, she married three-time widower (and Virginia Court of Appeals judge John Coalter (1771‚Äì1838)) in 1825 and received the deed to Chatham as their wedding present. Meanwhile, the 78 year old William Jones then remarried, to Lucy Gordon, his late wife's niece. Their 18-year marriage produced a daughter, Betty Churchill Jones, who in 1848 married her former tutor, James Horace Lacy of Mississippi, son of a Presbyterian minister.Jerrilyn Eby, They Called Stafford Home: The Development of Stafford County, Virginia from 1600 until 1865 (Heritage Books Inc. pp. 280-281) Chatham remained known for its hospitality: Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe and William Henry Harrison often visited Chatham, as later did Washington Irving. Irving visited twice, while doing research for his multi- volume biography of George Washington, for whom he was named. Hannah survived her last husband by nearly two decades, as did her disabled daughter Janet. The wealthy widow attempted to provide for her daughter's care, as well as free her household's administrator, Charles, and 92 other slaves in her will. However, the Virginia Constitution of 1851 (and earlier Virginia laws) required manumitted slaves to leave the state within a year, so (as had none other than the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall for one slave), Hannah gave her each of slaves (other than Charles, who was freed outright) the choice of remaining enslaved in Virginia (but choosing their mistresses/masters) or manumission and a small stake to enable them to support themselves in another state or country. Her estate other than the slaves was valued at $15000 to $20,000, so they could be provided for. However, her executor (presumably emboldened by Betty and her husband) sought court instruction as to their duties. While the local Stafford court thought the slaves should be freed, the Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. In 'Williamson v. Coalter,' 14 Gratton 394 (1858), a majority of three justices refused to uphold Hannah's testamentary wishes, although she had revised the will shortly before she died in order to circumvent another recent decision refusing to uphold manumissions (Bailey v. Poindexter's executor). Her neighbor Justice Richard C.L. Moncure dissented vehemently, joined by Justice Samuels, who died shortly thereafter. So Lacy bought Chatham for about $35,000, but as discussed below, ultimately sold it in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.Eby at 283 Slavery at Chatham Fitzhugh had owned upwards of 100 slaves as well as about 49,000 acres of land (including roughly 6000 at Chatham), with anywhere from 60 to 90 being used at Chatham, depending on the season. Most worked as field hands or house servants, but he also employed skilled tradesmen such as millers, carpenters, and blacksmiths. Little physical evidence remains to show where slaves lived; until recently, most knowledge of slaves at Chatham was from written records. In January 1805, a number of Chatham slaves rebelled after an overseer ordered slaves back to work at what they considered was too soon after the Christmas holidays. The slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and four others who tried to force them back to work. An armed posse put down the rebellion and punished those involved. One black man was executed, two died while trying to escape, and two others were deported, perhaps to a slave colony in the Caribbean, or to Louisiana. William Churchill gave Chatham as a wedding present for his widowed daughter Hannah and the three-time widowed Judge John Coalter. Coalter died in 1838, so Chatham passed to his wife Hannah, who did not remarry (married women at the time could only hold property through their husbands). Hannah Coalter owned 51 slaves in the 1850 census, and, as an anti-slavery Methodist unlike her late husband, tried to free slaves through her will upon her death in 1857.Ruth Coder Fitzgerald, A Different Story: A Black History of Fredericksburg, Stafford and Spottsylvania Virginia (Unicorn, 1979), pp. 22, 86. Will is Deeds RR432, August 4, 1857; also Weekly Advertiser September 5, 1857 Hannah's will provided that her slaves would have the choice of being freed and migrating to a free state like Ohio, or to Liberia, with passage paid for, or of remaining as slaves with any of her (Coulter's) family members they might choose. However, Hannah's much younger half-sister Betty had in 1848 married J. Horace Lacy, a prosperous businessman and slaveowner at Ellwood Plantation further to the south in the Wilderness area of Spotyslvania County. Lacy convinced the will's executors to seek court direction. The Stafford court upheld the manumissions, but the Virginia Court of Appeals (the name at the time of the Virginia Supreme Court) in a 3 to 2 decision overturned the 92 conditional manumissions (only upholding Charles' outright manumission). The court denied Coalter's slaves any chance of freedom by ruling that the 1857 Dred Scott decision by the U.S. Supreme Court had declared that slaves were property, and not persons with choice.Paul Finkelman, The law of slavery and Bondage: a casebook(NYU)p.132Moncure Conway, Autobiography vol. 1, pp. 38-39 available at google books Ellen Mitchell, an enslaved laundress at \\"Chatham\\", had known of and counted on Mrs. Coalter's promise of manumission. When Lacy's court case took her freedom away, Mitchell, irate, loudly proclaimed how unfair this denial was, particularly as she feared being sent to a plantation in Monroe, Louisiana. To be rid of her (and the problem she represented), Lacy sold her to a slave trader, James Aler, in Fredericksburg. Aler, active in his church and unsure what to do with Mitchell, allowed her a 90-day pass to leave Fredericksburg in early 1860 on a tour during which she and one of her sons attempted to raise money to buy their freedom for $1000. She gave speeches to church and political groups in Washington City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, raising enough money to return to Fredericksburg and buy not only her own freedom, but also that of her children. Lacy, impressed, also freed Mitchell's mother. The Mitchell family moved to Cincinnati in the free (i.e. slavery-prohibited) state of Ohio. In the 1860 census, Ellen Mitchell was listed as running a laundry business. Today, some of her descendants still live in that area of Ohio. The 1860 census indicated that Lacy owned 39 slaves at Chatham and another 49 at his Ellwood plantation, as well as some slaves which he rented out. An outspoken proponent of slavery, Lacy joined the Confederate Army and rose to the rank of major; his brother Beverly Tucker Lacy (a Presbyterian minister) was the chaplain for General Stonewall Jackson, whose amputated arm was buried at Ellwood Plantation near Hannah Coalter's grave. At least two former slaves at Chatham served in the U.S. Colored Troops and survived the war, Charles Sprout and Andrew Weaver, and one may have served as a Confederate scout. Thus, slavery at Chatham ended in 1865 as a result of the Civil War, upon the passage of the constitutional amendment abolishing the institution. National Park Service historians and others continue research, seeking to locate the former slave quarters. As discussed below, the property was extensively damaged during the Civil War. An 1862 sketch by a Unionist New Jersey soldier during the Civil War shows some buildings at the Chatham site that were long gone by the time historians began speculating that most slave dwellings were likely to be in the \\"rear\\", or the field-side area of the estate. This area had been cultivated since the slave days and in the 20th century new structures were built there. The recently discovered sketch shows structures to the south side of the manor house, in an area across a ravine away from the central area of the property. Re- examination of old photographs shows the faint rooflines of structures in that area, which may indicate the location of heretofore unconfirmed slave dwellings. The Civil War Chatham Manor, 1862. From the National Archives and Records Administration. The Civil War brought change and destruction to Chatham. As discussed above, the house was owned by James Horace Lacy (1823‚Äì1906), a former schoolteacher who had married Churchill Jones's niece. As a planter, Lacy sympathized with the South, and at the age of 37 he left Chatham to serve the Confederacy as a staff officer. He served on the staff of General Gustavus W. Smith at the Battle of Seven Pines, and also served as field transportation inspector in the Trans-Mississippi Department.Homer D. Musselman, Stafford County in the Civil War, p. 89 His wife and children remained at Chatham until the spring of 1862, when Union troops' arrival forced them to abandon the building and move in with relatives across the river in soon-beleaguered Fredericksburg, and after its fall later to Pulaski County.http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elacey/chatham.htm Original at Virginia Historical Society For much of the next thirteen months, Chatham was occupied by the Union army; orders, reports and letters referred to it as the \\"Lacy House\\". Northern officers initially used the mansion as a headquarters. In April 1862, General Irvin McDowell brought 30,000 men to Fredericksburg and supervised the repair of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad and construction of several bridges across the Rappahannock River from Chatham. McDowell planned to use the new bridges to march south and join forces with the Army of the Potomac outside Richmond. President Abraham Lincoln journeyed to Fredericksburg to confer with McDowell about the movement, meeting with the general and his staff at Chatham. His visit gave Chatham the distinction of being one of three houses visited by both Lincoln and Washington (the other two are Mount Vernon and Berkeley Plantation on the James River east of Richmond.) While at Chatham, Lincoln went to Fredericksburg, walked its streets, and visited a New York regiment encamped on what would become known as \\"Marye's Heights\\" during a later battle. Seven months after Lincoln's visit, fighting again erupted at Fredericksburg. In November 1862, General Ambrose E. Burnside brought the 120,000-man Army of the Potomac to Fredericksburg. Using pontoon bridges, Burnside crossed the Rappahannock River below Chatham, seized Fredericksburg, and launched a series of bloody assaults against Lee's Confederates, who held the high ground behind the town. One of Burnside's top generals, Edwin Sumner, observed the battle from Chatham, while Union artillery batteries shelled the Confederates from adjacent bluffs. Furthermore, a German Military Observer, Count Zeppelin, from Chatham's lawn sent up a reconnaissance balloon with a soldier to observe the battle, an incidence he later often recounted after starting his air craft factory. alvin T. Embrey, History of Fredericksburg, Virginia (Old Dominion Press, 1937) p.189 The Battle of Fredericksburg became a disastrous Union defeat. Burnside suffered 12,600 casualties, many of whom were brought back to Chatham and the nearby Conway House (Falmouth, Virginia) for care. For several days, army surgeons operated on hundreds of soldiers inside the house. Assisting them were volunteers, including the poet Walt Whitman, Clara Barton (who later founded the American chapter of the International Red Cross), and Dr. Mary Edwards Walker (as of 2015 the only woman awarded the Medal of Honor). Whitman had come to Chatham searching for a brother wounded in the fighting. The carnage shocked him. He later wrote a published a description that, outside the house, at the foot of a tree, he noticed \\"a heap of amputated feet, legs, arms, hands, etc.-about a load for a one-horse cart. Several dead bodies lie near,\\" he added, \\"each covered with its brown woolen blanket.\\" More than 130 Union soldiers died at Chatham and were initially buried on the grounds. After the war, their bodies were removed to the Fredericksburg National Cemetery. Years later when three additional bodies were discovered, the remains were buried at Chatham at the outskirts of the again-famous gardens, in graves marked by granite stones lying flush to the ground. In the winter following the battle, the Union army camped in Stafford County, behind Chatham. The Confederate army occupied Spotsylvania County, across the river. Opposing pickets patrolled the riverfront, keeping a wary eye on their foe. Occasionally the men would trade newspapers and other articles using miniature sailboats. When not on duty, Union pickets slept at Chatham; Dorothea Dix of the United States Sanitary Commission operated a soup kitchen in the house. As the winter progressed and firewood became scarce, some soldiers tore paneling from the walls for fuel, exposing the underlying plaster. Some of the soldiers' pencil graffiti is still visible, with additional scrawls being deciphered by Park Service staff. Military activity resumed in the spring. In April, the new Union commander, General Joseph Hooker, led most of the army upriver, crossing behind Lee's troops. Other portions remained in Stafford County, including John Gibbons' division at Chatham. The Confederates marched out to meet Hooker's main force and for a week fighting raged around a country crossroad known as Chancellorsville. At the same time, Union troops crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg and drove a Confederate force off Marye's Heights, behind the town. Many of 1,000 casualties suffered by the Union army in that 1863 engagement were sent back to Chatham, which again served as a hospital. Postwar years Chatham Manor, Historic American Buildings Survey By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Chatham was desolate and severely damaged. When the Lacys returned in November 1865, over 750 panes of glass had been broken, blood stains spotted the floors, graffiti marred its bare plaster walls and much of the interior wood paneling had been removed for firewood. In addition the surrounding forests had been cut down for fuel, the gardens and several of the outbuildings where damaged or destroyed, and the lawn had been used as a graveyard. Some of their furniture had been evacuated, but the transport boat sank in the Rappahannock, ruining much of it. Over the next years, the Union Burial Corps removed many soldiers' remains from the gardens and lawn for reburial at the new national cemetery in Fredericksburg. Unable to maintain their home properly without slaves, they moved to their house known as \\"Ellwood\\" and sold Chatham in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.Eby at 282-3 Betty Lacy helped found the Ladies Memorial Association of Federicksburg, establishing the Confederate Cemetery, and her husband traveled and made speeches to raise money.Musselman p. 89 The property had a succession of owners until the 1920s, when General Daniel Bradford Devore (1860‚Äì1956) and his wife Helen Stewart Devore undertook its restoration (and made significant changes). Their restoration re-oriented the house away from the west front on the river (no longer the main transportation route); the east entrance became the main entrance, easily reached by the automobile. They also added a large, walled English-style garden designed by the noted landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman on the east side. As a result of the DeVores' efforts, Chatham regained its place among Virginia's finest homes. However, the DeVores sold Chatham in 1931 to move to Washington D.C., where they built a townhouse later also designated a historic site (and once offered to become the official residence of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court). Today the house and the of surrounding grounds are open to the public. The last private owners, Northern Neck native and General Motors executive John Lee Pratt and his wife, purchased the Chatham estate (shrunken to 256 acres) from the Devores in 1931 for $150,000 cash. They were looking ahead to retirement. During World War II, Pratt served as one of President Roosevelt's \\"dollar-a-year\\" men, Pratt met and had as visitors Generals George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, among many others, essentially to get away from Washington to relax and go duck hunting. Chatham's distinction thus continued during their ownership, as the Pratts did retire to the home and use it as a working \\"gentleman's\\" farm although he continued to serve on the General Motors Board of Directors until 1968. Upon Pratt's death in 1975, he bequeathed land around the mansion to Stafford County for parks, as well as a large section to the region's YMCA. This also left the manor house and approximately surrounding it to the National Park Service (NPS), which uses it as the headquarters for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. Five rooms are open as a (free) museum during designated hours (with explanatory video tour); the grounds are open to the public. The rest of the house and outbuildings serve as administrative offices and maintenance facilities. In 2014, the National Park Service undertook tree removal designed to improve the vistas to and from Chatham. This increased the house's visibility from the city, as well as essentially restoring the view to what it had been during the Civil War and preceding decades. Since 2012 the Friends of Chatham, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, has provided additional support for the preservation of the historic house and its grounds.http://friendsofchatham.org/ Partnering with local Rotary and garden clubs, the Friends group supplements NPS-budgeted services by providing extensive garden maintenance and plantings. It has also undertaken repairs of the 1940s-era summer house at the edge of the gardens and a statue of Pan in a scenic gazebo overlooking the city which was damaged by vandals in 2002, and has begun repairing all 80-plus windows in the original house and outbuildings.

Although it is commonly called a novel, it does not follow standard novel form. Rather, it is a collection of loosely related stories, all set in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s, romanticizing bohemian life in a playful way. Most of the stories were originally published individually in a local literary magazine, Le Corsaire. Many of them were semi-autobiographical, featuring characters based on actual individuals who would have been familiar to some of the magazine's readers. Illustration by Joseph H√©mard from Sc√®nes de la vie de boh√®me, Paris, 1921.The first of these stories was published in March 1845, carrying the byline \\"Henri Mu..ez\\". A second story followed more than a year later, in May 1846. This time Murger signed his name \\"Henry Murger\\", spelling his first name with a \\"y\\" in imitation of the English name, an affectation he continued for the rest of his career. A third story followed in July, with the subtitle \\"Sc√®nes de la boh√®me\\". The same subtitle was used with 18 more stories, which continued to appear on a semi-regular basis until early 1849 (with a long break in 1848 for the revolution in Paris). Although the stories were popular within the small literary community, they initially failed to reach a larger audience or generate much income for Murger. This changed in 1849, after Murger was approached by Th√©odore Barri√®re, an up-and-coming young playwright, who proposed writing a play based on the stories. Murger agreed to the collaboration, and the result ‚Äì titled La Vie de la boh√®me, credited to Barri√®re and Murger as co-authors ‚Äì was staged to great success at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. The popularity of the play created a demand for publication of the stories. Murger therefore compiled most of the stories into a single collection. To help establish continuity, he added some new material. A preface discussed the meaning of \\"bohemian\\", and a new first chapter served to introduce the setting and the main characters. To the end were added two more chapters which wrap up some loose ends and offer final thoughts on the bohemian life. This became the novel, published in January 1851. A second edition was published later in the year, in which Murger added one more story. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing claimed in 1890 to be reading the novel, in French, for the 'twentieth time'.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.214. Two operas were later based on the novel and play, La boh√®me by Giacomo Puccini in 1896 and La boh√®me by Ruggero Leoncavallo in 1897. Puccini's became one of the most popular operas of all time, spawning several later works based on the same story.

He was elected in 1808. Early years William was born in King William County, Virginia, the son of John and Mary McKendree. His parents were both of Scottish ancestry. As a young man, McKendree served in the Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War. He entered the ranks as a private, but eventually served as an adjutant in the commissary department. He was present at the siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. After the war, he returned to private life. William was converted to Christ in 1787. Shortly thereafter he began conversing with his friends on the subject of the Christian faith and making them the subjects of his fervent prayers. He soon volunteered to take part in public religious meetings, and his addresses produced a powerful effect. Ministry In 1788, while living in Brunswick County, Virginia, William was received on trial into the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Unusually, he was admitted without first obtaining a License to Preach and without anyone's recommendation. Bishop Francis Asbury appointed him as junior preacher to Mecklenburg circuit and he served for several years on neighboring circuits. The Rev. McKendree continued as an itinerant preacher until November 1792, when, having been influenced by James O'Kelly to join in certain measures of pretended reform, he was greatly disappointed by their failure at the General Conference. Mr. O'Kelly withdrew from the M.E. Church. Mr. McKendree, sympathizing with him, sent in his resignation as a minister. But the Conference agreed that he might still preach among the Methodist societies. Rev. McKendree soon obtained leave to travel with Bishop Asbury, that he might ascertain for himself whether his impressions had been well founded. In a short time he was convinced he had been deceived. He therefore devoted himself to a careful examination of the Rules and Discipline of the Church as drawn up by John Wesley, and as established by the General Conference in the U.S.A. McKendree became fully convinced both of their harmony with the primitive church and of their particular adaptedness to the circumstances and wants of this nation. In 1793 the Rev. McKendree was sent to South Carolina, but returned the next year. For the next three years, his circuit was vast--extending from Chesapeake Bay to the Blue Ridge and Alleghany Mountains. In 1796 he became Presiding Elder. In 1798, he was appointed to the Baltimore conference, and in 1800 he went with Bishop Asbury and Bishop Richard Whatcoat to the Western Conference, which met that year at Bethel, Kentucky. Rev. McKendree was appointed the Presiding Elder of the Kentucky-Holston District, 1800-01. In 1801, the conference sent McKendree to oversee the church's efforts in Southeastern Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and western Virginia and part of Illinois. He subsequently became Presiding Elder on the Cumberland District. He served as a circuit preacher in addition to his organizational efforts, becoming a respected figure in the region. He was the leader of the Great Revival in the West. As bishop The Rev. William McKendree became widely know and most highly esteemed because of his popular talents in the pulpit and his faithful attention to every part of his work. Consequently, the 1808 General Conference of the M.E. Church, meeting in Baltimore, elected him to the office of Bishop. Indeed, when called to preach before the General Conference, such was the power and unction connected with his sermon, that Bishop Asbury was quoted as having said at its close, \\"That sermon will make McKendree bishop.\\" From that time, then, Bishop McKendree traveled with Bishop Asbury, or alone, over every part of the Church. His first episcopal tour of 1,500 miles extended through Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, and Illinois. After 1816 he was Senior Bishop for nineteen years. In 1830, he lent his support to the Lebanon Seminary, Lebanon, Illinois. As a result, the school chose to change its name to McKendree College (later University). Bishop McKendree never married. His family had moved to Sumner County, Tennessee about 1810. So when the bishop was not traveling, he also called that area home. He died 5 March 1835 at the home of his brother, Dr. James McKendree, in Sumner County near Nashville. One of his last expressions was said to have been, \\"All is well.\\" McKendree was initially buried in a family burial ground in Sumner County, but in October 1876 his remains were reinterred to the grounds of the recently founded Vanderbilt University.\\"Sacred Dust: Reinterment of Bishops McKendree and Soule at Vanderbilt University\\". Daily American 4 October 1876 Legacy Bishop Matthew Simpson wrote of Bishop McKendree: > He was a man of great energy and genius, and was deeply pious and modest > almost to timidity. His mind was clear and logical, his knowledge varied and > extensive, his imagination lively but well regulated, and his eloquence was > unusually powerful. He was careful in the administration of discipline, and > intruduced system into all the operations of the church. Bishop McKendree's influence was patent everywhere, but especially was he regarded in the West. He had given years of earnest labor to establishing Methodism on the western frontier. He therefore felt a deep and abiding interest in the success thereof. He thus earned the nickname \\"Father of Western Methodism\\", and was considered one of the greatest Bishops of the M.E. Church. People named for Bishop McKendree include William McKendree Springer, William McKendree Robbins, William McKendree Gwin and James McKendree Reiley's son William McKendree Reiley.

It was established by the royal-owned conglomerate, ONA, before being partly sold to the Moroccan state. 20.7% of 2M is owned by Mohammed VI's holding company SNI. While approximately 60% is controlled by the Moroccan state. It is based in Casablanca. It is available free of charge locally on digital signal with coverage over all Morocco and on satellite television via Globecast, Nilesat and Arabsat. 2M offers services in Arabic, French, and Berber. Background 2M was set up as a second national television channel with the aim of promoting competition and diversity in Moroccan audio-visual broadcasting. 2M started its programmes officially on March 4, 1989. It used to be a cable channel broadcasting uncoded twice a day. After 7 years of activity, SOREAD (ONA group), the major shareholder, withdrew from the management of this TV channel due to financial reasons. The Moroccan state took over the control of 2M with a participation of 68% in its capital. This takeover was supported by a major effort to develop the audio-visual sector. Radio 2M is the companion radio channel to 2M, presenting music, news, and information directly from Morocco in Arabic and French. Content 2M challenged taboos by debating controversial issues and established a reputation for itself as a symbol of freedom of speech in Morocco. The channel regularly broadcasts news, films, sports and music. It is now a government-controlled public TV station and has close under-the-table ties with influential parts of the Moroccan political power structure (the Makhzen). 2M has been used by the government as an indirect means to attack independent newspapers such as Le Journal. 2M has two different channels, a local analog channel and a satellite channel whose name is (since 2007) 2M Monde, which means 2M World. Both local and satellite/world versions of 2M have the same shows but are aired at different times. 2M Monde does not broadcast Hollywood movies and American TV shows because it only buys their broadcasting rights for within Morocco. On November 23, the TV channel aired in its morning show \\"Sabahiyat\\" a segment on how to cover beaten bruises with make up on the International Day to Eliminate Violence Against Women.

To the rear are hoses for water cooling. An ion laser is a gas laser that uses an ionized gas as its lasing medium. Like other gas lasers, ion lasers feature a sealed cavity containing the laser medium and mirrors forming a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot resonator. Unlike helium‚Äìneon lasers, the energy level transitions that contribute to laser action come from ions. Because of the large amount of energy required to excite the ionic transitions used in ion lasers, the required current is much greater, and as a result all but the smallest ion lasers are water-cooled. A small air-cooled ion laser might produce, for example, 130 milliwatts of output light with a tube current of about 10 amperes and a voltage of 105 volts. Since one ampere times one volt is one watt, this is an electrical power input of about one kilowatt. Subtracting the (desirable) light output of 130 mW from power input, this leaves the large amount of waste heat of nearly one kW. This has to be dissipated by the cooling system. In other words, the power efficiency is very low. Types =Krypton laser= A krypton laser is an ion laser using ions of the noble gas krypton as its gain medium. The laser pumping is done by an electrical discharge. Krypton lasers are widely used in scientific research, and in commercial uses, when the krypton is mixed with argon, it creates a \\"white-light\\" lasers, useful for laser light shows. Krypton lasers are also used in medicine (e.g. for coagulation of retina), for the manufacture of security holograms, and numerous other purposes. Krypton lasers can emit visible light close to several different wavelengths, commonly 406.7 nm, 413.1 nm, 415.4 nm, 468.0 nm, 476.2 nm, 482.5 nm, 520.8 nm, 530.9 nm, 568.2 nm, 647.1 nm, and 676.4 nm. =Argon laser= This argon-ion laser emits blue- green light at 488 and 514 nm The argon-ion laser was invented in 1964 by William Bridges at the Hughes Aircraft CompanyW. B. Bridges, \\"LASER OSCILLATION IN SINGLY IONIZED ARGON IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM\\", Appl. Phys. Lett. 4, 128‚Äì130 (1964). and it is one of the family of ion lasers that use a noble gas as the active medium. Argon-ion lasers are used for retinal phototherapy (for the treatment of diabetes), lithography, and the pumping of other lasers. Argon-ion lasers emit at 13 wavelengths through the visible and ultraviolet spectra, including: 351.1 nm, 363.8 nm, 454.6 nm, 457.9 nm, 465.8 nm, 476.5 nm, 488.0 nm, 496.5 nm, 501.7 nm, 514.5 nm, 528.7 nm, and 1092.3 nm.http://www.lexellaser.com/techinfo_gas-ion.htm However, the most commonly used wavelengths are in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum. These wavelengths have the potential for use in underwater communications because seawater is quite transparent in this range of wavelengths. An argon-laser beam consisting of multiple colors (wavelengths) strikes a silicon diffraction mirror grating and is separated into several beams, one for each wavelength (left to right): 458 nm, 476 nm, 488 nm, 497 nm, 502 nm, and 515 nm Common argon and krypton lasers are capable of emitting continuous-wave (CW) output of several milliwatts to tens of watts. Their tubes are usually made from nickel end bells, kovar metal-to-ceramic seals, beryllium oxide ceramics, or tungsten disks mounted on a copper heat spreader in a ceramic liner. The earliest tubes were simple quartz, then followed by quartz with graphite disks. In comparison with the helium‚Äìneon lasers, which require just a few milliamperes of input current, the current used for pumping the krypton laser is several amperes, since the gas has to be ionized. The ion laser tube produces much waste heat, and such lasers require active cooling. The typical noble-gas ion-laser plasma consists of a high-current-density glow discharge in a noble gas in the presence of a magnetic field. Typical continuous-wave plasma conditions are current densities of 100 to 2000 A/cm2, tube diameters of 1.0 to 10 mm, filling pressures of 0.1 to 1.0 Torr (0.0019 to 0.019 psi), and an axial magnetic field of the order of 1000 gauss.Bridges, Halstead et al., Proceedings of the IEEE, 59 (5). pp. 724‚Äì739. William R. Bennett, a co- inventor of the first gas laser (the helium‚Äìneon laser), was the first to observe spectral hole burning effects in gas lasers, and he created the theory of \\"hole burning\\" effects in laser oscillation. He was co-discoverer of lasers using electron-impact excitation in each of the noble gases, dissociative excitation transfer in the neon‚Äìoxygen laser (the first chemical laser), and collision excitation in several metal-vapor lasers. =Other commercially available types= * Ar/Kr: A mix of argon and krypton can result in a laser with output wavelengths that appear as white light. * Helium‚Äìcadmium: blue laser emission at 442 nm and ultraviolet at 325 nm. * Copper vapor: yellow and green emission at 578 nm and 510 nm. =Experimental= * XenonHoffman Toschek, et al., \\"The Pulsed Xenon Ion Laser: Covers the UV, visible, and near-IR with optics changes\\", IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics * IodineHattori, Kano, Tokutome and Collins, \\"CW Iodine Ion Laser in a Positive Column Discharge\\", IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, June 1974 * OxygenCold Cathode Pulsed Gas Laser\\" by R.

It was one of three centers of monastic activity in the region, along with Nitria and Scetis (Wadi El Natrun). It is called al-Muna in Arabic and was inhabited until the 9th century. Only archaeological sites remain there today. History Founded in 338 C.E. by Saint Amun, under the spiritual guidance of Saint Anthony, it was designed for those who wished to enter the cenobitic life in a semi-anchoritic monastery. An account of its founding, perhaps legendary, is in the Apophthegmata Patrum.William Harmless. Desert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism, Oxford University Press, Jun 17, 2004. pg. 281 Amun, who was then a monk at Nitria, one day talked with Anthony saying that he and some brothers wanted to move away \\"that they may live in peace\\". Nitrea had become too successful and they wished for the solitude of the early days. Anthony and Amun ate dinner then walked into the desert until sunset, prayed and planted a cross to mark the site of the new community. The distance was 12 miles, or what Anthony considered close enough to reach in an after-dinner stroll. Kellia was for advanced monks, for those who \\"lived a more remote life, stripped down to bare rudiments,\\" as was recorded in the Greek Historia Monachorum in Aegypto by Flavius Rufinus who personally saw it. The cells were arranged far enough apart that \\"no one can catch sight of another nor can a voice be heard\\". It was only for monks who had first mastered the art of desert living at Nitria. They came together on Saturday and Sunday to share a meal together, some journeying 3 or 4 miles from their cell to the church. \\"They met in Church and, glimpsing this way and that, see one another as the heaven-restored.\\" If a monk failed to appear they would know he was sick or died and eventually someone (individually) would bring food or help or collect the remains. It was believed in the 390s up to 600 monks were at Kellia. By the 5th and 6th centuries it numbered in the thousands. Activity began to taper off in the 7th and 8th centuries due to doctrinal disputes in Egypt, and raids from nomads out of the Libyan desert to the west. During the reign of the Coptic patriarch Alexander II (705‚Äì730), there were schismatic Barsanuphians and Gaianites at Kellia. They were converted to the Coptic church by Bishop John of Sa El Hagar.. The site was abandoned in the 9th century. Kellia was discovered by archaeologist Antoine Guillaumont in 1964, and has been excavated for over 25 years by French and Swiss teams.Roger S. Bagnall, etc. Egypt from Alexander to the early Christians: An Archaeological and Historical Guide, Getty Publications, 2004. pg. 108-112 The site covers over 125 square kilometers, over which many small hills, or koms, were found. Once excavated they were found to contain many churches and living quarters, or cells named koms. Over 1500 structures have been identified but it is probable there were many more. The structures range from single-cells for one person, to multiple cells for two or three people, to larger hermitages that included rooms for older monks, chapels and towers. In addition there were clusters of buildings that formed centers for communal services (Qasr Waheida), a complex of churches (Qasr Lsa 1), and a commercial center (Qasr al-lzeila). Buildings were made with a sandy mud brick and brick vaulted roofs. Most of the recovered artifacts are pottery, some of the walls are covered in inscriptions, graffiti and paintings.

The stadium can accommodate up to spectators all of whom are seated in a single stand running along one side of the pitch. There are open areas for future expansion. In 2008 plans were announced to increase capacity with the erection of a covered terrace/stand at the sea end of the stadium. Due to the economic climate in 2009 these plans were put on hold. The stadium's capacity was temporarily expanded to 4,700 for a Scottish League One match against Rangers in October 2013. The site of the stadium is near the mouth of the River Forth and the pitch used to be overshadowed by Methil power station, which was demolished in April 2011. From its inception, the stadium had a grass playing surface, however, in May 2017 a new 3G artificial pitch was installed for the start of the 2017‚Äì18 season.

Script doctors generally do their work uncredited for a variety of commercial and artistic reasons. They are usually brought in for scripts that have been almost \\"green-lit\\" during the development and pre-production phases of a film to address specific issues with the script, as identified by the financiers, production team, and cast. To receive credit, the Writers Guild of America screenwriting credit system requires a second screenwriter to contribute more than 50 percent of an original screenplay or 33 percent of an adaptation. Uncredited screenwriters are not eligible to win the Academy Award or the Writers Guild of America Award. A script doctor should be distinguished from a script consultant. Examples Many screenwriters have done uncredited work on screenplays: * Paul Attanasio (born 1959): Speed (1994), Air Force One (1997), Armageddon (1998), Patch Adams (1998), Town & Country (2001), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). \\"I really enjoy doing them. I basically analogize it to being the closer in baseball. There's something about the nature of that kind of pressure, where you're coming in at the ninth inning and throwing your fastball to three batters and leaving, that's exhilarating,\\" Attanasio is quoted as saying from an article in the Los Angeles Times in 2002. * Al Boasberg (1891‚Äì1937): The General (1926) and A Night at the Opera (1935). * Carrie Fisher (1956-2016): Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), Last Action Hero (1993), The River Wild (1994), and The Wedding Singer (1998). An Entertainment Weekly article from May 1992 described her as \\"one of the most sought after doctors in town.\\" When asked if she was still working as a script doctor in December 2008, she said: \\"I haven't done it for a few years. I did it for many years, and then younger people came to do it and I started to do new things. It was a long, very lucrative episode of my life. But it's complicated to do that. Now it's all changed, actually. Now in order to get a rewrite job, you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script. So they can get all the notes from all the different writers, keep the notes and not hire you. That's free work and that's what I always call life-wasting events.\\" * Ben Hecht (1894‚Äì1964): Twentieth Century (1934), A Star Is Born (1937), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Foreign Correspondent (1940), Cornered (1945), Gilda (1946), Rope and Cry of the City (1948), Strangers on a Train (1951), Angel Face (1952), and Cleopatra (1963). According to a November 1999 article from The Guardian, \\"[Uncredited script doctoring is] a tradition that goes back to the mighty Ben Hecht. Hecht was a snob, and hanging out at the Algonquin with Dorothy Parker, it suited him to downplay his movie work, so he only received credit for about half of the 100 plus films he worked on.\\" * Tom Mankiewicz (1942‚Äì2010): The Deep (1977), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Superman (1978), Moonraker (1979), and Superman II (1980). He was credited as \\"creative consultant\\" on Superman by director Richard Donner. In a June 2012 interview, Robert Crane, who co-wrote Mankiewicz's autobiography My Life as a Mankiewicz (2012), said: \\"I think script doctoring was an in road for him. People had liked what they'd seen with the Bond films, especially the dialogue. I think that caught the attention of agents and studio heads, and they said, 'I want Mankiewicz to come in here and work on this project.' He spent a lot of time at Warner Brothers and Universal working on scripts.\\" * Elaine May (born 1932): Reds (1981), Tootsie (1982), and Labyrinth (1986). * John Sayles (born 1950): Apollo 13 (1995) and Mimic (1997). Sayles has stated that the script doctor's main role is to help others tell their stories. He decides which jobs to accept based on whether there is a germ of an idea for a movie he would actually like to see. He has also stated that he works harder when writing for others than he does on his own work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzsfp7ufVyw * Aaron Sorkin (born 1961): Schindler's List (1993), The Rock (1996), Excess Baggage (1997), and Enemy of the State (1998). In an October 2010 interview, he said: \\"With the script doctoring, I did it for Jerry Bruckheimer for a while, because I was just going through a period where I was having a very difficult time coming up with my own ideas and I was climbing the walls. So I did what is called 'the production polish', where you are brought into the last two weeks on something that you are not emotionally invested in, where it is not your job to break the story, to come up with the moving parts and plot points. Basically, they just wanted some snappy dialogue for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The first time I did it, actually, was for Schindler's List where no-one is looking for snappy dialogue, but the writer of that movie had gone on to direct a picture and there was a little more work that [director Steven Spielberg] wanted done before it went to Poland to begin shooting. He asked me to come in and do that, but you are obviously more interested in your own thing.\\" * Sir Tom Stoppard (born 1937): Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Sleepy Hollow (1999), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). On The Bourne Ultimatum, Stoppard said in October 2007, \\"I wrote a script for [director] Paul Greengrass. Some of the themes are still mine‚Äîbut I don't think there's a single word of mine in the film.\\" According to an April 2010 interview with The Guardian, Stoppard \\"does uncredited script-doctoring on Hollywood movies, 'about once a year': most recently he worked on Paul Greengrass's The Bourne Ultimatum. 'The second reason for doing it is that you get to work with people you admire. The first reason, of course, is that it's overpaid.' Once, hearing the phone ring at home while in the shower, he took a call from [director] Steven Spielberg on the set of Schindler's List, agonising over a scene in Steven Zaillians script. Standing naked, Stoppard improvised a solution that was used in the movie. He remains bemused by this American habit of invisible script revision. 'I actually got quite angry with Spielberg, who was and is a good friend, and told him just to film Zaillian's script. But Steven, like a lot of other people in movies, tends to think one more opinion can't hurt. He also said, \\"I used to worry about it enormously, but it's a different culture. It's a moral issue, almost. A few years ago, I was invited to a film festival, as a freebie, because I'd done so much work on a movie that they said I should be there. And I said: 'I can't do that, because I'm not supposed to be on this film, and it's unfair to the chap whose name is on it.' But it just goes with the territory: these are the conditions one works under out there.\\" * Quentin Tarantino (born 1963): It's Pat (1994) and Crimson Tide (1995).Dawson, p. 61. * Robert Towne (born 1934): Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Godfather (1972), and Armageddon (1998). Author Peter Biskind writes in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls (1998) that Francis Ford Coppola asked Towne if he wanted credit for his contributions to the screenplay of The Godfather, and Towne replied: \\"Don't be ridiculous. I only wrote a couple of fuckin' scenes. If you win an Oscar, thank me.\\" Coppola won the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) and thanked Towne. * Joss Whedon (born 1964): Speed (1994), The Quick and the Dead (1995), Waterworld (1995), Twister (1996), and X-Men (2000). In a September 2001 interview, Whedon said: \\"Most of the dialogue in Speed is mine, and a bunch of the characters,\\" adding that he was arbitrated out of credit. He also spoke about Waterworld and X-Men: \\"I refer to myself as the world's highest-paid stenographer. This is a situation I've been in a bunch of times. [...] Waterworld was a good idea, and the script was the classic, 'They have a good idea, then they write a generic script and don't really care about the idea.' When I was brought in, there was no water in the last 40 pages of the script. It all took place on land, or on a ship, or whatever. I'm like, 'Isn't the cool thing about this guy that he has gills?' And no one was listening. I was there basically taking notes from [Kevin Costner], who was very nice, fine to work with, but he was not a writer. And he had written a bunch of stuff that they wouldn't let their staff touch. So I was supposed to be there for a week, and I was there for seven weeks, and I accomplished nothing. I wrote a few puns, and a few scenes that I can't even sit through because they came out so bad. It was the same situation with X-Men. They said, 'Come in and punch up the big climax, the third act, and if you can, make it cheaper.' That was the mandate on both movies, and my response to both movies was, 'The problem with the third act is the first two acts.' But, again, no one was paying attention. [...] And then, in X-Men, not only did they throw out my script and never tell me about it; they actually invited me to the read-through, having thrown out my entire draft without telling me.\\" See also * Ghostwriter * Dramaturgy References Category:Writing Category:Writing occupations Category:Screenwriting ","title":"Script doctor"},{"id":"1913567","text":"The Parliament of Egypt, officially the House of Representatives ( ) is currently a unicameral legislature (though the approval of the 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum will create a second chamber, called the Egyptian Senate. The Parliament is located in Cairo, Egypt's capital. Under the country's 2014 constitution, as the legislative branch of the Egyptian state the Parliament enacted laws, approved the general policy of the State, the general plan for economic and social development and the general budget of the State, supervised the work of the government, and had the power to vote to impeach the president of the Republic, or replace the government and its prime minister by a vote of no-confidence. The parliament is made up of 596 seats, with 448 seats elected through the individual candidacy system, 120 elected through winner-take-all party lists (with quotas for youth, women, Christians, and workers) and 28 selected by the president. History and composition Parliamentary life began in Egypt as early as 1866, and since then several forms of national assemblies have been formed, dismantled and amended to reach the present-day form. Since 1866, Egypt witnessed seven parliamentary systems whose legislative and oversight competences varied and reflected the history of the Egyptian people's struggle to establish a society based on democracy and freedom. For more than 135 years of parliamentary history Egypt witnessed 32 Parliaments whose members ranged between 75 and 458 who contributed to writing Egypt's modern political social, economic and cultural history. According to the present-day constitution, the Parliament consists only of the House of Representatives (\\"Ma«ßlis an-Nowwab\\"), a 596-member lower house. The Parliament has lacked the powers to effectively balance the powers of the president. Suspension of Parliament Egypt was without a parliament for three years. The parliament was dissolved in June 2012. On 8 July 2012, President Mohamed Morsi said he would override the edict that had dissolved the country's elected lawmakers, but that was followed by his deposition. Elections for parliament were held from 17 October 2015 to 2 December 2015. Campaigning =Upper Egypt= While parliamentary elections in the major cities are often fixed by the ruling party, elections in Upper Egypt‚Äîthe poorest and most underdeveloped part of the country where approximately 40% of Egypt's population live‚Äîare more free, with the ruling party \\"recruiting whoever happened to win.\\" According to journalist Peter Hessler, neglect of Upper Egypt has also allowed the region to \\"devise indigenous campaign traditions\\". Without parties or local media to promote issues or policies, campaigns consist primarily of evening house calls to potential voters by candidates with their entourage. Visits may last anywhere from only a minute to a half an hour. Candidates are served cigarettes, (non-alcoholic) drinks or sweets; The visits are not confined to a period before the election but often continue even when the parliament is cancelled and elections continually delayed. The group affiliation of the candidates is not party or ideology but tribe (despite the fact that according to anthropologists \\"tribes\\" in Egypt are often 20th century creations). Because family hierarchies dominate most people's lives, candidates seek the support of clan elders who direct family members, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, how to vote. Candidates may successfully campaign without the \\"support of any party or other institution\\" because there are no party networks. They do campaign with family members and when defeated candidates lose face because elections are a matter of family pride. Candidates often have no platform, do not talk \\"about issues, policies, or potential legislation\\", or make any \\"public campaign promises\\". Candidates often sit in silence on their visits rather than formally introduce themselves, give a stump speech or field questions about what they will do if elected. Potential voters will however often ask for small favors such as making a call to a government office that issued permits or handled utilities on the voter's behalf if the candidate is elected. Campaigning involves male Muslims, as candidates seldom if ever interact with women (who in the south are sequestered at home and sometimes forbidden from voting by the clan elder), and the ten percent Coptic Christian minority is \\"basically ignored\\" by \\"most\\" candidates. Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015 Current House of Representatives =Formation of the House= The 2014 constitution that was passed in the 2014 constitutional referendum has put into place the following rules: the House that is elected following the ratification of the constitution must have at least 450 members. In addition, prospective members must be Egyptian, must be at least 25 years old and must hold an education certificate. Also, the president can appoint, at the most, five percent of the members in the chamber. The House sits for a five-year term but can be dissolved earlier by the president. All seats are voted on in each election. The House of Representatives members are elected by absolute majority of legitimate votes cast. The House may demand the resignation of the cabinet by adopting a motion of censure. For this reason, the Prime Minister of Egypt and his cabinet are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the House. When the president and house come from opposing parties (a situation which did arise historically, but not since the 1970s), this would lead to the situation known as cohabitation. =Powers= The House of Representatives has various competences stated in Chapter Five of the Constitution. According to article 86 the House of Representatives shall undertake: *Legislation *Review and approval of agreements and treaties *Review and approval of the State plan and budget *Discussion of the president of the Republic's statement and the government program *Amendments to the Constitution *Approval of declarations of war and emergency In practice, the People's Assembly had very little power prior to the 2011 Egyptian revolution. It was dominated by the National Democratic Party, and there was little substantive opposition to executive decisions. = House of Representatives organization =  Speaker of the House  The House of Representatives Speaker (HR Speaker) presides over the House and is elected from the House membership, along with two deputies during the first session of the season. The Speaker's role in session is to keep the peace and order to the parliamentary session, take part in discussion provided that he gives up his presidency to one of his deputies and doesn't return to his presidency until the discussion is finished as well as ordering an emergency session for one of the House' committees. In case of vacancy in the president's office, the Speaker serves as acting president until the presidential elections are held (Which must be within 60 days). This has happened once, when president Anwar Sadat was assassinated in office, and then People's Assembly Speaker, Sufi Abu Taleb served as acting president. The last PA Speaker was Saad Al Katatny, who briefly presided the Assembly for only 5 months from 23 January 2012 to the dissolution of parliament on 18 June 2012.  Speaker's Staff Office  The Staff is responsible for organization of the house' and its committees' agendas, the enforcement of the House' orders and is the link between the House and different agencies, ministries and other authorities. The staff consists of the HR speaker and his two deputies.  House' General Committee  This committee is formed in the beginning of the House' annual season, headed by the Speaker. Its membership includes the Deputy Speakers, representatives of the political parties' parliamentary committees, and five House members (of whom one is an independent, if there are more than ten independents). The Speaker is responsible for outlining the committee's agenda. The committee is responsible for discussing the general issues put forward by the president, the prime minister or the speaker.  Specialized Committees  These committees are: * Media, Culture and Antiquities committee * Industry Committee * Social Solidarity committee * African Affairs committee * Manpower committee * Housing committee * Transport committee * Economic Affairs Committee * Defence and national security committee * Arab Affairs Committee * Legislative and Constitutional Affairs committee * Human Rights committee * Youth and Sports committee * Agriculture committee * Local Administration committee * Complaints and Proposals Committee * Education Committee * Health Committee * Telecommunications Committee * Budget and Planning Committee * Foreign Affairs Committee * Middle and Small-Scale Enterprises committee * Tourism committee  Ethics Committee  This committee is formed in the beginning of the House' annual season, headed by one of the HR speaker deputies. The membership includes the heads of the following committees: Constitutional Affairs and Legislation; Religious, Social and Awkaf Affairs; and Suggestions and Grievances; five members of the General Committee (of whom at least two are from the opposition parties); and five members chosen randomly from the House. This committee is responsible for looking into the violations committed by House members towards the Egyptian society's code of behavior towards religion, social standards, etc.  Ad hoc and combined committees  The ad hoc committees are formed by the suggestion of the Speaker or the request of the government to study, debate on a new bill or law, voting on the ratification of a new law or bill or a special issue of concern. The Speaker is responsible on choosing members for this committee. The Combined committees are formed by the request of the Speaker, the government, members of two or more of the specialized committees, with the aim of studying a particular issue of concern. These combined committees are headed by one of the Speaker's deputies. The orders of these committees are issued when a majority vote is achieved. Parliamentary Chapter The Egyptian House of Representatives is the Egyptian representative of the international parliamentary conventions. This chapter aims at developing of mutual relations with international parliaments. The General Assembly of this chapter consists of the entire membership of the House, and headed by the Speaker. The Executive committee of this chapter of the Speaker staff office, three members chosen from the Assembly membership of whom at least one is a member of the opposition parties. The Assembly meets in its chapter form every January. Emergency sessions are held by the request of the executive committee to look into any of additionally outlined issues of concern.

Mythic figures continue to appear in fantasy stories. Gay literature is a collective term for literature produced by or for the LGBT community which involves characters, plot lines, and/or themes portraying male homosexual behavior. The term is now used most commonly to cover specifically gay male literature, with a separate genre of lesbian literature existing for women. Historically, the term \\"gay literature\\" was sometimes used to cover both gay male and lesbian literatures. Overview and history Because the social acceptance of homosexuality has varied in many world cultures throughout history, LGBT literature has covered a vast array of themes and concepts. LGBT individuals have often turned to literature as a source of validation, understanding, and beautification of same-sex attraction. In contexts where homosexuality has been perceived negatively, LGBT literature may also document the psychological stresses and alienation suffered by those experiencing prejudice, legal discrimination, AIDS, self- loathing, bullying, violence, religious condemnation, denial, suicide, persecution, and other such obstacles. Themes of love between individuals of the same gender are found in a variety of ancient texts throughout the world. The ancient Greeks, in particular, explored the theme on a variety of different levels in such works as Plato's Symposium. = Ancient mythology = Many mythologies and religious narratives include stories of romantic affection or sexuality between men or feature divine actions that result in changes in gender. These myths have been interpreted as forms of LGBT expression and modern conceptions of sexuality and gender have been applied to them. Myths have been used by individual cultures, in part, to explain and validate their particular social institutions or to explain the cause of transgender identity or homosexuality. In classical mythology, male lovers were attributed to ancient Greek gods and heroes such as Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon and Heracles (including Ganymede, Hyacinth, Nerites and Hylas, respectively) as a reflection and validation of the tradition of pederasty. =Early works= Though Homer did not explicitly portray the heroes Achilles and Patroclus as homosexual lovers in his 8th century BC Trojan War epic, the Iliad, later ancient authors presented the intense relationship as such. In his 5th century BC lost tragedy The Myrmidons, Aeschylus casts Achilles and Patroclus as pederastic lovers. In a surviving fragment of the play, Achilles speaks of \\"our frequent kisses\\" and a \\"devout union of the thighs\\".Aeschylus. The Myrmidons. Fr. 135. Radt, Stefan. Plato does the same in his Symposium (385‚Äì370 BC); the speaker Phaedrus cites Aeschylus and holds Achilles up as an example of how people will be more brave and even sacrifice themselves for their lovers. In his oration Against Timarchus, Aeschines argues that though Homer \\"hides their love and avoids giving a name to their friendship\\", Homer assumed that educated readers would understand the \\"exceeding greatness of their affection\\". Plato's Symposium also includes a creation myth that explains homo- and heterosexuality (Aristophanes speech) and celebrates the pederastic tradition and erotic love between men (Pausanias speech), as does another of his dialogues, Phaedrus. The tradition of pederasty in ancient Greece (as early as 650 BC) and later the acceptance of limited homosexuality in ancient Rome infused an awareness of male-male attraction and sex into ancient poetry. In the second of Virgil's Eclogues (1st century BC), the shepherd Corydon proclaims his love for the boy Alexis. Some of the erotic poetry of Catullus in the same century is directed at other men (Carmen 48, 50, and 99), and in a wedding hymn (Carmen 61) he portrays a male concubine about to be supplanted by his master's future wife. The first line of his infamous invective Carmen 16 ‚Äî which has been called \\"one of the filthiest expressions ever written in Latin‚Äîor in any other language, for that matter\\" ‚Äî contains explicit homosexual sex acts. The Satyricon by Petronius is a Latin work of fiction detailing the misadventures of Encolpius and his lover, a handsome and promiscuous sixteen-year-old servant boy named Giton. Written in the 1st century AD during the reign of Nero, it is the earliest known text of its kind depicting homosexuality. In the celebrated Japanese work The Tale of Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu in the early 11th century, the title character Hikaru Genji is rejected by the lady Utsusemi in chapter 3 and instead sleeps with her young brother: \\"Genji pulled the boy down beside him ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister.\\" Antonio Rocco's Alcibiades the Schoolboy, published anonymously in 1652, is an Italian dialogue written as a defense of homosexual sodomy. The first such explicit work known to be written since ancient times, its intended purpose as a \\"Carnivalesque satire\\", a defense of pederasty, or a work of pornography is unknown, and debated. Several medieval European works contain references to homosexuality, such as in Lanval, a French lai, in which the knight Lanval is accused by Guinevere of having \\"no desire for women\\". Others include homosexual themes, like Yde et Olive.Amer, Sahar. Crossing Borders: Love between Women in Medieval French and Arabic Literatures. Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press (The Middle Ages Series). 2008, xii + 252 p.Clark, Robert. \\"A heroine's sexual itinerary: incest, transvestism, and same-sex marriage in Yde and Olive \\". Gender Transgressions: Crossing the Normative Barrier in Old French Literature. Karen J. Taylor (ed.). New York, Garland (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 2064). 1998, p. 89-105. = 18th and 19th centuries = The era known as the Age of Enlightenment (the 1650s to the 1780s) gave rise to, in part, a general challenge to the traditional doctrines of society in Western Europe. A particular interest in the Classical era of Greece and Rome \\"as a model for contemporary life\\" put the Greek appreciation of nudity, the male form and male friendship (and the inevitable homoerotic overtones) into art and literature. It was common for gay authors at this time to include allusions to Greek mythological characters as a code that homosexual readers would recognize. Gay men of the period \\"commonly understood ancient Greece and Rome to be societies where homosexual relationships were tolerated and even encouraged,\\" and references to those cultures might identify an author or book's sympathy with gay readers and gay themes but probably be overlooked by straight readers. Despite the \\"increased visibility of queer behavior\\" and prospering networks of male prostitution in cities like Paris and London, homosexual activity had been outlawed in England (and by extension, the United States) as early as the Buggery Act 1533. Across much of Europe in the 1700s and 1800s, the legal punishment for sodomy was death, making it dangerous to publish or distribute anything with overt gay themes. James Jenkins of Valancourt Books noted: Many early Gothic fiction authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford and Francis Lathom, were homosexual, and would sublimate these themes and express them in more acceptable forms, using transgressive genres like Gothic and horror fiction. The title character of Lewis's The Monk (1796) falls in love with young novice Rosario, and though Rosario is later revealed to be a woman named Matilda, the gay subtext is clear. A similar situation occurs in Charles Maturin's The Fatal Revenge (1807) when the valet Cyprian asks his master, Ippolito, to kiss him as though he were Ippolito's female lover; later Cyprian is also revealed to be a woman. In Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), the close friendship between a young monk and a new novice is scrutinized as potentially \\"too like love.\\" Sheridan Le Fanu's novella Carmilla (1872) basically invented the lesbian vampire story, and influenced Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Stoker's novel has its own homoerotic aspects, as when Count Dracula warns off the female vampires and claims Jonathan Harker, saying \\"This man belongs to me!\\" A Year in Arcadia: Kyllenion (1805) by Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg is \\"the earliest known novel that centers on an explicitly male-male love affair\\". Set in ancient Greece, the German novel features several couples‚Äîincluding a homosexual one‚Äîfalling in love, overcoming obstacles and living happily ever after. The Romantic movement gaining momentum at the end of the 18th century allowed men to \\"express deep affection for each other\\", and the motif of ancient Greece as \\"a utopia of male-male love\\" was an acceptable vehicle to reflect this, but some of Duke August's contemporaries felt that his characters \\"stepped over the bounds of manly affection into unseemly eroticism.\\" The first American gay novel was Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania (1870) by Bayard Taylor, the story of a newly engaged young man who finds himself instead falling in love with another man. Robert K. Martin called it \\"quite explicit in its adoption of a political stance toward homosexuality\\" and notes that the character Philip \\"argues for the 'rights' of those 'who cannot shape themselves according to the common-place pattern of society.'\\" Henry Blake Fuller's 1898 play, At St. Judas's, and 1919 novel, Bertram Cope's Year are noted as among the earliest published American works in literature on the theme of homosexual relationships. The new \\"atmosphere of frankness\\" created by the Enlightenment sparked the production of pornography like John Cleland's infamous Fanny Hill (1749), which features a rare graphic scene of male homosexual sex. Published anonymously a century later, The Sins of the Cities of the Plain (1881) and Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal (1893) are two of the earliest pieces of English-language pornography to explicitly and near-exclusively concern homosexuality. The Sins of the Cities of the Plain is about a male prostitute, and set in London around the time of the Cleveland Street Scandal and the Oscar Wilde trials. Teleny, chronicling a passionate affair between a Frenchman and a Hungarian pianist, is often attributed to a collaborative effort by Wilde and some of his contemporaries. Wilde's more mainstream The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) still shocked readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters. Drew Banks called Dorian Gray a groundbreaking gay character because he was \\"one of the first in a long list of hedonistic fellows whose homosexual tendencies secured a terrible fate.\\" The French realist √âmile Zola in his novel Nana (1880) depicted, along with a wide variety of heterosexual couplings and some lesbian scenes, a single homosexual character, Labordette. Paris theater society and the demi-monde are long accustomed to his presence and role as go-between; he knows all the women, escorts them, and runs errands for them. He is \\"a parasite, with even a touch of pimp\\", but also a more sympathetic figure than most of the men, as much a moral coward as them but physically brave and not a stereotype. = 20th century = By the 20th century, discussion of homosexuality became more open and society's understanding of it evolved. A number of novels with explicitly gay themes and characters began to appear in the domain of mainstream or art literature. Nobel Prize-winner Andr√© Gide's semi-autobiographical novel The Immoralist (1902) finds a newly married man reawakened by his attraction to a series of young Arab boys. Though Bayard Taylor's Joseph and His Friend (1870) had been the first American gay novel, Edward Prime-Stevenson's Imre: A Memorandum (1906) was the first in which the homosexual couple were happy and united at the end. Initially published privately under the pseudonym \\"Xavier Mayne\\", it tells the story of a British aristocrat and a Hungarian soldier whose new friendship turns into love. In Thomas Mann's 1912 novella Death in Venice, a tightly wound, aging writer finds himself increasingly infatuated with a young Polish boy. Marcel Proust's serialized novel In Search of Lost Time (1913‚Äì27) and Gide's The Counterfeiters (1925) also explore homosexual themes. British author E.M. Forster earned a prominent reputation as a novelist while concealing his own homosexuality from the broader British public. In 1913-14, he privately penned Maurice, a bildungsroman that follows a young, upper-middle-class man through the self-discovery of his own attraction to other men, two relationships, and his interactions with an often uncomprehending or hostile society. The book is notable for its affirming tone and happy ending. \\"A happy ending was imperative,\\" wrote Forster, \\"...I was determined that in fiction anyway, two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows ... Happiness is its keynote.\\" The book was not published until 1971, after Forster's death. William J. Mann said of the novel, \\"[Alec Scudder of Maurice was] a refreshingly unapologetic young gay man who was not an effete Oscar Wilde aristocrat, but rather a working class, masculine, ordinary guy ... an example of the working class teaching the privileged class about honesty and authenticity a bit of a stereotype now, but back then quite extraordinary.\\" Blair Niles's Strange Brother (1931), about the platonic relationship between a heterosexual woman and a gay man in New York City in the late 1920s and early 1930s, is an early, objective exploration of homosexual issues during the Harlem Renaissance. Though praised for its journalistic approach, sympathetic nature and promotion of tolerance and compassion, the novel has been numbered among a group of early gay novels that is \\"cast in the form of a tragic melodrama\\" and, according to editor and author Anthony Slide, illustrates the \\"basic assumption that gay characters in literature must come to a tragic end.\\" \\"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\\" by gay author and artist Richard Bruce Nugent, published in 1926, was the first short story by an African-American writer openly addressing his homosexuality. Written in a modernist stream-of-consciousness style, its subject matter was bisexuality and interracial male desire. Forman Brown's 1933 novel Better Angel, published under the pseudonym Richard Meeker, is an early novel which describes a gay lifestyle without condemning it. Christopher Carey called it \\"the first homosexual novel with a truly happy ending\\". Slide names only four familiar gay novels of the first half of the 20th century in English: Djuna Barnes' Nightwood (1936), Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941), Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948) and Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar (1948). In John O'Hara's 1935 novel BUtterfield 8, the principal female character Gloria Wondrous has a friend Ann Paul, who in school \\"was suspect because of a couple of crushes which ... her former schoolmates were too free about calling Lesbian, and Gloria did not think so\\". Gloria speculates that \\"there was a little of that in practically all women\\", considers her own experience with women making passes, and rejects her own theory. The story of a young man who is coming of age and discovers his own homosexuality, The City and the Pillar (1946) is recognized as the first post-World War II novel whose openly gay and well-adjusted protagonist is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also one of the \\"definitive war- influenced gay novels\\", one of the few books of its period dealing directly with male homosexuality. The City and the Pillar has also been called \\"the most notorious of the gay novels of the 1940s and 1950s.\\" It sparked a public scandal, including notoriety and criticism, because it was released at a time when homosexuality was commonly considered immoral and because it was the first book by an accepted American author to portray overt homosexuality as a natural behavior. Upon its release, The New York Times refused to publish advertisements for the novel and Vidal was blacklisted to the extent that no major newspaper or magazine would review any of his novels for six years. Modern scholars note the importance of the novel to the visibility of gay literature. Michael Bronski points out that \\"gay-male-themed books received greater critical attention than lesbian ones\\" and that \\"writers such as Gore Vidal were accepted as important American writers, even when they received attacks from homophobic critics.\\" Ian Young notes that social disruptions of World War II changed public morals, and lists The City and the Pillar among a spate of war novels that use the military as backdrop for overt homosexual behavior. Other notable works of the 1940s and 1950s include Jean Genet's semiautobiographical Our Lady of the Flowers (1943) and The Thief's Journal (1949), Yukio Mishima's Confessions of a Mask (1949), Umberto Saba's Ernesto (written in 1953, published posthumously in 1975), and Giovanni's Room (1956) by James Baldwin. Mary Renault's The Charioteer, a 1953 British war novel about homosexual men in and out of the military, quickly became a bestseller within the gay community. Renault's historical novels The Last of the Wine (1956) about Athenian pederasty in ancient Greece and The Persian Boy (1972) about Alexander the Great and his slave lover Bagoas followed suit. A Room in Chelsea Square (1958) by British author Michael Nelson ‚Äî about a wealthy gentleman who lures an attractive younger man to London with the promise of an upper crust lifestyle ‚Äî was originally published anonymously both because of its explicit gay content at a time when homosexuality was still illegal, and because its characters were \\"thinly veiled portrayals of prominent London literary figures.\\" A key element of Allen Drury's 1959 bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning political novel Advise and Consent is the blackmailing of young US senator Brigham Anderson, who is hiding a secret wartime homosexual tryst. In 2009, The Wall Street Journal Scott Simon wrote of Drury that \\"the conservative Washington novelist was more progressive than Hollywood liberals,\\" noting that the character Anderson is \\"candid and unapologetic\\" about his affair, and even calling him \\"Drury's most appealing character\\". Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times in 2005: Drury later wrote about the unrequited love of one male astronaut for another in his 1971 novel The Throne of Saturn, and in his two-part tale of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten's attempt to change Egyptian religion‚ÄîA God Against the Gods (1976) and Return to Thebes (1977)‚ÄîAkhenaten's romance with his brother Smenkhkara contributes to his downfall. Tormented homosexual North McAllister is one of the ensemble of Alpha Zeta fraternity brothers and their families that Drury follows over the course of 60 years in his University novels (1990-1998), as well as Ren√© Suratt ‚Äî villain and \\"bisexual seducer of students\\" ‚Äî and the tragic lovers Amos Wilson and Joel. Assessing Drury's body of work in 1999, Erik Tarloff suggested in The New York Times that \\"homosexuality does appear to be the only minority status to which Drury seems inclined to accord much sympathy.\\" James Baldwin followed Giovanni's Room with Another Country (1962), a \\"controversial bestseller\\" that \\"explicitly combines racial and sexual protests ... structured around the lives of eight racially, regionally, socioeconomically, and sexually diverse characters.\\" John Rechy's City of Night (1963) and Numbers (1967) are graphic tales of male hustlers; City of Night has been called a \\"landmark novel\\" that \\"marked a radical departure from all other novels of its kind, and gave voice to a subculture that had never before been revealed with such acuity.\\" Claude J. Summers wrote of Christopher Isherwood's A Single Man (1964): George Baxt's A Queer Kind of Death (1966) introduced Pharaoh Love, the first gay black detective in fiction. The novel was met with considerable acclaim, and The New York Times critic Anthony Boucher wrote, \\"This is a detective story, and unlike any other that you have read. No brief review can attempt to convey its quality. I merely note that it deals with a Manhattan subculture wholly devoid of ethics or morality, that said readers may well find it 'shocking', that it is beautifully plotted and written with elegance and wit ... and that you must under no circumstances miss it.\\" Love would be the central figure in two immediate sequels Swing Low Sweet Harriet (1967) and Topsy and Evil (1968) and also two later novels, A Queer Kind of Love (1994) and A Queer Kind of Umbrella (1995). In his controversial 1968 satire Myra Breckinridge, Gore Vidal explored the mutability of gender-roles and sexual-orientation as being social constructs established by social mores, making the eponymous heroine a transsexual waging a \\"war against gender roles\\". Though Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) was unanimously recommended by the Pulitzer Prize fiction jury to receive the 1974 award, the Pulitzer board chose instead to make no award that year. In 2005 TIME named the novel one of its \\"All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels\\", a list of the best English language novels from 1923 to 2005. Other notable novels from the 1970s include Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976), Andrew Holleran's Dancer from the Dance (1978), and Tales of the City (1978), the first volume of Armistead Maupin's long-running Tales of the City series. In the 1980s, Edmund White ‚Äî who had cowritten the 1977 gay sex manual The Joy of Gay Sex ‚Äî published the semiautobiographical novels A Boy's Own Story (1982) and The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988). Bret Easton Ellis also came to prominence with Less Than Zero (1985), The Rules of Attraction (1987) and later American Psycho (1991). Nobel Prize winner Roger Martin du Gard's unfinished Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort, written between 1941 and 1958, was published posthumously in 1983. It explores adolescent homosexual relations and includes a fictional first-person account, written in 1944, of a brief tragic encounter between a young soldier and a bakery apprentice in rural France. The founding of the Lambda Literary Award in 1988 helped increase the visibility of LGBT literature. = 21st century = In the 21st century, much of LGBT literature has achieved a high level of sophistication and many works have earned mainstream acclaim. Notable authors include Alan Hollinghurst, Andr√© Aciman, Michael Cunningham, Michael Chabon, Colm T√≥ib√≠n, Sarah Waters, John Boyne, Pablo Soler Frost, Jamie O'Neill, and Andrew Sean Greer. Greer, an openly gay man, won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Less. LGBT themes have also become more visible in a growing body of high-quality young adult literature, with notable authors including Alex S√°nchez, Stephen Chbosky, Shyam Selvadurai, Perry Moore, Adam Silvera, and David Levithan. Becky Albertalli's teen novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda was adapted into the feature film Love, Simon by 20th Century Fox, the first film by a major studio focused on a gay teenage romance. Gay pulp Gay pulp fiction or gay pulps, refers to printed works, primarily fiction, that include references to male homosexuality, specifically male gay sex, and that are cheaply produced, typically in paperback books made of wood pulp paper; lesbian pulp fiction is similar work about women. Michael Bronski, the editor of an anthology of gay pulp writing, notes in his introduction, \\"Gay pulp is not an exact term, and it is used somewhat loosely to refer to a variety of books that had very different origins and markets\\"Bronski, Michael, ed. Pulp Friction: Uncovering the Golden Age of Gay Male Pulps. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2003, page 2. People often use the term to refer to the \\"classic\\" gay pulps that were produced before about 1970, but it may also be used to refer to the gay erotica or pornography in paperback book or digest magazine form produced since that date. Speculative fiction Illustration by D. H. Friston from the first publication of the lesbian vampire novella Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu. Homosexuality in speculative fiction refers to the incorporation of homosexual themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres which together constitute speculative fiction. Such elements may include a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) character as the protagonist or a major character, or exploration of varieties of sexual experience that deviate from the conventional. Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. During the pulp magazine era (1920s-30s), explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. Then, according to Joanna Russ, in the more relaxed Golden Age of Science Fiction (1940s-50s) the genre \\"resolutely ignored the whole subject\\" of homosexuality. Some writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work as the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however until the late 1960s few depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions. After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. By the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers. In Lois McMaster Bujold's Ethan of Athos (1986), the titular \\"unlikely hero\\" is gay obstetrician Dr. Ethan Urquhart, whose dangerous adventure alongside the first woman he has ever met presents both a future society where homosexuality is the norm and the lingering sexism and homophobia of our own world. Uranian Worlds, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.Pearson, Hollinger & Groden, p.7 As speculative fiction gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures, this freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction. James Jenkins of Valancourt Books notes that the connection between gay fiction and horror goes back to the Gothic novels of the 1790s and early 1800s. Many Gothic authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford and Francis Lathom, were homosexual, and according to Jenkins \\"the traditional explanation for the gay/horror connection is that it was impossible for them to write openly about gay themes back then (or even perhaps express them, since words like 'gay' and 'homosexual' didn't exist), so they sublimated them and expressed them in more acceptable forms, using the medium of a transgressive genre like horror fiction.\\" Early works with clear gay subtext include Lewis's The Monk (1796) and both Charles Maturin's The Fatal Revenge (1807) and Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). Somewhat later came the first lesbian vampire novella Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) by Oscar Wilde, which shocked readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters. There is even gay subtext in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) as the title character warns off the female vampires and claims Jonathan Harker, saying \\"This man belongs to me!\\" The erotic metaphor of vampirism, inspired by Carmilla, has resulted in numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly implying or explicitly portraying lesbianism. James R. Keller writes that in particular,\\"Gay and lesbian readers have been quick to identify with the representation of the vampire, suggesting its experiences parallel those of the sexual outsider.\\" Richard Dyer discusses the recurring homoerotic motifs of vampire fiction in his article \\"Children of the Night\\", primarily \\"the necessity of secrecy, the persistence of a forbidden passion, and the fear of discovery.\\" With the vampire having been a recurring metaphor for same-sex desire from before Stoker's Dracula, Dyer observes that historically earlier representations of vampires tend to evoke horror and later ones turn that horror into celebration. The homoerotic overtones of Anne Rice's celebrated The Vampire Chronicles series (1976‚Äì2016) are well- documented, and its publication reinforced the \\"widely recognized parallel between the queer and the vampire.\\" Comics LGBT themes in comics is a relatively new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children.The Yellow Kid, first serialized in 1895, is considered the \\"first newspaper comic strip,\\" though \\"the mechanics of comic strips were in use well before the Kid debut in illustrated magazines.\\" With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form of subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comics from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers. Comic strips have also dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide distribution in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips in the late 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Award and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip. Since the 1990s, LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics, including in a number of titles in which a gay character is the star. European comics have been more inclusive from an earlier date. The lack of censorship, and greater acceptance of comics as a medium of adult entertainment led to less controversy about the representation of LGBT characters. The popular Japanese manga tradition has included genres of girls' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s, in the form of yaoi and yuri. These works are often extremely romantic and include archetypal characters that often are not identified as gay. Since the Japanese \\"gay boom\\" of the 1990s, a body of manga aimed at LGBT customers has been produced, which have more realistic and autobiographical themes. Pornographic manga also often includes sexualised depictions of lesbians and intersex people. Queer theorists have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are usually shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is emphasized. Children's fiction =Gay themes= Compared to gay and lesbian teen fiction, sales of gay-themed books for younger children, and availability of these books in public and school libraries remain \\"very dicey and very different.\\" When Megan Went Away (1979) was the first picture book to include LGBT characters. The story, written by Jane Severance and illustrated by Tea Schook, concerns a preteen girl whose lesbian mother and her partner have separated. The first children's book with gay male character was Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin. Originally published in 1981 in Danish as Mette bor hos Morten og Erik, it tells the story of Jenny, her father and his partner and their daily life. Controversy and politicization followed its publication. Some of the best known children's books with gay themes include Heather Has Two Mommies (1989) and Daddy's Roommate (1991), published by LGBT publisher Alyson Books. Both books discussed same-sex parenting and attracted criticism and controversy. The American Library Association ranked Heather Has Two Mommies as the third and second most frequently challenged book in the United States in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Recent controversies include King & King, originally written in Dutch and published in English in 2002. The book is about a prince uninterested in princesses, who eventually falls in love with another prince. In 2006, parents sued a Massachusetts school district after a teacher read the book to their son's second grade class. And Tango Makes Three (2005) by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell has been frequently challenged, and is often on the American Library Associations's List of Challenged Books for Banned Books Week. It was ranked ninth on this list in 2017. The book tells the true story of two male penguins who adopt an egg and raise the baby once it has hatched. While it has been banned and debated many times, it has been awarded and noted by the American Library Association on their Rainbow Book List. In 2018, Little Bee Books partnered with media advocacy group GLAAD for a series of books that offered positive LGBT representation in children's literature. The partnership kicked off with Prince & Knight, written by Daniel Haack and illustrated by Stevie Lewis, which was named to the American Library Association's Rainbow Book List and was named a best book of the year by Kirkus Reviews, Amazon and the Chicago Tribune. The partnership has gone on to include books that also offer lesbian, transgender and gender non-conforming representation. Australian titles include the books in the 'Learn to Include' series: The Rainbow Cubby House, My House, Going to Fair Day and Koalas on Parade. House of Hades (2013), Book 4 in the young adult series The Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordan, features a gay supporting character, Nico di Angelo. A more extensive list of gay children's literature includes: * A Name on the Quilt: A Story of Remembrance by Jeannine Atkins * Uncle Bobby's Wedding by Sarah S. Brannen * A B C: A Family Alphabet Book by Bobby Combs * 1 2 3: A Family Counting Book by Bobby Combs * Oliver Button is a Sissy by Tomie dePaola * Asha's Mums by Rosamund Elwin and Michele Paulse * The Sissy Duckling by Harvey Fierstein * Molly's Family by Nancy Garden * Antonio's Card/La Targeta de Antonio by Rigoberto Gonz√°lez * Best Best Colors: Los Mejores Colo res by Eric Hoffman * Mini Mia and Her Darling Uncle by Pija Linderbaum * Everywhere Babies by Susan Meyers * Felicia's Favorite Story by Leslea Newman * Saturday is Pattyday by Leslea Newman * Too Far Away to Touch by Leslea Newman * The White Swan Express by Jean Davies Okimoto and Elaine M. Aoki * It's Okay to Be Different by Todd Parr * Tiger Flowers by Patricia Quinlan * And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson * Seeds by George Shannon * My Two Uncles by Judith Vigna * William's Doll by Charlotte Zolotow * \\"Mommy, Mama, and Me\\" by Lesl√©a Newman In July 2014, Singapore's National Library Board (NLB), a state-funded network of 26 public libraries, confirmed it would destroy three children's books with pro-LGBT families themes for being \\"against its 'pro-family' stance[,] following complaints by a parent and its own internal review.\\" The decision was widely criticized by LGBT supporters and the arts and literary community who see the actions as akin to book burnings and other forms of censorship. The three books are ‚ÄúAnd Tango Makes Three,‚Äù which covers the true story of a pair of male penguins that successfully raise a chick, ‚ÄúThe White Swan Express‚Äù, which features children adopted by a variety of families including gay, mixed-race and single parents, and ‚ÄúWho's In My Family‚Äù, which references families with homosexual parents. Two weeks after a gay rights rally, these books \\"sparked a fierce debate\\" between the religious conservatives, who opposed the rally, and Singapore's growing gay-rights lobby. =Bisexual themes= To date, there have been no explicitly bisexual characters‚Äìeither children or adults‚Äìin children's books. Some young adult fiction books do feature bisexual characters, including Empress of the World by Sara Ryan (2001), Double Feature: Attack of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies/Bride of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies by Brent Hartinger (2007), Pink by Lili Wilkinson (2009), and It's Our Prom (So Deal with It) by Julie Anne Peters (2012). When they do appear in young adult fiction, bisexuals are often portrayed as confused or greedy. =Transgender themes= According to a 2015 NPR story, hundreds of books featuring transgender characters have been published since 2000. Although a vast majority of them tend to be targeted to a teenage audience, these self-publications also consist of picture books for younger children. Transgender teenage girl Jazz Jennings co-authored a 2014 children's book called I Am Jazz about her experience discovering her identity. Scholastic Books published Alex Gino's George in 2015, about a transgender girl, Melissa, who everyone else knows as George. Unable to find books with transgender characters to explain her father's transition to her children, Australian author Jess Walton created the 2016 children's book Introducing Teddy with illustrator Dougal MacPherson to assist children in understanding gender fluidity. Additional books listed by The Horn Book Magazine include: *George (2012) by Alex Gino *Red: A Crayon's Story (2015) by Michael Hall *The Other Boy (2016) by M. G. Hennessey *Lily and Dunkin (2016) by Donna Gephart *Alex as Well (2015) by Alyssa Brugman * Jess, Chunk, and the Road Trip to Infinity (2016) by Kristin Elizabeth Clark *Look Past (2016) by Eric Devine *If I Was Your Girl (2016) by Meredith Russo *Lizard Radio (2015) by Pat Schmatz *Beast (2016) by Brie Spangler *The Art of Being Normal (2016) by Lisa Williamson In the past few years, transgender women have been finding publishers for their own picture books written for transgender kids.

Missed approach is a procedure followed by a pilot when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing. The instructions for the missed approach may be assigned by air traffic control (ATC) prior to the clearance for the approach. If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the (default) missed approach procedure specified for the approach. Prior to commencing the approach, if the pilot believes that a missed approach may occur, he or she can make a specific request to ATC in the event that one occurs. Such a request may include heading and altitude instructions to avoid in-flight delays (such as holds) and efficiently maneuver the aircraft into position for either its next approach or a diversion to an alternate airport. Generally, if a pilot determines by the time the aircraft is at the decision height (for a precision approach) or missed approach point (for a non- precision approach), that the runway or its environment is not in sight, or that a safe landing cannot be accomplished for any reason, the landing approach must be discontinued (a \\"go-around\\") and the missed approach procedure must be immediately initiated. It is also common for pilots to practice a missed approach as part of initial or recurrent instrument training. In such cases, a pilot may execute multiple instrument approaches in a row, with missed approaches between them. The missed approach procedure normally includes an initial heading or track to follow, and altitude to climb to, typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix. The pilot is expected to inform ATC by radio of the initiation of the missed approach as soon as possible. ATC may simply acknowledge the missed approach call or modify the missed approach instructions, for example, with vectors to another fix. ATC may subsequently clear the flight for another approach at the same airport or clear it to an alternative airport, depending on the pilot's intentions as well as fuel, weather and traffic considerations.

It is located on a complex with the Grady Cole Center. Both are located next to Central Piedmont Community College. Independence Park Stadium, a tiny public baseball stadium, is also close by. Memorial Stadium is mainly used for high school sporting events and also serves as a public venue. Before the construction of nearby Bank of America Stadium in 1996, Memorial Stadium was Charlotte's largest outdoor stadium, and is still the largest municipal venue in the city. History Ground was broken on the stadium in 1934 and the gates were officially opened two years later in 1936. Named in honor of local soldiers who fell in World War I, the stadium was a project of the Works Progress Administration. Throughout the years the stadium hosted events of every kind, ranging from Presidential addresses to classic professional wrestling encounters featuring local hero Ric Flair. The stadium formerly hosted Charlotte (Central) High School (which is now Garinger). For many years afterward, as the city grew and opened more high schools, the stadium was used practically every week during the football season to accommodate both schools which had no campus stadium and large crowds which some campus stadiums could not contain for the more popular match-ups. In 1985, the stadium hosted a preseason USFL game between the Baltimore Stars and Tampa Bay Bandits in February. From 1937 to 2000, the stadium annually hosted the Shrine Bowl which was a match-up of the top high school football players in North Carolina and South Carolina. Sometime during the 1960s and 1970s, Memorial Stadium gained upper level seating on both sides of the field, raising its capacity to over 20,000. For the past few years the stadium has hosted several band competitions. It has hosted the battle of the Bands between the biggest HBCUs in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia, and hosted Drum Corps International competitions hosted by Carolina Crown. The stadium also served as a neutral site for the 2002 and 2003 meetings between The Citadel and VMI, known as the Military Classic of the South. =Recent events= In late 2009 the east end of the stadium suffered significant damage after a storm drain under the structure caved in causing the stands above it to collapse. While repairs were being made, the stadium was closed for several months. The stadium reopened in July 2010 with a reduced capacity as a grass berm largely replaced the old seating.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/08/01/1594559/memorial-stadium- ready-to-reopen.html Memorial Stadium served as the home field for the Charlotte Hounds MLL team. The team began play at the start of the 2012 season and used the stadium for home games until 2018. The team is currently on hiatus and hopes to return in 2021. The stadium continues to play a large role in Charlotte-Mecklenburg high school football, as it hosts big ticket match- ups such as Butler v. Independence and Charlotte Latin v. Charlotte Country Day. The Myers Park Mustangs moved most of their 2012 home games to the stadium after renovations temporarily lowered capacity at Gus Purcell Stadium, their on-campus home. In early 2015, the possibility arose of renovating the stadium to accommodate professional soccer in Charlotte and try to lure an MLS expansion franchise to the city, however this was only a proposal.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9257561.html Sometime during 2015, a new press box was constructed on the 'visitors' side of the stadium. The Mecklenburg County Commissioners approved a $23 million renovation plan in late 2017.http://www.wfae.org/post/county-commission- oks-32m-renovation-memorial-stadium#stream/0 =2019 Renovation= In September 2019, Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation broke ground on a $31.7 million renovation of the stadium, which will be the new home of USL Championship soccer team Charlotte Independence beginning in spring 2021. Most of the existing stadium will be demolished and re-built. The renovation will add new concourse buildings, a memorial, a new scoreboard and other amenities. Historical elements of the stadium, such as the stone wall and ticket booths, will be preserved.

It is found in the Neotropics from Tamaulipas, Mexico, through Central America, Trinidad and Tobago, and a large part of South America east of the Andes as far south as northern Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. There is one accepted record from southern Texas. It is found in a wide range of wooded habitats (even gardens and parks) in both humid and arid regions. Throughout a large part of its range, it is among the most common antbirds. Taxonomy The barred antshrike was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1764 and given the binomial name Lanius doliatus. The type locality was subsequently designated as Surinam. The specific epithet is from New Latin doliatus meaning \\"barred\\". There are 12 recognised subspecies. Description The barred antshrike is in length, and weighs . This species exhibits marked sexual dimorphism. The male of the nominate race is barred all over with black and white, and has a white-based black crest that is raised in display. The female is rufous above with a chestnut crest. The sides of her head and neck are streaked with black, and the underparts are rich buff. In both sexes, the legs are grey, the bill is black and the iris is pale yellow. The subspecies vary primarily in the overall darkness and the amount of barring and hue of the underparts. For example, in the Tobagonian race T. d. tobagensis, males are whiter below, and females darker, than in the nominate subspecies. The most distinctive subspecies is T. d. capistratus of the Caatinga in north-eastern Brazil, where males have uniform black crown (no white barring to the base) and females have streaked throat and faintly barred belly. It is also the only subspecies where the iris is deep maroon-red. It has been suggested that it should be considered a separate species, the Caatinga barred antshrike. Behavior It is typically found as territorial pairs. The female lays two purple-marked creamy white eggs in a deep cup nest in a shrub, which are incubated by both sexes for 14 days to hatching. The chicks fledge in another 12‚Äì13 days. The barred antshrike is an insectivore which feeds on ants and other arthropods at or near the ground; it sometimes follows columns of army ants, and will take small lizards and berries. It is a skulking species, which may be located by its chuckling hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hu song, often performed as a duet by a pair of birds, or a growled graaaaa.

Henri Laurent Rivi√®re (1827 - 1883) was a French naval officer and a writer who is chiefly remembered today for advancing the French conquest of Tonkin (northern Vietnam) in the 1880s. Rivi√®re's seizure of the citadel of Hanoi in April 1882 inaugurated a period of undeclared hostilities between France and Dai Nam (as Vietnam was known then) that culminated one year later in the Tonkin campaign (1883‚Äì1886). Early career Born in Paris on 12 July 1827, Rivi√®re entered the √âcole Navale in October 1842. He passed out as a midshipman (second class) in August 1845, and saw his first naval service in the Pacific Ocean on Brillante. In February 1847 he was posted to the South Seas naval division, to Virginie. He was promoted to midshipman (first class) in September 1847 and to enseigne de vaisseau in September 1849. During the next five years he served in the Mediterranean squadron aboard I√©na (1850), Labrador (1851) and Jupiter (1852‚Äì54). Significantly, his confidential reports from this period mentioned that he seemed to be unduly interested in poetry and literature. Rivi√®re took part in the Crimean campaign (1854‚Äì56), serving on the vessels Uranie, Suffren, Bourrasque and Montebello. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant de vaisseau in November 1856, he served aboard Reine Hortense during the Franco- Austrian War (1859). In 1866 he took part in the Mexican campaign aboard Rh√¥ne and Brandon. He was promoted to the rank of capitaine de fr√©gate in June 1870 and served as second officer on the ironclad corvette Th√©tis with the French Baltic Squadron during the Franco-Prussian War. He saw no active service in any of these campaigns. Rivi√®re's role in the suppression of a revolt in the French colony of New Caledonia in the late 1870s won him promotion to the coveted rank of capitaine de vaisseau in January 1880. In November 1881 Rivi√®re was posted to Saigon, as commander of the Cochin China naval division. The posting was generally regarded as a backwater that offered few opportunities for distinction. Rivi√®re himself saw it as an opportunity to write a literary masterpiece that would procure him membership of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Although Rivi√®re spent most of his adult life as a naval officer, he was also ambitious for literary distinction. He was a journalist for La Libert√©, and also had articles published in the Revue des deux mondes. Rivi√®re's intervention in Tonkin At the end of 1881 Rivi√®re was sent with a small French military force to Hanoi to investigate Vietnamese complaints against the activities of French merchants. In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, he stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882 in a few hours, with the governor Ho√†ng Di·ªáu committing suicide having sent a note of apology to the emperor. Although Rivi√®re subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force was greeted with alarm in both Vietnam and China. The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivi√®re with its own ramshackle army, enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers were to prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Black Flags had already inflicted one humiliating defeat on a French force commanded by lieutenant de vaisseau Francis Garnier in 1873. Like Rivi√®re in 1882, Garnier had exceeded his instructions and attempted to intervene militarily in northern Vietnam. Liu Yongfu had been called in by the Vietnamese government, and ended a remarkable series of French victories against the Vietnamese by defeating Garnier‚Äôs small French force beneath the walls of Hanoi. Garnier was killed in this battle, and the French government later disavowed his expedition. The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a tributary of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin. The Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882 troops of the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi armies crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying Lang Son, Bac Ninh, Hung Hoa and other towns. The French minister to China, Fr√©d√©ric Bour√©e, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December 1882 he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. The Vietnamese were not consulted by either party to these negotiations.Eastman, 57‚Äì65 Rivi√®re was disgusted at the deal cut by Bour√©e, and in early 1883 decided to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivi√®re captured the citadel of Nam Dinh with a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command.Bastard, 160‚Äì71; de Marolles, 178‚Äì92; Duboc, 97‚Äì112; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 53‚Äì4 During his absence at Nam Dinh the Black Flags and Vietnamese made an attack on Hanoi, but they were repulsed by chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers in the Battle of Gia Cuc on 28 March.Bastard, 156‚Äì60; de Marolles, 187‚Äì8; Duboc, 111‚Äì12; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 54‚Äì5 Rivi√®re was jubilant: 'This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!' Rivi√®re's timing was perfect. He had expected to be cashiered for his Capture of Nam Dinh, but instead he found himself the hero of the hour. There had recently been a change of government in France, and the new administration of Jules Ferry was strongly in favour of colonial expansion. It therefore decided to back Rivi√®re up. Ferry and his foreign minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour denounced Bour√©e's agreement with Li Hongzhang and recalled the hapless French minister. They also made it clear to the Chinese that they were determined to place Tonkin under French protection. In April 1883, realising that the Vietnamese were incapable of resisting the French effectively, the Chinese civil mandarin Tang Jingsong (Tang Jingsong, ÂîêÊôØÂ¥ß) persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against Rivi√®re with the Black Flag Army. Defeat and death Rivi√®re attempts to rescue a bogged French cannon at Paper Bridge Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier) On 10 May 1883 Liu Yongfu challenged the French to battle in a taunting message on placards that were widely distributed on the walls of Hanoi. On 19 May Rivi√®re marched out of Hanoi to attack the Black Flags. His small force (around 450 men) advanced without proper precautions, and blundered into a well-prepared Black Flag ambush at Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier), a few miles to the west of Hanoi. In the Battle of Paper Bridge the French were enveloped on both wings, and were only with difficulty able to regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Towards the end of the battle a French cannon overturned with the shock of its recoil, and Rivi√®re and his officers rushed forward to help the gunners to right it. The Black Flags fired a volley into this struggling mass of men, killing one French officer and seriously wounding Rivi√®re in the shoulder. Several seconds later, Rivi√®re collapsed. Seeing the French line in confusion, the Black Flags surged forward and drove back the French rearguard. Several French officers were wounded at this critical moment, and in the confusion of the retreat Rivi√®re's body was abandoned on the battlefield. He was immediately presumed dead by his fellow officers. If he had not already died from the effects of his wound, he would have been killed as soon as the Black Flags discovered who he was.Bastard, 171‚Äì89; de Marolles, 193‚Äì222; Duboc, 123‚Äì39; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 152‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 55‚Äì8 Although the Battle of Paper Bridge was a serious defeat for the French, it strengthened the resolve of Jules Ferry's administration to entrench the French protectorate in Tonkin. The news of Rivi√®re's defeat and death reached Paris on 26 May, and the French navy minister Admiral Peyron declared 'France will avenge her glorious children!' The Chamber of Deputies immediately voted a credit of three and a half million francs to finance the despatch of a strong expeditionary corps to Tonkin. Rivi√®re's adventure in Tonkin set in train a course of events that, within a few years, saw French rule extended beyond Cochinchina to the whole of Indochina. Posthumous honours Bust of Henri Rivi√®re, Cimeti√®re de Montmartre The French had been forced to leave Rivi√®re's body on the battlefield of Paper Bridge, and for several months were unsure of the precise circumstances of his death. After being shot in the shoulder Rivi√®re had fallen, then risen to his feet, then collapsed again. His recumbent body had been last seen surrounded by a knot of Black Flag soldiers. Most of Rivi√®re's fellow officers naturally assumed that he had been either shot or stabbed to death on the battlefield there and then, but many Vietnamese believed that he had been taken alive by the Black Flags. According to a Vietnamese soldier who claimed to have been present at the time, Rivi√®re had been brought into Liu Yongfu's presence shortly after the battle ended and had been beheaded on the orders of the Black Flag leader, one of whose close friends had been killed by the French during the battle. Neither version of his death could be confirmed. Several weeks after the battle the French heard rumours that Rivi√®re's body had been savagely mutilated and buried near the Black Flag stronghold of Phu Hoai. On 18 September 1883, acting on information received from Vietnamese informants, the French scouted the area with two battalions of marine infantry. Rivi√®re's severed head and hands, buried in a lacquered box, were discovered in the village of Kien Mai, and three weeks later the mutilated body of a European, dressed in naval uniform, was found close to Paper Bridge, near the spot where Rivi√®re had fallen on 19 May. The body had been gashed with sword slashes, the head and the hands were missing, and the sleeves of the naval tunic had been cut away to remove the marks of rank. Several French naval officers who knew Rivi√®re well were able to confirm that the body was indeed his. These circumstances strongly suggested that Rivi√®re had been killed in the heat of battle, on the battlefield of Paper Bridge. Liu Yongfu had offered a substantial bounty for the heads of French officers, graded according to their rank, and it seems likely that a Black Flag soldier had killed the wounded French commander and then decapitated him in order to claim the bounty, cutting off his hands so that his rank could be verified by the number of bands (galons) on his tunic cuffs. Rivi√®re's remains were brought back to Hanoi, where a funeral service was said over them by Paul-Fran√ßois Puginier, the French apostolic vicar of Western Tonkin. Ten years earlier Puginier had performed a similar office over the body of Francis Garnier, who had died in remarkably similar circumstances. The remains were subsequently returned to France at the request of Rivi√®re's family. They were finally buried in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre, in Paris.Duboc, 190‚Äì202 Notes References * Bastard, G., D√©fense de Bazeilles, suivi de dix ans apr√®s au Tonkin (Paris, 1884) * Duboc, E., Trente cinq mois de campagne en Chine, au Tonkin (Paris, 1899) * Eastman, L., Throne and Mandarins: China's Search for a Policy during the Sino-French Controversy (Stanford, 1984) * Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Marolles, Vice-amiral de, La derni√®re campagne du Commandant Henri Rivi√®re (Paris, 1932) * Thomazi, Histoire militaire de l‚ÄôIndochine fran√ßaise (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conqu√™te de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) External links * Biography of Henri Rivi√®re‚Äî Category:French military leaders Category:1827 births Category:1883 deaths Category:French military personnel of the Crimean War Category:French military personnel killed in action Category:People of the Tonkin campaign Category:People of French Indochina Category:People from Paris Category:Burials at Montmartre Cemetery Category:1882 in Vietnam Category:1883 in Vietnam Category:1880s in French Indochina Category:19th-century French military personnel nl:Henri Rivi√®re ","title":"Henri Rivi√®re (naval officer)"},{"id":"1913653","text":"The name Nirgal can mean: *Nergal, a god of war in the old Babylonian religion *A character in the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson *Nirgal Vallis, a placename on Mars ","title":"Nirgal"},{"id":"1913655","text":"Xitang (), formerly known as Xietang (), Pingtang () and Xutang (), is a historic town in Jiashan County, Zhejiang, China.

The town keeps a tranquil ambience and scenic beauty, making it a very popular tourist attraction. It is frequently depicted in Chinese landscape painting.About Xitang. Asiarooms. The town houses many bridges, lanes and covered corridors, with many of the old streets and lanes retaining their original features. In Xitang, the famous scene is the covered corridors which is nearly long and of simple appearance. It is actually a street with roof. Some sections of the covered corridors are placed in the busiest section, while other are built along the river of streets. Long chairs are arranged along the riverside of some covered corridors for people to have a rest. Most of them are made of bricks and wood and covered by black tiles. There are 122 lanes of varying lengths in Xitang, among which five are over a long. =Shipi Lane= The most distinctive open-air lane is called \\"Shipi Lane\\" (). It got its name for the fact that it is flanked by two residential buildings. It was built in late Ming and early Qing dynasties (1368-1911), with length and width, and the narrowest point at the entrance is only wide. It was paved with 166 stone slabs. The walls on both sides of the lane are high, and are still intact. =Zui Garden= The Zui Garden () is situated at Tawan Street of Xitang and traces its origins to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The garden, small and unique, includes a succession of five courtyards, in which delicate rockworks and winding aisles are ingeniously arranged. In the courtyard there is an exquisite tiny bridge made of bricks, which is ornamental and functional but allows only one person to pass through at a time. On the wall opposite the door are carved three Chinese characters \\"\\", from which the garden takes its name. The hall is built by Wang Zhixi (), a prominent calligrapher and painter in the Qianlong period (1735-1795) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), whose works can still be seen in the garden. Film and television Xitang locations were featured in the final sequences of the motion picture Mission: Impossible III.

Its programming schedule is determined by members of the Flywheel community, which is open for anyone to join, get trained in their operations, or to schedule an event. In spring of 1998, the Valley Arts and Music Alliance (VAMA) was founded by Cindy Bow and Helen Harrison, a grassroots collective with the aim of producing shows that reflected the artists visions rather than the values of the music industry. Throughout the rest of 1998, the group put together more than two dozen shows before finding a permanent location at 2 Holyoke Street, where it came to be known as Flywheel. The doors for Flywheels first location opened in March 1999.http://flywheelarts.org/about-flywheel/ The mission statement of Flywheel is to build community and provide artists with an environment in which creativity is valued over profit, believing that art and information should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Most of the bands that play at Flywheel are local artists, though there are occasionally performances by more well-known acts such as Kill Your Idols, Thurston Moore, and Fugazi. Not only does Flywheel showcase musicians, but they also provide a space for art openings, theater, poetry readings, performance art and film screenings. Flywheel held its last show at its old location on Holyoke Street in March 2007.

The club was founded in 1901, and lasted in some form until 1973, capturing 11 league titles during its history. From 1937 to 1942 and 1946 to 1972, the Hornets were a farm system affiliate of the original Washington Senators franchise and its post-1960 successor, the Minnesota Twins. The 1931 and 1951 Hornets were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Early history (1892, 1901‚Äì1936) The earliest \\"Charlotte Hornets\\" team was in 1892, according to Minor League Baseball records. The team played in the 19th century South Atlantic League for one season. Later in 1900, the Charlotte \\"Presbyterians\\" played a 27-game season in the North Carolina Association. Under the name Hornets, a professional baseball team played in 1901 and 1902 in the Virginia‚ÄìNorth Carolina League and the North Carolina League respectively, both Class C leagues. In 1905 the Hornets again played in the Virginia‚ÄìNorth Carolina League (then a Class D operation). In 1908, the Hornets were a founding member of the Carolina Association (Class D) through 1913. In 1909, the Hornets moved from Latta Park, to a new ballpark built by J.H. Wearn, called \\"Wearn Field\\", also called \\"Hayman Park\\" in the 1920s and 1930s, also in the 1930s it was called \\"Robbies Field\\". The Hornets moved to the North Carolina State League in 1913, another Class D League. The team remained with the North Carolina State League until 1917 when the team folded because of World War I. In 1919, the Hornets moved to the South Atlantic League (Class C 1919‚Äì1920, Class B after 1921) where they remained through the 1930 season. In 1931, the \\"Bees\\" were (Class C) playing in the Piedmont League, and from 1932 - 1935, (Class B) Piedmont League. In 1935, the Bees were the Class B, Piedmont League affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, and in 1936, the Bees left Charlotte and became the \\"Rocky Mount Red Sox\\" in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. For just one season in 1936, the Charlotte Hornets were a member of the independent Carolina League with players like \\"Alabama Pitts\\", and \\"Struttin Bud Shaney\\", who was quite a character. Affiliation with the Senators/Twins (1937‚Äì1972) The team was purchased by the Washington Senators in 1937. The club would remain affiliated with the Senators/Twins franchise for 35 years. In 1938 the team was managed by Calvin Griffith, the adopted son of Senators owner Clark Griffith. In 1940, Calvin Griffith built a 3,200-seat park in Charlotte's Dilworth neighborhood on Magnolia Avenue and named it Clark Griffith Park. It officially opened in 1941, and was the home of the Hornets for the next 31 years. The Ballpark would keep the name Griffith Park for the Charlotte Orioles inaugural season in 1976, before being renamed in 1977 as \\"Jim Crockett Memorial Park\\" or simply referred to as \\"Crockett Park\\" named after Jim Crockett, the O's owner's (Francis Crockett) husband. (Now back to the Charlotte \\"Hornets\\" history.) Following a three-year break during World War II, the Hornets returned to competition now in the Tri-State League (Class B) through the 1953 season when it rejoined the Class-A South Atlantic League. It remained in the league, which was upgraded to Class AA in 1963 and renamed the Southern League the following year, through 1972. (In 1971 the Hornets played in the Dixie Association, a merger of the Texas and Southern leagues.) In 1972, the Twins also placed a Class A Western Carolinas League franchise, the Charlotte Twins, alongside the Double-A Hornets' franchise; it lasted only one season. Through the years, the Hornets won championships in the North Carolina League (1902, 1916 and 1923), Piedmont League (1931 and 1938) Tri- State League (1946, 1947 and 1952) and Southern League (1969,1971). The mainstay of the Hornets through the years was Phillip \\"Phil\\" Howser, who became Charlotte General Manager in 1935 and except for three years in the early 1940s when he worked in the Washington Senator's front office, ran the Charlotte operation until January 1970. Sometimes he served both as president and general manager of the club. Howser worked his entire 39-year baseball career for the Griffith family, beginning in 1935 in Chattanooga. From 1971 until his death in 1974 he was southern scouting supervisor for the Twins. Howser loved youngsters and often let them into the ballpark without charge when he found them looking through holes in the fence. He prided himself on the upkeep and maintenance of Clark Griffith Park, which for years was covered with large‚Äîsix to eight foot long and four to six foot high‚Äîphotographs of old Hornet teams and players from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. In 1962 Howser was named \\"King of Baseball\\", by the National Association of Minor League Baseball and in 1969 he was named minor league baseball's executive of the year. From 1967‚Äì1969 he was named the Southern League's baseball executive of the year. In 1972 and 1973, there was plans to bring a Southern League affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds from Nashville, Tennessee and later, the International League affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds from Louisville, Kentucky to Charlotte, called the \\"Charlotte Pines\\", but unfortunately, the plans fell through, and thus failing to bring baseball back to Charlotte, for the time being. Memorable teams and players Two Hornet teams are remembered for their proficiency. The 1931 team won 100 games and lost 37 with a winning percentage of .730. The club was managed by 33-year-old player/manager Oceola Guy Lacy of Cleveland, Tenn., whose playing career spanned a quarter-century, 1916‚Äì1941. The Hornets finished 13 1/2 games ahead of the second place Raleigh, which was beaten four games to two in the championship series. The team had several .300 hitters, including Frank \\"What-A-Man\\" Packard (.366 with 21 home runs and 123 RBIs); Vern Brandes (.335 with 144 RBIs and a league high 44 stolen bases) and George Rhinehardt (.325). Jimmy Hudgens batted (.290) and was the only one of the group to play in the major leagues. The team's top pitcher was right- hander Charles \\"Struttin' Bud\\" Shaney, who led the league with a 24-10 record. Shaney never played in the majors, but won 230 games during his lengthy minor league career. In 1954 at age 54 he played in his annual Tri-State Leaguye game with the Asheville Tourists and was still good enough to pitch five innings of four-hit shutout ball for a victory. In 1951 the Hornets also won 100 games, while losing 40 with a .714 winning percentage record. The team took first place in the league on May 15 and remained there for the rest of the season, finishing 15 games ahead of Asheville. However, Charlotte was eliminated in the opening round of the league playoffs, losing three games to one to Spartanburg, which had finished 27 games behind the Hornets in regular league play. The Hornets were managed by 27-year-old Cal Ermer, who also hit. 297 and led the league's second basemen in fielding (.971) in his last season as an active player. Later he served for nearly two years (1967 and 1968) as manager of the Minnesota Twins. The Hornets' Francisco \\"Frank\\" Campos led the league in batting (.368) with only 20 strike outs in 566 plate appearances. Catcher Bob Oldis and outfield Bruce Barmes also were standouts. Oldis played parts of seven seasons in the Major Leagues as a catcher, and later was a longtime MLB coach and scout. A host of major league stars played for the Charlotte Hornets including Van Lingle Mungo (1929), Early Wynn (1939), Harmon Killebrew (1956), Tony Oliva (1962) and Graig Nettles (1967). Another player, Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, appeared as a right fielder in a single major league game on June 29, 1905, but he never had an at bat, nor a fielding play. His unusual story came to the attention of author W. P. Kinsella and was popularized by his novel Shoeless Joe and the subsequent 1988 film Field of Dreams. Graham's character was played by Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley as older and younger Graham. In 2001 as part of the 200th anniversary celebration of Minor League Baseball, Bill Weiss and Marshall Write, two veteran chroniclers of minor league teams, researched and rated the best Minor League teams of the Twentieth Century. The 1951 Charlotte Hornets ranked 36th and the 1931 Hornets 56th. History since 1976 The next era of Charlotte baseball began in 1976, however the three years prior, (1973-75) the stadium sat empty and deteriorating. In an effort to save the iconic stadium from being knocked down for warehouse space, and return baseball to Charlotte, Wrestling promoter Jim Crockett, Jr. and the Crockett family, bought the Asheville Orioles, the AA Southern League affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, and renamed them the \\"Charlotte\\" Orioles. The stadium was refurbished in time for the 1976 season. In 1977 the ballpark was renamed Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Park (more commonly known as Crockett Park), after the patriarch of the Crockett family. The team, ( known as the \\" O's \\" ), won Southern League titles in 1980 and 1984. Eventual major-league superstars Eddie Murray (the first baseman of the 1974-75 Asheville O's, then 1976 Charlotte O's) and Cal Ripken (1979-80) played for the O's during this period. On March 17, 1985, Crockett Park (mostly wood-framed) was destroyed by a massive fire after a high school baseball game. An investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was arson. (either a juvenile set flame to the park, or Jim Crockett Sr. had some wrestling debts unpaid.) The Crockett family built a 5,500-seat makeshift stadium immediately afterward, which served as the O's home for the next two seasons. After the 1987 season concluded, George Shinn, owner and founder of the NBA Charlotte Hornets, bought the team from the Crockett family. He renamed the team the Charlotte Knights out of a naming contest. The Knights played in the makeshift stadium on Magnolia for the 1988 season, with future Major League players like Curt Schilling, Gregg Olson, Steve Finley, Pete Harnisch, Jeff Tackett, and a host of other players. This however was just a temporary measure in Shinn's big plan to build a bigger ballpark, and after failed plans to construct it next to the new Hornets arena out on independence, he decided on building it in Fort Mill SC. The Knights switched the team's affiliation to the Chicago Cubs in 1989, playing at \\"Knights Castle\\" which was demolished after the season ended, as the new ballpark \\"Knights Stadium\\" opened in 1990, and would be the home of a Knights franchise for the following 23 years, but Shinn didn't stop there. What do you need in a bigger ballpark? A bigger level team, AAA level that is, so in 1992, the AA Knights franchise was sold to Nashville when the 1992 season ended and the Knights became the Nashville Express 1993-94 (Nashville TN, AA - Twins affiliate), Port City Roosters 1995-96 (Wilmington NC, AA - SL Mariners affiliate), then Mobile Bay Bears 1997-2019 (Alabama, AA - SL Diamondbacks, Mariners and Angels affiliate) and now the Rocket City Trash Pandas (Madison AL, AA - SL Angels affiliate). In 1993, Charlotte got a new AAA International League expansion franchise, which was affiliated with the Cleveland Indians from 1993‚Äì1994, the Florida Marlins from 1995‚Äì1998 and the Chicago White Sox from 1999 - Present. The team played in York County, South Carolina until 2013, when BB&T; Ballpark was built in uptown Charlotte.

The game takes place in Mexico and Central America in the 15th century. The player controls a tribe in this region, and has 100 years to prepare for a Spanish invasion by expanding their territory across the Central American map, by conquest, or by allying and trading with other tribes. Story In Theocracy, the player is the leader of the Atlan tribe (a fictional tribe), who has escaped from oppression under the Axocopans, and now must improve their tribe in order to survive in Central America. As the player's empire's borders expands, the player is able to conduct diplomacy with other tribes. The game also allows players to play through several \\"Chronicles\\", a set of objective-based missions detailing supposed heroes of Aztec history. These mostly serve for tutorial purposes rather than being a serious part of the game however. Gameplay There are two modes of playing: province view, and realm view. In province view, the player view a particular province under their control/attack. Here they assign tasks to their persons, however time stands still here, and the player must go to realm view for time to move and their actions to take effect. There is a time-scale in realm view, along with a hand-drawn map of Central America, showing all the province borders, and using colour-code to show which of the eight factions controls it. The player's tribe is represented by the colour blue, while other tribes are red, yellow, green, purple and cobalt. Provinces under control from a random tribe with no possible relations to others are paper-coloured, and provinces controlled by the Spanish (once the Spanish arrive to invade) are grey. Each tribe has a unique 'personality' dictated by its AI; the red tribe the Izhuacans for example are an 'aggressive and warlike theocracy' and will generally be the first tribe to make an aggressive move in the game. The green tribe, the Huaputecs, are more peaceful and will never attack the player unless the player has already initiated hostilities.Theocracy Adobe Game Manual Tribes also have varying military tactics and units, the Yellow Tribe has an army consisting of almost entirely sword units supported by spearmen, jaguars and nature priests, while the Cyan tribe, the Teotitlans, have enormous crossbow units known as Wonderbows and soul priests supporting their warriors. Players can also build Aztec-style pyramids to harness the power of magic from the five spheres of Magic: Sun, Star, Moon, Nature and Soul. The amount of magic available to the player is limited and measured in \\"Mana\\", Mana is used by Priests to cast spells, this Mana can be recharged by performing sacrifices at the Pyramids where priests are trained, the amount of Mana per unit depends on the Unit type. Each sphere of magic has different spells available with a vague focus on a specific type. Sun Priests specialise in attack spells, Moon in defensive ones, Nature Priests in Healing, Star Priests in 'debuff' or distraction and while Soul Priests are equally skilled in all fields. The time scale can be used to determine how fast time passes. It can be paused to make time stand still, and at slowest rate, a year passes in approximately 10 or so minutes, and at fastest rate, a year passes in approximately 20 seconds. Province View Theocracy in Province View mode Each region can be closely managed in the province view. Here activities can be undertaken such as construction, training and allocation of slaves. The majority of the population of each realm is made up of slaves, basic worker units who can undertake any task except fight and transport resources between realms. There are a certain number of new slaves born each year depending on the level of health in the province, how much food the province has and what the current population of the province is. =Food= As a bare minimum, each province must produce enough food to feed the entire population of the realm. There are two types of food, corn and meat. Corn is produced from small and large farms, and is produced faster and in greater quantity than meat, and is also required to feed llamas. Meat, while taking longer to produce, requires less slaves and is more nutritious than corn, meaning it can feed more people than the same amount of corn. It is therefore more economic to produce meat in a province than corn. Meat is also required to feed tamed jaguars. =Resources and storage= There are a number of different resources that can be used in different ways. The most basic are meat and corn, used to feed people and tamed animals. Next is wood, which every building uses in construction, and is also used to create Wonderbows (similar to ballistas). Also used in construction is stone, which is used to build more advanced buildings. Finally, there is Gold, Jade, and Jewels. Jewels are used as a currency, and to decorate the most advanced buildings. It is made out of Jade and Gold. Either one can be used to create jewels separately, but used together they produce a much greater quantity than when used separately. Corn is produced from small and large farms, meat from ranches (pig farms) and fishing huts. Wood is produced from lumberyards and stone, gold and jade are mined from quarries. Jewels are produced in a workshop from gold and/or jade. There is also mana, however it functions differently from the other resources in that it is used to cast spells, can be accessed anywhere, and is generated from temples in a small continuous trickle. Sacrificing slaves will generate much more and faster, but slaves are the only means of production so they must be sacrificed carefully so as not to ruin the economy of a region. There is a different stockpile of mana for each sphere of magic. Note: resources are stored in stockpiles in each region, thus resources for one realm can be used anywhere in that region no matter where they are stored, but must be manually transported to another region in order to be used there. The exceptions are jewels and mana. Buildings Theocracy showing an Aztec town There are a number of different buildings, which can all be broadly categorised into three main types: =Production Buildings= These buildings produce resources, but must be manned to do so. These include ranches and fishing huts, which produce meat, small and large farms, which produce corn, quarries and mines which produce stone, gold and jade and lumberyards, which produce wood. =Training Buildings= These buildings train new types of workers and warriors from slave recruits. They include schools (small, medium and large) which train workers, who speed up production of a particular resource but specialise in that resource. Small schools can train only basic workers, medium schools can train most types of workers and large schools can train any, and train them faster. Small and medium schools can only train one type of worker, but large schools can train every type, but only one at a time. Another type of training building is the barracks: small, medium and large. The small and medium barracks produce warriors from slaves, but can only produce one type of warrior. The medium barracks takes less time to train warriors than the small barracks. The large barracks can produce any of the three types of warriors, but only one at a time. They also train warriors much faster than the small or medium barracks. =Storage Buildings= These buildings store all resources except mana and jewels. There are four types, in order of size and cost to produce they are: provision stores, small stores, medium stores and large stores. =Construction= To construct a building, slaves must be sent into an unfinished building. They will build it automatically, using the resources that realm has stored. If the realm does not have enough of one or more particular resource, they will use whatever there is stored, then wait until new resources are delivered to the realm, which must be done manually. Development The development on Theocracy began when developer Philos Laboratories hired several new employees who had previous experience developing the game Perihelion: The Prophecy. It was decided that they would develop a new strategy title, with the goal of merging aspects of the games Command & Conquer and Civilization. The setting was decided by the game's graphic artists, deciding on an Aztec theme. Development continued for two years, with a planned release in spring 1999.Zsolt Vamosi of Philos Labs Interview - Eurogamer However, in March 1999 publisher Interactive Magic had decided to abandon boxed releases for their future titles, putting Theocracy in jeopardy. Philos eventually managed to buy back the publishing rights, and started updating the game to allow for a future release. These changes included redrawing most of the games graphics, switching the game resolution to 800x600, and the addition of \\"chronicles\\". The French publisher Ubisoft picked up the publishing rights, and work began on finishing the game for release.Game Over Online ~ Theocracy The game was finally released for both Windows and Linux on March 30, 2000. There was consideration towards a follow up, focusing on as then undecided new civilization and using features thought up after the original game's development entered feature freeze. Zsolt Vamosi of Philos Labs Interview - Eurogamer Reception Theocracy received mixed reviews upon its release. Its strongest praise came from Eurogamer, with one reviewer stating that the game's \\"mix of real time and turn based strategy means that Theocracy takes place on a far larger canvas than a purely real time game ever could.\\" The reviewer praised its wide scope and original ideas, separating it from many of its contemporaries.Theocracy Review - Eurogamer The British publication PC Zone was also impressed with the games originality, describing it as being \\"as refreshing as a pint of lager after a chicken vindaloo, and definitely worth shouting about.\\"PC Zone Review Other members of the press were less impressed, causing the game to only score a 72 on MobyGames.Theocracy MobyRank Reviewers criticized the game as being simple and archaic,Absolute Games (AG.ru) Review while at the same time others thought that the interface was cumbersome and the learning curve was too steep.Jeuxvideo.com Review Even though it was mostly unknown outside of Europe, the game managed to sell well enough, especially on Linux where it became a best-seller.Escape from Alcatraz Q&A; Gamespot One reviewer of the game's Linux port stated that \\"the game is a world apart from a lot of the linux games I've been playing lately. It's solid and feels nice to use - the buttons click with a satisfying sound played at the right moment, and it feels... professional.\\"Detailed Theocracy Review (Linux) (archived) The port was also plagued with negative comments however, with many complaining about installation problems and about various technical faults (such as only being able to play the game in 16 bit colours and the lack of a proper full-screen mode).Theocracy Retail Linux Client / Demo - LinuxGames Even with these problems, it still holds an average of four out of five stars at The Linux Game Tome.

It can be contrasted with geographic information systems (GIS), which are software tools. British geographer Michael Goodchild defined this area in the 1990s and summarized its core interests, including spatial analysis, visualization, and the representation of uncertainty. GIScience is conceptually related to geography, information science, computer science, but it claims the status of an independent scientific discipline. Other overlapping disciplines are: geocomputation, geoinformatics, geomatics and geovisualization. More recent related terms are geographic data science (named after data science) and geographic information science and technology (GISci&T;).  Definitions  Since its inception in the 1990s, the boundaries between GIScience and cognate disciplines are contested, and different communities might disagree on what GIScience is and what it studies. In particular, Goodchild stated that \\"information science can be defined as the systematic study according to scientific principles of the nature and properties of information. Geographic information science is the subset of information science that is about geographic information.\\" Another influential definition is that by GIScientist David Mark, which states: > Geographic Information Science (GIScience) is the basic research field that > seeks to redefine geographic concepts and their use in the context of > geographic information systems.

Traditionally, these are coastal craft or river craft used for leisure, as a utility craft and for fishing, and have a one-person or small crew. Sailing skiffs have developed into high performance competitive classes. Many of today's skiff classes are based in Australia and New Zealand in the form of , , and skiffs. The 29er, 49er, SKUD and Musto Skiff are all considered to developed from the skiff concept, all of which are sailed internationally. The term skiff is also used for a racing shell called single scull for competitive rowing, which is rowed by one rower with two oars. As opposed to sweep boats, where the rowers only have one oar each ‚Äì coxless pair, coxless four etc. Of course a lone rower must have two oars to row, so sweep oar does not exist for the skiff/single scull. Etymology The word is related to ship and has a complicated etymology: \\"skiff\\" comes from the Middle English skif, which derives from the Old French esquif, which in turn derives from the Old Italian schifo, which is itself of Germanic origin (German Schiff). \\"Ship\\" comes from the Old English \\"scip\\", which has the same Germanic predecessor. Traditional boats‚ÄîUnited Kingdom Boulter's Lock, Sunday Afternoon by Edward John Gregory shows skiffs among other craft coming out of the lock The term has been used for a number of styles of craft round the United Kingdom, often small river and sea going craft. They varied from double ended rowing boats to small sailing boats. The poet John Milton refers to a 'night foundered skiff' in Paradise Lost as early as 1670. There are references to skiffs on the River Thames (as a result of accidents) as early as 1812\\"Master John F. Hope, son of John Hope, Esq. of Harley Street, was drowned on Wednesday in the River Thames, near Eaton. He was amusing himself in a skiff near the bridge, with some other Eton Scholars...\\".

It was also used in the Lady of the Lake by Sir Walter Scott. The Thames skiff became formalised as a specific design in the early part of the 19th century. It is a round-bottom clinker-built rowing boat that is still very common on the River Thames and other rivers in England. Rowing skiffs became very popular in Victorian Britain and a skiff journey up the River Thames features in Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome,Jerome, Jerome K. Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog). Bristol: Arrowsmith, 1889 These skiffs could carry a sail and could be used for camping. Although general usage has declined, skiffs are still used for leisure and racing. During the year, skiffing regattas are held in various riverside towns in England‚Äîthe major event being the Skiff Championships Regatta at Henley. Akin to the skiff is the yoal or yole which is a clinker built boat used for fishing in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. The boat itself is a version of the Norwegian Oselvar which is similar to a skiff in appearance, while the word is cognate with \\"yawl\\". The French yole is a leisure craft similar to the Thames Skiff and is translated as \\"skiff\\", while the French skiff translates to a single scull. In Dutch and German, \\"Skiff\\" also means a single scull, while Czech skif refers to sculling boats in general. Regattas also take place across Northern Ireland with one of the largest being held in Portadown but smaller events take place throughout the year across County Down. Traditional boats‚ÄîAmericas Classic flat-bottom skiff in Maine In American usage, the term is used to apply to small sea-going fishing boats. It is referred to historically in literature in Moby-Dick by Herman MelvilleMelville, H., Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1851. xxiii, 635 pages. Published probably on November 14, 1851. and The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. Hardcover: , paperback: The skiff could be powered by sails as well as oars. One usage of skiff is to refer to a typically small flat-bottomed open boat with a pointed bow and a flat stern originally developed as an inexpensive and easy to build boat for use by inshore fishermen. Originally designed to be powered by rowing, their form has evolved so that they are efficiently powered by outboard motors. The design is still in common use today for both work and pleasure craft. They can be made of wood or other materials. There is a similar style of craft in Central America and Mexico, generally called a panga. Piracy and smuggling Captured Somalian pirates with their skiff The term skiff has been applied to motorized boats of small size and construction used as sea-going vessels for piracy or drug smuggling.Various news reports, collected on Google News. Retrieved 4 January 2011. Racing sailing boats Modern 12ft Skiff at speed The skiff with a sail has developed into specific sailing boats bearing the name \\"skiff\\". In Sydney, the term was used for a number of racing classes (sizes from 6 ft to 23 ft have existed). These were originally heavily crewed and canvassed boats that were relatively short for the canvas and crew carried and were developed from working boats of the time. This style of boat is still active in the form of Historical 10 foot and 18 foot classes. The skiff classes developed to become much lighter and faster with relatively smaller (but still very large by any other standards) rigs and smaller crews. 12ft Skiff, 13 ft Skiff, 16ft Skiff, and 18ft Skiff classes are raced in that form. With two crew on the 12 and 13 footer and three on the 16 and 18 these are still heavily crewed boats for their size. Modern developments began with the introduction of carbon fibre reinforced composite hulls, allowing for a significant reduction in weight, and an increase in rigidity. Following this, the use of carbon in masts and rigging allowed for more sail area, and better gust response. Moulded sails are being tested in both 12 ft and 16 ft skiffs, with most modern Australian 18 ft Skiffs utilising the new technology. Because the modern 18s have such a high profile, the term skiff is widely used internationally to refer to other high-performance sailing dinghy classes, mostly featuring asymmetrical spinnaker and trapeze which have been strongly influenced by modern skiffs. Examples include: Cherub Skiff, International 14, 29er, and 49er. These boats tend to be less heavily crewed in relation to their length than the traditional Australian Skiff Classes. The term is even used for some single-handed boats like the Musto Skiff which are far removed from the heavily crewed original boats. The SKUD 18 is a two-person keelboat which claims strong influence from skiff development.SKUD 18 This made its debut in the 2008 Paralympic Games. In the International Moth class the term skiff is used to distinguish designs that have an essentially vertical bow from scow designs, which have a broadly horizontal bow.

It was described as \\"HyperCard on steroids\\", combining a version of HyperCard's HyperTalk programming language with a modern object-oriented application platform. The project's goal was to allow creative designers to create complex, stand-alone applications. The main components of SK8 included the object system, the programming language, the graphics and components libraries, and the Project Builder, an integrated development environment. For much of its history, SK8 remained a research project, and inspired a number of other Apple projects like AppleScript, as well as seeing use as a prototyping platform. Although around 1993 a team was assigned by the Apple Product Division to release a SK8 runtime, the limitation of the Mac's capabilities as well as the shift to the PowerPC chip made such a large project intractable. With the bulk of the original vision completed and no easy path to release as part of MacOS, active development ended in 1996‚Äì1997, and the Macintosh Common Lisp source code for the entire project was released to the public in 1997.  History  The SK8 project was created by Ruben Kleiman when he joined Apple in 1987. He had come to Apple to develop a flexible, object-oriented user interface and multimedia development environment. The name of the project derived from his interest in skateboarding.The application splash screen prominently features a skateboard. Coincidentally, at this time the HyperCard, with its direct manipulation interface and scripting language, was about to ship. While HyperCard was great for simple applications it used a limited interaction model ‚Äì the \\"stacks\\" of cards\\" ‚Äì that limited its potential applicability. SK8 attempted to extend these benefits to a wider programming role. Early work on what would become SK8 focused on infrastructure rather than visual programming. Kleiman's first effort was a dynamic, prototype-based object system, MacFrames, a frame/object system with plug-ins for inference engines. Through preferences settings, MacFrames was used to emulate a large variety of object systems, including IntelliCorp's KEE. This research, in concert with users developing actual applications and prototypes at Apple, yielded the object model used in SK8. MacFrames was developed in Coral Lisp, which was acquired by Apple and became Macintosh Common Lisp. The Macintosh at that time had no generalized inter- process communication (IPC) system. Kleiman created an IPC init for the Mac to allow MacFrames to communicate with other processes, in particular, HyperCard. This allowed HyperCard to be used as a visual programming front-end for MacFrames. Another goal of MacFrames was to build distributed processing right into the object system. Instead of using an RPC API, one simply set the object's property with the desired value and callback for the results. MacFrames was used by Apple's QA group to create an automated black-box testing system. The SK8 Project Builder was created to provide a rich set of direct manipulation tools, including tools for building interactive controls and general but non-invasive glueing. The builder's objective was to provide a visual/direct manipulation interface for building visual development environments. That is, the system could be used to develop completely different development environments tailored to different tasks. The first version of the SK8 graphics system was designed to extend HyperCard, allowing cards to have multiple layers rather than a single \\"background\\" template. The SK8 system was initially programmed in Lisp. This was considered too arcane for general use. Additionally, there was growing concern about the number of different languages in use at Apple. As part of a wider effort to modernize the MacOS, a new unified scripting language was desired. In 1989 Kleiman joined David Canfield Smith and Larry Tesler to design and implement the first version of AppleScript. This version of AppleScript used SK8 objects, and two later the Apple Product Division re-implemented AppleScript using AppleEvents as the glue for communicating with AppleScript objects. The original prototype was then renamed SK8Script, and was itself re-implemented in assembler in 1992. A number of researchers in the Advanced Technology Group began to use SK8 for their projects. Certain universities and corporations also began to participate. The system was used to develop prototypes for Newton, QuickTime interfaces, interprocess communication, and was used to prototype many titles, including Stagecraft, a learning tool for children. For performance reasons, in 1992 and 1993 SK8 was re-implemented from the ground up. Working at Apple's Cambridge Research Center, the Macintosh Common Lisp object store was isolated and directly hooked into SK8's store. The SK8Script debugger was re- implemented at the assembler language level (previously in Lisp) and the compiler and runtime performance improved.  Description  The SK8 system includes the object system, the graphics and component objects, the SK8Script language, and the Project Builder environment. =Object System= The SK8 object system was, like JavaScript, prototype-based, but unlike JavaScript, object properties were themselves objects. Hence, properties were not simply names that acted as keys to set or retrieve values, but in addition possessed arbitrary behavior. This allowed properties to have intelligent behavior (e.g., trigger an inference engine or serve as endpoints in RPC networking); one could think of them as \\"smart properties\\". The idea was to allow application programmers to focus on the manipulating objects rather than having to learn APIs‚Äîwhich would be built into the objects. Not implemented was a hierarchical namespace managing property names. =SK8Script= Until 1989, SK8's scripting language was Lisp. This changed to SK8Script, which was heavily influenced by HyperTalk (HT). Many of the differences between SK8Script and HyperTalk can be considered to be generalization of HT concepts, removing tight integration with particular objects in the HyperCard universe and replacing them with generalized syntax that could interact with any object. Like HT, a core concept of the SK8Script system are the \\"containers\\", which roughly equate to objects in conventional systems, and the \\"chunking\\" system that allowed those containers to be identified and enumerated. HT had introduced the idea of offering multiple ways to address objects and collections, allowing the programmer to select whatever syntax seemed most natural in context, and then use an entirely different syntax somewhere else. SK8Script offered a similar system. =Graphics and Component Objects= SK8's universe was made up of a multimedia-oriented system using Actors on a Stage. Actors were any objects that were based on the prototype Actor object, which contained the basic framework needed to provide 2D graphics support - the location and size of the object for instance. Actors became visible when they were placed upon the Stage, an invisible background object that captured user events to provide interactivity. In SK8, a traditional window was an object like any other graphics object. When an Actor was on the Stage, it could behave as a window-like object. It was easy to design complex objects that behaved like windows (e.g., a donut-shaped window; its hole's opacity 0%, with content being a text object scrolling around or perhaps a movie playing within its frame). An object known as the \\"halo\\" provided resize handles and other widgets for manipulation in a visual development environment. All SK8 Actors could contain other actors. The hierarchy could be navigated using the chunking expressions, so one could \`set the visible of the first Rectangle in CoolOval to true\`. The objects could then be made visible in the UI by moving them onto the Stage using the \`insert\` command, like \`insert CoolOval into the stage\`, which would make both the oval and rectangle appear. GUIs were constructed solely from Actors. A window-like object could be built out of an opaque rectangle containing other objects (e.g., close buttons, widgets). Every Actor's drawing style was controlled by a Renderer, which aided the GUI building process. For instance, the BevelRenderer could be used to bevel the edges around an Actor, producing an effect like Windows 3.x controls or the title bar in NeXTSTEP. Other renderers included color and image fills, gradients, tiles and blends. Although there was no difference in programming terms, basic objects like rectangles were classified as \\"geometry actors\\" while more traditional GUI elements like buttons were known as \\"interface actors\\". The Stage captured user-generated events like mouse-down clicks and key presses and sent them to the Actors. The visual hierarchy determined which object would receive the message first - the Stage was Z-ordered and objects closer to the front got the messages first. Messages could be passed up the class/prototype hierarchy with the \`do inherited\` command. =Project Builder= SK8's Project Builder used custom windows and widgets, and did not look like any other IDE. Project Builder was an environment for building visual development environments. It provided code editing, debugging, graphics and smart component library, runtime targeting support and a direct manipulation graphical interface builder system. A key element of the Builder system was the \\"Overviewer\\" panel, which held a categorized list of all of the objects in the currently opened project. These include libraries, user-created functions and methods, variables, and so forth. These could be examined and edited by double-clicking on them, or by clicking in an associated pop-up menu that appeared on the object when it was selected in the GUI builder. The Object Editor that appeared listed the object's \\"properties\\" (instance and class variables) in one pane, and it's \\"handlers\\" (methods) in another. The GUI builder included a drag-and-drop based system for constructing visual objects. SK8 did not have traditional \\"screens\\"; it used an invisible \\"Stage\\" object that served as the background for managing events and visual objects. One interesting aspect was that no windows, in the traditional sense, were needed or expected to display anything. In fact, any visual object could have window-like behavior (through its drag-and-drop and other smart properties). SK8 did, however, include a system for editing and programming complete menu bars, a feature that HyperCard lacked. Another oft-requested feature from HyperCard was a media editor, which allowed Macintosh resources to be moved in and out of the project. SK8 built this functionality into the IDE. Other components of the system included an online documentation system, lists of systemwide objects and commands, and the code editor and debugger windows. =Interacting with the System= SK8Script offered a system for calling in and out of operating system functions, allowing it to more directly interact with the Macintosh Toolbox. In HyperCard, interacting with arbitrary Toolbox code was handled through custom code resources known as XCMDs and XFCNs which encapsulated the functionality in a black box. These were called and returned in a single operation, with the internal operations invisible. Under SK8, SK8Script could interact directly with the encapsulated code, setting variables, calling functions and returning results. External code could also call into SK8Script, examining and setting variables, or calling functions.

The counties of Devon and Dorset front onto the bay. Geology Golden Cap across Lyme Bay from Lyme Regis. The area around Lyme Bay is part of a World Heritage Site, the Dorset and East Devon Coast, which is also known as the Jurassic Coast, named for its Jurassic geology. History Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were in the area surrounding Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Notable among these were the discoveries made by self-educated palaeontologist and fossil collector Mary Anning, in the 1820s. The weather in the bay is temperate by English standards, and far more temperate than many other places at a similar latitude. The reason for this is the warming action of the Gulf Stream. The area along the coast of Lyme Bay is thus a popular holiday destination. On 22 March 1993, four schoolchildren died in what is known as the Lyme Bay kayaking tragedy.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the- school-canoe-tragedy-canoe-instructors-were-not-qualified-teachers-no- official-checks-on-centres-1499567.html Lyme Bay was the site of Exercise Tiger, a practice run for the D-Day invasion of France in 1944, using the beach called Slapton Sands near Slapton, Devon as the practice landing area. The operation went horribly wrong when German E-boats appeared on the scene and attacked the landing craft, killing 749 American Army and Navy personnel in the middle of the bay. A ship commissioned in 2007 for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary carries the name of the area, RFA Lyme Bay.https://www.fleetmon.com/vessels/rfa-lyme-bay_9240768_30095/?language=en  Underwater  Much of Lyme bay is not visually spectacular, there are few dramatic underwater rock cliffs painted with a riot of colour; nor is it beautiful clear water offering panoramic vistas across the seabed. The reefs in Lyme bay are mostly low lying and the waters tend to be fairly gloomy and turbid. As this is essentially a large, open, sandy bay exposed to the prevailing winds, then significant amounts of suspended sediment (at least near-shore, close to the seabed) are the norm. Whilst winds may ease in summer, it is also prone to strong plankton blooms during May and June, with a second less pronounced bloom in late summer. Thus underwater visibility rarely exceeds 10 metres (30ft) and frequently may be less than 3 metres (10ft). The reefs in the bay, though numerous in the centre and east, are mostly discontinuous, forming a patchwork of low rocky outcrops surrounded by sediment. This means that they tend to be covered by thin veneers of sediment as tide and wave action lifts and sweeps saltating sand across them. The amount of sand will vary, depending on the size of the reef area, how high the reef rises above the surrounding sediment plain, the strength of tidal streams in that part of the bay and how strong the wind has been recently (and thus how big the waves). The flip side of this is that the marine life communities on these reefs tend to be rather different from those inhabiting areas with perhaps more visually spectacular ‚Äòclean‚Äô reefs further west. Wildlife Tank wrecks from the D-Day practice provide a venue for diving. Marine life includes the Devon cup coral (Caryophyllia smithii)ARKive and pink sea fan (Eunicella verrucosa) .ARKive The pink seafan is a nationally protected species that occurs in very high densities on some of the limestone reefs in Lyme Bay. Reefs in the Eastern part of Lyme Bay support a population of sunset corals (Leptopsammia pruvoti). Sunset corals are one of the very few species of true corals (i.e. stony, or scleractinian, corals found in British waters. Sunset corals are rare in British waters, known to occur at only a handful of locations. The Lyme Bay supports one of the densest populations found around the UK and also the easternmost population known in UK waters . The reefs have been under threat from scallop dredging which, if unregulated, might destroy the coral's habitat. Devon Wildlife Trust has been campaigning to protect the reefs, calling for an end to the dredging and trawling within a zone to help the reefs recover. About 20% of this area is now protected by a voluntary agreement made between the DEFRA and the fishermen of the South West Inshore Fishermen's Association.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/02/fishing-limit- lyme-bay-catches Settlements Golden Cap and East Devon from Burton Bradstock. * Axmouth * Beer * Branscombe * Charlestown, Dorset * Dawlish Warren * Teignmouth * Exmouth * Fortuneswell -and the Isle of Portland * Budleigh Salterton * Eype * Charmouth * Lyme Regis * Otterton * Seaton * Sidmouth * West Bay Rivers Rivers that flow into Lyme Bay include the Exe, Otter, Teign, Sid and Axe in Devon, and the Lim, Char, Brit and Bride in Dorset.http://wrt.org.uk/project/rivers-lim-axe/ References External links * Devon Wildlife Trusts page about the Lyme Bay coral reefs * Save Lyme Bay Reefs Category:Bays of Devon Category:Bays of Dorset Category:Jurassic Coast Category:Lyme Regis Category:Natural regions of England ","title":"Lyme Bay"},{"id":"1913775","text":"Rock-a-Doodle is a 1991 live-action/animated musical comedy produced by Sullivan Bluth Studios and Goldcrest Films. Loosely based on Edmond Rostand's 1910 comedy play Chantecler, Rock-a-Doodle was directed by Don Bluth and written by David N. Weiss. The film features the voices of Glen Campbell, Christopher Plummer, Phil Harris (in his final film role before his retirement from acting, and his death in 1995), Charles Nelson Reilly, Sorrell Booke, Sandy Duncan, Eddie Deezen, Ellen Greene, and Toby Scott Ganger (in his film debut). The film was released in the United Kingdom on 2 August 1991 and in the United States and Canada on 3 April 1992. The film tells the story of an anthropomorphic rooster named Chanticleer, who lives on a farm and crows every morning to raise the sun. However, he leaves his farm to become a rock star in the city after being tricked by the Grand Duke of Owls, whose kind hates sunshine, into thinking that his crow does not actually raise the sun. Without Chanticleer, rain continues to pour non-stop, causing a massive flood all over the country. The Duke and his henchmen take over in the darkness, and plan to eat all of the barnyard animals. Chanticleer's friends from the farm, along with Edmond, a young human boy who was transformed into a kitten by the Duke, take off on a mission to get Chanticleer to bring back the sun and save the country before it is too late.  Plot  One morning, Chanticleer, a rooster whose singing seems to raise the sun every morning, gets into a fight with a stranger sent by the Grand Duke of Owls, whose kind hates sunlight. Chanticleer defeats his attacker, but forgets to crow, and the sun rises anyway. Ridiculed and rejected by the other animals, Chanticleer leaves the farm in shame, and the sun goes back down as Chanticleer had not crowed. Afterwards, perpetual darkness and rainfall threaten the farm with flooding. This story turns out to be a fairy tale being read to a young boy named Edmond by his mother. Their family's farm is in danger of being destroyed in a storm, and when his mother leaves to assist the rest of the family, Edmond calls for Chanticleer's return. He is instead greeted by the Duke, who is angered by Edmond's interference and uses his magical breath to transform Edmond into a kitten with the intent to devour him. Edmond is saved by Patou, a basset hound from Chanticleer's farm, and Edmond manages to drive away the Duke with a flashlight. Edmond then meets several other animals from the farm, all of whom are hoping to find Chanticleer and apologize to him for their behavior. Edmond accompanies Patou, a cowardly magpie named Snipes, and the intellectual field mouse, Peepers, to the city, while the rest of the animals remain at Edmond's house. Hunch, the Duke's pygmy nephew, is assigned by him to stop Edmond and the others from finding Chanticleer. The group narrowly escapes him and enters the city through an aqueduct pipe. Chanticleer, now under the name of \\"The King\\", has become a famous Elvis impersonator under his manager Pinky Fox, who is employed by the Duke to keep Chanticleer in the city and prevent his friends from finding him. During a concert, he is introduced to Goldie Pheasant as a distraction in case Chanticleer's friends come to find him. Goldie soon grows genuinely attracted to Chanticleer, and realizes Pinky's true intentions when he captures Edmond and the others trying to get a letter to Chanticleer. Meanwhile, the Duke and his party stalk the farm animals at Edmond's house, who continually use Edmond's flashlight to drive them off as long as the batteries hold out. Realizing that she is in love with him, Goldie confesses to Chanticleer that his friends had come to see him, and Pinky blackmails Chanticleer to attend his show or never see his friends again. Hunch inadvertently frees Edmond and the others, and they help Chanticleer and Goldie make a grand escape in a helicopter, which they use to return to the farm. After their batteries run out, the denizens of the farm are nearly made a meal of by the Duke and his minions when they are driven off by the helicopter's spotlight. Edmond and the others try to get Chanticleer to crow, but his ongoing sense of dejection limits his ability. The Duke taunts Chanticleer and tries to drown him, but Edmond starts chanting Chanticleer's name in hopes of reviving his spirit, provoking the Duke into strangling Edmond until he loses consciousness. Impressed by Edmond's bravery, the other animals begin chanting Chanticleer's name, driving an angry Duke to transform himself into a tornado. Chanticleer finally regains his confidence and crows loud enough to raise the sun, diminishing the Duke into a harmless miniature version of himself. He is then chased away by a vengeful Hunch into the distance once and for all. The floods begin to subside and Edmond transforms back into a human. Edmond awakes in the real world, where the sun is shining outside and the floods have ended, but Edmond's mother assumes that his adventures were only a dream. Nevertheless, Edmond picks up Chanticleer's book and thanks him for coming back, before he is magically transported into Chanticleer's world, where he witnesses the rooster singing to make the sun shine.  Cast  * Toby Scott Ganger as Edmond, the son of a human farmer who is being read the story of Chanticleer by his mother, Dory. He is transformed into a kitten by the Grand Duke after trying to summon back Chanticleer, and is the one who organises the farm animals to bring Chanticleer back to the farm after the flooding starts. He slowly begins to learn the errors of his ways and stops being afraid, This is Ganger's first acting role. * Glen Campbell as Chanticleer, a rooster who lives on a farm with many other animals, who are fond of and love him. When the sun rises without his crowing, his friends, believing he was lying to them about his crowing bringing up the sun (a fact he himself thought was true), reject him, leading to the adventures of Edmond and the others. In a miserable state, he goes to the city and becomes a popular singer. Through his manager Pinky, he meets Goldie and falls in love at first sight with her. Soon though, his friends come to the city and apologize. He and Goldie are then brought back to the farm, so he can save it. He is based on the late superstar Elvis Presley. * Phil Harris as Patou, a Basset Hound who is a good friend to both Chanticleer and Edmond, and plays the narrator character of the story. He despises the Grand Duke and is dedicated to Edmond's cause to bring Chanticleer back home. He is brave and reasonable, but somewhat temperamental. His endeavour to find Chanticleer is hampered by the fact that he does not know how to tie his shoes (which he wears because of bunions, in which it is a running gag). However, in the end, he finally figures out how to tie them right, after Edmond teaches him, This was Harris's final acting role; he retired after its release. * Christopher Plummer as the Grand Duke of Owls, a magical owl who despises Chanticleer. He overhears Edmond's call for Chanticleer in the real world and transforms him into a kitten, planning to eat him as a punishment. Unfortunately, his sentence for Edmond has been interrupted by Patou. The Duke hates his nephew Hunch and threatens several times to kill him if he fails to annihilate Chanticleer's friends. The Duke is a malevolent powerful creature of the night, with a penchant for eating smaller animals as meals and commanding other villainous owls to do his bidding. He hates sunlight, like all owls, and recoils when light shines on him. Also, he possesses magical breath that can transform anyone into any creature, as exampled when he turns Edmond into his kitten form. He manages to kill Edmond by strangling him to death. He is chased away by Hunch near the very end of the film after being shrunken to a size smaller than that of Hunch and the mice and chicks on the farm, driving the both of them far away from Chanticleer's farm. In a deleted scene of the film, he nearly eats a skunk that he has stuffed (live) into a pie, but thanks to Hunch's clumsiness, the skunk escapes. In the final version of that scene, however, it is unknown what kind of pie the Duke is baking. * Ellen Greene as Goldie, a pheasant and singer who is in Pinky's employment. She is initially jealous of Chanticleer for stealing her spotlight, but falls in love with him upon becoming more acquainted with him. Pinky initially tells her that Edmond is a bad kitty, but when Pinky has Edmond and his friends tied up, she realizes that they are actually Chanticleer's friends, and tells Chanticleer that they tried to get a message to him. After this, Chanticleer manages to escape the set of Pinky's new movie, and returns to the farm with his friends, Edmond, and Goldie. Goldie stays with Chanticleer on the farm, and they presumably get married at the end. * Eddie Deezen as Snipes, a magpie. He, Edmond, Patou, and Peepers travel to the city in a toybox floating on the floodwaters, with Snipes more interested in exploring the city and its sights than actually helping his friends. Being claustrophobic, this poses a problem when he pokes holes in the box trying to escape and reach open air. He despises garbage and dirt, but loves the food served in the city when they go inside a restaurant where Chanticleer sings, particularly lasagna. * Sandy Duncan as Peepers, a mouse. Because of this, she is initially terrified of Edmond, but he tries to convince everyone that he used to be a boy. She was willing to accept him for being a cat if he took her and the others to the city. It is not until the very end of the film that she believes him and comments \\"oh, he was a handsome little boy...\\" She has a lisp and very round glasses, and is constantly arguing with Snipes's chauvinistic views. * Charles Nelson Reilly as Hunch, the Duke's pygmy nephew and lead henchman. Hunch enjoys rhyming words with \\"aggravation\\" and humming \\"The Ride of the Valkyries\\". He is dimwitted, but extremely aggressive. He carries an all- purpose Swiss Army Knife in a lidless soda can strapped to his back and uses its various bladed objects, tools, and household objects (such as a flyswatter) as weapons. A small running gag in the film was that whenever the Duke would breathe on him, his magic would transform Hunch into a randomly different creature. In the end, Hunch gets the upper hand, and chases his abusive uncle away with his flyswatter. * Sorrell Booke as Pinky, a Southern fox who loves money and golf. He is also Chanticleer's manager in the city. His job is to ensure that Chanticleer never feels the compulsion to return home by convincing him that his friends hate him, making it easy to profit off of Chanticleer's singing skills. He secretly works for the Duke and lies to Goldie about Edmond being a \\"bad kitty\\". Chanticleer and Goldie, who have fallen in love with each other, escape with Edmond's friends, foiling Pinky's plans and destroying his limousine simultaneously. This was Booke's final film role. * Will Ryan as Stuey, a chronically nervous pig from Chanticleer's farm. Whenever anyone mentions the owls, he starts to freak out, and will sometimes snort and whimper. While Edmond, Snipes, Patou, and Peepers go to the city to return Chanticleer to the farm, he stays behind to keep the owls at bay. He is almost eaten by the Duke, but is saved when the group returns with Chanticleer, shining a helicopter light on the Duke. * Louise Chamis as Minnie, a rabbit from the farm. * Bob Gallico as Radio Announcer * Jake Steinfeld as Farmyard Bully, a chickenhawk and minion of the Duke sent by him to stop Chanticleer from crowing. Steinfeld also voiced Max the Bouncer, a bouncer frog who is one of Pinky's henchman. * T.J. Kuenster, Jim Doherty, John Drummond, and Frank Kelly as the Duke's owl henchmen. * Kathryn Holcomb as Dory, Edmond's mother * Stan Ivar as Frank, Edmond's father * Christian Hoff as Scott, one of Edmond's older brothers * Jason Marin as Mark, one of Edmond's older brothers  Production  = Development = Plans for an animated version of the Chanticleer tale dated as far back as the early years of the Walt Disney Studios, where several of its artists were interested in combining elements of the story with those about an anthropomorphic fox named Reynard. Though character designs by Marc Davis survive, Walt Disney personally rejected the pitch, and the film was never put into production or animation tests. Don Bluth began pre-production of an animated film about Chanticleer in 1982. In 1985, the film was mentioned as being in development limbo. In the late 1980s, as a response to the success of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the proposal was revised by a former Disney animator, Don Bluth, who wanted to tell the rooster's story through live action and animation. Originally, the story's first and last scenes were to be shot in black and white, similar to 1939's The Wizard of Oz. The film's opening, which took place at a farm, had Edmond's mother reading the tale of Chanticleer to him. Victor French from Get Smart and Highway to Heaven was set to direct these scenes, but terminal lung cancer forced him out of production. Bluth, who had never done anything in this field, took over from this point. However, very little of this footage made it in the final cut. The live-action sequences were done at Ardmore Studios. In a 1990 magazine article, Don described the plot of the film thusly. \\"ROCK-A-DOODLE is a fantasy, something that we just made up. It's about a character named Chanticleer who thinks that when he crows the sun comes up. The truth is, it does; until one day into the farm yard comes another rooster who fights with Chanticleer and keeps him so busy that the sun, who has a habit of coming up every morning at that time, peeks its little head over the hill. Well, Chanticleer has not crowed and when he sees that the sun has come up without him, he's devastated. All the farm yard animals ridicule and laugh at him, so he walks away and says 'I'm nobody.' The sun becomes very upset after that and hides behind the clouds never to come out again. Meanwhile, the rooster goes away to the city and becomes a rock star, very reminiscent of Elvis Presley. The farm yard animals realize they're in trouble because the rains have come, the world's flooding, and there's no more sunshine. So they go to the city and try to bring Chanticleer home to crow.\\" In the final film, however, it is never explained why the sun rises even though Chanticleer does not crow, despite how much the narration of the film tries to explain many things. = Filming = The live-action footage was filmed in 1990 at MGM Studios in Hollywood, California. When the live-action footage was finished during production, Goldcrest Films recruited Sullivan Bluth Studios to animate the rest of the film. Animation took place in both Burbank, California and Dublin, Ireland. Chanticleer's girlfriend, Goldie the Pheasant, was designed to have attributes similar to Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (as seen in the original trailer). In response to reactions from mothers during test screenings of her scenes, Goldcrest requested that Sullivan Bluth reanimate the scenes by covering her chest with feathers as cel overlays, or simply painting her cleavage out. = Aspect ratio = The live-action and animation sequences were filmed in two separate aspect ratios. The animation was shot on an open-matte full-screen negative, meaning the top and bottom of the image was cropped to fit the theatre screen along with the new Olive Films DVD and Blu-ray releases. However, the live- action scenes, including all animated elements, were shot in hard-matted widescreen. When viewed in full-screen (except the theatre screen and the new Olive Films DVD and Blu-ray releases), all the animated sequences (except for parts of the finale) can be seen in full, but the live-action segments lose information on the sides. = Post-production = To avoid a potential PG rating, Bluth edited out the showing of The Duke's \\"skunk pie\\" (the pie is not seen in full view in the final version), the animators had to replace Chanticleer's glass of wine with a transparent cup of soda in the \\"Kiss and Coo\\" sequence, and had to draw colored effects into The Grand Duke's breath to make him less scary for young audiences. Test audiences also felt confused by the storytelling so the filmmakers decided to include narration told by the dog character, Patou, voiced by Phil Harris. The crew, because of these changes, had to work overtime to finish the film by Thanksgiving 1990.The copyright date of 1990 appears in the film's end credits, although it was not released until at least a year later.  Release  Rock-a-Doodle was originally going to be released by MGM‚ÄìPathe Communications Co., but studio partnership was facing financial difficulties, so Bluth rescheduled Rock-a- Doodle for release around Thanksgiving 1991 and selected The Samuel Goldwyn Company as the film's distributor. However, that date was further moved to April 1992 to avoid competition with Walt Disney Pictures and Walt Disney Feature Animation's Beauty and the Beast, as well as Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment's An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, a sequel to An American Tail, in which Bluth himself was not involved. Prior to the North American theatrical release, a sneak preview of the film was included on the 1990 VHS release of All Dogs Go to Heaven. Rock-a-Doodle was the first feature-length family live-action/animated film since 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but unlike the live-action characters from that film sharing the screen with animated characters like Roger Rabbit, Edmond is the only live- action character to share the screen with the animated farm animals; this was at the beginning, when The Grand Duke confronts Edmond before turning him into an animated cat, and at the end, where Chanticleer is singing a reprise of Sun Do Shine like he does at the beginning. Bluth chose this direction because he was influenced by Roger Rabbit. = Home media history = Rock-a-Doodle was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on 18 August 1992, as well as on DVD on 20 July 1999 by HBO Video. The first VHS release includes a sneak peek at Don Bluth's next animated feature, Thumbelina, showing a scene where Thumbelina (voiced by Jodi Benson who previously voiced Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid) meets Prince Cornelius (voiced by Gary Imhoff) from the Vale of the Fairies and falls in love with him. It also includes a promotional commercial for Wisk laundry detergent, which has a $5.00 mail-in rebate certificate found inside each videocassette. A second edition was released by MGM Home Entertainment through Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on 8 November 2005. In 2010, the film was released along with The Pebble and the Penguin as a double- sided DVD. For the film's 25th anniversary of its North American release, a third edition was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Olive Films (under license from MGM) on 31 October 2017. That edition marked the film's first widescreen debut in an American home media release (which was the final Don Bluth film to be presented in the widescreen format in an American home media release), apart from digital retailers. However, unlike the previous home media releases, both the new Olive Films DVD and Blu-ray releases were sourced from PAL masters (resulting in a slightly higher audio pitch than normal, despite the running time remaining the same as its NTSC counterpart), although both the 2012 MGM logo and the last half of the end credits were kept in a normal pitch. Despite that, the entire film remains normal-pitched on Vudu (due to still using the mid-2000s printing).  Reception  = Box office = The film took in $11,657,385 at the US box office after an opening weekend gross of $2,603,286, which forced Bluth's studio into liquidation half a year after its release. Moreover, a Hong Kong company, Media Assets, purchased Bluth's next three films, Thumbelina, A Troll in Central Park, and The Pebble and the Penguin. None of these did any better than Rock-a-Doodle critically or commercially, except Thumbelina, which did get slightly better in critical reception. All of them preceded 1997's Anastasia, his comeback hit. = Critical reception = Rock-a-Doodle received generally negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 20% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 15 reviews with an average score of 4/10. In a positive review, the Washington Post wrote \\"The young ones, who certainly don't give a sticky- fingered hoot about animation production values, are likely to have a good time with this. There are many passing delights. Composer T. J. Kuenster has some funny songs. They're not Ashman and Menken (The Little Mermaid songwriting team), but they're sprightly. The best is probably a Bach-like fugue number, in which the Grand Duke and his owlish goons sing \\"Never Let Him Crow\\" around a church organ. But in a movie like this, it ain't over till the rooster sings.\\" Empire found it more compelling than Bluth's previous effort All Dogs Go to Heaven, labeling Chanticleer as \\"good-natured kitsch,\\" its \\"successful if unspectacular\\" live-action/animation mixture, and the use of the real-life Jordanaires as backing vocalists. Halliwell's Film Guide commended its \\"excellent animation\\", but complained of the \\"poor and confusing narrative\\" that \\"rendered [it] pointless\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film two stars out of four. In his review, he gave mild praise to the songs and the animation and said the film may entertain younger audiences, but said the film \\"doesn't feel as bright as it should.\\" He also called the live-action segments unnecessary. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune criticized the film's overwhelming amount of characters and subplots as well as its \\"frantic\\" altering in pacing and tone. However, he acclaimed the hand- drawn animation, calling it superior to the \\"shabby rotoscoping techniques\\" of Beauty and the Beast (1991). Hartford Courant reviewer Malcolm L. Johnson, while feeling that Rock-a-Doodle lacked a story, highlighted its \\"technical feats\\" in animation, such as the use of live-action and moments where the animation \\"zoomps] us through layers of action, as though a camera were riding on the back of a freewheeling bird.\\" He also praised the voice acting and \\"witty\\" take of the \\"Bach vs. rock\\" story. Charles Soloman, a critic for the Los Angeles Times disliked the film's writing, reasoning that it was filled with plot holes, forced \\"fun\\" elements, and rejection of the source material's \\"powerful message about the importance of self-knowledge.\\" He also criticized its cheap-looking special effects: \\"The Grand Duke‚Äôs magic breath sprays twinkling stars and crescent moons that look like the glitter sold by the scoop in card shops. The matte lines are clearly visible in the final live- action/animation scenes, and a weird glow suffuses the entire sequence, as if it had been shot at Chernobyl.\\" Entertainment Weekly panned Rock-a-Doodle's \\"limp rock homages,\\" forgettable song, \\"washed-out\\" colors, and the \\"cheap\\" look of the live-actions sequences. In 2011, Total Film ranked it as 24th among the 50 worst children's films ever made.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack for Rock-a-Doodle was composed by Robert Folk and performed by the Irish Film Orchestra, with songs written and produced by T.J. Kuenster, one of the songwriters for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Background vocals on \\"We Hate the Sun\\", \\"Tweedle Te Dee\\", and \\"The Owls' Picnic\\" were all sung by a triple-tracked Kuenster himself. The tracks \\"Sun Do Shine\\", \\"Come Back to You\\", \\"Rock-a- Doodle\\", \\"Treasure Hunting Fever\\", \\"Sink or Swim,\\" \\"Kiss 'n Coo\\", and \\"Tyin' Your Shoes\\" contained background vocals by The Jordanaires. = Track listing = # \\"Sun Do Shine\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell # \\"We Hate the Sun\\" ‚Äì Christopher Plummer # \\"Come Back to You\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell # \\"Rock-a-Doodle\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell # \\"Bouncers Theme Song\\" ‚Äì The Don Bluth Players # \\"No Batteries!\\" (Tweedle-Le- Dee) ‚Äì Christopher Plummer # \\"Treasure Hunting Fever\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell # \\"Sink or Swim\\" ‚Äì Ellen Greene # \\"Kiss 'n Coo\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell and Ellen Greene # \\"Back to the Country\\" ‚Äì Glen Campbell # \\"The Owls' Picnic\\" ‚Äì Christopher Plummer # \\"Tyin' Your Shoes\\" ‚Äì Phil Harris and Toby Scott Ganger  Merchandise  A novelization of the film, written by Don Bluth and Chip Lovitt, was published by Troll Communications LLC ().

It is situated approximately to the northeast of Chester, between Helsby and Ellesmere Port, near to the River Mersey. Its proximity to the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal have contributed to its industrial character. The village is on the north-western edge of the Cheshire plain, approximately from Stanlow Refinery, a Shell facility and the seventh largest oil refinery in Europe. The refinery produces one-sixth of the United Kingdom's petrol. At the time of the 2001 Census, the village of Elton had a population of 3,528,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish headcounts : Chester Retrieved 2009-12-15 increasing to 3,586 at the 2011 Census. Elton was briefly in the media spotlight in 1997 when one of its residents, Louise Woodward, went on trial for murder in the USA. By 2007, 65 hectares of the former Ince Power Station site near the Mersey had been redeveloped as part of a large bottle production factory owned by Quinn Glass, containing two glass melting furnaces and 13 bottle production lines. It was estimated that ¬£250 million was invested into this project and the factory outputs 1.2 billion bottles per year. It has recently been proposed that a 95 kilowatt power station and various recycling plants be sited on a water meadow near Elton. The land is owned by Peel Holdings and the proposal is in its embryonic stage. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches to Little Stanney with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,557. Transport Ince & Elton railway station serves both Ince and Elton villages. There are infrequent Monday to Saturday services to Ellesmere Port, Stanlow & Thornton, Helsby, Liverpool Lime Street, and Warrington Bank Quay. The nearest station with better services and facilities is either Ellesmere Port or Helsby. The number X2 bus visits Elton hourly in each direction, which runs between Chester via Ellesmere Port to Runcorn Halton Lea bus station. This service is operated by Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire. Elton also has a few morning and evening journeys on service DB8 to and from Chester Business Park.

Josephsohn was born in K√∂nigsberg (today's Kaliningrad), East Prussia. Here he attended elementary school and completed high school in 1937. That same year, he left his homeland and moved to Florence with a small scholarship, in order to study art. Due to his Jewish ancestry, he had to leave Italy a short time later and fled to Switzerland. He arrived in Zurich in 1938 and became a student of the sculptor Otto M√ºller. In 1943 Josephsohn moved into his first atelier, and starting in 1964 began showing his works in various solo shows within Switzerland. He acquired Swiss citizenship in 1964. Josephsohn's works began to attract the attention of a larger audience at the end of the 1990s. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam dedicated a large solo exhibition to the artist in 2002. In 2003 Josephson received the art prize of Zurich. Various group and solo exhibitions followed this, among others in the Di√∂zesanmuseum Kolumba in Cologne (2005) and in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris (2007). In 2008, the MMK Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt/Main organized a large solo exhibition of Josephsohn's works. In the years since 2000, Josephsohn's work has increasingly been regarded, also internationally, as a significant contribution to visual art. Permanent installations of Hans Josephsohn's works can be seen at the museum La Congiunta in Tessin, Switzerland, which was built by Peter M√§rkli and Stefan Bellwalder and opened in 1992. In 2003 the Kesselhaus Josephsohn in St. Gallen, Switzerland, opened, where a regularly alternating selection of works is presented. At the same time, the Kesselhaus is functioning as a storage and archive for Josephsohn's works and it is located next to the Kunstgiesserei St. Gallen where Hans Josephsohn's works are cast. Hans Josephsohn is represented by the Galerie Felix Lehner and Hauser & Wirth. On Hans Josephsohn's work Josephsohn's sculptures focused on the human figure as a volume in space. From the beginning of his career he worked, from the model, on sculpture's most timeless, constant themes: Representations of the human figure, standing, sitting, reclining, working on portrait heads or half-figures, made in plaster, some then later, cast in bronze. Josephsohn's figures are bereft of any portrait-like individualization. And they stand out for their simplicity, for their being limited to the simple postures of the human body. The wish for permanence plays a key role: \\"My figures must be enduring in their expression, in their stance\\", Josephsohn said, \\"A narrative gesture is out of the question\\". His works evoke prehistory, ancient stone steles and romanesque figures. Josephsohn's favourite working material was plaster. He found it ideal - simply it permits directness and spontaneity, both of which were necessary for Josephsohn's working process. Plaster allowed him to repeatedly add material or take it away. The directness of the work process was reflected not only in the immense vitality of the figures but even more by the traces left by this process. For example, finger imprints remain on the surface, referencing the artist's hands as it seeks to mold the material. His artistic examination of the human figure was influenced and determined by his own experience, which for him as an artist, shaped above all by his everyday work in the studio but also by the interpersonal relations in his life. He found his models in his own personal world: They were for the most part friends, relatives - almost always women, very often his own life partner. Real persons are the starting point of this work and search for forms but his works hardly ever had portrait-like character or individual traits. Thus, also for those who knew Josephsohn's models personally, when viewing the corresponding works there is little to remind one of the individuals.

The restaurant became famous when it was mentioned in several M*A*S*H episodes and is noted for its signature sandwich and large collection of hot dog buns signed by celebrities. History Mundings Tin Shop and Sheet Metal Works occupied the building before becoming Tony Packo's Cafe. Image dates to 1913 During the depression in 1932, Tony Packo used a $100 loan to open his shop, which originally sold only sandwiches and ice cream. In 1935, the Packo family purchased the current wedge-shaped building on the corner of Front and Consaul streets next to the Maumee River, which includes the former Consaul Tavern. Tony's signature \\"sausage-and-sauce sandwich\\" on rye was first made when he decided to add a spicy chili sauce to his sandwiches for more flavor. Eventually, his creation became known as the \\"Hungarian hot dog\\", even though no such thing had come from the Old Country. The dish quickly became popular and the cafe is now billed as \\"the place where man bites dog\\". The \\"hot dog\\" is really a Hungarian sausage called kolb√°sz, not unlike the Polish kielbasa, about twice the diameter of a conventional hot dog, and slicing the sausage in half yields about the same amount of meat. Nancy Packo Horvath took control of the business in 1962 when her father Tony Packo became seriously ill. Founder Tony Packo died in 1963 at 55 years of age. In 1968, Ms. Horvath's brother Tony Packo Jr. joined the company at age 20. The company had a long period of growth in the late 1960s under the leadership of the siblings. The Packos started in the packaged food business in 1980 after Merco Foods agreed to carry a line of pickles. In July 2002, Ms. Horvath and her son Robin Horvath (himself a Packo's vice president), sued Mr. Packo and his son Tony Packo III for libel, breach of duty, and trying to force her out of the business. A week later, Mr. Packo and his son counter-sued to dissolve the business claiming that as each family owned 50 percent of the company they were at an impasse. The families settled their dispute in October 2002 by adding an impartial third person to the company's board of directors. Mr. Packo said the problem occurred due to having no formalized succession plan in place. Soon after the dispute was settled, Ms. Horvath was diagnosed with cancer and died on 23 April 2003. Robert G. Bennett bought Tony Packo's, Inc., in October 2011 for $5.5 million in a court-ordered sale. Bennett died in May 2013. In October 2019, Packo's opened up two concept stores in Perrysburg, Ohio, and Holland, Ohio area Kroger grocery stores. =Bun signing= A souvenir hotdog bun from Tony Packo's Cafe signed by the photographer. When actor Burt Reynolds visited Toledo in 1972, he made a stop at the restaurant on the suggestion of Tony's daughter, Nancy. Reynolds was the first big name to eat at Packo's, and he also began the tradition of \\"bun signing\\" when he inscribed his signature on a Packo hot dog bun. Ever since then, celebrities who visit the restaurant sign a \\"bun\\"‚Äînow a foam, air-brushed look-alike‚Äîand have it placed on the walls of Packo's. =M*A*S*H= Tony Packo's Cafe gained world-wide fame when M*A*S*H character Maxwell Klinger, who was played by Toledo native Jamie Farr, made mention of the restaurant in six episodes. He first said in a 1976 episode, \\"If you're ever in Toledo, Ohio, on the Hungarian side of town, Tony Packo's got the greatest Hungarian hot dogs.\\" In one episode, the hospital unit ordered a batch of sausage casings from Packo's to use in a blood-filtering machine (a crude artificial kidney). In another, a wounded soldier from Toledo sends Klinger a shipment of Packo's hot dogs as a thank-you gift. Packo's was also mentioned in the two-and-a-half hour final episode. The restaurant displays several M*A*S*H mementos on the premises.

Due to its proximity, and connection through the KTM to Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Kuala Lumpur International Airport, it is a rapidly growing town. Development projects can be seen as one drives around Nilai. Some of Malaysia's most well-known colleges and two universities are located in Nilai: Nilai University, INTI International University, Manipal International University, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia and Islamic University College of Malaysia. As a result, the town is occupied by students from all over the world. Students from over 30 countries can be seen in Nilai. Nilai has become a popular shopping town with the establishment of several major shopping malls such as Nilai 3 Wholesale Centre, Nilai Square, AEON Mall, Mydin, Giant Hypermarket and Tesco Hypermarket. Then, a new shopping mall was completed and opened on 29 June 2017, which is Mesamall. Etymology The word Nilai means value in Malay. History Nilai Municipal Council =Founding= Nilai has its own unique origin and history. Historically, Nilai was under luak Sungai Ujong that was administered by waris di Darat or waris di Air. Under Dato‚Äô Johan from waris di Darat there are three Dato‚Äô Lingkungan that control lead the 3 corak suku Batu Hampar that are concentrated in a few villages. Other lines including those from Bentan that are not based on suku, but are based on the village where they live. As a Lembaga waris Perut Hulu, Waris Telaga Undang Dato‚Äô Johan is not a titian balai because Dato‚Äô Andika is more senior. However the power endowed by Dato‚Äô Kelana Putera to collect tax until the year 1894 shows that the Dato‚Äô Johan position with respect to balai Undang is important. The third Dato‚Äô Johan which is Dato‚Äô Maamor is the Dato‚Äô Kelana Putra, the 8th Undang Luak Sungai Ujong. Even while being appointed as Pesaka Dato' Kelana Putera, Dato‚Äô Maamor is still a child. At that time, Pesaka Dato' Kelana Putera position is left vacant since 1887 when Dato' Mohd Yusof, the Undang Luak Sungai Ujong is relieved from duty. Because waris Perut Hulu does not have a son to hold the pesaka, so the anak-anak buah unanimously appointed Dato‚Äô Maamor who was still a child to hold the pesaka Dato' Johan and then titled Dato‚Äô Kelana. The jurisdiction of Dato‚Äô Johan also covers Lenggeng Mukim which includes Mendum Village, Lenggeng Village, Sungai Jai Village, Hulu Beranang Village and Dacing Village. All these villages have their own ketua adat called ‚ÄòTua Waris‚Äô. There are also suku of Minangkabau people that are concentrated on other luak in Negeri Sembilan before settling in Lenggeng Village. To ensure their welfare in Luak Sungai Ujong, all suku were given ‚ÄòTua Waris‚Äô to be their representative in matters relating to tradition and administration in Balai Undang Luak.http://www.mpn.gov.my/en/latar-belakang-nilai =Recent times= Nilai was under Seremban District Council, and then upgraded to Nilai Municipal Council in 2002.

Siveria or Sivershchyna, ) is a historical region in present-day central-west Russia, northern Ukraine, eastern Belarus. The largest part lies in modern Russia, while the central part of the region is the city Novhorod-Siverskyi in Ukraine. Severians The region received its name from the Severians, an East Slavic tribe which inhabited the territory in the late 1st millennium A.D.; their name is Slavic meaning \\"Northerners\\". Their main settlements included seven cities of modern Russia (Kursk, Rylsk, Starodub, Trubchevsk, Sevsk, Bryansk, Belgorod) and five cities of modern Ukraine (Liubech, Novhorod-Siverskyi, Chernihiv, Putyvl, Hlukhiv). According to the Primary Chronicle, the Severians paid tribute to the Khazars, along with the neighboring Polans. Prince Oleg of Novgorod (reigned 879‚Äì912) conquered them and incorporated their lands into the new principality of Kievan Rus'. By the time of Yaroslav the Wise (1019‚Äì1054) the Severian peoples had lost most of their distinctness, and the areas of Severia along the upper course of the Desna River became controlled by Chernihiv. In 1096, Oleg I of Chernigov (also referred to as Oleh) created a large Severian Principality, which stretched as far as the upper reaches of the Oka River. Until the end of the century, the principality served as a buffer state against Cuman attacks. Its most celebrated ruler was Prince Igor (1150‚Äì1202), whose exploits are recounted in the 12th century epic The Tale of Igor's Campaign. After the Mongol invasion of Rus', the principality became largely ruined, however it remained intact throughout repeated Tatar invasions. Unfortunately, not much is known about this period as Severia was rarely mentioned in written accounts of the 13th century. By the mid 14th century, it was already part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as appanage duchy,Vortman, D., Vermenych, Ya. Novhorod-Siverskyi (–ù–û–í–ì–û–†–û–î-–°–Ü–í–ï–†–°–¨–ö–ò–ô). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine whose Gediminid princes (Ruthenian-speaking and Orthodox by religion) established their capitals in the cities of Novhorod-Siverskyi, Starodub, and Trubchevsk. During the 1501-1503 Lithuanian-Muscovite wars, an ally of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Khan of Great Horde Sheikh Ahmed destroyed the duchy's capital Novgorod-Siverskyi which by that time was controlled by Muscovites. After the Lithuanian defeat at the Battle of Vedrosha, the Severian Principality was acquired by Muscovy. After the war the duchy was controlled by Muscovite subject Prince Vasiliy Shemiachich (after he was imprisoned in Moscow in 1523, the duchy was governed by Muscovite voivodes (capetanus)). During the 18th century, the Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks established residences in the towns of Baturyn, Hlukhiv, and Pochep. Hlukhiv, in particular, developed into a veritable capital of 18th-century Ukraine. After the Bolshevik Revolution, the Severian lands, populated by a mixture of Ukrainians and Russians, were divided between the Ukrainian and Russian Soviet republics, finally dividing the land of the former Severians.  Culture  Since the 16th and 17th centuries, the specific Severian icon-painting style had been forming. It was much influenced by conservative Byzantine specimens which dominated in the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Severian icons are characterized by internal restraint, severeness and asceticism. These features survived during the Baroque epoch: volume and emotions were almost absent. The collection of Severian icons is preserved in the Museum of Ukrainian home icons of the Radomysl Castle.

It was directed by Jim Wynorski under the pseudonym \\"Jay Andrews\\".* Plot The space shuttle Olympus is on a routine mission, but with a far-from-routine payload: \\"Project Viper\\", an experimental hybrid of human genes and computer chips, designed to adapt to any environment, particularly that of the planet Mars. But as the shuttle crew prepares to launch the first prototype, referred to as \\"Viper\\", into space, an unexpected power glitch occurs, causing the container housing the prototype to break open. Soon the astronauts are killed by Viper, and the Secretary of Defense orders the remaining second prototype Viper destroyed - which is stored in a secure NovaGen Science facility, the manufacturer of the prototype. To do the job, he calls on special agent Mike Connors. Unaware of these proceedings, Project Viper head Nancy Burnham and her team at NovaGen - Steve Elkins, Sid Bream and Alan Stanton - are celebrating the fruition of their scientific dream. One more member, Cafferty, is on her way - but is killed by a rogue police officer, who is planning to steal the second prototype. Along with his wife, he steals the second Viper from the NovaGen high security lab, shooting several guards and technicians in the process. Mike Connors arrives at the scene, only to chase the thieves into a nearby forest, Thought the rogue police officer is killed, his wife escapes along with Viper's container unscathed and unseen by Connors and military personnel. Along with another accomplice, the thieves steal a small cargo plane and head towards their base, but a catastrophic engine failure causes their aircraft to crash into a forest 50 miles north of the Mexican border near a small town of Lago Nogales. In the crash, Viper's container is broken open and ends up into the environment, killing and devouring the thieves and a couple. Connors, Burnham and crew arrive at the crash site to investigate and trace Viper's trails of gray, gelatinous remains to the small town. After carrying out tests and experiments, investigating human disappearances caused as Viper feeds, they reach the conclusion that Viper is attracted to the uranium-contaminated town water system, where it has a concentrated point in an abandoned uranium mine. Connors orders an electromagnetic pulse bomb, though he encounters Viper at the police station and battles and kills Steve Elkins who revealed that he deliberately programmed Viper to kill humans and in doing so, rid himself of Bream and Stanton. Along with Burnham and a former suspicious sheriff Morgan, they successfully destroy Viper with the EMP bomb at the mine and escape unharmed, with the exception of the sheriff. Back at the NASA tracking facility, Connors, Burnham and the Secretary of Defense learn that the first prototype Viper aboard the shuttle Olympus re-enters atmosphere and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

The species, especially its Edible fruit, is also commonly referred to as Quandong or Native Peach. The use of the fruit as an exotic flavouring, one of the best known Bush tucker (bush food), has led to the attempted domestication of the species. Desert Quandong is an Evergreen tree, its fruit can be stewed to make pie filling for Quandong pies or made into a fruit juice drink. The seed (kernel) inside the tough shell can be extracted to be crushed into a paste then be used on sore gums or an oral gum boil to ease the pain. In far-west New South Wales being one of the few drought-tolerant fruit trees around, many aboriginal communities and local Australians that know about this fruit like to grow it. Description Santalum acuminatum grows as a tall shrub, or small tree, high and wide. The rough bark is dark grey and the branches ascending in character. Smaller plants formed by suckers from the roots are sometimes found surrounding larger plants. The smaller branches have a more weeping habit. The slender to ovate leaves are pointed at the tip, and are pale yellowish-green bringing a slightly grey and leathery appearance. These are supported on a short leaf stem, 5 ‚Äì 10 mm long, the leaves themselves being 45 ‚Äì 115 mm long. They are tapered in outline, and arranged in opposite pairs on the branchlets. Flowers can be green or creamy white on the outer parts, reddish or yellowish brown on the inner faces; these appear on stems, are just 2‚Äì3 mm across, and are fragrant. Fruit is produced after 4 years and is red or sometimes yellow, measuring between 20 and 25 mm across. A 3-mm layer of flesh covers a brain-like nut with a hard shell that encases the seed. This fruit is referred to as a drupe. It ripens from green to a shiny red in late spring or summer, and is globe-shaped and 20 to 40 mm across. The skin of the fruit is waxy. Roots are adapted to a hemiparasitic mechanism, using a haustorium, on roots able to reach out 10 m to other root systems. Taxonomy and naming The species shares the common name quandong with other plants, bearing similar fruit; it may be distinguished as the 'desert' or 'sweet'. The name quandong usually refers to the fruit of S. acuminatum in commercial usage. Variant spelling includes quondong and quandang. The fruit and plant are also named sweet quandong and native peach. The plant was known to many different indigenous language groups, and is therefore known by many different names. The Wiradjuri people of New South Wales used the name guwandhang, from which the name quandong was adapted. Other indigenous names include; wolgol (Noongar, South Western Australia) gutchu (Wotjobaluk, Western Victoria); wanjanu or mangata (Pitjantjatjara, Uluru), and goorti (Narungga). The species was first described by Robert Brown, named in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae (1810) as Fusanus acuminatus, based on his type collection made at Fowlers Bay, South Australia, in 1802. Brown gave the Latin epithet acuminatus to denote the leaves ‚Äì sharpened or pointed. The botanist Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle gave the current name in 1857, placing it in the genus Santalum; the genus containing Australian sandalwood, Santalum spicatum, and white sandalwood, Santalum album. Several botanical names have been deemed to be synonymous with Santalum acuminatum, as described in Flora of Australia (1984) and the Australian Plant Census (2006), these include: Santalum preissii F.Muell. in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae (1861); Santalum cognatum and Santalum preissianum of Miquel (1845); and Santalum densiflorum Gand. (1919). Mida acuminata was given by Otto Kuntze in an attempted revision, as with Eucarya acuminata (R.Br.) Sprague and Summerh. A number of cultivars have been named in application for plant breeders' rights, of which two have been accepted and another has been granted. The first named cultivar of the species was named 'Powell's # 1', but application for legal recognition of this name was withdrawn. The second is known as 'Powell's Red Supreme'. Two names are given as accepted applications in the Plant Varieties Journal: 'Powell's Red Supreme' and 'Saltbush Lane'. One variety of S. acuminatum is named in accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants; following the publication of a description, Santalum acuminatum 'Frahn's Paringa Gem'(Plant Varieties Journal 17:1) became the first cultivar to be receive legal protection. Distribution Santalum acuminatum is widely distributed throughout most southern regions of mainland Australia, including the arid centre of the country, and in some regions is common. The related Australian sandalwood, Santalum spicatum, was once more populous than this species; commercial exploitation has reversed this position. The plant occurs in Western Australia's north to Carnarvon and Karratha (21 N), reaching inland from the coastal plains, and is found throughout Southwest Australia. The number of recorded specimens in this region is low, and mainly restricted to coastal sandplains, its range having been impacted by altered land-use in the wheatbelt. Some populations are discontinuous in the distribution range, as with many species of the region, beyond the dispersal range of the seeds. Remote groups of the species are remnant to former distribution ranges, to different climates, and these may be isolated by hundreds of kilometres. The species is one of those in the region to include \\"wet outliers\\", small populations outside of the usual low rainfall habitat. Occurrence of the plant is also recorded in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and Queensland. It is widespread in western New South Wales, eastwards to Dubbo and Culcairn. It is rare in the northwest of the state. Ecology The plant is hemiparasitic, able to photosynthesize, but using the root system of other plants to acquire nutrients other than sugars. The plant genus Santalum attaches to other species, in a nondestructive way, sustaining itself by their provision of nitrogen, shade, and water. The roots of the species have pad- like adaptations, that nearly encircle the host's root, which is typical of this genus of sandalwoods. Hosts can be other trees, or grasses, usually several plants are used. The taxa recorded in this relationship are species of genera; Acacia, Maireana, Atriplex, and many others, including hemiparasites such as Exocarpos sparteus. This mechanism allows the plant to acquire 70% of its nitrogen, and some of its water requirements from the roots of other trees and shrubs. The tree occupies a diverse and widespread range of habitats, including creek beds, granite, gravel plains, and sandy dunes. It is tolerant of drought, salt, and high temperatures, and need not have a nutrient-rich environment. The seedling can become established in the shade of its host, reaching for full sun once developed, so the plant is usually intermingled with host and other species. The environs of the distribution range are subject to frequent bushfires, this requires the plant to regenerate from its roots, so the species is rarely found as an advanced tree. Those specimens exposed to bushfire and soil disturbance occur as sprawling multistemmed shrubs. The plant's regrowth from the root system gives this species a lead over shrubs that recur from seed. Trees with a single main stem are in locations remote from these factors. The habit of older trees may overwhelm the adjacent plants by monopolising the sunlight and parasitising roots of plants beyond its own canopy. The foliage, being much paler than other trees and shrubs, makes the plant conspicuous in bushland and scrub. An occurrence of an unmolested specimen is recorded at Woodman Point in Western Australia, an area remote from the high-intensity fires of altered regimens. Emus eat the fruit, and it forms an important part of their diet; the nut remains undigested in their droppings. This is the usual method of S. acuminatum seed dispersal, when it is within the emu's range. A number of species interact with this plant, in a number of complex relationships, a noted example being Paraepermenia santaliella, the quandong moth of the family Epermeniidae. Other creatures, such as larvae of nitidulid beetles and the wood white butterfly, also feed on S. acuminatum. Cultivation A desert quandong nut on a piece of paperbark The fruit and nut were important foods to the peoples of arid and semiarid central Australia, especially for its high vitamin C content. It is commercially grown and marketed as a bush food and is sometimes made into a jam, an enterprise begun in the 1970s. It is well known as an exotic food. =Propagation and pests= Inadequate knowledge of the plant's ecology led to many early failures in the cultivation of this species. Commercial trials and propagation by enthusiasts have attempted to reproduce the circumstances of its native habitat; well-drained soil, germination techniques, and selection of appropriate hosts have been more successful. Germinating the seed has been more successful, up to 35% when it laid aside for 12 ‚Äì 18 months. Growers laying seeds into mulch, obtained from host plants, report a high rate of success. Cultivation of this plant has faced other obstacles; for example, the species is susceptible to a number of pests and fungal diseases. The research and development of domestication of the species was first undertaken by Brian Powell, at a property in Quorn, South Australia. The successful plants in this trial are classed as \\"Significant Trees\\" by the state's National Trust. This venture came to be supported by the CSIRO, in the 1970s, eventually becoming part of the research body's Sustainable Ecosystems division. The development of horticultural practice for the establishment of commercial orchards is being researched by a number of projects. Research and trials were undertaken in South Australia by grafting 'Frahn's Paringa Gem' onto seedling rootstock; this is how the cultivar is propagated in orchards, and the first sale of the variety was in 1997. Host plants are needed in the establishment of an orchard; the species selected for this purpose impart factors affecting growth, resistance to infestation, and the harvest. The study of Melia azedarach (white cedar) as a host to this species revealed that S. acuminatum acquired insecticidal compounds that increased its resistance to the quandong moth. Researchers then determined that neurotoxins found in the host plant, and other substances harmful to mammals, can pass into the harvested fruit. =Diseases= Soil-borne agents of disease, such as Phytophthora and Pythium fungal species, may be present where the plant's preference for well-drained soil is not provided. Nurseries have found the plant to be responsive to the treatments prescribed, if its presence is suspected, such as phosphorous acid soil applications. A climate of high heat and humidity has occasionally induced black spot on the leaves. =Harvest= The fruit and nut of S. acuminatum are collected from the tree, or the nut from a dropping of the emu; wild harvest remains as the primary source for the widely used fruit. This was the method adopted by the colonists after their introduction to it. The plant produces large amounts of fruit in years of good rainfall; Indigenous Australians would dry this harvest and store the flesh for up to 8 years. The establishment of experimental plantations, by the CSIRO in the 1970s, has resulted in a steady increase in supply by orchards to the market. This harvest is able to be protected from infestation, and is an easily identifiable source, meeting the requirements of food safety guidelines for commercial ingredients. The plants produce a yield of 10 to 25 kg of fruit, 40% of the total weight is that of the kernel; the fruit is marketed as a fresh or dried product. The kernel is edible when raw, and is also roasted and salted. Uses =Culinary Use= Leaves and a fruit of quandong, detail of sketch by Olive Pink (1930) The commercial use of the fruit includes its addition to sweet and savoury foods; the flavour is tart and reminiscent of peach, apricot, or rhubarb. In South Australia S. acuminatum is called \\"wild peach\\" or \\"desert peach\\". The fruit and nut of the plant were featured in a bushfood series of stamps produced by Australia Post. It is well known as an exotic food in foreign markets, sales that greatly exceed the consumption in its own country. The fruit also has free radical-scavenging ability.Zhao, J., Agboola, S., Functional Properties of Australian Bushfoods ‚Äì A Report for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation , 2007, RIRDC Publication No 07/030. The fruit has been made commercially available, the distinctive flavour is used as an additive, particularly as a uniquely Australian product. This has usually been sourced from wild trees, sometimes by Aboriginal corporations, although the viability of commercial orchards is also being trialled. Many Aboriginal peoples are known to have used the fruit, but mainly they gathered the nuts. The undigested nut can be easily gathered from emu droppings. The kernel has been identified, analysed, and monitored, as a \\"wild-harvested Australian indigenous food\\", by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. The product is found to be very high in fats, over half by weight. =Medicinal Use= The fruit, containing vitamin C, and the kernel of the nut, containing complex oils, were used by the peoples in whose countries the species occurred. Antibacterial qualities are present in the wood of this, and all the Santalum species, especially in the roots. A known application of the extract was to heal ailments of the skin. The commercial production of cogenor S. spicatum is more advanced than this species, although research is being undertaken into the marketing of these medicinal substances. =Fuel= The seed is very high in flammable oils, like a candlenut, so it is able to be burnt as an illuminant. The wood is also oily, useful for starting a fire as a friction stick. =Timber= The hard, oily, timber is used for furniture and cabinet making by regional craftsmen, but it is not used extensively. It is a durable material, but lacks the aromatic qualities of other sandalwoods. The hard and wrinkled nuts have been used ornamentally, for necklaces and shirt buttons, and were used as marbles on chinese checkers' boards. History The oil of sandalwoods, primarily Santalum album, was described and investigated by pharmacologists. The more widely known Australian sandalwood, S. spicatum, was extensively harvested and exported, leaving S. acuminatum as the more common Santalum in many regions. The established use of the fruit, by Aboriginal peoples, was acknowledged by the early settlers of the colonies; this product was made into jam and chutney. The fruit is frequently mentioned in natural histories and botanical works, such as Flowers and plants of Western Australia, and traded as a commodity, however, the kernel of the seed has, historically, been the most extensively used. Colonial ethnic groups did not attempt to domesticate indigenous plants in Australia, despite being known and occasionally used, but the great demand from export markets to Singapore, Britain, and elsewhere led to financial backing of growers and enthusiasts. The backyard of Dudley and Lyla Frahn in Paringa, South Australia, contained an orchard of quandongs. The couple recorded yield and qualities of the fruit, one of which became the source for the variety registered and marketed as 'Frahn's Paringa Gold'.

In Australia, V. cardui has a limited range around Bunbury, Fremantle, and Rottnest Island. However, its close relative, the Australian painted lady (V. kershawi, sometimes considered a subspecies) ranges over half the continent. Other closely related species are the American painted lady (V. virginiensis) and the West Coast lady (V. annabella). Migration Vanessa cardui spring migration between North Africa and Europe V. cardui occurs in any temperate zone, including mountains in the tropics. The species is resident only in warmer areas, but migrates in spring, and sometimes again in autumn. It migrates from North Africa and the Mediterranean to Britain and Europe in May and June, and from the Red Sea basin, via Israel and Cyprus, to Turkey in March and April. The occasional autumn migration made by V. cardui is likely for the inspection of resource changes; it consists of a round trip from Europe to Africa.Puig‚ÄêMontserrat, X., Izquierdo, R., Ubach, A., & Arrizabalaga, A. (2017, July 20). Back to Africa: autumn migration of the painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is timed to coincide with an increase in resource availability. Retrieved March 6, 2020, from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/een.12442 For decades, naturalists have debated whether the offspring of these immigrants ever make a southwards return migration. Research suggests that British painted ladies do undertake an autumn migration, making round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle in a series of steps by up to six successive generations. The Radar Entomology Unit at Rothamsted Research provided evidence that autumn migrations take place at high altitude, which explains why these migrations are seldom witnessed. In recent years, thanks to the activity of The Worldwide Painted Lady Migration citizen science project, led by the Barcelona-based Institute of Evolutionary Biology (Catalan: Institut de Biologia Evolutiva), the huge range of migration has begun to be revealed. For example, some butterflies migrated from Iceland to the Sahara desert, and even further south. V. cardui is known for its distinct migratory behaviour. In California, they are usually seen flying from north to north-west. These migrations appear to be partially initiated by heavy winter rains in the desert where rainfall controls the growth of larval food plants.Orsak, L.J. (1977). The Butterflies of Orange County, California. Center for Pathobiology Miscellaneous Publication #3. University of California Press, New York. 349 pp. Similarly, heavier than usual rain during the 2018-2019 winter seems to have been the cause of the extraordinarily large migration observed in Israel at the end of March, estimated at a billion individual butterflies. Painted lady migration patterns are highly erratic and they do not migrate every year.Larsen, T.B. 1984. Butterflies of Saudi Arabia and Its Neighbours. Stacey International, London, 160 pp. Some evidence suggests that global climatic events, such as el Ni√±o, may affect the migratory behaviour of the painted lady butterflies, causing large-scale migrations.Tilden, J.W. (1962). General characteristics of the movements of Vanessa cardui (L.). Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera 1: 43-49. The first noticeable wave of migration in eastern Ukraine was noted in the 20s of April 2019. From May 15, numbers began to grow and it was possible to observe hundreds of this species in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, including in the city streets of Kharkiv.Annual report of the Department of Science and nature monitoring, National nature park \\"Gomil\`shans\`ky Lisy\\" (Ukraine, Kharkiv region). 2018 and 2019 years. Based on experimental data, the painted lady's migration pattern in northern Europe apparently does not follow a strict north-west heading. The range of headings suggests that migrating butterflies may adjust their migration patterns in response to local topographical features and weather, such as strong wind patterns. Laboratory- raised autumn-generation painted lady butterflies were able to distinguish a southern orientation for a return migration path. According to the same laboratory-based study, when butterflies were isolated from the sun, they were unable to orient themselves in a specific direction, opposed to those that did have access to the sun. This suggests that V. cardui requires a direct view of the sky, implying the use of a solar compass to orient its migratory direction and maintain a straight flight path.Nesbit, R.L., J.K. Hill, I.P. Woiwod, D. Sivell, K.J. Bensusan, and J.W. Chapman (2009). \\"Seasonally Adaptive Migratory Headings Mediated By A Sun Compass In The Painted Lady Butterfly, Vanessa cardui. Animal Behaviour 78: 1119-1125. Print. Mating behaviour in relation to migration V. cardui displays a unique system of continuous mating, throughout all seasons, including the winter. This may be attributed to its migratory patterns, thus significantly affecting its mating behaviour. During European migrations, the butterflies immediately begin to mate and lay eggs upon arrival in the Mediterranean in the spring, starting in late May.Stefanescu, C., P√°ramo, F., √Ökesson, S., Alarc√≥n, M., √Åvila, A., Brereton, T., Carnicer, J., Cassar, L. F., Fox, R., Heli√∂l√§, J., Hill, J. K., Hirneisen, N., Kjell√©n, N., K√ºhn, E., Kuussaari, M., Leskinen, M., Liechti, F., Musche, M., Regan, E. C., Reynolds, D. R., Roy, D. B., Ryrholm, N., Schmaljohann, H., Settele, J., Thomas, C. D., van Swaay, C. and Chapman, J. W. (2012), Multi- generational long-distance migration of insects: studying the painted lady butterfly in the Western Palaearctic. Ecography. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07738.x In the United States, painted lady butterflies migrating towards the north experience poor mating conditions, and many butterflies have limited breeding capabilities. The \\"local adult generation\\" develops during this time, roughly from the middle of May through early June in conjunction with the butterfly progression throughout their flight. During its migratory process, these painted lady butterflies start breeding, and reproduce entirely throughout their migration.Vandenbosch, R. (2003), Fluctuations of Vanessa cardui butterfly abundance with El Ni√±o and Pacific Decadal Oscillation climatic variables. Global Change Biology, 9: 785‚Äì790. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00621.x Scientists have not been able to find evidence of their overwintering; this may be because they migrate to warmer locations to survive and reproduce. Female painted lady butterflies may suspend their flight temporarily when they are \\"ready to oviposit\\";Tilden, J. W. (1962). \\"General Characteristics of the Movements of Vanessa cardui (L.)\\" Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera 43-49 this allows them the opportunity to continually reproduce throughout their migrations. Because these butterflies are constantly migrating, male butterflies are thought to lack consistent territory. Instead of requiring territory to mate with females and developing evolutionary behaviour to defend this territory, the mating butterflies appear to establish a particular \\"time and place\\" in certain locations that they find to be suitable for reproduction. More specifically, they locate certain perches, hilltops, forest-meadow edges, or other landmarks where they will stay until, presumably, a female arrives to mate. Equally important for the reproduction of the painted lady butterflies is the males' exhibition of polygynous mating behaviour, in which they often mate with more than one female. This is important for painted lady butterflies because the benefits may supersede the costs of polygynyDavies, N., Krebs, J., & West, S. (2012). An introduction to behavioural ecology. (4th ed.). West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell. since no permanent breeding ground is used. Upon mating, which typically occurs in the afternoon, female painted lady butterflies lay eggs one by one in their desired breeding locations. The variety of eclosion locations ultimately dictates the male painted lady behaviour.Rutowski, Ronald L. (1991). \\"The Evolution of Male Mate-Locating Behavior in Butterflies\\". The American Naturalist Vol. 138, No. 5: 1121-1139. Female painted lady butterflies have been observed to have a relatively \\"high biotic potential\\", meaning they each produce large numbers of offspring. This perpetual influx of reproduction may be a reason why these painted lady butterflies have propagated so successfully. One interesting aspect that scientists have observed is that these butterflies like to fly towards rain. Further studies have suggested that the large amounts of rainfall may somehow \\"activate more eggs or induce better larval development\\".Abbott, Charles H. (1951). \\"A Quantitative Study of the Migration of the Painted Lady Butterfly, Vanessa cardui L.\\" Ecology Vol. 32, No. 2: 155-171. Inhabited locations begin to observe a large influx of new generations of painted lady butterflies in the fall, particularly in September and October. Their reproductive success declines relatively throughout the winter, primarily through November. However, they still continue to reproduce‚Äîan aspect of butterfly behaviour that is quite unique. Scientists hypothesize that these extensive migratory patterns help the painted lady butterflies find suitable conditions for breeding, thus offering a possible reason as to why these butterflies mate continuously. Oviposition Adult butterflies feed on flower nectar and aphid honeydew.Scott, J. A. 1986. The butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press. Females oviposit on plants with nectar immediately available for the adults even if it leads to high mortality of the larvae. This lack of discrimination indicates they do not take into account volatile chemicals released from potential host plants when searching for oviposition choices.O'Neill, Bridget F., Arthur R. Zangerl, Evan H. Delucia, and May R. Berenbaum. \\"Olfactory Preferences Of, AndforGrown Under Elevated CO.\\" Environmental Entomology 39.4 (2010): 1291-1301. Print. The availability of adult resources dictates a preference for specific areas of flowers. Flowers with more available nectar result in a larger number of eggs deposited on the plants. This reinforces the idea that the painted lady butterfly does not discriminate host plants and chooses mainly on the availability of adult food sources even if it increases the mortality rate of the offspring. The data also suggest that the painted lady butterfly favors quantity of offspring over quality.Janz, Niklas. \\"The Relationship Between Habitat Selection And Preference For Adult And Larval Food Resources In The Polyphagous Butterfly Vanessa Cardui (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)\\". Journal of Insect Behavior 18.6 (2005): 767-780. Print. Vision Painted lady butterflies have a visual system that resembles that of a honey bee. Adult V. cardui eyes contain ultraviolet, blue, and green photoreceptors. Unlike other butterflies, such as the monarch or red postman butterflies, painted ladies lack red receptors, which means that they are likely red-green colour-blind. Behavioral studies on the related species, Vanessa atalanta, have demonstrated that V. atalanta cannot discriminate yellow light from orange light or orange light from red light. Roosting behaviour and territory Groups of two to eight painted lady butterflies have been observed to fly in circles around each other for about one to five seconds before separating, symbolizing courtship. Groups of butterflies usually will not fly more than 4.5 m away from the starting point.Hardesty, Richard. \\"Roosting Behavior in Adult Vanessa cardui\\" Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society 41.2 (1987): 116-117 To establish and defend their territories, adult males perch in the late afternoon in areas where females are most likely to appear.Harris, M. 1999. \\"Vanessa cardui\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed September 16, 2013 at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Vanessa_cardui/ Once the male spots a female of the same species, he begins pursuit of her. If the foreign butterfly is a male, the original male will give chase, flying vertically for a few feet before returning to his perch.\\"Behaviors to Watch.\\" University of Minnesota Extension. Regents of the University of Minnesota, n.d.

N.p., n.d. Web. 16 September 2013. . Vanessa cardui tend to inhabit sunny, brightly lit, open environments and are often attracted to open areas of flowers and clovers. Adults spend time in small depressions in the ground on overcast days. Host plants Larvae feed on Asteraceae species, including Cirsium, Carduus, Centaurea, Arctium, Onopordum, Helianthus, and Artemisia.Vanessa cardui, Butterflies of Canada The painted lady uses over 300 recorded host plants according to the HOSTS database. Defence mechanisms The main defence mechanisms of the painted lady butterflies include flight and camouflage. The caterpillars hide in small silk nests on top of leaves from main predators that include wasps, spiders, ants, and birds.  Human interaction  Vanessa cardui and other painted lady species are bred in schools for educational purposes and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events, and weddings. In popular culture After heavy rain produced an abundance of vegetation in the deserts, Southern California saw these butterflies migrating by the millions across the state in March 2019.

This carriage dispute saw Media General stations disappear from Mediacom lineups in 14 television markets across the United States and even three of the Fox affiliates owned by Media General were lost to Mediacom subscribers in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Topeka, Kansas just before the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. On July 30, 2015, Mediacom and Media General reached a new agreement, thereby restoring Media General owned stations to Mediacom subscribers in the affected areas. =Mediacom views on carriage disputes and retransmission blackouts= On July 7, 2015, Mediacom filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission to limit or prevent blackouts of local broadcast stations during carriage disputes. According to Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso, the FCC has frequently neglected to address concerns regarding retransmission consent and blackouts of local television stations, particularly in rural areas, where residents have a more difficult time receiving an acceptable over-the-air signal. Commisso's proposal was for local broadcasters not to terminate a cable or satellite provider's carriage of the station's signal at the end of a retransmission consent agreement if the station does not reach a minimum of 90 percent of its local viewers within its DMA either over-the-air or via its online stream. Commisso also made note of the fact that retransmission consent fees double every two or three years ‚Äì something which never happens in any other industry.

He has served as Minister of Transport and Communications since 2020, and as Minister of the Environment from 2004 to 2005 in the second Bondevik cabinet. In 2007 he announced he would step down from the national political scene for the time being, but he returned when he was nominated as the top candidate for the Christian Democratic Party ticket in Akershus in the 2009 election where he won the county's leveling seat. After Dagfinn H√∏ybr√•ten stepped down as party leader, Hareide was unanimously elected to take his place at the 2011 party convention. In the 2013 election, Hareide was reelected to parliament, this time from his home county of Hordaland. Before his tenure as government minister, Hareide had sat through one term in the municipal council of his native B√∏mlo, served as a deputy representative to the national parliament as well as working two years as a State Secretary. He was also second deputy leader of his party from 2003 to 2007, having come through the ranks of the party's youth organization. Outside politics Hareide is an economist by education, and he has worked for the media conglomerate Schibsted. Education Hareide was born in the village Rubbestadneset in B√∏mlo, Hordaland. He started his higher education in 1992, the same year he graduated from upper secondary school. Enrolled at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), he graduated in 1997 with a siv.√∏k. degree. During his time at NHH, he also minored in sociology (1995) at the University of Bergen.. Retrieved on 2009-05-02. Hareide was active in student politics. His involvement included terms as a member of the student parliament at the University of Bergen, as the leader of the Student Union of the Norwegian School of Economics 1994-1995, and as a board member of the national student union 1993-1994. During the period in student politics, Hareide held a Christian democratic middle ground between radical (such as later socialist politician Aslak Sira Myhre) and conservative representatives, an experience he has described as educational. Career Hareide was active in the Youth of the Christian People's Party, being a member of the national board 1999‚Äì2001 before joining the national board of the Christian Democratic Party. He worked as a political advisor in the Ministry of Church Affairs, Education and Research from 1998 to 2000, during the first cabinet Bondevik. He later became State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance from 2001 to 2003 during the second cabinet Bondevik. In 2003 he became second deputy leader of the Christian Democratic Party nationwide. He then joined the cabinet during a 2004 reshuffle, serving as the Norwegian Minister of the Environment from summer 2004 to fall 2005. He was the youngest ever cabinet member from the Christian Democratic Party, and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bj√∏rn√∏y. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 1997-2001, 2001-2005 and 2005-2009\\\\. On the local level of politics he was a member of B√∏mlo municipality council from 1991 to 1995. In 2007 Hareide announced that he had left politics for the time being to pursue a career in the national media conglomerate Schibsted, as an organizational director. His career in the company started with the position of trainee in 1997. Outside politics, his only paid full-time appointments have been in Schibsted. He still works behind the scenes for his party, occasionally commenting on issues in the national media.an example from November 2007 He did not rule out a return to national politics in the future, and in late 2008 he was selected by his party as the top candidate on the party's ticket in Akershus county. The Christian Democratic Party formerly held a seat in this county, but lost it in 2005. Hareide has never lived in Akershus. Party leader Dagfinn H√∏ybr√•ten hails from Akershus, but he runs on the Rogaland ticket to secure a safe seat. Prior to the 2009 election, Hareide announced that he would leave national politics if he failed to win a parliament seat. Although the Christian Democrats suffered nationwide setbacks in 2009, Hareide managed to win Akershus' levelling seat after a close race against Dagfinn Sundsb√∏ of the Centre Party. In parliament, Hareide became the chair of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. After H√∏ybr√•ten announced that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed H√∏ybr√•ten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded that at least one of the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position. On 18 November 2011 Hareide was appointed to lead the parliamentary committee that is investigating the 2011 Norway Attacks. His nomination to that position was proposed by the red-green parties. On 23 January 2012 Hareide denounced a speech at KrF's local chapter in Sarpsborg that had suggested that the terrorist attacks and the Alexander Kielland disaster were divine warnings or punishments for Norway's policy towards Israel; Hareide said that this was far beyond normal thinking and completely out of line with the party's values. =Reception and issues= Following the 11th United Nations Climate Change Convention in Buenos Aires in December 2004, Hareide spoke out against the United States and China, whom he saw as \\"problems\\" in the international work against climate change. Hareide gained a fair level of praise for his role in the convention, from both his own party as well as political opponents. Hareide received heavy criticism for the policy on large carnivores. A decision in early 2005, to uphold the ongoing wolf hunt even though a certain alpha she-wolf Gr√•fjellstispa had mistakenly been shot in January that year, was met with protests from the national World Wildlife Fund chapter and other environment organizations, as well as the Swedish Minister of the Environment Lena Sommestad and representatives from the European Union. Hareide described the event as \\"regrettable\\", but \\"not against the law\\". The case made headlines in BBC and New Scientist. A few weeks before, Hareide had been criticized in a parliamentary hearing session for being too wolf-friendly. The environmental organizations went as far as to press charges against the Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry was acquitted when the case was finally brought up in late 2006, some time after Hareide left office. In July the same year, Hareide received further criticism as the number of licenses to kill large carnivores allegedly was not only at a record high (12 brown bears, 10 grey wolves, 22 wolverines and 13 lynx), but also contradictory to the parliamentary policy on the matter. According to Hareide, the actions were in line with the parliamentary stance on the issue. In April 2005 he was criticized for an issue connected to monetary support of environmental projects and organizations. The Ministry approved a $90,000 project support for the Church of Norway, while the pressure group Bellona faced a cut of the same amount. Hareide, being a devout Christian and a member of the Church of Norway, was accused of putting his own religious interests ahead of environmental considerations. The case became a curiosity in the Norwegian media as some of the money was channelled into the church internet site, which, among other things, contained a set of prayers for earthworms ‚Äì described in such odd terms as \\"the blind subterranean workers\\", \\"small sisters and brothers in the compost\\" and \\"members of the subterranean congregation\\". Hareide responded to the criticism by describing the overall project as \\"exciting\\". One of Hareide's last actions in office was to approve the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Hatteberg watershed in Kvinnherad, a protected natural area. Most of the criticism went to his successor, Helen Bj√∏rn√∏y, who neglected to roll back the decision when assuming office. She eventually resigned halfway into her term. During his time as Minister of the Environment, Hareide was parodied in the television comedy program Tre br√∏dre som ikke er br√∏dre. The character Knut Arild Hareide, played by Harald Eia, was portrayed in several sketches as a physically weak person. These parodies were criticized by the authors in a 2005 book about different forms of mobbing; this stirred a minor debate in the Norwegian media. Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video clip of one of the parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national politics at the 2007 party congress. In a poll taken in December 2013, Hareide received a 99 percent approval rating among Christian Democratic voters. =Resignation from party leadership= In September 2018, Hareide made an ultimatum to his own party, that they should either join the Labour Party and Centre Party to form a government, thereby toppeling the Solberg Cabinet, or entering the Solberg Cabinet, consisting of the Conservatives, Progress Party and Liberals. Hareide led the Labour-favoured campaign, and had it been successful, it would have led to Jonas Gahr St√∏re becoming prime minister. On the opposing side who favoured to enter the current cabinet, was Kjell Ingolf Ropstad and Olaug Bollestad. On the party conference on 2 November, the party voted to enter the Solberg cabinet. Negotiations eventually started to enter the cabinet, led by Ropstad himself. Hareide resigned as party leader in January 2019 and subsequently as parliamentary leader twelve days later. He was succeeded by Ropstad at the party conference in April the same year. =Return as minister= In January 2020, about a year after the Christian Democrats entered the Solberg cabinet, the Progress Party chose to withdraw after disagreements after a family was brought home from Syria with a sick child, which had been against their wishes. Hareide returned from a committee travel, presumed to be because of the changes in the government, something he didn't confirm or deny upon his arrival at Oslo Gardermoen Airport. By 23 January, rumours circulated that he might be appointed as minister, which was confirmed the day after, to be the position of Transport Minister. This marked the first time since Bondevik's second cabinet that Hareide held a ministerial post. His appointment was criticized by the Progress Party, who saw it as a taunt given his opposition to enter the Solberg Cabinet in 2018. Personal life Hareide comes from a middle-class background, his father being a transportation manager and his mother a consultant. Although reluctant to comment on the issue, Hareide was likely single during his first tenure in national politics. He has been confronted with rumours of homosexuality by segments of the media, but these have been dismissed. In 2008 he was reported as having a relationship with Solveig Engevik from Kolbotn, which ended in 2010. In the spring of 2011 he was confirmed in a relationship with school teacher Lisa Marie Larsen. The couple married in Moi on 23 June 2012, and had a daughter on 6 April 2013.

The name was taken from the location of the crimes, which were committed around the M25, London's orbital motorway, during the early hours of 16 December 1988.R v. Rowe Davis and Johnson.

The original trial took place between January and February 1990, resulting in all three being convicted of the murder of Peter Hurburgh, causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Timothy Napier and several robberies. Each was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and given substantial sentences for the other offences. The convictions were overturned in July 2000. All three men have consistently maintained their innocence. The M25 crime spree At some time between 11 p.m and 12.30 a.m, an armed gang of three men wearing balaclavas and driving a stolen green Triumph Spitfire approached a car in Chelsham, Surrey in which Peter Hurburgh and Alan Eley were having sex. The gang dragged the two men from the car, tied them up and stripped and beat them.Pullinger, Kate. The case of the M25 Three . Innocent.org. Retrieved 11 August 2009. Eley stated that one of the gang was armed with a knife, and another was holding a handgun. The gang then poured petrol over the two men, and Eley lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, Hurburgh was dead, having sustained five fractured ribs and a fractured sternum, which had bruised his heart leading to death from cardiac arrest. The assailants abandoned the Triumph Spitfire at the scene and stole Hurburgh's car, an Austin Princess which they then drove around the M25 to Oxted, Surrey. Here, at around 3.40 a.m, they broke into a home belonging to Richard Napier, then aged 66, who lived with his wife and 40-year-old son. The gang threatened the family with a knife and two handguns, one of which was described as a revolver. Timothy Napier sustained multiple knife wounds and Mrs Napier was instructed to remove her rings and jewellery. She was told that if she refused her fingers would be cut off. The house was ransacked and after 20‚Äì30 minutes, the robbers left, taking Timothy Napier's Toyota Corolla which had been parked near the house. Peter Hurburgh's Austin Princess was found abandoned 100 yards from the Napiers' house. The gang then drove around the M25 to Fetcham, Surrey, where at 5 a.m, they broke into the house of Rosemary Spicer and her boyfriend Peter Almond, who were threatened with a handgun, tied up and gagged while the house was ransacked. After between forty-five minutes and an hour the gang left in a Renault 5 and a Vauxhall Cavalier stolen from Spicer and Almond; Timothy Napier's Toyota was later found nearby. Arrests Rowe and Davis were arrested on the morning of 19 December 1988 at the probation hostel they shared in Sydenham, London and initially taken to Oxted Police Station.Thompson, Tony (23 July 2000). \\"'I'm back from the Stone Age'\\". The Guardian (London). Retrieved 12 August 2009. Johnson was apprehended on 6 January 1989, at which time he was found to be in possession of a revolver. Some of the items stolen during the Oxted and Fetcham robberies were recovered from the bail hostel. Davis' fingerprints were found on porcelain figures (unconnected) in a cupboard where property taken during one of the robberies was found. Also arrested were Shane Griffin, Jason Cooper and Mark Jobbins. In total, twelve people at the hostel were arrested. A further suspect, Norman Duncan, was already in police custody. Case against Rowe, Davis and Johnson Griffin and Duncan admitted stealing the Triumph Spitfire used by the gang that murdered Hurburgh, but testified that they had stolen it at the request of Rowe, on 13 December 1988. They claimed that it had been kept at the bail hostel until the evening of 15 December when Rowe, Davis and a third man, whom they did not know but who was alleged by the prosecution to be Johnson, had asked them for assistance to \\"bump start\\" the vehicle, between 23:00 and 00:00. They also testified that Rowe had asked for balaclavas. This same group of witnesses claimed that Rowe and Davis had returned on the morning of 16 December in the stolen Renault and Vauxhall Cavalier with a quantity of items, the proceeds of the robberies, which they helped to unload and hide. They alleged that they were then asked to dispose of the stolen vehicles, with the warning that they were a \\"bit warm\\" and that they would have to be burned completely to remove all identification. A girlfriend of Rowe, 16-year-old Kate Williamson, said that at the time the crimes were committed Rowe had left at approximately 01:30 and not returned until around 06:30, when he returned wearing different jeans and shoes and carrying a Sainsbury's bag, the same type of which had been taken in the Spicer/Almond robberies. Williamson claimed that Rowe took from the bag a pendant with a gold chain, a watch which was later found to be one taken during the Spicer robbery, and muddied jeans and boots. Williamson claimed that Rowe gave her two rings, later found to have been taken during the Napier robbery, a watch found to have been taken from the Spicer robbery, and a watchstrap from the Napier robbery. She handed all of the items to the police on 19 December 1988. Police also found a brooch taken in the Spicer robbery in a waste paper basket in Rowe's room. Williamson gave further evidence that when Rowe had left on the Thursday evening he had been wearing a particular type of distinctive footwear, and imprints made by this type of boot were found in a flowerbed at the Napier home and in blood in the Napier's hall. Weaknesses in the prosecution case A witness for the defence testified that he had seen the green Triumph Spitfire, in the location where it was eventually found, at approximately 00:30 on 16 December. Given Williamson's testimony that Rowe had still been at the bail hostel at this time, this placed Rowe away from the scene and therefore the subsequent crime spree. The judge at the original trial drew this to the jury's attention in his summing up, and also highlighted that the evidence of Jobbins, Duncan and Griffin came from men who essentially were accomplices, and Williamson was by her own admission a handler of stolen goods. There were also serious discrepancies between the appearance of the three defendants and the descriptions given by witnesses. All three defendants were black men, but Alan Eley had initially told the police he thought that only one of the assailants was black, the other two being white men, although all three had worn balaclavas throughout the attack. Both Richard Napier and his wife also said that they thought that at least one attacker was white, a view repeated by Rosemary Spicer. However, in both of the robberies, as with the attack on Eley and Hurburgh, none of the men had removed their balaclavas. Part of the prosecution case relied upon a conversation Johnson was alleged to have had with a fellow prisoner, in which he admitted guilt and described one of his accomplices as a \\"redskin\\". The prosecution pointed out that in his police interviews, Johnson also used the expression \\"redskin\\", a Jamaican term to describe someone with lightly coloured skin, and that Rowe was lightly coloured. There was no physical evidence linking Johnson to any of the scenes of crime or to any property stolen from them. The trial judge, Lord Justice Auld, summed up over four days and at the 2000 ruling it was acknowledged that the summation was \\"a careful, fair and wholly accurate reflection of the evidence and the issues. His directions in law were impeccable. He drew attention to the weaknesses in the prosecution case as well as its strengths. Having directed the jury as to the burden and standard of proof he said: \\"That test is particularly important in a case such as this when so much of the evidence is disputed, where much of the prosecution evidence is itself tainted for one reason or another and where there is considerable uncertainty and inconsistency in important areas.\\"\\" =Other inconsistencies= Rowe has since stated that it had been pointed out that the three key prosecution witnesses: *fitted the victims' descriptions of the assailants *admitted handling and hiding some of the stolen property in premises belonging to Jobbin's girlfriend *admitted stealing the Spitfire *admitted possessing a handgun used by the gang *admitted disposing of the stolen Vauxhall and Renault Until the arrest of Rowe and Davis, the police maintained in their appeals for information that the suspects were two white males and one black male. Appeal Following conviction the defendants appealed. The grounds for appeal were based on *that Johnson had not been identified by anyone including Jobbins, Duncan or Griffin; *the evidence from eyewitnesses about the colour of the attackers; *the unreliability of the witness who testified that Johnson had confessed to him while on remand; *the unreliability of Jobbins, Duncan and Griffin; *the inconsistency between Kate Williamson's evidence and that of the witness who had seen the green Spitfire at the scene of the murder. The appeal was heard on 23 July 1993, and it was then disclosed that reward money had been paid for information leading to the three men's conviction but not the name or names of the recipients, which their lawyers claimed was vital to their case, since those alleged to have received payments might also have been suspects, and had been promised immunity from prosecution in return for information. It later emerged that Norman Duncan had received ¬£10,300 in reward money from the Daily Mail, which was not disclosed to the jury when he gave evidence at the original trial. The appeal was rejected, with the court stating: \\"Taking all the evidence relating to the timing and events on the Thursday night and the succeeding days into account we conclude that, on the whole of the material we have reviewed, there is no basis for saying there is even a lurking doubt about the safety of the convictions of Rowe and Davis, the same applies to Johnson. On the contrary, the case against them all was, and remains, a formidable one.\\" In 1994, Davis and Rowe made an application to the European Court of Human Rights. Criminal Cases Review Commission In 1997 the Criminal Cases Review Commission appointed an investigating officer from Greater Manchester Police to carry out enquiries into the case, and in January 1999 the investigating officer submitted his report. This disclosed that: *Duncan was a registered police informant who had contacted his handler on 18 December 1988 about the crimes *Over two days of questioning, Duncan had alleged that the gang consisted of Rowe, Davis and Jason Cooper, not Johnson *Investigating officers had discussed the possibility of a reward being paid to him at the conclusion of the case *No prosecutions were carried out against Duncan, Griffin, Cooper or Jobbins *Cooper was himself a known burglar with a previous conviction for robbery *The foreman of the jury had visited the site of the murder without the knowledge of the court *There was no evidence to link Johnson to any of the scenes of crime or to any property stolen from them *Witness testimony suggested that at least one of the gang was white *There existed a possibility of the persons responsible for the attack upon Hurburgh and Eley having returned to the bail hostel in the Austin Princess before the same vehicle set off for the Napier's residence with a different team inside The report concluded that: \\"The new evidence and arguments... create a real possibility that Mr Johnson was not one of those three persons. Whilst there is evidence specifically linking Messrs Rowe and Davis to the robberies, if the prosecution against one of the three, Mr Johnson, might no longer be sustainable, in the Commission's view the Court of Appeal ought at the same time have the opportunity to consider whether the case can still be sustained against Messrs Rowe and Davis.\\" ECHR judgment and release On 16 February 2000 the European Court of Human Rights returned its judgment in respect of Davis and Rowe. It found that there had been a violation of Article 6 (1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the failure to disclose Duncan's status as an informant prior to trial together with the fact that he had become eligible for a reward and may have nominated Cooper as one of the robbers before later accusing Johnson. = Release = The hearing commenced on 14 June 2000 and their convictions were overturned after being ruled \\"unsafe\\" by the Court of Appeal.\\"Appeal court frees 'M25 Three'\\". BBC News. 18 July 2000. Retrieved 11 August 2009. On 17 July 2000 the three were released from prison. Lord Justice Mantell, Mr Justice Blofeld and Mrs Justice Rafferty were emphatic that although the convictions were unsafe, they were not declaring the men innocent: \\"The case against all three appellants was formidable. The evidence against Rowe was overwhelming... For the better understanding of those who have listened to this judgment and of those who may report it hereafter this is not a finding of innocence, far from it.\\" On his release, Davis stated that it had been \\"a very long and hard battle to prove my innocence\\", and that they were \\"innocent\\" regardless of what the judges had said. Rowe said: \\"I know the judges were involved in a damage limitation exercise. But what they said was diabolical. They didn't say I was guilty, but that's how everyone interpreted it. I have battled every day of the last 12 years to prove I was set up by the police, to prove I am not a murderer. It has been my passion. I am free now, but it's as if I'm still inside. I'm still trying to get my voice heard.\\" Rowe is currently an investigative journalist working for the BBC. His documentary on the conviction of Barry George for the murder of Jill Dando was considered a significant factor in his eventual acquittal.

A snaplock ignites the (usually muzzle-loading) weapon's propellant by means of sparks produced when a spring-powered cock strikes a flint down on to a piece of hardened steel. The snaplock is therefore similar to the snaphaunce (sometimes classed as an advanced type of snaplock) and the later flintlock (see below). In all snaplocks, the flint is held in a clamp at the end of a bent lever called the cock. When the gun is \\"cocked\\", the cock is held back, against the pressure of a spring, by a catch which is part of the trigger mechanism. When the trigger is pulled, the catch is released and the spring moves the cock rapidly forwards. The flint strikes a curved plate of hardened steel, called the \\"steel\\". The flint strikes from the steel a shower of white hot steel shavings (sparks) which fall towards the priming powder held in the flash pan. The flash from the pan's ignited primer travels (unless there is only a \\"flash in the pan\\") through the touch hole into the firing chamber at the rear of the barrel, and ignites the main charge of gunpowder. Before the weapon is fired, the pan has a closed cover: the mechanism for opening this cover (i.e. manual or automatic) can affect whether the weapon is classed as a snaplock. In fact, the term snaplock may be used in three ways, as follows: * The most general use of snaplock is for any lock which strikes flint against steel but which does not have the defining feature of a true flintlock. This is the frizzen, a single piece of metal which is a combined \\"steel\\" and self- opening pan cover. * A more restrictive definition excludes the snaphaunce, more sophisticated weapons with a lateral sear and a pan cover, separate from the steel, that opens automatically. * Sometimes the term is used only for specific Scandinavian, German, and Russian varieties of lock. Period of use The snaplock first appeared in the late 1540s, probably in southern Germany.Blair 1983:42 It was cheap and easy to produce, and like all post- matchlock weapons, could be primed and loaded in advance and be fired at a moment's notice. It fell out of favor by about 1640, except in Sweden and Russia, where it lasted far longer.Blair 1983:67 Safety Snaplocks as a class did not have safety devices, but individual models could be prevented from inadvertent firing by different mechanisms: * In the early models with a manual pan cover, the steel could be swung out of the path of the flint until just before firing; also, a closed pan cover would not allow the primer to ignite and could help keep the primer dry in misty conditions. * On some models, an external hook attached to the lock plate could engage the tip of the \\"cocked\\" cock to prevent it from moving forwards. Regional varieties include the Baltic Lock, the Russian Snaplock, and the Miquelet lock. The Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus had many matchlock muskets converted to snaplocks during his military reforms.

Despite his piety, Hugh was in constant conflict with the abbey of St. Maixent. On numerous occasions his disputes with the monks grew so violent that the duke of Aquitaine and the bishops of Poitiers and Saintes had to intercede. At one point, Pope Paschal II threatened Hugh with excommunication. From these conflicts Hugh was dubbed \\"le diable\\", the devilish, by the monks of St. Maixent.

It attempts to explain long- run economic growth by looking at capital accumulation, labor or population growth, and increases in productivity, commonly referred to as technological progress. At its core is a neoclassical (aggregate) production function, often specified to be of Cobb‚ÄìDouglas type, which enables the model \\"to make contact with microeconomics\\". The model was developed independently by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in 1956,The idea of using a Cobb‚ÄìDouglas production function at the core of a growth model dates back to . See and superseded the Keynesian Harrod‚ÄìDomar model. Mathematically, the Solow‚ÄìSwan model is a nonlinear system consisting of a single ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the per capita stock of capital. Due to its particularly attractive mathematical characteristics, Solow‚ÄìSwan proved to be a convenient starting point for various extensions. For instance, in 1965, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans integrated Frank Ramsey's analysis of consumer optimization, thereby endogenizing the saving rate, to create what is now known as the Ramsey‚ÄìCass‚ÄìKoopmans model.  Background  The neo- classical model was an extension to the 1946 Harrod‚ÄìDomar model that included a new term: productivity growth. Important contributions to the model came from the work done by Solow and by Swan in 1956, who independently developed relatively simple growth models. Pdf. Solow's model fitted available data on US economic growth with some success. Pdf. In 1987 Solow was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work. Today, economists use Solow's sources-of- growth accounting to estimate the separate effects on economic growth of technological change, capital, and labor. = Extension to the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model = Solow extended the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model by adding labor as a factor of production and capital-output ratios that are not fixed as they are in the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model. These refinements allow increasing capital intensity to be distinguished from technological progress. Solow sees the fixed proportions production function as a \\"crucial assumption\\" to the instability results in the Harrod-Domar model. His own work expands upon this by exploring the implications of alternative specifications, namely the Cobb‚ÄìDouglas and the more general constant elasticity of substitution (CES). Although this has become the canonical and celebrated story in the history of economics, featured in many economic textbooks, recent reappraisal of Harrod's work has contested it. One central criticism is that Harrod's original piece was neither mainly concerned with economic growth nor did he explicitly use a fixed proportions production function. = Long-run implications = A standard Solow model predicts that in the long run, economies converge to their steady state equilibrium and that permanent growth is achievable only through technological progress. Both shifts in saving and in populational growth cause only level effects in the long-run (i.e. in the absolute value of real income per capita). An interesting implication of Solow's model is that poor countries should grow faster and eventually catch-up to richer countries. This convergence could be explained by: * Lags in the diffusion on knowledge. Differences in real income might shrink as poor countries receive better technology and information; * Efficient allocation of international capital flows, since the rate of return on capital should be higher in poorer countries. In practice, this is seldom observed and is known as Lucas' paradox; * A mathematical implication of the model (assuming poor countries have not yet reached their steady state). Baumol attempted to verify this empirically and found a very strong correlation between a countries' output growth over a long period of time (1870 to 1979) and its initial wealth. His findings were later contested by DeLong who claimed that both the non- randomness of the sampled countries, and potential for significant measurement errors for estimates of real income per capita in 1870, biased Baumol's findings. DeLong concludes that there is little evidence to support the convergence theory. = Assumptions = The key assumption of the neoclassical growth model is that capital is subject to diminishing returns in a closed economy. *Given a fixed stock of labor, the impact on output of the last unit of capital accumulated will always be less than the one before. *Assuming for simplicity no technological progress or labor force growth, diminishing returns implies that at some point the amount of new capital produced is only just enough to make up for the amount of existing capital lost due to depreciation. At this point, because of the assumptions of no technological progress or labor force growth, we can see the economy ceases to grow. *Assuming non-zero rates of labor growth complicate matters somewhat, but the basic logic still applies ‚Äì in the short-run, the rate of growth slows as diminishing returns take effect and the economy converges to a constant \\"steady-state\\" rate of growth (that is, no economic growth per-capita). *Including non-zero technological progress is very similar to the assumption of non-zero workforce growth, in terms of \\"effective labor\\": a new steady state is reached with constant output per worker-hour required for a unit of output. However, in this case, per-capita output grows at the rate of technological progress in the \\"steady-state\\" (that is, the rate of productivity growth). = Variations in the effects of productivity = In the Solow‚ÄìSwan model the unexplained change in the growth of output after accounting for the effect of capital accumulation is called the Solow residual. This residual measures the exogenous increase in total factor productivity (TFP) during a particular time period. The increase in TFP is often attributed entirely to technological progress, but it also includes any permanent improvement in the efficiency with which factors of production are combined over time. Implicitly TFP growth includes any permanent productivity improvements that result from improved management practices in the private or public sectors of the economy. Paradoxically, even though TFP growth is exogenous in the model, it cannot be observed, so it can only be estimated in conjunction with the simultaneous estimate of the effect of capital accumulation on growth during a particular time period. The model can be reformulated in slightly different ways using different productivity assumptions, or different measurement metrics: *Average Labor Productivity (ALP) is economic output per labor hour. *Multifactor productivity (MFP) is output divided by a weighted average of capital and labor inputs. The weights used are usually based on the aggregate input shares either factor earns. This ratio is often quoted as: 33% return to capital and 67% return to labor (in Western nations). In a growing economy, capital is accumulated faster than people are born, so the denominator in the growth function under the MFP calculation is growing faster than in the ALP calculation. Hence, MFP growth is almost always lower than ALP growth. (Therefore, measuring in ALP terms increases the apparent capital deepening effect.) MFP is measured by the \\"Solow residual\\", not ALP.  Mathematics of the model  The textbook Solow‚ÄìSwan model is set in continuous-time world with no government or international trade. A single good (output) is produced using two factors of production, labor (L) and capital (K) in an aggregate production function that satisfies the Inada conditions, which imply that the elasticity of substitution must be asymptotically equal to one. : Y(t)=K(t)^\\\\alpha(A(t)L(t))^{1-\\\\alpha}\\\\, where t denotes time, 0 < \\\\alpha < 1 is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, and Y(t) represents total production. A refers to labor-augmenting technology or ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù, thus AL represents effective labor. All factors of production are fully employed, and initial values A(0), K(0), and L(0) are given. The number of workers, i.e. labor, as well as the level of technology grow exogenously at rates n and g, respectively: :L(t) = L(0)e^{nt} :A(t) = A(0)e^{gt} The number of effective units of labor, A(t)L(t), therefore grows at rate (n+g). Meanwhile, the stock of capital depreciates over time at a constant rate \\\\delta. However, only a fraction of the output (cY(t) with 0) is consumed, leaving a saved share s = 1-c for investment. This dynamic is expressed through the following differential equation: :\\\\dot{K}(t) = s \\\\cdot Y(t) - \\\\delta \\\\cdot K(t)\\\\, where \\\\dot{K} is shorthand for \\\\frac{dK(t)}{dt}, the derivative with respect to time. Derivative with respect to time means that it is the change in capital stock‚Äîoutput that is neither consumed nor used to replace worn-out old capital goods is net investment. Since the production function Y(K, AL) has constant returns to scale, it can be written as output per effective unit of labour y, which is a measure for wealth creation:Step-by-step calculation: y(t) = \\\\frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = \\\\frac{K(t)^{\\\\alpha}(A(t)L(t))^{1-\\\\alpha}}{A(t)L(t)} = \\\\frac{K(t)^{\\\\alpha}}{(A(t)L(t))^{\\\\alpha}} = k(t)^{\\\\alpha} :y(t) = \\\\frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = k(t)^\\\\alpha The main interest of the model is the dynamics of capital intensity k, the capital stock per unit of effective labour. Its behaviour over time is given by the key equation of the Solow‚ÄìSwan model:Step-by-step calculation: \\\\dot{k}(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{K}(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \\\\frac{K(t)}{[A(t)L(t)]^2}[A(t)\\\\dot{L}(t)+L(t)\\\\dot{A}(t)] = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{K}(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \\\\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} \\\\frac{\\\\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)} - \\\\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} \\\\frac{\\\\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)}. Since \\\\dot{K}(t) = sY(t) - \\\\delta K(t)\\\\,, and \\\\frac{\\\\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)}, \\\\frac{\\\\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)} are n and g, respectively, the equation simplifies to \\\\dot{k}(t) = s\\\\frac{Y(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - \\\\delta\\\\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - n\\\\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} - g\\\\frac{K(t)}{A(t)L(t)} = sy(t) - \\\\delta k(t) - nk(t) - gk(t). As mentioned above, y(t) = k(t)^\\\\alpha. :\\\\dot{k}(t) = sk(t)^{\\\\alpha} - (n + g + \\\\delta)k(t) The first term, sk(t)^{\\\\alpha} = sy(t), is the actual investment per unit of effective labour: the fraction s of the output per unit of effective labour y(t) that is saved and invested. The second term, (n + g + \\\\delta)k(t), is the ‚Äúbreak-even investment‚Äù: the amount of investment that must be invested to prevent k from falling. The equation implies that k(t) converges to a steady- state value of k^*, defined by sk(t)^{\\\\alpha} = (n + g + \\\\delta)k(t), at which there is neither an increase nor a decrease of capital intensity: :k^* = \\\\left( \\\\frac{s}{n + g + \\\\delta} \\\\right)^{1/(1-\\\\alpha)} \\\\, at which the stock of capital K and effective labour AL are growing at rate (n + g). Likewise, it is possible to calculate the steady-state of created wealth y^* that corresponds with k^*: :y^* = \\\\left( \\\\frac{s}{n + g + \\\\delta} \\\\right)^{\\\\alpha/(1-\\\\alpha)} \\\\, By assumption of constant returns, output Y is also growing at that rate. In essence, the Solow‚ÄìSwan model predicts that an economy will converge to a balanced-growth equilibrium, regardless of its starting point. In this situation, the growth of output per worker is determined solely by the rate of technological progress. Since, by definition, \\\\frac{K(t)}{Y(t)} = k(t)^{1-\\\\alpha} , at the equilibrium k^* we have :\\\\frac{K(t)}{Y(t)} = \\\\frac{s}{n + g + \\\\delta} Therefore, at the equilibrium, the capital/output ratio depends only on the saving, growth, and depreciation rates. This is the Solow‚ÄìSwan model's version of the golden rule saving rate. Since {\\\\alpha}<1, at any time t the marginal product of capital K(t) in the Solow‚ÄìSwan model is inversely related to the capital/labor ratio. :MPK=\\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial K}= \\\\frac{\\\\alpha A^{1-\\\\alpha}}{(K/L)^{1-\\\\alpha}} If productivity A is the same across countries, then countries with less capital per worker K/L have a higher marginal product, which would provide a higher return on capital investment. As a consequence, the model predicts that in a world of open market economies and global financial capital, investment will flow from rich countries to poor countries, until capital/worker K/L and income/worker Y/L equalize across countries. Since the marginal product of physical capital is not higher in poor countries than in rich countries, the implication is that productivity is lower in poor countries. The basic Solow model cannot explain why productivity is lower in these countries. Lucas suggested that lower levels of human capital in poor countries could explain the lower productivity. If one equates the marginal product of capital \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial K} with the rate of return r (such approximation is often used in neoclassical economics), then, for our choice of the production function : \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{K\\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial K}}{Y} = \\\\frac{rK}{Y} \\\\, so that \\\\alpha is the fraction of income appropriated by capital. Thus, Solow‚ÄìSwan model assumes from the beginning that the labor-capital split of income remains constant.  Mankiw‚ÄìRomer‚ÄìWeil version of model  = Addition of human capital = N. Gregory Mankiw, David Romer, and David Weil created a human capital augmented version of the Solow‚ÄìSwan model that can explain the failure of international investment to flow to poor countries. In this model output and the marginal product of capital (K) are lower in poor countries because they have less human capital than rich countries. Similar to the textbook Solow‚ÄìSwan model, the production function is of Cobb‚ÄìDouglas type: : Y(t) = K(t)^\\\\alpha H(t)^\\\\beta (A(t)L(t))^{1 - \\\\alpha - \\\\beta}, where H(t) is the stock of human capital, which depreciates at the same rate \\\\delta as physical capital. For simplicity, they assume the same function of accumulation for both types of capital. Like in Solow‚ÄìSwan, a fraction of the outcome, sY(t), is saved each period, but in this case split up and invested partly in physical and partly in human capital, such that s = s_K + s_H. Therefore, there are two fundamental dynamic equations in this model: :\\\\dot{k} = s_K k^\\\\alpha h^\\\\beta - (n + g + \\\\delta)k :\\\\dot{h} = s_H k^\\\\alpha h^\\\\beta - (n + g + \\\\delta)h The balanced (or steady-state) equilibrium growth path is determined by \\\\dot{k} = \\\\dot{h} = 0, which means s_K k^\\\\alpha h^\\\\beta - (n + g + \\\\delta)k = 0 and s_H k^\\\\alpha h^\\\\beta - (n + g + \\\\delta)h = 0. Solving for the steady-state level of k and h yields: :k^* = \\\\left( \\\\frac{s_K^{1 - \\\\beta} s_H^\\\\beta}{n + g + \\\\delta} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{1- \\\\alpha- \\\\beta}} :h^* = \\\\left( \\\\frac{s_K^\\\\alpha s_H^{1- \\\\alpha}}{n + g + \\\\delta} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{1- \\\\alpha- \\\\beta}} In the steady state, y^{*} = (k^{*})^\\\\alpha (h^{*})^\\\\beta. = Econometric estimates = Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare cast doubt on the validity of the augmented model because Mankiw, Romer, and Weil's estimates of {\\\\beta} did not seem consistent with accepted estimates of the effect of increases in schooling on workers' salaries. Though the estimated model explained 78% of variation in income across countries, the estimates of {\\\\beta} implied that human capital's external effects on national income are greater than its direct effect on workers' salaries. = Accounting for external effects = Theodore Breton provided an insight that reconciled the large effect of human capital from schooling in the Mankiw, Romer and Weil model with the smaller effect of schooling on workers' salaries. He demonstrated that the mathematical properties of the model include significant external effects between the factors of production, because human capital and physical capital are multiplicative factors of production. The external effect of human capital on the productivity of physical capital is evident in the marginal product of physical capital: :MPK=\\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial K}= \\\\frac{\\\\alpha A^{1-\\\\alpha}(H/L)^\\\\beta}{(K/L)^{1-\\\\alpha}} He showed that the large estimates of the effect of human capital in cross-country estimates of the model are consistent with the smaller effect typically found on workers' salaries when the external effects of human capital on physical capital and labor are taken into account. This insight significantly strengthens the case for the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil version of the Solow‚ÄìSwan model. Most analyses criticizing this model fail to account for the pecuniary external effects of both types of capital inherent in the model. = Total factor productivity = The exogenous rate of TFP (total factor productivity) growth in the Solow‚ÄìSwan model is the residual after accounting for capital accumulation. The Mankiw, Romer, and Weil model provide a lower estimate of the TFP (residual) than the basic Solow‚ÄìSwan model because the addition of human capital to the model enables capital accumulation to explain more of the variation in income across countries. In the basic model, the TFP residual includes the effect of human capital because human capital is not included as a factor of production.  Conditional convergence  The Solow‚ÄìSwan model augmented with human capital predicts that the income levels of poor countries will tend to catch up with or converge towards the income levels of rich countries if the poor countries have similar savings rates for both physical capital and human capital as a share of output, a process known as conditional convergence. However, savings rates vary widely across countries. In particular, since considerable financing constraints exist for investment in schooling, savings rates for human capital are likely to vary as a function of cultural and ideological characteristics in each country. Since the 1950s, output/worker in rich and poor countries generally has not converged, but those poor countries that have greatly raised their savings rates have experienced the income convergence predicted by the Solow‚ÄìSwan model. As an example, output/worker in Japan, a country which was once relatively poor, has converged to the level of the rich countries. Japan experienced high growth rates after it raised its savings rates in the 1950s and 1960s, and it has experienced slowing growth of output/worker since its savings rates stabilized around 1970, as predicted by the model. The per-capita income levels of the southern states of the United States have tended to converge to the levels in the Northern states. The observed convergence in these states is also consistent with the conditional convergence concept. Whether absolute convergence between countries or regions occurs depends on whether they have similar characteristics, such as: * Education policy * Institutional arrangements * Free markets internally, and trade policy with other countries. Additional evidence for conditional convergence comes from multivariate, cross-country regressions. Econometric analysis on Singapore and the other \\"East Asian Tigers\\" has produced the surprising result that although output per worker has been rising, almost none of their rapid growth had been due to rising per-capita productivity (they have a low \\"Solow residual\\").

He is known for the introduction of the Prairie Style to the Caribbean and the integration of Arts and Crafts elements to his architecture. Nechodoma designed in such style at the historical district of Miramar, Puerto Rico where the town preserves his creation. Biography Antonin Nechodoma was born in Prague (then part of Bohemia) in 1877. In 1887, Nechodoma's family emigrated to Chicago where he worked as a contractor. In 1905, Nechodoma, already an architect, arrived in Puerto Rico after working for a short period in Florida. In Puerto Rico (1905‚Äì1928), Nechodoma became one of the most prominent architects in the Caribbean. His work included private and public buildings: banks, schools, markets, churches and houses. His practice extended to the Dominican Republic where he built the main 'glorieta' in the Parque Independencia in Santo Domingo and the Market in San Pedro de Macoris. Nechodoma's work has been surrounded by controversy. His architectural style varied widely, from Neo- Classical Style for public school buildings, Gothic and Mission Style for his churches and Prairie Style in his houses. The most controversial aspect of Nechodoma's work has been his plagiarism of Frank Lloyd Wright's residential work. Architectural historians Jorge Rigau, Enrique Vivoni Farage, and Nechodoma's biographer, Thomas Marvel have discussed extensively Nechodoma's direct use of Wright's Wasmuth Portfolio as a reference for his residential work in Puerto Rico. Despite the controversy, Nechodoma made significant contributions to the architecture of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. His integration of arts and crafts motifs to his architecture, ranging from furniture design, ironwork, stained glass, and mosaics, had an enormous influence in the Caribbean architecture of the early 20th century. His prolific production left a wealth of first class public buildings in both the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, notable because of their technical innovations and their contribution toward forming a language of tropical architecture in the Caribbean. Nechodoma's work was published extensively during his lifetime. He also published in 1927 an important article on architecture in Puerto Rico entitled \\"Concerning Architecture in Puerto Rico\\".

KaNgwane ceased to exist on 27 April 1994 when the Interim Constitution dissolved the homelands and created new provinces. Its territory became part of the province of Mpumalanga. History Grand Apartheid in Formation: A Brief History of KaNgwane The Swazi Territorial Authority was established at Tonga in the Nkomazi Region on 23 April 1976 by the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs, Development and Education, Dr F. Hartzenberg (who read the speech on behalf of the then Member of Parliament and Minister of Bantu Affairs, Mr M.C. Botha). It was established, Pretoria claimed, to cater for the interests of the Swazis within the borders of the Republic of South Africa. The first leader of the Swazi Territorial Authority administration was Chief J.M. Dhlamini of the Embhuleni Royal Kraal in Badplaas (to whom I later, in 1981, served as private secretary). The establishment of the Authority was preceded by disruptive events. In 1975, the forced removals of the people from Kromkrans, Doringkop and elsewhere, in the so-called black spots in white areas, to settlements like Kromdraai (Ekulindeni) started. In 1976, the majority of the people from Kromkrans were settled on the farm Eerstehoek, my birth place. They were dumped on our fields and grazing land. The plans for the establishment of the Swazi ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô continued, and in October 1977, the Swazi Territorial Authority elected the late Dr E.J. Mabuza to become the Chief Executive Councillor of the ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô. The ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô from there was named KaNgwane (a name, it should be added, that the authorities in Swaziland did not have a problem with). Contrasts: KaNgwane and the Inyandza National Movement The Inyandza National Movement was the governing party of the then KaNgwane ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô government. It was founded in October 1978 at Lochiel, a village with no more than a filling station a few kilometres from the Oshoek border post. It became a critical driving force of politics. It was through the Inyandza National Movement that KaNgwane contrasted with other ‚Äòhomelands‚Äô and refused independence. Inyandza was formed instead to politicise and mobilise the masses of our people in furtherance of the aims and objectives of the liberation movement: on the one hand, through its relationships with the ANC in exile; and, on the other, through its socio-economic development programme, through which it sought to uplift the standard of living of the ‚Äòcitizens‚Äô of that ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô. After the late Dr Enos J. Mabuza assumed office of Chief Executive Councillor of the ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô, negotiations to be granted the second phase of the ‚Äòhomeland‚Äôs‚Äô development, i.e. self-governing status, began. The leadership of KaNgwane had already repeatedly indicated that the people of KaNgwane were against so-called independence. The apartheid government of South Africa was however reluctant to grant the self-governing status to KaNgwane. They wanted to do so on condition that KaNgwane thereafter opt for Pretoria's offer of independence. The leadership of KaNgwane refused to accept such a condition, and request after request for self-governing status received no positive responses from Pretoria. Pretoria sought to punish KaNgwane for its refusal to co-operate with plans to make ‚Äòhomelands‚Äô independent, and KaNgwane began to experience extreme under-funding. But the Inyandza National Movement had politicised the people. Weekly prayer meetings and rallies were organised. The leadership of the Inyandza National Movement intensified the call for the unbanning of the ANC and other political organisations. We rejected Pretoria's independence completely. The people were mobilised so that when Pretoria refused to grant self-governing status to KaNgwane, they stood up and defended their rights. They did not stand up because they believed in the ‚Äòhomelands‚Äô. They never desired to opt for independence but to fight until South Africa became free from the shackles of apartheid. That is why the capital of KaNgwane in Louieville was just a temporary structure. We did not see any point in building massive and magnificent structures. After some time without responding at all to the intensified mobilisation, the government of South Africa found another way to force independence on KaNgwane: it announced the incorporation of KaNgwane territory and Ingwavuma region of the then ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô of KwaZulu into the Kingdom of Swaziland, the so-called land deal between the government of the Republic of South Africa and the Kingdom of Swaziland.

It is valued for its edible green seed pods. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of West African, Ethiopian, and South Asian origins. The plant is cultivated in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions around the world. Etymology 'Abelmoschus' is New Latin from Arabic ÿ£Ÿéÿ®ŸèŸà ÿßŸÑŸÖŸêÿ≥ŸíŸÉ‚Äé ( æab≈´ l-misk, ‚Äúfather of musk‚Äù). 'esculentus' is Latin for being fit for human consumption. The first use of the word okra (Alternatively; okro or ochro) appeared on 1679 in the Colony of Virginia, deriving from the Igbo word . The word gumbo was first recorded to be used in American vernacular around 1805, deriving from Louisiana Creole, but originates from either the Umbundu word ochingg√¥mbo or the Kimbundu word ki- ngombo. Despite the fact that in most of the United States the word gumbo often refers to the dish, gumbo, many places in the Deep South still use it to refer to the pods and plant as well as many other variants of the word found across the African diaspora in the Americas.  Origin and distribution  Whole plant with blossom and immature pod Okra is an allopolyploid of uncertain parentage. However, proposed parents include Abelmoschus ficulneus, A. tuberculatus and a reported \\"diploid\\" form of okra. Truly wild (as opposed to naturalised) populations are not known with certainty, and the species may be a cultigen. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of South Asian, Ethiopian and West African origins. The Egyptians and Moors of the 12th and 13th centuries used the Arabic word for the plant, bamya, suggesting it had come into Egypt from Arabia, but earlier it was probably taken from Ethiopia to Arabia. The plant may have entered southwest Asia across the Red Sea or the Bab-el-Mandeb straight to the Arabian Peninsula, rather than north across the Sahara, or from India. One of the earliest accounts is by a Spanish Moor who visited Egypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender, young pods with meal. From Arabia, the plant spread around the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and eastward. The plant was introduced to the Americas by ships plying the Atlantic slave trade\\" Okra gumbo and rice\\" by Sheila S. Walker, The News Courier, unknown date by 1658, when its presence was recorded in Brazil. It was further documented in Suriname in 1686. Okra may have been introduced to southeastern North America from Africa in the early 18th century. By 1748, it was being grown as far north as Philadelphia. Thomas Jefferson noted it was well established in Virginia by 1781. It was commonplace throughout the Southern United States by 1800, and the first mention of different cultivars was in 1806.  Botany and cultivation  Okra plant pollen Latitudinal cross- section of the okra pod The species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates, often growing to around tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is related to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are long and broad, palmately lobed with 5‚Äì7 lobes. The flowers are in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The pollens are spherical with approximately 188 microns diameter. The fruit is a capsule up to long with pentagonal cross- section, containing numerous seeds. Abelmoschus esculentus is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. It is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world and will tolerate soils with heavy clay and intermittent moisture, but frost can damage the pods. In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of . It prefers a soil temperature of at least for germination which occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. Seedlings require ample water. The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a vegetable, must be harvested when immature, usually within a week after pollination. Okra is available in two varieties, green and red. Red okra carries the same flavor as the more popular green okra and differs only in color. When cooked, the red okra pods turn green. The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is verticillium wilt, often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other diseases include powdery mildew in dry tropical regions, leaf spots, and root-knot nematodes.  Food and uses  Stir-fried okra with diced chili peppers The products of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic \\"goo\\" or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble fiber. One possible way to de-slime okra is to cook it with an acidic food, such as tomatoes, to render the mucilage less viscous. Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. Okra may be used in developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity. = Nutrition = Raw okra is 90% water, 2% protein, 7% carbohydrates and negligible in fat. In a 100 gram amount, raw okra is rich (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) in dietary fiber, vitamin C and vitamin K, with moderate contents of thiamin, folate and magnesium (table). = Leaves and seeds = Young okra leaves may be cooked in a similar way to the greens of beets or dandelions, or in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for coffee. When importation of coffee was disrupted by the American Civil War in 1861, the Austin State Gazette said, \\"An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a plantation with coffee in every way equal to that imported from Rio.\\"Austin State Gazette [TEX.], November 9, 1861, p. 4, c. 2, copied in Confederate Coffee Substitutes: Articles from Civil War Newspapers , University of Texas at Tyler Greenish- yellow edible okra oil is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as oleic acid and linoleic acid. The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794 kg/ha, the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial. A 1920 study found that a sample contained 15% oil. A 2009 study found okra oil suitable for use as a biofuel. = Industrial uses = Bast fibre from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the reinforcement of polymer composites. The mucilage produced by the okra plant can be used for the removal of turbidity from wastewater by virtue of its flocculent properties. Having composition similar to a thick polysaccharide film, okra mucilage is under development as a biodegradable food packaging, as of 2018.

The Ashtamangala is a sacred suite of Eight Auspicious Signs endemic to a number of religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. The symbols or \\"symbolic attributes\\" () are yidam and teaching tools. Not only do these attributes (or energetic signatures) point to qualities of enlightened mindstream, but they are the investiture that ornaments these enlightened \\"qualities\\" (Sanskrit: gu·πáa; ). Many cultural enumerations and variations of the Ashtamangala are extant. Carved wooden door with 8 auspicious signs (Ashtamangala) in Nepal  In Buddhism  Tibetan Buddhists make use of a particular set of eight auspicious symbols, ashtamangala, in household and public art. Some common interpretations are given along with each symbol although different teachers may give different interpretations: = Conch = ≈öa·πÖkha The right-turning white conch shell (Sanskrit: ; ) represents the beautiful, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of the dharma, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare for the welfare of others. In Hinduism, the conch is an attribute of Vishnu along with the Sudarshana Chakra. Vaishnavism holds that Gautama Buddha is an avatar of Vishnu. = Endless knot = Endless knot The endless knot (Sanskrit: ≈õrƒ´vatsa; )Source: Dpal be'u denotes \\"the auspicious mark represented by a curled noose emblematic of love\\".Sarat Chandra Das (1902). Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms. Calcutta, India: mainly used in buddhismBengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.69 It is a symbol of the ultimate unity of everything. Moreover, it represents the intertwining of wisdom and compassion, the mutual dependence of religious doctrine and secular affairs, the union of wisdom and method, the inseparability of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ \\"emptiness\\" and pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda \\"interdependent origination\\", and the union of wisdom and compassion in enlightenment (see namkha). This knot, net or web metaphor also conveys the Buddhist teaching of interpenetration. = Pair of Golden Fish = Pair of golden fish The two golden fish (Sanskrit: gaurmatsya; Source: gser nya) symbolise the auspiciousness of all sentient beings in a state of fearlessness without danger of drowning in sa·πÉsƒÅra. The two golden fishes are linked with the Ganges and Yamuna nadi, prana and carp: In Islam the (alive) fish has a significant role in the meeting between Moses and Khidr. = Lotus = padma. The lotus flower (Sanskrit: padma; ), represent the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The lotus symbolizes purity and renunciation. Although the lotus has its roots in the mud at the bottom of a pond, its flower lies immaculate above the water. The Buddhist lotus bloom has 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 100, or 1,000 petals. The same figures can refer to the body's 'internal lotuses', that is to say, its energy centres (chakra). = Parasol = Jewelled parasol The jewelled parasol (Sanskrit: chatraratna; ), which is similar in ritual function to the baldachin or canopy: represents the protection of beings from harmful forces and illness. It represents the canopy or firmament of the sky and therefore the expansiveness and unfolding of space and the element √¶ther. It represents the expansiveness, unfolding and protective quality of the sahasrara: all take refuge in the dharma under the auspiciousness of the parasol. = Vase = Treasure vase The treasure vase () represents health, longevity, wealth, prosperity, wisdom and the phenomenon of space. The treasure vase, or pot, symbolizes the Buddha's infinite quality of teaching the dharma: no matter how many teachings he shared, the treasure never lessened. The iconography representation of the treasure vase is often very similar to the kumbha, one of the few possessions permitted a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni in Theravada Buddhism. The wisdom urn or treasure vase is used in many empowerment (Vajrayana) and initiations. = Dharmachakra = The dharmachakra The Dharmachakra or \\"Wheel of the Law\\" (Sanskrit; ) represents Gautama Buddha and the Dharma teaching. This symbol is commonly used by Tibetan Buddhists, where it sometimes also includes an inner wheel of the Gankyil (Tibetan). Nepalese Buddhists don't use the Wheel of Law in the eight auspicious symbols. Instead of the Dharmachakra, a fly-whisk may be used as one of the Ashtamangala to symbolize Tantric manifestations. It is made of a yak's tail attached to a silver staff, and used in ritual recitation and during fanning the deities in pujas. Prayer wheels take the form of a Dharmachakra guise. The Sudarshana Chakra is a Hindu wheel-symbol. = Victory Banner = Dhvaja The dhvaja (Sanskrit; ) \\"banner, flag\\" was a military standard of ancient Indian warfare. The symbol represents the Buddha's victory over the four mƒÅras, or hindrances in the path of enlightenment. These hindrances are pride, desire, disturbing emotions, and the fear of death. Within the Tibetan tradition, a list of eleven different forms of the victory banner is given to represent eleven specific methods for overcoming defilement. Many variations of the dhvaja's design can be seen on the roofs of Tibetan monasteries to symbolise the Buddha's victory over four mƒÅras. Banners are placed at the four corners of monastery and temple roofs. The cylindrical banners placed on monastery roofs are often made of beaten copper. = Sequences of symbols = Different traditions order the eight symbols differently. Here is the sequential order of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of Nepali Buddhism: # Endless knot # Lotus flower # Dhvaja # Dharmachakra (fly- whisk in Nepali Buddhism) # Bumpa # Golden Fish # Parasol # Conch The sequential order for Chinese Buddhism was definedZhou Lili. \\"A Summary of Porcelains' Religious and Auspicious Designs.\\" The Bulletin of the Shanghai Museum 7 (1996), p.133 in the Qing dynasty as: # Dharmachakra # Conch # Dhvaja # Parasol # Lotus flower # Bumpa # Golden Fish # Endless knot  Hindu symbols  In Indian and Hindu tradition,Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () by Anna Dallapiccola the Ashtamangala may be used during certain occasions including: pujas, weddings (of Hindus), and coronations. The ashtamangala finds wide mention in the texts associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. They have been depicted in decorative motifs and cultural artifacts. * The Hindu tradition lists them as: ** lion called raja ** bull called vrishaba ** serpent called naga ** pitcher called kalasa ** necklace called vijayanti ** kettle called bher ** fan called vyajana ** lamp called deepa * The Hindu tradition lists them as: ** fly-whisk ** full vase ** mirror ** elephant goad ** drum ** lamp ** flag ** a pair of fish. * The list also differs depending on the place, region, and the social groups.

Its transmitter is also located on campus. CiTR is operated by UBC students and community volunteers under the ownership of the Student Radio Society of the University of British Columbia, an entity closely affiliated with UBC's Alma Mater Society. The station's mandate is to provide programming that is alternative to the genres played on mainstream radio. Broadcasting at FM 101.9, its signal encompasses most of the Vancouver Metropolitan Area. Notable or long-running programmers include Nardwuar the Human Serviette, Steve Edge, Gavin Walker of the Jazz Show, \\"Long\\" John Tanner, DJ Ebony, DJ Avi Shack, Val Cormier, Luke Meat, Chris-a-riffic, Ska-T, Zena Sharman, Tod Maffin, Bryce Dunn, Jonathon Brown, Spike Chilton of the Northern Wish and the Canadian Way, Bleek Swinney of Exquisite Corpse and Breakfast With The Browns, Pyra Draculea of the Vampire's Ball, Marie Benard of Synchronicity, Caroline of Sexy In VanCity, and many others. CiTR launched a podcast service in September 2006, allowing listeners to access past shows online. CITR is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association, and hosted the National Campus and Community Radio Conference in 1984 and again in 2007. The NCRC is an annual national gathering of community-oriented radio broadcasters who provide alternative radio to a diverse audience. It has been offered every summer since 1981, and it is one of the core activities of the NCRA/ANREC.  History  In 1937, Ozzie Durkin, Dorwin Baird, Victor Freeman, and Malcolm Brown began a variety show called \\"Varsity Time\\" on CJOR. Then, in 1938 UBC Radio became an official club on campus. In 1942, UBC Radio becomes RADSOC and continues to produce radio programming for CJOR, CKWX-AM, CBR, and CKMO. By 1947, UBC Radio had earned a place in the ultra-new facilities in UBC's Brock Hall. In 1949, the budding radio coming out of RADSOC was put on hold after overspending and a bungled radio talent show. The members of RADSOC returned to their station in the fall to discover the doors locked. President Don Cunliffe reinstated RADSOC with no budget and the society continued to broadcast one hour daily despite their financial hardship. A resilient RADSOC partnered with CKWX (BC Association of Broadcasters) to operate a twenty-two-week-long school for commercial radio. Closed-circuit broadcasts to residences begin, and the first full commercials are run on UBC Radio. Nearly twenty years later, in 1969, RADSOC moved into state of the art broadcasting facilities in the newly completed Student Union Building (now the Old SUB) and officially becomes CYVR. True to spirit, CYVR was shut down by the UBC Alma Mater Society for six months for operating without a licence. CYVR had applied for a licence in compliance with CRTC regulations, but continued to broadcast before the licence was approved. When the licence was approved, UBC Radio became Thunderbird Radio: CiTR. Then, in 1975, CiTR began broadcasting at 101.9 MHz. By 1981, CiTR had become an AMS service organization and began to work with the community both on and off campus for the first time since the 1940s. CiTR joined the National Campus Radio Organization, which later became the NCRA. From this affiliation, CiTR was able to make connections with University of Alberta Radio and reform the Western Association of Broadcasters, a Western Canadian campus support and information group that had disbanded twenty years earlier. On April 1, 1982, CiTR broadcast for the first time at 101.9 FM after receiving approval from the CTRC for their Low Power FM licence the previous September. The first song played was \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. Discorder hit the streets in 1983. In 1985, CiTR proposed a unique licensing plan using a directional radio antenna to allow the use of 101.9 MHz simultaneously in Vancouver and Victoria. In that same year, Discorder was chosen by Seattle's Rocket Magazine as one of the Top 20 Publications in the World. Subsequently, in 1988, Discorder was a finalist in the Western Canadian Magazine Awards competition for both Magazine of the Year (circulation under 20 000) and Cover of the Year (50th issue cover, March '87). CiTR went high power to 1800 watts in 1989. The first song played was \\"Have Not Been the Same\\" by Slow. 1990 saw the beginning of CiTR's historical participation in the Vancouver Hip Hop scene with DJ Soundwar Chapter One, a rap competition that saw entrants come from as far away as LA. In 1995, CiTR would go on to publish Elements, a magazine that focuses on local and international Hip Hop culture: MCs, DJs, Breaking, and Graffiti. Elements is only published until 1996. In 1993, CiTR broadcast BBC world news for satellite and, in 1994, CiTR became the first radio station in Vancouver to hit the internet with an email address and gopher site. By 2000 the station was live broadcasting on the web in concert with the broadcast at 101.9 FM. In 2001, the CRTC mandated an incorporation of French and third language programming on the CiTR airwaves. This move towards diversifying content continued through to the following decade. The station began broadcasting content produced by the newly formed Women's Collective, Indigenous Collective, and Accessibility Collective which joined the standard News, Arts, and Sports Collectives on the air in 2014. Discorder Magazine Discorder was created in February 1983 by founding editors Jennifer Fahrni and Mike Mines as an alternative music magazine for Vancouver and the program guide for CiTR. With a circulation of 25,000, the first issue included an interview with Stan Ridgeway of Wall of Voodoo by Mark Mushet; article Youth Culture in West Berlin by Werner Janke; reviews of albums by The Scissors, Los Popularos, and Modernettes by Gord Badanic, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wall of Voodoo, and Mission of Burma by Dave McDonagh, DOA by Dean Pelkey; and a review of the compilation tape Egghead by Brent Argo. The magazine has since expanded to become a media institution in its own right, running music reviews, book reviews, interviews, essay-length articles, comics, a mixtape, the CiTR program guide, and CiTR's charts. Discorder also serves as an outlet for emerging Vancouver music writers, photographers, and illustrators. Issues of Discorder have been digitized by the UBC Library and are available at the UBC Library Open Collections site. Discorder prints 8,000 copies each month and distributes them across the cities of Vancouver and Victoria. =Past editors= Discorder's staff rotates on a regular basis. Each editor's personal style is often reflected in stylistic shifts in the magazine's aesthetics and content. *2018‚Äìpresent: Mallory Amirault *September 2015 ‚Äì 2018: Brit Bachmann *2015: Alex de Boer *2013‚Äì2015: Jacey Gibb *2012-2013: Laurel Borrowman *2011‚Äì2012: Gregory Adams *2008‚Äì2011: Jordie Yow *2008: Nat Jay *2007: Spike Chilton *2006: David Ravensbergen *2003-2005: Kat Siddle *January 2003: Duncan M.

The magazine was edited by J Swing and Mr. Flipout and featured crass copy and near perpetual late publication. The magazine reported on, reviewed, and documented Hip Hop music and culture within Vancouver while tying the city's scene to the goings-on of the American Hip Hop phenomenon. Featured artist included KRS-One, Group Home, Ghostface Killah, A Tribe Called Quest, Outkast, and Busta Rhymes. SHiNDiG SHiNDiG is a long-running battle of the bands competition hosted by CiTR yearly from September to December. Past contestants have included bands such as 3 Inches of Blood, Speedbuggy, The Organ, Japandroids, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, You Say Party! We Say Die!, The Choir Practice, Maow, Collapsing Opposites, Herm√©tica and The Salteens. Sports CiTR provides coverage of the UBC Thunderbirds varsity teams. The sports department produces live coverage of many sporting events during the academic year, such as football, ice hockey, basketball and volleyball. The station has also carried baseball and soccer broadcasts. CiTR has produced live broadcasts at recent Canadian Interuniversity Sport national tournaments: men's basketball (2009); women's basketball (2004‚Äì2008); men's soccer (2007); women's field hockey (2005). The station won the Arthur W. Delamont Service Award in 1983 and 1987 for their contribution and service to UBC athletics. News CiTR has a news department, which produces News 101, a live, volunteer-produced, student and community newscast. The news department provides original coverage of local, provincial, federal, and international news, from an independent perspective. The news department does not cover crime or other sensationalized news stories, choosing instead to cover politics, social justice and environment topics. News 101 is broadcast once- weekly, on Fridays at 5pm PST. CiTR News produced a special series covering the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, including a special 'Eyes on the Street' segment. CiTR News also produced notable coverage of the APEC protests at UBC in 1997.http://quadrantcrossing.org/sound/CiTR_ApecRadio_1997.mp3  Archives  Archives of 585 recordings of CiTR broadcasts can be found at the University of British Columbia \\"CiTR Audiotapes\\" archive.

Born circa 1200, presumably (from the nisba al‚Äê øUr·∏çƒ´) in the village of  øUr·∏ç in the Syrian desert between Palmyra and Resafa, he came to Damascus at some point before 1239, where he worked as an engineer and teacher of geometry, and built instruments for al- Malik al-Mansur of Hims. In 1259 he moved to Maragha in northeastern Iran, after being asked by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi to help establish the Maragha observatory under the patronage of Hulagu. (PDF version) Al-Urdi's most notable works are RisƒÅlat al-Ra·π£d, a treatise on observational instruments, and KitƒÅb al-Hay æa (ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑŸáŸäÿ¶ÿ©), a work on theoretical astronomy. His influence can be seen on Bar Hebraeus and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, in addition to being quoted by Ibn al-Shatir. Al-Urdi contributed to the construction of the observatory outside of the city, constructing special devices and water wheels in order to supply the observatory, which was built on a hill, with drinking water. He also constructed some of the instruments used in the observatory, in the year 1261/2. Al-Urdi's son, who also worked in the observatory, made a copy of his father's KitƒÅb al‚ÄêHay æa and also constructed a celestial globe in 1279.This globe was bought by Augustus, Elector of Saxony in 1562 and since then has been kept in Dresden (now in Mathematisch- Physikalischer Salon).

Al-Urdi is a member of the group of Islamic astronomers of the 13th and 14th centuries who were active in the criticism of the astronomical model presented in Ptolemy's Almagest. Saliba (1979) identified Bodleian ms. Marsh 621 as a copy of Al-Urdi's KitƒÅb al-Hay æa, based on which he argued that Al-Urdi's contributions predated Al-Tusi. Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957 argued that the works of this group of astronomers, perhaps via Ibn al-Shatir, must have been received in 15th-century Europe and ultimately influenced the works of Copernicus. This concerns the \\"Urdi lemma\\" in particular, an extension of Apollonius' theorem that allowed an equant in an astronomic model to be replaced with an equivalent epicycle that moved around a deferent centered at half the distance to the equant point.

Lysorophians resembled small snakes, as their bodies are extremely elongate. There is a single family, the Molgophidae (previously known as Lysorophidae). Currently there are around five genera included within Lysorophia, although many may not be valid.  Description  274x274px The skull is heavily built but with large lateral openings to accommodate jaw musculature, with small orbits restricted to the anterior edge of the large fenestrae. The intertemporal, supratemporal, postfrontal, and jugal bones of the skull have disappeared. The mandibles are short and robust with a small number of large triangular teeth. Although it was initially thought that the maxilla and premaxilla were freely movable, detailed anatomical studies show that this is not the case. The braincase is extremely robust, suggesting that lysorophians may have engaged in headfirst burrowing. The torso is very elongate, the limbs diminutive or absent, and the tail short. There are up to 99 pre-sacral (i.e. not including the hips and tail) vertebrae. Based on morphology of the cranio-vertebral articulation and internal structure of the head, lysorophians are usually considered to be related to the Microsauria, although the pattern of bones of the skull is somewhat different. Distribution Lysorophians are known mainly from the Pennsylvanian and Early Permian of North America. In North America, fossils of lysorophians have been found from places such as the Cutler Formation in San Juan County, Utah and the Mazon Creek fossil beds in Grundy County, Illinois. Carboniferous lysorophians are also known from Europe, having been found from England and Ireland. Possible remains of a lysorophian have also been found from La Machine, France, although they may belong to an a√Østopod.  Paleoecology  Swim traces referrable to lysorophians have been found at the Robledo mountains of New Mexico, an area famous for its Permian tetrapod trackways. Designated as the ichnogenus Serpentichnus, these marks occur as a series of L-shaped grooves, which are divided into two shafts: a long, diagonal shaft preceded by a shorter, forward-pointing shaft offset at a 150% angle. What seem to be tiny foot impressions occur on either side of the series of groves. When originally described in 2003, Serpentichnus tracks were argued to have been formed by a long-bodied animal with small limbs, moving in a \\"sidewinding\\" motion along a riverbed. Lysorophians such as Brachydectes were considered to be the most likely candidates for these swim traces. However, some paleontologists have argued that Serpentichnus traces were not actually formed by animals.These sources argue that the grooves were \\"tool marks\\", meaning that they were formed by rocks or vegetation brushing against the riverbed while being carried by a current.

He was a professor of medieval history at Princeton from 1933 to 1937, and at Stanford from 1937 to 1943. He was president of Mills College, Oakland, from 1943 to 1958 and a professor at University of California, Los Angeles from 1958 until 1987. Lynn White helped to found the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) and was president from 1960 to 1962. He won the Pfizer Award for \\"Medieval Technology and Social Change\\" from the History of Science Society (HSS) and the Leonardo da Vinci medal and Dexter prize from SHOT in 1964 and 1970. He was president of the History of Science Society from 1971 to 1972.The History of Science Society \\"The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society\\" , accessed 4 December 2013 He was president of The Medieval Academy of America from 1972‚Äì1973, and the American Historical Association in 1973. Biography White began his career as medieval historian focusing on the history of Latin monasticism in Sicily during the Norman Period but realized the coming conflict in Europe would interfere with his access to source materials. While at Princeton he read the works of Richard Lefebvre des No√´ttes, and Marc Bloch. This led to his first work in the history of technology, \\"Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages\\" in 1940. Noettes was a retired French cavalry officer who made his hobby the history of horses. He wrote that the utilization of animals in antiquity was inefficient because the ancients were limited by the technologies of their period, specifically the lack of horseshoes and a bad harness design. White expanded Noettes‚Äô conclusions into a thesis of his own that encompassed the relationship of the newly realized efficient horse and the agricultural revolution of the time. White pointed to new methods of crop rotation and plowing and tied them to the rise of manor-based collective farming and the shift in European prosperity and power from the Mediterranean to the North. White also touched on the stirrup, the lateen sail, the wheel barrow, the spinning wheel, the hand crank, water-driven mills and wind mills. He concluded: \\"The chief glory of the later Middle Ages was not its cathedrals or its epics or its scholasticism: it was the building for the first time in history of a complex civilization which rested not on the backs of sweating slaves or coolies but primarily on non-human power\\" and he credited this as well as Western primacy in technology to Western theology's \\"activist\\" tradition and \\"implicit assumption of the infinite worth of even the most degraded human personality\\" and its \\"repugnance towards subjecting any man to monotonous drudgery.\\" In 1942, White published a paper titled \\"Christian Myth and Christian History\\" in which he wrote about the relationship between historians and Christianity. He wrote: \\"Having lost faith that God revealed himself uniquely at one single point in history, we are relapsing into the essentially static or repetitive view of the time-process typical of antiquity and of the East\\" and \\"the Virgin Mother, undefiled yet productive, bearing Christ into the world by the action of the Spirit of God, is so perfect an analogue of the most intimate experience of the soul, that powerful myth has sustained dubious history; for, to the believer, myth and history have been one\\" and \\"Christianity above all other religions has rashly insisted that its myth really happened in time\\" and \\"we stand amid the debris of our inherited religious system.\\" White held out hope for a Christianity that celebrated its myths and made no pretensions to history, and saw Catholicism as the most progressive in this respect. At Mills College, White published on education and women, including \\"Women's Colleges and the Male Dominance\\" (1947), \\"Unfitting Women for Life\\" (1949), \\"Educating Women in a Man's World\\" (1950), and \\"The Future of Women's Education\\" (1953). Medieval technology and social change At UCLA, he used a set of lectures from 1957 to form his best-known work, Medieval Technology and Social Change in 1962. This book revisited almost all the themes from \\"Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages\\" 22 years earlier, but included a controversial theory about the stirrup. White contended in the first section of the book that the stirrup made shock combat possible, and therefore had a crucial role in shaping the feudal system. He believed this was the motivation for Charles Martel to accelerate confiscation of church-held lands and distribute it to his knights, who would bear the cost of themselves with expensive horses in to support him in battle. In the second section of the book, White explained the shift in power from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe as a result of increased productivity due to technological changes that produced a \\"heavy plow,\\" better harnesses for horses to pull the plow, and a three-field crop rotation scheme. In the third part of the book, he examined medieval machines that converted motion and energy. The most notable was the compound crank. The work elicited over 30 reviews, many of which were hostile. P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton wrote the most scathing of the early reviews, beginning with: \\"Technical determinism in historical studies has often been combined with adventurous speculations particularly attractive to those who like to have complex developments explained by simple causes. The technical determinism of Professor Lynn White Jr., however, is peculiar in that, instead of building new and provocative theories about general historical development on the basis of technical studies, he gives a misleadingly adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes by supporting them with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology.\\"P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton, \\"Technical Determinism: The Stirrup and the Plough Medieval Technology and Social Change by Lynn White, Review by: P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton\\", Past & Present, No. 24 (Apr., 1963), 90. Nevertheless, the book remains in print and still stands as a seminal work in the field. The historical roots of present-day ecologic crisis In 1967, White conjectured that the Christian influences in the Middle Ages were at the root of ecological crisis in the 20th century. He gave a lecture on December 26, 1966, titled, \\"The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis\\" at the Washington meeting of the AAAS, that was later published in the journal Science. White's article was based on the premise that \\"all forms of life modify their context\\", i.e. every living organism in some way alters its environment or habitat. He believed man's relationship with the natural environment was always a dynamic and interactive one, even in the Middle Ages, but marked the Industrial Revolution as a fundamental turning point in our ecological history. He suggests that at this point the hypotheses of science were married to the possibilities of technology and our ability to destroy and exploit the environment was vastly increased. Nevertheless, he also suggests that the mentality of the Industrial Revolution, that the earth was a resource for human consumption, was much older than the actuality of machinery, and has its roots in medieval Christianity and attitudes towards nature. He suggests that \\"what people do about their ecology depends on what they think about themselves in relation to things around them.\\" Citing the Genesis creation story he argued that Judeo-Christian theology had swept away pagan animism and normalized exploitation of the natural world because: #The Bible asserts man's dominion over nature and establishes a trend of anthropocentrism. #Christianity makes a distinction between man (formed in God's image) and the rest of creation, which has no \\"soul\\" or \\"reason\\" and is thus inferior. He posited that these beliefs have led to an indifference towards nature which continues to impact in an industrial, \\"post-Christian\\" world. He concludes that applying more science and technology to the problem will not help, that it is humanity's fundamental ideas about nature that must change; we must abandon \\"superior, contemptuous\\" attitudes that makes us \\"willing to use it [the earth] for our slightest whim.\\" White suggests adopting St. Francis of Assisi as a model in imagining a \\"democracy\\" of creation in which all creatures are respected and man's rule over creation is delimited. The debate White's ideas set off an extended debate about the role of religion in creating and sustaining the West's destructive attitude towards the exploitation of the natural world. It also galvanized interest in the relationship between history, nature and the evolution of ideas, thus stimulating new fields of study like environmental history and ecotheology. Equally, however, many saw his argument as a direct attack on Christianity and other commentators think his analysis of the impact of the Bible, and especially Genesis is misguided. They argue that Genesis provides man with a model of \\"stewardship\\" rather than dominion, and asks man to take care of the world's environment. Others, such as Lewis W. Montcrief, argue that our relation to the environment has been influenced by many more varied and complex cultural/historical phenomena,and that the result we see today cannot simply be reduced to the influence of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Later responses to his article include criticism not just of the central argument but also of the validity of his suggestion \\"I propose Francis as a patron saint for ecologists.\\" Jan J Boersema's article \\"Why is St Francis of Assisi the patron saint of ecologists?\\" in Science and Christian Belief 2002 (vol 14 pp. 51‚Äì77). Boersema argues that the historical evidence for Francis's status as such a patron saint is weak both in Francis' own writings and in the reliable sources about his life. Medieval technology and religion White was an historian, but had also earned a master's degree at Union Theological Seminary and was the son of a Calvinist professor of Christian Ethics, and considered religion integral to the development of Western technology. From his Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages of 1940, through his Dynamo and Virgin Reconsidered of 1958,In The American Scholar, vol. 27, pp. 183‚Äì194. to his Medieval Technology and Social Change (Oxford University Press, 1962), his work refuted the assumption that the Middle Ages were too preoccupied with theology and/or chivalry to concern themselves with technology, the assumption behind Henry Adams' antitheses of Virgin vs. dynamo, but widespread elsewhere as well.\\"Die Bourgeoisie hat enthuellt, wie the brutale Kraftauesserung, die die Reaktion so sehr am Mittelalter bewundert, in der traegsten Baerenhaeuterei ihre passende Ergaenzung fand.\\" Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei, London, 1848, in Karl Marx/Friedrich Engels, Werke, Berlin, Dietz Verlag, 1969, vol. 4, p. 465. White's view of writing history His work tied together that of many predecessors, above all that of Marc Bloch, to whose memory Medieval Technology and Social Change is dedicated. White argued, \\"Since, until recent centuries, technology was chiefly the concern of groups which wrote little, the role which technological development plays in human affairs has been neglected,\\" and declared, \\"If historians are to attempt to write the history of mankind, and not simply the history of mankind as it was viewed by the small and specialized segments of our race which have had the habit of scribbling, they must take a fresh view of the records, ask new questions of them, and use all the resources of archaeology, iconography, and etymology to find answers when no answers can be discovered in contemporary writings.\\" See also * Deep ecology * Religion and environmentalism References =Bibliography=   Further reading *Lynn Townsend White Jr., Medieval Religion and Technology (University of California Press, 1978).

The Office of Fair Trading made William Hill sell 78 of the 624 Stanley shops due to concerns over anti-competitive practices. Amidst fears that William Hill had overpaid for the Stanley shops, the company was relegated from the FTSE 100 Index in December 2005. In 2008, Ralph Topping was appointed Chief Executive. After having dropped out of Strathclyde University as a self-confessed 'rascal', Topping had taken a Saturday job at a William Hill betting shop near Hampden Park, Glasgow, in 1973 and worked his way up through the ranks.Business big shot: Ralph Topping The Times, London, 22 February 2008 In November 2008, William Hill went into partnership with Orbis (latterly OpenBet), and Israeli software company Playtech, to remedy its own failing online operation.William Hill in deal with Playtech to expand on-line gaming operation The Independent (London), 21 October 2008 Under the terms of the deal, William Hill paid Playtech's founder Teddy Sagi ¬£144.5m for various assets and affiliate companies.

The company wrote-off a reported ¬£26m when scrapping their previous in-house system.\\"Bookie's IT botch\\", Daily Mail, London, 11 January 2008 In June 2009 William Hill backed Playtech despite their partner having a quarter of its stock market value wiped out following a profits warning. In 2012 William Hill acquired three small sportsbook operators in Nevada, which at the time was the only state to offer full service sports betting. Following a Supreme Court ruling in 2017 the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was declared unconstitutional, meaning individual states could decide whether to offer sports betting or not. Since that ruling over 17 states have passed regulations to enable sports betting and William Hill has established the biggest reach of any operator and is the biggest operator in the US. On September 30, 2020, William Hill agreed to a ¬£2.9 billion takeover bid by Caesars Entertainment, the Nevada-based casino operator. The deal was unanimously recommended by the UK company's directors. It came after two rival bids by the US private equity group Apollo were turned down. Operations A William Hill betting shop in Tottenham, London in 2020 The company operates worldwide, employing approximately 14,000 people with main offices in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Gibraltar, offering betting by phone and Internet together with their 1,568 UK-wide Licensed Betting Offices. Its telebetting call centres, which are located in Rotherham, South Yorkshire took 125,000 bets on the 2007, Grand National and according to the company its betting shops process more than one million betting slips on an average day. In addition to its online sportsbook operations, the company offers online casino games, 'skill games', online bingo and online poker. Since the Gambling Act 2005, gaming machines have strengthened profits to counteract falling revenues in other areas.William Hill 'satisfied' with business, Yorkshire Post, Leeds, 24 April 2008 In August 2010, William Hill launched a training programme for its 10,000+ workforce to combat underage gambling in its retail outlets. In November 2008, analysts at UBS noted \\"concern\\" at the company's level of debt, which stood at over ¬£1bn and was later reported as ¬£1.5bn.William Hill; INSIDE THE CITY, The Sunday Times, London, 2 August 2009 In 2009 the company enacted both a rights issue and a corporate bond issue, in an effort to restructure its debt. The company operates 2,300 betting shops. On August 3, 2020, the bookmaker opened the first full-service betting operation housing professional sports teams in the U.S. at Capitol One Arena in Washington D.C. In August 2020, as a result of the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company announced that it will close 119 shops permanently. Despite that, only 16 employees will lose their job positions, while the others will be assigned to new positions. It also announced that the firm will be merging its retail and online operations. Outside the United Kingdom In 2009, William Hill moved its online and fixed-odds games division to Gibraltar, for tax avoidance purposes. In Gibraltar William Hill is a member of the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association. In March 2009, William Hill closed 14 of its shops in the Republic of Ireland with the loss of 53 jobs. In February 2010 it announced that the remaining 36 Irish shops were \\"under review\\" pending the possible introduction of controversial gaming machines to Irish shops. William Hill had pulled out of Italy in 2008 after just two years, a failure which cost the company ¬£1m in wasted investment. The company's joint venture in Spain ended in January 2010 with partners Codere buying William Hill's 50% stakeholding for ‚Ç¨1, after both parties had invested an 'initial' ‚Ç¨10m in April 2008. William Hill lost ¬£11.6m in 2008 and ¬£9.3m in 2009 on the venture. In September 2009, the company participated in the bidding for the first online gambling licence in India, expressing their interest to enter the Indian betting market via the remote Himalayan state of Sikkim. In June 2012, William Hill expanded to Nevada, the only U.S. state to allow full-fledged sports wagering, buying three chains of sportsbooks: Lucky's, Leroy's, and the satellite operations of Club Cal Neva, for a total of $53 million. The deals at the time gave the company control of 55 percent of the state's sportsbook locations, and 11 percent of statewide book revenue. All three chains were to be rebranded under the William Hill name. In 2013, three Australian brands, Sportingbet, Centrebet and Tom Waterhouse, were purchased by the company and later rebranded as William Hill Australia in 2015. Both Sportingbet and Centrebet were acquired in March of the year for $660m and $132m, respectively, while tomwaterhouse.com was brought in during August 2013, for an initial $34m.William Hill: Launches Australia Tom Waterhouse was appointed Chief Executive Officer of William Hill Australia in July 2014.William Hill: Tom Waterhouse In March 2018, William Hill sanctioned the sale of its Australian business to CrownBet holdings for an estimated value of AU $300 million. The sale ended the company's time in Australia after entering the market in 2012. Following the decision of the US Supreme Court regarding the case of Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in June 2018, the state of New Jersey effectively legalised gambling on athletic events due to a previously successful state ballot initiative. William Hill entered arrangements to provide bookmaking services to both Monmouth Park Racetrack and Ocean Resort Casino in the state of New Jersey. In January 2019, William Hill's stock value declined following the announcement that United States Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel reversed a 2011 view of the Federal Wire Act, stating all online gambling was illegal under federal law. Sponsorship In 2007, William Hill threatened to withdraw its sponsorship of various horse races, in their dispute with racecourses over TurfTV. William Hill, who had been the strongest critic of TurfTV, were later forced into a humiliating climbdown and subscribed to the channel in January 2008. In August 2009, William Hill became the shirt-sponsor of M√°laga CF, a football team in Spain's La Liga on a 3-year deal which was terminated early the following season due to the new club owner's religious objections. The company sponsors the annual William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, dedicated to rewarding excellence in sports writing. Advertising In May 2008, The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned William Hill from running a television advert which they found \\"condoned gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible\\". In October 2009, the ASA banned a poster and National press advert which promised \\"¬£100 OF FREE BETS\\". The advert was found to be \\"likely to mislead\\" and in breach of a Committee of Advertising Practice code relating to \\"truthfulness\\". In March 2010, an advert stating \\"William Hill best prices FACT\\" was banned by the ASA. It had breached several Committee of Advertising Practice codes, including those relating to \\"substantiation\\", \\"truthfulness\\" and \\"honesty\\". In September 2011, William Hill made a television advert featuring the 2005 single \\"A Bit Patchy\\". In December 2012, adverts stating \\"Best Prices on the Best Horses\\" and \\"Best Prices on the Best Teams\\" were banned by the ASA. It had breached several Committee of Advertising Practice code, including those relating to \\"misleading advertising\\", \\"Substantiation\\" and \\"Comparisons\\". The ASA also banned a different advert claiming \\"Best Odds Guaranteed\\" because it was misleading. Controversies The company has been criticised by trade unions Community and Unite for its treatment of shop- workers. In particular the practices of exposing staff to risk by forcing them to work in the offices alone, and requiring staff to undertake unpaid work after the end of their working day have been identified. From 2001 until 2009, William Hill paid George Howarth MP ¬£30,000 pa. to act as a Parliamentary advisor. While on William Hill's payroll he tabled amendments to the 2003 budget proposing tougher levels of taxation for person-to-person betting exchanges.\\"MP acting as bookies' lackey is a disgrace\\", The Telegraph, London, 19 May 2003\\"MP ACCUSED ON BET LAWS\\", Daily Echo, Liverpool, 26 May 2003 Howarth left the role in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal.\\"MP quits bookmaker job ahead of crackdown; Private earnings under spotlight\\", Daily Post, Liverpool, 29 June 2009 In May 2015, William Hill presented prototype of \\"Get In The Race\\" - a virtual horse racing application. On 2 August 2016, it acquired Grand Parade, the betting and gaming digital solutions company for ¬£13.6m in cash and shares. In 2018, William Hill was fined ¬£6.2 million by the Gambling Commission for systematic failures regarding anti-money laundering and problem gambling. The operator was found to have accepted large deposits of cash linked to criminal activity between 2014 and 2016, resulting in ¬£1.2 million in financial gains. William Hill was ordered to return the ¬£1.2 million profit, plus pay a penalty of ¬£5 million for breaching regulations. See also *Calvert v. William Hill *Menashe v.

Lviv-Holovnyi railway station () is the main railway terminal in Lviv, Ukraine. It is one of the most notable pieces of Art Nouveau architecture in former Galicia. The station was opened to the public in 1904, and celebrated its centennial anniversary on 26 March 2004. On a monthly basis, the terminal handles over 1.2 million passengers and moves 16 thousand tons of freight.  History  Postcard of the station, circa 1915. Construction of an extensive net of railways within the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed the city of Lemberg (its German name at the time) to retain its nodal position at the crossing of several notable trade routes. As the capital of Galicia, the city needed a new, representative and large railway station that would suit the city needs and replace the old neo-Gothic railway station built between 1861 and 1862 with the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis. In 1888 the Polish architect and a graduate of the Lw√≥w Technical Academy W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sad≈Çowski was selected to design a new station. The final project, prepared in less than a year, encompassed a large, horizontally- oriented main hall, with two large train yards located in the background. The main entrance was topped with a large dome made of bolted steel and stained glass. Both wings of the symmetrical building were constituted by two pavilions, each with a smaller cupola. The main entrance was flanked by a set of Tuscan columns and large mythological sculptures, with the one representing Hypnos being the most notable. Since Sad≈Çowski was the main representative of the William Morris' Arts and Crafts movement in Poland, his project included not only the architectural part of the future building, but also the ornaments and decorations. The project of three waiting halls (one for each class of travellers) was prepared in cooperation with another graduate of Sad≈Çowski's alma mater, Alfred Zachariewicz. The first class waiting hall was modelled after the style of an English gentleman's club, and was equipped with dark, luxurious Viennese-style furniture, resembling the works of the Wiener Werkst√§tte. The second class waiting room was modelled after 19th century burgher houses in Galicia, while the third class waiting hall was equipped with simple wooden pieces of furniture, modelled after the Zakopane style of Polish Gorals made by the artist Tadeusz Obmi≈Ñski. The ornaments featured in the tunnels leading to the platforms and in the platforms themselves were prepared by the Krak√≥w-based company of J√≥zef G√≥recki. Made of bent steel, the balustrades and railings bore direct resemblance to the style of the Paris M√©tro ornaments designed by Hector Guimard. A design for the registers was constructed in Zieleniewski Maschinen und Wagonbau-Gesellschaft Werk Sanok, (Autosan). Construction started in 1899 and lasted until 1904, when the railway station was opened to the public.Centennial Celebration It was visited by some of the most renowned architects of the epoch, and influenced the later construction of the train stations in Prague (Josef Franta, 1909) and Vienna (Otto Wagner). During World War II, when the city was under the rule of the Soviet Union, the occupied eastern Poland railways were integrated into the Soviet Railway system. The station suffered extensive damage during the war, including a completely destroyed trainshed. There was an open debate on whether to restore the building or to dismantle the ruins and build anew. Architect G.F. Domashenko managed to bring both parties to agreement, and between 1949 and 1953 the old structure was given a contemporary Stalinist interior, whilst a full repair on the outside preserved its original view. Frequent renovations and upgrades ensured that the service and building was always up to modern standards, a tradition which Ukraine continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century, with the most recent major restoration being carried out in 2003.

They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull. The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \\"microsaurs\\", \\"nectrideans\\", and a√Østopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae. Most adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta et al. assigned Acherontiscus to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \\"lepospondyls\\" known from fossils.  Description  A skeletal diagram of Acherontiscus Adelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the a√Østopods and lysorophian \\"microsaurs\\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the a√Østopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in Adelogyrinus and Palaeomolgophis by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in Adelospondylus, but these later considered to be hyoids as in Adelogyrinus. = Skull = Adelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and a√Østopods, which had snake- like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \\"chisel-shaped\\" teeth, while Acherontiscus had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a maze-like internal structure like those of \\"labyrinthodonts\\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth. Life restoration of Palaeomolgophis Similar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjacent intertemporal), and squamosal. The intertemporal is lost (or fused into other bones) in a variety of unrelated tetrapod groups. The same process additionally occurs to the supratemporal in several lepospondyls, namely \\"microsaurs\\" and a few \\"nectrideans\\" such as Scincosaurus and diplocaulids. Adelospondyls take this one step further. They possess only a single bone between the jaw joint and the skull roof. This bone is often believed to be a fusion between the tabular and the squamosal (termed a \\"tabular-squamosal\\" or \\"squamosotabular\\"), although it is also conceivable that the tabular disappeared completely leaving only the enlarged squamosal in its place. = Postcranial bones = Adelospondyls can also be characterized by their vertebrae compared to other lepospondyls. They were spool-shaped and high in number, with Acherontiscus having an estimated 64 vertebrae and an indeterminate juvenile adelogyrinid having at least 70. Most of these vertebrae lack haemal spines, indicating that the primary elongation took place in the body rather than the tail. The neural spines are not fused to the centra, a characteristic which D.M.S. Watson (1929) used to characterize the adelospondyls as a distinct order. In fact, the name \\"adelospondyl\\" is Greek for \\"obscure vertebra\\", referencing both the rarity of adelospondyls and this trait. However, Watson also included Lysorophus as an adelospondyl rather than a lysorophian \\"microsaur\\", and other studies have shown that the absence of neurocentral fusion is very common among tetrapods, and therefore useless as a distinguishing feature. However, adelospondyls do have an additional quality of the vertebrae which is unique compared to other lepospondyls. In most lepospondyls, the left and right halves of each vertebra's neural arch are separate, rather than fused as in other tetrapods. Adelospondyls retain the primitive condition of the two halves being completely fused, making their vertebrae unique among lepospondyls. Acherontiscus deviates from the norm of the subclass even more than other adelospondyls, as it possessed two separate bony components of the centra, rather than a single centrum (which is the case in adelogyrinids and other lepospondyls). These two different components (the intercentrum at the front and pleurocentrum at the back) were nearly equal in size, similar to the vertebrae of embolomeres. Although adelospondyls lost all trace of their fore- and hind-limbs, they did retain a notable remnant of their presumably limbed ancestors. This remnant is a large bony dermal shoulder girdle, comprising the plate-like interclavicle which was positioned on the midline of the chest, two clavicle bones on either side of it, and two boomerang-shaped cleithrum bones at the base of the neck. On the other hand, the bones of the endochondral shoulder girdle (i.e. the scapulae and coracoids), which supported the forelimbs, were lost along with the limbs. Adelospondyls possessed a large bony hyoid apparatus, including gill- supporting bones such as hypobranchials and ceratobranchials. Long, thin scales have been preserved in most adelospondyl specimens, and they were more abundant on the ventral (belly) side of the body rather than the dorsal (back) side.

Cultivation and uses Some species, most commonly C. dactylon, are grown as lawn grasses in warm temperate regions, such as the Sunbelt area of the United States where they are valued for their drought tolerance compared to most other lawn grasses. Propagation is by rhizomes, stolons, or seeds. In some cases it is considered to be a weed; it spreads through lawns and flower beds, where it can be difficult to kill with herbicides without damaging other grasses or plants. It is difficult to pull out because the rhizomes and stolons break readily, and then re-grow. It is also noted for its common use on the surface of greens on golf courses, as well as football and baseball playing fields. Recent news reports claim that a Bermuda-derived F1 hybrid called Tifton 85 suddenly started producing cyanide and killed a cattle herd in Texas, USA.

The company was founded in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, in 1948 by Willi Studer. It initially became known in the 1950s for its professional tape recorders. In the 1990s the company moved into the manufacture of mixing consoles. Management, sales, engineering, R&D; and customer service were based in Regensdorf, Switzerland, until owners Harman International Industries closed down the Swiss entity in March 2018 transferring the now decentralised operation to China, Hungary, and the US. Manufacturing, marketing, and customer support were part of the Soundcraft facility in Potters Bar, England until Harman closed the Potters Bar facility in June 2016 and moved manufacturing and customer support to Hungary. Studer is currently a subsidiary of Harman International Industries which is owned by Samsung Electronics. History Willi Studer began to make high-tension oscilloscopes in 1948. These products were in production until 1968. In March 1951, Studer introduced the Revox brand name subsidiary. In 1990, Studer sold the Studer-Revox group to Motor-Columbus AG, including all subsidiary companies. In 1991, Motor-Columbus split the Studer-Revox Group into separate Studer, Revox and manufacturing-divisions. Motor-Columbus sold several subsidiaries and plants. The extensive reorganization culminated in the sale of the Studer group to Harman International Industries in March 1994. The Revox group was excluded and sold to private investors. On March 17, 1994, Harman completed its acquisition and acquired from Motor-Columbus AG 100% of Studer-Revox AG. Harman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Studer-Revox. Harman assumed post- acquisition indebtedness of Studer-Revox of approximately 23 million Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million). Harman later moved some of its Studer business operations to England and merged them with operations of its Soundcraft subsidiary. Willi Studer died on March 1, 1996. Tape recorders In 1949, Studer branched out into the audio business by modifying imported tape recorders from the United States. By 1950, they had developed their own line of tape recorders, named the Dynavox series. The company has built a variety of 2-track recorder models throughout its history for stereo recording. Several Studer components were sold under the Revox name, with slight modifications, at a lower price. The Revox variants were designed for consumer use, with features such as IR remote control, and the omission of balanced input/output sockets. The core circuitry of the two was otherwise substantially identical. One of the company's models was the Revox A77 recorder, which was introduced in 1967. Studer designed and produced multitrack recorders. Studer‚Äôs first multi-track machine, the model J37, was released in 1964. It recorded 4 tracks on one inch tape. A pair of J37s were used by The Beatles to record Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. Later analog Studer machines were built in 8, 16, and 24-track configurations using tape widths of up to two inches. Sales of analog machines continued into the early 1990s, when they began to be replaced by digital recorders. In this period, Studer introduced the D820 and D827 multitrack models, which employed the Digital Audio Stationary Head standard. However, digital tape formats eventually fell from favor with the introduction of computerized hard disk drive recording systems and software products such as Pro Tools. Mixing consoles In the mid 1990s Studer started to develop digital mixing consoles. After introduction of OnAir 2000 with Touch'n Action user interface in 1997, the D950 was the first digital large frame desk Studer introduced in 1998. With Vista Series (Vista 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, V, and X) Studer launched in 2003 the Vistonics user interface with knobs-on-glass technology. Some older Vista models have been discontinued but Vista 1, 5, V, and X remain in production. Vista 5BE (Black Edition) is the latest model of this series continuing the use of x86 CPU technology replacing SHARC based DSP engines. The Studer Vista 9M2 (launched September 2013) is a TV broadcast/live production console equipped with the patented Vistonics knobs-on-glass user interface and FaderGlow is used by TV broadcasters including the BBC, RAI, France TV, TV Globo, ABC, NRK, DR and many others. Studer also offers radio broadcast consoles with the Glacier control surfaces (replacing the now discontinued On Air 3000 and 2500 controllers) added to the remaining On Air range that includes the OnAir 1500.

Family John Foot was born at Pencrebar, Callington, Cornwall, the third son of Isaac Foot (1880‚Äì1960) and his wife Eva Mackintosh (died 1946). His father was a solicitor and founder of the Plymouth law firm of Foot and Bowden. Isaac was also an active member of the Liberal Party, the Liberal MP for Bodmin before World War II and the Lord Mayor of Plymouth after the war. His elder siblings were barrister Sir Dingle Foot, QC (1905‚Äì1978), who subsequently became both a Liberal and Labour MP and Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon (1907‚Äì1990), who became Governor of Cyprus (1957‚Äì1960) and then the UK representative to the United Nations (1964‚Äì1970). His younger siblings were Margaret Elizabeth Foot (1911‚Äì1965), Michael Foot (1913‚Äì2010), a Labour MP, Cabinet Minister and Leader of the Opposition (1980‚Äì1983), Jennifer Mackintosh Highet (born 1916) and Christopher Isaac Foot (born 1917). He married an American, Anne (Bailey Farr) in 1936 and they had a son and a daughter. Early life He was educated at Forres School, Swanage and then Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. He went on to read jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union in 1931, following in the steps of his elder brother Dingle (1928) and preceding his younger brother Michael (1933). After graduation he joined the family law firm before serving in the Wessex Division, reaching the rank of Major, and also on the HQ Staff of the 21st Army Group during World War II. After the war he rejoined the family law firm and subsequently became the senior partner there following the death of his father in 1960. Political career Foot was considered by brother Michael as the best orator and the \\"ablest member of the family\\". He first stood as a Liberal candidate in a 1934 by-election, in the safe Conservative seat of Basingstoke, and ran again there in the 1935 general election. In both the 1945 and 1950 elections, he stood in Bodmin, being defeated by the Conservative Sir Douglas Marshall on both occasions. He remained in the Liberal Party during the long period of its post-war decline and was subsequently made a life peer on 29 November 1967 as Baron Foot, of Buckland Monachorum in the County of Devon. He served as Chairman of the UK Immigrants Advisory Service from 1970-78 where he did not hesitate to criticise the Wilson Government for the inadequate fulfilment of their pledges to the persecuted Kenyan and Ugandan Asians. He was also a robust environmental defender of Dartmoor against the expansionist ambitions of Plymouth Council. Death He died aged 90 on 11 October 1999, survived by his wife and children.

Unlike the Debye model, the Havriliak‚ÄìNegami relaxation accounts for the asymmetry and broadness of the dielectric dispersion curve. The model was first used to describe the dielectric relaxation of some polymers, by adding two exponential parameters to the Debye equation: : \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\infty} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\varepsilon}{(1+(i\\\\omega\\\\tau)^{\\\\alpha})^{\\\\beta}}, where \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\infty} is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, \\\\Delta\\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon_{s}-\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\infty} where \\\\varepsilon_{s} is the static, low frequency permittivity, and \\\\tau is the characteristic relaxation time of the medium. The exponents \\\\alpha and \\\\beta describe the asymmetry and broadness of the corresponding spectra. Depending on application, the Fourier transform of the stretched exponential function can be a viable alternative that has one parameter less.

It lies on the River Sarthe from Alen√ßon, the chef-lieu of the department, and some west of Paris. History The place is named for Serenicus (or Genericus), an Italian hermit who lived here during the 8th century. When he died, a monastery was built, later destroyed by the Vikings in 903. The church was a dependency of the abbey of Saint-Evroult-en-Ouche. The name le-G√©rei comes from William Giroie, who built a castle here in 1044 of which only parts of the walls remain today. In 1060 the castle came under siege from Duke William II of Normandy (the future King William I of England) before being taken by Robert Curthose his son in 1088. During the Hundred Years' War, Ambroise de Lor√© managed to defend the stronghold against the king of England Henry V and, then his brother John Plantagenet until 1434. The beauty of the village's setting, in a wooded loop of the River Sarthe, has attracted and inspired many artists since the 19th century. The village even has its own festival which annually celebrates those painters who came to, or lived in, Saint-C√©neri-le-G√©rei. Economy Saint-C√©neri's economy is largely based on tourism, its status as one of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (\\"France's Most Beautiful Villages\\") and its tranquil environment attracting many visitors to the village. Transport Saint-C√©neri lies within 10 to of both the A28 motorway - linking Abbeville to Tours by way of Rouen and Le Mans - and the N12 trunk road from Paris to Rennes and Brest.

Created by Charles Pratt, Jr. and Robert Guza, Jr., the character made her debut on the episode airing on October 1, 2003, portrayed by Kelly Monaco. Sam is the daughter of mob boss Julian Jerome (William deVry) and attorney Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn), born and given up for adoption when both were teenagers. She arrived in town as a con artist trying to reverse her family's bad luck by destroying the five lucky cards of the \\"Dead Man's Hand.\\" Upon her arrival she was characterized as a \\"sexy bad girl, with a nose for intrigue.\\" Since her introduction, the character has matured into a self-assured and confident woman, while still retaining traces of her adventuresome, bad girl ways. Monaco's performance has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered her the Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2006. Casting The role of Sam was originated by former Baywatch star and Playboy's April 1997 Playmate of the Month, Kelly Monaco on October 1, 2003. Monaco, who had previously portrayed Livvie Locke on the ABC Daytime soap opera Port Charles, was one of several performers from the cancelled soap to join the cast of a main daytime show. Monaco had also auditioned for ABC Daytime's All My Children as well as CBS Daytime's As the World Turns, both of which were based in New York at the time, and Monaco's eagerness to stay on the West coast led to her ultimately signing with General Hospital, based in Los Angeles. In 2005, Monaco joined the first season of ABC's Dancing with the Stars and was the first champion of what turned into a multi-season competition. In August 2009, a casting call was sent out to recast the role of Sam, leaving fans shocked by her possible departure. Despite rumors and speculation, Monaco's co-stars Steve Burton (Jason Morgan) and Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis Davis) denied she was departing from the show. Monaco herself dispelled the rumors, stating there was \\"really no doubt\\" she would renew her contract; it was merely standard procedure for ABC to release the casting call since she and the network had not signed off on a new contract by a set deadline. In July 2020, it was announced that Monaco would take temporary leave from the role; in a social media post, Monaco's mother cited her need to take a 14-day, self-isolated quarantine‚Äîfollowing a \\"breathing problem\\" after production resumed‚Äîrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As a result, the role was recast with Lindsay Hartley, who appeared from August 4 to August 13, 2020. Monaco returned to the role on August 18. Storylines =Backstory= Samantha, also known as Sam, is born on May 11, 1980, (Mother's Day) in Chatham, MaineThough Chatham is established by the series as being a town in Maine, in real life, Chatham is actually a town in New Hampshire and it meets with the border of Maine. to a 16-year-old Alexis Davidovitch (Nancy Lee Grahn). While at boarding school, Alexis' father, Mikkos Cassadine (John Colicos), forces her to give the child up and later forges documents to make Alexis believe the child is dead. Sam is adopted by Cody McCall (Stanley Kamel) and his wife, Evelyn Bass, who choose adoption based on fear of having another mentally handicapped baby like their first child Danny (then Henri Lubatti). Cody is a con artist and his way of life forces Evelyn to leave when Sam is only three years old, taking Danny with her. Cody raises Sam on his own and teaches her the art of the con. When Sam is 17, she tracks down Evelyn in Bailey's Beach, South Carolina and is shocked to find Danny locked in the basement. When Sam helps Danny escape, he accidentally knocks a candle over that burns down the house, not knowing Evelyn was inside. Sam is arrested for arson, but gets out on bail and goes on the run with Danny to avoid being convicted for Evelyn's murder. A young Sam does her best to care for Danny but eventually resorts to extreme measures to pay his bills. Using skills she learned from Cody, Sam marries several wealthy men, and steals their money so she can care for her brother. During her last attempt at a con as \\"Angela Monroe\\", Sam finds herself in an abusive situation when her wealthy mark, Bill Monroe, discovers Sam's intentions, and attacks her. Sam ends up killing Bill in self-defense. =2003‚Äì2007= Sam first appears in Port Charles working with Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) to find the five lucky cards of the \\"Dead Man's Hand.\\" They have a brief affair, but when Jax's father dies he blames Sam, due to her scheming. Sam then has an affair with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), who is married, and becomes pregnant. His best friend Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) claims to be the child's father to keep Sonny's family together. Jason and Sam bond as Sam prepares to give birth and they decide to raise the child together. She decides to name her daughter Lila after Jason's grandmother, Lila Quartermaine (Anna Lee). Sonny's daughter Kristina Davis (then Kali Rodriguez) is diagnosed with a blood disease, and Sam's daughter is proven to be a donor match. Kristina's mother, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn), begs Sam to induce labor two weeks early in order to donate her child's stem cells. Sam refuses, fearing it could hurt the baby. While arguing with Alexis, Sam collapses and Baby Girl McCall is stillborn. Sam is heartbroken over the loss of her daughter, and angry at Alexis, blaming her for her baby's death. Jason grieves with Sam and helps her through the aftermath; they fall in love, eventually getting engaged. Sam helps deliver a baby girl during a storm to a teenage mother named Bridget Daly. Bridget gives her baby to Sam, as she's unable to provide for it. Sam and Jason plan to adopt baby Hope. Bridget decides to keep the baby, leaving Sam devastated. Sam is accused of kidnapping Kristina soon after, and she and Jason try to find her to prove Sam's innocence. After Sonny's sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan, are also kidnapped, Sam is cleared of suspicion. Jason and Sam are on a trip when they are kidnapped by Allegra Montenegro, played by Meg Bennett, the wife of Executive Producer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. Allegra wants Sam to pose as her daughter, Alicia, and marry Andrew Olsen to help the Montenegros regain their rich lifestyle. The storyline was received as an attempt to win ratings due to Monaco's recent success on the first season of Dancing with the Stars, as Sam is forced to learn to ballroom dance in order to make Andrew believe she is really Alicia. When Andrew is killed, Sam is nearly sent to jail until Alicia is arrested for the murder. Sam is released, and she and Jason return to Port Charles. As Sam settles back into her life, Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo) began stalking her. When several Port Charles residents are infected by the encephalitis plague, Danny dies; Sam blames Alexis since she received the last antidote over Danny. After Danny's death, Sam discovers that she was adopted, and her biological mother is Alexis. Sam keeps it to herself, wanting nothing to do with Alexis. However, when Sam is shot by Manny and near death, Jason tells Alexis the truth. Alexis pressures Jason into ending the relationship, but Sam tries to win him back. When all of her efforts fail, she and Alexis get into a heated argument, during which Alexis insults her and calls her derogatory names. Angry, Sam gets drunk and has a one-night stand with Alexis's husband, Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst). Ric later frames Sam for theft, forcing her to go on the run. She and Jason are ambushed by thugs, and Sam appears to kill Diego Alcazar (Ignacio Serricchio) as Kristina watches. Sam and Jason reconcile, and Sam hopes to have a child, but finds out she is infertile from her shooting. After Sam escapes during the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis and warns the police, television producer Amelia Joffe (Annie Wersching) hires her as the host of the new talk show, Everyday Heroes. However, Amelia is actually looking for revenge on Sam for killing her father, Bill Monroe. Sam does her best to keep her past from coming out and she begins lying to Jason. Meanwhile, Sam learns that Elizabeth Spencer's (Rebecca Herbst) son, Jake, is actually Jason's son. Sam witnesses Jake get kidnapped, but doesn't say anything. After Jake is rescued, Jason finds out about Sam and Jake, and they began a 2-year break up; she also hires actors to scare Elizabeth and Jake in the park. Sam fakes a rescue, but Jason finds out Sam hired the gunmen; he threatens to kill Sam for her out of control actions. =2008‚Äì2012= Sam seduced Elizabeth's husband Lucky Spencer (then Greg Vaughan) to get revenge on Jason and Liz, but they eventually fall in love. However, once Lucky finds out about Sam's part in Jake's kidnapping, they split up. Meanwhile, Sam is stalked and injured by the Text Message Killer, who is later revealed to be an alive Diego Alcazar. While fleeing from Diego she is struck by a car driven by Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson), who is under the influence of alcohol. Sam forgives Monica, helping her get a lenient sentence to rehab. When Sam and Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson) start their own investigative agency, Jason and Sam begin to grow close again. Sam realizes that a teenage Kristina is becoming rebellious and tries to help her. When Claudia Zacchara (Sarah Joy Brown) has an accident, Sam worries that Kristina is responsible; Jason tells her he thinks it was Michael. When the two teens run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason chase after them. Sam is kidnapped by Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©), but rescued by Jason, and the two locate Michael and Kristina. After returning to Port Charles, Sam and Jason get back together for the first time in 2 years. Jason is stalked by crazed artist Franco (then James Franco), who kidnaps and threatens Sam to get to Jason. Sam shares with Kristina her experience of being in an abusive relationship after Kristina is beaten by her boyfriend, Kiefer Bauer (Christian Alexander). After Michael is sent to prison, Sam struggles with Jason going to prison so he can protect Michael. Jason is eventually released, and later that year must protect Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil) from the European crime boss The Balkan (Daniel Benzali). During Sonny and Brenda's wedding, Sam is nearly killed in a car bomb set for Brenda, but she survives. Sam has reconstructive surgery so she and Jason can have a baby. Sam and Jason soon become engaged and get married. During their honeymoon, Sam becomes pregnant with Jason's child. Franco shows up and drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and forces him to watch as he supposedly rapes Sam. Sam discovers she's pregnant after returning home, and a paternity test establishes Jason as the father. Jason's cousin Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) tells Sam that Franco and Jason are fraternal twin brothers, and a new DNA test shows Franco is the father of Sam's baby. Jason is unsure if he can love Franco's child, and Sam moves out. Sam gives birth to a baby boy with the help of John McBain (Michael Easton), but she passes out and is unaware that Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) and Heather switch the baby with the stillborn son of T√©a Delgado (Florencia Lozano). Sam wakes up, and believes her son is dead. The pain and grief overwhelms her, and she decides to file for a divorce from Jason. Sam continues to confide in John, and they share a flirtation. Jason figures out the truth about Sam's son, but by the time he figures it out, Heather has kidnapped the baby. Jason and Sam reunite and rescue their son, naming him Daniel Edward Morgan. The two reconcile, but Jason disappears after being shot by Cesar Faison (Anders Hove); he is presumed dead, but Sam remains determined to find him. After Jason disappears, Sam finds out that Jason is Danny's biological father. =2013‚Äì2015= Sam eventually realizes that Jason is not coming back and tries to move on. Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) comes to town, and claims John is a vampire named Caleb Morley. Sam believes Lucy is insane, until a woman named Alison Barrington (Erin Hershey) is murdered, and her son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler), claims John is the murderer. Sam is kidnapped by Caleb, but rescued by John, Rafe, and Lucy. Sam later becomes a foster mother to Rafe. Sam meets Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton), Rafe's uncle, who decides to get physical custody of Rafe from Sam. Though the court sides with Silas, he lets Rafe stay with Sam. Meanwhile, Sam finds out that Danny has leukemia, and needs treatment. Silas assists in Danny's recovery, but determines Danny will need a bone marrow transplant. When no one is a match, Sam asks Alexis about her biological father. Alexis admits she doesn't know who Sam's father is, because she never met him again. Alexis undergoes hypnosis to help Sam, and finds out Sam's father's name is \\"Julian.\\" Sam finds a bone marrow match for Danny to Derek Wells (William DeVry), and Danny recovers. Alexis figures out that Sam's father is Julian Jerome, a mobster presumed dead. Sam and Silas start dating, and Sam finds out that \\"Derek\\" is actually Julian, who plans to take over Sonny's territory. When Sonny threatens to kill him, Julian uses Danny as leverage to stay alive, in case Danny suffers a setback. Sam is disgusted with her father's actions, and writes him off. Rafe died after being taken off life support following an accident, and Silas accused Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson), Rafe's doctor, of deliberately killing him because Rafe caused a car accident that led to the death of Patrick's son. Sam knew Patrick didn't kill Rafe, which led to her and Silas breaking up. Sam befriended \\"Jake Doe\\" (Billy Miller), an amnesiac patient at the hospital who had facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. She also started a relationship with Patrick. After Faison is arrested, Sam was taken hostage by a gunman who helped Faison escape. Sam wanted to find the gunman, and realized it was Jake. Though he denied the accusation, Jake was arrested, and Sam confronted him. Jake realized that he had been brainwashed by Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers), and Sam's accusations were correct. Sam forgave him, and helped him get a job and figure out his real identity. Sam got engaged to Patrick, but right after, she found out that \\"Jake\\" is actually Jason. Sam reeled from the news, trying to process what to do. Jason went to Cassadine Island to confront Helena, and Sam followed him there. Helena continued to taunt Jason, and Sam lashed out, furious at Helena for keeping Jason from her and Danny. Helena retaliated by cursing Sam before supposedly dying. Sam returned to Port Charles, where Patrick realized that Sam was still in love with Jason, and broke off their engagement. Sam was heartbroken, but accepted his decision. =2016‚Äìpresent= Jason and Sam began to reconnect, as Jason started to experience memory flashes while spending time with Sam. When Elizabeth's house was broken into, Jason asked for Sam's help investigating. Sam figured out that Elizabeth and Jason's son, Jake, was responsible. Sam ended up getting seriously injured when she discovered the truth, but Jason was able to rescue her. Though the two reconnected, Sam decided to get a divorce, wanting to not pressure Jason to remember their past. Jason agreed, and the two divorced, but started dating. Jason ends up recovering his memories after getting into an accident, and reunites with Sam. Sam went into hiding with Jason after Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) disappeared, and Jason was accused of killing him. She and Jason figured out that Nikolas faked his death, and tracked him down to Cassadine Island. Before they could bring Nikolas back, they were taken hostage by Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart). Sam and Jason escaped, and managed to free the other hostages. They returned to Port Charles, and cleared Jason's name. Soon after, Sam found out she was pregnant, and was thrilled until she found out that she could have been exposed to malaria. Sam shares her news with Jason; despite the potential risk to the baby, Jason is elated. He proposes to Sam, and they get engaged again. Sam learns she is malaria free, assuring her the baby is healthy thanks to their new friend Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton). She and Jason get married again. Sam eventually starts to bond with Julian and gives her blessing for him to marry Alexis. However, she disowns him again after he lets Alexis get arrested for a crime he committed, then tries to kill her when Alexis exonerates herself. He's put on trial for his crimes, but ends up getting acquitted. Soon after, Julian's car explodes, killing Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig). Sam and Jason investigate; at first, they suspect Sonny, but Jason finds out he's innocent. He and Sam try to find the real killer to prove Sonny's innocence. The clues lead Sam to discover that Morgan was killed by Olivia St. John (Tonja Walker), Julian's sister. Olivia kidnaps Sam and when she tries to escape, she is severely injured by Olivia and left unconscious. Sam survives, but ends up going into labor. Jason finds her, and helps Sam give birth to Emily Scout Morgan. They're immediately taken to the hospital, where Sam ends up in a coma after surgery; she wakes up and recovers On New Year's Eve 2017, Jason and Sam began to kiss as 2018 began, but Drew interrupts them. Jason wanted to be happy together with Sam, but he learned that she loves Drew. While although she loved Jason, Sam and Drew decided to start 2018 by getting engaged and decided to get married. But first, Jason and Sam agreed to get a divorce, and they officially divorced, and making her happy with Drew, then on January 22, Drew and Sam were married, and they became co-owners of Aurora Media since they got married for love and business. In early March, in the aftermath of the earthquake, Sam revealed her feelings to her ex-husband Jason that she still loves him, then later in the month, Drew heard her that she had developed feelings for Jason in love, and they decided to be separated by having her dumped him for good. In May 2018, she began a partnership with Curtis by being private investigators for McCall & Ashford. Character development =Introduction= When the character is introduced, Sam is described as \\"an adventurous woman trying to reverse her family's bad fortune\\", who would immediately interact with character Jasper Jacks (Rademacher). She is independent and scheming. Soaps In Depth named the character on their list of the 50 naughtiest soap opera vixens in 2009. When she first arrives in town, she is portrayed as a con artist and bad girl, who knew how to get what she wanted. The motivation behind the character's bad girl ways were revealed, when it was discovered that she was raised on the road by a con artist father, Cody McCall, and used cons to provide for her mentally handicapped older brother, Danny McCall. Sam grows close to Jason Morgan during her pregnancy with the child of Sonny Corinthos. Co-star Burton (Jason) later explained: \\"It's been a long journey for Jason and Sam. When they first got together, it wasn't really supposed to be that they got together. He was kind of helping her out with her pregnancy. After that whole time they fell in love.\\" When the couple broke up in 2008, Monaco said to Soap Opera Digest, \\"I feel Sam and Jason was so abruptly ended without any explanation, really, as to the coldness that was so one-sided [on Jason's part]. Of course, Jake came into play, but I felt like Jason and Sam were always strong enough to overcome.\\" Sam begins a relationship with Lucky Spencer to get back at Elizabeth. Monaco describes the progression of the relationship to Soap Opera Digest, \\"In the beginning it was very calculated and manipulative. Eventually, it turned genuine. [...] finally, she found someone who is trustworthy.\\" =Parentage revealed= The revelation of Alexis Davis (Grahn) as Sam's biological mother was a turning point in the development of the character. The two characters had a rocky past filled with disdain, but the shocking revelation of their kinship forced the characters to co-exist. The newly formed mother-daughter relationship was very antagonistic in its early stages, but over time the two characters were able to reconcile and put the hate of their past behind them. Now the two characters share a close mother-daughter bond. The revelation of Alexis and Sam as mother and daughter was named the best revelation of the decade by SOAPnet. The unveiling of Alexis as Sam's mother led to widespread speculation as to the identity of Sam's biological father. For years, great fanfare was generated around this mystery in anticipation for the revelation of his identity. Seven years after Alexis was revealed as Sam's mother, General Hospital began dropping hints that they were ready to tackle the highly anticipated story of Sam's father. In 2013 General Hospital head-writer, Ron Carlivati addressed the ongoing mystery of Sam's father in an interview with TV Guide's Michael Logan. Widespread speculation about the identity of Sam's father was reignited when it was rumored that General Hospital was looking for a \\"name actor\\" to cast in the role of Sam's father. Rumors began to circulate naming Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan), Blackie Parrish (John Stamos) and Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) as potential candidates for Sam's father; Lindstrom having previously worked opposite Monaco as her father on the soap opera Port Charles. Another rumor emerged that veteran soap actor, Peter Reckell, who played Bo Brady on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives from 1983-2012, would be joining General Hospital in the role of Evan Jerome. It was widely speculated that Reckell was cast to play Sam's father, linking her to the Jerome crime family that was prominent on General Hospital in the 1980s. However, after weeks of speculation, Reckell addressed the rumors stating that he wasn't going back to Days of Our Lives or joining any other soap. In July 2013, ABC unveiled its latest General Hospital promo which showed Sam asking Alexis for the identity of her father. In the storyline, Sam's young son Danny has leukemia and they are trying to find as many potential bone marrow donors as possible. Following the promo's release, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis), took to her Twitter account to engage fans in a guessing game as to the identity of Sam's father. During the week the promo was released, it was announced that actor William deVry, who formerly starred on The Bold and the Beautiful as Storm Logan, and All My Children as Michael Cambias was joining General Hospital. There were reports that deVry had taped scenes with Maura West's Ava Jerome, leading to speculation that deVry could be joining the show as a Jerome and as Sam's father. deVry made his debut on July 30, 2013 under the alias Derek Wells, and it was soon revealed that he was actually Julian Jerome‚Äîson of mob boss Victor Jerome who was head of the Port Charles mob in the 1980s. Soon after the real identity of deVry's character was discovered, it was confirmed that deVry had been cast as Sam's father, when it was revealed that Sam's biological father is crime figure Julian Jerome. Reception When Monaco originated the role of Sam, her performance was well received by viewers and the network. In 2006, Monaco was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Sam. She also co-hosted the Daytime Emmy Awards that same year.

Founded in 1890, it has 6,195https://about.colum.edu/effectiveness/pdf/studentprofile_sp2019.pdf students pursuing degrees in more than 60 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Columbia College Chicago is the host institution of several affiliated educational, cultural, and research organizations, including the Center for Black Music Research, the Center for Book and Paper Arts, the Center for Community Arts Partnerships, the Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago, and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. Columbia College Chicago is not affiliated with Columbia University, Columbia College Hollywood, or any other Columbia College in the United States. History Columbia College Chicago was founded in 1890 as the Columbia School of Oratory by Mary A. Blood and Ida Morey Riley, both graduates of the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory (now Emerson College), in Boston, Massachusetts. Anticipating a strong need for public speaking at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas, Blood and Riley were inspired to open their school in the exposition city, Chicago, and adopt the exposition's name. Blood and Riley became the College's first co-presidents, until Riley died in 1901; Blood served in this capacity until her death in 1927. The women established a co-educational school that \\"should stand for high ideals, for the teaching of expression by methods truly educational, for the gospel of good cheer, and for the building of sterling good character\\" in the Stevens' Art Gallery Building, 24 East Adams Street. The school ran as a sole proprietary business from 1890 to 1904 when the school became incorporated by the state of Illinois. On May 5, 1904, the school incorporated itself again in order to change its name to the Columbia College of Expression, adding coursework in teaching to the curriculum. When Blood died in 1927, George L. Scherger assumed the office of presidency after serving as a former member on the Board of Directors. Under his leadership, Scherger signed the paperwork at the Board's annual meeting on April 14, 1928, to change the School's name to the Mary A. Blood School of Speech Arts.Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors, 1928, College Archives & Special Collections, Columbia College Chicago However, by April 30, 1928, the school reverted its name to the Columbia College of Expression by the Board of Directors, George L. Scherger, Herman H. Hegner, and Erme Rowe Hegner.1928 Articles of Incorporation, College Archives & Special Collections, Columbia College Chicago During Scherger's presidency, the College became an official sister institution with the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, a family-run school centered on training its students for teaching kindergarten. As the president of the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, Bertha Hofer Hegner assumed the role as the fourth president of Columbia College of Expression in 1929 when Scherger resigned to become an assistant pastor of St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church. Hegner served as the institutions' head, although due to illness, her son, Herman Hofer Hegner served as acting president of the institutions from 1930 until 1936. By 1934, College curriculum also focused on the growing field of radio broadcasting. Herman Hofer Hegner hired Norman Alexandroff, a radio programmer, in 1934 to develop a radio curriculum for the Colleges as both institutions were suffering financially. When Bertha Hofer Hegner retired in 1936 due to health reasons, she was made president emeritus of the institutions and Herman Hofer Hegner became the institutions' official president. During Herman Hofner Hegner's presidency, the Columbia College of Expression was advertised under different names including, Columbia College of Speech and Drama, the Radio Institute of Columbia School of Speech and Drama, and Columbia College of Speech, Drama, and Radio. However, the College was never incorporated under any of these names by the state of Illinois. As the radio program gained prominence, Alexandroff was named as the Vice President of the Columbia College of Expression and became a member on the Board of Directors at both institutions by 1937. The college left its partnership with the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, named Norman Alexandroff as its president, and filed the Columbia College of Expression as a not for profit corporation on December 3, 1943. On February 5, 1944, the College re-filed as a not for profit corporation and changed its name to Columbia College.1944 Articles of Incorporation Amendment, College Archives & Special Collections, Columbia College Chicago During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the college broadened its educational base to include television, journalism, marketing, and other mass-communication areas. Alexandroff also oversaw the development of the extension campuses of the School, Columbia College Pan-Americano in Mexico City, Mexico, and Columbia Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California. Both of these campuses became independent of its parent in the late 1950s. Prosperity was short lived, however, and by 1961, the college had fewer than 200 students and a part-time faculty of 25. Norman Alexandroff remained the president of the College until his death on May 26, 1960, and his son, Mirron (Mike) Alexandroff, assumed the role of President by 1961. Mike Alexandroff had worked at the College since 1947 and as president, he created a liberal arts college with a \\"hands-on minds-on\\" approach to arts and media education with a progressive social agenda. He established a generous admissions policy so that qualified high school graduates could attend college courses taught by some of the most influential and creative professionals in Chicago. For the next thirty years, Alexandroff worked to build the college into an urban institution that helped to change the face of higher education. With this renewed focus on building its academic program, the institution was awarded full accreditation in 1974 from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1984, received accreditation for its graduate programs. In 1975, when the college's enrollment exceeded 2,000, it purchased its first real estate, the building at 600 South Michigan Avenue (the building is now known as the Alexandroff Campus Center). At the time of Alexandroff's retirement in 1992, the college served 6,791 students and owned or rented more than of instructional, performance, and administrative space. From 1992 until 2000, John B. Duff, former commissioner of the Chicago Public Library and former chancellor of the Massachusetts Board of Regents of Higher Education, served as the college's president. On October 28, 1997, the college changed its name to Columbia College Chicago,1997 Articles of Incorporation Amendment, College Archives & Special Collections, Columbia College Chicago and the institution continued to expand its educational programs and add to its physical campus by purchasing available buildings in the South Loop. This played a significant part in its presence in the South Loop and downtown Chicago. Today, the college's campus occupies almost two dozen buildings and utilizes over 2.5 million square feet. In 2000, Dr. Warrick L. Carter became the college's president. An educator, jazz composer, and performing artist, Carter joined the college from The Walt Disney Company, where he spent four years as director of entertainment arts. Previously, he had spent 12 years at Berklee College of Music in Boston, one of the world's-largest independent schools of music, where he served as dean of faculty and then provost and vice president of academic affairs. Through 2010, under his leadership, the college created new student-based initiatives such as Manifest, the annual urban arts festival celebrating Columbia's graduating students, and ShopColumbia, a store where students can showcase and sell their work on campus; partnered with local universities to construct the University Center; purchased new campus buildings; added new curricula; and oversaw the college's first newly constructed building, the Media Production Center. Recently, the college has a growing program of international exchanges, including associations with Dublin Institute of Technology, the University of East London, and the Lorenzo de' Medici Italian International Institute. Through the vast diversity of students and graduates, the school brings a rich vision and a multiplicity of voices to American culture, encouraging students to \\"author the culture of their times\\". However, Columbia has not been exempt from internal and external criticism in recent years. During the 2011‚Äì12 school year, the college administration attempted to implement a set of sweeping changes to the college's curriculum, staffing policies, and overall institutional structure, through an initiative dubbed Blueprint  Prioritization. As the specifics of the changes and cutbacks came to light over the course of the school year, students and faculty from affected departments and majors vocalized their opposition to the cutbacks by staging protests during administrative meetings, mic-checking Interim Provost Louise Love during an open hearing about the proposed cutbacks, and circulating petitions calling for certain decisions, and even the entire process, to be reversed, citing \\"union busting\\" practices, consistent tuition hikes, and frequent, unexplained personnel changes across the college. Press coverage and local awareness of the college's troubles surrounding Prioritization increased rapidly after Deanna Issacs, a reporter for the Chicago Reader, was shut out of President Warrick Carter's annual State of the College Address to the student body, which had been advertised as \\"open to the public.\\" During the meeting, at which the President had been questioned extensively by students about cutbacks and tuition hikes, Carter appeared to lose his temper at one point, aggressively telling a student to \\"shut up,\\" in his response to a question about his salary, which exceeds $400,000 per year. In addition to the Reader, the grievances voiced over the Blueprint  Prioritization cutbacks received coverage in the Chicago Tribune, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and Time Out Chicago. As of September 2012, most of the proposed changes from Prioritization had yet to be implemented. Programs and departments that were at one point or another slated for cuts include the Center for Black Music Research, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble, the Ellen Stone Belic Institute for the Study of Women and Gender in the Arts and Media, the Fiction Writing Department (whose Chair was let go without explanation after 20+ years of service in April 2011, only to be reinstated just months later after a student uproar over the firing), the college's recycling program, which employed student workers to collect refuse, and the top-10 ranked Cultural Studies program, one of the few standalone undergraduate programs of its kind in the nation. On May 9, 2012, President Warrick Carter announced he would retire a year earlier than expected, stepping down at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 academic year. On July 1, 2013, Dr. Kwang-Wu Kim became Columbia College's 10th president. Dr. Kim holds a Doctorate of Musical Arts and an Artist Diploma from the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, where he studied with the legendary pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher and served as Fleisher's teaching associate. In 2013, Columbia College Chicago was ranked 13th best Film School in the country by The Hollywood Reporter. Columbia College Chicago is consistently ranked in The Hollywood Reporter's top 25 schools for music composition. In 2018, Hollywood reporter ranked Columbia College Chicago at number 13. =Presidents= Mary A. Blood, 1890‚Äì1927 Ida Morey Riley, 1890‚Äì1901 Rev. Dr. George L.

Campuses Alexandroff Campus Center Congress Campus Wabash Campus Building 1104 Wabash Campus Building Columbia has a nontraditional campus located in the South Loop and Near South Side of Chicago. The college owns sixteen academic, gallery/performance, administrative, and student residential buildings, and leases additional office and student residential space in four buildings. Most of the campus is contained in an area bounded by Ida B. Wells Drive, State Street, Roosevelt Road, and Michigan Avenue. Many of Columbia's buildings were built in the early 20th century and were acquired by the school as it expanded. The college also operates an intensive five-week Semester in Los Angeles program on the premises of Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California, for upper-level (80+ credit hours completed, 3.0 GPA) Cinema Art & Science, Television, Communication and Media Innovation, Music, and Business & Entrepreneurship students. =Alexandroff Campus Center= Located at 600 S. Michigan Avenue, Columbia College's Main Building was built in 1906‚Äì07 by Christian A. Eckstorm, an architect popular for his industrial and warehouse designs, to serve as the headquarters of the International Harvester Company. 600 S. Michigan was a modern skyscraper of its era, built with a steel skeleton, high-speed elevators, electric light, the most advanced mechanical systems available and a floor plan designed to maximize natural light for all of its interior office spaces. The 15-story brick-clad building with classical stone detailing has an Art Deco lobby that retains much of its original marble. In 1937 the building was purchased by the Fairbanks-Morse Company, makers of railroad locomotives, farm equipment and hydraulic systems. It was acquired by Columbia College in 1975. In its early years as the home of Columbia, it was adaptively reused to house classrooms, the library, darkrooms, studios, and an auditorium. When the campus expanded through the acquisition of other buildings, especially after 1990, some of these functions, such as the greatly expanded library, were moved to other locations, and the spaces were again adapted for new uses. The building continues to serve as the administrative center of the College, and houses the Museum of Contemporary Photography on its first two floors, along with the 180-seat Ferguson Memorial Theater, photography darkrooms, three professional television studios, film/video editing facilities, and classrooms. =33 East Ida B Wells Drive= The 33 East Ida B Wells Drive (formerly 33 East Congress) Building was built in 1925‚Äì26 by noted Chicago architect Alfred S. Alschuler, who designed the 1927 Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The seven-story brick and terra cotta \\"Congress-Wabash Building\\" was commissioned by Ferdinand W. Peck, Jr., a real estate developer, and initially housed a bank, offices, and recreation rooms that included dozens of pool tables. A national billiards championship was held here in 1938. By the 1940s, the building was known by the name of its major tenant, the Congress Bank. In the 1980s, it became the home of MacCormac College. Columbia leased space in the building starting in 1997 and purchased the structure in 1999. It currently houses administrative offices, classroom space and the college's radio station (WCRX 88.1 FM). The building is home to Columbia's American Sign Language-English Interpretation, Audio Arts & Acoustics, Journalism and Radio departments. =623 South Wabash Avenue= 623 South Wabash Avenue was built in 1895, designed by Solon S. Beman, architect of the industrial town of Pullman, one of the 19th century's largest, most complex, and globally famous planned industrial communities for the Pullman Palace Car Company. The ten-story 623 South Wabash building was originally built for the Studebaker Brothers Carriage Company of South Bend, Indiana as its Chicago regional office and warehouse facility. It was later owned by the Brunswick Corporation, makers of wood furnishings and built-in furniture for libraries, universities and a variety of public commercial and governmental facilities. By the late 19th century Brunswick became specialists in designing such entertainment furnishings as bars, billiards tables, and bowling alleys for drinking establishments nationwide. Subsequent owners are unknown. The building was acquired by Columbia in 1983 and now houses classrooms, academic offices, a computerized newsroom, sciences laboratories, art studios and two public gallery spaces. The building is also home to Anchor Graphics and ShopColumbia, a retail venue that sells the work of Columbia students and alumni artists, musicians, filmmakers etc. exclusively. =624 South Michigan Avenue= 624 South Michigan Avenue was built by Christian A. Eckstorm in 1908 as an eight-story building to house the Chicago Musical College, a concern headed by Florenz Ziegfeld Sr., father of Ziegfeld Follies producer Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. A seven-story addition was designed and built in 1922 by Alfred Alschuler. The building was renamed the Blum Building and housed the studios of a dance school and boutique women's clothiers. Tenants in the building in the 1920s included Augustus Eugene Bournique's dancing schools and two select women's clothiers, Stanley Korshak's Blackstone Shop and Blum's Vogue. Brick clad with classical detailing, this 15-story building retains its period marble and brass lobby. Columbia College acquired the building in 1990 and it now houses the College's five-story library, classrooms, departmental offices, student and faculty lounges and the College's bookstore =1104 South Wabash Avenue= 1104 South Wabash Avenue, built in 1891, is on the City of Chicago Landmarks (1996) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1980). Built by William LeBaron Jenney, acknowledged as the inventor of the skyscraper for his fire-proofed metal skeleton-frame designs, the Ludington Building represents his continuing experimentation as the first entirely terra cotta-clad skyscraper. The Ludington Building is also a rare survivor, one of only two extant loft buildings in Chicago built by Jenney. This eight-story, steel-frame building, boasting one of the finest examples of a terra-cotta clad fa√ßade, was commissioned by Mary Ludington Barnes for the American Book Company (1890), which was owned by her husband, Charles Barnes. At the time, Chicago was a national center for the publishing industry, as demonstrated by this building and many others, particularly those on Chicago's Printers Row, and including the former Lakeside Press Building owned by Columbia College. The American Book Company built the building to house its offices, printing presses, packaging and shipping operations. Its frame was built to withstand the weight and vibrations of the presses, which were originally located on the fourth through sixth floors, and to accommodate the anticipated eight-story addition that was never built. Its status as a manufacturing facility determined its form as a loft building, with a practical and efficient interior that had few elegant original elements. Its location, between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Grand Central Station at Harrison and Wells Streets and the Illinois Central Railroad's Central Station at Michigan Avenue and Roosevelt Road, made it ideal for the distribution of the company's products. The Ludington Building was owned by descendants of its original owners until 1960, although it was occupied by many different tenants, including the Pepsodent toothpaste company in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1960, it was sold to Warshawsky and Company, an autoparts firm, for use as a storage facility. The college purchased the building from Warshawsky in 1999. The Ludington currently houses the school's Center for Book and Paper Arts, a portion of the Film and Video Department, the Glass Curtain Gallery and the Conaway Multicultural Center. =Music Department= 1014‚Äì16 South Michigan Avenue was built in 1912 by Christian A. Eckstorm A red brick 4-story building with terra cotta detailing, this structure was erected by a developer as a speculative commercial building. During its first 30 years, it housed offices for a shingle distributor, a lumber company and an electrical parts manufacturer. In 1941, the building was rehabilitated for the Sherwood Conservatory of Music, founded in 1895 by William Hall Sherwood, a piano virtuoso, teacher and composer. The school's most famous alumna may be the comedian Phyllis Diller, who was a piano student at the Sherwood School in the 1930s but did not graduate. The building was acquired by Columbia College Chicago in 2007 and now houses the school's music department. The artistic, cultural and performance education tradition of this building, as it was adaptively reused since the 1940s, is continued today in the programs of the Music Center of Columbia College. =Getz Theater= 72 East 11th Street was built in 1929 by Holabird & Root, architects of notable Chicago skyscrapers such as the Chicago Board of Trade, the Palmolive Building and the 333 North Michigan Avenue Building. 72 East 11th Street, a six- story, limestone-clad Art Deco building, was originally owned by the Chicago Women's Club and housed the organization's meeting rooms, offices and a theater. Rich in history, it was the site for rallies in support of women's voting rights, efforts on behalf of compulsory education laws and fund raising for scholarships at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a women's dormitory at the University of Chicago. Subsequent owners and uses are unknown. Acquired by Columbia in 1980 as the school's Theater Center, it currently houses a renovated 400-seat theater, classrooms, and space for film and photography studios. = The Dance Center = Ballet room, 1979 The Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago is one of the region's education centers. Presenting companies have included: Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Lucky Plush Productions, Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan, Koosil-ja/danceKUMIKO, JUMP RHYTHM Jazz Project, Troika Ranch, Wayne McGregor Random Dance, and Hedwig Dances. 1306 S. Michigan Avenue, the Dance Center Building, was built in 1930 by architect Anker S. Graven. This sleek four-story Art Deco building, clad in limestone, was erected as the Paramount Publix Corporation as a film exchange, a venue for the presentation of films to the independent cinema operators throughout the Midwest who could rent them for exhibition at their theaters. The studio occupied the building up to about 1950, when it was taken over by the Equitable Life Assurance Company. In the 1970s it was known as the Seafarers International Union Building. The City of Chicago took possession of it in a tax sale in 1984, and used it for the Health Department's Environmental Health Clinic. The building was acquired by Columbia College in 1999 for use as the school's Dance Center. After extensive interior renovation and adaptation, the Dance Center opened its state-of-the- art educational and public performance facilities in the fall of 2000. Prior to the relocation to Michigan Avenue, the Dance Center was located at 4730 North Sheridan Road in a former movie theater in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago. The first floor housed the department office, lobby, dressing rooms, and the \\"main space\\", the primary dance studio. The second floor, accessed via a metal staircase in the back of the main space, held the ballet studio, the T'Chi room and music recording rooms. =Media Production Center= Located at 1600 South State Street, the Media Production Center (MPC) was completed in 2010 and was the college's first new-construction building in its history. Designed by Studio Gang Architects, the 35,500-square-foot facility serves students in the Cinema Art + Science, Interactive Arts & Media, and Television programs. It contains two film production soundstages, a motion-capture studio, digital labs, animating suites, a fabrication shop, and classrooms. It received a 2010 Citation of Merit in the Distinguished Building category from the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects. It has also received LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.  Environmental record  = Commitments to action on climate change = Columbia College Chicago signed onto the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2010. The college has met ACUPCC reporting deadlines that included submitting a formal Climate Action Plan and updating their Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The college has yet to set a climate neutrality date with the ACUPCC. = Energy profile = A Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory was completed in June 2011. The results show total CO2 equivalent emissions of 19,381.1 metric tonnes for the baseline year of 2010. The GHG Inventory was updated in May 2013. The total C02e emissions were 9,399 metric tonnes for the 2012 fiscal year. This reduction was due in part to the inclusion of purchased Renewable Energy Credits to offset emissions generated from purchased electricity. In conducting the GHG update, new methodologies were employed, emissions from purchased paper were used, and commuting data was collected from a streamlined transit survey. In 2011, the college hired the company Sustainametrics to complete the college's Sustainability Roadmap. This document was updated in September 2013 to reflect progress made since its initial adoption. The roadmap was submitted to the ACUPCC as the college's official Climate Action Plan. In 2012, the college decided to consolidate the Recycling Program into a sustainability-based program. The position of Recycling Manager became Sustainability Manager. Other part-time staff from the Recycling Program moved under the Sustainability Manager's direction into this new sustainability program. These part-time positions are responsible for maintaining the campus green spaces and managing diversion efforts such as compost and atypical recycling (batteries, technotrash). Campus recycling and waste collection is coordinated by its janitorial services contractor. = Energy investments = Columbia College has at least $8 million invested in the oil, gas and coal industry. Ken Gotsch, the former CFO of Columbia, reported that these companies include oil and gas companies Murphy Oil Corporation and Apache Corporation. Campus media The Columbia Chronicle is the college's award-winning weekly newspaper. Frequency TV is the college's television station. WCRX (88.1 FM) is the college's radio station. These outlets are run by students for class credit in their respective departments. However, students working at The Chronicle and Frequency TV can get paid for their work. The newspaper has won numerous awards, the most recent in 2009‚Äì10 as Best Weekly College Newspaper in the state, midwest and nation. Broadcast journalism students produce two television news shows that are broadcast each week on Frequency TV: Newsbeat and Metro Minutes. The student-produced Out on a Limb comedy television show has been nominated for a local Emmy Award. Radio students work on WCRX producing live mixes by local DJs, their own imaging, PSAs, and carrying select sport games. In 1998‚Äì1999, WCRX produced and broadcast Entertainment Primetime Weekly, a show that is produced in newsradio style. It has also broadcast the Emmy Awards. Journalism students, and others, report and write articles that are published on Chicagotalks.org, a community and citizen journalism website sponsored by the Journalism Department. Journalism Department students in the Magazine Workshop class produce a magazine each semester called Echo. AEMMP Records is the student-run record label. The staff develops an artist, produces an album, and markets the product throughout the course of an academic year. Other Columbia College Chicago publications include: Hair Trigger, Columbia Poetry Review, South Loop Review, Center for Black Music Research Journal, DEMO, and@LAS Student organizations In addition to the academic programs offered at the college, students engage in many extracurricular activities. There are several major organizations on campus run by students. They include XC3ND: Columbia College Show Choir, Producer's Guild of Columbia (PGC), the Student Government Association, the Student Organization Council, the Student Alumni Association, the Student Athletics Association (Renegades), Columbia Urban Music Association, ReachOut, Senior Class, the Student Programming Board, the Asian Student Organization, Students Supporting Israel, Hillel, the International Student Organization, the Columbia College Association of Black Journalists (CCABJ), Hispanic Journalists of Columbia (HJC) and Columbia Pride, the on- campus LGBT student group. Other notable organizations are the Latino Alliance and Black Student Union, two of the oldest student groups on campus. These student organizations work together to provide leadership training and experience to Columbia students so they will be ready to take on leadership roles in their future places of employment. = Student Government Association = The Student Government Association (SGA) consists of an Executive Board, the Senate, and committees. The Executive Board, or E-Board, consists of the President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Communications, Vice President of Finance, and the student representative to the College Board of Trustees. The Senate consists of student representatives from each of the colleges academic departments, eight senators \\"at-large\\" who represent the college community as a whole, two senators who represent the college's vast commuter population, one senators from the Student Organization Council, one senator from the Student Athletics Association, and two senators from the Residence Hall Association. From those Senators there are six committees, each with a different focus. SGA Senate meetings are open to the public and are held on Tuesdays at 5 p.m. during the academic year. Notable alumni and faculty members Reception, reputation, awards and criticism In 2013, Animation Career Review ranked Columbia College Chicago as the Midwest's Top Animation and Game Design School. Nationally, Columbia College Chicago is ranked #8. In 2010, Gamepro listed Columbia College Chicago in their list of \\"6 Game Design Schools to Watch\\".

An Egyptian dish that originated during the mid-19th century, the dish combines Italian, Indian and Middle Eastern culinary elements. Koshary is made of rice, macaroni, and lentils mixed together, topped with a spiced tomato sauce and garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and crispy fried onions. It is often served with sprinklings of garlic juice; garlic vinegar and hot sauce are optional.  Etymology and spelling  \\"Koshary\\" comes from a spelling variation of the Indian dish khichdi, as khichri. The most popular English spelling in Egypt is spelled as Koshary, other variations of the spelling are Kushari also Koshari, and Kosheri. History Koshary originated in the mid-19th century, during a time when Egypt was a multicultural country in the middle of an economic boom. It consists of fried onions, lentils, rice, macaroni and lemon sauce. It is somewhat related to Italian cuisine and to an Indian dish made only from rice and lentils, khichdi, but the Egyptian dish has more ingredients and flavors, especially the local Egyptian sauce giving it the unique taste the dish is popular for. Some believe it was first made during the British occupation of Egypt, when Indians and Egyptians were common workers in the houses of the British. It is rumored that they used to boil leftovers from the dinner and that the Egyptians came up with the idea to add tomato sauce to the dish to add more flavor. Over time, the dish has evolved through Egyptian citizens, then Egyptian soldiers. Koshary used to be sold on food carts in its early years, and was introduced to restaurants later. This dish is widely popular among workers and laborers, and the dish is well-suited to mass catering events such as conferences. It may be prepared at home, and is also served at roadside stalls and restaurants all over Egypt; some restaurants specialize in koshary to the exclusion of other dishes, while others feature it as one item among many. As traditionally prepared koshary does not contain any animal products, it can be considered vegan, as long as all frying uses vegetable oil.  Variants  The Alexandrian Koshary is very different from the known recipe as it changes visually and in taste, the process of cooking includes yellow lentils and rice ,it also uses curry and cumin in the rice which makes them have a uniform color, it Includes Egyptian Rolled eggs as well which is boiled then fried eggs in ghee or butter, As well as lightly pickled Tomatoes instead of the sauce and French Fries on the side. The dish with the Koshary name has seen some popularity in other Arab countries in recent years, especially in the Persian Gulf region and Yemen, There's adjustments and changes based on each country or region, the variations include adding grilled vegetables and changing the rice type to Basmati cooked either white or yellow, recipes of that region uses other shapes of macaroni, the recipes could include chicken too which makes it close to Kabsa in some cases. The dish is served in Japanese carts and has some additions added on top of the original recipe, the additions are, basil chicken, raw tomatoes, sour cream, fried eggs, cheddar cheese sauce, avocado slices, and spicy powder with jalape√±o.

It is a murder mystery and political thriller set in a near-future federal Europe where no-one can be \\"prejudiced from employment for reason of age, race, creed or incompitence \\". Consequently, much of the population demonstrates an extreme lack of competence in their occupations.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview26 The novel tells the story of a detective working for an unnamed secret agency, with a variety of identities within various law enforcement agencies (two examples being Europol and the Police Corruption Investigation Department). His real name remains a mystery but he commonly uses the pseudonym Harry Salt. The story starts with the apparent death of his former mentor (Klingferm) in an apparent elevator accident. He suspects foul play, and his investigations lead him around various states of Europe. In the course of these investigations, he seems to be tracked by an unknown stalker. On the way, he is hindered by the fact that practically everyone he meets has a serious character flaw and/or mental deficiency. Another ongoing problem is his inability to acquire or hang onto a decent pair of shoes, primarily as all shoes in the \\"United States of Europe\\" are made of vegetable matter. A number of new mental disorders have apparently been classified in the book's universe, such as Sexually Inappropriate Response and Non-Specific Stupidity. Examples of incompetence in the world around the agent are: *Records that are incomplete, contradict other documents, or are simply false (such as death certificates issued for living people). *Police who obliterate all evidence by walking casually through a crime scene. *Inaccurate local guides and transport. *People who cannot work the basic equipment they are paid to use. The plot appears to be based on the film The Third Man. The film is mentioned in the drunken conversation between Salt and Klingferm near the start of the book. Characters * Harry Salt/Harry Tequila/Harry Pepper/Cardew Vascular: The main protagonist. Years of dealing with stupidity have left him somewhat cynical. One of the few characters who is not incompetent or mentally retarded, he has learnt to exploit society's incompetence to aid his investigations. He seems to be one of very few people who can do anything well, although he remarks that most people who do get nowhere, which may be one of the reasons he has learned to hate his job to the point where he resigns at the end of the book. Harry's real name is not given, although his mentor Klingferm refers to him as Harry Salt. His pseudonyms are compromised throughout the novel. *Dick Klingferm: Harry's former mentor and fellow agent. During the story, he is presumed dead when an elevator supposedly kills him along with several other people. Harry tracks down his killer, only to find out it to be Klingferm himself. He explains he is a deep undercover American agent out to destroy any possibilities of the United States of Europe expanding to include Russia. Harry electrocutes Klingferm, then shoots him in the head, blowing out a large piece of his brain. *Captain Zuccho: An Italian police captain who, by his own admission, sometimes becomes \\"a bit too frisky\\"; he has serious difficulty controlling his anger, even at one point firing off several rounds from his gun when asked to calm down. Although often irrational and angry he has been shown to genuinely desire to uphold the law and his anger is often a result of believing his work is being interfered with. His overreaction make him appear less rational but to Harry's surprise he is not without some skills as a police officer he is able to track Harry down when he discovers his I.D's are fake and again when he does not show up for his trial after being given bail. He witnesses Harry and Klingferm's encounter and is able to intervene. He never fully learns about who Harry works for but agrees to forget about the encounter. He is reputedly on prozac, but despite this he is still unable to control his anger. He eventually saves Harry's life at the end, with even more swearing. *Gina Pallister: A guest liaison who suffers from SIR (Sexually Inappropriate Response), and an object of Harry's lust. Harry initially believes her to be a figment of his imagination, but realises that he doesn't have \\"that good an imagination\\". Harry manages to convince her to go out on a date,but fails to turn up because he is arrested. At the end of the book, however, Harry states that he has \\"a date so hot, it could cut through bank vaults\\", implying that he managed to convince her to go on another date. Gina is showing to desire to do a good job in her role and worries her condition makes her bad at it. *Mamma: An old woman who was widowed when the authorities declared her (still-living) husband legally dead. She helps heal Harry during his ordeal (such as jumping out of a car, and being almost CPRed to death) with a special soup and bandages, akin to voodoo. Later it's revealed the meat inside the soup is actually inspectors sent to her farm. *Pappa: Mamma's (late) husband. A clerical error resulted in him being legally dead. He was going to protest about this, but after welfare cheques and compensation came through, he agreed to live in the shed instead, resentfully defending his existence. Harry eventually gives him his false identity of Cadrew Vascular to enable him to be a \\"living\\" person again. *Twinkle: A 100+ year old male lap dancer hired by Klingferm to meet with Harry; this was actually a ruse to lead Harry into Klingferm's trap. *Wolfie: A professional henchman with very bad breath and a fondness for sadism. His weapons of choice are a stiletto blade, a Derringer pistol (which Harry surmises is only useful for shooting people in the eye sockets at point blank range), and a police stun baton with the safety removed, making its charge incredibly powerful. Harry kills him by driving his nose into his brain. *Dr Rutter: A coroner whose hobbies include stitching faces to the buttocks of cadavers. *Hinton Wheeler: An ex legal assistant who visited a prison Harry was incarcerated in. Apparently he is 'not meant to be there'. He describes the events as coming to visit a client, then finding out the company had fired him, so his pass to leave wasn't valid, but he had not committed a crime and so could not be imprisoned to be released, thereby being stuck. Harry solves the problem by making him assault one of the guards to commit a crime, and he thanks Harry as he gets electrocuted and beaten.

Clockwise from center: bleomycin, an antitumor antibiotic; vincristine, a spindle poison; dacarbazine, an alkylating agent; cyclophosphamide, a nitrogen mustard; doxorubicin, an anthracycline; and etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor. The era of cancer chemotherapy began in the 1940s with the first use of nitrogen mustards and folic acid antagonist drugs. The targeted therapy revolution has arrived, but many of the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.  Beginnings  The beginnings of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy can be traced directly to the German introduction of chemical warfare during World War I. Among the chemical agents used, mustard gas was particularly devastating. Although banned by the Geneva Protocol in 1925, the advent of World War II caused concerns over the possible re-introduction of chemical warfare. Such concerns led to the discovery of nitrogen mustard, a chemical warfare agent, as an effective treatment for cancer. Two pharmacologists from the Yale School of Medicine, Louis S. Goodman and Alfred Gilman, were recruited by the US Department of Defense to investigate potential therapeutic applications of chemical warfare agents. Goodman and Gilman observed that mustard gas was too volatile an agent to be suitable for laboratory experiments. They exchanged a nitrogen molecule for sulfur and had a more stable compound in nitrogen mustard. A year into the start of their research, a German air raid in Bari, Italy led to the exposure of more than 1000 people to the SS John Harvey's secret cargo composed of mustard gas bombs. Dr. Stewart Francis Alexander, a lieutenant colonel who was an expert in chemical warfare, was subsequently deployed to investigate the aftermath. Autopsies of the victims suggested that profound lymphoid and myeloid suppression had occurred after exposure. In his report, Dr. Alexander theorized that since mustard gas all but ceased the division of certain types of somatic cells whose nature was to divide fast, it could also potentially be put to use in helping to suppress the division of certain types of cancerous cells. Using that information, Goodman and Gilman reasoned that this agent could be used to treat lymphoma, a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set up an animal model by establishing lymphomas in mice and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, Gustaf Lindskog, they injected a related agent, mustine (the prototype nitrogen mustard anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's tumor masses. Although the effect lasted only a few weeks, and the patient had to return for another set of treatment, that was the first step to the realization that cancer could be treated by pharmacological agents. Publication of the first clinical trials was reported in 1946 in the New York Times. Antifolates father of modern chemotherapy. Shortly after World War II, a second approach to drug therapy of cancer began. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School, studied the effects of folic acid on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a vitamin crucial for DNA metabolism (he did not know the significance of DNA at that time), had been discovered by Lucy Wills, when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by Harriett Kiltie and Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle Laboratories. These analogues ‚Äî first aminopterin and then amethopterin (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear ‚Äî antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the New England Journal of Medicine was met with incredulity and ridicule. In 1947, Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Babe Ruth, who was battling nasopharyngeal cancer, became one of the first human subjects of pteroyl triglutamate (also known by its brand name Teropterin, and similar to aminopterin) treatment. Dr. Richard Lewisohn of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York administered the drug, and over the course of several months, Ruth's condition began to improve. However, Ruth died the following year. In 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer. Wright's group were the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a cancer of the marrow. Several years later at the National Cancer Institute, Roy Hertz and Min Chiu Li then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, discovering that methotrexate alone could cure choriocarcinoma (1958), a germ-cell malignancy that originates in trophoblastic cells of the placenta. In 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in mycosis fungoides. 6-MP Joseph Burchenal, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, with Farber's help, started his own methotrexate study and found the same effects. He then decided to try to develop anti-metabolites in the same way as Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the Burroughs Wellcome Co. in Tuckahoe, many purine analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug. Vinca Alkaloids The Eli Lilly natural products group found that alkaloids of the Madagascar periwinkle (Vinca rosea), originally discovered in a screen for anti-diabetic drugs, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine) was later shown to be due to their ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division. National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center The NCI, headed by Dr. John R. Heller Jr., lobbied the United States Congress for financial support for second-generation chemotherapy research. In response, Congress created a National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center (NCCSC) at the NCI in 1955. This was the first federal programme to promote drug discovery for cancer ‚Äì unlike now, most pharmaceutical companies were not yet interested in developing anticancer drugs. The NCCSC developed the methodologies and crucial tools (like cell lines and animal models) for chemotherapeutic development. Combination chemotherapy In 1965, a major breakthrough in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs concurrently it would be more difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone ‚Äî together referred to as the POMP regimen ‚Äî and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-M√ºnster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease. This approach was extended to the lymphomas in 1963 by Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone ‚Äî known as the MOPP regimen ‚Äî could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Currently, nearly all successful cancer chemotherapy regimens use this paradigm of multiple drugs given simultaneously, called combination chemotherapy or polychemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy As predicted by studies in animal models, drugs were most effective when used in patients with tumours of smaller volume. Another important strategy developed from this ‚Äî if the tumour burden could be reduced first by surgery, then chemotherapy may be able to clear away any remaining malignant cells, even if it would not have been potent enough to destroy the tumor in its entirety. This approach was termed \\"adjuvant therapy\\". Emil Frei first demonstrated this effect ‚Äî high doses of methotrexate prevented recurrence of osteosarcoma following surgical removal of the primary tumour. 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase, was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of Bernard Fisher, chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of Gianni Bonadonna, working in the Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano, Italy, proved that adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival ‚Äî particularly in more advanced cancer. Drug discovery at the NCI and elsewhere =Zubrod's initiatives= In 1956, C. Gordon Zubrod, who had formerly led the development of antimalarial agents for the United States Army, took over the Division of Cancer Treatment of the NCI and guided development of new drugs. In the two decades that followed the establishment of the NCCSC, a large network of cooperative clinical trial groups evolved under the auspices of the NCI to test anticancer agents. Zubrod had a particular interest in natural products, and established a broad programme for collecting and testing plant and marine sources, a controversial programme that led to the discovery of taxanes (in 1964) and camptothecins (in 1966). Both classes of drug were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Monroe Wall at the Research Triangle Institute. =Taxanes= Paclitaxel (Taxol) was a novel antimitotic agent that promoted microtubule assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and could only be obtained from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree, which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in ovarian cancer therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol. =Camptothecins= Another drug class originating from the NCI was the camptothecins. Camptothecin, derived from a Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, irinotecan, won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers. =Platinum-based agents= Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was discovered by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing to try to explain this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact ‚Äî the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity. =Nitrosoureas= A second group with an NCI contract, led by John Montgomery at the Southern Research Institute, synthesized nitrosoureas, an alkylating agent which cross- links DNA. Fludarabine phosphate, a purine analogue which has become a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery. =Anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins= Other effective molecules also came from industry during the period of 1970 to 1990, including anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins ‚Äî both of which inhibited the action of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis. Supportive care during chemotherapy As is obvious from their origins, the above cancer chemotherapies are essentially poisons. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side- effects that limited the doses which could be administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized that the ability to manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy. Several examples are noteworthy. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause profound suppression of the bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with platelet and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover. Several practical factors are also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The development of new drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was ondansetron) was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. Hickman lines and PICC lines) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy. Bone marrow transplantation  One important contribution during this period was the discovery of a means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's bone marrow was first harvested, the chemotherapy administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed autologous bone marrow transplantation, was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced breast cancer. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and autologous transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by autologous bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. Autologous transplantation continues to be used as a component of therapy for a number of other hematologic malignancies. Antihormone therapy The hormonal contribution to several categories of breast cancer subtypes was recognized during this time, leading to the development of pharmacological modulators (e.g. of oestrogen) such as tamoxifen. Targeted therapy CML, inhibited by _imatinib_ (small molecule). Molecular genetics has uncovered signalling networks that regulate cellular activities such as proliferation and survival. In a particular cancer, such a network may be radically altered, due to a chance somatic mutation. Targeted therapy inhibits the metabolic pathway that underlies that type of cancer's cell division. =Tyrosine kinase inhibitors= The classic example of targeted development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been known for a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect. =Monoclonal antibodies= Another branch in targeted therapy is the increasing use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. \\"Humanization\\" of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed the creation of a new family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. Trastuzumab, a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example. Effectiveness The discovery that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks as one of the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood ALL, testicular cancer, and Hodgkins disease, previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including testicular cancer, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and some leukemias. It has also proved effective in the adjuvant setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, among others. The overall impact of chemotherapy on cancer survival can be difficult to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the United States, overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999. Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have metastasized.

History  The Society was established in 1805 as Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, meeting in two rooms in barristers‚Äô chambers at Gray's Inn and then moving to Lincoln's Inn Fields where it stayed for 25 years. In 1834 the Society moved to Berners Street and was granted a Royal Charter by King William IV. In 1889 under the leadership of Sir John MacAlister, a Building Committee chaired by Timothy Holmes supervised the move of the quarters of the Society from Berners Street to 20 Hanover Square. In 1905 an eleven-member committee headed by Sir Richard Douglas Powell organised the celebration of the Society's centenary. Two years later the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London came together with seventeen specialist medical societies and, with a supplementary Royal Charter granted by Edward VII, became the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1910 the Society acquired the site on the corner of Wimpole Street and Henrietta Place, which was opened by King George V and Queen Mary in May 1912.

The Society hosts the annual Ellison-Cliffe Lecture concerning the advancement of medicine, along with the associated award of a medal. Past presenters/recipients include Sir Walter Bodmer, Lord George Porter, Sir Colin Blakemore and Kevin Warwick. The RSM also has a number of awards and prizes for students and trainees.\\"RSM prizes and awards\\" RSM prizes and awards There are over 70 prizes available for trainees, worth a total of around ¬£60,000. The annual Ellison-Cliffe Travelling Fellowship of ¬£15,000 is open to Fellows of the Royal Society of Medicine working in the UK or Ireland who are of specialist registrar or lecturer grade or equivalent or who are consultants within 3 years of their first consultant appointment. The prize covers expenses for travel abroad in pursuit of further study, research or clinical training relevant to the applicant's current interests. The History of Medicine Society's prestigious Norah Schuster prize is awarded annually to an essay in the history of medicine.{{Cite weburl=https://www.rsm.ac.uk/sections/history-of-medicine- society/ Public information While the main function of the Royal Society of Medicine is to provide ongoing education to healthcare professionals and students, the Society offers a variety of services to the public. A series of public events, including lectures and topical debates, allows the RSM to provide a forum for informed debate amongst the public. There is also a range of meetings for school students, including an annual meeting for those considering a career in medicine, together with Christmas and Easter Lectures. Library The RSM Library is open to members of the public, who can visit its exhibitions and become temporary members to make use of its reference facilities. The Library represents one of the largest postgraduate biomedical collections in Europe and contains around 600,000 volumes. This includes William Harvey's Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinisin animalbus.

She is both the earliest recorded female artist and the first known pastelist working in the English colonies, and is the first portraitist known to have worked in what would become the southern United States. Life Both the date and place of Johnston's birth are unknown; it has been suggested, and is generally accepted, that she was born in northwestern France, near the town of Rennes. Her parents, both French Huguenots, were Francis (possibly C√©zar) and Suzanna de Beaulieu, and the family immigrated to London in either 1685 or 1687. Miles instead states that she was born Henrietta de Branlien in either England or Ireland; she does, however, agree with the theory that the artist was of Huguenot origin. In 1694 Henrietta married Robert (possibly William) Dering, fifth son of Sir Edward Dering, 2nd Baronet,, and his wife Mary; she and her husband then moved to Ireland. It was during this time that Johnston began to draw pastels. Her earliest portraits depicted a number of powerful people to whom she was related by marriage; among these were John Perceval, later to become Earl of Egmont, and one of the Earls of Barrymore. Her earliest surviving pastel dates to 1704. Henriette Charlotte Chastaigner (Mrs. Nathaniel Broughton), Gibbes Museum of Art Dering's husband died in about 1704, leaving Henrietta a widow with two daughters. In 1705 she married again, this time to Anglican clergyman Gideon Johnston, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin then serving as the vicar at Castlemore. Two years later, he was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to serve as commissary of the Church of England in North and South Carolina and the Bahama Islands. He was also to serve as rector of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Charleston. The couple's time in the colonies was hard; Johnston was frequently writing the Society to request payment of his salary, which was often delayed, and their lives were further hampered by illness, lack of supplies, and distance from family. In one of his letters to his patron Gilbert Burnet, written in 1709, Johnston mentions that \\"were it not for the assistance my wife gives by drawing of Pictures (which can last but a little time in a place so ill peopled) I should not be able to live\\", indicating that Henrietta had again taken up her drawing to augment the couple's income. Another letter, dated a year later, reveals that she had run out of drawing materials and suffered \\"a long and tedious Sickness\\". Johnston made one return trip to England, in 1711‚Äì1712; her husband, too, returned there once, from 1713 to 1715. He died in a boating accident in 1716, not long after returning to Charleston. Anna Cuyler (Mrs. Anthony) Van Schaick, ca. 1725, pastel, in the New York State Museum Little is known of Johnston's later life in the colonies. She is known to have traveled at some point to New York City, as four portraits dated 1725 exist depicting members of a family from that city.The family is that of Colonel John Moore, formerly of South Carolina; what link may have existed between them and Johnston is unknown. She returned to Charleston at some time before her death in 1729. Johnston and her second husband are buried together in the cemetery of St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston. One of her daughters by her first marriage, Mary Dering, later became lady-in-waiting to the daughters of George II. A suggestion has been made that Johnston was related to the painter and dancing master William Dering, who migrated to Charleston from Williamsburg, Virginia in 1749, but this is not generally accepted. Style It is unknown whether or not Johnston studied painting and drawing; however, given the sophistication of her work, it is likely that she did indeed receive some form of training. Similarities between her pastels and the works of Irish artist Edmund Ashfield and of Edward Luttrell indicate that she may have studied with them at some point. In pose and coloring, many of Johnston's portraits strongly resemble those of Sir Godfrey Kneller, which at the time were greatly in fashion in the United Kingdom and the colonies. Her pastels from Ireland are drawn in deep earth tones, while those from her time in South Carolina are generally lighter and smaller, due likely to the precious nature of her materials, which had to be imported. The Irish works, which show the most attention to detail of all her works, depict sitters at three-quarter length, as do the earliest of her Carolina pastels. Johnston's American female subjects are usually shown wearing chemises, while the male subjects are drawn mostly in street clothes; some of the latter are depicted wearing armor. Each subject is shown sitting erect, with the head frequently turned at a slight angle from the body and towards the viewer. The faces are typically dominated by large oval eyes. Works dating to after her second husband's death are less finished; details of clothing are less well-defined and colors are less saturated, suggesting either that the artist was running out of materials or that she was working at greater speed to complete commissions. Johnston usually signed her portraits on their wooden backing, noting her name, the location of completion, and the date of completion in order. A typical signature is the inscription on the reverse of her portrait of Philip Perceval: Henrietta Dering Fecit / Dublin Anno 1704. Johnston was almost exclusively a portraitist; the only landscapes attributed to her hand are the backgrounds of a pair of children's portraits from New York, which are also her only known portraits of children. About forty portraits by Johnston are known to survive; many have preserved their original frames and backboards, on which her signature may be found. These mostly depict members of her social circle and, later, of her husband's Charleston congregation, such as Colonel William Rhett. Many of her South Carolina portraits depict members of Huguenot families that had settled in the New World, including the Prioleaus, Bacots (including Pierre Bacot and his first wife Marianne Fleur Du Gue) and duBoses (including Judith DuBose). Today, a number of her works are held by the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, which has developed an interactive online exhibition dedicated to her work;Henrietta Johnston Interactive . At the Gibbes Museum of Art. Retrieved March 12, 2015. other pieces may be seen in the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Greenville County Museum of Art. Johnston is not known to have worked in oils, but one of her portraits was copied at some point by Jeremiah Theus. Nine portraits, each depicting members of the Southwell and Perceval families, were owned by American preservationist Jim Williams and displayed at his Mercer House in Savannah, Georgia. Seven are inscribed \\"Dublin, Ireland\\" and are dated from 1704 to 1705.

In partnership with his cousin Richard Trevithick, the inventor of the \\"high pressure\\" steam engine, and the entrepreneur Davis Giddy, Vivian financed the production of the first steam carriage and was granted a joint patent for high pressure engines for stationary and locomotive use in March 1802. Early life He was born at Vellansaundry, Camborne on 30 November 1759, the second son of John Vivian and his wife Anne. By 1790, he was had set up a business selling supplies to miners. By 1795 he had been appointed as the manager of the Stray Park Mine near Cambourne. In 1798, Vivian became the manager of Dolcoath Mine, and this was where he first worked with Ricard Trevithick, who was the mine engineer. Work with Trevithick In 1801, Richard Trevithick completed his first full-sized road locomotive in Camborne, demonstrating it to the public on Christmas Eve with Vivian at the controls. The first day it ran about the streets and up the very steep Beacon Hill. The next day it went down to the village of Crane so that Vivian's family, who lived there, might see it. In a further trial, one week later, the machine overturned in a rut. It was dragged into a shed while Trevithick and Vivian had lunch at a nearby inn; on their return the boiler had run dry, setting fire to the machine's timber frame. A second locomotive was tried in Camborne and, at the beginning of 1803, in London. It was shipped to London in the Little Catherine, a temporary packet commanded by John Vivian (1784‚Äì1871), nephew of Andrew Vivian. In August 1803, Mr. Felton, of Leather Lane, London, was paid for building the coachwork. William West assembled the machine, under the supervision of Trevithick and Vivian. It ran successfully, although receiving surprisingly little lasting public attention, but again the state of the road surfaces of the time put paid to the enterprise: the carriage was put out of action with a twisted frame. In the face of this setback Vivian withdrew from the partnership. The London Steam Carriage by Trevithick and Vivian, demonstrated in London in 1803.

She received the Lomonosov Gold Medal in 2002. She is the author of more than two hundred scientific works, among which are six monographs.  Biography  Ladyzhenskaya was born and grew up in the small town of Kologriv, the daughter of a mathematics teacher who is credited with her early inspiration and love of mathematics. The artist Gennady Ladyzhensky was her grandfather's brother, also born in this town. In 1937 her father, Aleksandr Ivanovich Lad√Ωzhenski, was arrested by the NKVD and executed as an \\"enemy of the people\\". Ladyzhenskaya completed high school in 1939, unlike her older sisters who weren't permitted to do the same. She was not admitted to Leningrad State University due to her father's status. Ladyzhenskaya attended a pedagogical institute then, after the German invasion of June 1941, taught school in Kologriv. She was finally admitted to Moscow State University in 1943 and graduated in 1947. Finally admitted to Leningrad State University, she received her PhD there under Sergei Sobolev and Vladimir Smirnov in 1951 and began teaching in the physics department in Leningrad in 1950. She received a second doctorate from Moscow State University in 1953. In 1954, she joined the mathematical physics laboratory of the Steklov Institute and became its head in 1961. Ladyzhenskaya had a love of arts and storytelling, counting writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and poet Anna Akhmatova as her friends. She was once a member of the city council, had philanthropic efforts, and repeatedly risked her personal safety and career to aid those oppressed by the Soviet regime. Ladyzhenskaya suffered from various eye problems in her later years, and relied on special pencils to do her work.

Its pub, the Navigation Inn, was once owned by Coronation Street actress Pat Phoenix. The village lies almost from Whaley Bridge and about southeast of Manchester.  Name change  The village was originally called Bugsworth, from the Old English Bucga's Worth (\\"Bucga's Enclosure\\"), but in the early 20th century some residents began to dislike the name of their village; their cause was championed by the local vicar, Dr J R Towers, and the village school headmaster, Mr W T Prescott. As a result of the efforts of these two residents, Bugsworth officially became Buxworth on 16 April 1930. In 1999 the local High Peak Borough Council spent ¬£350 to organise a ballot of the 600 members of the local population. The result was 233 to 139 to keep the name as Buxworth. However, the village is still generally referred to as 'Buggy' by locals.  Transport  The Peak Forest Canal terminates here at Bugsworth Basin (the renaming of the village had no effect on the name of the canal basin), which was re-opened on 26 March 2005 having been restored by the Inland Waterways Protection Society, and, once again, the canal now ends at its original terminus. It is used entirely for recreational purposes. The canal never reached Peak Forest but limestone from quarries near Dove Holes was, between 1796 and 1922, transported to the basin by way of the Peak Forest Tramway - a distance of some six miles. Its trackbed can still be discerned in places (e.g. at Whitehough, close to Chinley, and just beyond the end of the bypass on the way south to Buxton). A main railway line (Sheffield to Manchester) passes north of the village. The railway was originally the Midland Railway's main line to London, built in 1867 as part of the extension of its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, and in 1894 the Midland built the line from Dore, which today is the Hope Valley line. Almost as soon as it was built a landslip destroyed the viaduct. Some four hundred men made drainage channels and built a new timber viaduct, which served until 1885 when the present one was built. A tunnel to the north of the station collapsed during building, trapping a gang of navvies, who were close to death by the time they were rescued. In 1903, when the line upgraded to four tracks, the tunnel was opened out into a cutting. Buxworth station seen from the road There was a station at Buxworth, also originally called Bugsworth, renamed on 4 June 1930, seven weeks after the village was renamed. This closed on 15 September 1958, but the building and parts of the platforms remain to this day. All through the station's existence it has experienced a peculiar anomaly in that reconstructing the collapsed viaduct also involved realigning the railway line a little way to the north. As a result, the tracks have always run past the \\"wrong side\\" of the station building, where the approach road was originally intended to be, with a new approach road hastily laid where the tracks were originally supposed to be. The old station house is owned by Burnage School For Boys in Manchester and is opened for visits frequently. The village is split into two by the Whaley Bridge-Chapel-en-le- Frith bypass (A6), constructed in the 1980s. Local murder John Cotton, the last man to be hanged in Derby Gaol in 1898, murdered his wife in Bugsworth basin after drinking heavily in the Rose & Crown (now demolished) at Bugsworth. School Buxworth Primary School, founded in 1884, is the only school remaining in Buxworth. The school is currently headed by Paul Bertram and was previously co-headed by Jennifer Rackstraw and Louise Moore. Their current Ofsted rating is 'Good'.  Sport  Buxworth cricket team, which was founded around 1848, play in the Derbyshire & Cheshire League. Former Buxworth player Alan (Bud) Hill went on to play for Derbyshire for over fourteen seasons, scoring more than 12,000 first-class runs at an average of 30.89. Buxworth Football Club, nicknamed the Canal Men, play in the Premier division of the Hope Valley Amateur League with Buxworth Reserves competing in the Premier Division. Links with the United States Brierley Green adjoins Buxworth and in the early 19th century it was the home of the Clayton family. The eldest son, Joel Henry Clayton, emigrated to the US to live with an uncle at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Other members of the Clayton family followed him and eventually they settled in a valley at the foot of Mount Diablo, some 30 miles from San Francisco, California where they founded Clayton. Buxworth and Clayton are now twinned.

Biography Seixas Santos was born on 20 March 1936 in Lisbon, Portugal. Studied Historical-philosophical Sciences in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon. In 1958, he started to work as a film critic. Studied in Paris, at the Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques (IDHEC) in 1962 and, in the next year, at the London Film School.

In 1970, he was one of the founders of the Portuguese Cinema Center. Brandos Costumes, his first feature-film, shot between 1972 and 1975 and written together with the writers Lu√≠sa Neto Jorge and Nuno J√∫dice, draws a line between everyday life of a medium bourgeoisie family and the path of the regime of the military coup of the 28 May 1926.

He was born in Funchal. Biography Ant√≥nio Cohen da Cunha Telles was born on February 26, 1935, in Funchal, Madeira. He studied Medicine in the University of Lisbon. He went to Paris around 1956, studying film- making at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques (IDHEC), graduating in 1961. Back to Portugal, he ran a newspaper called Imagens de Portugal (Images of Portugal), and assumed leading functions at the Cinema Services of State Entities. His directing debut was made with the documentary Os Transportes (1962), and starts activity as a producer, becoming one of the essential names of the Portuguese New Cinema (Novo Cinema) movement. He produces Os Verdes Anos (1963) by Paulo Rocha and Belarmino (1964) by Fernando Lopes. In 1970, Cunha Telles directed his first feature-film, O Cerco. Meanwhile, he established a distribution company (Animat√≥grafo) which becomes responsible for a revolution in the kind of cinema seen in Portugal in the first half of the 1970s. Eisenstein, Tanner, Jorge Sanjines, Litt√≠n, Glauber Rocha, Vigo, Gilles Carle, Karmitz, among others, became more familiar to the Portuguese audience through that distributor. During the 1970s, Telles directed three films: Meus Amigos (1974) and Continuar a Viver (1976) signed by himself, As Armas e o Povo (1975) together with other directors. In the end of the decade, Cunha Telles is found high placed as the leader of the Portuguese Cinema Institute and the Tobis Portuguesa. In 1983, returns to production, since the Animat√≥grafo firm was divided in one sector of distribution (still in activity, conducted by Ren√©e Gagnon - the current Marfilmes) and one sector of production, headed by himself (together with his daughter Pandora da Cunha Telles - the current Filmes de Fundo), which is dedicated to its own productions as well as assuring executive productions of foreign films partially shot in Portugal, counting since that date with a large number of productions, with films directed by names like Jos√© Fonseca e Costa, Eduardo Geada, Joaquim Leit√£o, Edgar P√™ra, Ant√≥nio de Macedo, Ant√≥nio- Pedro Vasconcelos and among several telefilms and a countless number of executive productions. The most recent films directed by Cunha Telles are Vidas (1984), Pandora (1996) and, more recently, Kiss Me (2004), the first and only cinematic experience of the top model Marisa Cruz.

His career spanned over a half-century, from 1929 to 1984. Biography Jorge Brum do Canto was born in Lisbon into a family with aristocratic Flemish and English roots. He attended high school and enrolled in the University of Lisbon School of Law, but did not finish his degree. Brum do Canto wrote about film; in 1925 he took his first acting role, a part in Rino Lupo's film O Desconhecido. From 1927 to 1929, Brum do Canto wrote for the newspaper O S√©culo. Meanwhile, he edited and/or collaborated on several cinema magazines flourishing at the time (Cin√©filo, Kino and Imagem). Interested in the French vanguard, he followed their lead as a director in his first film (A Dan√ßa dos Paroxismos), shot at the end of 1929. The film (produced by Mello, Castello Branco, Lda.) was first shown in November 1930; it was presented again on October 27, 1984 in the Cinemateca Portuguesa, which has its negatives and the only existing copies. Two years later he produced another film, Paisagem, but it was never completed for financial reasons. Until 1935 he shot more minor documentaries as an amateur, turning professional later that year when he assisted director Leit√£o de Barros on As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor. The following year, Brun do Canto was again assistant director on Chianca de Garcia's O Trevo de Quatro Folhas. In 1936‚Äì37, after several unsuccessful productions Brum do Canto directed his first feature film, A Can√ß√£o da Terra; it was well received at its premiere. Brum do Canto's career then became more prolific; by the early 1950s he had shot six more feature films. From 1953 to 1959 he interrupted his cinematic career and left his home in Lisbon, establishing himself on Porto Santo Island in Madeira (where he owned large properties) and dedicating himself to agriculture and sport fishing. Brum do Canto returned to cinema during the next decade with three films. In 1973, the Portuguese audience discovered him as an actor in theatrical plays broadcast by RTP. He acted successfully in Paddy Chayefsky's O Grande Neg√≥cio and Reginald Rose's Twelve Angry Men, both directed by Artur Ramos. Still acting, Brum do Canto returned to RTP in 1975 in the TV series Ang√∫stia para o Jantar directed by Jaime Silva.

The first appear in the fossil record in the Mississippian period and continue through to the Early Permian. The skull is small but very specialised, with large orbits, and large fenestrae. The primitive form Ophiderpeton has a pattern of dermal bones in the skull similar in respects to the temnospondyls. But in the advanced genus Phlegethontia the skull is very light and open, reduced to a series of struts supporting the braincase against the lower jaw, just as in snakes, and it is possible that the A√Østopods filled the same ecological niches in the Paleozoic that snakes do today. Pseudophlegethontia turnbullorum in the Field Museum of Natural History. They had an extremely elongated body, with up to 230 vertebrae. The vertebrae were holospondylous, having only a single ossification per segment. They lacked intercentra, even in the tail, and had are no free haemal arches. The neural arch was low and fused to the centrum. All of these features are very similar to those of the Nectridea, both representing the typical lepospondylous condition. A recent paper described the internal organization of the a√Østopod head, finding that a√Østopods retained many fish-like features of the skull and brain, including a persistent extension of the notochord into the head and an open canal between the pituitary gland and the mouth. Because these features are lost early in tetrapod evolution, this may be evidence that a√Østopods diverged from other tetrapods soon after the origin of digits. The ribs were slender, either single or double-headed, with the head shaped like a letter \\"K\\". There is no trace of limbs or even limb girdles in any known fossil, and the tail was short and primitive. Relationships Evolutionary relationships with other early tetrapods remain controversial, as even the earliest aistopod, the Vis√©an species Lethiscus stocki, was already highly specialised. A√Østopods have been variously grouped with other lepospondyls, or placed at or prior to the batrachomorph-reptiliomorph divide. However, a cladistic analysis by Pardo et al. (2017) recovered Aistopoda at the base of Tetrapoda.Jason D. Pardo, Matt Szostakiwskyj, Per E. Ahlberg & Jason S. Anderson (2017) Hidden morphological diversity among early tetrapods.

Generic He graduated in Anglo-American Studies at the Faculty of Arts of Lisbon University in 1976. He was active in the film club movement of the sixties, where he assimilated techniques and theories. In 1978, as a Gulbenkian Foundation scholarship winner, he finished his specialization in Film Studies at the Slade School of Fine Arts (London College University). He completed his Master of Arts in Media and Communication at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa (New University of Lisbon), with the thesis O Cinema Espect√°culo (The Film Show, 1985). He got a Phd in Film and History of the Media, with the thesis: Os Mundos do Cinema: Modelos Dram√°ticos e Narrativos no Per√≠odo Cl√°ssico (1997). He was a professor at the Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema in Lisbon (theatre and film school) from 1978 to 2004. He has been teaching at the Escola Superior de Comunica√ß√£o Social (media and communication college) since 2004. He is a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley (2007/2008). Between 1968 and 1976 he worked as a film critic for magazines and newspapers : Seara Nova, V√©rtice, Vida Mundial, A Capital, Rep√∫blica and Expresso. He was the author and presenter of the radio programme Moviola (1985/86), on Antena 1, dedicated to film sound-tracks. He made a TV show on cinema and culture. Between the end of the sixties and the beginning of the seventies, Geada gave an important contribution to film criticism, submitting his ideas on cinema to enlarged discussion, and publishing several books. From 1997 to 2002 he was the managing director to the CulturSintra Foundation (in Quinta da Regaleira, Sintra). Filmmaker He is a film and a TV director. His first film, Sofia ou a Educa√ß√£o Sexual (1973), was one of the last to be censored by the old regime and shown only after the Carnation Revolution. In the film take part some of the most important representatives of Portuguese culture, such as David Mour√£o-Ferreira, Jorge Peixinho, Eduardo Prado Coelho. As a b√©butant, Jo√£o Lopes, a future well-known film journalist and critic, worked in this film as assistant director. In spite of some problems with production, the film is finished. It raised expectations that would not entirely meet director's ambitions. After the revolution, Geada, a left-winged militant filmmaker among others, feels happy to be allowed to show his films uncensored in TV. He is free, like many others, to show things that had never been seen: the new Portuguese reality, focused by an optics very sensible to social justice and social progress, entering everybody's homes: Lisboa, o Direito √† Cidade, A Revolu√ß√£o est√° na Ordem do Dia, and Temos Festa are three films representative of the Portuguese movement of the cinema militante. One of his first films was O Funeral do Patr√£o (1975), based on a play by the Italian playwright Dario Fo. A Santa Alian√ßa (1977), based on a scenario by Geada himself, has the pamphlet-like structure of some other interesting post- Revolution films and was selected for the Quinzaine des Realisateurs, Cannes Film Festival. A most recent film, Passagem por Lisboa (1993), shows the memory of cinema: the film is dedicated to F√©lix Ribeiro and Lu√≠s de Pina, two pillars of the Portuguese Film Archive (Cinemateca Portugusesa). Mixing documentary and fiction, the film revisits Lisbon, at the beginning of the forties, with the participation of famous people, like Pola Negri, Leslie Howard, the Duke of Windsor, Primo di Rivera and the fictitious character Victor Laszlo (from Casablanca).

Biography In 1931, Guimar√£es studied painting in the School of Fine Arts in Oporto. Started to work in 1936 as a theater scenographer, illustrator and cartoonist. Film poster designer, became interested in cinematic art, and started to as assistant of directors as Manoel de Oliveira, Ant√≥nio Lopes Ribeiro, Jorge Brum do Canto, Arthur Duarte and Armando de Miranda. Directed, in 1949, the short documentary O Desterrado, a film about the life and craft of the Portuguese sculptor Soares dos Reis. Saltimbancos is his first feature-film, is an adaptation of the novel Circo (Circus) of the writer Le√£o Penedo, which is centered in the life of a small travelling circus. Meanwhile, Guimar√£es worked in advertising in Metro Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1952, Manuel Guimar√£es directed Nazar√©, which had the script wrote by the neo-realist writer Alves Redol, portraiting the life of the fishermen from Nazar√©. The film had several cuts caused by censorship. Vidas Sem Rumo (1956), script by Manuel Guimar√£es and dialogues by Alves Redol, suffered even worse cuts: about half of the film was cut and entire scenes were removed, becoming an almost unintelligible film. Being constantly attacked by the regime, Guimar√£es opted to direct more commercial movies about sport events, since 1956. In his attempt to return to fiction, (A Costureirinha da S√© ‚Äì 1958) Manuel had to accept product placement in the film. His next works were essentially documentaries promoting Portuguese towns and products. Ant√≥nio da Cunha Telles, who meanwhile began to produce the first films of the Portuguese Cinema Novo (New Cinema), became interested in him and accepted to do an executive production and co-production of two of his next films: O Crime da Aldeia Velha (1964), an adaptation of a Bernardo Santareno play and O trigo e o Joio (1965) based in the book with the same name, by Fernando Namora, who wrote the script as well. However, the public preferred a different kind of cinema, more entertaining, and Guimar√£es turn again to art documentary. Manuel Guimar√£es had some periods where he returned to illustration and graphic works in newspapers and other publications and continued painting, specially in the end of his life, but without any public expression. The 25 de Abril brought him hope, but it was too late. Ill, Manuel Guimar√£es couldn't end his last film, C√¢ntico Final, adapted from the novel with the same name wrote by Virg√≠lio Ferreira. The film was ended by his son, D√≥rdio Guimar√£es.

Life and career  Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro was born into a family with anti-clerical and anti-fascist ideals. His family moved to Lisbon when Monteiro was 15 years old to enable him to continue his studies. In 1963, with a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Monteiro traveled to Great Britain to study at the London Film School (known then as the London School of Film Technique). In 1965 in Portugal, he began work on his first film, Quem Espera por Sapatos de Defunto Morre Descal√ßo (Who Waits for the Deceased's Shoes Dies Barefoot), which would not be finished for five years due to financial problems. At the same time, he made the short documentary \\"Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen\\", about the Portuguese poet. Monteiro also wrote film criticism for periodicals like Imagem, Di√°rio de Lisboa and O S√©culo. His first feature film was Fragmentos de um Filme Esmola: A Sagrada Fam√≠lia (1972). In 1982 he made Silvestre an adaptation of traditional Portuguese folk stories. Silvestre was shown at the Venice Film Festival and was an important step in his international recognition. √Ä Flor do Mar (1986), featuring Laura Morante, was shown at the Salsomaggiore Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize. Monteiro returned to the Venice Film Festival in 1989 with Recorda√ß√µes da Casa Amarela (Silver Lion), a film that marked the introduction of the character Jo√£o de Deus. In 1992 he made O √öltimo Mergulho - esbo√ßo de filme, featuring Fabienne Babbe. A Com√©dia de Deus (Venice Film Festival, 1995), As Bodas de Deus (1999 Cannes Film Festival), Branca de Neve (Venice Film Festival, 2000) and Vai~E~Vem (Cannes Film Festival, 2003) were his last works. Branca de Neve (Snow White) was highly controversial because much of the film consists of a black screen, although a densely composed audio track plays throughout.  Aesthetics  One of the most controversial Portuguese filmmakers of his generation, Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro marked his presence in cinema with unclassifiable and polemic films made with idiosyncratic and somewhat experimental aesthetics, and influenced by his work as a film critic and a poet. In some of his last films, he played a recurrent protagonist, Jo√£o de Deus, a remarkably articulated and over-sexualized character whose customary attitudes involved spontaneous streaks of hedonism, scandal and satire. Although a substantial portion of his work was received with perplexity and outrage by the average movie-going audience, he has been recognized by Portuguese and international critics and academicians as one of the most important Portuguese directors, along with Manoel de Oliveira.

He pioneered the study of physiological optics at Dartmouth College, serving as a research professor, then as director of research at the Dartmouth Eye Institute. He conducted important research into aspects of binocular vision, including cyclophoria and aniseikonia. Ames is perhaps best known for constructing illusions of visual perception, most notably the Ames room and the Ames window. He was a leading light in the Transactionalist School of psychology and also made contributions to social psychology. Formative years Adelbert Ames Jr. was born in 1880 in Lowell, Massachusetts. His father, Adelbert Ames, was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War and Reconstruction Governor and Senator from Mississippi; his mother, Blanche Butler Ames, was the daughter of U.S. General Benjamin F. Butler, a controversial military leader, politician, and unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. presidency. Apart from his military and administrative service, General Ames obtained several U.S. patents for pencil sharpeners and other mechanical devices. Ames' sister Blanche Ames Ames was a woman's rights suffragist, and his brother Butler Ames was a politician and Army officer during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. His son, Adelbert Ames III (1921-2018), was the Charles Anthony Pappas Professor of Neuroscience, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In research papers, Adelbert Ames Jr. is commonly cited as Adelbert Ames II, to prevent his being confused with his father or his son. Ames attended Philips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, then went to Harvard College, where he earned a law degree, and where his most influential teachers were George Santayana and William James (whose daughter he was also engaged to, but did not marry). After practicing law for a few years, Ames abandoned it to become a painter. For several years, while collaborating with his sister, Blanche Ames (who was also a painter), the two of them tried to determine if the quality of visual art could be improved by the scientific study of vision. Ames set about improving his knowledge of the optical components of the eye, assuming that once he had mastered them, he would return to painting. As it was, his studies mastered him and Ames made vision his life's work. Ames went to Clark University in 1914 to study physiological optics, making enough of an impression to be made one of the eighteen founding members of the Optical Society of America in 1916. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, he served briefly as a captain in the aviation service, then as the overseer of a machine shop in which prototypes for instruments were developed. While in the army he continued his studies of optics, in part because one of the soldiers in that shop (with whom he became a friend and collaborator) was Charles Proctor, professor of physics at Dartmouth College. Dartmouth College After the war, Ames went to Dartmouth College in 1919 to work with Proctor. They decided to construct a large-scale model of the human eye using glass for its various layers, humors, and lens. In 1921, this work led to Ames' first published scientific paper, the award of an honorary Master of Arts degree, and his election as professor of research in a new department of Physiological Optics. In 1923, Ames began recruiting staff of what was to become the Dartmouth Eye Institute. From Eastman Kodak Company he recruited lens designer Gordon H. Gliddon. More staff joined the department over the years, including Kenneth N. Ogle, with whom Ames worked on stereopsis and binocular vision. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928. The Dartmouth Eye Institute (DEI) In 1935 the Department of Physiological Optics became the Dartmouth Eye Institute under the overall directorship of Alfred Bielschowsky, with Ames serving as its director of research. Ames garnered support for it from various sources including John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Rockefeller Foundation, and the American Optical Company. The institute at various times employed between thirty and forty staff, including researchers, and clinicians who examined patients' eyes and made eyeglasses. Research at the institute concentrated on binocular vision, including cyclophoria (the tendency of the eyes to rotate in opposite directions in their sockets) and aniseikonia (in which each eye has a differently sized retinal image of the same object). This latter defect could be corrected by lenses that restored the usual equality of image sizes. In 1940, Bielschowsky died unexpectedly. Hermann Burian, an ophthalmologist, worked briefly as acting director, and then was relieved by Walter Lancaster. He was not able to exert the influence he wanted, resigning in 1942. On 10 May 1947 the institute was closed. Scientific achievements and honors Ames is perhaps best known for his eponymous room, window, and chair. These were called \\"equivalent configurations\\" by Ittelson (1952), defined as \\"configurations [in which] identical 'incoming messages' can come from different external physical arrangements. In the absence of other information,... equivalent configurations will be perceived as identical, no matter how different they be physically\\" (p. 55). Ames also developed the concept of \\"transactional ambiguity\\" holding that \\"mental set\\" or expectation could materially affect one's perception of visual and other stimuli, as with the Ames trapezoid. This hypothesis extended the impact of mental set from the widely believed impact on one's conclusions about stimuli (the eye witness phenomenon) to actual perception of the stimuli itself. If true, it calls seriously into question the value of eye witness reports even by individuals with no prejudices about their observations. In 1941 Ames began to make notes in the morning on his transactional analysis of perception. In 1960 his collaborator Hadley Cantril published an edited selection from these notes, with a Preface, and included Ames' correspondence with John Dewey.Hadley Cantril editor (1960) The Morning Notes of Adelbert Ames, Rutgers University Press via Internet Archive In 1954, Ames was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Dartmouth. In 1955 he won the Tillyer Medal, awarded by the Optical Society of America. Ames died on July 3, 1955, and was buried at the Dartmouth Cemetery. His name, and that of his siblings, is also inscribed on the gravestone of his parents at the Hildreth family cemetery in Lowell. In the address given on the presentation of the Tillyer Medal, the president of the society listed 38 books and scientific papers Ames wrote, and 21 patents awarded to Ames.

The school is a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA),Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association: What is QGSSSA (accessed:16-08-2007) the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia (AGSA),The Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia: Member Schools (accessed:16-08-2007) the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA),Junior School Heads Association of Australia: JSHAA Queensland Directory of Members (accessed:16-08-2007) the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA),Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (accessed:16-08-2007) and the Australian Boarding Schools' Association.Australian Boarding Schools' Association: St Hilda's School (accessed:16-08-2007)  History  Goyte-Lea, Miss Davenport's Private School for Girls, 1905 St Hilda's School was founded in 1912, when the Diocese of Brisbane of the Anglican Church of Australia purchased an older school, Goyte-Lea, from Miss Davenport. Goyte-Lea was established prior to Australian federation in the late 19th century. The School was named after the seventh century Abbess of Whitby Saint Hilda. Saint Hilda was said to have turned serpents into stone, and three stone serpents are the emblem of the school's crest. The School's first Headmistress was Catherine Bourne, for whom a series of classrooms are named. The School's motto since establishment is Non nobis solum, Latin for \\"Not for Ourselves Alone\\". Pikedale Homestead (destroyed by fire in 1963) Although always a girls' school, St Hilda's does have 'old boys'. During the Second World War, secondary schools were used as army barracks. In March 1942, St Hilda's evacuated 90 boards to Pikedale homestead near Stanthorpe. The Anglican Church relocated boys from the Church of England Boys' School in Toowoomba, to St Hilda's in April 1942, while St Hildas was also used for a short time by the 135th Medical Regiment. The school returned from Pikedale to Southport in December 1943. From 2006 until 2016 Peter Crawley served as the first male principal of the school.Announcement from Chair of School Council .

The most well-known and well-studied species in the genus is Cryphonectria parasitica, the species which causes chestnut blight. The genus was, for a time, considered synonymous with Endothia, but the two are now recognised as distinct. Taxonomic studies in 2006 limited the genus to four species, but a fifth, Cryphonectria naterciae, was described in 2011 from Portugal.

By the 1940s it had killed most wild American chestnut trees, which were formerly one of the most abundant species in the eastern U.S. The infection takes place through bark wounds. In the early stage, clear yellow- brown spots appear on the young twigs; the bark then splits open, sinks in and dies out. In the next stage the cambium layer is infected, the tree trunk becomes disformed, the split bark parts start to swell as parasitic fungus produces more peridermia and yellow colored pycnidia start to appear on the bark. Then the tree's leaves wilt and branches start dying off. The release of fungal spores lasts through the whole vegetative season.

He was once the world's most expensive footballer, when he moved from Torino to Silvio Berlusconi's Milan for 18.5 billion Italian lire (¬£13 million) in 1992. Club career Born in Carmagnola, Piedmont, from Sicilian parents, Lentini grew up playing in the Torino youth system. After occasional appearances for the senior side, he spent the 1988‚Äì89 season on loan with Serie B club Ancona. He returned to a Torino team that had been relegated, but scored 6 goals as they won the Serie B title and were promoted straight back to Serie A for the 1990‚Äì91 season. Under the coach Emiliano Mondonico, he immediately won the Mitropa Cup in 1991, and he reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1992, also achieving a third-place finish in Serie A during 1991‚Äì92 season. His skill, talent, and notable performances with Torino attracted attention from larger clubs, as well as his first international call-up for Italy. He was eventually signed by A.C. Milan for a world record of ¬£13 million in 1992, and was a key part of their side during the 1992‚Äì93 season under manager Fabio Capello, scoring 7 goals in Serie A as they won the league title, two Italian Supercups in 1992 and 1993, and as they also reached the Champions League Final, only to be defeated by Marseille. A year after signing for Milan, at the age of 24, Lentini was involved in a serious car crash whilst driving home from a pre- season tournament in Genoa, in August 1993. He fractured his skull and damaged his eye socket and he spent about two days in a light coma. After the crash he never fully recovered his mercurial dribbling skills. Plagued by 'memory loss', periods of blurred vision, and 'dizzy spells' he was tormented by the spectre of what his career once was, when he returned to the pitch at the end of the 1993‚Äì94 season. His teammate at the time, Marcel Desailly, was compelled to confess that ‚ÄúYou could see the skills, how he was before the accident and after the accident, the balance was completely different‚Äù. His career in Milan fizzled out and culminated in a European Cup medal and another Serie A title that season, but this was merely for filling the bench; a paltry return for the world's most expensive signing at the time. The next two seasons would see him make few appearances, although he collected another Italian Supercup with the club, as well as a UEFA Super Cup, in 1994, also receiving runners-up medals in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup and the 1995 UEFA Champions League Final. During his final season with the club, he won a third Serie A medal. In 1996, he moved from Milan to Atalanta for a season, helping the club to a mid-table finish alongside Filippo Inzaghi, and he went on to play for six further clubs. He returned to Torino in 1997, spending three seasons with the club, and during the 1998‚Äì99 Serie B season, he helped his side to earn to promotion to Serie A the following season, where they once again would face relegation, before playing several seasons in the lower divisions with various other clubs. He subsequently played with Cosenza (2001‚Äì03), Cosenza F.C. (2003‚Äì04), Canelli (2004‚Äì08), Saviglianese (2008‚Äì09), and Nicese (2009‚Äì11), before ending his career with Carmagnola during the 2011‚Äì12 season, at the age of 43. International career Lentini initially made 2 appearances with the Italy national under-21 football team between 1987 and 1990, making his debut on 29 November 1989; he was a member of the squad that reached the semi-finals of the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, under manager Cesare Maldini, eventually finishing the tournament in third place. Whilst at Torino, he gained his first senior cap for the Italy national football team, in an international friendly in Terni against Belgium on 13 February 1991, which ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. He later become a regular member of Arrigo Sacchi's Italy side during the 1994 FIFA World Cup Qualifying campaign, although he would miss out on the final tournament due to his inconsistent performances following his serious car accident in August 1993. He was capped on 13 occasions in total, making his last appearance on 6 November 1996. Style of play During his prime, prior to his road accident in 1993, which later affected his career, Lentini was considered a highly talented prospect, and was known for his pace, mobility, work-rate, physical strength, intelligence, and leadership. Although he was usually deployed as a left winger, he was capable of playing on either flank. In particular, he was highly regarded for his creativity, his excellent technical ability, agility, speed, balance, and his dribbling skills, as well as his crossing ability, which made him an extremely effective attacking threat on the wing, and allowed him to beat opponents in one on one situations and subsequently provide assists for his teammates. Personal life Lentini was married to Alexandra Carlsson from Sweden and their son Nicholas was born in 1996. Nicholas is currently a goalkeeper.

The species in this genus are the most well-known of the parasitic catfishes also known as candiru, known for their alleged habit of entering the human urethra. Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Vandellia beccarii di Caporiacco, 1935 * Vandellia cirrhosa Valenciennes, 1846 (Candiru) * Vandellia sanguinea Eigenmann, 1917 Distribution V. beccarii originates from the Orinoco River basin and rivers of The Guianas. V. cirrhosa is distributed in the Amazon Basin. V. sanguinea inhabits the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo River basins. Description V. beccarii can be distinguished from other vandelliines by its square or slightly emarginate caudal fin and the colour pattern of two dark bands extending from the dorsal fin and the anal fin and converging onto the caudal fin. V. sanguinea may grow to 5.3 centimetres (2.1 in) SL. V. cirrhosa grows up to SL. Ecology These species are hematophagous (blood-consuming) parasites, like all other members of the subfamily Vandelliinae. V. cirrhosa uses visual and chemo-sensory orientation to find potential hosts. It is active both during the daytime and nighttime while foraging. V. cirrhosa enters the gill chambers of larger fish to suck blood. It bites mostly at the ventral or dorsal aorta arteries, and the blood is pumped into its gut by the host's blood pressure; it does not need any special sucking or pumping mechanism to quickly engorge itself with blood, but simply uses its needle-like teeth to make an incision in an artery. V. cirrhosa is able to engorge itself enormously; the ingested blood is visible through the swollen belly. Some kind of valve or sphincter is likely present to prevent reflux of ingested blood. The time required to engorge itself with blood and leave the host's gill chamber ranges from 30‚Äì145 seconds. Some host fish species (Colossoma macropomum) are able to hamper the attacks of V. cirrhosa by pressing the fish under the bony gill-cover flap, or by using its pectoral fin to press it against the flank or to sweep it from the gill-cover edge. V. cirrhosa is reputed to be able to enter the urethra of humans urinating under water; presumably it mistakes the urea for water exhausted from gills, however this has never been clinically proven. When inactive, V. cirrhosa burrows in sandy or soft, muddy bottoms. V. beccarii has been captured free-swimming.

The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The character Colonel Race is introduced in this novel. Anne Beddingfeld is on her own and ready for adventures when one comes her way. She sees a man die in a tube station and picks up a piece of paper dropped nearby. The message on the paper leads her to South Africa as she fits more pieces of the puzzle together about the death she witnessed. There is a murder in England the next day, and the murderer attempts to kill her on the ship en route to Cape Town. Reviews were mixed at publication, as some hoped for another book featuring Poirot, while others liked the writing style and were sure that readers would want to read to the end to learn who is the murderer. A later review liked the start of the novel, and felt that the end did not keep pace with the quality of the start, and the reviewer did not like when the story became like a thriller novel.

At Mill House, she finds a canister of undeveloped film and she learns that Kilmorden Castle is the name of a sailing ship. She books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler. In addition to his secretary, Guy Pagett, Pedler employs Harry Rayburn. Colonel Race recounts the story of the theft of a hundred thousand pounds' worth of diamonds some years before, attributed to the son of a South African gold magnate, John Eardsley, and his friend Harry Lucas. John and his friend were arrested and John's father, Sir Laurence, disowned his son. The war started a week later. John Eardsley was killed in the war and his father's huge fortune passed to his next of kin. Lucas was posted as \\"missing in action\\". The two men were not tried for the theft. Race reveals that he is the fortunate next of kin. Anne and Suzanne examine the piece of paper Anne obtained in the Underground station. The paper could refer to cabin 71, Suzanne's cabin, originally booked by a woman who did not appear. Anne connects finding the film roll in Mill House with a film canister containing uncut diamonds that was dropped into Suzanne's cabin in the early hours of the 22nd. They speculate that Harry Rayburn is the Man in the Brown Suit. Anne is attacked as she walks the deck of the ship; Harry Rayburn saves her. In Cape Town, Anne is lured to a house at Muizenberg, where she is imprisoned. Anne escapes the next morning and returns to Cape Town. There she finds that Harry is wanted as the Man in the Brown Suit and has gone missing. Pedler offers Anne the role of his secretary on his train trip to Rhodesia; she accepts at the last second, and is reunited on the train with Race, Suzanne, and Pedler, who has another new secretary named Miss Pettigrew. In Bulawayo, Anne receives a note from Harry which lures her out to a ravine near their hotel. She is chased and falls into the ravine. Almost a month later, Anne awakens in a hut on an island in the Zambezi with Harry Rayburn, who rescued her. Anne and Harry fall in love. Harry tells her his side of the story. Harry's island is attacked, but the two escape, and Anne returns to Pedler's party. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so that neither can be duped again. Reunited with Suzanne, Anne learns that the diamonds are with luggage sent on with Sir Eustace. She receives a telegram signed Harry telling her to meet him, but not using their code. Anne instead meets Chichester, alias Miss Pettigrew. She is led to Sir Eustace. Pedler forces Anne to write a note to Harry to lure him to his office. Harry turns up and Pedler is exultant until Anne pulls out a pistol and they capture Pedler. Race turns up with reinforcements and Pedler tries to bluff, but Race lists his crimes and the evidence. Sir Eustace escapes overnight. Anne is somewhat pleased, having a fondness for him. Race tells her that Harry is John Eardsley, not Harry Lucas, and the heir to a fortune he does not want. Harry has found his happiness with Anne, and they marry and live on the island in the Zambezi. Anne receives a letter from Sir Eustace, now living in South America.

Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement reviewed the novel in its issue of 25 September 1924. The review appreciated the \\"thriller-cum-adventure\\" style of the book and concluded, \\"The author sets so many questions to the reader in her story, questions which will almost certainly be answered wrongly, that no one is likely to nod over it, and even the most experienced reader of romances will fail to steer an unerring course and reach the harbour of solution through the quicksands and shoals of blood, diamonds, secret service, impersonation, kidnapping, and violence with which the mystery is guarded.\\" The unnamed reviewer in The Observer (7 September 1924) wrote: \\"Miss Christie has done one bold and one regrettable thing in this book. She has dispensed with Hercule Poirot, her own particular Sherlock Holmes, to whose presence and bonhomie and infallibility the success of her previous books has been mainly due.\\" After comparing Poirot with Harry Rayburn, the reviewer continued by saying that the book, \\"will be something of a disappointment to those who remember The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It is an excellent and ingenious complexity, in its way, but it might have been written by quite a number of the busy climbers of who now throng this particular slope of Parnassus. One almost suspects that Miss Christie contemplates exchanging the mantle of Conan Doyle for that of Miss Dell; a hazardous manoeuvre, for the two authoresses are very different in tastes and sympathies.\\" The reviewer went on to say that, \\"The plan of the book is rather confused. There is a prologue which does not link itself up with the rest of the story for quite a long time; and the idea of giving alternate passages from the diaries of the heroine and of Sir Eustace Pedler is not altogether justified by the glimpses it gives of that entertaining but disreputable character. One of the points on which some readers will have doubts is as to the plausibility of the villain: assuredly he is a novel type in that role. The book, like all Miss Christie's work, is written with spirit and humour.\\" Robert Barnard said about this novel that it was \\"Written during and about a trip to Southern Africa, this opens attractively with the heroine and her archeologist father (Agatha's interest in the subject was obviously pre-Max), and has some pleasant interludes with the diary of the baddie. But it degenerates into the usual stuff of her thrillers, and the plot would probably not bear close examination, if anyone were to take the trouble.\\" Some additional blurbs regarding the book, and used by The Bodley Head for advertising subsequent print runs, are as follows: :*\\"A capital tale ‚Äî mystery piled on mystery, incident on incident.\\" ‚Äî Referee. :*\\"Agatha Christie has written a most entertaining story, excellently conceived and executed.\\" ‚Äî Morning Post. Context in Christie works Like The Secret Adversary, The Man in the Brown Suit is less a novel of pure detection than it is a thriller typical of its period. It follows the adventures of Anne Beddingfeld who witnesses a man killed in a subway station and the man whose appearance frightened him, as she becomes involved in a world of diamond thieves, murderers, and political intrigue in this tale set in South Africa. Colonel Race makes his first appearance in the novel; he later appears in Cards on the Table, Sparkling Cyanide, and Death on the Nile. Development of the novel The book has some parallels to incidents and settings of a round-the-world work trip taken by Christie with her first husband Archie Christie and headed by his old teacher from Clifton College, Major E A Belcher, to promote the forthcoming 1924 British Empire Exhibition. The tour lasted from 20 January to 1 December 1922. It was on the tour that Christie wrote the short stories which would form all of Poirot Investigates (1924) and most of the contents of Poirot's Early Cases, published in 1974. Dining with the Christies before the trip, Belcher had suggested setting a mystery novel in his home, the Mill House at Dorney and naming the book The Mystery of the Mill House; and had insisted on being in it as well. He is the inspiration for the central character Sir Eustace Pedler, having been given a title at Archie's suggestion. The Mill House also makes an appearance, albeit located in Marlow. Christie found Belcher \\"childish, mean and somehow addictive as a personality: 'Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace', wrote Agatha of the fictionalised Belcher, a main character in The Man in the Brown Suit. 'I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it is.'\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations =Television= The Man in the Brown Suit (1989) aired in the US on 4 January 1989, adapted by Alan Shayne Productions in association with Warner Brothers Television. It is set in a later era than the 1920s and many details are changed as a result. At least one review found the story lacking, feeling that those adaptations of Christie's novels shown on PBS fared better than this one aired on CBS in the US.

It ran in fifty instalments from Thursday, 29 November 1923 to Monday, 28 January 1924. There were slight amendments to the text, either to make sense of the openings of an instalment (e.g. changing \\"She then...\\" to \\"Anne then...\\"), or omitting small sentences or words. The main change was in the chapter divisions. The published book has 36 chapters whereas the serialisation has only 28 chapters.Holdings at the British Library (Newspapers ‚Äì Colindale). Shelfmark: NPL LON LD23 In her 1977 Autobiography Christie made a slight mistake with the name of the serialisation and refers to it as Anna the Adventuress (possibly confusing it with the 1904 book of the same name by E. Phillips Oppenheim). Irrespective of this mistake, the change from her preferred title was not of her choosing and the newspaper's choice was one that she considered to be \\"as silly a title as I have ever heard\\". She raised no objections, however, as the Evening News were paying her ¬£500 (¬£ in current terms) for the serial rights which she and her family considered an enormous sum. At the suggestion of her first husband Archie, Christie used the money to purchase a grey, bottle-nosed Morris Cowley. She later stated that acquiring her own car ranked with dining at Buckingham Palace as one of the two most exciting incidents in her life. Christie was less pleased with the dustjacket of the book, complaining to the Bodley Head that the illustration, by an unnamed artist, looked as if the incident at the Tube Station occurred in \\"mediaeval times\\", when she wanted something \\"more clear, definite and modern\\". The Bodley Head were anxious to sign a new contract with Christie, now recognising her potential, but she wanted to move on, feeling that \\"they had not treated a young author fairly.\\" The US serialisation was in the Blue Book magazine in three instalments from September (Volume 39, Issue 5) to November 1924 (Volume 40, Issue 1) with each issue containing an uncredited illustration. =Book dedication= Christie's dedication in the book reads: \\"To E.A.B. In memory of a journey, some Lion stories and a request that I should some day write the Mystery of the Mill House\\". \\"E A B\\" refers to Major E A Belcher (see References to actual history, geography and current science above). =Dustjacket blurb= The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead both the front and back flap carried adverts for other Bodley Head novels.

Although it is commonly associated with monasticism, no major monastic order takes a vow of silence. Even the most fervently silent orders such as the Carthusians have time in their schedule for talking. Recently, the vow of silence has been embraced by some in secular society as means of protest or of deepening their spirituality. Silence is often seen as essential to deepening a relationship with God. It is also considered a virtue in some religions. In Western Christian traditions such as Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism, the Great Silence is the period of time beginning at the canonical hour of Compline, in which votarists are silent until the first office of the next day, Lauds. Examples Despite the common misconception, no major Christian monasteries or religious orders take such a vow. However, most monasteries have specific times (magnum silentium, work silence, times of prayer, etc.) and places (the chapel, the refectory, etc.) where speaking is prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Even outside of these times and places, useless and idle words are forbidden. In active orders the members speak according to the needs of their various duties.Catholic Encyclopedia In the Indian religions, religious silence is called Mauna and the name for a sage muni (see, for example Sakyamuni) literally means \\"silent one\\". In Buddhism, however, \\"one does not become a sage simply because of a vow of silence\\" due to the prescription for disciples to also teach the Buddhist doctrine. The vow of silence is also relevant in the training of novices and is often cited as a way to resist the allures of samsara, including those posed by the opposite sex. Buddhist monks who take a vow of silence often carry an iron staff called khakkhara, which makes a metallic noise to frighten away animals. Since they cannot speak, the rattle of the staff also announces their arrival when they start begging for alms. = Non-religious examples = Additionally, a vow of silence can be made to express a bold statement. This type may be to make a statement about issues such as child poverty. An example of this is The November 30th Vow of Silence for Free The Children in which students in Canada take a 24-hour vow of silence to speak up against poverty and child labour. In the United States, the Day of Silence is the GLSEN‚Äôs annual day of action to spread awareness about the effects of the bullying and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. Students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students. The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. From 2011 to 2017, the Day of Silence was held on the second Friday in April except for April 11, 2014; in 2018 it was observed on Friday, April 27. A more ancient example of a non-religious vow of silence is Pythagoras, who imposed a strict rule of silence on his disciples. =In pop culture= The 2006 film, Little Miss Sunshine, featured Dwayne, a Nietzsche-reading teenager, taking a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a test pilot. Garu, a character in the cartoon show, Pucca (TV series), was mentioned to have taken a vow of silence. The Poopsmith, a character in the long-running Web Series Homestar Runner, has taken a vow of silence, and has only had two speaking roles in the 19 years the series has been running. \\"The Cartoon\\", a season 9 episode of Seinfeld, featured Kramer taking a vow of silence due to his tendency to bluntly reveal things and not keep them to himself. The 2009 movie G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra featured Snake Eyes taking a vow of silence. The 2011 movie The Hangover: Part II featured a Buddhist monk taking a vow of silence as part of the film's plot. The 2017 television show The Good Place featured Jianyu, a Buddhist monk, taking a vow of silence. The HBO TV series Curb Your Enthusiasm (Season 8, Episode 5) featured a character taking a vow of silence. The episode title was also called \\"Vow of Silence\\". In the book The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle („Å≠„Åò„Åæ„ÅçÈ≥•„ÇØ„É≠„Éã„ÇØ„É´ Nejimakitori Kuronikuru), perhaps the character Cinnamon Akasaka has taken a vow of silence.

The species were unique marsupials, of the order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies), that had unusually thin legs yet were able to move rapidly. There are two recognised species of these marsupials, which inhabited dense vegetation on the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the genus was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct.  Taxonomy  The genus was proposed by William Ogilby in a presentation to the Linnean Society of London of a new species tentatively assigned to a genus of bandicoots, the long-nosed Perameles, and being forwarded to John Gould, then at Sydney, for a more detailed examination. Ogilby submitted a drawing by the collector Major Mitchell, who also supplied extensive remarks on the form and habits of the animal, and identified the unusual pig-like toes of the forelimbs as the basis for a new genus. The collection of the specimen was made at the interior of New South Wales by Mitchell, on the banks of the Murray River. The genus name Chaeropus combines terms derived from Ancient Greek for pig and foot, a reference to the unique characteristic of the forelimbs noted by the describing author. The specific epithet ecaudatus refers to the absence of a tail, which the single specimen happened to be missing, leading to the unfortunate suggestion by the name that the marsupial did not possess them. The recognised synonymy of the genus was published by Theodore S. Palmer in 1904. A nomenclatural synonym, Ch≈ìropus [Choeropus] Waterhouse, G.R. 1841, was published several years after Ogilby as an unjustified emendation; Waterhouse gives the spelling proposed by Ogilby in the same work. Oldfield Thomas noted the inappropriate epithet ecaudatus in 1888, substituting the name Ch≈ìropus castanotis proposed by John Edward Gray as the type of the genus, but this was suppressed as a synonym by Palmer. The vernacular description, pig-footed bandicoot, was given by Ogilby in his first description, a name ascribed by Mitchell's party. Europeans settlers reported the species as resembling \\"small antelopes\\", a simile that was reported by Bernard Woodward as persisting until their disappearance around 1900. The names recorded from the Noongar language are boda, woda, and boodal. According to Indigenous Australian trackers, the pig-footed bandicoot was known as \\"Landwang\\" and \\"Tubaija\\" in their culture. = Classification = This genus was previously placed in the family Peramelidae, along with the bilbies, as the subfamily Chaeropodinae by McKenna and Bell (1997). However, its form is quite distinct from the Peramelidae and bilbies, and recent molecular evidence supports this distinction. It is believed to be the sister group of the rest of the Peramelmorphia and has been assigned to its own family Chaeropodidae. The divergence of Chaeropus from other members of Peramelemorphia is estimated to be in the Mid-Late Oligocene, around 26.7 Ma (21.9‚Äì31.3 confidence interval). Until 2019, both species were grouped under C. ecaudatus as the pig-footed bandicoot; however, a 2019 study split the genus into two species: the northern pig-footed bandicoot (C. yirratji) and the southern pig-footed bandicoot (C. ecaudatus). In 2016, a fossil species C. baynesi was described from Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (2.47‚Äì2.92 Ma) of South-West New South Wales. The arrangement within the Marsupialia, with the treatment proposed in the 2019 revision, may be summarised as, * Peramelemorphia :*Thylacomyidae (Macrotis, the bilbies) :*Chaeropodidae ::*Chaeropus :::*Chaeropus ecaudatus ::::*Chaeropus ecaudatus ecaudatus ::::*Chaeropus ecaudatus occidentalis :::*Chaeropus yirratji :*Peramelidae (extant genera known as bandicoots) Description Taxidermied specimen at Melbourne Museum A genus of Peramelemorphia order of marsupials, allied by a monophyletic family, and regarded as exceptional in their morphology. The direct evidence of the two species is limited to twenty nine specimens remaining at museums in Australia and overseas. Their superficial appearance resembled the native bandicoots or kangaroo-rats, although very small and dainty, and comparable to the size of a young rabbit or kitten. The feet of forelimbs resemble those of the genus Sus and the hind legs seen as similar to a horse. The species had a body size of 23‚Äì26 cm and a 10‚Äì15 cm long tail. In form, they were almost bilby-like on first sight, having long, slender limbs, large, pointed ears, and a long tail. On closer examination, however, it became apparent that the pig-footed bandicoots were very unusual for marsupials. The forefeet had two functional toes with hooves, similar to the cloven hoof of a pig or deer; this is possibly due to juveniles being deposited in the pouch through external stalks, thus relieving them of using the forelimbs while as joeys. The hind feet had an enlarged fourth toe with a heavy claw shaped like a tiny horse's hoof, with the other toes being vestigial:only the fused second and third toes being useful, and that not for locomotion but for grooming. They had broad heads, and a long yet slender snout. Their fur was coarse and straight, but not spiny. In color they varied from grizzled grey through fawn to orange-brown, the belly and underparts were white with the fur on the ears being of chestnut color. The genus had five pairs of upper and three pairs of lower incisor teeth; the tooth shape differed between the two species. The females of the genus had eight nipples and the opening of the pouch was faced backwards, not forwards as is the case with kangaroos. Depictions of the species include a lithograph by Henry C. Richter in John Gould's Mammals of Australia, published in the mid nineteenth century. An unpublished illustration by Richter, under the direction of Gould, was discovered in the archives of Knowsley Hall, at one time home to a great patron of natural history, the Earl of Derby. The species C. ecaudatus was selected by Peter Schouten and Tim Flannery for a series of paintings that illustrated the known information on the species appearance and habits, published in a book surveying the modern extinctions of animals. Another reconstruction of the genus was produced by Schouten to illustrate the species C. yirratji. Distribution and habitat The two species were native to western New South Wales and Victoria, the southern part of the Northern Territory as well as South Australia and Western Australia. Chaeropus ecaudatus populated semi-arid southern regions of southern Australia, extending to southwest Australia, while C. yirratji populated sandy environments extending from Western Australia to the deserts in central Australia. They inhabited a wide range of habitat types: from grassy woodland and grassland plains to the spinifex country and arid flats of central Australia. Despite its wide range, the genus had a sparse distribution and was never abundant. The number of complete specimens that can be found in museum collections is twenty nine. Historical records of collections in central and western Australia, where it was sometimes locally common, begin with a specimen obtained at the Peron Peninsula during the Uranie expedition led by Louis de Freycinet in 1818. John Gilbert recorded his observations at dense stands of Casuarina seedlings (Allocasuarina species) at the interior of the southwest, beyond Northam, but did not appear in the Avon valley, inland from the new colony at Perth, at new settlements near Toodyay, York, and the Wongan Hills area. On his second collecting expedition in the southwest he recorded the species at King George Sound, on the southern coast of Western Australia. The species was not recorded in the lists produced by the Austin Expedition of 1854, although W. A. Sanford was informed of a frequently seen animal, described as the \\"chestnut-eared hog's-foot\\", which Ludwig Glauert suggests was too common to merit notice in Austin's published report. Despite actively searching and collecting information on this animal, the species was not recorded by John Tunney, George Masters or Guy Shortridge in their extensive surveys of western regions during the subsequent decades. The last record of Chaeropus in the Southwest Australian region was in 1898, at Youndegin, consistent with the disappearance of species in a critical weight range that succumbed to Australia's mammalian faunal collapse (1875‚Äì1925). Archaeological evidence of the genus shows a greater range during Holocene and the earlier Pleistocene epoch. Specimens were uncovered in the first examination of fossil deposits at Mammoth Cave (Western Australia), at the beginning of the twentieth century, and great extension of the known range to eastern Queensland at two sites examined a century later. The appearance in the fossil fauna of eastern Queensland sites demonstrates the replacement of rainforest communities with the open grassy habitat favoured by this genus during the later Pleistocene. A survey of mammal fauna in the northeast of South Australia uncovered a fragment in an owl pellet buried beneath sediments. The explorer Samuel Albert White was shown the tracks of the animal in 1921 and gained information on it habitat, being found on stony tablelands or at sand dunes in central Australia. and was able to capture one with the assistance of a local Aboriginal woman and her dogs. The increasing rarity of the animal saw it included on a list of prohibited exports, either live or skin, issued by the federal government in 1921. = Extinction = 1902 illustration According to Indigenous Australian oral tradition, pig-footed bandicoots were rare even before the arrival of Europeans on the continent and were in a serious decline even as it first came to scientific notice in the middle years of the 19th century. Two specimens of pig-footed bandicoot were obtained by local people in 1857 for Gerard Krefft, who accompanied the Blandowski Expedition. In trying to communicate the species he sought, Krefft showed a drawing to his collectors that showed the absence of a tail; the first specimens he was supplied were bandicoots with the tails removed. Despite the trouble taken in gaining living specimens, Krefft recorded his observations with an apology for eating one of them. Only a handful of specimens were collected through the second part of the 19th century, mostly from northwestern Victoria, but also from arid country in South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. By the start of the 20th century, they had become extinct in Victoria and the south-west of Western Australia. The last certain specimen was collected in 1901. By 1945, C. ecaudatus was extinct, having vanished from South Australia, and C. yirratji was reported to be limited to \\"a slight foothold in central Australia\\". Nevertheless, Aboriginal people report that C. yirratji survived as late as the 1950s in the Gibson Desert and the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia. The cause of the extinction remains uncertain: neither of the two most destructive introduced exterminator species, the fox and the rabbit, had yet arrived in south-west Western Australia when the pig-footed bandicoots disappeared from that area. Feral cats were already common, which may offer an explanation; it is perhaps more likely that the decline was caused by a double habitat change. Firstly, the end of many thousands of years of Aboriginal burning which, being confined to a patchwork of small areas at any one time, had ensured both fresh new growth in the recently burnt areas and adjacent older growth for shelter and as a base for recolonisation. However, Australia's Aboriginal population had declined by around 90% during the 19th century, largely because of the introduction of European diseases, and the remaining Aborigines were often no longer permitted to carry on their traditional land-management and hunting practices. Secondly, following on the heels of the near-extermination of the Aborigines, came the introduction of vast numbers of sheep and cattle, leading to significant changes in soil structure, plant growth, and food availability. The species was included in historical modelling of a disease outbreak, a theorised epizootic that was the primary cause of mammalian declines, to which the populations of Chaeropus would seem to have been highly susceptible. The sudden demise of these marsupials was noted by Hal Colebatch, writing in 1929 that the disappearance was not the result of direct actions of settlers but an unexplained consequence of a natural event. The apparent resilience of some mammals at Kellerberrin, who reappeared after a localised collapse, did not include this genus. When modelled as a primary factor in their demise, which has no discernible secondary factors, the population had no immunity to the hypothetical epizootic. An ethnographic survey of Aboriginal informants from central Australia in 1988 found the animal has not been seen in southern regions for around seventy years, but had persisted in the central desert regions. Behaviour and ecology  Mammals of Australia Few naturalist had the opportunity to observe and document the behaviour of the two species, one of the few existing accounts suggesting that it moved \\"like a broken-down hack in a canter, apparently dragging the hind quarters after it\\". This is contradicted by the Aboriginal people of central Australia, who knew it well and reported that if disturbed, it was capable of running with considerable speed by breaking into a smooth, galloping sprint. Chaeropus moved with a distinctive gait, exaggerated by their proportionally long and slender limbs that resemble a large grazing mammal like the African antelope. Each forelimb had two functional toes and the rear limb ending in a hoof like toe, with an apparent advantage when used to quickly evade a perceived threat. They were solitary, nocturnal animals that would sleep in their shelter during the day and emerge in the evening to feed, using its keen sense of smell to find food. Depending on the habitat, pig-footed bandicoots used a variety of shelters to hide from predators and for sleeping. John Gilbert found a nest site near Northam, Western Australia that he described as greatly resembling those made by quenda and marl, but with more leaves. In wooded areas and grasslands these ranged from hollow logs and nests made out of grass, while in arid treeless country this animal used to dig short, straight burrows with a nest at the end. From surviving eyewitness reports and analyses of gut contents, dentition, and gut structure of museum specimens, it appears that pig-footed bandicoots were the most herbivorous of the peramelemorphs; analysis based on dental morphology and tooth wear are consistent with a predominately plant- based diet. Captive specimens were fond of meat and Aborigines reported that they ate grasshoppers, ants and termites, the bulk of their diet was almost certainly leaves, roots and grasses. In captivity it was observed that they drank \\"a good deal of water\\". Tim Flannery suggests that breeding occurred between May and June and that twins may have been the norm for this species. From the size of its pouch and comparison with other marsupials of this size, it can be inferred that pig-footed bandicoots did not carry more than four young per litter. Correspondence to Ludwig Glauert, reporting its disappearance some decades earlier, suggested that the animal was extremely delicate and would die if caught and mishandled.

Summary Sergey Alexandrovich (), the narrator, is summoned from St. Petersburg to the estate of his uncle, Colonel Yegor Ilyich Rostanev (), and finds that a middle-aged charlatan named Foma Fomich Opiskin () has swindled the nobles around him into believing that he is virtuous despite behavior that is passive-aggressive, selfish, and spiteful. Foma obliges the servants to learn French, and gets furious when they are caught dancing the kamarinskaya. Uncle Yegor asks Sergey to marry the poor young girl Nastenka. It turns out Uncle Yegor is in love with her himself, but Foma wants him to marry the wealthy Tatyana Ivanova instead. Tatyana has several other suitors, including Mizinchikov, who confides in Sergey about his plans to elope with her. The next morning Tatyana has eloped, not with Mizinchikov but with Obnoskin, who acted under the influence of his mother. After a pursuit Tatyana returns voluntarily. At Stepanchikovo Foma Fomich is furious because Uncle Yegor has been caught red-handed during an assignation in the garden with Nastenka. Foma leaves, but falls into a ditch. The inhabitants beg him to come back. A general reconciliation follows after Foma, manipulating as ever, gives his blessing to a marriage between Uncle Yegor and Nastenka. Background The story has the structure of a comedy; it was originally intended as a play. Dostoevsky wrote this novel for Mikhail Katkov, main editor of The Russian Messenger. In a letter to his brother Mikhail, Dostoevsky wrote: \\"The long story that I am writing for Katkov displeases me very much and goes against the grain. But I have already written a great deal, it's impossible to throw it away in order to begin another, and I have to pay back a debt.\\"Joseph Frank, Dostoevsky. The Years of Ordeal 1850-1859, London, 1983, p. 263. In a later letter he sounded more optimistic: \\"I am convinced that there are many weak and bad things in my novel; but I am convinced - I stake my life on it! - that there are very fine things. They sprang from the heart. There are scenes of high comedy that Gogol would have signed without hesitation.\\" He submitted the novel to The Russian Messenger, but Katkov rejected it. Next he submitted it to The Contemporary, which accepted the novel, but at what Dostoevsky considered a humiliatingly low price. The editor of The Contemporary, Nekrasov, was very negative: \\"Dostoevsky is finished. He will no longer write anything important.\\"Joseph Frank, Dostoevsky. The Years of Ordeal 1850-1859, London, 1983, p. 264. The novel was ultimately published in Krayevsky's National Annals.A. V. Arkhipova. \\"Commentary\\" in F. M.

Edward Alexander Wadsworth (29 October 1889 ‚Äì 21 June 1949) was an English artist, most famous for his close association with Vorticism. He painted, often in tempera, coastal views, abstracts, portraits and still-life. He was also an engraver on wood and copper. In the First World War he was involved in transferring dazzle camouflage designs onto ships for the Royal Navy, and after the war he continued to paint nautical themes. Abstract Composition, 1915 Tate Gallery. Early life and study Wadsworth was born on 29 October 1889 in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, and was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh.Distinguished old Fettesians He studied engineering in Munich between 1906 and 1907, where he studied art in his spare time at the Knirr School. This provoked a change of course, as he attended Bradford School of Art before earning a scholarship to the Slade School of Art, London.Essay on Wadsworth, Richard Cork, Oxford Art Online His contemporaries at the school included Stanley Spencer, CRW Nevinson, Mark Gertler, Dora Carrington and David Bomberg. Career Wadsworth's work was included in Roger Fry's second Post-Impressionism Exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, 1912, in London, but he changed allegiance shortly after through friendship with Wyndham Lewis, and exhibited some futurist-derived paintings at the Futurist Exhibitions at the Dor√© Gallery. Although a member of the committee that organised a dinner in honour of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1913, he was one of a number of British painters in the nascent avant-garde that became increasingly disenchanted with the Italian's arrogance. By June of the following year, he was in a group of artists, including Lewis, who jeered Marinetti's public performance of The Battle Of Adrianople.Breaking The Rules, Bury, British Library, p112 He was a signatory of the Vorticist Manifesto published in BLAST the next month,Cooper, Philip. Cubism. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 104. and also supplied a review of Kandinsky's Concerning The Spiritual In Art and images to be reproduced in the magazine.Blast 1, Lewis et al., Bodley Head, 1914 First World War Dazzle- ships in Drydock at Liverpool, 1919, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Thirty three days after the Vorticist Manifesto was published, war was declared on Germany. Vorticism managed to continue into 1915, with a Vorticist Exhibition, June 1915 at the Dor√© Gallery and a second edition of BLAST published to coincide with the show. Wadsworth contributed to both, but signed up for the navy shortly after. His fellow vorticist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was killed at the front and Bomberg and Lewis found that their belief in the purity of the machine age was seriously challenged by the realities of the trenches. Wadsworth spent the war in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on the island of Mudros until invalided out in 1917, transferring dazzle camouflage designs onto allied ships.Modernist Art in Camouflage Known as Dazzle ships, these vessels were not camouflaged to become invisible, but instead used ideas derived from Vorticism and Cubism to confuse enemy U-boats trying to pinpoint the direction and speed of travel.Dazzle Painting Dazzle camouflage was invented and designed by Norman Wilkinson. Always a fan of modern ships, Wadsworth was to use nautical themes in his art for the rest of his career. The return to order Heralded by the major painting Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool, 1919, Wadsworth moved away from the avant-garde in the 1920s, and adopted a more realistic style. Wadsworth was a member of Unit One. Towards the end of his life his work became increasingly strange and surreal, although Wadsworth never had any formal links with the official Surrealist movement. Gravestone, Brompton Cemetery, London Later life Wadsworth died in 1949, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. Influences The graphic designer Peter Saville had seen Wadsworth's painting Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool and was struck by the image. After suggesting the idea and title to Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Saville carried the theme over to the sleeve design of their album Dazzle Ships (1983).

This fishery is highly regulated and restricted to fly fishing only. A daily permit is required to be purchased in addition to the Quebec provincial fishing license. All rules are strictly enforced to ensure the conservation and protection of this special salmon resource. Salmon permits can be obtained through the ZEC office in Matane. The river runs through a very scenic valley with a covered bridge, small farms and quaint villages on a section of Route 132. Petite Montagne pool in Matane. There are over 70 named salmon pools on the river, and it is very popular destination during the summer months. One of the most famous salmon wet flies invented here, and still used locally as well as throughout the Gaspe region, is the Tiger Ghost. The Matane Special, also originally tied by the legendary George Maul of the village of St. Rene du Matane, halfway up the river, is a popular dry fly fished here as well. Much of the upper river and the headwaters are included in a well-protected provincial reserve. The Matane River provides an important spawning habitat for Atlantic salmon.

He, unlike many of the others from the Vorticists, remained acquainted with Roger Fry.Roger Fry curated, in October 1917 Exhibition of Works Representative of the New Movement at the Art Mansard Gallery, and included a work by Etchells. In his architectural practice, Etchells produced some modernist buildings, the most well known of is his designs was for 232‚Äì4 High Holborn, London (1929‚Äì30) for the advertising firm WS Crawford Ltd., a commission he had obtained through his friend Ashley Havinden (1903‚Äì73) who was the company‚Äôs art director from 1929. This was the first fully modernist office building in central London. Its clean fa√ßade was matched by a modern interior, complete with built-in furniture and stainless steel. Etchells main responsibility was the fa√ßade.British Listed Building: 233, High Holborn, Camden Description: 233, High Holborn Grade: II Date Listed: 11 August 1971 English Heritage Building ID: 478249 Etchells's most significant work is his translation of Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture known in its English title as Towards a New Architecture: This has now been re-translated by John Goodman in his version Toward an Architecture 2007. Etchells later translated another book of Corbusier's Urbanisme, which in its English translation became The City of Tomorrow. He gradually moved into architecture after a period of book publication, with the Haslewood Press.Tucker, P (1990). Haslewood Books. The Books of Frederick Etchells & Hugh Macdonald. Oxford Hanborough Parrot. Later he became a church and conservation architect. He had close associations with John Betjeman who wrote his obituary. Betjeman was a tenant in one of Etchells's flats in Mayfair, this was during the period when Betjeman was a journalist with The Architectural Review. One of his restorations was St Andrew's Church, Plymouth; he also restored St George's Church, Donnington, West Sussex after a fire in 1939, and St James's Church, Abinger Common, Surrey in 1950 after bomb damage during World War II. He contributed articles to the journal The Studio., though often anonymously and to Artwork. He was an active member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) and a founding member of the Georgian Group. In the 1930s Etchells purchased a weekend cottage in West Challow then called Holme Lea, a Queen Anne property. He lived there between 1939 and 1944, having moved out of London. During that time he acquired and renovated a second smaller house in West Challow into which he, his wife and daughter moved in 1944.1939 Electoral Roll, Berkshire West Challow He was married to Hester Margaret Sainsbury who was a book illustrator, painter and artist known for her performances to music.

The extant eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is a medium sized parrot native to Oceania, particularly New Guinea and Australia. Males are mostly bright green, while females are a bright red. The male and female eclectus look so different from each other that they were thought to be different species for many years. Conservationally, they are of least concern. Eclectus parrots do well in captivity, and are a very popular pet across the world.  Description  Eclectus parrots generally have a big head and a short tail, and are striking in their coloration. They measure about 35‚Äì42 cm in length. They unusually exhibit reverse sexual dichromatism, a form of sexual dimorphism where the two sexes have differential coloration. Males are mostly green, with bright red underwings, blue primaries, and a yellow beak, while females are a striking red with a royal blue underbelly and black beak. Usually when birds exhibit sexual dimorphism, it comes with a sex role reversal, in which the males who usually gather food are left to incubate eggs, while the female forages. It is important to note that in the eclectus, no such sex role reversal occurs. The male still forages, while the female incubates the eggs. Research has shown this dimorphism with no role reversal is a product of the rare nest hollows, and the selective pressures that accompany this. It is thought that sexual selection has affected these birds in this way in order to provide camouflage for the male, while making the female a beacon, which is not what is usually seen in sexually dimorphic birds. Good nesting sites are rare to come by, so the female‚Äôs bright coloration alerts other males to females with hollows in the area, with whom they can then mate. It also serves as a signal to other females that the nesting site is occupied. The male is primarily responsible for obtaining food for the female and chicks, so his green coloration provides adequate camouflage from predators, such as peregrine falcons, while he is in the rainforest canopy in search of food. The male also has UV coloration in his feathers, which allows him to appear extra radiant to females, who are able to visualize the UV spectrum, yet remain camoflauged to predators who cannot. This unique coloration is evidence of an evolutionary compromise between the need to attract and compete for mates, and the risk of predation.  Taxonomy  Eclectus parrots are of the class Aves, order Psittaciformes, family Psittacidae, and genus Eclectus. The extinct oceanic eclectus parrot was of species Eclectus infectus, while the extant ecectus parrot is of species Eclectus roratus. The oceanic eclectus parrot is thought to be from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch, and was found in Vanuatu, Fiji, and on the Tonga Archipelago. It became extinct around 3000 years ago as a result of human settlement in these areas during that time. The genus was named by Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The epithet derives from eklektos, the ancient Greek cum Latin term for 'chosen one'; Wagler acknowledges the Latin in a publication later the same year. There are 9 subspecies of the extant eclectus roratus including the following: # Eclectus roratus aruensis: Aru Island eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus biaki: Biak Island eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus cornelia: Sumba Island eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus macgillivrayi: Australian eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus polychloros: New Guinea Red-sided eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus riedeli: Tanimbar Island eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus roratus: grand eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus solomonenisis: Solomon Islands eclectus parrot # Eclectus roratus vosmaeri: Vosmaer‚Äôs eclectus parrot Females of the Red-sided, Solomon Island, Australian, Aru Island, and Biaki eclectus all display a blue eye ring, blue breast, and do not have yellow in their plumage. The grand eclectus and Vosmaer‚Äôs eclectus both lack the blue eye ring, and have a purple breast. Both the Tanimbar Island and Sumba Island eclectus are completely red, but the Sumba Island eclectus is larger than the Tanimbar, while the Tanimbar has yellow on its tail. The Australian eclectus is the largest of all the subspecies, at 37 cm.  Habitat and Distribution  The eclectus parrot is endemic to rainforests from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, and the tip of the Cape York Peninsula of Australia. On the peninsula, they are restricted to rainforest patches in the Iron and McIllwraith ranges. Though geographically, the areas of Papua New Guinea and Australia where these parrots live seem relatively close together, these parrots do not fly enough to be able to cross the 70 miles between the peninsula and mainland Papua New Guinea. As such, it is thought that they expanded from Papua New Guinea into Australia around 10,000 years ago, when the two were connected by a land bridge. They prefer to stay in the canopy level of the rainforests, and can nest anywhere from 20 to 30 meters above the ground. Breeding hollows lower than this height tend to flood easily in the rainforest climate, and are generally avoided if possible.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = Eclectus parrots have a varied range of calls, from a loud, high-pitched squawk to whistles and screeches. They have also been observed to make a chime-like call when a male returns to the nest with food, in what seems to be a show of gratitude or an acknowledgement of return. = Diet = In the wild, eclectus parrots primarily feed on various fruits and their pulp. However, they will also feed on seeds, leaf buds, blossoms, nectar, figs, and nuts. They are frequently found to be eating the pulp of the fruit of Salacia chinensis (lolly berry) and Leea indica (bandicoot berry), and the seeds of Dodonea lanceolata. These items are of high nutritional value to the birds. These parrots eat intermittently, in order to increase food storage capacity and process means as quick and efficiently as possible. They have special adaptations in their digestive system to help them with this. Their esophagus is wide and flexible, to allow the fast passage of food and rapid digestion, and their proventriculus (glandular region between the crop and gizzard) is elongated and highly distensible, allowing it to hold comparable amounts of food as the crop. Ecelctus parrots can produce the fat they don‚Äôt get from their diet endogenously in their liver, from hexose sugars found in the fruit pulp they eat. After securing a good nesting hollow, females generally never leave the nest unless threatened, so the males are primarily responsible for feeding the female and her chicks. They have been observed to travel long distances in search of food, some over a 30 km2 range. The males usually feed the female in the mornings and the afternoons, and generally stick to a strict and regulated feeding schedule. = Reproduction = As stated previously, eclectus parrots nest in hollow cavities 20 to 30 meters above the ground. Optimal nesting hollows are relatively rare within the eclectus‚Äô habitat, and can be very difficult to find. As such, females tend to monopolize good nesting hollows once found, staying there up to 11 months a year, and returning to the same nest at times for multiple years. Females have been known to fight off other females, sometimes to the death, to defend their nesting hollows. Males have been known to travel unusually large distances to mate with females, the longest found being 7.2 kilometers (4.5 miles). Eclectus parrots are unusual among parrots because they exhibit both polyandrous mating (females mate with multiple males) and polygynandrous mating (males mate with multiple females and females mate with multiple males). Even more unusual, these birds exhibit a form of polyandry known as cooperative polyandry, in which multiple males breed with a single female, and all the males work together to help the female raise the chicks, rather than compete with each other. They are the only parrot known to do this. Females will lay 2 eggs per clutch, but often only fledge 1 young. Eclectus are also unusual in that they can bias the sex of their offspring, such that they can manipulate whether their offspring are male or female. It is thought that this behavior occurs as a result of the scarcity of their nesting hollows. As such, females will only have male offspring when resources are plentiful, a good nesting hollow is secured, and many males are around to feed her and her offspring, as male offspring are more energetically expensive to raise as compared to females.

Dismorr participated in almost all of the avant-garde groups active in London between 1912 and 1937 and was one of the few English painters of the 1930s to work in a completely abstract manner. She was one of only two women members of the Vorticist movement and also exhibited with the Allied Artists Association, the Seven and Five Society and the London Group. She was the only female contributor to Group X and displayed abstract works at the 1937 Artists' International Association exhibition. Poems and illustrations by Dismorr appeared in several avant-garde publications including Blast, Rhythm and an edition of Axis. Early life Dismorr was born at Gravesend in Kent, the fourth of five daughters born to Mary Ann Dismorr, n√©e Clowes, and John Stewart Dismorr, a rich businessman with property interests in South Africa, Canada and Australia. The family moved to Hampstead in the 1890s, where Jessica Dismorr was educated at Kingsley College and where she became head girl. Her mother suffered from extended periods of ill health but her father's income meant the family were free of financial worries and Jessica was able to travel extensively in Europe. Dismorr attended the Slade School of Art from 1902 to 1903, before training under Max Bohm at Etaples in 1904, and at the Acad√©mie de La Palette in Paris, between 1910 and 1913, where she studied under Jean Metzinger and was in the circle around the Scottish Colourist, John Duncan Fergusson. In Paris, Dismorr shared a studio with the American artist Marguerite Thompson. In 1911, Dismorr contributed several illustrations to the avant-garde Rhythm magazine. During July 1912 she showed three landscapes, to favourable reviews, with the Allied Artists Association. Dismorr exhibited with Fergusson and S. J. Peploe in October 1912 at the Stafford Gallery in London. From 1912 to 1914 Dismorr also exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. In 1912 and 1913, Dismorr exhibited Fauvist influenced work with the Allied Artist's Association. The Fauvist influence is said to have resulted from her studies at the Acad√©mie de La Palette. Vorticism Dismorr met Wyndham Lewis in 1913 and by 1914 had become a member of the Rebel Art Centre. She maintained a studio in the Kings Road, Chelsea, London, as well as taking frequent trips to France. Dismorr was a signatory to the Vorticist manifesto published in the first issue of their literary magazine, Blast in 1914, and also contributed illustrations and a written piece, Monologue, to the second issue in 1915. She shared the group's depiction of the dynamics of the machine and their desire to challenge the public's conservative views on art but little of her work from this period survives. The four works she contributed to the Vorticist exhibition in 1915 are now thought to be lost, as is the original of The Engine which was reproduced in an edition of Blast. Both the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate hold one example each of Dismorr's work from this period and the collector John Quinn displayed several examples in New York in December 1916. Dismorr exhibited with the Vorticists again in New York in January 1917 at the Penguin Club. Abstract composition ca. 1915 Apart from Dismorr, the only other female member of the Vorticist group was Helen Saunders. William Roberts's painting The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915, from 1961‚Äì62, shows the seven males dominating the foreground and the two women behind with Dismorr in the doorway being the furthest away. According to Kate Lechmere, the financial backer of Blast and the Rebel Art Centre, Dismorr had a difficult relationship with Wyndham Lewis, and was, along with fellow artist Helen Saunders, one of the \\"little lapdogs who wanted to be Lewis‚Äôs slaves and do everything for him\\". Lechmere claimed that on one occasion Dismorr stripped naked in Oxford Street to demonstrate she would do anything Lewis asked of her. Dismorr and Wyndham Lewis fell out in 1925 when she refused to purchase some drawings from him when he was short of money but they appeared to have resumed a cordial friendship in 1928 when she did lend him some funds. Robin Ody, a close friend and the executor of Dismorr's will (in which all the beneficiaries were women), summed her up as \\"the Edwardian phenomenon of the new woman\\". Ody considered that she did not have a physical relationship with Lewis. Lechmere's relationship with Lewis ended bitterly, and she carried out a legal struggle to recover money owed her by him. Lechmere had provided all the funds to pay for the Rebel Art Centre, where the Vorticists first met in 1914--a fact which Lewis had to admit to Christopher Nevinson who had not wanted \\"any of these damned women\\" in the group. World War I During World War I Dismorr served as a nurse in France and then as a bilingual field officer with the American Friends Service Committee. After the war Dismorr was at the centre of the London avant-garde world, acquainted with both T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, with her poems and illustrations being published in various publications. During 1919 several poems by Dismorr were published in The Little Review but following a highly critical article by A.Y. Winters she did not submit any more for publication until the 1930s. Early in 1920 Dismorr had a handful of paintings shown, in group shows, at both the Mansard Gallery and the New Art Salon. From 1920 until 1924 she appears to have had no settled home and travelled throughout Europe, spending time in Paris, the Alpes-Maritimes and in both London and Folkestone. She had a nervous breakdown in 1920 and received medical advice not to paint. Lewis suspected that it was her modern style that was causing the doctors concern, and wrote to her that \\"the best possible distraction for you would be to paint\\". Later life In 1924 Dismorr began a series of water colour paintings of music hall performers, a popular subject at the time. In 1925 her first solo exhibition was held at the Mayor Gallery in London. R. H. Wilenski wrote the introduction to the exhibition cataloue. The exhibition included a series of water colours painted in France, Italy, Spain, Scotland and England. A Fauve type composition, Pyrenean Town, was reproduced in reviews of the show and also shown at the Seven and Five Society. Caring for her ill mother left Dismorr little time to paint and throughout 1926 she mostly showed previously displayed works. Both her mother and sister Blanche died in 1926 and Dismorr herself was ill during 1927. Dismorr recovered and between 1927 and 1934 exhibited some twenty-six figurative pieces with the London Group. In the early 1930s these included a series of portraits of poets, including Dylan Thomas, Cecil Day Lewis and William Empson. She exhibited with Charles Ginner and Barbara Hepworth in the London Group, as well as with Ivon Hitchens and Ben Nicholson in the Seven and Five Society, having joined both groups in 1926. Dismorr showed with the anti-fascist Artists' International Association in the early 1930s. She produced several pointillist self-portraits alongside portraits of her mother and female friends. One of these was of the artist Catherine Dawson Giles, whom Dismorr had known since 1904 when they met in Etaples. The two had also travelled together on painting expeditions in Europe in the 1920s. For several years Dismorr had lived at the Giles family home in London. Throughout her final years, Dismorr continued painting and exhibiting her work, which became completely abstract during the late 1930s. She exhibited with the Association Abstraction-Creation. She contributed her work, \\"Related Forms\\" to Axis magazine in 1937 (no 8: 25). Dismorr committed suicide by hanging in London on 29 August 1939, five days before Britain declared war on Germany.  Later Exhibitions and Research  A joint exhibition of works by Dismorr and Giles was held in 2000 at the Fine Art Society in London, with a catalogue written by Quentin Stevenson. Pallant House Gallery held an exhibition of the works of Dismorr and her contemporaries in early 2020. The exhibition was curated by the Gallery in partnership with Dr Alicia Foster. Catherine Heathcock's (unpublished) PhD thesis contains a complete catalogue of Dismorr's works. The letters between Dismorr and Lewis are now held at Cornell University.

She and Jessica Dismorr were the only female members. Saunders was fluent in both French and German and during World War I worked in the office of the United Kingdom Government Censor. Saunders exhibited with the London Group in 1916, but from 1920 she increasingly turned away from the avant-garde and adopted a more realist style, working in still life, landscapes and portraiture, and latterly exhibiting with the Holborn Art Society.

The species are primarily African, with some species occurring in India, Sri Lanka, and China. The origin of S. indicum is uncertain, as it is widely cultivated and naturalized in tropical regions. The genus is closely related to the strictly African genus Ceratotheca and is itself probably African in origin.

Nitrilases are involved in natural product biosynthesis and post translational modifications in plants, animals, fungi and certain prokaryotes. Nitrilases can also be used as catalysts in preparative organic chemistry. Among others, nitrilases have been used for the resolution of racemic mixtures. Nitrilase should not be confused with nitrile hydratase (nitrile hydro-lyase; ) which hydrolyses nitriles to amides. Nitrile hydratases are almost invariably co-expressed with an amidase, which converts the amide to the carboxylic acid. Consequently, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish nitrilase activity from nitrile hydratase plus amidase activity.  Mechanism  Nitrilase was first discovered in the early 1960s for its ability to catalyze the hydration of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Although it was known at the time that nitrilase could operate with wide substrate specificity in producing the corresponding acid, later studies reported the first NHase (nitrile hydratase) activity exhibited by nitrilase. That is, amide compounds could also be formed via nitrile hydrolysis. Further research has revealed several conditions that promote amide formation, which are outlined below. * Early release of the enzyme-bound substrate after the first water hydrolysis followed by delayed addition of the second water * Low temperature and increased pH conditions. For bioconversions by nitrilase for most bacteria and fungi, the optimal pH range is between 7.0-8.0 and the optimal temperature range is between 30-50‚ÑÉ. * Electron withdrawing groups at the ‚ç∫-position thumbleft The conversion of a general nitrile to either an amide or carboxylic acid is facilitated by nitrilase. 324x324px Below is a list of steps involved in transforming a generic nitrile compound with nitrilase: # The electrophilic carbon of the nitrile is subject to nucleophilic attack by one of the two SH groups on nitrilase. # The thioimidate formed is subsequently hydrolyzed to the acylenzyme and ammonia is created as a byproduct. # The acylenzyme can undergo one of two pathways depending on the conditions highlighted above: #* Further hydrolyzation of the acylenzyme with water produces the carboxylic acid and the regenerated enzyme. #* The acylenzyme is hydrolyzed by ammonia, displacing the enzyme and forming the amide product.  Structure  The active site of a thermoactive nitrilase from Pyrococcus abyssi, detailing the Lys-Cys-Glu catalytic triad responsible for cleaving C-N bonds. Unfortunately, attempts to crystallize the enzyme with either fumaro- or malononitrile have been ineffective so the binding motif remains unknown. Most nitrilases are made up of a single polypeptide ranging from 32-45 kDa, and its structure is an ‚ç∫-Œ≤-Œ≤-‚ç∫ fold. The favored form of the enzyme is a large filament consisting of 6-26 subunits. Nitrilase exploits the lys-cys-glu catalytic triad which is essential for its active site function and enhancing its performance. The structure of a thermoactive nitrilase from P. abyssi consists of a 2-fold symmetric dimer in which each subunit contains 262 residues. Similar to other nitrilases in the nitrilase family, each subunit has an ‚ç∫-Œ≤-Œ≤-‚ç∫ sandwich fold; when the two subunits come together and interact, the protein forms a ‚Äòsuper-sandwich‚Äô (‚ç∫-Œ≤-Œ≤-‚ç∫-‚ç∫-Œ≤-Œ≤-‚ç∫) structure. In order to dimerize, the C-terminals of each subunit extend out from the core and interact with each other, and this is largely made possible by the salt bridges formed between arginine and glutamate residues. Although the exact binding mechanism to the nitrile substrate still remains unknown, by drawing comparisons between the sequence and structure with other nitrilases, the catalytic triad was determined to consist of Glu 42, Lys 113, and Cys 146. With the aid of protein modeling programs, Glu 42 was observed to be the catalytic base in activating the nucleophile (Cys 146) based on the relatively short distance between the O in Glu and S in Cys. Likewise, Lys 113 was inferred to be the catalytic acid responsible for proton transfer to the substrate.  Biological Function  Nitrilases have critical roles in plant- microbe interactions for defense, detoxification, nitrogen utilization, and plant hormone synthesis. In plants, there are two distinguishable groups in regard to substrate specificity: those with high hydrolytic activity towards arylacetonitriles and those with high activity towards Œ≤-cyano-L-alanine. NIT1, 2, and 3 of the A. thaliana species are examples of the first group of plant nitrilases (arylacetonitrilases) which hydrolyze the nitriles produced during the synthesis or degradation of cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. The arylcetonitrile substrates for these particular enzymes consist of phenylpropionitrile and other products that result from glucosinolate metabolism. NIT4 however, belongs to the second group of plant nitrilases and is critical for cyanide detoxification in plants. Moreover, microbes could also potentially utilize nitrilase for detoxifying and assimilating nitriles and cyanide that exist in the plant environment. An example of this is the Œ≤-cyano-L-alanine nitrilase by the plant bacterium P. fluorescens SBW25. Although it is unknown whether this plant bacterium encounters toxic levels of Œ≤-cyano- ü-alanine in natural settings, nitrilase activity has been observed in cyanogenic plants; thus, it seems that the nitrilase serves as a predominant mechanism for detoxifying cyanide instead of Œ≤-cyano- ü-alanine. Other bacterial applications of nitrilases produced by plant-associated microorganisms include the degradation of plant nitriles for a carbon and nitrogen source. P. fluorescens EBC191 hydrolyzes many arylacetonitriles, namely mandelonitrile, which serves as a defense against herbivores.

It was probably influenced through folk etymology by the Latin nare and natare meaning \\"swim\\"; it appears to be a grammatically feminine word for \\"swimmer\\". Geography The refuge of a widely distributed Western European lineage regarding the barred grass snake commonly known as Natrix helvetica was most likely located in southern France and outside the classical refuges in the southern European peninsulas.

If this occurs frequently or repeatedly over an extended period of time, a large number of handles may be marked in-use and thus unavailable, causing performance problems or a crash. The term is derived from memory leak. Handle leaks, like memory leaks, are specific instances of resource leaks. Causes One cause of a handle leak is when a programmer mistakenly believes that retrieving a handle to an entity is simply obtaining an unmanaged reference, without understanding that a count, a copy, or other operation is actually being performed. Another occurs because of poor exception handling design patterns when programmers do not consider that when an exception occurs and a sub routine is exited prematurely, the cleanup code at the end of the routine may not be executed. An example of this might be retrieving a handle to the display device. Programmers might use this handle to check some property (e.g. querying the supported resolutions), and then simply proceed on without ever releasing the handle. If the handle was just a pointer to some data structure with no additional management, then allowing the handle to pass out of scope would not cause an issue. However, in many cases, such handles must be explicitly closed or released to avoid leaking resources associated with them; the exact requirements for what must be done with a handle varies by interface.

Forerunners to the Tripartite Convention of 1899 were the Washington Conference of 1887, the Treaty of Berlin of 1889, and the Anglo-German Agreement on Samoa of 1899. Politics prior to the convention By the 1870s modern economic conditions were well established and accepted by the Samoans, who had just enough of a government that could be manipulated at will by the foreign business interests in Samoa. After the United States concluded a friendship treaty with Samoa in 1878, Germany negotiated her own Favorite Nation Treaty in 1879 with the same Samoan faction as the U.S., while later in 1879 the Anglo-Samoan treaty was completed with a rival faction. Contentions among the whites in Samoa, plus native factional strife led to side-choosing that became deadly warring with the introduction of modern weapons. =Washington conference of 1887= To attempt to resolve some of the problems, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom agreed to a conference at Washington in June 1887. After the surfacing of serious disagreements among the parties, the conference adjourned without results. Fighting by nationals of the three powers with their factional local allies led to a conflict that was only tempered by the Apia hurricane of 1889 that wrecked warships on the verge of hostilities. =Treaty of Berlin of 1889= The seriousness of the situation was finally recognized and German foreign minister Count Herbert von Bismarck (chancellor Otto von Bismarck's son) proposed to reconvene the adjourned Washington conference of 1887.Gray, Amerika Samoa, p. 86 He invited U.S. and British representatives to Berlin in April 1889.Ryden, The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa, p. 455; in deference to the American delegation who had few German or French speakers (French was then the language of international diplomacy), Count Bismarck agreed to conduct the proceedings in English Bismarck's pragmatic approach proposed protection for life, property, and commerce of the treaty participants and relegated native government and their unstable \\"kings\\" to the Samoans, with which the British concurred. The United States insisted on a three-powers authority, while preserving native rights. In the Treaty of Berlin of 1889 thus a joint protectorate or condominium was declared, with a European/American chief justice, a municipal council for Apia, and with the \\"free right of the natives to elect their Chief or King\\" as the signatory to the act, thus the treaty professed to recognize a Samoan independent government.Gilson, Samoa 1830-1900, p. 396 No sooner was the native royal- figurehead appointed (and, after disturbances, restored),than the other chiefs went into rebellion, and civil war ensued. By the end of the 19th century, the failure of the arrangement was freely admitted by the governments of the three powers, since the principal protagonists in Samoa acted directly for their own respective interests, frequently overruling the officials of the condominium. A dissolution of the condominium, created by the \\"entangling alliance\\", was now in play. The Tripartite Convention of 1899 Samoan Archipelago (1900‚Äì1914) The German government \\"had never made a secret of their belief that international control of Samoa was visionary and impractical ... and they began a series of diplomatic moves intended to eliminate it altogether.\\"Gray, p. 100 German diplomats in Washington had ascertained during the summer of 1899 that the United States administration was satisfied with obtaining the island of Tutuila with its key asset, the existing coaling station at Pago Pago. With \\"partitioning of Samoa\\" by then the prevailing understanding, the United States expressed no objections to Britain and Germany \\"coming to a preliminary agreement.\\"The United Kingdom was then embroiled in the Second Boer War and therefore viewed as in a weakened bargaining position [Coates, Western Pacific Islands, p. 230], however, the German desire to rapidly conclude the negotiations and bring the western Samoan islands into their colonial empire, had a balancing effect that was clearly evidenced in the agreement as signed. Kaiser Wilhelm II had accepted an invitation to visit England in November 1899 and his government insisted that an agreement on Samoa should be concluded before his departure for Britain.Gilson, p. 432 A settlement was reached at London by 9 November and signed on 14 November.The United States Department of State was informed on 9 November 1899 through the U.S. embassy at Berlin that foreign minister Count Bernhard von B√ºlow expressed the hope to the U.S. charg√© daffaires that the Anglo-German \\"agreement would meet with the satisfaction of the United States,\\" since according to the agreement, \\"... not only Tutuila would become the property of the United States, but also the smaller islands\\" of the Manua group [Ryden, p. 571]. It was therefore this Anglo-German agreement on Samoa in tandem with the informal understanding with the United States that partitioned Samoa. It only remained for the three powers to negotiate a tripartite convention in order to secure the approval of the United States to the whole agreement.Ryden, p. 572 The Tripartite Convention of 1899 was duly constituted and documents were signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 by the U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, Baron Theodor von Holleben, German ambassador to the United States, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, British ambassador to the United States, with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900.Ryden, p. 574 #Positions as a result of the Tripartite Convention of 1899  Positions resulting from the Tripartite Convention of 1899  United States: Seal of American Samoa :President William McKinley signed an executive order on 19 February 1900, reading: \\"The Island of Tutuila, of the Samoan Group, and all other islands of the group east of longitude 171 degrees west of Greenwich, are hereby placed under the control of the Department of the Navy for a naval station. The Secretary of the Navy shall take such steps as are necessary to establish the authority of the United States and to give to the islands the necessary protection.\\" On the same day John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy, stated further that these islands \\"... are hereby established into a naval station, to be known as the naval station, Tutuila, and to be under the command of a commandant.\\" Rose Island, an uninhabited coral atoll, and the island of Aunu'u were included. The cession of deeds of the islands of the Manua Group (Ta'u and Ofu-Olosega) did not take place until 1904, although the respective chiefs had previously accepted the sovereignty of the United States.Ryden, p. 575-576 The term \\"American Samoa\\" entered into conscious usage in 1905 with a first assembly, or fono, of the Samoan chiefs on all ceded islands within the naval station.Gray, p. 160Beginning with the American-Samoan Friendship treaty of 1878, and continuing through the Washington Conference of 1887, the Berlin Conference (in 1889), and to the Tripartite Convention of 1899, the United States held a consistent position ((not always publicly), to acquire the coaling station at Pago Pago Bay. It was the probability of building a canal in Central America (eventually to be controlled by the U.S. and realized as the Panama Canal) that defined this American perspective.Swains Island, a privately-owned atoll in the Tokelau group, became officially part of American Samoa by annexation on 4 March 1925. Coat of Arms of German Samoa German Empire: :The Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii and the small islands of Apolima and Manono, west of 171 degrees west longitude, were declared a protectorate of the German Empire, and became known as German Samoa, with a flag-raising on 1 March 1900, and appointment of Wilhelm Solf as governor. This \\"happy acquisition\\" was viewed in Germany as a \\"splendid achievement in colonial policy, which is at the same time a genuinely popular one.\\" United Kingdom:Referred to as, 'Britain' or 'Great Britain', when mentioned in direct quotes :By surrendering all rights in Samoa, the United Kingdom \\"obtained extensive compensation from Germany elsewhere\\",Ryden, p. 571 in effect, \\"transfer of all of the German rights in the Tonga group including‚Äù * ‚Äúthat of establishing a naval and coaling station,‚Äù * ‚Äúand the right of extraterritoriality;‚Äù * ‚Äúthe shifting of the line of demarcation between German and British islands in the Solomon group so as to give to Great Britain all the German islands to the east and southeast of the island of Bougainville;‚Äù * ‚Äúthe division of the so-called neutral zone in West Africa by a definite boundary line between British and German possessions;‚Äù * ‚Äúthe promise of Germany to take into consideration, as much and as far as possible, the wishes which the Government of Great Britain may express with regard to the development of reciprocal tariffs in the territories of‚Äù ** ‚ÄúTogo and‚Äù ** ‚Äúthe Gold Coast;‚Äù * ‚Äúthe renouncing by Germany of her rights of extraterritoriality in Zanzibar.\\" These treaty arrangements of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 stayed in place until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

They are small, basically dull green parrots differentiated by patches of other colours, and are commonly known as grass parrots. The genus has some sexual dichromatism, with males having brighter hues. Taxonomy Sometimes the broad-tailed parrots are considered a subfamily. In this case, Neophema and Bourke's parrot are united in the tribe Neophemini. mtDNA sequence data (Miyaki et al. 1998) suggests that the former may be correct, but the latter almost certainly is not. Rather, it appears, the group would need to include more closely related forms, such as the budgerigar and the Pezoporus ground- parrots. However, while Joseph et al. (2011) also found Neophema to be related both Bourke's parrot and ground-parrots and form part of the tribe Pezoporini, they are not related to the budgerigar. =Species= There are 6 or 7 species: * Blue-winged parrot, Neophema chrysostoma * Elegant parrot, Neophema elegans * Rock parrot, Neophema petrophila * Orange-bellied parrot, Neophema chrysogaster * Turquoise parrot, Neophema pulchella * Scarlet-chested parrot, Neophema splendida Depending on the author, Neopsephotus bourkii (Bourke's parrot) may also be considered a member of this genus. Aviculture The scarlet-chested parrot, turquoise parrot and elegant parrot are all commonly raised and bred in captivity with a number of unusual colour forms arising. The members of this genus are not altogether easy to keep, being tender birds that may die without apparent cause, succumbing to mobbing by more robust aviary mates or diseases. This has hampered captive propagation efforts, e.g. in the case of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. They are certainly not \\"beginner's birds\\" and will usually not thrive if they are not provided with a spacious aviary where a small flock can be kept in company of a few other small and harmless birds. It is possible to keep a pair or a single bird in a cage, but they will be sluggish and unhealthy if they are not let out to fly and socialize with humans frequently. Trade in wild-caught specimens is strongly restricted; in any case, these should be rejected because they are extremely tough to accustomize to aviary conditions. It is usually impossible, even for expert aviculturalists, to keep wild-caught birds alive for more than a few months. Captive-bred birds of several species are available, and these are far more hardy, though inexperienced aviculturalists should avoid them nonetheless. Popular in Australia and internationally, Neophema are sometimes referred to as 'grass parakeets' in avicultural literature. The most easily bred are Bourke's parrot (as Neophema), scarlet- chested parrot (N. splendida), the turquoise parrot (N. pulchella), and elegant parrot (N. elegans), the most difficult and uncommon captive is the rock parrot (N. petrophila). Aside from Bourke's parrot, all are distinguished as predominantly green birds. The orange-bellied parrot has not been commercially available due to rarity and legal restriction.

Description Skull of a northern giraffe The northern giraffe has two horn- like protuberances known as ossicones on their foreheads. The northern giraffe's are longer and larger than that of the southern giraffes', though bull northern giraffes have a third cylindrical ossicone in the center of the head just above the eyes which are from 3 to 5 inches long. Distribution and habitat The Northern giraffes live in the savannahs, shrublands and woodlands. After local extinctions in various places, the Northern giraffes are the least numerous species and the most endangered. In East Africa, they are mostly found in Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, though rarely in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. There are about 2,000 in the Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon of Central Africa. Once widespread in West Africa, a few hundreds of Northern giraffes are confined at the Dosso Reserve of Kour√©, Niger. They are common in both in and outside of protected areas. The earliest ranges of the Northern giraffes were in Chad during the late Pliocene. were once abundant in North Africa. They lived in Algeria since early Pleistocene during the Quaternary period. They lived in Morocco until their extinction around the year AD 600, as the dry climate of the Sahara made conditions impossible for the giraffes. They are also extinct in Libya and Egypt.

It was released in the United States on 4 October 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo DS. It was later released for PlayStation Portable, Game Boy Advance, and mobile phones. This was the last FIFA edition to be released exclusively on six generation consoles. The taglines for the game were \\"You play. They obey.\\" and \\"The total soccer experience.\\" FIFA 06 was the thirteenth game in the FIFA series and the tenth in 3D. At the time it was the highest selling game of the FIFA series, ahead of its predecessor FIFA 2005 by over 100,000 copies. In total, FIFA 06 has sold more than 3.6 million copies. Ronaldinho and Wayne Rooney were featured on the cover of the game in the European, Australian, Brazilian and British markets. Freddy Adu and Omar Bravo joined Ronaldinho on the North American cover, while Lukas Podolski was partnered with Ronaldinho on the German release of the game and Park Chu-Young was on the South Korea cover. Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray provide commentary for the game's English version. Game features Developers of the FIFA series made a complete overhaul of the game's engine for the 2006 installment of the game, asserting it has improved the control of play, having rewritten more than half the programming code for the game. In addition to a renovation of the game engine which discards the \\"ball\\" system, developers boast a significantly more involved career mode and the introduction of \\"chemistry\\" which will determine how good teams play together. This installment broke a short tradition of commentating from John Motson and Ally McCoist, replaced by ITV's Clive Tyldesley and Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray. =Career mode= Career mode in FIFA 06 is now a 15-year journey as the manager of a club of the player's choice. The user starts by filling in basic details such as their name, date of birth, and country. From here, the player gets to choose which team they would like to manage; however, only clubs with a 4-star rating or below are selectable unless the player has bought the \\"Career Teams\\" bundle from the in- game fan shop. In a new addition to the game players now must manage a minimum budget to build the club around. The budget can be spent on players, upgrading staff and coaches at the club and transfer budgets. Players must now also use their best managerial skills to negotiate a sponsor to the club. Sponsors, a new addition to career mode, provide a weekly payment to the club as well as extra bonuses through winning cups and meeting expectations of the club. If the manager does not meet these expectations, they may risk losing their sponsor at the end of the season. Some sponsors within the game are real organisations while others are simply made up. Players also have to manage the expectations of the board, player morale, team chemistry and keeping the club's fans happy. Ultimately, the best solution to all of these areas is to win games. Meeting the expectations of the board will almost guarantee the player a job at the club for the next season while not meeting their expectations will most likely lose the player their job and be forced to find another club. Get sacked too much and the player's career is over. Player morale becomes a large issue to the future of the player's club and their managerial future. Players must keep their squad happy to maintain them at the club and to keep them at their best performances. An unhappy squad can result in players refusing new contracts with the club and eventually leaving, which can be vital to the success of the club. Team chemistry is a result of the squad's morale and how often the current squad plays together. If the team is happy and are regularly playing together, team chemistry will be high. If the current squad is unhappy and hasn't played a game in seasons, team chemistry will be low therefore it is important to keep a balanced squad while maintaining success. FIFA 06 also introduces staff which help the club. By upgrading the staff, this helps the club to improve depending on the area that has been upgraded. For example, if the user upgrades the negotiator to a higher level, the negotiator will be able to bring better players to the club for less money. Staff upgrades cost money which comes out of the budget. Career mode also features a \\"manager history\\" section which shows your statistics as a manager for each season you play. It includes your season record, where your team finished in the ladder, and any cups the team won. Statistics for the current season are available including leading goalscorers, card recipients, team stats, league standings, and cup competition fixtures. It features three European Cup Competitions: ECC, EFA, and the European Super Cup. The ECC is the game's equivalent to the UEFA Champions League. The EFA is the equivalent to the UEFA Cup. The European Super Cup is of the same name in UEFA competition, which pits the winners of the ECC and EFA in a match right before the following season. =FIFA 06 Lounge= The FIFA 06 Lounge is a new introduction into the game. It is an upgraded form of multiplayer mode which allows up to eight human players to compete to see who is the best player over a series of matches. Each player selects a name to be identified as and a team to play as. Players can also change the rules of the game to suit their playing style. Depending on who wins and loses, players are given advantages and disadvantages to play with. Featured styles of matches in the lounge are: * Winner Stays On: The winner of the previous game plays on and faces a new challenger. * Winner vs. Highest Ranked: The winner of the previous game plays the best ranked player in the rankings * Winner vs. Lowest Ranked: The winner of the previous game faces the worst ranked player in the competition * Rematch: A rematch between the two players that just played * Rematch Switch: A rematch between the two players that just played with the home team and away team switched * Best vs. Worst: The best player vs. the worst team according to team star rating * Catch-Up: Players can set a handicapped score on one player and the disadvantaged player must attempt to catch up to the handicapped player before the game ends The mode also includes a leaderboard featuring leading point ratings, points, wins, goals, bookings, clean sheets, offsides, longest winning streak, longest undefeated streak, and longest losing streak. League standings are featured as well as the ability to save the session so players can play at a later date. =Team management= Team management gives the player the ability to edit the game to suit themselves. The mode provides the ability to create a player and edit any player, kit number, squad, and kick takers in the game as well as the ability to transfer players to other clubs and the ability to select players for their international teams. =Retro and extras= One of the new features in FIFA 06 is a special \\"retro\\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it features an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the FIFA 06 developers, and a video compilation with a retrospective view at all the games in FIFA series with \\"Cobrastyle\\" by Teddybears STHLM featuring Mad Cobra playing as the background music. Like NHL 06, and NBA Live 06, the game also has a classic 16-bit game in the PS2 version - FIFA International Soccer, which was the original game in the series. In the extras section is: * A video interview with Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. * A series of tutorial videos on how to use the new features in the game. * Video previews for NBA Live 06, FIFA Street 2, and Madden NFL 06 * Unlockable season highlights from the 2004‚Äì05 seasons of the German Bundesliga, Premier League, French Division 1, and Italian Serie A The GameCube version doesn't have the tutorial videos, video previews, or season highlights. =Challenges and unlockables= FIFA 06 has introduced challenges for the player to achieve in order to win points and unlock prizes. The challenges are divided up into 10 regions of ten to twelve challenges based on the countries they can be achieved in. There are more than 100 different challenges for the player to achieve on all four difficulty levels, although a fifth difficulty can be achieved, which is legendary. With the points earned in the challenges, prizes can be unlocked. Such unlockables in the game include classic player biographies, new camera angles, alternate club kits, stadiums, and videos. Classic XI & World League XI The game also features a Classic XI team, assembled by EA Sports, consisting of great football legends, and a World XI team, consisting of current superstars, chosen by FIFPro. Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \\"Fan Shop\\" with \\"FIFA Points\\". Trivia The Classic XI home kit is the same one used by the Allies team in the 1981 football film Escape to Victory. The away kit is also the same shirt used by the Allies team goalkeeper played by Sylvester Stallone. Reception The PlayStation 2 version of FIFA 06 received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game was met with positive to very mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 80.69% and 78 out of 100 for the PC version; 80.50% and 80 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 79.80% and 80 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 78.29% and 80 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 73.33% and 77 out of 100 for the PSP version; 66.22% and 75 out of 100 for the DS version; and 49.50% and 70 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version.

The animal often occurs in gregorious form.  Characters  The body has a flat purse like structure with length of 6-13 cms. Breadth is 4-7 cms. Colour is brownish. The animal is pretty buried in sand by means of foot. The body proper has two projections-atrial and branchial siphons. Branchial siphon has a branchial or incurrent aperture or mouth. The atrial siphon has atrial or excurrent aperture or cloaca. Each aperture is surrounded by four lobes or lips. The whole body is covered by thick leathery and translucent Tunic or test. The same is wrinkled. It is formed of cellulose like organic substances known as tunicin. Herdmania is filter or ciliary feeder. Digestive tract is complete. Liver and pyloric glands are present. Respiration is with the help of branchial sac. Water enters the body from the region of mouth or branchial aperture, passes through the pharynx where food is picked up. It comes out through atrial aperture. The current is maintained by cilia lining the gill slits. Water current also helps in gaseous exchange.  Reproduction  When disturbed, Herdmania emits a jet of water through both of its apertures. The animal is hermaphrodite. Cross fertilisation occurs which is external. Larval stage or tadpole undergoes retrogressive metamorphosis to become an adult. * References Category:Stolidobranchia Category:Tunicate genera ","title":"Herdmania"},{"id":"1914580","text":"A cognitive shift or shift in cognitive focus is triggered by the brain's response and change due to some external force. General cause A cognitive shift can occur when a person undergoes a new experience, such as astronauts experiencing the overview effect when launched into space. Cognitive shifts can occur with or without the aid of an externally ingested psychoactive substance such as LSD, peyote, or other psychoactive drugs. Religious mystic experiences are often described as a sudden shift from one cognitive function or another, for instance in the writings of William James. For example, William James described how one can shift from being anxious to calm by the \\"phenomena of seership\\" or the \\"exercise of power\\". Traditional psychology Cognitive shift (in the development of psychology) is also a term that relates to the understanding that thoughts (i.e. cognitions) play a key role in a person's emotional state and actions (behaviour). It was theorised by earlier behavioral psychologists that individuals were empty vessels and new experiences would be created by being repeatedly exposed and/or rewarded in relation to certain things (such as in rote learning of times tables). The cognitive shift however, demonstrated that thoughts also play an integral process. A key experiment placed a rat in a maze and after rotating the maze the rat was able to use pointers around the room in order to find a food reward. This suggested that the rat had used internal cognition in order to influence its behavior to gain a reward. This experiment was performed by Edward C. Tolman and he explained this phenomenon as a cognitive map. Also the fact that children, when learning a language, often and quite suddenly begin to apply rules they have learned to new phrases such as saying \\"I've drinken all my drink\\" after learning \\"I've eaten all my food\\". This is usually without being taught these rules first and as such demonstrate a key role of cognition in terms of learning. This principal is further illustrated by study conducted by Park, H. I., & Ziegler, N. (2014). Their study illustrates that overall, Cross-linguistics show a connection between language and our ability to conceptualize concepts. Linguistics influence an individual's mind from a very early age. A lot of attention has been given to the topic of bilingual cognition research due to the fact that speaking multiple languages changes the way we evaluate the perceptual attributes of our environment. One of the ways the mind of those who speak different languages differs in experience is what Pavlenko (2011) calls coexistence. By this, he means those who speak multiple languages create and maintain categories that are specific to each language and use them in accordance to the specific languages. Sachs and Coley (2006) provided evidence for co-existence through their investigation of Russian‚ÄìEnglish bilinguals‚Äô emotional. How the concepts of Jealousy and envy are understood. The results showed that those who speak multiple languages and were tested in English understood envy and jealousy the same way English monolinguals did, while those who also speak multiple languages, but were tested in Russian categorized the understood the emotions in a way similar to Russian Monolinguals. Cognitive shifts may occur after a therapist identifies an underlying fear or response mechanism and assists the client with developing remedial actions via Cognitive behavioral therapy. Psychedelic Phenomenon With the ingestion of psychedelics people often experience sudden shifts in cognitive association and emotive content. The experience can shift rapidly from negative to euphoric, and in certain cases mimic the schizophrenic condition, as researched by Humphry Osmond and others.

It may be named \`drwatson.exe\`, \`drwtsn32.exe\` or \`dwwin.exe\`, depending on the version of Windows. Overview The tool is named after Doctor Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame, the idea being that it would collect error information (symptoms) following a program crash. The use of the word \\"Watson\\" has since been expanded to include general end-user feedback services. The original name of this diagnostic tool was \\"Sherlock\\". The information obtained and logged by Dr. Watson is the information needed by technical support personnel to diagnose a program error for a computer running Windows. A text file (usually \`drwtsn32.log\`) is created whenever an error is detected, and can be delivered to support personnel by the method they prefer. A crash dump file can also be created, which is a binary file that a programmer can load into a debugger. Dr. Watson can be made to generate more exacting information for debugging purposes if the appropriate symbol files are installed and the symbol search path (environment variable) is set. When a program error occurs in Windows, the system searches for a program error handler. A program error handler deals with errors as they arise during the running of a program. If the system does not find a program error handler, the system verifies that the program is not currently being debugged and considers the error to be unhandled. The system then processes unhandled errors by looking in the registry for a program error debugger for which Dr. Watson is the default. A third-party debugger can also be used in place of Dr. Watson. The Watcom C Compiler includes a similar crash-analysis tool named \\"Dr. Watcom\\". Beginning with Windows XP, Dr. Watson (drwtsn32.exe) was extended with (dwwin.exe) \\"Problem Reports and Solutions\\". On some versions of Windows the older version (drwatson.exe) may be available by typing \\"drwatson.exe\\" into the command prompt box or in the 'Search programs and files' box in the Start menu in Windows 7\\\\.

He served as a major general in the Polish Army in overall command of Army Pozna≈Ñ during the 1939 German Invasion of Poland.:pl:Tadeusz Kutrzeba Biography Tadeusz Kutrzeba was born in Krak√≥w, a part of Austria-Hungary, since the 1795 partition of Poland. His father was a captain in the Imperial Austrian Army. In 1896, he was admitted to a military school for children in Fischau near Wiener Neustadt. He then continued his studies in the city of Hranice. Kutrzeba completed his secondary education in 1903. He graduated with distinction from the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy in M√∂dling and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, in an explosives ordnance unit. On account of his performance in school, he was given the option of choosing the location of his first posting. He chose to return to his native Krak√≥w where he was posted from 1906 to 1910. In 1910, Kutrzeba continued his military education in Vienna, studying engineering, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1911. From 1913 to 1914, he was posted to Sarajevo, where he witnessed the immediate catalyst for the outbreak of the First World War: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. World War II During the invasion of Poland in 1939, General Kutrzeba commanded the Pozna≈Ñ Army, composed of four infantry divisions (14, 17, 25, 26) and two cavalry brigades (Wielkopolska and Podolska). He devised the Polish counterattack plan of the battle of Bzura and commanded the Pozna≈Ñ and Pomorze Armies during the battle. In the aftermath, he fought his way to Warsaw and arrived in the capital on September 22, where he briefly became the deputy commander of the Warsaw Army. At the behest of major general Juliusz R√≥mmel (commander of the Warsaw Army), he began capitulation negotiations with the German 8th Army. On September 28, he signed the official surrender documents. After the siege of Warsaw, he was captured by the Germans and spent the rest of the war in several prisoner of war camps: Hohenstein, K√∂nigstein and Oflag VII-A Murnau. General Kutrzeba remained a prisoner of war until April 1945, when Oflag VII-A Murnau was liberated by American forces. Gen.

A tailwind increases the object's speed and reduces the time required to reach its destination, while a headwind has the opposite effect. In aeronautics, a headwind is favorable in takeoffs and landings because an airfoil moving into a headwind is capable of generating greater lift than the same airfoil moving through tranquil air, or with a tailwind, at equal ground speed. As a result, aviators and air traffic controllers commonly choose to take off or land in the direction of a runway that will provide a headwind. In sailing, a headwind may make forward movement difficult, and necessitate tacking into the wind. Tailwinds and headwinds are commonly measured in relation to the speed of vehicles ‚Äî commonly air and watercraft ‚Äî as well as in running events ‚Äî particularly sprints. Aeronautics calculations Pilots calculate the Headwind or Tailwind Component and the Crosswind Component of local wind before takeoff. The direction of wind at a runway is measured using a windsock and the speed by an anemometer, often mounted on the same post. Headwind and Tailwind are opposite interpretations of the wind component which is parallel to the direction of travel, while Crosswind represents the perpendicular component. Determining the ground speed of an aircraft requires the calculation of the head or tailwind. Assume: A=\\\\text{Angle of the wind origin from the direction of travel} WS=\\\\text{The measured total wind speed} CW=\\\\text{Crosswind} TW=\\\\text{Tailwind} HW=\\\\text{Headwind} Then CW=\\\\sin(A) \\\\cdot WS HW=\\\\cos(A) \\\\cdot WS For example, if the wind is at 09015 that means the wind is currently from heading 090 degrees with a speed of 15 Knots and the aircraft is taking- off from runway 24; having heading of 240. The pilot prefers the runway side with less than 90 difference from wind direction, in this case Runway 06; heading 060. Here, A=30^\\\\circ. \\\\text{Crosswind} = \\\\sin[30^\\\\circ] \\\\cdot 15 \\\\mathsf{knots} \\\\approx 7.5 \\\\mathsf{knots} \\\\text{Headwind} = \\\\cos[30^\\\\circ] \\\\cdot 15 \\\\mathsf{knots} \\\\approx 13 \\\\mathsf{knots} The aircraft is said to have 7.5 knots of crosswind and 13 knots of headwind on runway 06, or 13 knots of tailwind on runway 24. Aircraft usually have maximum tailwind and crosswind components which they cannot exceed. If the wind is at eighty degrees or above it is said to be full-cross. If the wind exceeds 100 degrees it is common practice to takeoff and land from the opposite end of the runway, it has a heading of 060 in the above-mentioned example.

It is a part of Lauterbach. History In books Allmenrod was first mentioned in 1131. The first official documents about the population in the town were found in 1854. At this time the village had a population 347 people. In the following years many people moved out of Allmenrod and into the bigger town and cities. In most cases this was the cause of the increasing poverty. =World War I and the Early Twenties= In the First World War there was a big mobilization of soldiers in the village. The total number of casualties resulted in 13 people. Their names were written down on the memorial of the cemetery. In comparison to the bigger towns, Allmenrod was not affected as much by the dearth. This depended on the high number of farms in this village. In the early twenties Allmenrod was connected to the electricity network. In these years the village also received a central water supply. =The Second World War= In the Second World War 15 villagers lost their lives. On March 29 the village was taken by the 4th Armored Division of the United States. =After 1945= In the year 1946 Allmenrod took in more than 100 displaced persons. These were rehoused in many households. In 1950 the names of the fallen soldiers of World War II were transcribed on a war memorial of the cemetery.

An emergency landing is a prioritised landing made by an aircraft in response to an emergency containing an imminent or ongoing threat to the safety and operation of the aircraft or involving a sudden need for a passenger or crew on board to be on land, such as a medical emergency. It is usually a forced diversion to the nearest or most suitable airport or airbase, in which air traffic control must prioritise and give way immediately upon the declaration of the emergency. Types There are several different types of emergency landings for powered aircraft: planned landing or unplanned landing. * Forced landing ‚Äì the aircraft is forced to make a landing due to technical problems. Landing as soon as possible is a priority, no matter where, since a major system failure has occurred or is imminent. It is caused by the failure of or damage to vital systems such as engines, hydraulics, or landing gear, and so a landing must be attempted where a runway is needed but none is available. The pilot is essentially trying to get the aircraft on the ground in a way which minimizes the possibility of injury or death to the people aboard. This means that the forced landing may even occur when the aircraft is still flyable, in order to prevent a crash or ditching situation. *Precautionary landing may result from a planned landing at a location about which information is limited, from unanticipated changes during the flight, or from abnormal or even emergency situations. This may be as a result of problems with the aircraft, or a medical or police emergency. The sooner a pilot locates and inspects a potential landing site, the less the chance of additional limitations being imposed by worsening aircraft conditions, deteriorating weather, or other factors. * Ditching is the same as a forced landing, only on water. After the disabled aircraft makes contact with the surface of the water, the aircraft will most likely sink if it is not designed to float, although it may float for hours, depending on damage. Procedures If there is no engine power available during a forced landing, a fixed-wing aircraft glides, while a rotary winged aircraft (helicopter) autorotates to the ground by trading altitude for airspeed to maintain control. Pilots often practice \\"simulated forced landings\\", in which an engine failure is simulated and the pilot has to get the aircraft on the ground safely, by selecting a landing area and then gliding the aircraft at its best gliding speed. If there is a suitable landing spot within the aircraft's gliding or autorotation distance, an unplanned landing will often result in no injuries or significant damage to the aircraft, since powered aircraft generally use little or no power when they are landing. Light aircraft can often land safely on fields, roads, or gravel river banks (or on the water, if they are float-equipped); but medium and heavy aircraft generally require long, prepared runway surfaces because of their heavier weight and higher landing speeds. Glider pilots routinely land away from their base and so most cross-country pilots are in current practice. UAV forced landing research Since 2003, research has been conducted on enabling UAVs to perform a forced landing autonomously. Notable examples Large airliners have multiple engines and redundant systems, so forced landings are extremely rare for them, but some notable ones have occurred. A famous example is the Gimli Glider, an Air Canada Boeing 767 that ran out of fuel and glided to a safe landing in Gimli, Manitoba, Canada on July 23, 1983. On June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Perth flew into a plume of volcanic ash and lost power in all four engines, three of which subsequently recovered, eventually diverting to Jakarta. On April 28, 1988, Aloha Airlines Flight 243 experienced an explosive decompression when approximately of aluminium skin separated from the fuselage. The flight was successfully diverted to Kahului Airport with only one casualty, flight attendant Clarabelle \\"C.B.\\" Lansing who was sucked out when the cabin depressurized. Flight 1549 landing on the waters of the Hudson River Less than a month later, another 737, TACA Flight 110, lost both engines due to bad weather but was able to make a successful deadstick landing on a grass levee on the grounds of NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility outside New Orleans, with minor injuries to the passengers and minor damage to the aircraft. Investigations drove the engine manufacturer, CFM International, to modify the engine design to prevent future power loss. One year later, United Airlines Flight 811, a Boeing 747, suffered a cargo door failure in-flight, separating a section of fuselage with 9 passengers and resulted in cabin depressurization. The plane made a successful emergency landing at Honolulu International Airport. More recently, Air Transat Flight 236, an Airbus A330, ran out of fuel over the Atlantic Ocean on August 24, 2001 and made a successful forced landing in the Azores. On November 1, 2011 a Boeing 767 LOT Polish Airlines Flight 016 made a belly landing after a central hydraulic system failure at Warsaw, Poland's Frederic Chopin International Airport, with no injuries. A less successful crash landing involved Southern Airways Flight 242 on April 4, 1977. The DC-9 lost both of its engines due to hail and heavy rain in a thunderstorm and, unable to glide to an airport, made a forced landing on a highway near New Hope, Georgia, United States. The plane made a hard landing and was still carrying a large amount of fuel, so it burst into flames, killing the majority of the passengers and several people on the ground. Airliners frequently make emergency landings, and almost all of them are uneventful. However, because of their inherent uncertain nature, they can quickly become crash landings or worse. Some notable instances include United Airlines Flight 232, which broke up while landing at Sioux City, Iowa, United States on July 19, 1989; and Air Canada Flight 797, which burned after landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport on June 2, 1983 after a fire started in the cabin. Shannon Airport in Ireland has a high number of emergency landings from trans-Atlantic flights, as it is the first major airport after the eastbound ocean crossing.http://www.irishcentral.com/travel/more-emergency-landings-at- shannon-as-airport-handles-unprecedented- diversionshttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/shannon-airport- handles-six-unscheduled-landings-1.2922977 On April 29, 2007, a bird was ingested into the right engine of a Boeing 757 departing Manchester (UK) airport, just as the plane rotated off the runway (flight Thomson 253H).

It flourished in the shallow seas along the Mid-Atlantic during this period. Other scallops lived at the same time, but Chesapectens were the most abundant. Physical Description Like some other large scallops, the shells of Chesapecten are characterized by a pattern of wide ribs which radiate outward from the apex of the shell. A distinctive feature of Chesapecten is that the radial ribs on its shell are crossed by much smaller, rough, concentric ribs, which follow the contours of the edges of the shell (are \\"conmarginal\\"). The left valve of Chesapecten is more convex than the right valve. The adductor muscle scar is large and rounded. Distribution The geographical distribution of Chesapecten is limited to the Atlantic coastal plain of North America, where it can be found as far south as Florida, and as far north as Delaware. One species of Chesapecten, Chesapecten jeffersonius, is the state fossil of Virginia. History of the taxonomy Chesapecten was the first genus of North American fossil to be described and illustrated; a drawing of C. jeffersonius appeared in English naturalist Martin Lister's Historiae Conchyliorum, Liber III in 1687. However, Lister did not give Chesapecten its name. Chesapecten was formally named in 1975 by the paleontologists Ward and Blackwater. In 1980, it was assigned to the family Pectinidae by Harold E. Vokes. The name Chesapecten comes from the Chesapeake Bay, where eroding cliffs and outcrops along the beaches regularly expose specimens. Habitat and behavior Chesapecten lived on the seabed in coastal waters ranging in depth from a few feet to 130 feet. When not moving, it is assumed to have rested its flatter right valve on the seafloor. It is very likely that Chesapecten could move suddenly to escape a predator by flapping its valves and using the resulting jet propulsion, in a manner similar to that of almost all living scallops. Species Different species dominated during different intervals of time: middlesexensis during the Miocene (Eastover Formation); Chesapecten jeffersonius during Early Pliocene (Lower Yorktown Formation, about 4.5 to 4.3 million years ago); and madisonius during Late Pliocene time (Upper Yorktown Formation, about 4 to 3 million years ago).

According to the surviving fragments, God was originally only one Being (hypostasis), but at the creation of the universe the Word or Logos went out from the Father and was God's Activity in the world. This Logos became incarnate in Christ and thus constituted the Image of God. The Holy Ghost likewise went forth as third Divine Person from the Father and from Christ according to John 20:22. (John 20:22 [NRSV trans.], \\"he breathed on them and said to them, \\"Receive the Holy Spirit.\\") At the consummation of all things, however, Christ would return to the Father and the Godhead would be an absolute unity again.Arendzen, John. \\"Marcellus of Ancyra.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 Dec. 2014 (1 Cor 15:28 [NRSV trans.], \\"When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things in subjection under him, so that God may be all in all.\\") The bishops at the First Synod of Tyre in 335 (which also deposed Athanasius) seem to have written to Constantine against Marcellus when he refused to communicate with Arius at Constantine's thirtieth-anniversary celebrations at Jerusalem. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote against him two works: \\"Contra Marcellum\\", possibly the prosecution document at Marcellus's trial, and \\"On the Theology of the Church\\" or \\"Ecclesiastical Theology\\", a refutation of Marcellus's theology from the perspective of Arian theology.On these two works, see Timothy Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, (Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 263-265 Marcellus was deposed at Constantinople in 336 at a council under the presidency of Eusebius of Nicomedia, the Arian, and Basil of Ancyra appointed to his see. Marcellus sought redress at Rome from Pope Julius I, who wrote to the bishops who had deposed Marcellus, arguing that Marcellus was innocent of the charges brought against him. The Council of Serdica (343) formally examined his book and declared it free of heresy. But he seems not to have been reinstated in his see when Constantius II, threatened by his brother with war, allowed the restoration of Athanasius of Alexandria and Paul of Constantinople to their sees in 345. However, the synod made Marcellus's student Photinus, who later taught a variation of Marcellus's theology, bishop of Sirmium.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 18. In 344, the Synod of Antioch excommunicated Marcellus again and drew up the Macrostich, a creed which listed their beliefs and objections to Marcellus's doctrines (among others).R. P. C. Hanson (1916-1988), The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God: The Arian Controversy, 318-381 (9780801031465) Athanasius's relations with Marcellus were complex, and communion between them was broken off for a time, but at the end of both their lives, Athanasius resisted Basil of Caesarea's attempts to have him generally condemned, and re- established communion with Marcellus. The Second Ecumenical Council condemned 'Marcellians', but not Marcellus himself. J. W. Hanson (1899) and other Universalist Church of America historians read that Marcellus's theology included a belief in universalism, that all people would eventually be saved. He is quoted by his opponent Eusebius as having said \\"For what else do the words mean, 'until the times of the restitution' (Acts 3:21), but that the apostle designed to point out that time in which all things partake of that perfect restoration.\\" (Against Marcellus 2:14)J. W. Hanson. Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years. \\"Chapter 18 Additional Authorities \\". Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House. 1899. p112 However the reference to Acts 3:21 indicates that Eusebius is probably using \\"restoration\\" apokatastasis here in the Jewish sense. Aside from the fragments which survive in Eusebius' Against Marcellus, a letter survives in Epiphanius, Panarion 72.

In regards to his leaving dhamma untranslated, Gethin summarizes (p. 151): :The point I wish to make, however, is that the usage of the word dhamma (in the plural) remains in the NikƒÅyas, canonical Abhidhamma, and even to some extent in the commentarial tradition, a somewhat ambiguous and multivalent term. Its precise understanding continues to be elusive and defies rigid or fixed definition. Possibly this is no accident and the texts delight in the very fluidity of the term. In the context of dhamma-vicaya, Gethin puts forth the idea (p. 152, also see p. 154): :In Buddhist thought to take dhamma apart is, I think, to be left with dhammas. Dhamma-vicaya means, then, either the 'discrimination of dhammas' or the 'discernment of dhamma'; to discriminate dhammas is precisely to discern dhamma. In a related footnote (p. 152, n. 38), Gethin expresses doubt about translating vicaya as \\"investigation.\\" \\"discrimination of states,\\"Bodhi (2000), SN 46 passim, pp. 1567 ff. \\"investigation of doctrine,\\"Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), pp. 615 (entry for \\"Vicaya\\"), 693 (\\"Sambojjhanga\\"). and \\"searching the Truth.\\"Rhys Davids (1900), p. 18 passim. This concept implies applying discernment to body-mind phenomena in order to apply right effort, giving way to entry into the first jhana. History In the Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka, this is the second of the Seven Factors of Awakening (satta bojjhagƒÅ). It is preceded by the establishment of mindfulness (sati) and leads to energy/effort (viriya) Together, mindfulness, discernment and effort calm the mind, and give way to the onset of the jhanas, which are characterised by the remaining four factors of awakening, namely rapture (piti), tranquility (passaddhi), concentration (samadhi) and equanimity (upekkha).See, e.g., MN 118 (Thanissaro, 2006). According to the Samyutta Nikaya, this factor is to be developed by paying continuous careful attention (yoniso manasikƒÅra bahulƒ´kƒÅro) to the following states (dhammƒÅ): wholesome and unwholesome (kusalƒÅ-akusalƒÅ); blameable and blameless (sƒÅvajjƒÅ-anavajjƒÅ); inferior and superior (hƒ´na-paƒ´tƒÅ); and, evil and good (kaha-sukka).SN 46.2 (Bodhi, 2000, p. 1569) and 46.51 (Bodhi, 2000, p. 1598). In a related end note, Bodhi (2000, pp. 1900‚Äì1, n. 59) comments: :An extended example of the opposition between good and bad states is found in MN No. 8, where the Buddha enumerates forty-four pairs of wholesome and unwholesome opposites. The explanation of this enlightenment factor suggests that while 'discrimination of states' may be technically identified with pa√±√±a [e.g., in SN 54.13 (see below) or in the Dhammasangani], the initial function of pa√±√±a as an enlightenment factor is not to discern the three characteristics, etc., but simply to discriminate between the good and bad mental states that become apparent with the deepening of mindfulness. An alternate explanation in the nikayas is that this factor is aroused by \\"discriminating that Dhamma with wisdom\\" (ta·πÉ dhamma pa√±√±ƒÅya pavicinƒÅti).SN 54.13 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1782-3; Gethin, 1992, p. 147). Gethin (1992, p. 147) remarks: \\"... [W]hat 'that dhamma' (ta dhamma) refers to is not entirely clear.\\" Pa√±√±ƒÅya is an inflected form of pa√±√±ƒÅ (Pali; Skt.: praj√±ƒÅ) that could be translated in a variety ways. For instance, as reflected here, Bodhi translates it as \\"with wisdom,\\" while Gethin (1992, p. 147) translates it as \\"by means of wisdom.\\" (Thanissaro, 1995, translates it as \\"with discernment,\\" using \\"discernment\\" for pa√±√±ƒÅ.) As suggested by Bodhi (2000, pp. 1900-1, n. 59) quoted in the preceding end note, a conventional manner of understanding pa√±√±ƒÅ here is in terms of seeing a dhamma in terms of the three characteristics of impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha) and not-self (anatta). The Abhidhamma's Dhammasai even more strongly associates dhamma vicaya with pa√±√±ƒÅ (wisdom) in its enumeration of wholesome states (kusalƒÅ dhammƒÅ): :What on that occasion is the faculty of wisdom (pa√±√±indriya)? :The wisdom which there is on that occasion is understanding, search, research, searching the Truth....Dhs 11 (Rhys Davids, 1900, pp. 17-18). where \\"searching the Truth\\" is C.A.F. Rhys Davids' translation of dhammavicayo. In later Abhidhamma texts and in post-canonical literature (such as those by the 4th- century CE Indian scholar Vasubandhu), dhamma vicaya refers to the study of dhamma as physical or mental phenomena that constitute absolute reality (Pali: paramattha; Skt.: paramƒÅrtha).For instance, Williams (2007, p. 43) writes: \\"So, in the non-Mahayana Abhidharmako≈õa BhƒÅya praj√±ƒÅ is given simply as the discernment of dharmas (dharmapravicaya), those ultimates which mark the terminating point of Abhidharma analysis.\\" See also * Bodhipakkhiya dhamma * Prajna * Three marks of existence * Vipassana Notes References * Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.)

Category:Buddhist terminology ","title":"Dhamma vicaya"},{"id":"1914673","text":"Sceliphron is a genus of Hymenoptera of the Sphecidae family of wasps, commonly referred to as mud daubers. They are solitary and build nests made of mud. Nests are frequently constructed in shaded niches, often just inside of windows or vent openings, and it may take a female only a day to construct a cell requiring dozens of trips carrying mud. Females will add new cells one by one to the nest after each cell is provisioned. They provision these nests with spiders, such as crab spiders, orb-weaver spiders and jumping spiders in particular, as food for the developing larvae. Each mud cell contains one egg and is provided with several prey items. Females of some species lay a modest average of 15 eggs over their whole lifespan. Various parasites attack these nests, including several species of cuckoo wasps, primarily by sneaking into the nest while the resident mud dauber is out foraging. As is the case with many insect genera, there are many tropical species. Some common temperate species include the black and yellow mud dauber (Sceliphron caementarium) and Sceliphron curvatum. Like other solitary wasps, Sceliphron species are not aggressive unless threatened. They are sometimes regarded as beneficial due to their control of spider populations, though the spiders themselves may be beneficial in controlling pest insects. Species such as Sceliphron curvatum are invasive in some parts of Europe, where they have been observed to rapidly increase their range in recent years.

It contains two species, both endemic to New Caledonia, one of which is extinct.  Taxonomy  Rhynochetos jubatus is the only extant species of this genus and of the family Rhynochetidae. It is closely related to tropic bird of tropical Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans with its closest living relative being the Sunbittern (Eurypyga helias). Currently there are two described species of Rhynochetos, however, it has been suggested that the extinct Rhynochetos orarius and the extant Rhynochetos jubatus are in fact the same species.  Species  * Rhynochetos jubatus Verreaux & Des Murs, 1860 ‚Äì kagu * ‚Ä†Rhynochetos orarius Balouet & Olson, 1989 ‚Äì lowland kagu  Description  Kagus are large birds described as something \\"between and small heron and a rail\\". Adults are about tall with uniform ash-grey plumage with distinct orange-red bills and legs. Characteristic of these birds are long crest feathers. They weigh between , with no significant size difference between males and females. Herons can look anatomically similar but can be distinguished by the lack of bare red parts and uniform grey plumage.  Habitat and distribution  Kagus are endemic to the small New Caledonia Island in the South Pacific, measuring 8,000 square miles. They inhabit remote, dense tropical forest regions in valleys of the southern mountainous region, as well as tall shrublands in lesser numbers. They tend to avoid shallow shrublands and savannah-grassland habitats. Typically, they require a dense canopy layer as well as a thick litter layer in which they forage for food. The distribution of Kagus over the island is very fragmented due to a very patchy forest cover. The forests lie of ultrabasic rocks, which tend to have less extensive forest cover. On these rocks, forests are restricted to higher altitudes and along water systems. Dry season fires also contribute to decreasing forest cover and thus further fragmentation of Kagu populations.  Behaviour  = Vocalizations = Kagus have distinct sex-specific songs which they sing in the early morning. These songs can carry for distances of up to 2 km. Mating pairs will often sing duets in the early morning, which may be territorial behavior. Males tend to sing more frequently than females, and solitary songs tend to belong to males more often than females. Kagu calls have been described as strange. They have various quiet hissing sounds and rattling calls. = Diet = Kagus forage most of the day for food in the litter layer and in low parts of trees and trunks. They are generalists, eating a wide variety of prey, from invertebrates such as earthworms, beetles and snails to lizards and small fish. Their food supply is influenced by seasonality, eating larger prey when there is more food availability, such as in wetter seasons. In drier seasons, Kagus will eat smaller prey such as larvae. In wetter seasons, when food is more available, they will spend less of the day foraging and carry out other activities, such as preening. = Reproduction = Kagu pairs nest in large permanent territories. Outside of breeding the male and the female will live separately within their shared territory. There is no well-defined breeding season, however, pairs tend to have more breeding attempts during wetter periods. Some young may remain in their parent's territory for several years, even helping in rearing younger siblings. Kagus raise on average about 1 hatchling yearly. The amount of breeding attempts of Kagus are very variable, with any from 0-7 breeding attempts per year possible until a successful breeding attempt takes place. They will lay and incubate a single egg for about 5 weeks. At 3 days old, the parents will feed the chick during the day and brood at night. This will occur for 2 months, at the end of which the fledgling will be two thirds of its adult body size. The fledgling will typically be fed until it reaches 3.5 to 4 months of age. Kagus have long lifespans, with many living 20 to 30 years in captivity.  Threats to conservation  Prior to the discovery of the Island by Captain James Cook in 1774, there was a healthy population of both species of Rhynochetos. Following the discovery of the island, various human activities threatened the stability of Kagu populations. The Kagus began being trapped heavily, both for its meat and for its export. The beautiful display of the male led to its export around the world to zoos and museums. Introduced domestic animals, such as cats and dogs are a major threat to the Kagus. They roam free around the island and eat adults, juveniles and eggs. Other human activity, such as logging and hunting has further fragmented their habitat. These birds tend to avoid human settlements; areas with increased human activity tend to have lower numbers. Maintenance of genetic diversity of the Kagus is therefore threatened as further fragmentation is further isolating patches and may decrease migration between the patches.

It is based on the actual Tower of Hanoi game, where the object is to transfer discs from one peg to another without disturbing their order. Whether the misspelling of the name Hanoi is accidental or intentional is not known, although the name Tower of Hanoi is also used in some rare instances. It has also been given the alternate name Tower of Pisa.\\"Tower of Pisa\\" (p.17) in Card & Dice Games by N.A.C. Bathe, Robert Frederick Ltd, 2004.. Rules First, nine cards, numbered Ace to 9 are removed from the deck. Although it is not necessary, it is a general idea that they have to be of the same suit. Then, they are dealt in 3 columns of three cards each, overlapping either in an upward or downward direction. As in the original Tower of Hanoi game, the player should follow the following rules: *Only the top card of each column can be moved. *Only one card can be moved at a time. *A card can never be put over another card lower in rank. *An empty column can be filled by a top card from either of the other two columns. As in the original, the game is won when all nine cards arranged vertically in one column from the nine at the bottom to the ace at the top. A nine-disk version of the original game takes 511 moves to complete. Considering that the cards never start the same way the disks are in the original game, it takes far fewer moves to finish this game. Variations This article explains the game with the cards overlapping to avoid confusion. There are versions of the game where the cards are laid out in a 3x3 grid and the player aims to make a vertical column with the direction of play either upwards or downwards; the rules above can be modified to suit the direction and/or manner of play.

He was part of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group and the first post-colonial generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist Bengal school and embraced Modernism instead, with its post-impressionist colours, cubist forms and brusque, expressionistic styles. Among his most noted later paintings were his triptych Celebration, which when sold for Rs 15 million ($317,500) at a Christie's auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom; his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', Santiniketan triptych series, Kali, Mahishasura (1996).Artist Tyeb Mehta dies after long illness Reuters, 2 July 2009.

Later in life, he added Falling Figures made in 1991, based on his experience of witnessing the violent death of a man in the street during the Partition of India riots of 1947, Besides adding several mythological figures into his work, highlighted by the depictions of goddess Kali and demon Mahishasura.Tyeb Mehta passes away Press Trust of India, The Statesman, 2 July 2009. Tyeb Mehta held the then record for the highest price an Indian painting has ever sold for at auction ($317,500 USD or 15 million Indian rupees) for Celebration at Christie's in 2002. In May 2005, his painting Kali sold for 10 million Indian rupees (approximately equal to 230,000 US dollars) at Indian auction house Saffronart's online auction. A reinterpretation of the tale of demon Mahishasura by Mehta showing goddess Durga locked in an embrace with the demon sold for $1.584 million. In 2008 one of his paintings sold for $2 million. In December 2005, Mehta's painting Gesture was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction. That made it the highest price ever paid by an Indian for a work of Indian contemporary art at auction in India at the time. Mehta's were the first works by a contemporary Indian artist to sell for over a million dollars, and indicated a burgeoning interest in Indian art by the international market; as a result, Mehta became a cultural hero.

It was located in both the Northern Transvaal, now Limpopo province and Eastern Transvaal, now Mpumalanga province. It must not be confused with the Gaza kingdom which once existed in Mozambique. History Gazankulu received self- rule from the central government in 1969, with its capital at Giyani. Gazankulu homeland officially starts at Elim Hospital, near Makhado, from Elim it then heads east towards the Levubu river valley, the villages of Valdezia and Bungeni being the two largest Tsonga settlements in the Levubu river valley, with a combined population of more than 50 000 people, according to the mid-2015 population statistics and stretched down up to the banks of the Sabie River near Skukuza in Hazyview in Mpumalanga. Total length of Gazankulu, from Elim Hospital to Hazyview, was 317 km long, which is a distance equivalent of travelling from Pretoria to Bandelierkop in Limpopo. The homeland consisted of the 'Mainland Gazankulu' which were Elim, Giyani and Malamulele, with 3 large exclaves, which were Bushbuckridge, Tzaneen and Phalaborwa. Before the 1913 Land Act, Bushbuckridge, Phalaborwa and Tzaneen were not Tsonga exclaves, they were physically connected with other Tsongas of Elim, Giyani and Malamulele. The 1913 Land Act resulted in 3 large Tsonga exclaves, during the 1960s, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi fought unsuccessfully against the central government's unilateral land demarcations, which unfortunately resulted in 3 large Tsonga exclaves. Despite Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi's protests at unilateral land demarcations, the central government went ahead to create 3 large Tsonga exclaves, which the Tsonga people opposed unconditionally throughout the 1960s, 1970's and 1980's. Gazankulu shared borders with other black homelands, which were, Venda, Lebowa and Kangwane. These 3 other black homelands, like Gazankulu, also experienced land grabs and unfair land allocations from the central government. Townships of Gazankulu Gazankulu had 10 formal townships, which were all created and build by the Apartheid Government from the late 1960s until the late 1980s, they are; Waterval in Elim, Giyani in Giyani, Malamulele in Malamulele, Nkowankowa in Tzaneen, Lulekani in Phalaborwa, Acornhoek in Bushbuckridge, Thulamahashe in Bushbuckridge, Dwarsloop in Bushbuckridge and Mkhuhlu in Hazyview. The above townships were curved out of land owned by local Traditional leaders or tribal chiefs. In Waterval, the land traditionally belong to of the Mukhari-Xilumani clan, in Giyani, the land belong to Hosi Risinga of the Chabalala clan, in Nkowankowa, the land belong to Hosi Muhlava II of the Nkuna clan, in Lulekani, the land belong to Hosi Majeje(M.Ntsan'wisi) of the Maluleke clan, in Thulamahashe, the land belong to Hosi Nxumalo of the Ndwandwe-Zwide clan and in Mkhuhlu, the land belong to Hosi Hoxani of the Nkuna Clan. Hospitals of Gazankulu Gazankulu had 9 district hospitals, which are; Elim Hospital in Elim, Nkhensani Hospital in Giyani, eVuxakeni Psychiatrist Hospital in Giyani, Malamulele Hospital in Malamulele, Letaba Hospital in Tzaneen, Shiluvane hospital in Tzaneen, Tintswalo Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Masana hospital in Bushbuckridge and Matikwana Hospital in Hazyview. In addition, these district hospitals are attached to more than 150 Community Health Centres and clinics. Masana Hospital was later, in 1976, given to Mapulana people, a close neighbour of Tsonga people in Bushbuckridge and is known today as Mapulaneng Hospital. Elim Hospital in Waterval, Masana Hospital in Bushbuckridge and Shiluvane Hospital in Tzaneen were Swiss Mission Hospitals, having established by the Swiss Missionaries who brought Gospel to the Tsonga people. Shopping Centres of Gazankulu Gazankulu had 16 modern shopping centres, which are; Bindzulani in Nkowankowa; Elim Mall in Elim, Hubyeni Shopping Centre in Elim, Giyani Regional Mall, Masingita shopping complex (Giyani), Masingita Mall (Giyani), Masingata Plaza (Giyani), Malamulele Crossing (Malamulele), Mangalani Shopping complex (Malamulele), Acornhoek Plaza (Bushbuckridge), Acornhoek Mall (Bushbuckridge), Thulamahashe Plaza (Bushbuckridge), Thula Mall in Thulamahashe (Bushbuckridge), Dwaarsloop Mall (Bushbuckridge) and Mkhuhlu Plaza (Hazyview). Industrial Zones of Gazankulu There were two major Industrial Zones in Gazankulu, which were Letaba in Tzaneen and Mkhuhlu in Hazyview. All Investments in the Homeland of Gazankulu were concentrated in these two towns, which were also Industrial Zones in the old Transvaal Province. Forced Removals and land reduction The land of the Tsonga people proper starts from Elim Hospital near Makhado / Louis Trichardt and ends in Skukuza near Hazyview in Mpumalanga Province. From the year 1899 until the 1960s, the land was cut off into small pieces by the Colonial Government until the Tsonga land was reduced to four territories. The cutting off of Tsonga land was in line with the 1913 Land Act, where 13% of South African land was allocated to Homelands. Under the leadership of Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi, Gazankulu has successfully resisted forced removal of Tsonga people in the following areas during the 1960s, Elim Shirley community, the central government has already finalised the plan to forcibly remove the Tsonga from Elim Shirley farms and to dump them at an arid place in around Malamulele. Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully challenged the government of the day against the forced removal of the Elim Shirley community, to this day, the Tsonga people at Elim Shirley still enjoy their land rights. Elim Hospital, which was also scheduled to be removed into a village in Malamulele, is today a living Tsonga monument within the Elim Shirley community. Valdezia community, the only remaining Tsonga community in the heart of the Levubu river, was also threatened with forced removal during the 1960s, the central government has already finalised the removal of the entire community to an unknown location. With regards to Valdezia, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi has issued a warning and declaration of war against the central government, he told Pretoria during the 1970s that \\"there will be bloodshed if the central government goes ahead and forcibly remove the people of Valdezia\\", the threat to forcibly remove the people of Valdezia went on until 1984 when the South African government announced that \\"Valdezia will no longer be removed as originally planned by the central government, rather it will be retained as a detached area of Gazankulu\\". For more than 18-years, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully resisted the forced removal of the people of Valdezia, to this day, the community of Valdezia still enjoy their land rights, which wouldn't be possible today should the central government had gone ahead with forced removal. Ribolla community of Mbhokota, Chavani, Bokisi, Riverplaats and some parts of Nwaxinyamani. As the name suggests, these communities are found on the western, southern and eastern parts of Mount Ribola, a prominent landmark mountain around Elim. Forced removals were a reality in this part of Gazankulu. These lands were collectively known as the \\"Tsonga finger\\" by the apartheid government and the Tsonga people were to be removed in their great numbers, this is a proud home of the Tsonga people in the Elim area. Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully claimed back the \\"Tsonga finger\\"after the central government failed to forcibly removed the tsonga people. After a successfully land claims by Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi, the land became known as the \\"Tsonga finger\\" because on the South African map, it looks like a finger. However, after the central government's failure to remove all the Tsonga people from the \\"Tsonga finger\\", they did manage to remove one Tsonga chief from his land, Hosi Bokisi in 1968. In 2016, a descendant of the late chief Bokisi managed to get back all his grandfather's land that was taken, the old Bokisi has been claimed back and chief Bokisi has demarcated residential stands, next to chavani village, alongside the Elim road. Bungeni community, the largest Tsonga settlement in the Levubu river valley and the most populous Tsonga settlement in the whole Elim area, was, alongside its neighbour, Valdezia community, to be removed from the entire area completely and relocated into unknown location. Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully claimed back the entire Bungeni community against the central government's intention to forcibly remove them from the entire Levubu valley. To this day, the Bungeni community still enjoy their land rights, a right that wouldn't have been possible if they were removed. The Bungeni community is still waiting for the transfer of the eastern part of Nwaxinyamani village back into its tribal authority, the piece of land was stolen during the 1960s when demarcation was done between Nkhensani tribal authority (people of Chavani village) and Bungeni tribal authority (people of Bungeni). The piece of land that must transferred back to Bungeni is known as Skhosana village, which is today part of nwaxinyamani, during the 1960s, that land belonged to Hosi Makhoma Skhunyani, and if everything goes according to plan, Bungeni new stands, under Hosi Makhoma Skhunyani, will be joined with Skhosana village and form part of Hosi Makhoma's land. Lost chieftainship and their lands Hosi Mtsetweni During the 1960s, many Vatsonga chiefs lost their status as senior chiefs and have their lands greatly reduced when homelands were created and political boundaries demarcated. One of the most important chief in the Elim area to have his land and chieftainship taken away was Hosi Mtsetweni, a fully fledged senior chief with a vast land. After he was de-recognized by the government, he was given to Hosi Bungeni as his headman, his land greatly reduced into a very small village called ka-Mtsetweni 3 km south of Levubu Agricultural plantation. Before he was de-recognized by the government in 1960, he had the same status as Hosi Bungeni, also in terms of land mass. After the 1994 democratic elections, the new government is still trying to solve this problem through its Katla commission. Hosi Bokisi Another important chief in the Elim area had his chieftainship interfered with, his land was reduced into a small village on a mountain slope just east of Elim. He was given to Hosi Chavani as his headman. Hosi Bokisi, just like Hosi Mtsetweni, is a fully fledged senior chief of the Bokisi community but was reduced to a status of a headman, his land greatly reduced to few hundred hectares '''''' This is a paramount chief of all Vatsonga in the whole Makhado area, his jurisdiction covers almost all areas where Tsonga people live in the Makhado area. However, his paramountancy as chief of all Vatsonga in the Makhado area was highly contested by Jo√£o Albasini, who declared himself chief of all Vatsonga people in the Makhado area. The paramount chieftainship was lost in 1930 upon the death of at waterval Shirley farm, after the death of the great , the whole village of Elim was run and managed by the Swiss Mission Church, known today as Evangelical Presbyterian Church in South Africa (EPCSA). The Swiss missionaries at Elim were responsible for the disappearance of paramount chieftainship since they are the ones that decided that Elim, as a 'Capital' site of the Swiss Mission Church in South Africa, should be run and managed by the Church, as a result, no new chief of the clan was appointed after 1930. The Swiss Mission Church in South Africa was later, during the 1960s, to play a positive role and to the benefit of the chieftainship since they actively opposed the forced removal of the Elim Shirley Community. Between 1930 up until 1995, the chieftainship disappeared from the scene, it was only restored in 1995 by President Nelson Mandela. However, the status of as a paramount chief was not restored, he was only recognised as a senior chief. However, during the 1960s, the apartheid government gave some form of recognition to the chieftainship, the incumbent was given a status of an independent headman without a chief, but a tribal office was not granted until 1995. The land of was greatly reduced in size, only the villages of Elim, Lemana, Shirley, Waterval, Magangeni, eka-Mabobo and were left for him to exercise his authority. Hosi Malele The fate that befell hosi Malele and his Wayeni community during the 1960s was rather regrettable. His land was reduced into a small village and his seniority taken away, he was given to Hosi Bungeni as his headman. Malele' land was big and he occupied the rolling hills southeast of Elim known to the apartheid government as \\"Bellevue\\". Hosi Malele was an independent senior chief with a big land like hosi Bokisi. Today, he is trying to reassert his autonomy by refusing to participate in the Bungeni tribal authority since originally he never reported nor fell under Hosi Bungeni. Hosi Mahatlani Sibisi Just like hosi Malele of Wayeni, hosi Mahatlani's land became a dumping ground for all communities that were removed from their land by the apartheid government and dumped on his land. The village of Ribungwani and Masakona have taken land that previously fell under hosi Mahatlani's jurisdiction. In 1960, hosi Mahatlani was de-recognised by the apartheid government and handed over to Hosi Bungeni as his Induna. Today, hosi Mahatlani is considered a rebel at Bungeni village because he is refusing to participate in the Bungeni tribal authority as an induna. Just like hosi Mtsetweni, his chieftainship is currently being investigated by the kgatla commission. Hosi Skhunyani The land on the beautiful hill east of Nwanancila river known today as Skhosana village (under headman Nwaxinyamani) up until the eastern side of Rivolwa mountain and the village of Bodwe is the land of Headman Skhunyani and his people. They were expelled in 1960 and dumped at a village known today as Bungeni new stands. Headman Skhunyani, along with headman Nwaxinyamani, are the original headmen of Hosi Bungeni and fell under the jurisdiction of Hosi Bungeni from the time they took up the land some centuries ago. Consequently, Skhunyani, known today as Skhosana, is the original land of Hosi Bungeni Gazankulu today Gazankulu, as a political entity, no longer exists, it is today part of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. In 1994, Gazankulu was sub-divided into different municipalities cross-cutting linguistic and cultural boundaries, a feature of a new democratic South Africa. The western district of former Hlanganani was allocated to Makhado Local Municipality (130 000 people), the southern part of Hlanganani was divided and allocated to Greater Letaba Local Municipality (45 000 people), while the eastern part of Hlanganani was allocated to Greater Giyani Local Municipality (35 000 people). In total, Hlanganani district lost 80 000 people to both the Greater Giyani and Greater Letaba local Municipalities in 1994, while Makhado local municipality was the biggest beneficiary of the former Hlanganani district, it took more than 130 000 people from the former Hlanganani in 1994 when the district was broken-up. The Greater Giyani Local Municipality was merged with some parts of Bolobedu (Northern Sotho speaking), Malamulele was merged with Thulamela Local Municipality and Lulekani was merged with Namakgale to form a new Municipality with Phalaborwa known as Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. Shiluvane, under Hosi Muhlaba and other Tsonga areas in Ritavi has been merged to form Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality. In Bushbuckridge, the whole area has been merged with Northern Sotho and the Swazi to form Bushbuckridge Local Municipality. The population of the former Gazankulu, according to the 2011 census, is spread out as follows; Limpopo 1.1 million or 17% of the province, Mpumalanga 500 000 or 11.5% of the province and Gauteng 800 000 or 4% of the province. Total population is 2,3 million or 5% of South Africa's population. All the Tsonga people working and schooling in Gauteng comes from Gazankulu, so the 800 000 Tsonga people in Gauteng have their homes in Gazankulu, it can, therefore, be assumed that when these Tsonga people return to Limpopo and Mpumalanga during Easter and December holidays, the Tsonga population in both Limpopo and Mpumalanga rises sharply.

Course types Main types of course: =Flow diversion= These work by diverting a natural river through boulder placement or damming, or by creating new channels next to an existing river, possibly by a weir or power station outflow. =Tidal action= Created in estuaries with large tidal reaches, on a barrage across the river. The barrage is opened during a rising high tide to allow the sea water in, then shut as the tide turns. The water stored above the barrage is then forced through an artificial channel to provide water features. =Pumped= The nature of artificial whitewater courses necessitates the need for a drop in the river, and enough water flow to provide hydraulics. When this isn't possible (often in flat low-lying areas), electric pumps are used to lift and re-circulate the water to the top of the course. The shapes of these courses are commonly circular or U-shaped. Pumped courses are extremely expensive to run, typically 1-2 megawatts of electrical power are needed to pump 15 cubic metres per second of water down a course with a 5-meter drop in height. = Altered Riverbed = These courses are created in existing natural river channels, but are enhanced with strategic placement of new rocks, boulders, or concrete structures. Some are downstream of river or channel wide dams and therefore have some level of flow optimization, others are subject to seasonal flows.

Established in 1925, Tanglin Trust School provides British-based learning with an international perspective for students aged 3‚Äì18. There are approximately 2,720 students at Tanglin, with 740 in the Infant School, 770 in the Junior School and 1190 in the Senior School and Sixth Form. Each school has its own building and facilities within the one campus. Approximately 60‚Äì70% of students in the school are British passport holders, although this is not an admissions requirement. As at May 2014, 54 nationalities are represented. Very few Singaporean students attend the school as the Singapore government's regulations prevent most of its citizens from attending international schools, hence only 4% of the student body of international schools in Singapore are Singaporean. In its last four inspections in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Tanglin Trust School was awarded Outstanding, the highest possible grade under the Ofsted-recognised British Schools Overseas framework. Admissions criteria The two admissions criteria to enter the school are that a student must have a level of English sufficient to access the curriculum and the school has the capacity to support a students' learning support needs. Waiting lists exist for some year groups. Children of staff and prospective students who have siblings already attending the school are some of those given priority on the waiting lists. A Placement Rights scheme exists to facilitate accelerated entrance into the school. Students may be asked to submit a sample of work, attend an interview or complete an exam depending on the circumstances. Academics The English National Curriculum provides the basis for the programmes of study which are enriched to reflect the calibre of students and the school's international setting. Infant School students are aged between 3 and 7 and the curriculum they follow is the Early Years Foundation Stage in Nursery and Reception followed by Key Stage 1 in Years 1 and 2. Students in the Junior School, aged between 7 and 11, follow Key Stage 2 in Years 3 to 6. Students in the Senior School, including those in the Sixth Form, are aged 11 to 18 years. They study Key Stages 3 in Years 7 to 9; Key Stage 4 in Years 10 and 11; and Key Stage 5 in Years 12 and 13. As students progress through Key Stage 3 to 5 of the English National Curriculum, they are presented with a widening choice of subjects to choose from for their General Certificate of Secondary Education (I/GCSE) and A Level or IB examinations. The school achieves impressive International Baccalaureate, A-Level and GCSE results enabling graduates to enter their universities of choice in the UK as well as other leading institutions around the world. Outside the classroom At Tanglin there is a strong belief in the value of learning outside the classroom. The development of the child as a whole is paramount and it is recognised that different students are motivated by different experiences. Hence students can take part in a wide array of co-curricular activities and challenging residential field studies to enrich their learning experience. In addition to year group outdoor education programmes to destinations right across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, there is also a range of curriculum-based and optional discovery programmes including skiing in Switzerland, an adventure week in Western Australia, studying art in Bali, brushing up language skills in Barcelona and even a chance to climb to Everest Base Camp. The school also offers the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Scheme, operating under the Singapore designation of The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA).National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Sport is an integral part of the Tanglin curriculum. Athletics, basketball, swimming, football, rugby, netball, tennis, gymnastics, badminton, cricket, golf, tee-ball, softball and volleyball are all established activities that have well-developed training programmes in place and offer participants the opportunity to compete in inter-school events, both in Singapore as well as overseas. Sports facilities at the school include: air-conditioned sports halls within each of the schools; an eight-lane 25-metre swimming pool and learner pool; tennis courts; playing fields; running track; athletics facilities and a fitness centre. Tanglin has a sustained commitment to The Athletics Conference Singapore International Schools (ACSIS)Athletics Conference Singapore International Schools (ACSIS) sporting structure which underpins the school's continued involvement in local sports. This is further supported through participation in overseas sport at regular tournaments and competitions through the South East Asia Student Activity Conference (SEASAC) and the Federation of British Schools in Asia (FOBISIA), as well as sporting tours to destinations around Asia, the Middle East and Australia. Moreover, the school embraces the performing arts, with well-established choirs, orchestras, dance show cases and concerts. The performing arts facilities include several performance halls, fully equipped drama and dance studios, a film studio and a state-of-the-art music department which includes practice rooms, a music IT suite supported by iMacs and electronic keyboards, a main rehearsal space for larger groups and a professional recording and performance studio. Tanglin also participates in regional events involving the Arts such as the International Schools Theatre Association (ISTA) events. TTS Foundation Our World Projects TTS Foundation Limited (TTS Foundation) was established in May 2012 and was registered as a charity in June 2013. It was set up as a fundraising entity and is managed by the Development Office at Tanglin. TTS Foundation currently has start-up funding which does not come from school fee income. It was established to support enrichment activities and projects beyond the regular curriculum and to enhance the educational experiences of students at Tanglin Trust School. It does this by administering the Our World Fund which support projects that benefit the school community. These range in nature and size and include a scholarship and awards programme as well as Our World projects. Each project has to qualify individually for funding and must adhere to Tanglin Trust School's mission statement History Anne Griffith-Jones, OBE (1890‚Äì1973). The school was founded in 1925 by Anne Griffith-Jones. It is the second oldest International School in Singapore after the Japanese School. When it opened, it operated from premises within the Tanglin Club. It began with five students, but soon began to grow rapidly. At the time, many British expatriates living in Singapore sent their children away to boarding school in Britain at an early age. The school offered the alternative of providing British-style education in Singapore, so parents could postpone boarding school until an older age. In 1934, Griffith-Jones opened a second school ‚Äì the Tanglin Boarding School in the Cameron Highlands (now part of Malaysia). Again this was intended as a nearby alternative for expatriate families living in the region who would otherwise have to send their children to boarding schools in Britain. Many children who attended the school in Singapore up to the age of eight then went on to the boarding school in the Cameron Highlands, which catered for students up to the age of 13. However the school in Singapore continued to flourish. Anne Griffith-Jones (centre) receiving her retirement gifts in 1957 from Dr Charles Wilson and Laurette Shearman, two of Tanglin's first intake of pupils. The Japanese occupation of the Malay Peninsula in 1942 forced the closure of both schools, as British expatriates in the region (including Griffith-Jones) were interned by the Japanese. The schools reopened after the war. From 1948, the unsafe conditions created by Malayan Emergency meant the school in the Cameron Highlands had to be put under full-time armed guard and children were transported to and from school in armoured vehicles at the end and start of term. The Cameron Highlands School was eventually forced to close by the Federal Government for security reasons in 1950 and the school was sold to the British War Office. In 1958, Griffith-Jones retired and sold the private company Tanglin School Ltd to the British European Association (now known as the British Association of Singapore)Short history of the British Association of Singapore in Singapore. In 1961, governance of the school was handed over to a non-profit education Trust known as the Tanglin Trust Ltd. In 1971, the Trust opened a second British international primary school in Singapore called Weyhill Preparatory School. Three years later the Trust also took over the running of another international school in Singapore called Raeburn Park School, which had been opened in 1954 by the Singapore Harbour Board for the children of its expatriate staff. In 1981, the three schools were merged into one at its present campus on Portsdown Road. Initially, the campus housed two largely separate-functioning infant and junior schools known as Tanglin Infant School and Tanglin Junior School. A separate nursery school (known as Winchester Nursery School) also operated at Alexandra Park for twenty years between 1976 and 1996, but this was moved to the new purpose-built Infant School on the Portsdown Road campus in 1996. In the late-1980s, the administration and curriculum of the schools was centralised under a single Head Teacher and in 1996 the name Tanglin Trust School was adopted. Alumni and Friends of Tanglin The school has an alumni community which is designed to help current and former students stay in touch with each other and with Tanglin. Alumni from schools pre-dating Tanglin Trust School: Tanglin School, Tanglin Preparatory School (TPS), Weyhill Preparatory School (WPS), Raeburn Park School (RPS) and Winchester Nursery are encouraged to reconnect through the Tanglin Alumni community. Additionally there is a Friends of Tanglin network which is open to all current and former teachers, support staff, Governors and parents. =Notable alumni= * Mimi Slinger ‚Äì English actress *Ming Bridges ‚Äì Singaporean singer-songwriter, actress and model See also *Education in Singapore *International Baccalaureate References External links *Official website Category:International schools in Singapore Category:British international schools in Asia Category:1925 establishments in Singapore Category:Educational institutions established in 1925 ","title":"Tanglin Trust School"},{"id":"1914718","text":"Hammerstein is a fictional robot created by Pat Mills and Kevin O'Neill,Macmanus, Steve 'The Mighty One', p93 who first appeared in 1978 as a member of Ro-Busters in the British comic Starlord but is best known as the leader of the ABC Warriors in 2000AD. Physical description Hammerstein is described as a Mark III war droid and was commissioned in the early 21st Century to fight in the Volgan Wars. Hammerstein's right hand is a hammer that is used in hand-to-hand combat while on the back of his left he has a missile launcher. There are tank tracks on his feet to aid mobility. Hammerstein also has two sockets in his waist to attach auxiliary arms but he finds these embarrassing. During combat operations his head has a grim human like face but after he was decommissioned this was replaced with 'civilian' head that features a single square 'eye'. Fictional character biography =The Volgan War= Years after the Volgan occupation of Western Europe,2000AD Prog 1-50: Invasion! the United States began a counter-invasion to, officially, liberate the area; unofficially, Earth's oil reserves were running low and they wanted to seize the Volgan's oil reserves.Prog 2007: The Volgan War. To do this they created expendable robot soldiers - ABC Warriors - designed to wage war across any terrain in any kind of combat, atomic, bacterial or chemical. The first of their number were called Hammersteins. Developed by Howard Quartz's Ro-Busters corporation, they first saw use at Fishguard in 2009, leading the Allied liberation of the United Kingdom.Savage Book Five: 1984, Prog 1641 The first two models were failures. The Mk I robot was an effective killer but could not distinguish between targets on their own, killing civilians as well as Volgan soldiers. When controlled remotely by human soldiers in 2009, the Volgans were able to seize control and redirect them against American forces, driving them back across Wales and causing the American public to protest the use of war-robots. Thousands of Hammersteins were destroyed for fear of Volgan reprogramming.Savage Book Six: Crims, Prog 1689 The later Mk II was given an artificial intelligence, with different stories giving different reasons why they failed. In the original Ro-Busters story, that meant Mk II platoons surrendered to the Volgans instead of fighting;2000AD Prog 88-89, Ro-Busters: Hammerstein's War Memoirs in the later ABC Warriors, the MK II's were said to be given \\"genuine moral values\\" and had become pacifists, and were killed for trying to convert human soldiers;Prog 562, \\"ABC Warriors: The Black Hole\\" and in Savage, the MK II's ethical values included the price of collateral damage and they surrendered rather than damage the property values of Virginia Water (a deliberate set-up by the US so the British insurgency groups would be culled).Prog 1819: \\"Savage Book 8: Rise Like Lions\\" The Mk III Hammerstein was given artificial values and emotions such as patriotism, believing the enemy is always evil, and that war is necessary to protect national interests - just enough to stop him slaughtering civilians but not question why he was fighting. Initially, his master program could not accept the secondary programs because of their logical contradictions. His programmer and a 'robopsychologist' tried to get them in sync by forcing him to feel emotions; the first genuine he felt was jealousy that they were a couple, and he murdered them without understanding why.ABC Warriors: The Black Hole The first Mk III Hammerstein would be the template for those that followed. He was field-tested by having him serve with a human regiment; he faced and overcame robophobia from his comrades and came to be a trusted soldier under Sergeant \\"Country\\" Farmer's command. The human generals were pleased by this and began to withdraw human soldiers & mass-produce robot ones.2000AD Prog 88-92, Ro-Busters: Hammerstein's War Memoirs Hammerstein was promoted to sergeant and began to lead the new war robots; as a result he was one of the few whose movements weren't remotely controlled by human generals. Despite his programming, he showed a paternal interest in the other Hammerstein units under his command2000AD Prog 2007: The Volgan War and at one point disobeyed orders to save them from Volgan Stalins. He also became disillusioned due to the constant horrors of war and robots being used as cannon fodder by the humans. He once removed the pain barrier - which allowed humans to remotely experience a Warrior's actions but not its pain - from a dying comrade to put him out of its misery; this killed the officer in the process, but nothing was ever proved. =The Mars Mission and Ro-Busters= He was the first ABC Warrior recruited by the mysterious Colonel Lash to work as Martian peacekeepers near the end of the war, and gathered the other recruits. His distrust of humans increased when he was ordered to recruit the Volgan butcher Blackblood and when he discovered that his fellow ABC Warriors were being slaughtered by the humans following victory. Nevertheless, Hammerstein and Colonel Lash took the newly formed team to Mars to tame the devil planet and finally bring peace to its red plains. Following their success, the Warriors returned to Earth and separated. Hammerstein ended up with a new head and a different personality to go with it. He was eventually sold as army surplus to the much feared Ro-Busters Disaster Ltd, which saw him serving alongside the sewer robot Ro-Jaws. After helping to save countless human lives (and once going on a rampage in London after his programming reverted to the war years), Hammerstein and Ro-Jaws thwarted a plot by Ro-Buster's owner to kill all the robots for insurance money. He helped mount a mass robot escape to Saturn Six, a moon taken over by robots years before; he felt he could be made a general on this free world and viewed this as meaning he would not associate with Ro-Jaws anymore. He threw this dream away in order to cover the robots escape, fighting alongside Ro-Jaws and ten other brave robots - entering Saturn Six legend as The Hero Dozen - to cover the other robot's escape. The two of them then walked off with new identity papers singing as they went, admitting that despite their wildly different personality clashes they were still mates and would be stuck walking \\"side by side\\".2000AD Prog 103-115, Ro-Busters: The Rise and Fall of Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein =Nemesis the Warlock= As the centuries passed, Hammerstein realised war was all he knew, and decided to re-join the army. With a number of other ABC War robots, he was brought into service by Torquemada's Terminator armies during the invasion of the Gothic Empire.Nemesis the Warlock Book 4 After being caught showing mercy to alien civilians, he and two comrades Mad Ronn and Hitaki - were reprogrammed and sent on a suicide mission. The mission was thwarted by Nemesis the Warlock, who reformed the ABC Warriors to help save the Gothic Empire from invasion and later to train the Goths in combat. They re-joined Nemesis as he ventured into the Time Wastes of Termight to find his son, Thoth. With Mad Ronn lost, their numbers were bolstered by Hammerstein's former Ro-Busters comrade Mek-Quake. The team ventured to the end of the world, and lost a second member when Hitaki was killed during the first encounter with the Monad. Adding Ro-Jaws to the team, The Warlock dispatched The Warriors into the Time Wastes alone to repair the damage done by Thoth, and stop the destruction of the planet. =The Black Hole and Khaos= During the mission, Hammerstein met and became close to a human female, Terri, who believed herself to be a robot. She had mistaken him for Craig, the father of her baby, and became equally infatuated with the ageing warrior; without the proper modifications, however, Hammerstein had no way to return her affections. The two became fiercely protective of each other, and made plans to find some remote planet and settle down. With Terri's untimely death during the final confrontation with the Monad, Hammerstein realized he was doomed to be an eternal soldier, only finding pleasure in war and destruction. He temporarily relinquished command to Deadlock, which saw the Warriors drawn into his quest to bring Khaos to the galaxy. For most of this mission, Hammerstein was bewildered and disgusted by the task and the lunatic excesses of his comrades. The most reluctant of all The Warriors to embrace Khaos, he finally realized that he did not have to obey orders any longer and renounced Deadlock's leadership. The Warriors went their own ways. Hammerstein agreed to let Blackblood (now an arms dealer) give him a service, only to find himself welded to a workbench, used for testing new weaponry and deliberately tortured for five years. With the help of Deadlock, Hammerstein escaped and pulled the Warriors together again to stop the Terran ship Hellbringer. During this, it was shown he was loyal to Khaos and had some understanding of it, more so than some of his comrades like Joe. In the battle against Hellbringer a demon overloaded his neural net with all the repressed guilt from his long career, almost killing him before he took out his fury on the demon. He also discovered the other Warriors had all known he was being tortured but had deliberately not come to save him, as \\"Nobody likes a nice guy!\\" - Morrigun even informed him that his innate goodness was against the order of things and this was why bad things happened to him. =Return To Mars= He led the team back to Mars afterwards, initially to tackle a group of zombies calling themselves the Jung Cannibals. They were caught in the Medusa War where Medusa, the planetary consciousness, tried to wipe out her human settlers. Hammerstein struck a deal with the spirit and kidnapped human Mars President D.W. Cobb, though he didn't know Deadlock planned to turn Cobb into a Martian as an act of appeasement. Cobb's 'transformation' sparked a civil war, with the Confederacy of Martian Industries on one side and the Union of Martian Free States on the other. Hammerstein led the ABC Warriors in attempting to force a peace, leading to the Confederacy hiring a seven-strong robot mercenary gang called the Shadow Warriors to assassinate them. The battle saw Hammerstein infected with parasitical brain-eating robot snakes,2000AD Prog 1479 forced to be killed or let them kill his comrades, and though he escaped the situation he was left severely wounded. He managed to kill the Warrior responsible, Doc Maniacus, with his own snakes. Currently, Hammerstein is leading the ABC Warriors to rescue Zippo, a robot comrade from the Volgan War.

In this story, Hammerstein rejoined the American army after the Mars mission, serving under General Blood 'n' Guts in President Robert L. Booth's robot armies. Following the great Atomic Wars of 2070, Hammerstein fought in The Battle of Armageddon against the Mega City Judges. Following the robot's defeat, Hammerstein was trapped under the Cursed Earth for decades before emerging, whereupon he faced off against Judge Dredd. Realizing the war was over and the Judges were no longer his enemy, Hammerstein became unsure of his purpose. However, the subsequent story ABC Warriors: The Volgan War removes this story from continuity by having the original war against the Volgans taking place in 2083,Prog 2007 13 years after the Atomic Wars in Judge Dredd. In other media Hammerstein appears as a decommissioned ABC Warrior in the 1995 film Judge Dredd, acting as Rico's bodyguard once reactivated.

One level of cliff dwellings is over long and the second is about long. The dwellings were carved out of soft volcanic tuff on about a cliff ridge. The rock is relatively soft and can be excavated using wooden tools. The cliff dwellings held about 740 rooms and ruins at the base of the cliff that likely held additional dwellings.Puye Cliff Dwellings - Ancestral Home of the Santa Clara Indians. Legends of America. 2003-2011. Retrieved 10-14-2011. On top of the mesa are cave dwellings of the Pueblo II Era around which a multi-storied puebloan village was built. The south portion of the complex had 173 rooms on the ground floor. The total number of rooms is not known, but would include rooms on the northern side of the complex and the upper levels. In the center of the complex was a large plaza. About 1580 (after the end of the Pueblo IV Era) drought finally forced the villagers to leave for locations nearer to the Rio Grande valley. Present day inhabitants of Santa Clara Pueblo, some to the east, are descendants of the Puye. The American Indians living in pueblos in northern New Mexico traditionally speak the Tewa language. The Tewa name 'Puye' can be translated as 'pueblo ruin where the rabbits assemble or meet'.Harrington, John Peabody. (1916) The Ethnogeography of the Tewa Indians. Washington: Government Printing Office. p. 262. In 1907 Edgar Hewett, with the Southwest Society of the Archeological Institute of America, excavated Puye Cliffs. It was the first systematic excavation of a prehistoric pueblo in the Rio Grande valley.

Bathe, Robert Frederick Ltd, 2004. and is based on an old Japanese game.\\"Flower Garden\\" (p.138) in The Playing Card Kit by Richard Craze, Simon & Schuster, 1995. It is also known under the names The Bouquet and The Garden. The terms used in this game are related to gardening. Some skill is needed to successfully complete the game, and skilful players can win more than 20% of the time. Rules Thirty-six cards are dealt in to six columns, each containing six cards. The columns are called the \\"flower beds\\" and the entire tableau is sometimes called \\"the garden.\\" The sixteen leftover cards become the reserve, or \\"the bouquet.\\" Some sources instead refer to this reserve as the \\"seeds\\", and the built-up foundations as the \\"bouquets\\".\\"Flower Garden\\" (p.138) in The Playing Card Kit by Richard Craze, Simon & Schuster, 1995. The initial layout in the game of Flower Garden The top cards of each flower-bed and all of the cards in the bouquet are available for play. Cards can only be moved one at a time and can be built either on the foundations or on the other flower beds. The foundations are built up by suit, from Ace to King (a general idea of the game is to release the aces first). The cards in the garden, on the other hand, can be built down regardless of suit and any empty flower bed can be filled with any card. The cards in the bouquet can be used to aid in building, be put into the foundations, or fill an empty flower bed. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. Variations An slightly easier variant of Flower Garden uses a tableau with seven columns of only five cards each, and a reserve of 17 cards. Other variations include Wildflower (allows sequences to be moved), Brigade, and Stonewall.

According to tradition, its construction was ordered by Ancus Marcius around 642 BC, but this date is approximate because there is no ancient record of its construction. Marcius wished to connect the newly fortified Janiculum Hill on the Etruscan side to the rest of Rome, augmenting the ferry that was there. The bridge was part of public works projects that included building a port at Ostia, at the time the location of worked salt deposits.Griffith, A.B., 2009,\\"The Pons Sublicius in Context: Revisiting Rome's First Public Work,\\" Phoenix 63, 296-322  Construction  Drawing of the site of the Pons Sublicius (falsely shown as a pier), Illustration of Rome during the time of the Republic, from Friedrich Polack (1896) Legend tells us that the bridge was made entirely of wood. The name comes from Latin pons, pontis, \\"bridge,\\" and the adjective sublicius, \\"resting on pilings,\\" from the stem of sublicae, pilings. As a sublica was a pick, sublicae implies pointed sticks; that is, the bridge was supported by pilings driven into the riverbed. Julius Caesar‚Äôs engineers used this construction to bridge the Rhine. The bridge was rebuilt repeatedly. The date of its final disappearance is not known, but it is not in classical times. The Via Latina went over the bridge and connected to the Via Cassia, a road built over an old Etruscan road that led to Veii. The bridge was a favorite resort for beggars, who used to sit upon it and demand alms, hence the Latin expression \\"aliquis de ponte\\" for a beggar. The bridge was downstream from the Pons Aemilius, a good stone bridge with which it is sometimes confused. Between the two, the Cloaca Maxima, or Great Sewer, was effluent into the Tiber. In the drawing by Friedrich Polack (published 1896) included with this article the pile bridge is falsely shown as a pile pier. Presumably some structure still existed prior to 1896, which was incorrectly identified. Otherwise the drawing appears to be accurate in the major details. The observer is standing on the Via Ostiensis at the foot of the Aventine, which is at his back. The river flows toward him. The stone bridge in evidence is the Pons Aemilius. The Servian Wall goes along the bank of the river, is pierced by the Porta Trigemina (you can see the three openings) and starts up the Aventine. Beyond the gate is the Forum Boarium. In the immediate foreground are the docks, or Navalia. The pier is highly unlikely, as any ship tied up at it as shown would be unstable in the full force of the current. Moreover, the masts would have to be shipped for passage under the bridges. One can readily see how unsuitable the river was for sea-going traffic and how necessary the port of Ostia would have been to Rome. The opening of the Cloaca Maxima is between the docks and the stone bridge. Beyond the bridge you can just see the Aesculapium on Tiber Island. Looming over the whole scene is the Capitoline, with the temple of Juppiter Capitolinus upon it. The rising ground on the opposite side of the stone bridge is the Janiculum.  Horatius Cocles at the bridge  The legend of Publius Horatius Cocles at the bridge appears in many classical authors, most notably in Livy. After the overthrow of the Roman monarchy in 509 BC, the exile of the royal family and the king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and the establishment of the Roman Republic, Tarquinius sought military aid to regain the throne from the Etruscan king of Clusium, Lars Porsena. Porsena led his army against Rome in 508 BC. The battle went badly for the Romans, and the Etruscan army surged towards the bridge. The Romans initially fell back. However, Horatius, with the assistance of Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius Aquilinus, sought to buy time and halt the attack by defending the opposite end of the bridge while the Roman soldiers broke the bridge.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.9-15 In modern English literature, the story of Horatius at the bridge was re-told by Thomas Babington Macaulay in his poem Horatius, published as part of his Lays of Ancient Rome (1842).  Gaius Gracchus at the bridge  The Pons Sublicius is also the bridge over which Gaius Gracchus directed his flight when he was overtaken by his opponents (Plutarch, Life of Gaius Gracchus). Two of his friends attempted to stop them at the bridge, but were themselves killed. Gracchus died violently shortly after in a grove nearby. Roman citizens cheered on the flight of Gracchus but would not assist him. Gracchus' choice of an escape route was probably intended to make use of the magical powers attributed to the bridge, but it failed.  Ritual of the Argei  On the Ides of May, the procession of the Argei went from the temple of Fors Fortuna, built by Servius Tullius, to the pons Sublicius. (There is no reference for this version of events; this ritual is somewhat unclear and may be the same as the Roman Liberalia.) Alternately, Samuel Ball Platner explains that the ritual involved priests travelling to all (27 or 30) of the shrines (sacella) called Argei in the original 4 regions of Rome before arriving at the Pons Sublicius. The pontiffs and the magistrates were carrying straw effigies of bound men, also called Argei, which the Vestals threw into the Tiber. The Flaminica Dialis was dressed in mourning. The ceremony has sometimes been interpreted as an Etruscan magical military tactic, comparable to another in which a Gallic man and woman were buried alive in the Forum Boarium. The Greeks and the Gauls were being ritually buried or drowned, which the superstitious Romans believed had a real effect on their Greek or Gallic enemies. They carried out this type of sacrifice also after major defeats.  New developments  The publication Papers of the British School at Rome, volume 72, 2004, contains an article by Pier Luigi Tucci, \\"Eight Fragments of the Marble Plan of Rome Shedding New Light on the Transtiberim\\", where he claims that fragments 138a‚Äìf and 574a‚Äìb of the Forma Urbis, a marble plan of Rome from the time of Septimius Severus, show the right bank of the Tiber, opposite the Aventine. A road appears there, formerly thought to cross the Pons Aemilius, but shown on the forma crossing another bridge, the last remains of which were removed in the late nineteenth century. This bridge is thought to have been the pons Sublicius.

History of the Byzantine State, p. 551. Published by Rutgers University Press, 1969. . The Wallachian army led by Voivod Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n (Mircea the Elder) opposed the Ottoman invasion personally led by Sultan Bayezid I the Lightning. The Turkish force heavily outnumbered the Wallachian troops. The legend says that on the eve of the battle, dressed as a peace emissary, Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n talked to Bayezid asking him to leave Wallachia and promising him safe passage back. The Sultan proudly insisted on fighting.  Battle  The battle took place probably near the Arge»ô River, but the exact location is disputed. The Wallachian victory is confirmed by numerous sources and historians. During the battle, a key tactical role was played by the Wallachian archers who severely depleted the Ottoman ranks during their initial attack.Cronica bulgarƒÉ la I. Bogdan, Ein Beitrag zur bulgarischen und serbischen Geschichtschreibung, √Æn Archiv f√ºr slavische Philologie, p. 530. The historical sources mention that the sun was blocked out by the vast number of arrows. Bayezid's vassals, the Serbian lords Stefan Lazareviƒá and Marko Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, two of the greatest knights of the time, participated and fought bravely; Stefan showed great courage, Marko was killed in action. An alternative historical view is that the dramatic confrontation lasted not just a single day, but an entire week, being in the first stage a war of positions. The fierce battle ended with heavy casualties for both sides, eventually each army withdrawing from the battlefield. Although Wallachians pushed back the enemy, the Ottomans were able to defend their resulting position relying on the personal guard of the Sultan composed of Janissaries. This was the impregnable position of the Ottoman defense a year later, in the famous Battle of Nicopolis. This tactical innovation became a fundamental element of the Ottoman war strategies until the 18th century. The army of Mircea, sustaining heavy casualties, and unable to break the defense of the Sultan's camp, was finally obliged to withdraw. Because the Ottoman Empire was not able to conquer Wallachia at this time, Rovine remains one of the most important battles in Romanian history. An epic description of the confrontation is presented in the poem \\"Scrisoarea a III-a\\" (The Third Letter) written by the Romanian national poet, Mihai Eminescu. The Deƒçani chronicle describes the battle and reports that Prince Marko and Constantine Draga≈° died fighting. The same source mentions that Marko's brother, Andreja Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, also perished during the fight.Successors of the Mrnjavƒçeviƒá family and theritories under their power 1371‚Äì1459, University of Belgrade, Faculty of Philosophy, PhD thesis of Aleksiƒá Vladimir (2012), p. 147.

Researchers observed that when the goat propelled itself forward, it extended its back legs and the front legs were tucked close up to its chest during its first phase. During the second phase the goat raised its back legs near to its chest, while the front legs humerus stayed locked in a persistent location relative to the goat's chest, therefore allowing the elbow to be detained in close proximity to the whole body's center of balance. Extension of the elbow and carpal joints resulted in a vertical translation of the center of mass up the mountain slope.

He played for the Cyprus national football team, and he is the all- time leading scorer with 32 goals in 85 appearances. He also played for Iraklis, Panathinaikos and Olympiacos in Greece. Club career =Early= Born in Paralimni, he got his start in professional football playing for hometown side Enosis Neon Paralimni, for whom he scored 17 goals in 25 games in the 1996/97 season and became top goal scorer of Cypriot Championship. =Iraklis Thessaloniki= Picked up by Iraklis Thessaloniki in Greece in 1997, his four seasons produced a total of 61 goals in 119 appearances as he also played in the UEFA Cup. =Panathinaikos= In 2001, in a deal which took three Panathinaikos players to Iraklis, Konstantinou transferred to Panathinaikos for ‚Ç¨15 million. It was a successful purchase, but many believed that the young Cypriot striker was worth less than the expenditure of ‚Ç¨15 million made by Panathinaikos ‚Äì the highest figure ever paid for a player in the Greek Superleague. With Panathinaikos, he had the opportunity to play in the Champions League, earning praise for his performances in attack. There he found with the Portuguese players Paulo Sousa and later Robert Jarni, taking Panathinakos a long way in the competition. He scored a beautiful 45m goal in the Nou Camp return in the quarter-final against Barcelona in the Champions 2001/02. Panathinaikos seemed to ensure its marking the semi-finals, as they were needed 3 goals to go to the Spaniards. Bar√ßa, however, came back and won 3‚Äì1, qualifying for the semi-finals. In 2004/05 he had 15 goals. Konstantinou scored against the champions in a 1‚Äì0 home win, at the end of the season Konstantinou did not renew with Panathinaikos, because he stated that he was going to continue his footballing career in a league of higher value to gain better experience. That summer though, he was not signed by a club overseas and was signed by Olympiacos. =Olympiakos= As an Olympiacos player he won with his team the double for 2005/06 and made it two in his career. At the Greek Cup final in 2005/06, where Olympiacos beat AEK Athens 3‚Äì0, Konstantinou scored Olympiacos' first goal. He also notably scored a late strike to make it 1‚Äì2 in the early season league victory of Olympiacos against AEK Athens (final score 1‚Äì3) and a crowd-pleaser against his former team, Panathinaikos, to make it 3‚Äì1 (match ended 3‚Äì2). He became for the second consecutive time champion again with Olympiakos in 2007, even though the season was full of personal injuries and bad luck, he still managed to perform well on some important matches, most notably scoring on the away Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk. During the 2007‚Äì2008 season, he has suffered from injuries and has lost his starting position to Darko Kovacevic. It was the last season at Olympiakos. =Iraklis Thessaloniki= Konstantinou started the 2008‚Äì09 season in Greece at Iraklis where he started his career in Greece in 1997. He spent some seasons at Iraklis before going to Panathinaikos back in 1997. Here he played 13 matches of which he scored three goals. =Omonoia Nicosia= Halfway through the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Konstantinou was transferred to Cyprus to play for Omonia. During the 2009‚Äì2010 season, he scored several goals for the club, including in derbies against rivals APOEL, Anorthosis, and Apollon. After taking a leadership and mentor role with the team in his first full season in 2010, Konstantinou helped Omonoia to win its 20th Cypriot Championship and in the club he found his couch Takis Lemonis that was also his coach in Olympiacos. =Anorthosis Famagusta= In Summer 2011, Konstantinou signed a contract with Anorthosis Famagusta. =AEL Limasssol= In Summer 2012, Konstantinou signed a one-year contract with AEL Limassol. =Retirement= In January 2014, he announced his retirement from football as a player. International career He made his international debut against Albania in August 1998 and subsequently averaged almost a goal every other game in his first 35 caps. His first two goals came 10 February 1999 against San Marino at Tsirion Stadium (final score 4‚Äì0). =International goals= Honours Panathinaikos *Greek Championship: 2004 *Greek Cup: 2004 Olympiacos *Greek Championship: 2006, 2007, 2008 *Greek Cup: 2006, 2008 *Greek Super Cup: 2007 Omonia *Cypriot Championship: 2010 *Cypriot Cup: 2011 *Cypriot Super Cup: 2010 Individual *Cypriot First Division ‚Äì Top Scorer: 1996‚Äì97 ‚Äì Paralimni *Greek Cup: 2004 ‚Äì MVP *Greek Cup: 2006 ‚Äì MVP References External links * UEFA.com biography Michalis Konstandinou ‚Äì Goals in International Matches Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Cypriot footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Cyprus international footballers Category:Greek Cypriot people Category:Enosis Neon Paralimni FC players Category:Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. players Category:Panathinaikos F.C. players Category:Olympiacos F.C. players Category:AC Omonia players Category:Anorthosis Famagusta FC players Category:AEL Limassol players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:Cypriot expatriate footballers ","title":"Michalis Konstantinou"},{"id":"1914811","text":"The R√≠o Grande is a river in the province of Lugo, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain.

At a time when few women were financially self-sufficient, Kerr made her way from Maryland‚Äôs Eastern Shore to New York City, where she supported herself as a magazine editor and a writer of more than 500 short stories, 23 novels, several poems and a play that ran on Broadway. Her bequest to Washington College on Maryland‚Äôs Eastern Shore in 1965 stipulated that the proceeds of the $578,000 endowment be used to fund an annual literary prize and to support literary events and scholarships at the college. Since 1968, the college in Chestertown has awarded more than $1.4 million in prize money to promising young writers and has enabled Washington College to bring a succession of the nation‚Äôs literary luminaries to the small liberal arts college located just 30 miles from where she grew up. The childhood home of Sophie Kerr, a circa 1860 farmhouse on the corner of 5th and Kerr Avenues in Denton, Maryland, still stands. She specifically describes the house in her short story, ‚ÄúComing Home for Christmas.‚Äù Life and career Born in the Caroline County town of Denton, Maryland, in 1880, Sophie Kerr graduated from Denton High School in 1895 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Hood College and a master's degree from the University of Vermont. She married John DeLoss Underwood, a civil engineer, in 1904 and divorced him four years later. In order to support herself, Kerr went into journalism, launching her career in Pittsburgh, Pa. as the women‚Äôs page editor at the Chronicle Telegraph and the Pittsburgh Gazette. Moving to New York, she became managing editor of The Woman's Home Companion.New International Encyclopedia and published her fiction in other popular magazines of the day, including Saturday Evening Post, Collier‚Äôs Saturday Review of Literature and McCalls. From 1920 until her death in 1965 at age 84, Kerr lived in a brownstone residence at 115 East 38th Street, where she created something of a literary salon for her friends in publishing and theater. In 1942, as part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of co-education at Washington College, she accepted an honorary degree along with Eleanor Roosevelt.http://www.kentcountyhistory.org/key/victorian.php While her fiction is largely unknown to contemporary readers and her books are long out of print, her stories dealt with class and gender issues at work in the first half of the 20th century. ‚ÄúKerr wrote stories about plucky heroines, young women who rose to the challenge and went for the gusto. They had big dreams and lots of charm and tons of blond curls. For the most part, they were smart and unassuming and hopelessly, wonderfully, kind, but they had ambition. Even her seemingly vapid heroines had hearts of gold and wills of iron hidden under all their finery.‚Äù In her will, she left the bulk of her estate to Washington College, with the stipulation that half its income would be awarded annually to the senior showing ‚Äúthe most ability and promise for future fulfillment in the field of literary endeavor.‚Äù The other half funds scholarships, student publications and a series of visits by renowned writers. The Sophie Kerr Prize The Sophie Kerr Prize is awarded each year to a graduating senior at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland who has demonstrated the best ability and promise for future fulfillment in the field of literary endeavor. The prize is announced in New York City. Valued at $65,768 in 2016, it is the nation's largest undergraduate literary prize.Sophie Kerr Prize homepage Indeed, it is among the largest in the world, exceeding the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, and National Book Critics Circle. Applicants submit portfolios of what they deem to be their best writing, which may include critical essays, creative nonfiction, poetry, fiction, journalism, stage plays, screenplays, blogging, graphic novels, or other hybrid forms. In a typical year, between 20 and 30 seniors submit portfolios for consideration. In the past, the prize has been awarded for both creative and critical writing. The 2011 Sophie Kerr Prize was awarded to Lisa Jones, an anthropology major who wrote about her life-changing trip to Tanzania. In a break from tradition, Washington College announced the winner at the Poets House in New York City where Sophie Kerr lived for more than 40 years. The first Sophie Kerr Prize, valued at $9,000, was awarded to a Washington College senior in 1968. The exact value varies according to the return on the endowment. Since its inception, the Sophie Kerr Endowment has provided more than $1.4 million in prize money to promising young writers and has brought literary stars such as Toni Morrison, Katherine Ann Porter, Edward Albee, Natasha Trethewey, and Colum McCann to the Washington College campus.

Biography Born in Paris, he studied at the √âcole Gratuite de Dessin in Paris and then in the studio of Charles- Antoine BridanCharles Paul Landon, Annales du Mus√©e et de l'√âcole Moderne des Beaux-Arts vol. I, 1833:27ff. before attending the Acad√©mie Royale. During the French Revolution Cartellier was part of a team of sculptors who worked on the church of Ste. Genevi√®ve in Paris to convert it to the Panth√©on. At a time in European history when ancient works were the measure by which all statuary was judged, in 1801 Cartellier obtained wide recognition after exhibiting a plaster version of his statue of Modesty that was based on the free-standing statue of the Capitoline Venus in Rome. At the Bourbon Restoration he was given the commission to do the bronze equestrian statue of King Louis XIV that can be seen in the cour d'honneur of Versailles. At the time of his death only the horse had been cast. His son-in-law Louis Petitot completed it with the king's figure. Cartellier sculpted the model for the bronze statue of Dominique Vivant, baron Denon (1747‚Äì1825), that adorns his tomb at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. However, Cartellier's best known work came in 1825 when he was commissioned by Vivant's close friends Eug√®ne and Hortense de Beauharnais who wanted him to sculpt a monument for the tomb of their mother, the Empress Jos√©phine. Cartellier's statue, modeled from Josephine's kneeling image in the painting of the coronation of Napol√©on Bonaparte by Jacques-Louis David, can be seen at the Church of Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul in Rueil- Malmaison. Cartellier was made a member of Institut de France, of the Legion of Honor (1808) and decorated with the Order of St-Michel (1824). He was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1808. He taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His daughter married the painter Jean-Fran√ßois Heim but she died at the age of nineteen. Pierre Cartellier died in Paris in 1831 and was interred there in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery with his wife and daughter. Principal works The following were singled out by Landon 1833: *Aristide, placed in the Chambre des Pairs. Aristides was an Athenian soldier and statesman. *Jeunes filles de Sparte dansant autour du statue de Diane (\\"Young girls of Sparta dancing before the altar of Diana\\"), bas-relief for the Salle de Diane, in the Napoleonic Mus√©e des Antiques established in the Palais du Louvre; in situ. *La Gloire distribuant des couronnes (\\"Fame distributing crowns\\"), bas-relief for the colonnade of the Louvre; in situ. *Capitulation d'Ulm, bas-relief for the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel erected in front of the Tuileries; in situ. *General Valhubert, for the Pont de la Concorde, Paris, 1815; in the Jardin de l'Evech√©, Avranches, Normandy) (illustration, above right) *Minerve, frappant la terre (\\"Minerva striking the earth to generate the olive tree\\"), Versailles. *Louis XIV, equestrian bas-relief for the H√¥tel des Invalides. *Empress Josephine, church at Rueil-Malmaison, near Paris. *Two monuments to Louis XV, in bronze, one for the Place de Reims, the other for the Rond Point of the Champs-√âlys√©es. *La Pudeur (\\"Modesty\\"); exhibited at the Salon of 1801, in plaster, when it won a first prize, and of 1808, in marble, which was purchased for the gallery at Malmaison.

Dobson began as a painter, and his early work was influenced by cubism, vorticism, and futurism. After World War I, however, he turned increasingly toward sculpture in a more or less realist style. Throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s he built a reputation as an outstanding sculptor and was among the first in Britain to prefer direct carving of the material rather than modelling a maquette first. The simplified forms and flowing lines of much of his sculptures, particularly his female nudes, showed the influence of African art. From 1946 to 1953 Dobson was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1953. While Dobson was one of the most esteemed artists of his time, after his death his reputation declined with the move towards postmodernism and conceptual art. However, in recent years a revival has begun. Dobson is now seen as one of the most important British sculptors of the 20th century. Early life Dobson was born in central London and grew up in Clerkenwell. His mother was Alice Mary Owen and his father, who was also named Frank Dobson, was a commercial artist who specialized in bird and flower designs for greeting card companies. The younger Dobson attended school in Forest Gate and then in Harrow. When his father died in 1900, the fourteen year old Dobson was sent to live with an aunt in Hastings. There he attended evening classes at the Hastings School of Art and was then trained as an apprentice with Sir William Reynolds-Stephens. After eighteen months in Reynolds-Stephen's studio, Dobson moved to Devon and then to Cornwall where he lived, for two years, by selling landscape paintings. In 1906 he obtained a scholarship to study at the art institute in Hospitalfield House in Arbroath and studied there for four years. From 1910 to 1912 Dobson attended the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, after which he returned to Cornwall. In Newlyn, he met Augustus John who used his influence and contacts to enable Dobson to stage a one-man show at the Chenil Gallery in London in 1914. In, or around, 1915 Dobson created his first sculpture, a small piece in wood. World War One The Balloon Apron (1918) (Art.IWM ART2001) In 1915, during the First World War, Dobson enlisted in The Artists Rifles and served in France from October 1916 as a Lieutenant with the 5th Border Regiment. In January 1917 he developed a duodenal ulcer and returned to England. In April 1918 he married Cordelia Clara Tregurtha, whom he had first met in Newlyn. Dobson was formally invalided out of the Army in November 1918 and by then had already submitted several drawings to the British War Memorials Committee and was commissioned to paint a barrage balloon site on the Thames estuary. The Air Force representatives on the Committee did not approve of the picture and Dobson did not receive any further official commissions. Dobson set up a studio in the Tregurtha family home in Newlyn but towards the end of the war he took a studio in Manresa Road in Chelsea and would live there until the start of the Second World War. Inter-war years Woman and the Fish at Delapr√© Abbey, Northampton Throughout the 1920s Dobson focused increasingly on sculpture, exhibited work in several influential exhibitions and played a leading role in a number of artistic groups. He was the only sculptor to take part in the 1920 Group X exhibition. Dobson was a founding member of the London Artists Association and spent three years as President of the London Group between 1923 and 1927. He made bronze portraits of several public figures. At the Group X exhibition he exhibited two sculptures and studies of Ben Nicholson and his bronze head of H. H. Asquith was shown at the Leicester Galleries in late 1921. Other subjects included Osbert Sitwell, Lydia Lopokova and Tallulah Bankhead. Dobson exhibited at the Venice Biennale in both 1924 and in 1926, was featured in the 1925 Tri-National Exhibition which visited London, Paris and New York and was also included in the 1926 European artists exhibition that toured America and Canada. In March 1927 he had his first major one-man exhibition when the Leicester Galleries exhibited twenty-three of his sculptures and several bronzes. In 1930 the Tate purchased a larger-than-life sculpture from Dobson and erected it outside the gallery on Millbank. During the early 1930s Dobson continued to receive portrait commissions, most notably for Sir Edward Marsh and the actress Margaret Rawlings. Dobson worked in other media including textiles and silver, as well. His silver gilt cup, Calix Majestatis, to mark the coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth is now in the Royal Collection. During 1933 Dobson fractured his left arm which greatly limited his ability for heavy carving and his last monumental stone carving was to be Pax, which was first shown at the London Group in 1935. World War Two and later An Escalator in an Underground Factory (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 4142) At the start of World War Two, Dobson and his second wife, whom he had married in 1931, moved to Bristol, where a large retrospective of his work was held in March 1940. Dobson lived in the city throughout the Bristol Blitz and like several other artists painted the ruins of churches destroyed in the bombing. Dobson contacted the War Artists' Advisory Committee and offered his services as both a painter and sculptor. WAAC were reluctant to offer sculpture commissions but eventually did offer Dobson a short-term contract for two portrait busts of Naval personal. Later WAAC commissioned some paintings, including one of workers arriving for work at a factory that had been relocated to a tunnel. Dobson was appointed head of sculpture at the Royal College of Art in 1946, a post he held until his retirement in 1953. For the Festival of Britain site on the South Bank of the Thames in 1951, Dobson created London Pride. The sculpture was originally exhibited as a plaster cast but was later, after Dobson died, cast as a bronze and placed in front of the Royal National Theatre in 1987. Among his last commissions were a bronze head of Sir Thomas Lipton and the zodiac clock on the exterior wall of Bracken House in London. Legacy London Pride outside the National Theatre, London Frank Dobson blue plaque at 14 Harley Gardens, Chelsea, London Dobson died in 1963 and his ashes were scattered in the Thames. In 1995 the art critic Brian Sewell recalled the great loss of much of Dobson's work after his death: \\"After his death, his widow asked me to help her clear the studio at Stamford Bridge, and I was appalled at the destruction that she wrought, smashing to smithereens small clay and terracotta models, tearing fine drawings in red and black chalk, hundreds of them, the fragments in a dustbin, all because the subjects were erotic. I was allowed to save pastel drawings of exotic and rare birds, and watercolours of farmyards and a pastoral life long gone, but for the figures engaged in sexual congress, face to face, head to toe and doggy style as explicit as any by his old friend Eric Gill, Mrs Dobson would accept no plea that they were beautiful, no argument that they were fired by a quality not to be found in the ‚Äúpure essence‚Äù of the torsos that survive, and like a ferociously implacable angel at the Last Judgment, she bent to the business of destruction.\\" Frank Dobson Square was constructed by London County Council in 1963, the year of Dobson's death to commemorate his life and work. The centrepiece of the square was the Woman and Fish fountain, a sculpture designed and completed by Dobson in 1951.

It continues the story some two years after the point where The Well of Lost Plots leaves off. Plot introduction The book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in The Eyre Affair; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot. The title is taken from Hamlet I.iv: \\"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\\". Plot summary The story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old. Thursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \\"Outland\\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time- travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them. Despite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \\"The Windowmaker\\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike. Thursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \\"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \\"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday. Goliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO‚Äîat their headquarters in the Isle of Man‚Äîand gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \\"stick\\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly. On top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy). She succeeds but not without a near- death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.

They were the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald, acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (MacDonald's husband), MacDonald's sister Frances and Herbert MacNair. Together, The Four defined the Glasgow Style's fusion of influences including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe. The Four, otherwise known as the Spook School, ultimately made a significant impact on the definition of Art Nouveau. The name, Spook School, or Spooky or Ghoul School, was originally a \\"derisive epithet\\" given to their work which \\"distorted and conventionalized human... form.\\" The Glasgow Girls The Glasgow Girls is the name now used for a group of female designers and artists including Margaret and Frances MacDonald, both of whom were members of The Four, Jessie M. King, Annie French, Helen Paxton Brown, Jessie Wylie Newbery, Ann Macbeth, Bessie MacNicol, Norah Neilson Gray,Glasgow Girls On Display, Mary Selwood, accessed July 2010 Stansmore Dean, Eleanor Allen Moore, De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar, the silversmith Agnes Banks Harvey and Christian Jane Fergusson. May Wilson and Eliza Bell, among others, continued the tradition of ceramic artistry into the 1940s and 1950s by hand painting various items with floral patterns. Women were able to flourish in Glasgow during a \\"period of enlightenment\\" that took place between 1885 and 1920, where women were actively pursuing art careers and the Glasgow School of Art had a significant period of \\"international visibility\\". This is sometimes attributed to the \\"influential\\" and \\"progressive\\" head of the art school, Fra Newbery, who established an environment in which women could flourish, both as students and as teachers. Women benefited from the new Glasgow Society of Lady Artists (founded 1882) which offered a place for women artists to meet and also had exhibition space. In addition, many art school students and staff were involved in women's suffrage. \\"Students took turns between classes stitching up banners\\" for the movement. thumb The name \\"Glasgow Girls\\" emerged much later. In the 1960s there was an attempt to give due attention to the work of the city‚Äôs women artists to balance the plentiful discussion of the Glasgow Boys. It is thought that the then head of the Scottish Arts Council William Buchanan was the first to use the name in the catalogue for a 1968 Glasgow Boys exhibition.The Glasgow Boys: An Exhibition of Work by the Group of Artists who Flourished in Glasgow 1880-1900, Volume 2, Scottish Arts Council, 1968 This \\"invention\\"Andrew Gibbbon Williams, 'Engendering respect', The Times (features), 18 Sep 1990 has been called an \\"ironic reference\\" to the equivalent men‚Äôs grouping. The term Glasgow Girls was emphasised by a major exhibition Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920 organised by Jude Burkhauser in 1990.

Their subject matter featured rural, prosaic scenes from in and around Glasgow. Their colorful depictions attempted to capture the many facets of the character of Scotland. The Glasgow Boys consisted of several men, most of whom were trained in, or had strong ties to the city of Glasgow. These men were brought together by a passion for realism and naturalism and this showed through in the pieces they produced. Along with this passion for naturalism, they shared a marked distaste for the Edinburgh oriented Scottish art establishment, which they viewed as oppressive. Driven and motivated by these ideals they embraced change, created masterpieces, and became Scottish icons in the process. There were three distinct waves of Glasgow Boys. The leading figures of the first wave were James Paterson (1854‚Äì1932) and William York Macgregor (1855-1923), and the group used to meet at Macgregor's studio. The second wave was represented in Joseph Crawhall (1861‚Äì1913), Thomas Millie Dow (1848-1919), James Guthrie (1859‚Äì1930), George Henry (1858‚Äì1943), E. A. Hornel (1864‚Äì1933), James Whitelaw Hamilton (1860-1932) and E. A. Walton (1860‚Äì1922). The third wave of artists were David Gauld (1865‚Äì1936), William Kennedy (1859‚Äì1918), John Lavery (1856‚Äì1941), Harrington Mann (1864-1937), Stuart Park (1862‚Äì1933), William Wells (1872‚Äì1923), David Young Cameron (1865‚Äì1945), Alexander Ignatius Roche (1861‚Äì1923), Arthur Melville (1855‚Äì1904), Thomas Corsan Morton (1859-1928), James Nairn (1859‚Äì1904), George Pirie (1863-1946) and John Quinton Pringle (1864‚Äì1925). Their main influences were that of Japanese print, French Realism including Jules Bastien-Lepage, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, but all of their experiences around the world greatly impacted on and inspired their work, in particular in Spain, North Africa, and Japan. The group was constantly influenced by what they saw in the world around them and strove to display these images by utilizing the techniques of realism and naturalism; they had a passion to depict things as they actually are. This is one of the reasons that the group often chose to work outdoors. Working outdoors allowed them to produce paintings that were as true to nature as possible and it allowed them to paint realistic objects in their natural environment. They painted real people in real places. The production of naturalistic paintings was new to this time period, and thus their techniques were considered to be innovative. Similarly, the pieces often created a sense of movement, an accurate (or naturalistic) depiction of light and shade, and extremely realistic texture. This made them stand out in the art community.

Instead, the natural odor is transcribed into what is most often described as an unpleasant aroma, typically a \\"'burned,' 'rotting,' 'fecal,' or 'chemical' smell\\". The term is from the Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨ par√° and ·ΩÄœÉŒºŒÆ osm·∏ó. There are rare instances, however, of pleasant odors; this is more specifically called euosmia (Greek). Causes There are numerous diseases that parosmia is associated with. In the case study cited above, Frasnelli et al. examined five patients that endured parosmia or phantosmia, most as a result of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). It is hypothesized that URTIs can result in parosmia because of damage to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The condition has been linked to coronavirus disease 2019 as a rare side effect. Exposure to harmful solvents has also been linked to parosmia and more specifically damaging ORNs. Damage to these neurons could end in the inability to correctly encode a signal representing a particular odor, which would send an erroneous signal to the odor processing center, the olfactory bulb. This, in turn, leads to the signal activating a different trigger, i.e. a different smell, than the stimulating odor, and thus the patient cannot sync the input and output odors. Damage to ORNs describes a peripheral defect in the pathway, but there are also instances where damage to the processing center in the brain can lead to distorted odors as well. Different types of head trauma could also lead to dysfunctions that relate to what the afflicted brain area controls. In humans, the olfactory bulb is located on the inferior side of the brain. Physical damage to this area would alter how the area processes information in a variety of ways, but there are also other types of diseases that can alter how this area works. If the part of the brain that interprets these input signals is damaged, then a distorted output is possible. This would also lead to parosmia. Temporal lobe epilepsy has also led to cases of parosmia, but these were only temporary; the onset of parosmia was a seizure and it typically lasted a week or two after. Parosmia is also a known symptom for Parkinson's disease, though not ubiquitous for patients with it, and although the specific pathway is undetermined, the lack of dopamine has resulted in documented cases of parosmia and phantosmia. Diagnosing One method used to establish parosmia is the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, or UPSIT. \\"Sniffin' Sticks\\" are another method that can be used to properly diagnose parosmia. These different techniques can also help deduce whether a specific case of parosmia can be attributed to just one stimulating odor or if there is a group of stimulating odors that will generate the displaced smell. One case study performed by Frasnelli et al. offers a situation where certain smells, specifically coffees, cigarettes, onions, and perfumes, induced a \\"nauseating\\" odor for the patient, one which was artificial but unable to be aptly related to another known smell. In another case study cited in the same paper, one woman had parosmia in one nostril but not the other. Medical examinations and MRIs did not reveal any abnormalities; however the parosmia in this case was degenerative and only got worse with time. The authors do comment, however, that cases of parosmia can predict regeneration of olfactory senses. Treatment For most patients afflicted with parosmia, symptoms usually decrease with time. Although there are instances of parosmia affecting patients for years at a time, this is certainly not the majority of cases. There have been experiments done to treat parosmia with L-Dopa, but besides that there are no current treatments other than inducing anosmia or hyposmia to the point where the odors are negligible.

While they appear similar to the treecreepers (Certhia), they do not use their tails to support them while climbing and some molecular evidence shows them to be closer to the nuthatches (Sitta) while another study suggests a closer relation to the wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria.

The material was recorded, translated, and reworked by the exciseman and folklorist Alexander Carmichael (1832-1912). Authors and Publication Carmina Gadelica was published in six volumes: Alexander Carmichael himself, with the assistance of family and friends, was responsible for the first two volumes, published in 1900; these were re-edited by his daughter Ella (1870-1928) in 1928. Although Carmichael's correspondence suggests that he planned at least one further volume in the series, he was unable to bring this plan to fruition. Further selections from Carmichael's manuscripts were edited by his grandson James Carmichael Watson (1910-1942) and published as volumes III (1940) and IV (1941). A fifth volume, mostly taken up with song texts, was edited by Professor Angus Matheson (1912-1962) in 1954. The series was rounded off in 1971 with a sixth volume containing a lengthy glossary and indices, edited by Angus Matheson with the assistance of his brother William (1910-1995).Sti√πbhart, Domhnall Uilleam. \\"Alexander Carmichael and Carmina Gadelica\\" in idem (ed.), The Life and Legacy of Alexander Carmichael (Port of Ness, Lewis, 2008), p. 32. In 1992 Floris Press published a one-volume English-language edition with a valuable introduction by Dr John MacInnes (b. 1930).Carmichael, Alexander (ed.), Carmina Gadelica: Hymns and Incantations (Edinburgh, 1992). Floris would reprint the entire six- volume series in 2006.Carmichael, Alexander (ed.), Ortha nan G√†idheal: Carmina Gadelica (6 vols, Edinburgh, 2006). Origins of the collection The origins of the Carmina Gadelica can be traced to ‚ÄòGrazing and Agrestic Customs of the Outer Hebrides‚Äô, the second appendix Alexander Carmichael contributed to the Report of the Napier Commission in 1884.Carmichael, Alexander. \\"Grazing and agrestic customs of the Outer Hebrides\\", Report of Her Majesty‚Äôs Commissioners of Inquiry into the Conditions of the Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1884), pp. 451‚Äì82. Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier, had requested Carmichael to compose a piece on traditional Hebridean land customs based on the chapter on the subject that he had written for the third volume of William Forbes Skene‚Äôs Celtic Scotland.Skene, William Forbes. Celtic Scotland (3 vols, Edinburgh, 1876‚Äì80), vol. iii, pp. 378‚Äì93. Carmichael rounded off his contribution in an unorthodox manner, presenting a selection of traditional rhymes, prayers, blessings, and songs he had gathered from a wide variety of informants in the islands, intended to illustrate the spiritual refinement and respectability of their crofter reciters. The popularity of ‚ÄòGrazing and Agrestic Customs‚Äô, and a subsequent paper Carmichael delivered on 24 December 1888 to the Gaelic Society of Glasgow on ‚ÄòUist Old Hymns‚Äô, encouraged him to embark upon a much more comprehensive work on the subject.Carmichael, Alexander. \\"Uist old hymns\\", Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Glasgow, i, 34‚Äì47. Publishers The collection was first offered, in 1891, to the Clarendon Press as Idylls of the Isles, then subsequently to Archibald Sinclair's Gaelic publishing company in Glasgow. In both cases, the offer was withdrawn owing to Carmichael's unhappiness with the publisher's plans, and his determination to see the collection through the press on his own terms and according to his own design. Much of the final editing was carried out after Carmichael's retiral from the Inland Revenue in December 1897, with the help of a team of assistants including his daughter Ella Carmichael and his prot√©g√©s George Henderson (1866-1912), who gave the work its title, and Kenneth MacLeod (1871-1955). The initial letters, adapted from early medieval insular manuscripts and engraved stones, were illustrated by Carmichael's wife Mary Frances Macbean (1838-1928). The book itself, dedicated to Mary Frances, was published in two volumes in October 1900, under the auspices of Walter Biggar Blaikie (1847-1928) in a limited edition of 300 copies, costing 3 guineas a copy. Carmina Gadelica was a landmark in Scottish art publishing, intended not just as a treasury of lore, but as an object of beauty in itself.Campbell, John Lorne. \\"Carmina Gadelica: George Henderson‚Äôs corrections and suggestions\\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xiii(2) (1981), pp. 183‚Äì216; Sti√πbhart, \\"Alexander Carmichael and Carmina Gadelica\\", pp. 21‚Äì2; Sugg, Laura. \\"The experience of God in everyday life in Alexander Carmichael‚Äôs Carmina Gadelica\\" (University of Edinburgh, unpublished Ph.D. thesis, 1997), pp. 53‚Äì8, 275‚Äì87. Reviews The first two volumes of Carmina Gadelica were initially welcomed by reviewers as a monumental achievement in folklore, as well as a lasting testament to their creator: the ‚Äòsplendid consummation of the love-labour of a whole diligent life-time‚Äô.Dr H. C. Gillies, review of Carmina Gadelica, Highland News, 8 Dec 1901. Although little public criticism was voiced during Carmichael's lifetime, it is clear that other Gaelic folklore collectors and scholars such as Father Allan McDonald, the Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, and Alexander Macbain were uneasy with his earlier treatment of material he had collected.Sti√πbhart, \\"Alexander Carmichael and Carmina Gadelica\\", p. 30. Eventually, Carmichael's editing methods were roundly challenged in 1976 with the publication of Hamish Robertson's article in Scottish Gaelic Studies, \\"Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\\". Having searched for manuscript copies of charms appearing in the third and fourth volumes, Robertson accused Carmichael of meddling with, altering, and polishing original texts: 'hardly one had not been touched up in some way, sometimes quite drastically'.Robertson, Hamish. \\"Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xii(2) (1976), p. 231. Robertson's article drew a vigorous rebuff from the Gaelic scholar John Lorne Campbell in the following issue of the journal, although Campbell conceded that '[m]uch of the first three volumes of the Carmina must be taken as a literary and not as a literal presentation of Gaelic folklore'.Campbell, John Lorne. \\"Notes on Hamish Robertson's Studies in Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica\\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xiii(1) (1978), p. 13. Now that Alexander Carmichael's original field notebooks, accompanied by full transcriptions, have been published online under the auspices of the Carmichael Watson Project at the Centre for Research Collections, University of Edinburgh, for the first time the editing processes involved in the creation of Carmina Gadelica can properly be assessed. Legacy Although Carmina Gadelica remains a controversial text, its volumes have to be read in the context of Carmichael's own times, a period of widespread political strife in the Highlands, when habitual contempt of Gaels, their language and their culture was widespread and publicly expressed. In the words of Gaelic scholar Dr John MacInnes, Carmina Gadelica is not a monumental exercise in literary fabrication nor, on the other hand, is it a transcript of ancient poems and spells reproduced exactly in the form in which they survived in oral tradition.'MacInnes, John. D√πthchas nan G√†idheal: Collected Essays of John MacInnes (Edinburgh, 2006), p. 491. Despite its flaws, Carmina Gadelica remains an indispensable source for the popular culture, customs, beliefs, and way of life of Scottish Gaels in the nineteenth century.

The original Blonds were Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown, who used the name in the 1970s. Rip Rogers and Ted Oates wrestled as The Hollywood Blonds in the mid-1980s in the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). The name was also adopted by \\"Pretty Boy\\" Larry Sharpe and \\"Dynamite\\" Jack Evans, who had a stint in then World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The most well-known team to use the \\"Hollywood Blonds\\" moniker was \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin and \\"Flyin\\" Brian Pillman who used the name as a heel tag team in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992 and 1993 and is often mentioned when talking about great tag teams.  Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown  The team of Buddy Roberts (billed as \\"Dale Roberts\\") and Jerry Brown were the first to adopt the name \\"The Hollywood Blonds\\" in wrestling when they began teaming together in 1970 in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Tri-State territory (NWA Tri State promoted in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi). The two quickly became one of the top heel acts in the territory with their \\"Hollywood superstar\\" arrogance and cheating ways. On May 8, 1970, the Blonds won their first title when they won a tournament to crown new NWA United States Tag Team Champions (Tri State version). Their first run with the title was short as Luke Brown and Danny Hodge defeated them three weeks later, but the Blonds managed to regain the gold days after being defeated by them. For the rest of 1970, Roberts and Brown dominated the Tri State tag team scene until losing to Bill Watts and Billy Red Lyons in January 1971. In early 1973, the Blonds became three-time NWA United States Tag Team Champions by defeating Dennis Stamp and Bull Bullinski for the titles. The Blonds held on to the titles until sometime in April, when they lost the gold to Rip Tyler and Eddie Sullivan before leaving the promotion by mid-1973. After leaving the Tri State area, Roberts and Brown next popped up in Florida working for Eddie Graham‚Äôs Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). After working their way up the ranks, the duo challenged for and won the top tag team title in the promotion, the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, from the team of Dick Slater and Stan Vachon in March 1974. The Blonds ruled the tag team division over the summer of 1974 until dropping the gold to Dick Slater and Toru Tanaka in the fall (either September or October). After their run with the titles ended, the Blonds moved on to another territory, the most natural territory for the team ‚Äì NWA Hollywood Wrestling in Los Angeles. The Gene and Mike LeBell territory saw Roberts and Brown win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship four times between December 1974 and August 1975, defeating such teams as Victor Rivera and Louie Tillet, Porkchop Cash and S.D. Jones, John Tolos and Louis Tillet, and the promotion's biggest tag-team attraction Black Gorman and Goliath. During their time in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Blonds were also involved in an angle that saw the Los Angeles version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship shift over to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) as their main tag team title of that day. On August 1, 1975, reigning champions Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi fought the Hollywood Blonds to a no contest, after which the titles were declared vacant. A rematch in Nagoya, Japan saw the Blonds win the North American Tag Team titles on September 22. On October 2, Inoki and Sakaguchi regained the titles and they became more or less exclusive to NJPW after that date. When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended near the end of 1975, they returned to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds‚Äô time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid- Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks right off the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25. The Blonds lost the titles to Norvell Austin and Pat Barrett on August 15. After holding the titles two more times, the team lost them for good to Austin and Barrett on September 25, 1977. Shortly after losing the Southern Tag Team titles, Brown and Roberts split up, with Roberts going on to form The Fabulous Freebirds with Terry Gordy and Michael Hayes while Brown kept working as a singles wrestler mainly in the south.  Rip Rogers and Ted Oates  In 1984, Rip Rogers and Ted Oates adopted the Hollywood Blonds moniker and \\"Superstar\\" gimmick for a run in the NWA's Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory. Rogers had previously teamed up with Gary Royal and Pez Whatley in a Hollywood Blonds inspired team known as The Convertible Blondes in Angelo Poffo's International Championship Wrestling (ICW). The arrogant heel team defeated Ron Garvin and Oates' storyline brother, Jerry, to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship on September 20, 1984. Rogers and Oates held on to the titles for a little over a month. They lost the titles to The Lightning Express (Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner) on November 1. Not long after losing the titles, Rogers and Oates split up when Rip Rogers left the area to pursue a singles career.  Dusty Wolfe and Ken Timbs  From August till October 1984, Dusty Wolfe and Ken Timbs formed The Hollywood Blondes in Florida, with little success.The Hollywood Blondes (Wolfe and Timbs) from WrestlingData.com  Steve Austin and Brian Pillman  The version of The Hollywood Blonds with the greatest exposure worldwide was the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) incarnation consisting of \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin and \\"Flyin'\\" Brian Pillman. Steve Austin and Brian Pillman teamed for the first time on October 17, 1992 and battled to a draw with Shane Douglas and Brad Armstrong.Pro Wrestling illustrated, PWI 500 4th edition December 1994 issue, Steve Austin bio, p.35. Austin and Pillman also teamed against Scott Steiner and Marcus Alexander Bagwell, jobber tag team Chris Sullivan and Tommy Angel, Dustin Rhodes and Brad Armstrong (who was filling in for Barry Windham), Ricky Steamboat and Nikita Koloff, and Steamboat and Douglas. Austin and Pillman temporarily stopped teaming when in late 1992, the recently heel turned Brian Pillman started teaming with Barry Windham, but when Windham was groomed for a singles push and a run with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and after one last unsuccessful attempt at winning the WCW/NWA World Tag Team Championship from Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas at Starrcade 1992, Pillman and Windham stopped teaming. Windham declared his intention to pursue the NWA world title, and told Pillman he should instead team with Austin. However, the real reason for the team's reunion was that the WCW bookers didn't have any other immediate plans for Austin. At first, the two were just billed as \\"Stunning\\" Steve and \\"Flyin'\\" Brian, but the two (with input from Scotty \\"Flamingo\\" Levy) came up with the idea of The Hollywood Blonds, complete with matching trunks and vests. The duo was immediately thrust into a feud with Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat over the NWA and WCW World Tag Team titles, which gave the duo a chance to show off their teamwork and their trademark \\"mock filming\\" pose that they invented. After a successful move, one of the Blonds would move his hands like he was turning the handle on an old film camera. After winning a match, Pillman or Austin would arrogantly state that \\"Your brush with greatness is over\\" to further annoy the fans. On the March 27, 1993 episode of Power Hour, Austin and Pillman defeated Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas to win their only NWA/WCW World Tag Team Championship. Though Steamboat and Douglas had several rematches, they were unable to recapture the titles. On one night, Austin and Pillman faced an unknown masked team known as \\"Dos Hombres\\" (literally \\"two guys\\") who they assumed were a couple of luchadores from Mexico. The match started out rather inconspicuously, until the two masked men started showing moves more consistent with Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas than two luchadores. Dos Hombres won the match, earning them a shot at the titles at Slamboree. However, by the time Slamboree came about, Douglas had been fired by WCW and Steamboat was without a partner. Instead of canceling the already announced steel cage match, Tom Zenk was made to wear the mask of \\"Hombre Uno\\" and work the match without anyone realizing it wasn't Douglas under the red and green hood. The Blonds won at Slamboree, thus ending the \\"Dos Hombres\\" angle. After the feud with Steamboat and Douglas ended, the Blonds were programmed with the recently reformed Four Horsemen, who at the time consisted of Ric Flair, Paul Roma, and Ole and Arn Anderson. Flair had recently returned from a run with then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and been given a talk show segment called \\"A Flair for the Gold\\" to give Flair television time before his WWF release allowed him to wrestle for WCW. Pillman and Austin appeared on the show and mocked Flair and Anderson's age. Several weeks later, the Blonds continued their antagonism of Flair and Anderson by mocking them through their own segment called \\"A Flare for the Old\\". Austin would stand in the background with a pillow under his shirt for a gut while slowly stroking his chin imitating Arn Anderson. Pillman dressed up in an old bathrobe, put on reading glasses and a grey wig and then cut into Flair for being too old and too scared of the Hollywood Blonds. The impersonation drew Ric Flair back in the ring at Clash of the Champions XXIII, where Flair and Anderson challenged the Blonds for the tag team titles. Despite winning the two out of three falls match, they did not win the titles since the Blonds were disqualified after Barry Windham interfered. Windham's attack shifted Flair's focus away from the Hollywood Blonds, which in turn meant that Arn Anderson needed a new tag team partner. Not long after the Clash, Paul Roma was introduced as the fourth Horseman and would team with Anderson in the Horsemen/Blonds feud. On July 18, at Beach Blast, Roma and Anderson were beaten by the Blonds, who cheated to retain their titles. Not long after Beach Blast, Pillman injured his ankle and was unable to compete at a scheduled title match at Clash of the Champions XXIV. However, due to WCW taping policies, Arn Anderson and Paul Roma had already been taped as the World Tag Team Champions so the title change had to happen despite Pillman being injured. Austin teamed with \\"Lord\\" Steven Regal at the Clash where they dropped the titles to Roma and Anderson. As soon as the Blonds dropped the titles, the team was again temporarily split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds' last match as a team took place on the October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After the Blonds had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would put him down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and breaking up the Hollywood Blonds for the third and final time. The Austin/Pillman feud was never pushed intensely and at times played more for comedy than emotion, a fact underscored by Pillman being more interested in putting Parker in a chicken suit than getting back at Austin. They would briefly reunite in the WWF in 1996, but not as the Blonds. Austin by then was using his new \\"Stone Cold\\" persona, and an injured Pillman was \\"The Loose Cannon\\" and acted primarily as his sidekick, until Austin turned on Pillman for showing his admiration for Austin's nemesis, Bret Hart. According to WrestlingData.com, a compiler of available win-loss records, The Hollywood Blonds are perfectly balanced at 52-52, with 8 draws.Match history of The Hollywood Blonds, from WrestlingData.com In 1999, Lenny Lane and Lodi used the name The West Hollywood Blondes as a play off the old name.

History  In 1982, Italian musician Anfrando Maiola (b. 1954 in Parma, Italy) teamed up with Stefano Cundari and Alessandro Zanni and released their first single \\"Chinese Revenge\\" on Cellophane Record (Studio Veronica's label). The following year, Cundari and Zanni formed Memory Records and re-released \\"Chinese Revenge\\". The single proved to be very popular in Italy, selling over 10,000 copies. It also proved to be a minor hit in Germany and the Netherlands. After the success of \\"Chinese Revenge\\", they began writing songs for other bands, including Baby's Gang (\\"Happy Song\\", \\"Challenger\\"), and helped fellow Italian band \\"Hipnosis\\" cover Vangelis' song \\"Pulstar\\". It was released in 1983, going Top 10 in Germany and Top 20 in Switzerland. The same year, Maiola and Cundari released another single \\"Japanese War Game\\", under the Koto name, which became another hit. In 1985, Koto released \\"Visitors\\". In an interview with Maiola, he confirmed it was his favourite Koto song.Interview with Anfrando Maiola ‚Äì dragonslairfans.com Retrieved 02-10-2015 The track contains a sample from Michael Jackson's 1984 hit \\"Thriller\\". The following year, he released another single, titled \\"Jabdah\\". Fueled by a music video, the song became a big hit, charting in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Around this time, critics coined the term \\"spacesynth\\", which combines elements of Italo disco and Space disco. \\"Visitors\\" and \\"Jabdah\\" are considered part of the genre. In 1987, a megamix was released, combining elements of their previous four singles. In 1990 house and techno music was becoming popular, and Italo disco began to decline in popularity. Nevertheless, Koto released another single, \\"Dragon's Legend\\". Containing samples from the 1983 video game Dragon's Lair,Koto - Dragon's Legend ‚Äì dragonslairfans.com Retrieved 02-10-2015 the song proved a minor hit in the Netherlands, peaking at No. 20.Koto ‚Äì Dragon's Legend ‚Äì DutchCharts.nl Retrieved 02-12-2014 By now, Memory Records began running into financial problems. In 1989, they remixed their debut single, \\"Chinese Revenge\\", for a more dance flavour and Maiola composed his next single under the Koto name, the house-flavoured, \\"Champion's Cue\\". The song was not as popular as their previous singles, as Memory Records began releasing Techno and House music records. This did not prove a success, and the label went broke. The rights to Memory Records were acquired by ZYX Music. They asked Dutch composer Michiel van der Kuy (of the spacesynth band Laserdance, best known for their 1986 hit single \\"Humanoid Invasion\\") to follow the steps of Maiola and Cundari. In 1989, he presented the first full-length Koto album Masterpieces, containing remakes of previous Koto songs, and his own compositions, including \\"Time\\", \\"Minoan War\\" and \\"Plain\\". In the following years, he released more singles, including \\"Acknowledge\\" (1990), \\"Mechanic Sense\\" (1992) and \\"Mind Machine\\" (1992), the main melody of which was clearly inspired by the song \\"Disco Maniac\\" by Baby's Gang. In 1992, Michiel van der Kuy published another Koto album, From the Dawn of Time, composed entirely by himself. He also released two cover albums in 1990 and 1993. After this, Koto fell silent. During this period, it was revealed that Stefano Cundari had died from cancer in 1990. In 2001, Maiola bought back the rights to the Koto name, and has released three more singles under that alias. He is now working with Roberto Bisca and Alex Cundari to compose new songs. Their first five singles are included on many Italo disco and '80s compilations and retrospectives.

The Eyre Affair =Victor Analogy= In his seventies, Analogy is the head of the Swindon branch of SO-27, the LiteraTecs, and is therefore Thursday's immediate superior. =Bowden Cable= An operative for SO-27, the LiteraTecs, assigned to the Swindon branch, and Thursday's partner after her transfer. In his thirties and with a slightly fussy, nervous edge to him, Bowden is intelligent and, at times, quite sly and cunning. He was responsible for thwarting the plans of Jack Schitt and the Goliath Corporation when he substituted a copy of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\" in place of the weapons manual that Schitt thought he was accessing. He shares his name with the braking cable on bicycles. Another character is called Sturmey Archer, also a manufacturer of bicycle gears. =Acheron Hades= Hugely intelligent and equally immoral (believes in doing what is morally evil, as opposed to amorality, which would mean not believing in a moral good or evil), Acheron Hades started out as a lecturer in English, teaching, among others, Thursday Next, before he turned to a life of crime. Believed by some to be only half- human, the other half being allegedly demonic or vampiric in nature (he casts no shadow), Acheron possesses a number of mysterious powers (as, indeed, do most of his siblings). He cannot be photographed or recorded in any way, and has shown the ability to know when his name is uttered within a considerable distance (a radius of 1000 yards, and possible further), hence his name is not often spoken aloud (compare Lord Voldemort, or The Chandrian). He has shown an immunity to the effects of most weapons, his only confirmed vulnerability being to silver. Said to have the ability to \\"lie in thought, word, action and appearance\\" he also possesses formidable powers of deception, including the ability to assume the shape of others and hypnotic persuasive abilities on the \\"weaker minded\\" (he is unable to hypnotise Thursday). Another ability that possibly follows in this vein is his ability to pass through glass barriers by making the glass soft and pliable through heated touch; after he withdraws his hand the glass reverts to its original state, the only sign of his trespass being the slightly mottled surface of the glass where his hand passed through (shown when Thursday examines the empty Chuzzlewit glass security casing). He appears to possess great strength, at one point easily smashing his way through a wall, although inertia still has an effect on him. Time does not seem to have a proper hold on him either, as when it is stopped around him by Colonel Next, he remains unaffected (this might possibly be why he does not seem to age). He is either very good at guessing or possesses some form of telepathy as he can figure out the personality faults and mental weaknesses of a person within moments. Hades appears as the principal villain of The Eyre Affair. He kidnaps Mycroft Next and steals his Prose Portal, using it to enter stolen original manuscripts of such classic tales as Martin Chuzzlewit and Jane Eyre, with the aim of extracting characters from them and holding them to ransom. When Thursday rescued the extracted Jane Eyre, Hades escaped into the book, pursued by Thursday. Ultimately, they confronted each other in Thornfield Hall, where Thursday was finally able to eliminate her opponent once and for all. Acheron is the eldest child of the Hades Family, which is apparently evil as a whole (only one member is mentioned as not really being evil, Lethe, the apparent \\"white sheep\\" of the family; another brother, Styx Hades, is shown to be more of a nuisance than really evil, committing pranks and not possessing any actual powers). It is also implied that they have been evil for generations; as Acheron's sister Aornis puts it, \\"No member of the Hades family has been captured alive for eighty-eight generations.\\" Hades has made the occasional appearance in the later books, showing up within Thursday's memories. Both 'Acheron' and 'Hades' refer to places in the mythical Greek underworld, as do 'Styx' and 'Lethe'. =Braxton Hicks= Hicks is in charge of several divisions of SpecOps in Swindon, including the Literary Detectives to whom Thursday transfers. He is perpetually concerned with the budget and seemingly nothing else. He allows Jack Schitt to have his way at first and seemingly faces up poorly to higher authority, but in Something Rotten he invents an elaborate cover story for Thursday after her return. He is often practising his putting in his office and coaxes Thursday to join him for a round of golf; she accepts out of gratitude for his alibi. Hicks has several grown children and by Something Rotten is planning to retire shortly. The name is an allusion to Braxton Hicks contractions near the end of pregnancy. =Mrs. Nakajima= A Japanese literary tourist and member of JurisFiction. In Lost in a Good Book, she gives Thursday the tools to become a JurisFiction agent herself. After her husband retires, the couple moved into Thornfield Hall in the novel Jane Eyre, where they manage the house, carefully avoiding any appearances in the narrative. =Anton Next= Brother to Thursday and Joffy Next and best friend of Landen Parke-Laine. He fought in the Crimean War and died there during a disastrous battle which occurred after he accidentally sent his unit off in the wrong direction (this mimics the role of Captain Louis Nolan in the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854; Anton directs the Light Armoured Brigade into the teeth of the Russian artillery). After much agonising over whether to tell the truth, Landen finally gave evidence to the inquest about Anton's error, which drove a wedge between him and Thursday, until the two reconciled during the events of The Eyre Afair. =Colonel Next= Thursday's father and ex-member of SO-12, the ChronoGuard. Went rogue, leading the ChronoGuard to delete him from history by interrupting his conception; however, due to his skills at time manipulation, still exists and drops in on his family from time to time to assist or pass on advice. By the events of Something Rotten, he has rejoined the ChronoGuard, albeit in a reduced capacity. In the end of First Among Sequels, he's reactualised. =Joffy Next= Brother of Thursday and Anton Next. He is a minister for the Global Standard Deity, which aims to represent all of the others equally and without prejudice, with the laudable aim of attempting to prevent religious conflict. Cheerful, frequently irreverent almost but (usually) not quite to the point of being irritating and laid-back, he nevertheless has an extremely caring nature and a great deal of wisdom, which serves him well in his chosen vocation. He generally calls Thursday 'Doofus' and used to slap her on the back of the head on a daily basis until she broke his nose to get him to stop, but the two are very close. As of Lost in a Good Book he is in a relationship with Miles Hawke, an operative with SpecOps-14. =Mycroft Next= Thursday's uncle and husband of Polly. Mycroft is an inventor of strange and unusual devices of varying degrees of use. Some have proved to be important plot devices throughout the series, such as his Prose Portal, which allowed real- world individuals to enter books and the Ovinator, which encourages cooperation. Others, such as his device for erasing memories (which he has no recollection of ever inventing) serve purely as running gags. He has been hunted by the Goliath Corporation, who wished to use his Prose Portal to retrieve fictional weaponry from the Bookworld to sell in the real world. He retired into the Bookworld, living within the Sherlock Holmes series of books, where he occasionally interfered with the narrative, appearing as Holmes' brother. By the time of Something Rotten he and Polly had returned safely to the real world, having used the memory erasure device to ensure that they were of no use to Goliath. =Polly Next= A brilliant mathematician, Thursday's aunt, and wife of Mycroft. She generally serves as Mycroft's assistant, as she possesses far more common sense than her husband. She was temporarily held hostage within the William Wordsworth poem I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud by Acheron Hades during the events of The Eyre Affair. Enjoys tormenting door-to- door salesmen along with Thursday's mother. =Thursday Next= =Wednesday Next= Mother to Thursday Next and her brothers. She used to work for SpecOps 3 (and claims to still do so on occasion), but has now become something of a homebody, and is generally found there throughout the novels. She loves her husband, despite his eradication, but has occasional suspicions about his fidelity, particularly regarding his dealings with Lady Emma Hamilton. She herself is not immune to other men, it transpires, as she develops an apparent interest in Otto Bismarck when he stays with her for a few days. On the other hand, having no official husband, she is believed by most to have conceived three children outside of wedlock, something that affects her social life. =Landen Parke-Laine= Thursday's husband, Landen is an award-winning novelist whose books include Bad Sofa, Memoirs of A Crimean Veteran and Once Were Scoundrels. He served as an officer in the Crimean War (still raging in Fforde's alternate 1985), during which he came into contact with Thursday, with whom he fell in love, and her brother Anton, who became his best friend. During the disastrous battle which became known as the \\"Charge of the Light- Armoured Brigade\\", Anton was killed and Landen lost a leg. During the subsequent inquest, Landen, after much agonizing, admitted that Anton had made an error that had led to the destruction of their unit. As a result, Thursday left him and refused to speak to him for ten years. They came back into contact during the events of The Eyre Affair, during which Thursday was finally able to forgive Landen and agreed to marry him. Despite his missing leg, he is relied upon in dangerous situations. During the events of Lost in a Good Book, Landen is eradicated from history by a rogue member of the Chronoguard, acting on behalf of the Goliath Corporation, who wish to blackmail Thursday into returning their operative Jack Schitt. He then appears only in Thursday's memories until reactualised during Something Rotten. His name is one of Fforde's trademark puns: in the British edition of the board game Monopoly, Park Lane is the second-to-last street on the board and consequently one of the most expensive. As additions to this pun, Landen's late father is named Billden Parke-Laine and his mother is named Houson Parke- Laine. =Pickwick= Thursday's pet dodo, brought to life by genetic engineering. Originally she was believed to be male, but revealed to be female during the events of Lost in a Good Book, when she lays an egg. This ultimately hatches, producing her son, Alan. The name is a reference to Dickens's Pickwick Papers. =Jack Schitt= Head of the Goliath Corporation's internal security service and their Advanced Weapons Division, and thus a man of great power. He showed great interest in Mycroft Next's Prose Portal, hoping to use it to retrieve fictional weaponry, having utterly failed to make the equivalent weapon work in the real world, to the extent that he was willing to work with the criminal Acheron Hades in order to gain access. Once Hades was defeated within Jane Eyre, Schitt used the Prose Portal to enter what he thought was the manual for the plasma rifle that he wanted to retrieve, only to discover that Bowden Cable had slipped a copy of \\"The Raven\\" by Edgar Allan Poe inside the manual's dust cover instead. The Portal closed behind him, trapping him there. He was ultimately retrieved by Thursday during the events of Lost in a Good Book, after Goliath arranged to have her husband Landen eradicated from history by the Chronoguard in order to blackmail her. She cooperated, only to find herself double-crossed. Schitt, however, never returned to his original position in the corporation; when next seen, during the events of Something Rotten, he has been demoted to a far lesser role within Goliath and makes only a brief appearance. His name is a pun on 'jack shit', meaning 'nothing'. =Filbert Snood= A member of SpecOps 12, the ChronoGuard, Filbert dated Thursday until he experienced a mishap in the timestream and was too embarrassed to tell her. Thursday runs into him again while both are working for SpecOps 5 in pursuit of Acheron Hades. When introduced to \\"Snood,\\" Thursday assumes he is his father and doesn't discover his true identity until he is killed by Hades. =Spike Stoker= Spike works for SO-17 and is the sole agent for that department assigned to the Reading area. He deals with undead paranormals and the capturing of Supreme Evil Beings, and occasionally enlists Thursday Next to assist with his work in exchange for money. Later in the series, he marries a woman named Cindy, who he believes to be a librarian, but is in fact an assassin. \\"Stoker\\" is a reference to Bram Stoker, author of Dracula; \\"Spike\\" may be a reference to the shape of the wooden stakes that he uses in his line of work. Spike is almost on his own against the forces of darkness, yet is arguably the cheeriest person seen in the books: he is jocular, easy-going and is rarely serious or distressed in his work. He loses his cool only rarely; and although he once, seemingly in a fit of depression, considered the possibility of self- sacrifice/suicide, admitting that \\"battling the undead was never a bowl of cherries,\\" he was in fact trying to trick both Thursday and a Supreme Evil Being. In Something Rotten he offers to take Thursday's place in the afterworld when she is about to die, now knowing that his wife is an assassin, but Thursday persuades him to stay for the sake of their daughter Betty. Ultimately, his wife gives her life to save Thursday. He is described as a tall, muscular man with blond dreadlocks and sunglasses. It was once hinted that he suffers from either lycanthropy or vampirism and requires regular \\"medication\\"; without it he will sometimes lose control of himself and exhibit wolflike behavior, such as eating live mice. =Other Minor Characters= Other members of staff at the Swindon branch of SO-27, appear from time to time and are notable chiefly because their names are puns on Sea Areas known to UK radio listeners from the Shipping Forecast on BBC Radio 4. These characters include Jim Crometty (named after the Sea Area 'Cromarty'); Sergeant Ross ('Ross'); Finisterre ('Finisterre', which was renamed 'FitzRoy' in 2002); Fisher ('Fisher'); Helmut Bight ('German Bight'); Malin ('Malin'); Sole ('Sole'); and the Forty brothers, Jeff and Geoff ('Forties'). Strictly speaking, Crometty does not appear in the book - having been murdered and replaced in the Swindon LiteraTecs team by Thursday. Dr. Runcible Spoon (Professor of English Literature at Swindon University) is named after the utensil with which The Owl and the Pussycat dine on \\"mince and slices of quince\\" in a nonsense rhyme by Edward Lear. Detective Inspector Oswald Mandias of Yorkshire CID (the policeman investigating the theft of the Jane Eyre manuscript from the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum in Haworth) is named after Ozymandias, the eponymous subject of Shelley's 1818 sonnet. Lost in a Good Book =The Bellman= The head of JurisFiction. During the events of Lost in a Good Book and The Well of Lost Plots, this position is filled by an unnamed individual who is only ever referred to by his title. He was murdered in the latter, by Libris, weeks from retirement, and replaced by an obedient clone of himself. Following the successful intervention of The Great Panjandrum, the clone was demoted, and Thursday was then asked to assume the role, which she accepted, holding the position for around two years before resigning during the events of Something Rotten. The Bellman is hinted to be the lead character in Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark. He urges the PROs to \\"be careful out there\\", quoting the roll-call sergeant from Hill Street Blues. =The Cheshire Cat= Due to boundary changes (a reference to the Local Government Commissions) the Cheshire Cat is now technically referred to as the Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat, but still generally known by his original appellation. He serves as an √ºber-librarian to the Grand Library, as well as a high-ranking JurisFiction official. His work is especially significant in Something Rotten, where after years of searching he finds Yorrick Kaine's origin--a self-published novel not even in the Library--and engages Kaine in a Merlin-versus-Madame Mim-esque battle of summoning literary warriors, eventually calling upon the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio to turn Kaine into a real person. =Vernham Deane= Resident cad within Daphne Farquitt's The Squire of High Potternews, Deane is an accomplished JurisFiction agent who in reality is nothing like his character in his novel. He is a potential target in The Well of Lost Plots along with Perkins and Havisham, but his disappearance makes him a suspect instead. He is revealed to have been hiding for his own safety with the serving girl he ravishes, with whom he is actually in love. They and Quasimodo help Thursday foil Harris Tweed and his cohorts, and Potternews is finally granted an Internal Plot Readjustment to allow Vernham and his lover to marry happily. His name presumably derives from the Hampshire village of Vernham Dean. =Daphne Farquitt= A reclusive septuagenarian author of trashy romances, Farquitt began writing in the 1930s and has little real variation in plot between her novels. Vernham Deane is one of her characters. Because she is the author of the vanity-published At Long Last Lust, origin of Yorrick Kaine, Kaine starts a campaign against all things Danish in an attempt to destroy every remaining copy of his book (Farquitt having been born in Copenhagen) so he cannot be deleted from within. Hamlet claims to have brought her and tens of thousands of her fans to the Superhoop to stop Kaine's interference, but in reality it was only nine fans and Farquitt remains as elusive as ever. =Cordelia Flakk= Cordelia is an attractive senior SpecOps agent who works in Public Relations. She spends the whole of Lost in a Good Book persistently trying to get Thursday to do press interviews regarding the alterations made to the storyline of Jane Eyre during the events of The Eyre Affair. =Aornis Hades= The younger sister of Acheron Hades, who appeared as a villain in Lost in a Good Book. Aornis Hades is a mnemonomorph, a person who can alter memories at will; she can also apparently alter entropy, a concept of science. The general law of entropy, as presented in the book, states that reactions can only become more chaotic; a plate can fall to the ground and shatter, but it cannot reassemble. Aornis lowers entropy, causing extremely large-scale and bizarre coincidences to occur. She held the world to ransom in Lost, giving Thursday the ultimatum that she would stop her plan if Thursday takes her own life. With her plan thwarted at the last minute by the intervention of Colonel Next, Aornis escaped. In First Among Sequels, she is seen imprisoned by the Chronoguard, in a time-loop inside the T.K. Maxx department store. A mental copy of Aornis, embedded in Thursday's memories, made several appearances during the events of The Well of Lost Plots, often interacting with other 'personas' as recalled by Next. This copy was capable of altering Thursday's memories to suit her own purposes, but was finally defeated when she summoned Thursday's worst memory, which turned out to be a childhood nightmare. The Aornis copy was unable to control it and it destroyed her, and Thursday was left with the reassurance that defeating the real Aornis would now be easy. Thursday claims that Aornis's name is derived from the fact that the Acheron, Lethe, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Aornis rivers are all tributaries to the river Styx. However, in canonical descriptions of the underworld, there is no river by the name Aornis, nor are the other rivers tributary to the Styx- however they do all flow through the Greek Underworld and separate its different regions. =Miss Havisham= Miss Havisham is a member of the JurisFiction originating in the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. She was assigned as Thursday Next's mentor when the younger woman first joined JurisFiction and tutored her through her examinations to become a fully fledged agent. A highly respected member of JurisFiction and one of their best operatives, her hobbies included driving powerful cars at terrifyingly high speeds. This hobby was eventually used against her during the events of The Well of Lost Plots, when a car she was driving was sabotaged, causing her to crash. Badly burned, she returned to her novel, where she and Pip staged her death within the novel. She is replaced by a generic understudy, which is understood by all to be 'not the same'. =Yorrick Kaine= Yorrick Kaine is a fictional character, originating in a highly limited self-published early novel by the author Daphne Farquitt. Kaine became a 'pagerunner', a character who escapes his or her own book and ultimately left the Bookworld altogether for the real world, where he ran for high political office during the events of Lost in a Good Book, only to be thwarted by Thursday and JurisFiction. By the events of Something Rotten, Kaine had advanced to the office of Chancellor, making him the second most powerful man in the land. He was using Mycroft Next's invention, the Ovinator, to manipulate Parliament into doing what he wanted. During the events of that novel, where he was made real and ultimately lost the Ovinator, he was removed from power. First Among Sequels reveals he has been arrested and imprisoned. =Lavoisier= Member of the ChronoGuard and former partner of Colonel Next. Appears briefly at the end of Eyre Affair, questioning Thursday about her father. He plays a much larger role in Lost in a Good Book, where he is hired by Goliath to eradicate Landen Parke-Laine. He holds a strong grudge against Thursday Next, and refuses to honor his part of the deal between her and Goliath as revenge for \\"what she did to him.\\" This action has yet to occur in Thursday's timeline. =Gran Next= Always clad in blue gingham, 108-year-old Gran Next claims not to be able to die until she's read the ten most boring classics. She helps Thursday realize her bookjumping abilities by having her read The Flopsy Bunnies aloud over and over. In The Well of Lost Plots she comes to stay with Thursday in Caversham Heights and helps her to remember Landen and defeat Aornis's mindworm, assuring her that the real Aornis will be much easier. Gran's identity comes into question later on when Thursday realizes that both her grandmothers are long dead and she's only known Gran Next for about three years. Finally when Thursday is sentenced for her Jane Eyre fiction infraction--twenty years in blue gingham and having to read the ten most boring classics before she can die--she realizes that Gran is herself seventy years in the future. As friends and yet-unborn family members gather, Thursday reads the last paragraph of The Faerie Queene to Gran, who dies peacefully. Gran's long life includes many interesting jobs, such as working in many different divisions of SpecOps, spending twenty-four hours as a man and ruling as God Emperor of the Universe. =Perkins and Snell= David \\"Pinky\\" Perkins and Akrid Snell were the lead characters in a set of detective novels and both worked as JurisFiction agents. Perkins headed up the Grammasite Research facility, in a land appropriated from an unpublished fantasy novel (The Sword of the Zenobians), which is populated by many fictional creatures who were unable to live safely within their own novels. He was slain when the Minotaur, held captive within the fantasy, was deliberately released to kill him. Snell worked as the lawyer for JurisFiction. He is the first to contact Thursday by Footnoterphone in Lost in a Good Book, and as head of the JurisFiction legal team defends her at her first hearing in Franz Kafka's The Trial. When contact was lost with Perkins, he, accompanied by Thursday Next, Miss Havisham and Commander Bradshaw, entered the research facility to investigate. When a sample of the misspelling vyrus was released within Perkin's laboratory, Snell stayed behind to attempt to deal with it. He died from his injuries shortly afterwards. =Brik Schitt-Hawse= A senior Goliath employee and half-brother of Jack Schitt. Schitt-Hawse is primarily responsible for the eradication from history of Landen Parke-Laine during the events of Lost in a Good Book, in order to blackmail Thursday into retrieving Jack Schitt from inside Poe's The Raven. Thursday agreed to retrieve Schitt, only for Schitt-Hawse to subsequently imprison her, intending to study her bookjumping ability in order to open up new potential markets for the Goliath Corporation within fiction. Thursday was able to escape with the assistance of Miss Havisham and went to live in the Bookworld in order to hide from Goliath. Schitt-Hawse reappeared briefly in Something Rotten, when Thursday visited the CEO of the Goliath Corporation during a board meeting. He is almost invariably accompanied by his henchmen, Mr. Chalk and Mr. Cheese, although by the time of Something Rotten Cheese has been reassigned to work at a Goliath-owned caf√©. His name is a homonym of 'brick shithouse', from the phrase 'built like a brick shithouse'. =Bartholomew Stiggins= Bartholomew Stiggins is a Neanderthal and head of the Swindon branch of SpecOps-13. He helped Thursday out during the events of Lost in a Good Book when she has a run-in, engineered by Aornis Hades, with another Neanderthal. He reappears during Something Rotten, when he accompanies her to the old Goliath laboratory facilities in the hope of finding information that would allow his race to breed successfully, something that was left out when their race was brought back to life through genetic engineering. In return for Thursday's assistance, Stiggins helps her win a critical croquet game by providing a number of Neanderthal players to fill gaps on the team. His name is a reference to Stig of the Dump. =Cindy Stoker= Cindy is a professional assassin known as the Windowmaker (the first use of that name was due to a typographical error in a newspaper) who has finished off sixty-seven people (sixty-eight if you count Samuel Pring, but she later admits that was a fluke). In Something Rotten she has a contract to exterminate Thursday. Cindy is aware that Thursday knows she is an assassin, while Thursday knows Cindy wants to kill her. Spike is oblivious to both of these facts, and is happily married to her. After she is hit on the head by a falling piano stool she offers to replace a dying Thursday on her way to the afterlife, knowing she will never leave prison if she survives or be with Spike or their daughter again, and making up partly for her crimes. =Harris Tweed= A JurisFiction agent from the real world. He is revealed as being a villain towards the end of The Well of Lost Plots. As a result of his actions, Tweed was banished from the Bookworld and now lives in Swindon. His name is a pun on both a type of rugged woollen cloth called Harris Tweed, and on the Eagle comics' similar character, Harris Tweed. The Well of Lost Plots =Melanie Bradshaw= Wife of Trafford Bradshaw, to whom she has now been married for fifty years (the pair celebrate their golden wedding anniversary at the end of Something Rotten). As the books never describe her character to any great degree, Melanie remains in the background. Hence, no reader ever discovers that she is, in fact, a gorilla, although she often attempts to dress in standard female clothing, with varying degrees of success. Melanie often babysits Friday Next when Thursday is off on assignment and the two are very close. =Commander Trafford Bradshaw= The main character of a series of 1920s adventure stories for boys. An early Booksplorer, Bradshaw now works as an agent for JurisFiction (he is a former Bellman as well) and is considered to be one of their best operatives; his maps, while sometimes incomplete, are a most trusted resource for Bookworld explorers. =The Great Panjandrum= The supposed creator of the BookWorld, and is worshipped as a god. Appears at the end of Well as a literal deus ex machina, as it is summoned by Thursday through an emergency glass box inside her standard issue equipment. It is unclear of the Great Panjandrum's true nature, and its appearance is based on the appearance of whoever views it; for example, Thursday sees it as a woman in her mid-thirties, like herself, while a noted Jurisfiction sculptor perceived the entity as a fellow stonemason. The Great Panjandrum is a reference to a line of nonsense verse by Samuel Foote. =The Minotaur= Wanted murderer in the Book World, he escapes and works under the alias of Norman Johnson. In Something Rotten he is tainted with Slapstick to help track him across fiction, but he uses it to try to kill Thursday several times. Based on the minotaur from Greek mythology. =Randolph and Lola= Assigned to stay with Thursday in the unpublished novel Caversham Heights during the events of Lost in a Good Book, Randolph and Lola started out as truly generic characters, being sexless, ageless, nameless and with no distinguishing features of any kind. Under Thursday's influence, the pair gradually began to take on more distinctive characteristics, developing personalities, choosing genders, apparent ages and final names, Thursday having initially dubbed them as obb and ibb respectively, just to distinguish between them. The two later gained capital letters before changing names. Randolph took on the persona and appearance of a gentleman in his fifties, hoping to be cast in the role of a father figure or kindly mentor. Lola developed as an attractive young woman, aiming for a position as heroine in an adventure-style tale. Although the pair argued constantly, they ultimately realized that they were in love and were instrumental in the reorganization of Caversham Heights into a book where characters from other novels could take holidays away from the rather repetitious nature of their roles. =DCI Jack Spratt= Jack Spratt is the main character in the unpublished novel Caversham Heights where Thursday stays as part of the Character Exchange Program during the events of The Well of Lost Plots. He is also the protagonist in his own series of books written by Fforde. =Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle= Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is an active JurisFiction agent and their washerwoman. She trains Emperor Zhark and advocates for the appearances of hedgehogs in other works such as mentions in Shakespeare's plays. After Thursday's retirement she helps to run JurisFiction and visits Thursday asking for help. =Emperor Zhark= A ruthless tyrant from a series of sci-fi novels, Zhark begins work at JurisFiction around the same time as Thursday and is apprenticed to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. His conflicts within his books, often involving the lives of millions, are a point of contention requiring the Judgement of Solomon. Often punished for overdoing it, such as when he invades a Western with his armies to save Thursday, accidentally killing the main character. When he learns that his author, Handley Paige, is planning to kill him off, he manages to track him down and convince him otherwise. Something Rotten =Millon de Floss= Millon is a member of the Amalgamated Union of Stalkers, authorised by SpecOps-33. He has something of a talent for spotting rising stars, having started stalking the legendary actress Lola Vavoom when she was just a bit part player. He is now a Grade 1 stalker, allowed to stalk the very highest level of celebrity, but has, instead, chosen to become Thursday's officially licensed stalker, feeling that she, while not at the highest level as yet, is destined for great things. Having published his autobiography A Stalk on the Wild Side, Millon has attained a not- inconsiderable level of celebrity himself and has his own stalker, Adam Gnusense (who, as an experienced stalker himself, having risen to Grade 3, has recently acquired his own stalker, who he describes as being a Grade 34 loser after catching him rummaging through his dustbins). Millon is intelligent, polite and has considerable knowledge of conspiracy theories, a resource that Thursday draws upon when trying to locate a clone of William Shakespeare. He accompanied her to Area 21, an area in mid-Wales where the Goliath Corporation had their laboratories, to help out. As this was technically outside the remit of his stalker activities, he asked, in return, if he could be her official biographer, something to which Thursday readily agreed. Many of the excerpts from fictional works found at the beginning of each chapter have ostensibly been written by de Floss. His name is an allusion to the novel The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, which Thursday and Miss Havisham visit on assignment in The Well of Lost Plots. =George Formby= Made England's President-for-life after his resistance work during the German Occupation, and his song \\"When I'm Washing Windows\\" becomes the national anthem. In 1988 he is still entertaining whenever possible, and he is the only politician who avoids Yorrick Kaine enough to remain immune to the ovinator and thus oppose Kaine's schemes. He dies of natural causes two days after the Swindon Mallets win the Superhoop croquet championship and serenades the ferryman on his final journey. In real life, George Formby died in 1961, at the age of 56. =John Henry Goliath V= Named after two giants and quite tall himself, John Henry Goliath V is the great-great-grandson of the founder of the Goliath Corporation and its current CEO. He meets with Thursday personally to apologize to her, but in reality he used Goliath's ovinator to convince her to forgive them. His fate after Goliath's loss to the Toast Marketing Board is unknown. =Hamlet= The Prince of Denmark, from the Shakespeare play. He accompanied Thursday on her return to the real world at the beginning of Something Rotten, as he was concerned at the perception in the Outland that he was an indecisive character. During his time there, he became romantically involved with Lady Emma Hamilton and found a new decisiveness within himself, one that he originally planned to take back into his play and rewrite it from within, portraying himself as a much more dynamic character. Ultimately, however, he came to realise that the flaws in his character are what make his play memorable and much loved, and elected to leave his play as it was. He chose to focus his energies elsewhere, joining JurisFiction as their agent for the Shakespearean and Marlowe plays. Hamlet's Danish origins are a point of contention during Kaine's anti-Denmark campaign, but he bluffs Kaine into thinking he has gathered an army of Daphne Farquitt fans and the Copenhagen- born author herself to save Thursday at a critical moment. As a parting gift, Thursday gave Hamlet Alan the dodo, the tearaway son of her own dodo, Pickwick, to take with him, as Hamlet had proven to be the only one able to get Alan to behave himself. =Tuesday Next= Daughter of Thursday Next. She first appeared at the very end of Something Rotten, when many of Thursday's as-yet unborn descendants appear. In First Among Sequels, she is shown to be a mathematical genius, having solved Fermat's Last Theorem at the age of nine. =Friday Next= Friday is the son of Thursday and Landen Parke-Laine. While he is an infant during the chronology of the novels, Friday later joins SO-12, the Chronoguard, rising to become head of the department and, according to his grandfather, Colonel Next, a time manipulator of extraordinary skill. As such, he appears as an adult on a couple of occasions in the books, although is unidentified until the end of Something Rotten. As a baby, Friday speaks only Lorem Ipsum, due to his upbringing in the Bookworld. He is close to Melanie Bradshaw, who frequently baby-sat for him. In First Among Sequels, Friday is apparently a lazy, slovenly adolescent whom Thursday calls a \\"tedious teenage clich√©: grunting, sighing at any request, and staying in bed until past midday.\\" In actuality, this indolence is a cover for his secret agenda to overthrow Chronoguard, which his future self has found to be corrupt. =William Shgakespeafe= The only surviving clone of William Shakespeare, created in a secret long-abandoned project by Goliath. He is rescued by Thursday, Bowden, Stig, and Spike, and is recruited by JurisFiction to rewrite Hamlet and The Merry Wives of Windsor, which merged in Hamlet's absence. Shgakespeafe appears to be just as talented a writer as Shakespeare; indeed, all of his lines in Something Rotten are quotes from Shakespeare's plays. He is athletically skilled, having lived much of his life avoiding cloned creatures. His name developed from a typo at Jasper Fforde's keyboard, which he subsequently loved. =St Zvlkx= A thirteenth-century prophet from Swindon, St Zvlkx's sixth Revealment was a prediction of his own resurrection in 1988, which Joffy Next prepares for by learning Old English to communicate with the saint. Joffy and the Idolatry Friends of St Zvlkx had sold the seer's wisdom to the Toast Marketing Board, which Zvlkx approved of. Over his stay in the twentieth century he is revealed to live nothing like a saintly life, and he is killed by a bus on the way to a bookie's. After Thursday helps the Swindon Mallets croquet team win the Superhoop, fulfilling the seventh and final Revealment, Thursday's father explains that Zvlkx had travelled through time himself, and that his Revealments were in fact bets now worth billions of pounds. Because the bookie's was owned ultimately by Goliath, the Toast Marketing Board took control of the majority of the multinational and ended their reign over England. First Among Sequels =Jenny Next= Jenny is the youngest of Thursday's three children, and ten years old during the time of the 5th novel. She is the only child in Thursday's family not to be named after a day of the week, so that (in Thursday's words) \\"one of us should have a semblance of normality\\". Jenny never actually makes an appearance during the novel, and is later revealed to be nonexistent, placed in Thursday's mind in an act of vengeance by Aornis Hades. Thursday occasionally remembers this, then forgets that she has remembered. Thursday's family understands this and works to keep 'Jenny' alive to save her from torment. Jenny is revealed to have a 'life' of her own, as imaginary entities are stories themselves. And fictional entities can interact with the real world. Later, through the actions of outside forces, the entire family comes to remember Jenny as a loving and kind daughter who passed away young in a transportation accident. =Thursday1-4= Thursday1-4 is the fictional version of Thursday Next, the main character of the first four books in a bestselling series loosely based on Thursday's adventures in SpecOps and Jurisfiction. Thursday1-4 is portrayed as unnecessarily violent and somewhat sleazy, and the real Thursday describes her as being \\"mostly action, and very little thought.\\" Despite the books being set several years before, Thursday1-4's apparent age is identical to the real Thursday, a fact that is explained in One of Our Thursdays Is Missing. =Thursday5= Thursday5 is the main character in the fifth book of the Thursday Next series. In response to the real Thursday's complaints about her portrayal in the first four books, and her insistence that the fifth book in the series reflect her more sensitive side, the fictional Thursday5 is depicted as overly softhearted and a bit of a hippie. Thursday takes her on as a cadet for training for Jurisfiction, but is consistently frustrated by Thursday5's incompetence and excessive pacifism. Like Thursday1-4, Thursday5 also looks identical to the real Thursday, despite a supposed age difference. One of Our Thursdays Is Missing The Woman Who Died a Lot * Thursday Next ","title":"Characters in the Thursday Next series"},{"id":"1914895","text":"Zahir al-Umar al-Zaydani, alternatively spelled Daher al-Omar or Dahir al-Umar (, 1689/90 ‚Äì 21 or 22 August 1775) was the autonomous Arab ruler of northern Palestine in the mid-18th century,Philipp, ed. Bosworth, \\"·∫íƒÅhir al-  øUmar al- ZaydƒÅnƒ´\\". while the area was still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire. For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of Galilee, with successive headquarters in Tiberias, Arraba, Nazareth, Deir Hanna and finally Acre, in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid-1760s, he reestablished the port town of Haifa nearby. Zahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the Sidon and Damascus provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of the Eyalet of Egypt and with backing from Russia, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after. The wealth Zahir accumulated through monopolizing Palestine's cotton and olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local peasantry. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged Christian and Jewish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants from other parts of the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the Zaydani clan, also patronized the construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among Palestinians today. Early life Zahir's home in Arraba Zahir was born in the village of 'Arrabat al-Battuf in central Galilee.Philipp, 2001, p. 30. His date of birth is not definitively known, with the years 1686, 1689/90 and 1694 cited by Zahir's contemporary biographers Volney, Mikha'il Sabbagh and Khalil al-Muradi, respectively. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, 1689/1690 is the most likely year of his birth because he considers Sabbagh to be the most reliable source for Zahir's personal life.Joudah, 1987, p. 29. The proper transliteration of his given name is ·∫íƒÅhir, but in the local dialect of Arabic used in Galilee, his name is pronounced ·∏åƒÅhir. Zahir's family, the Zaydani clan, were Sunni MuslimHarris, 2012, p. 114 notables from the Qaisi tribal confederation based in the Tiberias area who had strong connections to the Arab-Bedouin tribesmen of Galilee, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire. Zahir was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh Umar al- Zaydani;Pappe, 2010, p. 35. his brothers were Sa'd, Salih \\"Abu Dani\\" and Yusuf, and his sister was Shammah. Zahir grew up in the village of Saffuriya. Zahir's father and grandfather had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon.Philipp, 2001, p. 31 In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate.Moammar, 1990, pp. 43‚Äì44. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became the head of the family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that in the event of a default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan. In 1707, Zahir was involved in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir played an important role in defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local peasantry throughout the 1720s. Along with Sa'd, he also gained prestige among the people of Damascus, with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father. Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the sharifs of Damascus at the time; Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to Nazareth because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.Philipp, 2001, pp. 31‚Äì32. Rule =Consolidation of power in Galilee= Remains of the citadel at Tiberias which Zahir built early in his rule In the late 1720s, Zahir and his brother Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, captured Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to K√∂pr√ºl√º Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe.Joudah, 1987, pp. 22-23 This was the first time a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon.Philipp, 2001, p. 32 Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.Philipp, 2001, p. 33 Zahir extended his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in Safad Sanjak, but controlled by the Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak) caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer,Joudah, 1987, p. 28. killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth.Doumani, 1995, pp. 41‚Äì42. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.Joudah, 1987, p. 31. Following his victory at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, including many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops with food and water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.Philipp, 2001, p. 34 In 1738, Zahir's forces captured the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule complained that he governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict.Joudah, 1987, p. 23. The Omari Mosque in Tiberias, built by Zahir Bi'ina, which was also fortified, withstood a siege by Zahir in 1739, but Zahir later married the daughter of Bi'ina's mukhtar (headman), and thus brought Bi'ina into his domain. He also acquired the fortress of Suhmata through diplomatic means,Joudah, 1987, p. 24. further solidifying his rule over northern and eastern Galilee. In 1740, Zahir made an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to end their looting raids in the area. By then, Sa'd had taken control of Deir Hanna and Muhammad ibn Ali captured Shefa-'Amr, entrenching the presence of the Zaydani clan in western Galilee. After negotiations, Muhammad al-Naf'i, the multazim of Safad, surrendered the city to Zahir. Safad was the administrative seat of the sanjak and situated on a strategic hill overlooking the Galilee countryside.Joudah, 1987, pp. 23‚Äì24. Zahir later acquired the fortified village of Deir al-Qassi after marrying the daughter of its sheikh, Abd al-Khaliq Salih. Zahir's conquest of the Safad region and western Galilee removed the barriers between him and the Metawali (Shia Muslim) clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, Nasif al-Nassar, of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of al-Bassa and Yaroun on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of Tarbikha. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in Tibnin. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al-Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus; in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon.Joudah, 1987, pp. 26‚Äì27. Zahir, similar to other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not owe their power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The Ottoman Sultan sent an order to the governor of Damascus Eyalet, Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, to put an end to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the Hajj pilgrim caravan.Moammar, 1990, pp. 71‚Äì82. Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the wali of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and Irbid, Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in Lubya and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp.Joudah, 1987, p. 37 In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking Saffuriya.Khalidi, 1992, p. 351. =Ruler of Acre= Interior of the al-Muallaq Mosque built by Zahir in 1758 Zahir consolidated his authority over Acre in a drawn-out process starting in the 1730s. His Acre-based partner, the Melkite merchant Yusuf al-Qassis, served as an early link between Zahir and the French merchants of Acre.Philipp, 2001, p. 35. Zahir's first contact with the merchants came in 1731 when he arranged the settlement of debts owed to them by his brother Sa'd.Raymond, 1990, p. 135. In 1743, To stymie his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali's ambitions in Acre, Zahir had him arrested and executed. In 1743, Zahir requested the tax farm of Acre from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, who, wary of Zahir's growing power in the province, rejected the request. Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746.Philipp, 2001, p. 36 In the first few years following his takeover of Acre, Zahir resided in the fortress of Deir Hanna in the heart of Galilee. He began fortifying Acre by building walls around the city in 1750. He built other fortifications and buildings in Acre as well. In 1757 he took control of the Mediterranean port villages of Haifa and Tantura, and nearby Mount Carmel, all of which had been part of Damascus Eyalet, unlike most of Zahir's domain at the time, which was in Sidon Eyalet. He also captured the port village of al-Tira, between Tantura and Haifa, at that time. Zahir's stated justification to the Ottoman authorities for conquering Palestine's northern coastal plain was to protect the area from Maltese pirates.Joudah, 1987, p. 27. In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir maintained ties with,Joudah, 1987, pp. 41‚Äì42. launched an assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government),Joudah, 1987, p. 40. and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al-hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year. Husayn Pasha's replacement, Uthman Pasha al- Kurji,Philipp, 2001, p. 39 who took office in 1760,Joudah, 1987, p. 143. sought to retrieve control of Haifa from Zahir. Uthman Pasha requested that the governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761.Joudah, 1987, p. 48. The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over with the assistance of an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders. =Intra-family conflict= Remains of the fort at Deir Hanna that was built by Zahir's brother Sa'd. Zahir resided in Deir Hanna before moving to Acre In 1761, Zahir ordered his son Uthman al-Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him.Joudah, 1987, p. 51. Sa'd's assassination indirectly led to the first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa-'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa-'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full-brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa-'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and most loyal son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762. The brothers' efforts to recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and subsequently had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa for six months before exiling him to a village near Safad.Joudah, 1987, p. 52. Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the Haifa Bay, was built on a narrow strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel to make it easier to defend by land.Yazbak, 1998, p. 14. In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab (the Sunni leader of a Druze faction) and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir Yusuf Shihab (the leader of another Druze faction) and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman. Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of Hasbaya culminated in a successful peace summit near Tyre between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth.Joudah, pp. 52‚Äì53. In September 1767, conflict between Zahir and his son Ali al-Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al-Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among his brothers and in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al-Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over Tur'an and Hittin.Joudah, 1987, p. 54. Ali refused to negotiate, gained the backing of Salibi, and the two defeated their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774‚Äì75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.Joudah, 1987, p. 56. In 1768 the central Ottoman authorities partially recognized or legitimized Zahir's de facto political position by granting him the title of \\"Sheikh of Acre, Emir of Nazareth, Tiberias, Safed, and Sheikh of all Galilee\\". However, this official recognition was tempered when Yaqub Agha was executed shortly after and Sulayman Agha died in 1770, depriving Zahir of close allies in Istanbul. In November 1770, Uthman Pasha had the governor of Sidon replaced by his son Darwish Pasha and had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed governor of Tripoli Eyalet. Uthman Pasha was committed to ending Zahir's rule, and Zahir's position was left particularly vulnerable with the loss of support in Istanbul.Philipp, 2001, pp. 39‚Äì40. In response to threats from Damascus, Zahir further strengthened Acre's fortifications and armed every adult male in the city with a rifle, two pistols and a sabre. He also moved to mend ties with his sons, who held various tax farms in Galilee, and consolidate his relationship with the Shia clans of Jabal Amil, thereby strengthening his local alliances.Philipp, 2001, p. 40 =Alliance with Ali Bey and war with Damascus= Although Zahir was bereft of friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new alliance with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al-Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey.Philipp, 2001, p. 41 Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made it as far as Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.Rogan, 2009, p. 50 Zahir was surprised and angered by Ismail's reticence to attack. In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including Quneitra, while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Banu Nu'aym tribe in Hauran, also part of Damascus.Joudah, 1987, p. 70. In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under Abu al-Dhahab in May. Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa, the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of Sidon from Darwish Pasha. However, Abu al-Dhahab was persuaded by Ismail that confronting the Ottoman sultan, who carried a high religious authority as the caliph of Islam, was \\"truly ... a scheme of the Devil\\" and a crime against their religion.Rogan, 2009, p. 51 A short time after capturing Damascus, Abu al-Dhahab and Ismail subsequently withdrew from the city, whose inhabitants were \\"completely astonished at this amazing event\\", according to a chronicler of the time period. The sudden turn of events compelled Zahir's forces to withdraw from Sidon on 20 June.Joudah, 1987, p. 81. Abu al-Dhahab's withdrawal frustrated Zahir who proceeded to make independent moves, first by capturing Jaffa in August 1771, after driving out its governor Ahmad Bey Tuqan, and shortly thereafter, capturing the cotton- producing Bani Sa'b region (centered around modern-day Tulkarm), which was held by Mustafa Bey Tuqan.Doumani, 1995, p. 95 Zahir had Jaffa fortified and stationed 2,000 troops there. By the end of August, Zahir remained in control of Jaffa, while Uthman Pasha had restored his control over Ramla and Gaza.Joudah, 1987, p. 84. =Peak of power= Zahir decisively defeated the army of Governor Uthman Pasha al-Kurji near Lake Hula In an attempt to expand his zone of influence to Nablus, the commercial center of Palestine and its agriculturally-rich hinterland, Zahir besieged Nablus in late 1771. By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful Jarrar clan,Doumani, 1995, p. 96 who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the miri (hajj pilgrimage tax).Joudah, 1987, p. 88. Nablus was under the de facto control of the Tuqan and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated. Uthman Pasha had resumed his governorship of Damascus at the end of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al-Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al-Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached Lake Hula at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops. Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al-Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the Jordan River, the only place where they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300‚Äì500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men.Joudah, 1987, p. 85. The Battle of Lake Hula marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary gun salutes by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign. Following his victory against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, which he did on 13 October. He returned two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, only to have the pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al-Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte.Joudah, 1987, p. 86 Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.Philipp, 2001, p. 42. Muhammad Tuqan captured Jaffa from Zahir in May 1772, the same month that Ali Bey arrived in Acre to seek Zahir's protection after being forced out of Egypt by rival mamluks. In June, the Ottoman loyalist Jazzar Pasha sought to establish himself in Lebanon and took over Beirut from the local Druze chieftains. The Druze had previously been in conflict with Zahir, but due to Jazzar's offensive, the circumstances fostered an alliance between them, Zahir and the Metawali clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir and Ali Bey sought to take back Jaffa and, with help from the Russian Fleet, succeeded after a nine-month siege, in which they exhausted many of their resources. Prior to that, in late October 1772, Zahir and his Lebanese allies captured Beirut from Jazzar, also with Russian naval support. In March 1773, Ali Bey left Palestine to reestablish himself in Egypt, but Abu al-Dhahab had him killed when he arrived there. With this came an end to the alliance between Zahir and Ali Bey, which had brought together Egypt and Palestine politically and economically in a way that had not occurred since the early 16th century.D. Crecelius: \\"Egypt's Reawakening Interest in Palestine During the Regimes of Ali Bey al-Kabir and Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dahab: 1760‚Äì1775\\". In Kushner, 1986, p. 247 While their attempts to unite their territories economically and politically were unsuccessful, their rule posed the most serious domestic challenge to Ottoman rule in the 18th century.D. Crecelius: \\"Egypt's Reawakening Interest in Palestine During the Regimes of Ali Bey al-Kabir and Muhammad Bey Abu al- Dahab: 1760‚Äì1775\\". In Kushner, 1986, p. 248 As a consequence of Ali Bey's death, Zahir moved to further strengthen his hold over Jaffa and capture Jerusalem, but he failed in the latter attempt. All of Ottoman Syria came under the official command of Uthman Pasha al-Misri in 1774 in order to bring stability to the provinces of the region. Al-Misri did not seek conflict with Zahir and sought to establish friendly terms with him. As such, he convinced the Sublime Porte to officially appoint Zahir as the governor of Sidon as long as Zahir paid all of the taxes the province had owed to the Porte. Al-Misri further promoted Zahir in February by declaring him \\"Governor of Sidon, Nablus, Gaza, Ramla, Jaffa and Jabal Ajlun\\", although this title was not officially sanctioned by the Porte. In effect, Zahir was the de facto ruler over Palestine (with the exception of Nablus and Jerusalem), Jabal Amil, and the Syrian coast from Gaza to Beirut.Philipp, 2001, pp. 42‚Äì43. =Downfall and death= Zahir al-Umar's autonomous sheikhdom in 1774 Al-Misri was recalled to Istanbul in the summer of 1774 and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al-Misri. Al-Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made peace with Russia and relieving itself from that conflict, aimed to undermine the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al-Azm managed to secure an official pardon of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id,Philipp, 2001, p. 43. later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id.Philipp, 2001, p. 137 Ali continued to undermine Zahir's rule by encouraging defections by Zahir's Maghrebi mercenaries through bribes. On 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, having been encouraged by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French Caravanserai) for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon.Joudah, 1987, p. 112. Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later. They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil. Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order with the assistance of Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli.Philipp, 2001, p. 44. However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.Joudah, 1987, p. 114. On 23 April, the Porte dispatched the Ottoman Navy admiral, Hasan Pasha al-Jazayiri, to blockade Acre. He reached Haifa on 7 August taking Jaffa from Zahir's son-in-law, Karim al-Ayyubi. Hasan Pasha ordered Zahir to pay the miri dues he owed to the Sublime Porte dating back to 1768. Zahir initially agreed to pay 500,000 piasters of the total amount upfront and a further 50,000 piasters to Hasan Pasha himself to \\"spare the blood of the people\\". Hasan Pasha apparently accepted Zahir's proposals, but the arrangements fell apart. The accounts differ as to exactly how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result of disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.Joudah, 1987, p. 115. Hasan proceeded to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning fire from the city's artillerymen; al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, Zahir attempted to flee Acre on 21 or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.Joudah, 1987, p. 116. =Aftermath= Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih were arrested by Hasan Pasha's men.Joudah, 1987, p. 117. The Sublime Porte also seized property belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital along with their physician, who was known to be talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha.Thackston, 1988, pp. 17‚Äì18. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan. Zahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali continued to put up resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan Selim III as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when Napoleon invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being defeated in Acre, Abbas and Salih both left Safad with the departing French forces. This marked the end of Zaydani influence in Galilee. Constantin-Fran√ßois Volney, who wrote the first European biography of Zahir in 1787,Volney, 1788, p. 91 lists three main reasons for Zahir's failure. First, the lack of \\"internal good order and justness of principle\\". Secondly, the early concessions he made to his children. Third, and most of all, the avarice of his adviser and confidant, Ibrahim Sabbagh.Volney, 1788, p. 133 Politics =Administration= Modern, artistic representation of Zahir in Acre, Ziad Daher Zedany Zahir appointed many of his brothers and sons as local administrators, particularly after he consolidated his control over Acre,Philipp, 2001, p. 153. which became the capital of his territory. Except for Acre and Haifa, Zahir divided the remainder of his territory between his relatives. His eldest brother was appointed to Deir Hanna, and his younger brothers Yusuf and Salih Abu Dani were installed in I'billin and Arraba, respectively. Zahir appointed his eldest son Salibi as the multazim of Tiberias. Salibi was killed in 1773 fighting alongside Ali Bey's forces in Egypt.Joudah, 1987, p. 110. His death deeply distressed Zahir, who was around 80 years old at the time.Sabbagh, 2006, p. 41. He appointed Uthman in Kafr Kanna then Shefa-'Amr, Abbas in Nazareth, Ali in Safad, and Ahmad in Saffuriya. Ahmad replaced Salibi in Tiberias as well, and also conquered Ajlun and Salt in Transjordan. In addition, Ahmad was given authority over Deir Hanna after Sa'd's death. Zahir appointed his nephew Ayyub al-Karimi in Jaffa and Gaza, while al-Dinkizli was made multazim in Sidon in 1774. The appointment of Zahir's relatives and close associates was meant to ensure the efficient administration of his expanding realm and the loyalty of his circle. Among their chief functions was to ensure the supply of cotton to Acre. It is not clear if these posts were recognized by the Ottoman government. Zahir had an aide who jointly served in the capacity of mudabbir (manager) and wazir (vizier) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence.Joudah, 1987, p. 39. This official had always been a Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first wazir was Yusuf al-Arqash, followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to Malta. He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh, who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local Greek Orthodox Christian and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite. Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in Damietta, Egypt.Joudah, 1987, p. 126. Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.Joudah, 1987, p. 128. There were other officials in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti was the chief scholar among the ulama (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years at a time in contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who in the last years of his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi.Reichmuth, 2009, pp. 45‚Äì46. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa. Zahir's initial military forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen and the local inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al- Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of the remainder of his rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.Joudah, 1987, p. 129. =General security= Zahir rebuilt the Crusader-era fortress at Khirbat Jiddin According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the two principal conditions Zahir established to foster his sheikhdom's prosperity and its survival were \\"security and justice\\".Joudah, 1987, p. 37. Prior to Zahir's consolidation of power, the villages of northern Palestine were prone to Bedouin raids and robberies and the roads were under constant threat from highway robbers and Bedouin attacks. Although following the looting raids, the inhabitants of these agrarian villages were left destitute, the Ottoman provincial government would nonetheless attempt to collect from them the miri (hajj tax). To avoid punitive measures for not paying the miri, the inhabitants would abandon their villages for safety in the larger towns or the desert. This situation hurt the economy of the region as the raids sharply reduced the villages' agricultural output, the government-appointed mutasallims (tax farmers) could not collect their impositions, and trade could not be safely conducted due to insecurity on the roads. By 1746, however, Zahir had established order in the lands he ruled.Joudah, 1987, pp. 37‚Äì38. He managed to co-opt the dominant Bedouin tribe of the region, the Bani Saqr, which greatly contributed to the establishment of security in northern Palestine.Philipp, 1992, p. 94. Moreover, Zahir charged the sheikhs of the towns and villages of northern Palestine with ensuring the safety of the roads in their respective vicinity and required them to compensate anyone who was robbed of his/her property. General security reached a level whereby \\"an old woman with gold in her hand could travel from one place to another without fear or danger\\", according to biographer Mikhail Sabbagh.Joudah, 1987, p. 38. This period of calm that persisted between 1744 and 1765 greatly boosted the security and economy of Galilee. The security established in the region encouraged people from other parts of the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Galilee. Conflict between the local clans and between Zahir and his sons remained limited to periodic clashes, while there were no attacks against Zahir's domain from outside forces. While Zahir used force to strengthen his position in the region, the local inhabitants generally took comfort in his rule, which historian Thomas Philip described as \\"relatively just and reasonably fair\\". According to Richard Pococke who visited the area in 1737, the local people had great admiration for Zahir, especially for his war against bandits on the roads.Pococke, 1745, vol 2, p. 69 =Economic policies= In addition to providing security, Zahir and his local deputies adopted a policy of aiding the peasants cultivate and harvest their farmlands to further guarantee the steady supply of agricultural products for export. These benefits included loans to peasants and the distribution of free seeds. Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor.Joudah, 1987, p. 123. This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands. Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for outstanding payments the peasants owed to merchants from credit-based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment. According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir \\"had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level.\\"Philipp, 2001, p. 38. He regularly paid the Ottoman authorities their financial dues, ensuring a degree of stability in his relationship with the sultanate.Hitti, 1951, p. 688. When Zahir conquered Acre, he transformed it from a decaying village into a fortified market hub for Palestinian products, including silk, wheat, olive oil, tobacco and cotton, which he exported to Europe.Lehmann, 2014, p. 31 With cotton in particular, Zahir was able to monopolize the market for it and its foreign export. He did business with European merchants based in Galilee's ports, who competed with one another for the cotton and grain cultivated in the rural villages under Zahir's dominion or influence in Galilee's hinterland and Jabal Amil.D. Crecelius: \\"Egypt's Reawakening Interest in Palestine During the Regimes of Ali Bey al-Kabir and Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dahab: 1760‚Äì1775\\". In Kushner, 1986, p. 249 Previously, European merchants made direct transactions with local cotton growers, but Zahir, with the help of Ibrahim Sabbagh, put an end to this system of commerce by making himself the middleman between the merchants and the growers living under his rule. This allowed him to both monopolize cotton production and the merchants' price for the product.Doumani, 1995, p. 98. Zahir's designation of prices for the local cash crops also prevented \\"exploitation\\" of the peasants and local merchants by European merchants and their \\"manipulation of the prices\\", according to Joudah. This caused financial losses to the European merchants who lodged numerous complaints to the French and English ambassadors to the Sublime Porte. A formal agreement to regulate commerce between Zahir and the European merchants was reached in 1753. Zahir further encouraged trade by offering local merchants interest-free loans. The high European demand for the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his autonomous sheikhdom. This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself.Shanahan, 2005, p. 23 With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order to benefit from the customs fees he could exact.Yazbak, 1998, p. 13 The city of Acre underwent an economic boom as a result of its position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.Doumani, 1995, p. 99 =Relationship with religious minorities= St. Gabriel Church in Nazareth was built under the auspices of Zahir's rule Zahir maintained tolerant policies and encouraged the involvement of religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742,Moammar, 1990, p. 70. along with Muslims.Barnay, 1992, p. 15 Zahir did not consider Jews to be a threat to his rule and believed that their connections with the Jewish diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area.Barnay, 1992, p. 148 The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna.Sabbagh, 2006, p. 38 Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa-'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule.Barnay, 1992, p. 156 Zahir encouraged local Christian settlement in Acre,Pringle, 2009, p. 30 in order to contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing.Dumper, 2007, p. 6 Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively.Emmett, 1995, p. 22 The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768.Philipp, 2001, p. 177 Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.D. R. Khoury: \\"Political Relations Between City and State in the Middle East 1700‚Äì1850\\", in Sluglett, 2008, p. 94 Zahir allowed the Franciscan community of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with Jesus's life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth, and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest church in the city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As a testament to the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built under the auspices of Zahir's less tolerant successors. A strong relationship existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs and merchant class. Zahir maintained law and order in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skills. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their successful conflict with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab clan under Mulhim Shihab,Winter, 2010, p. 132. The relationship between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of Chouf allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the Tripoli region remained supportive of the Ottomans.Harris, 2012, p. 120 Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze emirs of Mount Lebanon, the Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the oral traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned and there was a partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River.Firro, 1992, p. 46 Family Family tree (in Arabic) from Zahir up to his modern-day descendants Zahir's clan belonged to the Qaisi political faction in the centuries-long struggle between the Qais and Yaman confederations. The Ma'an and Shihab dynasties, who ruled Mount Lebanon (and often Galilee) semi-autonomously, also belonged to the Qaisi faction.Harris, 2012, p. 113. For the most part, Zahir respected the socio-political system that prevailed in the region he ruled. The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan.Ajami, 1986, p. 54. Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables. Zahir had five wives during his lifetime.Smollet, 1783, p. 282. Among his wives was a woman from the Sardiyah, a Bedouin tribe active in Transjordan and Palestine.Joudah, 1987, p. 41 Zahir was also married to a daughter of Sayyid Muhammad, a wealthy religious notable from Damascus, a daughter of the mukhtar (headman) of Bi'ina, and a daughter of the mukhtar of Deir al-Qassi. Zahir had eight sons from his wives,Joudah, 1987, p. 139. and according to Tobias Smollett, a daughter as well. His sons, from eldest to youngest, were Salibi, Ali, Uthman, Sa'id, Ahmad, Salih, Sa'd al-Din and Abbas. His daughter's husband's name was Karim al-Ayyubi, who was also Zahir's cousin.Joudah, 1987, p. 127. By 1773, Zahir had a total of 272 children, grandchildren and great- grandchildren. As Zahir consolidated his power and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other in order to secure their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775.Joudah, 1987, p. 55. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power. Legacy The fortress of Shefa-'Amr, built by Zahir's son Uthman Zahir's rule radically changed the landscape of Galilee. With the restoration and re- fortification of Acre and the establishment of the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world.Orser, 1996, p. 473 Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.Orser, 1996, p. 474 In the late 19th century, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Claude Reignier Conder wrote that the Ottomans had successfully destroyed the power of Palestine's indigenous ruling families who \\"had practically been their own masters\\" but had been \\"ruined so that there is no longer any spirit left in them\\".Scholch, 1984, p. 474. Among these families were the \\"proud race\\" of Zahir, which was still held in high esteem, but was powerless and poor. Zahir's modern-day descendants in Galilee use the surname \\"Dhawahri\\" or \\"al-Zawahirah\\" in Zahir's honor. The Dhawahri clan constitute one of the traditional elite Muslim clans of Nazareth, alongside the Fahum, Zu'bi and 'Onallas families.Srouji, 2003, p. 187. Other villages in Galilee where descendants of Zahir's clan live are Bi'ina and Kafr Manda and, prior to its 1948 destruction, al-Damun. Many of the inhabitants of modern-day northern Israel, particularly the towns and villages where Zahir or his family left an architectural legacy, hold Zahir in high regard.Joudah, 1987, p. 118. Although he was mostly overlooked by historians of the Middle East, some scholars view Zahir's rule as a forerunner to Palestinian nationalism.Baram, 2007, p. 28 Among these scholars is Karl Sabbagh, who asserts the latter view in his book Palestine: A Personal History, which was widely reviewed in the British press in 2010. Zahir was gradually integrated into Palestinian historiography.Philipp, 2001, p. 39. In Murad Mustafa Dabbagh's Biladuna Filastin (1965), a multi-volume work about Palestine's history, Zahir is referred to as the \\"greatest Palestinian appearing in the eighteenth century\\". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) radio station, Voice of Palestine, broadcast a series about Zahir in 1966, praising him as a Palestinian national hero who fought against Ottoman imperialism. Zahir is considered by many Arab nationalists as a pioneer of Arab liberation from foreign occupation.Moammar, 1990, preface According to Joudah > However historians may look at Shaykh Zahir al-'Umar and his movement, he is > highly respected by the Arabs of the East. In particular the Palestinians > consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the > welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, > cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has > elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are > not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the > ongoing consequences of the Nakba. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh > Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a \\"little > Kingdom,\\" as Albert Hourani called it, in most of Palestine for over a > quarter of a century. =Building works= The Seraya of Nazareth, built by Zahir Zahir and his family built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and khans (caravanserais). These buildings improved the domestic administration and general security of Galilee. Today, many of these structures are in a state of disrepair and remain outside the scope of Israel's cultural preservation laws. In Acre, Zahir rebuilt the Crusader-era walls and built on top of various Crusader and Mamluk structures in the city. Among these were the caravanserais of Khan al- Shawarda and its Burj al-Sultan tower and Khan al-Shunah.Sharon, 1997, p. 28 In 1758, he commissioned the construction of the al-Muallaq Mosque in Acre.Sharon, 1997, p. 38 He also built the Seraya government house in Nazareth, which served as the city's municipal headquarters until 1991. In Haifa, which Zahir founded, he built a wall with four towers and two gates around the new settlement. Within Haifa, he built the Burj al-Salam fortress, a small mosque, a customs building, and a government residence (saraya).Yazbak, 1998, p. 15 In Tiberias, he commissioned the building of a citadel (now ruined) and the al-Amari Mosque. The latter was built with alternating white and black stone, typical of the architectural style of Zahir's building works, and a minaret. Fortifications and other structures were built in the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776.Sharon, 2004, pp. 57‚Äì58. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress with the addition of a mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.Masalha, 2013, p. 178 In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 272 Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 338 In Tibnin, in modern- day Lebanon,Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 207‚Äì208 and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 248 Zahir fortified the village of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 285 At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained standing by the 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest of its kind in Galilee.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 376‚Äì377. In the village of I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 269. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th- century, semi-autonomous Arab sheikh of Galilee.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 463.

Currently only a few kingdoms still grant nobility to people; among them Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Vatican. Depending on time and region, various laws have governed who could be ennobled and how. Typically, nobility was conferred on individuals who had assisted the sovereign. In some countries (e.g. France under the Ancien R√©gime), this degenerated into the buying of patents of nobility, whereby rich commoners (e.g. merchants) could purchase a title of nobility.  Ennobling qualities  Medieval theorists of nobility relied on earlier classical concepts (Platonic, Aristotelian and Christian-Hellenistic) of what personal traits and virtues constitute grounds for ennoblement. In Plato's Republic, he provides for promotion and degradation of citizens according to a strict spiritual meritocracy. In the words of Will Durant, \\"If the ruler's son is a dolt he falls at the first shearing; if the boot-black's son is a man of ability the way is clear for him to become a guardian of the state\\" (Durant, The Story of Philosophy, 1961, p. 28). In medieval times, heraldic writers cited biblical examples to demonstrate that nobility is not just a matter of descent but of personal virtue: Shem, Ham and Japheth sprang from the same father, yet Ham was ignoble and King David rose from shepherd to become king through sheer faith and soldierly courage. Bartolus defined natural nobility by reference to Aristotle, who in his Politics explains how some are marked out for freedom by their virtues (and specifically by their capacity to rule), and are so distinguished from the mass of men whose talents fit them only for a servile role. Those free men whose virtues thus fit them to rule Bartolus defines as the natural nobility. With regard to natural nobility, Bartolus applauded Dante Alighieri's argument in his Convivio that nobility does not derive from ancient riches adorned with fine manners, but is the meed of individual virtue. Bartolus argues that the prince should strive to make his dominion a true mirror of God's own by advancing only those who are naturally noble (see Maurice Keen, Chivalry, p. 149). Geoffroi de Charny, the noted celebrant of knighthood, argued \\"God will mark out those who labor valorously, even though they come of little estate\\" (Livre de chevalrie, in Oeuvres de Froissart, ed. K. de Lettenhove I, pt. iii, 494, 495). During the Renaissance, the Platonic- Christian humanist belief in virtue as the essence of nobility was summed up in the Latin phrase: Virtus vera nobilitas est (Virtue is the True Nobility). The counter-revolutionary author Edmund Burke wrote on merit-based promotion: \\"...the road to eminence and power, from obscure condition, ought not to be made too easy, nor a thing too much of course. If rare merit be the rarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of probation. The temple of honor ought to be seated on an eminence. If it be opened through virtue, let it be remembered, too, that virtue is never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.\\" Napoleon Bonaparte and Friedrich Nietzsche were later to continue the tradition of promoting a vision of aristocratic meritocracy, although no longer within (and opposed to) the Catholic-chivalric framework.  Kingdom of Poland  In the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, ennoblement (nobilitacja) meant an individual's joining the szlachta (Polish nobility). At first it was granted by monarch, since the late 16th century by the sejm that gave the ennobled person a coat of arms. Often that person could join an existing noble szlachta family with their own coat of arms. The increase of number of Polish nobility by trustworthy ennoblements was proportionally minimal since the 14th century. Grand Duchy of Lithuania In the late 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors‚Äîbajorai (\\"nobles\\"; see the cognate \\"boyar\\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their military service to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men (veldams). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the Lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the Go≈°tautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kƒôsgailos and others. These families were granted their coats of arms under the Union of Horod≈Ço (1413). In 1506, King Sigismund I the Old confirmed the position of the Lithuanian Council of Lords in state politics and limited entry into the nobility. Imperial Russia After the reforms of Tsar Peter the Great in the early 18th century, noblemen in Russia were obliged to serve as civil or military officials. Personal nobility was automatically conferred on all civil and military officials starting with the corresponding rank of captain. Hereditary nobility was conferred on all officials with the rank of colonel (Any given military post had an equivalent civil one, rank-wise). The system was later extended to merchants and industrialists that with a successful career managing a business of moderate size would achieve personal or hereditary nobility.

These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm.  Major ecosystems  Within the Holarctic realm, there are a variety of ecosystems. The type of ecosystem found in an area depends on the latitude and local geography. In the far north, a band of arctic tundra circles the shore of the Arctic Ocean. The ground beneath this land is permafrost, frozen year- round. In these difficult growing conditions, few plants can survive. South of the tundra, the boreal forest stretches across North America and Eurasia. This land is characterized by coniferous trees. South of here, the ecosystems become more diverse. Some areas are covered in temperate grassland, while others are covered in temperate forest, dominated by deciduous trees. The southern extent of the Holarctic typically reaches into the desert, which is dominated by plants and animals adapted to the dry conditions (Schultz 2007).  Species with a Holarctic distribution  A variety of animal species are distributed across continents, throughout much of the Holarctic realm. These include the brown bear, grey wolf, red fox, wolverine, moose, caribou, golden eagle and common raven. The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is found in mountainous and semi-open areas distributed throughout the Holarctic. It once occupied much larger areas, but has been driven out by human development and the resulting habitat fragmentation. Today it is only found in remaining wilderness areas. The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is found in a wide variety of habitats from tundra to desert, with different populations adapted for each. Its historical distribution encompasses the vast majority of the Holarctic realm, though human activities such as development and active extermination have extirpated the species from much of this range. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a highly adaptable predator. It has the widest distribution of any terrestrial carnivore, and is adapted to a wide range of habitats, including areas of intense human development. Like the wolf, it is distributed throughout the majority of the Holarctic, but it has avoided extirpation. The wolverine (Gulo gulo) is a large member of the weasel family found primarily in the arctic and in boreal forests, ranging south in mountainous regions. It is distributed in such areas throughout Eurasia and North America. The moose (Alces alces) is the largest member of the deer family. It is found throughout most of the boreal forest through continental Eurasia into Scandinavia, eastern North America, and boreal and montane regions of western North America. In some areas it ranges south into the deciduous forest. The caribou, or reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is found in boreal forest and tundra in the northern parts of the Holarctic. In Eurasia it has been domesticated. It is divided into several subspecies, which are adapted to different habitats and geographic areas. The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best- known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels). The common raven (Corvus corax) is the most widespread of the corvids, and one of the largest. It is found in a variety of habitats, but primarily wooded northern areas. It has been known to adapt well to areas of human activity. Their distribution also makes up most of the Holarctic realm. Leptothorax acervorum is a small red Holarctic ant widely distributed across Eurasia, ranging from central Spain and Italy to the northernmost parts of Scandinavia and Siberia.  Origin  The continuity of the northern parts of the Holarctic results from their shared glacial history. During the Pleistocene, these areas were subjected to repeated glaciations. Icecaps expanded, scouring the land of life and reshaping its topography. During glacial periods, species survived in refugia, small areas that maintained a suitable climate due to local geography. These areas are believed to have been primarily in southern regions, but some genetic and paleontological evidence points to additional refugia in the sheltered areas of the north (Stewart and Lister 2001). Wherever these areas were found, they became source populations during interglacial periods. When the glaciers receded, plants and animals spread rapidly into the newly opened areas. Different taxa responded to these rapidly changing conditions in different ways. Tree species spread outward from refugia during interglacial periods, but in varied patterns, with different trees dominating in different periods (Taberlet and Chedadi 2002). Insects, on the other hand, shifted their ranges with the climate, maintaining consistency in species for the most part throughout the period (Coope 1994). Their high degree of mobility allowed them to move as the glaciers advanced or retreated, maintaining a constant habitat despite the climatic oscillations. Despite their apparent lack of mobility, plants managed to colonize new areas rapidly as well. Studies of fossil pollen indicate that trees recolonized these lands at an exponential rate (Bennet 1986). Mammals recolonized at varying rates. Brown bears, for instance, moved quickly from refugia with the receding glaciers, becoming one of the first large mammals to recolonize the land (Sommer and Benecke 2005). The last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago, resulting in the present distribution of ecoregions. Another factor contributing to the continuity of Holarctic ecosystems is the movement between continents allowed by the Bering land bridge, which was exposed by the lowering of sea level due to the expansion of the ice caps. The communities found in the Palearctic and the Nearctic are different, but have many species in common. This is the result of several faunal interchanges that took place across the Bering land bridge. However, these migrations were mostly limited to large, cold-tolerant species (Rodriguez et al. 2006). Today it is mainly these species which are found throughout the realm.  Threats  As the Holarctic is an enormous area, it is subject to environmental problems of international scale. The primary threats throughout the region result from global warming and habitat fragmentation. The former is of particular concern in the north, as these ecosystems are adapted to cold. The latter is more of a concern in the south, where development is prevalent. Global warming is a threat to all the Earth's ecosystems, but it is a more immediate threat to those found in cold climates. The communities of species found at these latitudes are adapted to the cold, so any significant warming can upset the balance. For instance, insects struggle to survive the cold winters typical of the boreal forest. Many do not make it, especially in harsh winters. However, recently the winters have grown milder, which has had a drastic effect on the forest. Winter mortality of some insect species drastically decreased, allowing the population to build on itself in subsequent years. In some areas the effects have been severe. Spruce beetle outbreaks have wiped out up to ninety percent of the Kenai Peninsula's spruce trees; this is blamed primarily on a series of unusually warm years since 1987 (Logan et al. 2003). In this case a native species has caused massive disturbance of habitat as a result of climate change. Warming temperatures may also allow pest species to enlarge their range, moving into habitats that were previously unsuitable. Studies of potential areas for outbreaks of bark beetles indicate that as the climate shifts, these beetles will expand to the north and to higher elevations than they have previously affected (Williams & Liebhold 2002). With warmer temperatures, insect infestation will become a greater problem throughout the northern parts of the Holarctic. Another potential effect of global warming to northern ecosystems is the melting of permafrost. This can have significant effects on the plant communities that are adapted to the frozen soil, and may also have implications for further climate change. As permafrost melts, any trees growing above it may die, and the land shifts from forest to peatland. In the far north, shrubs may later take over what was formerly tundra. The precise effect depends on whether the water that was locked up is able to drain off. In either case, the habitat will undergo a shift. Melting permafrost may also accelerate climate change in the future. Within the permafrost, vast quantities of carbon are locked up. If this soil melts, the carbon may be released into the air as either carbon dioxide or methane. Both of these are greenhouse gases (Stokstad 2004). Habitat fragmentation threatens a wide variety of habitats throughout the world, and the Holarctic is no exception. Fragmentation has a variety of negative effects on populations. As populations become cut off, their genetic diversity suffers and they become susceptible to sudden disasters and extinction. While the northern parts of the Holarctic represent some of the largest areas of wilderness left on Earth, the southern parts are in some places extensively developed. This realm contains most of the worlds developed countries, including the United States and the nations of Western Europe. Temperate forests were the primary ecosystem in many of the most developed areas today. These lands are now used for intensive agriculture or have become urbanized. As lands have been developed for agricultural uses and human occupation, natural habitat has for the most part become limited to areas considered unsuitable for human use, such as slopes or rocky areas (Schultz 2007). This pattern of development limits the ability of animals, especially large ones, to migrate from place to place. Large carnivores are particularly affected by habitat fragmentation. These mammals, such as brown bears and wolves, require large areas of land with relatively intact habitat to survive as individuals. Much larger areas are required to maintain a sustainable population. They may also serve as keystone species, regulating the populations of the species they prey on. Thus, their conservation has direct implications for a wide range of species, and is difficult to accomplish politically due to the large size of the areas they need (Paquet 1996). With increasing development, these species in particular are at risk, which could have effects that carry down throughout the ecosystem.  Conservation actions  The threats to the Holarctic realm are not going unrecognized. Many efforts are being made to mitigate these threats, with the hope of preserving the biodiversity of the region. International agreements to combat global warming may help to lessen the effects of climate change on this region. Efforts are also underway to fight habitat fragmentation, both on local and regional scales. The most comprehensive effort to combat global warming to date is the Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries who sign this protocol agree to cut their collective greenhouse gas emissions by five percent since 1990 by sometime between 2008 and 2012. The vast majority of these nations are found within the Holarctic. Each country is given a target for emission levels, and they may trade emissions credits in a market-based system that includes developing countries as well. Once this period is ended, a new agreement will be written to further mitigate the effects of climate change. The process of drafting a new agreement has already begun. In late 2007, an international meeting in Bali was held to begin planning for the successor to the Kyoto Protocol. This agreement will aim to build on the successes and failures of Kyoto to produce a more effective method of cutting greenhouse gas emissions (UNFCCC). If these efforts are successful, the biodiversity of the Holarctic and the rest of the world will see fewer effects of climate change. Fighting habitat fragmentation is a major challenge in conserving the wide-ranging species of the Holarctic. Some efforts are limited to a local scale of protection, while others are regional in scope. Local efforts include creating reserves and establishing safe routes for animals to cross roads and other human-made barriers. Regional efforts to combat habitat fragmentation take a broader scope. One major such effort in the Holarctic is the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. This organization was started in 1997 to help establish a contiguous network of protection for the northern Rocky Mountains, from mid Wyoming to the border between Alaska and Canada's Yukon. It brings together a wide variety of environmental organizations for a shared purpose. The goal of the Initiative is to create a core of protected areas, connected by corridors and surrounded by buffer zones. This will build on the many existing protected areas in this region, with a focus on integrating existing and future human activities into the conservation plan rather than seeking to exclude them (Yellowstone to Yukon). If these efforts are successful, they will be especially beneficial to wide-ranging species such as grizzly bears. If these species can survive, other members of the communities they live in will survive as well.  References  * Bennet, K. D.; J. H. Lawton; A. Gibbs; M. H. Williamson; M. W. Holdgate; W. D.

His early paintings were influenced by cubism, futurism and vorticism. From an early age, he clearly had access to great wealth as his accommodation from 1910 is listed as 28 Queen Street, one of the most prestigious addresses in Edinburgh, and not affordable to the average art student.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1910‚Äì11 During First World War he served as an officer in 1st Battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and served in The Battle of the Somme, Amiens and Abbeville. The conditions in the trenches brought on bronchitis and asthma, and he was invalided out to convalesce in the South of France. After recuperating, he returned to the Battalion's base, but was once again hospitalised and in danger of becoming 'unfit for service'. However he managed to continue service by transferring to the 4th Field Ordnance Survey Battalion at 4th Army Headquarters and developed new and faster methods for processing aerial photographs. In particular, he devised a clever method of projecting the photographic negative taken from a spotter plane which replicated the tilt present when the photograph was taken ‚Äì the technique of single photo-optical rectification. This greatly speeded up the process of rapid fixing of enemy gun emplacements. During the War, he also learned to use radio (becoming President of the Edinburgh Radio Society).A Chasm in Time ‚Äì Scottish War Art and Artists in the Twentieth Century, by Patricia R. Andrew, Birlinn Ltd., 2014. He was Mentioned in Dispatches twice and received a military OBE. During the Second World War he initially worked at the Ordnance Survey Department in Southampton (1939‚Äì40) and then moved to the same organisation in Edinburgh (1940‚Äì1945). He received a military CBE in 1948.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf After the First World War he adopted a more realist style. Cursiter became an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1927, a full Academician in 1937 and served as Secretary to the Academy from 1953 to 1955. He was the first Secretary of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and was appointed Keeper of the National Galleries of Scotland in 1930, a post he held until 1948. That same year, he was granted the Freedom of Kirkwall and was appointed as the King's (later to be Queen's) Painter and Limner for Scotland, a position he held until his death. He painted watercolour landscapes of East Lothian, Orkney and Shetland, and designed Saint Rognvald Chapel in St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. He is particularly renowned for his portraits and is considered amongst the finest Scottish portraitists of the 20th Century. He painted 'Her Majesty The Queen receiving the Honours of Scotland' in the High Kirk of St Giles in 1953, this painting hangs on the Great Stair, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh. Aberdeen University awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1959. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1938, a rare accolade for an artist.

WLTW is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts from studios in the former AT&T; Building in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan; its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. History The station first went on the air on January 1, 1961 as WRVR, originally owned by the Riverside Church. WRVR played classical music and some jazz, along with religious programming and public affairs. As time went on, WRVR was a full-time jazz station with a strong audience following but low ratings. In mid-1974 Riverside Church looked to cut its losses and sell WRVR, but with a preferred condition that the station's jazz format be preserved. At the same time, classical music-formatted WNCN (104.3 FM, now sister station WAXQ) was in the process of a controversial format change to Album oriented rock, with new call letters WQIV. A group of WNCN audience members formed the non-profit WNCN Listeners Guild and attempted to block the station's then-owner, Starr Broadcasting, from making the format switch. After their efforts failed, the WNCN Listeners Guild partnered with GAF Corporation and briefly entered negotiations with Riverside Church to purchase WRVR and switch its programming to classical. The rock format on 104.3 FM would last less than a year, as GAF announced it would purchase WQIV in July 1975 and restore 104.3 FM to its former call sign and programming.\\"Classical-music fans win out in New York.\\" Broadcasting, August 25, 1975, pp. 62, 64. Accessed March 3, 2019. As the WNCN/WQIV drama concluded, Sonderling Broadcasting stepped in and bought WRVR from Riverside Church for just over $2 million. Sonderling already owned WWRL (1600 AM), and hoped that it could move WWRL's Urban contemporary format to FM as a counter- move against WBLS (107.5 FM), which had cut into WWRL's ratings. Like the WNCN/WQIV situation, community opposition tried to stop sale of the station. Sonderling ultimately took control of WRVR in October 1976 after over a year of delays.\\"FCC gives green-light to sale of NY stations.\\" Broadcasting, November 1, 1976, pp. 55-56. Accessed March 3, 2019. The listeners' protests did prevent the proposed change, and WRVR remained a jazz station under Sonderling ownership. At that time it developed the precursor to what would later become known as the \\"smooth jazz\\" format. While it played Jazz music, it was allowed to report to Radio & Records Album Oriented Rock chart in the mid to late 1970s. =1980s= In 1978 Viacom announced it was purchasing the Sonderling chain,\\"Viacom, Sonderling propose marriage.\\" Broadcasting, March 20, 1978, pp. 33-34. Accessed April 2, 2019. a sale which took a year-and-a- half to become final. When Viacom took over in 1980, the call letters were changed to WKHK and the station adopted a country music format known as \\"Kick 106.7 FM\\". The format change took place in the middle of the night and brought many protests from New York jazz fans, who petitioned the FCC to deny the station's license renewal; ultimately the petition was denied. WKHK would suffer from low ratings, as they were unable to compete with WHN (1050 AM), which also had a country music format at the time. On January 23, 1984, Viacom dropped country music and turned 106.7 into an MOR station‚Äìwith new call letters WLTW and on-air branding of \\"Lite FM\\". Initially they were an easy listening station without anything that would be classified as \\"elevator music\\". At this point, the station played music from such artists as Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Kenny Rogers, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams, Barry Manilow, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor, and the Stylistics. The station also played softer songs from such artists as Elton John, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Everly Brothers, the Righteous Brothers and Billy Joel. The station wouldn't play any new music except for new songs by artists that were familiar to listeners of the station. With this format change, ratings did increase from its previously low levels. By the late 1980s, WLTW started to play songs from such artists as Whitney Houston, Chicago, Foreigner, the Doobie Brothers and Bruce Springsteen. As other competing New York City stations changed their focus, the station stayed with their soft adult contemporary format, even though they were phasing out songs from artists such as Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, and the Carpenters. At this point, the station's ratings were at or near the top compared with other New York City radio stations. =1990s= By the mid-1990s, with WPAT-FM adapting a Spanish adult contemporary format, WPLJ adapting a hot adult contemporary format, and WMXV switching to a modern adult contemporary format, WLTW segued to a mainstream adult contemporary format with a more uptempo direction than before, and phased out the majority of its soft adult contemporary material. =Merger with Clear Channel Communications= The station's logo used from 1995 to 2009 Chancellor bought WLTW and the rest of Viacom's radio group in 1997.Rathburn, Elizabeth A. and Donna Petrozzello. \\"Hicks's sticks hit 267.\\" Broadcasting and Cable, February 24, 1997, pp. 6, 8. Accessed March 3, 2019. In 1999 Chancellor merged with Capstar to form AM/FM, which retained WLTW. Finally, in 2000, AM/FM merged with Clear Channel Communications, which became iHeartMedia in 2014. (Of note, Viacom would not be out of the radio business for long, for when they bought CBS, they also bought their radio properties, which were owned by the radio subsidiary Infinity Broadcasting - which owned WLTW's future competitor, WNEW-FM.) WLTW was simulcast nationwide on XM Satellite Radio from 2001 to the end of 2003, under the channel name \\"Lite.\\" WLTW on XM was replaced by The Blend on February 2, 2004. In 2004, all XM music channels went commercial free, and WLTW was replaced with a unique-to-XM channel called Sunny, which had an easy listening format. Since then, Clear Channel has regained the right to air commercials on their XM music channels. Sunny then began carrying commercials, but was still exclusive to XM. After a few format tweaks, Sunny played soft oldies until it became The Pink Channel. During the holiday season (Thanksgiving through Christmas), WLTW has played Christmas music interspersed with its regular playlist. Only on Christmas Day and a few days leading up to it would the station devote all its airtime to holiday music. After the September 11 attacks, Christmas music was seen as a comforting \\"feel-good\\" format for radio listeners. Already established as a popular station for Christmas music, WLTW began to switch to an all-Christmas format earlier in 2002. After retaining its leadership in market share, and as part of a national trend, the station continued to make the switch earlier in the following years. By 2004, the all-Christmas format ran from Thanksgiving through Christmas, and in 2005, it began on November 18, the week before Thanksgiving (November 24). By all accounts, the gamble paid off; WLTW captured 7.4% of the New York radio audience during the fall of 2005‚Äîthe biggest market share in WLTW's history and the highest share for all New York stations since the winter of 1995. On November 18, 2006, for the 2nd year in a row the station switched to all Christmas music on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, becoming the first NYC Station to do so. They did so the same day as WALK-FM, a Long Island-based station which shares a good portion of their listening audience. At some points during the 2008 holiday season, WLTW would draw as much as a third of all radio listeners in the New York area. WLTW usually switches to Christmas music on the Friday before Thanksgiving, like it did in recent years. However, this did not occur in 2019, when the station decided to switch to Christmas music on November 15, instead of November 22, which was the Friday before Thanksgiving. =Since 2006= As part of Clear Channel's nationwide cost-cutting efforts, WLTW fired station veterans Bill Buchner (mornings) and J.J. Kennedy (evenings) on November 6, 2006. Buchner was replaced with Karen Carson, who co-hosted mornings with fellow WLTW staffer Christine Nagy. WLTW Program Director Jim Ryan has denied these firings were part of the company's cost cutting that were going on at all the other Clear Channel stations in preparation for their conversion the leveraged buyout that took the company from public to private ownership in 2006, but rather from their desire to improve ratings. The syndicated Delilah show, distributed by sister company Premiere Radio Networks, replaced Kennedy's local evening lovesongs show on November 20, 2006, bringing the syndicated show to the full New York market for the first time. Prior to WLTW picking her show up, Delilah was only heard in outer portions of the New York market from stations in neighboring areas, such as WEZN-FM. In a departure from her normal format, Delilah and her syndicator are allowing Ryan to program the music on the WLTW's version of Delilah, instead of the selections that are sent to her other affiliates. On April 2, 2007, just after April Fool's Day, WLTW removed the \\"Lite\\" branding and was simply known as \\"New York's 106.7.\\" This probably took place in reaction to the \\"Lite\\" brand being associated with an older demographic turning away the younger listeners, as well as increased competition from the new Fresh 102.7. Later in 2007, the Lite-FM branding returned on the station. This was true even though WLTW played \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" by Bon Jovi and \\"Crazy\\" by Gnarls Barkley, just like with most AC stations today. By 2009, most of the hot AC content was toned down in order for competitor WWFS' (now WNEW-FM) shift from hot AC to adult contemporary. In 2011, WWFS switched panels to the hot adult contemporary panel from the adult contemporary panel on Nielsen BDS and later Mediabase, giving WWFS more format similarity to rival WPLJ (owned by Cumulus Media) rather than WLTW or its rimshot rivals (WNBM/WFAF, WKJY or WMGQ, the latter two on 98.3 FM). Further cost-cutting efforts by Clear Channel caused the departure of longtime station favorites Al \\"Bernie\\" Berstein and Valerie Smaldone in early 2008. It was also announced that Program Director Jim Ryan would exit as of May 2008. Chris Conley took over the Program Director Position. Mr. Conley was a programming consultant with McVay Media and long time programming veteran with years in the Adult Contemporary radio format. Chris had a very successful tenure at WBEB B101 FM in Philadelphia. Recently, in addition to his programming duties at WLTW-FM, Mr. Conley has been overseeing programming at sister station WKTU The Beat Of New York. Ms. Morgan Prue, winner of several Music Director Of The Year Awards, stayed on as the station's Music Director and Assistant Program Director Upon Ms. Prue's departure, to pursue a program directorship in Canada, Ms. Jillian Kempton was named Assistant Program Director/Music Director. Jill is now the program director of sister station, in Washington DC, WASH-FM and Ms. Cara Hahn has stepped into the Assistant Program Director role, which she also holds at New York sister station WHTZ. Lite FM has evolved into a more upbeat \\"Variety\\" station from its earlier \\"Soft Rock\\" approach with deejays talking over intros, keeping a non stop music flow, and has added a jingle package for the first time in the history of the station. The station uses Reelworld One AC with its own logo. The station is also well known for having somewhat of a lean toward Rhythmic AC compared to most other AC stations owned by Clear Channel, possibly due to the younger-leaning audience in the NY market. In May 2011, WLTW returned to XM Satellite Radio, with a full-time simulcast on Channel 13. However, station owner Clear Channel sold off its ownership stake in Sirius XM Radio during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. As a result of the sale, nine of Clear Channel's eleven XM stations, including the simulcast of WLTW, ceased broadcast over XM Satellite Radio on October 18, 2013. A link to 106.7 FM's days as Riverside Church-owned WRVR remains on WLTW in the present day. A recorded sermon from Riverside Church airs on the station at 5:00 AM on Sunday mornings, as part of WLTW's non-music public affairs programming. Ratings As a mainstream adult contemporary station, WLTW has historically been one of the top radio stations in New York City. In March 2012, the station finished first with a 7.5 share in the Nielsen Audio numbers, with WCBS-FM and WHTZ-FM finishing in second and third respectively. WLTW's audience also grows when it switches to Christmas music for the holiday season; in 2017, the station's ratings share increased to 8.8 at the beginning of the season, an increase of .5 year-over-year.

Career =Background= In early 1989, Teddy Long was a referee for the National Wrestling Alliance, but due to a series of questionable calls, including one that cost the Road Warriors their world tag-team titles Teddy Long was fired and took up managing instead. =First incarnation= Long paired Dan Spivey with Sid Vicious, two people who had recently signed with the federation and gave them the name ‚ÄúThe Skyscrapers‚Äù due to their height. The Skyscrapers‚Äô first taste of success came at the 1989 Great American Bash PPV where they first co-won a Two-Ring King of the Hill Battle Royal with Sid being the survivor in one ring and Dan surviving in the other. The rules called for the two to fight each other but manager Teddy Long convinced them to shake hands and share the prize money before getting on the microphone and telling the crowd that what they had that the other tag teams didn't have was unity. Later in the night the Skyscrapers defeated The Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace and Shane Douglas) due to their overwhelming size and power. The Skyscrapers quickly became involved in a feud with the Road Warriors, sparked by Teddy Long's actions while still a referee. The two teams were very evenly matched in power and intensity creating a series of matches that did not favor one team over the other. Spivey and Vicious were disqualified against the Road Warriors at Halloween Havoc 1989 but neither team looked like losers on the night. Shortly after Halloween Havoc the Skyscrapers faced the Steiner Brothers at Clash of the Champions IX in a hard hitting match. A match that was so hard hitting in fact that Sid Vicious suffered a punctured lung due to a broken rib. =Second incarnation= With Vicious out of action Teddy Long brought in another tall () newcomer in the same mold as Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey and dubbed him ‚ÄùMean‚Äù Mark Callous. The New Skyscrapers immediately picked up the feud with the Road Warriors and kept on having inconclusive matches with them. At Clash of the Champions X the Skyscrapers finally got the better of the Road Warriors, not in the match but afterwards when they beat the Road Warriors down. At this point in time no one had ever been able to physically dominate the Road Warriors, something that pointed that big things had been planned for the Skyscrapers. But big things never happened, in the days before the scheduled Chicago Street Fight at WrestleWar 1990 Dan Spivey suddenly left WCW leaving the bookers to scramble for a replacement. Exactly why he left the federation so suddenly has never been stated. =Third incarnation= Instead of cancelling the announced match the bookers turned to Mike Enos, who was working for the American Wrestling Association at the time, and put him under a mask as The Masked Skyscraper. The Road Warriors made short work of Callous and the Masked Skyscraper ending the feud and ending the Skyscrapers run of domination. Callous decided to go on his own for a while but failed in a challenge to WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger. He then quit and joined the WWF, where he became known as The Undertaker. =Reunited originals= By the end of 1990 Dan Spivey and the WCW worked out whatever differences that caused Spivey to leave in the spring and Spivey returned to WCW television. The Skyscrapers briefly reunited at Starrcade 1990 as he and Sid Vicious took on and beat The Big Cat and The Motor City Madman. The match was the only time Spivey and Vicious teamed up to reform the original Sky- Scrapers Aftermath In the WWF/E, Sid Vicious and Mean Mark Callous feuded with each other several times; they would wrestle each other at WrestleMania 13 for the WWF Championship, with Sid Vicious as the WWF Champion Sycho Sid and Mean Mark Callous as The Undertaker, where The Undertaker won the match and the Championship. Before becoming a Skyscraper, Spivey had wrestled as \\"Golden Boy\\" Danny Spivey in the WWF from 1985‚Äì88 in a gimmick where with his blonde hair, height and build, yellow trunks and yellow boots saw him labelled by fans as a clone of then WWF Champion Hulk Hogan. He returned to the WWF in 1995 under the name Waylon Mercy, this time with jet black hair, but was used as a jobber-to-the-stars and ended up retiring later in the year. In between his WCW stint and second WWF stint as Mercy he competed in All Japan Pro Wrestling, winning the World Tag Team Championship once with another early 1990s WCW figure, Stan Hansen. As for the Masked Skyscraper (Mike Enos), he and his Destruction Crew teammate Wayne Bloom made their way to the WWF in 1991 as Beau (Bloom) and Blake (Enos) Beverly, the Beverly Brothers. Enos also later toured Japan, though with New Japan Pro Wrestling, where Vicious had once challenged for their title in the 1980s.

It won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1991 and was adapted to a 1997 film of the same name. The novel is a modernized retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear and is set on a thousand- acre (four hundred hectares) farm in Iowa that is owned by a family of a father and his three daughters. It is told through the point of view of the oldest daughter, Ginny. Plot summary Larry Cook is an aging farmer who decides to incorporate his farm, handing complete and joint ownership to his three daughters, Ginny, Rose, and Caroline. When the youngest daughter objects, she is removed from the agreement. This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long-suppressed emotions, as the story eventually reveals the long-term sexual abuse of the two eldest daughters that was committed by their father. The plot also focuses on Ginny's troubled marriage, her difficulties in bearing a child and her relationship with her family. Similarities to King Lear There are many similarities between King Lear and A Thousand Acres, including both plot details and character development. For example, some of the names of the main characters in the novel are reminiscent of their Shakespearean counterparts. Larry is Lear, Ginny is Goneril, Rose is Regan, and Caroline is Cordelia. The role of the Cooks' neighbors, Harold Clark and his sons Loren and Jess, also rework the importance of Gloucester, Edgar and Edmund in King Lear.

Azuchi Castle was built from 1576 to 1579 on Mount Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa in ≈åmi Province. Nobunaga intentionally built Azuchi Castle close enough to Kyoto that he could watch over and guard the approaches to the capital, but outside Kyoto so his fortress would be immune to the fires and conflicts that occasionally consumed the city. Azuchi Castle's location was also strategically advantageous in managing the communications and transportation routes between Nobunaga's greatest foes ‚Äì the Uesugi to the north, the Takeda in the east, and the M≈çri to the west.≈årui, N. and M. Toba (1935). _Castles in Japan_. Tokyo: Board of Tourist Industry & Japan Government Railways. Azuchi Castle was demolished in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide after his assassination of Nobunaga in the Honno-ji Incident. The Azuchi-Momoyama period of Japanese history partially takes its name from Azuchi Castle. History Niwa Nagahide had responsibility for constructing the castle, which began in 1576 and completed in 1579. Unlike earlier castles and fortresses, Azuchi was not intended to be a military structure alone, cold, dark, and foreboding. Nobunaga intended it as a mansion which would impress and intimidate his rivals not only with its defenses, but also with its lavish apartments and decorations, flourishing town, and religious life. The keep, called tenshu (or tenshukaku), rather than being the center of the castle's defences, was a seven-story building containing audience halls, private chambers, offices, and a treasury, as though it were a royal palace. All seven stories were decorated by Kan≈ç Eitoku. In addition to being one of the first Japanese castles with a tower keep, Azuchi was unique in that its uppermost story was octagonal. In addition, the facade of Azuchi, unlike the solid white or black of other castles, was colorfully decorated with tigers and dragons. There were five main militaristic features of Azuchi Castle that differentiated it from earlier castle designs. Firstly, it was a massive structure, with the walls of the castle ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 meters in thickness. The second feature of Azuchi Castle is the predominant use of stone. The walls were constructed from huge granite stones fitted carefully together without the use of mortar. A third innovation of the Azuchi Castle was the high central tower, or donjon. The tower allowed for increased visibility for the use of guns against an opposing force. Builder‚Äôs plans for the castle show the donjon to be 40 meters, with seven levels. Fourthly, Azuchi Castle had irregularly formed inner citadels. These inner citadels gave defenders ample defensive positions against intruders. Nobunaga chose Azuchi-yama for the location of Azuchi Castle, which rises 100 meters above Lake Biwa. The site was strategically placed at the intersection of three highways converging on Kyoto from the east. Nobunaga desired a full castle town, and built well-defended homes for his generals, a J≈çdo-sh≈´ Buddhist temple called J≈çgon-in, and a number of homes for commoners a short distance away on the shore of the lake. He had trouble convincing people to move into these homes at first, however. In the summer of 1577, he issued a municipal charter, guaranteeing residents immunity from taxes, building or transport levies, and moratoria, and forced all travelers on the Nakasend≈ç highway to stop in the town overnight for lodging, thus bringing business to his town's innkeepers. By 1582, the town's inhabitants numbered roughly 5,000. In addition to welcoming many of Nobunaga's powerful political guests, such as Tokugawa Ieyasu and Niwa Nagahide, Azuchi castle also hosted an event in 1579 which has come to be known as the Azuchi religious debate (ÂÆâÂúüÂÆóË´ñ, Azuchi sh≈´ron), taking place between leaders of the Nichiren and J≈çdo-sh≈´ sects of Buddhism. In the summer of 1582, just after Nobunaga's death at Honn≈ç-ji, the castle was taken over by the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide, Nobunaga's betrayer. The castle was set aflame a week or so later, with some accounts claiming this might have been the work of looting townspeople, or of one of Nobunaga's sons. The Azuchi-Momoyama Period of Japanese history takes its name, in part, from this castle. Architecture and design In 1976, the Japanese architectural historian Akira Nait≈ç published what he believed to be a conclusive summary of the features of Azuchi Castle. He concluded that the tenshu was 46 meters in height, with a gilded octagonal belvedere on top. An atrium rose from the basement level to the fourth floor ceiling, supposedly influenced by the Jesuits, but with a stupa at the atrium floor center. However, the external design of Azuchi Castle is still debated. Another Japanese Architectural Historian, Miyakami Shigetaka, has accused Nait≈ç of failing to corroborate his theory with enough documentation. All that remains of the castle today is the stone base. However, an approximate reproduction of Azuchi, based on illustrations and historical descriptions, stands in Ise Sengoku Village, a samurai theme park near Ise. In addition, a full-scale replica of the top floors of the donjon is on display at the Nobunaga no Yakata Museum near the original castle ruins.

He is noted for Westland's wartime aeroplanes, the Canberra, the early design of the Lightning, and his last plane, the Folland Gnat. Early life Westland Aircraft factory site in Yeovil in Somerset Edward 'Teddy' Petter was the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of Sir Ernest Petter (co-founder of Westland Aircraft Works) and his wife, Angela Emma. For the origin of this Petter family in North Devon, see \\"Some men who made Barnstaple...\\" Pauline Brain 2010 Because his father spent much time in London, Teddy's early childhood was spent mostly with his mother, from whom he inherited a strong religious conviction and firm ethical principles. He was educated at Marlborough College in Wiltshire then Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. During his first two years at Cambridge he focused his studies on subjects relevant to oil engines, the traditional product of Petters Limited, but in his third year he concentrated on aerodynamics and aircraft engineering. In 1929 he was awarded a first class in the mechanical sciences tripos and shared the John Bernard Seely prize in aeronautics. Career =Westland= Early career Petter joined Westland Aircraft Works as a graduate apprentice in 1929 and for the next 2 1/2 years he worked in every department, not seeking any favour despite being the chairman's son. In the drawing office it was noted that he was a very poor draftsman but had good ideas. Years later he said \\"I looked on this as sheer drudgery at the time, but knew afterwards that without workshop knowledge I would never have become a designer\\". In May 1932 he was appointed personal assistant to the managing director, Robert Bruce, a position previously held by Petter's friend and colleague Harald Penrose. Bruce did not welcome the appointment and ignored him, leaving Petter spare time to modify and compete an Austin 7. Despite his interest in sports cars, Petter had no interest in learning to fly. Penrose gave him a flying lesson at this time, but later commented that Petter had a 'lack of the requisite sensitivity coupled with hopeless judgment of speed and distance'. His father appointed Petter to the board in May 1934, making him technical director (at the age of 26) in preference over more experienced engineers such as Arthur Davenport and Geoffery Hill. This was not welcomed by the older members of the management, ultimately prompting Bruce and Hill to resign, and placing the older and more experienced Davenport in an intolerable position as his subordinate. One of his first actions as technical director was to terminate development of Hill's Pterodactyl, a pioneering tailless swept-wing aircraft. However, other business decisions by Ernest Petter infuriated Teddy. In July 1935 Ernest Petter convened a shareholders meeting to propose a merger with British Marine Aircraft for the purpose of expanding Westland's workshops.Ironically, British Marine Aircraft would become Folland Aircraft in 1937 This proposal was thwarted by Teddy and Peter Acland who threatened to resign. But in July 1938 Ernest Petter sold the controlling shares in Westlands to John Brown Ltd, forming Westland Aircraft Limited as a separate company, with Eric Mensforth brought in to share the managing directorship with Peter Acland. Teddy saw the loss of family control of the company as the loss of his birthright, and this dispute would divide the Petter family for years, not being resolved until shortly before Ernest Petter's death in 1954. Lysander NASM in Washington DC The Air Ministry was initially reluctant to award Westland contracts due to Petter's inexperience, but his reputation as a successful designer was strengthened after it was demonstrated that the automatic slats on the PV 7 were both effective and reliable. As a result, and after internal discussion, the Air Ministry added Westland to the list of bidders for Specification A.39/34 (the replacement for the Hawker Hector army co-operation aircraft). Petter started the design by interviewing the Army Cooperation pilots and ground crew. Based on this information, he placed pilot visibility, the ability to take off and land in small spaces, and ease of ground maintenance as the prime requirements. The resulting design, the Westland P8 (later named the Lysander), was clearly an evolution of Westland's high-winged monoplane designs, but Petter incorporated a number of innovative features including extensive use of extruded sections throughout the airframe, something that would be a feature in his future designs. The early flight testing revealed attitude control problems that the wind tunnel tests had not predicted. Petter instructed Penrose to conceal these problems from Ernest Petter. Later, when these problem had been addressed by a larger, variable-incidence tailplane, it was realised that if a landing was aborted and the throttles opened up fully, the Lysander could rear up and stall. While Penrose and RAF test pilots lobbied for modifications, Petter refused because redesign would affect production. Also, in his zeal to reduce weight, Petter had used glider fabric instead of specification Irish linen to cover the wings on the second prototype. This nearly caused a disaster when an RAF Pilot dived it to the limit, causing the fabric on the top surface to tear off. Whirlwind Westland Whirlwind Petter's next fixed-wing aircraft design was a radical departure from the Westland's typical high-wing fabric-covered airframe. The Westland P9 was a low winged twin-engined aircraft employing the latest technology. It was designed to meet Air Ministry specification F.37/35, which called for a single-seat cannon-armed fighter, at least 40 mph faster than a contemporary bomber and not less than 330 mph at 15,000 ft. To obtain this performance Petter and Davenport chose to minimise drag; the two Rolls- Royce Peregrine engines were fitted in closely streamlined nacelles, and their radiators were fitted inside the wing inboard sections (something that would be later copied in the de Havilland Mosquito and the Hawker Tempest I). In the two prototypes the engine exhaust was routed through the fuel tanks in the wings to reduce parasitic drag. The Air Ministry thought that this was dangerous and insisted that conventional exhaust stacks be fitted.Penrose (1984 page 179) describes a test flight in the second prototype which nearly ended in disaster when a fractured exhaust pipe burnt through the aileron control rod. The airframe was of thin-walled stressed skin construction, with the rear fuselage skinned in magnesium alloy. Like the Lysander, it made extensive use of extrusions in the airframe. To reduce the landing distance the wing incorporated automatic Handley Page slats coupled to the Fowler Flaps, with the radiator gills also coupled to the flap control, which was advanced at the time. The prototype first flew in September 1938, and while it was one of the fastest and most heavily armed fighters of its era, faster than the Spitfire Mk 1, its development was problematic and protracted. The engines overheated, the hydraulic engine controls were imprecise, the slats slammed open, and production was slow. Petter was frustrated by its lack of operational status in the RAF. In November 1940, he wrote a memo to Sholto Douglas stating \\"The Whirlwind is probably the most radically new aeroplane which has ever gone into service... New ideas I am afraid, even with the greatest care, always mean a certain amount of teething trouble... I really do not think these troubles have been any worse than they were on, say, the Spitfire... \\" In reply Sholto Douglas wrote, \\"... it seems to me that your firm is concentrating on producing large numbers of Lysanders, which no body wants... instead of concentrating on producing Whirlwinds which are wanted badly.\\" Shortly after this exchange 263 squadron became operational, but Petter always regretted that the Whirlwind was not available for the Battle of Britain and blamed Eric Mensforth for the delay in production. Spitfire development By 1942 Westland was building mostly Spitfires under contract. One of the problems with the early marks of Spitfire was variability of longitudinal stability, leading to aircraft getting dangerously out of control and contributing to the risk of structural failure . Petter made a significant contribution to improving the longitudinal stability of the Spitfire because he was the first to appreciate that aerodynamic modification to the elevator could provide additional stability. On his own initiative he had Penrose collect flight test stick force data and trim curves on a Spitfire at various centre of gravity loadings, then produced a prototype elevator with a bulged aerodynamic section, which produced a 'remarkable' improvement in stability, later being known as the 'Westland Elevator'. Welkin In 1940, the Air Ministry was motivated by the threat of high altitude bombers such as the Ju86P, to issue a specification for a high altitude interceptor, F4/40, followed by a revision F7/41 in 1941. Petter submitted two designs. His first was an innovative low-drag aircraft (P13), which featured a pair of staggered Merlins in the fuselage, one behind and slightly above the other, driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers. His second submission was a conventional design (P14), describing it as 'a logical development of the successful Whirlwind...\\". This was selected and became the Welkin. Specification F7/41 required a minimum speed to 415mph at 33,000ft with a maximum ceiling of 42,000ft. The Air Ministry also wanted low altitude manoeuvrability and a +9G ultimate load factor. The speed was equivalent to a Mach number of 0.62 while the loading condition caused Petter to select a thick wing section which would later be demonstrated to have a critical Mach number of 0.6. The significance of the thick wing section may not have been understood by Petterbecause compressibility effects had only started to be encountered by aircraft designers.Roland Beamont states that George Bulman was probably the first pilot among the allied nations to describe the effects of compressibility on aircraft handing in a memorandum at Langley in 1943 During test flying the effect of compressibility was experienced by Penrose who wrote, \\"In speed runs at the ceiling the wings and fuselage sometimes shook as though the machine was bumping over cobblestones.\\" Petter was reluctant to believe Penrose or accept that the wing would not be acceptable for high speed at altitude. Welkin Mark I, DX318, in flight While the cabin pressurisation was innovative and worked well, the heat from the compressor 'was like sitting in an oven'. Petter was unconcerned and reluctant to modify the system, Penrose thought that \\"It was the machine's performance which interested him, not that of the pilot\\". Petter devised a better method for cooling the cabin only after Penrose developed pneumonia attributed to this problem. Penrose said later that \\"At this time Petter's intellect put him ahead of most contemporary designers as shown by his introduction of pressurization and extensive use of remote electrical controls which subsequently became standard practice. By the time of the Welkin he had learnt the lesson that it takes as long to develop an aeroplane as to design it... Petter was an outstanding organiser and could envisage construction time-scales with greater knowledge than Fearn and Wheeldon.John 'Daddy' Fearn and Edward Wheeldon were Westland's 'Works Manager and Works Superintendent. Together they were responsible for production ...it was his lack of understanding people and their motives that became his major failure.\\" B1/44 proposal Westland's successful manufacture of Spitfires meant that Petter was well thought of by Sir Wilfrid Freeman, chief executive officer at the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) and by N. E. Rowe, its director of technical development. Discussions between all three led to Specification B1/44 for a jet-powered replacement for the Mosquito bomber. Petter developed his proposal for B1/44 as a private venture. This was a 56 ft span medium bomber powered by two Metrovick F.2/4 \\"Beryl\\" engines located within the fuselage and he persuaded the Westland board to put up capital to manufacture a mockup of the fuselage. This was his fifteenth wartime design study and his final design for Westland. Throughout his career when under stress, Petter would leave work without warning for periods of up to six weeks. In April 1944 he suddenly left work and it was rumoured that he had travelled to Switzerland, possibly to a monastery or a religious commune. In his absence Mensford switched the design effort from the B1/44 bomber to work on specification N11/44 for a Naval single-seat fighter that would eventually become the Wyvern. When Petter returned he was furious with Mensford. He knew Westland would not have the resources to develop and build both the fighter and the bomber. Also, to avoid the delays in production of the bomber he wanted Mensforth to give him full powers of a chief engineer responsible for every department concerned with its construction. He believed that in his absence the management had conspired to eliminate his project. As a result of this conflict he resigned in June, leaving the company in September 1944. He took with him the B1/44 design proposal and his large database of extrusions with their load capacities. =English Electric= Canberra First prototype Canberra at the time of the maiden flight (May 1949) By 1944 English Electric was established as a leading manufacturer of modern aircraft, both in terms of quantity and quality. This success was certainly due in part to the drive of the Preston site general manager, Arthur Sheffield. However, the company did not have engineers capable of original aircraft design and to address this deficiency Sir George Nelson, English Electric's chairman, was introduced to Petter, (possibly by Sir Wilfred Freeman or Sir Ralph Sorley). With Petter on board, English Electric was put on the MAP short list to develop Britain's first jet bombers. Petter started work for English Electric in July 1944. As he was unencumbered by an existing design office, he had the opportunity to personally recruit a team of ambitious young engineers. His first recruit was Frederick Page, who was then a senior aerodynamicist at Hawkers. Petter first discussed the B1/44 proposal with Page in October 1944, and appointed him as his chief stress man the following April. In 1945, Petter proposed a study contract to the MAP for a high-speed, high-altitude bomber to an updated specification (B3/45). This was granted in June allowing Petter and Page to establish the basic B3/45 configuration. While the original Westland B1/44 design had incorporated engines inside the fuselage, they realised this was incompatible with the internal fuel and bomb load. Instead they chose engines mounted in nacelles in the wings. Petter later explained that the technical solution was found to lie in the right choice of wing. Swept wings had been considered, but were was found to be unnecessary at the Mach numbers attainable when carrying a useful military load with the thrust available from two contemporary turbojets. The problems that the Welkin had encountered at altitude were avoided by choosing a wing with a low aspect-ratio allowing a modest thickness/chord ratio, together with a light wing-loading. The modest curvature of the wings meant that the intersection with the fuselage and nacelles required no fillets to smooth the flow. By late 1945 the design was sufficiently developed for a brochure to be submitted to the Ministry of Supply (MoS) who awarded a contract for four prototypes in January 1946. The study contract in June 1945 enabled Petter to recruit and expand his team.The postwar Control of Employment Act restricted recruitment to only companies that had contracts. He recruited Dai Ellis and Ray Creasey in 1946 as his aerodyamicists. He recruited Roland Beamont in May 1947 as his chief experimental test pilot; doing this as a means of bypassing Arthur Sheffield's control of the production test pilots and also because both he and Page wanted close integration of the test pilot within the design team. Members of the team Petter put together to develop the Canberra would go on to lead military aircraft development in the U.K for the next four decades, playing significant roles in the development of the Lightning, TSR-2, Jaguar, and the Tornado, some becoming members of the divisional board of directors. Of this time at Warton, Beamont said \\"although Petter was generally thought to be difficult I found him logical and 'ahead of the game' and totally oriented on making an enormous success of the Canberra. That it achieved this was due to his personal ability to recognise the technical argument and act on it correctly.\\" The aircraft would stay in operation in the RAF for 57 years until June 2006. In the United States, the Martin Company built the design under licence from 1953, as the Martin B-57, which was operated by the United States Air Force (USAF), NASA, the Pakistan Air Force and Taiwan Air Force. While the type was retired by the USAF in 1983, NASA still operates three. Lightning Farnborough in 1964 Despite the lack of enthusiasm for manned supersonic flight in postwar Britain (The Miles M.52 was cancelled in February 1946), Petter made provisional sketches for a supersonic fighter in 1946. To achieve a small frontal area and reduce wave drag it had two Rolls-Royce Derwent engines mounted one above the other in the fuselage, echoing his earlier Westland P13 proposal. He lobbied Whitehall on the matter of supersonic flight and in 1948 Handel Davis and a party from the MoS visited Petter in Warton to discuss experimental supersonic development work under specification E.R. 103. This meeting resulted in Petter initiating a design proposal with Page leading the design and Ray Creasey responsible for the aerodynamics. By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high- mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40¬∞ degree swept wing This proposal was submitted in the November and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric. On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949. To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60¬∞ with the ailerons moved to the wingtips. In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing. Hence, by late 1949 the basic configuration of the P.1A Lightning was fixed. By late 1949 the relationship between Sheffield's Preston Strand Road engineering works and Petter's design team at Warton had deteriorated. Modifications to the Canberra to incorporate a bomb aimer, camera bays and dual seat for the navigation trainer required a redesign of the front fuselage, which caused disruption in the design office and the workshops. In addition, with the P.1A Lightning design programme ramping up, Petter demanded a separate administration for Warton and an experimental workshop under his control as a condition of his continued service with English Electric. Sir George Nelson was unable to reach a compromise acceptable to both Petter and Sheffield. Page tried to persuade Petter to stay by promising to help in dealing with Sheffield. From December 1949 Petter ceased to take an active part in running Warton, he visited Warton once again to speak to a few people and clear his office. Page took over the day-to-day management until in February 1950, Petter resigned and Page was formally appointed his successor. The Lightning remains the only all-British Mach 2 aircraft. =Folland Aircraft= Privately owned Folland Gnat In the late 1940s Folland Aircraft Limited in Hamble, Hampshire was manufacturing sub-assemblies for other aircraft manufacturers. Henry Folland planned to retire and recruited Petter as chief engineer and deputy managing director. Petter joined Folland in September 1950, succeeding Henry Folland as managing director in July 1951. Although Petter had entered into an anti-poaching agreement with English Electric, a number of his ex-colleagues joined Folland when positions were openly advertised. With a strong team, led by a designer of Petter's pedigree, Folland was now able to win MoS design contracts, such as that for the development of the Red Dean air-to-air missile in mid-1951. On 11 July 1951 a delegation from the RAF visited Petter to discuss the requirements for a lightweight interceptor to counter the threat of escorted Russian Tu-4 bombers (AST OR/303). To address this, Petter developed a number of concepts. His early designs used jettisonable engines but by late 1951 he had focussed on more conventional designs; the Fo 139 and Fo 140 (which would eventually be developed into the Midge and Gnat respectively). With concept design work on the light fighter ramping up, Petter decided not to proceed with the Red Dean and the MoS cancelled the contract in November 1951. Petter sent a brochure describing the Fo.140 to the Air Staff in January 1952, but beyond this, further development of the light fighters was hindered by the lack of engines with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. The Bristol Saturn was cancelled, the AS Viper had insufficient thrust, Rolls Royce did not have a suitable engine and was not willing to develop one. To address this problem Petter approached Stanley Hooker at Bristol in late 1952 to discuss the design of a suitable engine. This meeting would lead to the development of the Orpheus. By 1952 Government interest in a light fighter had waned. Despite this Petter began the design and construction of the prototype as a private venture. The Fo 139 design was revised, adopting a shoulder-mounted wing and a low-set tailplane. In common with his previous designs, Petter made use of magnesium alloys in the structure, using material surplus from the RTV2 Missile programme in the construction of the Midge prototype. In June 1953 Petter presented his manifesto on light fighter design at the AFITA congress at the Paris Air show. In this paper, titled \\"Design for Production\\", Petter compared a 2500 kg light fighter with a 7500 kg standard fighter and concluded that although the weight ratio was 3:1, four times as many light fighters could be manufactured for the same cost. To achieve this he explained how the fuselage, wing structure, engine and services could all be simplified. Colonel Johnnie Driscoll, head of the NATO Mutual Weapons Development Program noted Petter's light fighter concept. NATO was interested in ground-attack aircraft that could be operated from improvised airfields and could be manufactured by postwar European industry. Driscoll formalised a NATO requirement in August 1954 that would become the NATO light fighter competition. It was based on Petter's concept but included the requirement to use low-pressure tyres. However, the Gnat was designed to operate from concrete runways and used high- pressure tyres. Petter refused to modify the undercarriage because this would mean bulging the undercarriage doors and spoiling the Gnat's clean aerodynamic lines. Stanley Hooker urged him to 'Just say that you will try to do it', but Petter's moral code would not let him make false claims. As a result, the Gnat was eliminated from the competition in June 1955. Ironically, the Gnat trainer design would show that the wider tyres could be used without increasing drag. Production of the Midge progressed to schedule and it was rolled out of the workshop on 31 July 1954, making its maiden flight on 11 August 1954. The Gnat first flew on 18 July 1955 and while it was demonstrated to be a capable aircraft, there was little interest in it in Europe. In November 1955 the Indian government showed an interest in both purchasing and in licensed manufacture. Petter made several visits to India and he and his design team were highly regarded by HAL. An approach was made to him to set up a design team in India.However, his relationship with Indian government officials was antagonistic due to arguments over variations in contract costs. In the late 1950s Petter rationalised his senior staff, dismissing those he thought had failed to meet his standards. However at the same time the Macmillan government was rationalising the aircraft industry and made the order for Gnat Trainers conditional on Folland merging with the Hawker Siddely group. Such a merger would effectively make Petter subordinate to Sir Sidney Camm, with whom Petter had a good relationship (Camm had provided Petter with the Hunter wind tunnel data during the development of the Gnat) but the working relationship would be intolerable. At the same period his wife Claude was showing the early signs of Parkinson's disease. These two factors prompted Petter to announce his resignation to the Hawker Siddely board on 11 November 1959, leaving Folland in the December. Personal life and retirement Throughout his education at Marborough and Cambridge Petter seems to have led a reclusive life. At Cambridge he had one close friend, John McCowan, with whom he shared an interest in motor cars. It was during a stay at the McCowan family farm that Petter met his future wife Claude, the daughter of Louis Munier a Swiss official at the League of Nations in Geneva. Teddy and Claude were married in August 1933, in her home town near Geneva, with McCowan as their best man. The Petters had three daughters, Camile in 1936, Francoise in 1938 and Jenni in 1945. While living in Dorset in the 1930s he designed his own house, a modern wooden chalet, with oil heating, double glazing and an automatic garage door. When he left Folland he had intended to continue as a consultant engineer, with a limited interest in the Gnat. However, in January 1960 Petter left the aircraft industry completely, stating \\"I have finished with aviation completely. I have strong religious interests to which I am now going to give a lot of my time.\\" ‚ÄåFive years earlier, Claude had been introduced to a 'Father Forget', a former minister of the Reformed Church of France who claimed to be able to cure her Parkinson's disease through communal prayer. With Claude and daughter Jenni, Teddy Petter joined Father Forget's commune in 1960 and moved to Switzerland. There he lived the simple life of a holy man until in May 1968 he died, aged 59, of bleeding from a chronic stomach ulcer. He was buried in Beruges, Poitou-Charentes, in France. Claude died in 1975.

Professional career Montgomery with the Nashville Sounds in 1987 Montgomery played collegiate baseball at Marshall University and was later drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. He made his debut with the Reds on August 1, 1987 at age 25. He pitched a total of 14 games, including one start. He was considered a marginal prospect, and the Reds traded Montgomery to the Royals on February 15, 1988 for Van Snider, an outfielder who would go on to only play 19 games in the majors. On April 29, 1990, Montgomery struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5-2 win over the Texas Rangers. Montgomery became the ninth American League pitcher and the 23rd pitcher in major league history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning. Kansas City installed Montgomery in the bullpen, and he appeared in 45 games, posting a record of 7-2 with a 3.45 earned run average. In 1989 he had a breakout season, winning 7 games and losing 3, saving 18, and posting a 1.37 ERA while acting primarily as a set-up man for Steve Farr. The following season, he became the Royals' closer, a role he held for most of his career. In 1993, Montgomery saved 45 games, tying Dan Quisenberry for the Royals' team record and tying him for the league lead with Duane Ward of the Toronto Blue Jays. That year he won the American League Rolaids Relief Man Award. Montgomery was also an All-Star in 1992, 1993, and 1996. In 1998, Montgomery collected 36 saves and was named Kansas City Royals Pitcher of the Year following the season. Montgomery lost effectiveness during the season, which he finished with 12 saves and a 6.84 ERA. He retired following the season, and was inducted into the Royals' Hall of Fame in , his first year of eligibility.

This publication was in recognition of Gro Harlem Brundtland's, former Norwegian Prime Minister, role as Chair of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). Its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a sustainable development path. The report sought to recapture the spirit of the Stockholm Conference which had introduced environmental concerns to the formal political development sphere. Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The document was the culmination of a ‚Äú900-day‚Äù international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised: written submissions and expert testimony from ‚Äúsenior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public‚Äù held at public hearings throughout the world. Content The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: # ‚ÄúRe-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; # strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and to assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and # raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments‚Äù (1987: 347). ‚ÄúThe Commission focused its attention in the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another‚Äù The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental- limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. The Brundtland Report claimed that poverty reduces sustainability and accelerates environmental pressures ‚Äì creating a need for the balancing between economy and ecology. The publication of Our Common Future and the work of the World Commission on Environment and Development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 Earth Summit and the adoption of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration and to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. An oft-quoted definition of sustainable development is defined in the report as: :\\"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\\" In addition, key contributions of Our Common Future to the concept of sustainable development include the recognition that the many crises facing the planet are interlocking crises that are elements of a single crisis of the whole and of the vital need for the active participation of all sectors of society in consultation and decisions relating to sustainable development.

After the First World War broke out, Galiano and sister ship Malaspina alternated between naval and civic duties along the Pacific coast, being retained as part of the government fleet. This included performing examination duties at Esquimalt. Galiano was commissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy on 15 December 1917 and given the prefix His Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS). Lieutenant R. M. Pope of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve was given command of the vessel. Loss In late October 1918, Galiano, just returned from the Queen Charlotte Islands (now Haida Gwaii) and, in need of some repair, was sent with supplies to the light house at Triangle Island off Cape Scott at the northwestern tip of Vancouver Island. A number of her regular crew were unable to make the trip due to illness as the 1918 flu pandemic had reached her base at Esquimalt. She set out towards the Queen Charlotte Islands from Triangle Island at 5 pm on 29 October 1918. When she made her only distress call at 3 am the next morning, she was estimated to be within visual range of the light at Cape St. James from Triangle Island. She was never heard from again and went down with the loss of all hands. At the time of her distress call, there were heavy seas running at her location in Queen Charlotte Sound. Galiano was lost just days after ran aground on Vanderbilt Reef, near Skagway, Alaska also in heavy weather. The Naval Memorial in Ross Bay Cemetery, Vancouver Island, British Columbia bears the names of 39 officers and men who were lost at sea. Of these, 36 were from HMCS Galiano, which sank on 30 October 1918.  Legacy  In honour of Galiano and her crew, Canadian Forces Fleet School Esquimalt (CFFS(E)) named its damage control training facility after the lost ship. Located in Colwood, British Columbia, DCTF Galiano houses multiple-storey flood and fire simulators and utilizes complex freshwater flooding and propane fire systems. The simulators are designed as realistic mock-ups of Canadian naval vessels to provide controlled emergency environments in which sailors are trained to respond to ruptured pipes, flooding compartments, engine-room fires, aircraft crashes, and electrical emergencies.

They are also among the most morphologically conservative of the brachiopods, having lasted from their earliest appearance to the present with very little change in shape. Shells of living specimens found today in the waters around Japan are almost identical to ancient Cambrian fossils. The Lingulata have tongue-shaped shells (hence the name Lingulata, from the Latin word for \\"tongue\\") with a long fleshy stalk, or pedicle, with which the animal burrows into sandy or muddy sediments. They inhabit vertical burrows in these soft sediments with the anterior end facing up and slightly exposed at the sediment surface. The cilia of the lophophore generate a feeding and respiratory current through the lophophore and mantle cavity. The gut is complete and J-shaped. Lingulata shells are composed of a combination of calcium phosphate, protein and chitin. This is unlike most other shelled marine animals, whose shells are made of calcium carbonate. The Lingulata are inarticulate brachiopods, so named for the simplicity of their hinge mechanism. This mechanism lacks teeth and is held together only by a complex musculature. Both valves are roughly symmetrical. The genus Lingula (Bruguiere, 1797) is the oldest known animal genus that still contains extant species. It is primarily an Indo-Pacific genus that is harvested for human consumption in Japan and Australia.

It is the fifth game in the Game Boy version of the original Mega Man series. The game follows the adventures of the protagonist Mega Man as he must defend the Earth from a group of powerful robots from outer space called the Stardroids. Mega Man V is unique among the Game Boy Mega Man games as it features original bosses rather than recycling those from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. Mega Man V is an action platformer in which the player selects stages in a non-linear fashion and acquires the weapon of each boss defeated to use as their own. Although it plays nearly identical to other games in the series, Mega Man V features a new default weapon (the powerful \\"Mega Arm\\") and introduces Tango, a new assistant character. Mega Man V received an average to positive critical reception. In 2013, Mega Man V was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year. Plot The game opens in an unspecified year in the 21st century (\\"20XX AD\\"), several months after the events of Mega Man IV and another failure by the infamous Dr. Wily to conquer the world. Mega Man and his sister Roll are strolling through a grassy field, when they are confronted by a mysterious robot who calls himself Terra. Mega Man attempts to fight Terra, only to find that his \\"Mega Buster\\" arm cannon has no effect on him. Mega Man is knocked unconscious, and powerful robots calling themselves the \\"Stardroids\\" attack Earth, defeating numerous robots, including Robot Masters from previous Mega Man games. Waking up in Dr. Light's laboratory, Mega Man is presented with the new and powerful \\"Mega Arm\\" to help him fight the Stardroids in his newest mission to save the planet. After defeating all the Stardroids, including Terra, Mega Man finds out that his archenemy Dr. Wily was ordering them to dominate Earth. Mega Man sets off to the mad scientist's new base, the Wily Star (a reference to the Death Star) to stop him. In the base, Mega Man has rematches with four foes from his previous adventures (Enker, Quint, Punk, and Ballade). Wily releases an ancient robot called Sunstar to destroy Mega Man. However, Sunstar attacks Wily instead, and then turns his attention to Mega Man. Mega Man wins the battle and tries to convince Sunstar to be repaired by Dr. Light. However, Sunstar is already too badly damaged, and minutes later he explodes, taking the Wily Star with him. Mega Man escapes using Rush. He walks through a field, pondering the recent events, when Wily makes one last, unsuccessful attack. The game ends with Mega Man chasing Wily off the screen. Gameplay The player fires the Mega Arm at an enemy. A Super Game Boy border surrounds the screen. The gameplay in Mega Man V is largely similar to other games in the Mega Man series. As the protagonist Mega Man, the player is presented with a set of action and platform-style levels to complete. Mega Man's primary weapon is his staple arm cannon. However, rather than being able to charge and fire a more powerful blast with the trademark Mega Buster, the Mega Arm is used in essentially the same manner. Charging up and releasing the firing button causes Mega Man's arm to detach, strike an enemy, and then reattach. Destroying the boss at the end of each stage adds its special weapon to Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game. As each boss is weak to specific weapon, the player is encouraged to complete some stages before others. These bosses are known in game as \\"Mercury\\", \\"Venus\\", \\"Mars\\", \\"Jupiter\\", \\"Saturn\\", \\"Uranus\\", \\"Neptune\\", and \\"Pluto\\", named after the first, second, fourth, and fifth through eighth planets in our Solar System. Pluto was, at the time the game was made, considered a planet, unlike from 2006 and onwards. Terra is named for the Latin word for Earth. Defeating some bosses will allow the player to access Mega Man's robot dog Rush, who can transform into useful \\"Coil\\" and \\"Jet\\" modes for easier stage navigation. Mega Man V also introduces Tango the cat, another robotic pet to help Mega Man. Like the bird Beat from previous installments in the series, Tango will appear on the screen when summoned to attack enemies, transforming into a buzzsaw and ricocheting around the room. As in Mega Man IV, the player can return to Dr. Light between stages to purchase items using \\"Power Chips (P-Chips)\\" scattered throughout the game. Mega Man V breaks an established trend in the Mega Man games released on the Game Boy handheld. Prior to its release, games in the series on the system featured a set of four \\"Robot Masters\\" boss characters from their titular NES counterpart and a second set of four from the succeeding NES game in the series. Mega Man V instead features entirely original enemy characters with the Stardroids, who are all named after the planets in the Solar System: Neptune, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Pluto, Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn and Terra (Earth). Development Mega Man V was developed by the same third-party company that worked on three of the four previous Game Boy Mega Man games. According to Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune, the fifth installment took the longest time to develop of all five of these titles. Inafune was responsible for the game's character designs after their initial concepts were devised. \\"When you have a theme to follow, it can make things easier and harder at the same time,\\" Inafune recounted. \\"Especially with a theme as vague as space.\\" He additionally recalled having \\"a lot of reservations\\" when designing the Stardroids. Tango was included as a support character not featured in the home console games; his name, like other characters in the series, is part of musical motif. Inafune, who always enjoyed working on animal support characters, was especially pleased to design Tango due to the artist's personal fondness for cats. Mega Man V is the final installment in the Game Boy line of games based on the original Mega Man series. Inafune stated, \\"In the end, I think we had a lot of fun working on this series\\". Mega Man V was developed with Super Game Boy support, which allows the game to be played with a custom color scheme and border on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was one of the first games available with added support from the peripheral. It was also the last time the classic 8-bit Mega Man sprite was used for a game released on an 8-bit console, and last until Mega Man 9 in 2008. Reception and legacy Overall critical reception for Mega Man V has been average to positive. While many aspects of the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, \\"If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though.\\" Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, \\"especially when you sit down with the Super Game Boy and cruise\\". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler. In 2008, Nintendo Power listed Mega Man V as the 14th best Game Boy or Game Boy Color video game, praising it as the best of a quality series of portable Mega Man games. Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 11th best Game Boy game due to its relative ambition compared to its Game Boy predecessors. Mega Man V was available for the similarly named Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan on April 13, 2001 alongside its four Game Boy Mega Man predecessors. Outside Japan, the game is considered to be quite rare. All five games on the Game Boy were to be released as part of a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004 titled Mega Man Anniversary Collection, but it was delayed indefinitely, renamed Mega Mania, and eventually cancelled. In 2011, IGN listed the game among titles they wished to see downloadable from the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man V is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console; it came out November 6, 2013 in Japan, on May 22, 2014 in North America.http://www.nintendo.com/eshop/mega-may Nintendo and August 28, 2014 in the PAL Region. Other media The characters and plotline for Mega Man V were incorporated into the Mega Man Gigamix comic books by Hitoshi Ariga, with the battle against the Stardroids acting as a finale. They were also present in the Mega Man series from Archie Comics, with a full adaptation of Mega Man V being foreshadowed in various stories but not coming to pass before the series went on indefinite hiatus. The comic storyline takes unique action of linking the Stardroids with Mega Man 3s Shadow Man and Ra Moon, the primary antagonist of Super Adventure Rockman, as well as giving them a history with the alien robot Duo and Trio, his unnamed antagonist from Mega Man 8. Ra Moon's intent during Super Adventure Rockman to prepare the Earth for the arrival of its Stardroid creations; when its defeat at Mega Man's hands made this impossible, it sent a signal to the Stardroids aboard their craft, the future Wily Star. Terra appeared briefly in issue 20 of the series while Mega Man was caught up in a time travel adventure, and later during a flashback in which he sent Ra Moon to Earth under the protection of the Kuiper Droids, a group of bodyguard robots of whom Shadow Man is the last surviving member. Dr. Light later witnessed the Stardroids' future invasion in a vision experienced during issue 55, the last issue before the series went on hiatus.

They were managed by Angelica, his on-screen girlfriend, for six months, until she left ECW in November 1999 to join the World Wrestling Federation as Lita, and then by Elektra until she turned on them in 2000. Doring and Roadkill quickly embarked on a two-year-long feud with Nova and Chris Chetti. This was followed by a series of matches with Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger and Joey Matthews and Christian York.

His father, an actor and comedian who briefly worked as a member of Ted Healy's \\"stooge\\" act, was born Jewish and his mother converted to Judaism. Matzo Balls for Breakfast and Other Memories of Growing Up Jewish His earliest experience in broadcasting was on the intercom system of Calvin Coolidge High School in Washington, D.C. in the 1950s. His upbeat, entertaining patter that was to become his trademark made his sports report a welcome treat for the kids. During this period he worked part-time at Baker's Shoe Store downtown, as a salesman. Many customers must have been puzzled at the ball park hawker's refrain of, \\"Get your hot dogs, get your hot doggies here\\" coming from the back store room. He was simply entertaining the staff and the customers, something he was to continue throughout his long career. Wolf began as a radio broadcaster on April 1, 1961, doing news, weather, and sports for WLSI-AM in Pikeville, Kentucky under the name Ken Wolf. He then moved on to radio jobs in Martinsburg, West Virginia at WEPM, and Washington, D.C. at WTOP-AM before landing a sports television role in 1965 at WTOP-TV (now WUSA) in Washington. There he became very well known and popular as the news sports anchor; he also did play-by-play announcing of local college and professional sports. He retained his job as sports director at WTOP-AM throughout the 1960s, even announcing occasionally on radio broadcasts of Washington Senators games. ABC Sports In 1976, Wolf gained an ABC Sports network role, working on Monday Night Baseball telecasts and as a host for coverage of football and the Olympics. Wolf's reception in those jobs was mixed, and he decided that he was best at the local news sports anchor role. WABC-TV and WCBS-TV Still under contract with ABC, Wolf returned to local sportscasting with a job at WABC-TV in New York in 1976, and then in 1980 moved to rival station WCBS-TV. His move to WCBS-TV resulted in a lawsuit, American Broadcasting Co. v. Wolf, in which ABC alleged that Wolf failed to negotiate in good faith and sought specific performance of their contract which would have kept Wolf off the air for two years. The New York Court of Appeals rejected ABC's argument, although they permitted ABC to seek relief in the form of monetary damages. He also broadcast live sports reports for Israeli television during the 1991 Gulf War. Return to WUSA-TV and Imus in the Morning Wolf returned to Washington as the sports anchor at WUSA, the former WTOP-TV, in June 1992. Wolf succeeded Glenn Brenner, who died earlier that year and had replaced Wolf back in 1977 when he joined ABC Sports. He was dismissed in August 1995. Between November 1995 and December 1996, Wolf was the guest host of The Tony Kornheiser Show on Thursdays on WTEM and sometimes he also flew to New York as a substitute sports anchor on Imus in the Morning when the regular sports anchor, Mike Breen, was away. Because of his work on Imus in the Morning and Don Imus' recommendation on the air continuously, Wolf went back to WCBS-TV as the sports anchor on February 3, 1997 (the most recent of his replacements at WCBS, Bernie Smilovitz, had returned to WDIV in Detroit after having been caught in WCBS' infamous 1996 mass firings). During his tenure at WCBS he began uttering his famous phrase \\"Let's go to the videotape!\\" on a regular basis to switch to a video of the game he was reporting on. During this time he also continued to do some work in radio, giving sports reports on the nationally syndicated Imus in the Morning program. Wolf broke the news of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Imus show, when he saw the World Trade Center on fire from his Lower Manhattan apartment. Wolf also covered the story for WCBS-TV (where he was working at the time). He stayed there until May 2004, returning to WABC (AM) in 2006 as the sports reporter for Curtis and Kuby, and continuing, with a two-week hiatus, on the Imus in the Morning program following Don Imus's arrival at WABC (AM). He served as Imus's sports contributor until November 3, 2016, when Imus decided to replace Wolf with Sid Rosenberg. Wolf sued Imus alleging age discrimination. Departure from WCBS-TV On May 27, 2004 Wolf was fired by WCBS-TV general manager Lew Leone three months before his contract expired, and replaced by a much younger anchor, Chris Wragge. The day after his firing, his picture covered half the front page of the New York Daily News with the other half being covered by the headline \\"WOLF FANS RAISE A HOWL\\". A few months after his firing, which generated much public outcry, Wolf was hired by radio station WABC and he appeared weekday mornings with Curtis Sliwa & Ron Kuby as well as Mark Simone's Saturday morning radio program. When Imus in the Morning returned to WABC in December 2007, Wolf was not the sports anchor: Tony Powell took that position. But after several weeks Wolf returned to his old position and continued as the morning sports anchor for the Imus in the Morning show. Wolf also hosted a Saturday sports talk show on 1050 ESPN Radio. Wolf modified his trademark \\"Let's go to the videotape!\\" to \\"Let's go to the audiotape!\\" Wolf's final day with the Imus show was November 4, 2016. He stayed at WABC until December 3, when his current contract expired.7\\\\. Plantation Arrest On February 7, 2019, Wolf turned himself in and was arrested after he broke letters off a sign at the entrance of Classics Plantation Estates in East Naples, Florida, according to deputies at the Collier County Sheriff's Office. Wolf, a resident of the community, expressed his opinion at homeowners association meetings that the word \\"plantation\\" was racist. Surveillance video on November 30, 2018 showed a man matching Wolf's description removing the word \\"plantation\\" from the sign with a tool. Wolf faced a felony charge of criminal mischief, according to the arrest report. Wolf told a radio talk show audience the following month that prosecutors \\"likely felt the intent was not criminal\\" so only required that he pay restitution for damages. Other appearances Wolf played himself in the film Rocky IV and has made several other cameo appearances. He is the author of the books Let's Go to the Videotape and Give Me a Break. Wolf is currently heard Mondays at 7:30 AM on \\"Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning\\" on WOR AM-710 in New York.

He played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, and Chicago Cubs. He was an outfielder known for his speed and ability as an effective leadoff hitter. Wilson's career total of 668 stolen bases currently ranks him in 12th place all-time among major leaguers.  Early life  Wilson was born in Montgomery, Alabama, but moved to Summit, New Jersey, at seven years old. He was a highly regarded high school baseball, football, and basketball player at Summit High School.Rosen, Byron. \\"Royal Rookie Will o' Wisp To Claiborne\\", The Washington Post, May 3, 1978, Accessed February 18, 2011. \\"NFL draft day found Willie Wilson in New York with baseball's K.C. Royals, and the Associated Press remarked that if the erstwhile Summit, N.J., prep football flash had gone on to play with Maryland after signing a letter of intent, he might have gotten rich as a No. 1 pro football draft pick.\\" In his senior year, he hit .436 and stole 28 bases in 28 attempts.  Professional career  = Early years = Wilson was drafted out of high school after signing a letter of intent to play college football at Maryland. The Kansas City Royals picked him in the first round of the 1974 draft. He started his professional career with the Gulf Coast Royals. He moved up to class-A in 1975 for the Waterloo Royals, leading the 1975 Midwest League champions in both RBIs and stolen bases, and in 1976 played for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. He earned a September call-up in 1976, playing in 12 games. He was mostly used as a pinch runner or defensive replacement, but did start one game on the penultimate day of the season. He had just six at bats, getting one hit and stealing two bases. Wilson began the 1977 season at Triple-A Omaha. In what turned out to be his last minor league action (not counting a stunt appearance in 2009), he batted .281 with 74 stolen bases. He was again called up in September, this time receiving more substantial playing time, batting .324 in 34 at bats with 6 steals. 1978 was Wilson's first full season in the majors. He split the left field job with Tom Poquette, Clint Hurdle and Joe Zdeb, getting the most playing time at the position among the four, while also backing up Amos Otis in center field. Overall, he played in 127 games, but had just 198 at bats while batting .217. Despite his limited playing time, he finished fifth in the American League with 46 stolen bases. He also appeared in three games in the 1978 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, starting Game Four. = Getting established =  1979  Wilson started the 1979 season as the Royals' fourth outfielder, but by mid-May he had established himself as the team's starting left fielder. He batted .315 and led the league in stolen bases with 83 and singles with 148, while also finishing seventh in hits and third in triples. On defense, he led the league in range factor and putouts and finished second in assists among left fielders.  1980  In 1980, Wilson started the year as the starting center fielder when Amos Otis opened the season on the disabled list, and acquitted himself well, posting an above- average range factor and making just one error in 195 total chances for the year in center. He moved back to left when Otis returned in late May, and wound up leading the league in several categories. His 705 official at bats were a major league record until it was surpassed by Jimmy Rollins in 2007. He also led the league in hits, runs scored, triples, and singles, finished second in steals with 79, and had at least 100 hits from both sides of the plate. He won both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards, and was fourth in the AL MVP voting, his best finish. In the 1980 American League Championship Series, Wilson batted .308 and tied George Brett for the team lead in runs batted in with four as the Royals swept the Yankees in three straight games. In the 1980 World Series, Wilson batted just .154 and struck out against Tug McGraw for the final out of the Royals' Game 6 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. This strikeout was Wilson's 12th of the Series, breaking the record of 11 held jointly by Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in the 1958 and 1973 World Series, respectively. Ryan Howard would break Wilson's record by striking out 13 times in the 2009 World Series.  1981‚Äì83  Wilson's batting average slipped to .303 in the strike-shortened 1981 season, and most of his other numbers were off from the previous two seasons as well. In the 1981 American League Division Series against the Oakland A's, he batted .308, but failed to score a run, steal a base, or get an extra-base hit in the three-game sweep. In 1982, Wilson bounced back to bat .332 and win the AL batting title, the first switch hitter to do so since Mickey Mantle in 1956. Although the Royals missed the playoffs for the first time since 1979, Wilson made his first American League All-Star team that year and winning his second Silver Slugger Award. He led the league in singles for the fourth year in a row and in triples for the second time in three seasons. In 1983, Wilson moved to center field in June when the club decided to shuffle their outfield, moving long-time center fielder Otis to right field, and moving Pat Sheridan and Leon Roberts, who had been sharing right field, over to left. In the midst of the shuffle, Wilson had his worst season at the plate to date, batting just .276. Although he still finished third in the league with 59 stolen bases and made the All-Star Team for the second time, his on-base percentage and slugging percentage also hit what were to that point career lows at .316 and .352 respectively. However, Wilson's problems in 1983 were not limited to on- field issues. = Drug scandal = After the end of the 1983 season, Wilson found himself in a drug scandal along with teammates Willie Aikens, Vida Blue, and Jerry Martin. All four pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug charges (attempting to purchase cocaine) on November 17. They became the first active major leaguers to serve jail time, serving 81 days at the Fort Worth, Texas, Federal Correctional Institution. He was suspended by commissioner Bowie Kuhn for the entire 1984 season, but the suspension was reduced on appeal and he was able to return on May 15. The Royals traded or released the other three, with only Wilson returning to the Royals, and he hit .301 and stole 47 bases after his return. = Remaining Royals career = In 1985, Wilson batted .278 and led the league in triples for the third time with a career-high 21. He also gained a measure of redemption from his 1980 World Series performance, hitting .310 against Toronto in the 1985 ALCS and .367 against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1985 World Series, helping the Royals to their first World Championship. Wilson remained a fixture in the outfield for the Royals over the next five seasons. Although his hitting wasn't what it once was, he still led the league twice more in triples and continued to finish in the top ten in steals, a run of 11 seasons that lasted until 1988, and may have continued if he didn't miss chunks of the 1989 and 1990 season to injuries. He also continued to play well defensively, leading the league in fielding percentage among center fielders in 1987, and among all outfielders in 1990, when he finished the year without a single error. = Oakland Athletics = Wilson left the Royals following the 1990 season as a free agent, and he was signed by the Oakland Athletics. There, he took over the role of F√©lix Jos√©, who had been traded late in 1990, as the fourth outfielder behind Rickey Henderson, Dave Henderson and Jose Canseco. He played 113 games, including at least 19 at all three outfield positions, and batted .238. In 1992, Dave Henderson missed most of the season with a hamstring injury, leaving Wilson as the starting center fielder. He played in 132 games, his most since 1988, and batted .270. In his first playoff action since the 1985 World Series, he stole seven bases in the 1992 ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Lou Brock's record for steals in one post-season (Brock stole seven bases each in the 1967 and 1968 World Series). He batted just .227, however, and the A's lost the series in six games. = Chicago Cubs = Wilson became a free agent again after the 1992 season, and he signed with the Chicago Cubs. He started 1993 in a center field platoon with Dwight Smith, later splitting time with Sammy Sosa when the latter wasn't playing in right field. He batted .258, but managed just seven stolen bases‚Äîa career-low for a full season‚Äîand he began the 1994 season on the bench behind Tuffy Rhodes. After playing just 17 games that year, he was released on May 16, ending his major league career. Wilson retired with a .285 career batting average and 668 stolen bases, which ranks 12th all-time. For his career, Wilson hit 13 inside-the-park home runs, the most of any major league player playing after 1950. He topped a .300 batting average five times and also led the league in triples five times, being one of only four players to accomplish the feat. Wilson posted a .987 fielding percentage as an outfielder in the majors.  Post-playing career and honors  Wilson coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system in 1995 and 1997. He was elected to the Royals Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2003, Wilson was named manager of the London Monarchs of the fledgling Canadian Baseball League, but the league folded halfway through the season. Wilson also came out of retirement in 2009, signing a one- day contract with the Kansas City T-Bones, a team playing in the independent Northern League. He currently runs the Willie Wilson Baseball Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri.

It is located on the China--Kyrgyzstan--Kazakhstan tripoint, east of lake Issyk Kul. Its geologic elevation is , but its glacial cap rises to . For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the Soviet Snow Leopard award criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak. Khan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by Jengish Chokusu (means \\"Victory peak\\", formerly known as Peak Pobeda) (7,439 m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in Kazakhstan and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after Jengish Chokusu (7,439 m) and Avicenna Peak (7,134 m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air. Names The name \\"Khan Tengri\\" literally means \\"King Heaven\\" in Kazakh and possibly references the deity Tengri. In some other local languages, it is known as Khan Tangiri Shyngy, Kan-Too Chokusu, Pik Khan-Tengry, and Hantengri Feng. (, , Han T√°≈Ñiri, ÿ≠ÿßŸÜ ÿ™ÿ£⁄≠ÿ¶ÿ±ÿ¶; , ÿ≠ÿßŸÜ-ÿ™€ï⁄≠Ÿâÿ±Ÿâ; ; , Xiao'erjing: ŸáŸãÿß ÿ™ŸçŸí ŸÇŸí ŸÑŸê ŸÅÿπŸí). Local residents named the mountain Khan-Tengri for the unique beauty of snow giants. Features Khan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the name \\"blood mountain\\" in Kazakh and Kyrgyz (; ). Located just across the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, 16 km north of Jengish Chokusu, Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapaev Peak () and Gorky Peak (). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry. History Although it is almost 430 m (1,500 ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher. Peter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).Semenov, Petr Petrovitch. Travels in the Tian'-Shan' 1856-1857. Trans. by Liudmila Gilmour, Colin Thomas and Marcus Wheeler. Edited and annotated by Colin Thomas, pp. 180, 184-185. The Hakluyt Society, London. (1998). . The first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by Mikhail Pogrebetsky's Ukrainian team by a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious Snow Leopard award. Anatoli Boukreev achieved the first solo speed ascent in 1990.

It most commonly affects the premolars and canines, usually along the cervical margins.Forbes-Haley, C., Jones, S. B., Davies, M., & West, N. X. (2016). Establishing the Effect of Brushing and a Day's Diet on Tooth Tissue Loss in Vitro. Dentistry Journal, 4 (3). Based on clinical surveys, studies have shown that abrasion is the most common but not the sole aetiological factor for development of non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) and is most frequently caused by incorrect toothbrushing technique. Abrasion frequently presents at the cemento-enamel junction and can be caused by many contributing factors, all with the ability to affect the tooth surface in varying degrees.Sugita L, Nakashima S, Ikeda A, Burrow M, Nikaido T. A pilot study to assess the morphology and progression of non-carious cervical lesions. Journal of Dentistry 2017:51-6. The appearance may vary depending on the cause of abrasion, however most commonly presents in a V-shaped caused by excessive lateral pressure whilst tooth-brushing. The surface is shiny rather than carious, and sometimes the ridge is deep enough to see the pulp chamber within the tooth itself. With the presence of non-carious cervical loss due to abrasion, this may lead to consequences and symptoms such as increased tooth sensitivity to hot and cold, increased plaque trapping which will result in caries and periodontal disease, difficulty of dental appliances such as retainer and denture in engaging the tooth, and also it may be aesthetically unpleasant to some people. In order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the cause first needs to be identified and ceased, e.g. overzealous brushing. Once this has occurred subsequent treatment may involve the changes in oral hygiene or toothpaste, application of fluoride to reduce sensitivity or the placement of a restoration to aid in reducing the progression of further tooth loss.  Cause  Abrasion occurring on the cervical margins from the effects of friction from toothbrushing and abrasive toothpastes Cause of abrasion may arise from interaction of teeth with other objects such as toothbrushes, toothpicks, floss, and ill-fitting dental appliance like retainers and dentures. Apart from that, people with habits such as nail biting, chewing tobacco, lip or tongue piercing, and having occupation such as joiner, are subjected to higher risks of abrasion. Abrasion can also occur from the type of dentifrice being utilized as some have more abrasive qualities such as whitening toothpastes. The aetiology of dental abrasion can be due to a single stimuli or, as in most cases, multi-factorial.Lee A, He LH, Lyons K, Swain MV. Tooth wear and wear investigations in dentistry. Journal of oral rehabilitation. 2012 Mar 1;39(3):217-25. The most common cause of dental abrasion, is the combination of mechanical and chemical wear. Tooth brushing is the most common cause of dental abrasion, which is found to develop along the gingival margin, due to vigorous brushing in this area.Sadaf D, Ahmad Z. Role of brushing and occlusal forces in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL). International journal of biomedical science: IJBS. 2014 Dec;10(4):265.Salas MM, Nascimento GG, Vargas-Ferreira F, Tarquinio SB, Huysmans MC, Demarco FF. Diet influenced tooth erosion prevalence in children and adolescents: Results of a meta-analysis and meta-regression. Journal of dentistry. 2015 Aug 31;43(8):865-75. The type of toothbrush, the technique used and the force applied when brushing can influence the occurrence and severity of resulting abrasion.Zanatta FB, Bergoli AD, Werle SB, Antoniazzi RP. Biofilm removal and gingival abrasion with medium and soft toothbrushes. Oral Health Prev Dent. 2011 Jan 1;9(2):177-83. Further, brushing for extended periods of time (exceeding 2-3 min) in some cases, when combined with medium/hard bristled toothbrushes can cause abrasive lesions.Vieira GH, Nogueira MB, Gaio EJ, Rosing CK, Santiago SL, Rego RO. Effect of Whitening Toothpastes on Dentin Abrasion: An In Vitro Study. Oral health & preventive dentistry. 2016 Jun 27. Different toothbrush types are more inclined to cause abrasion, such as those with medium or hard bristles. The bristles combined with forceful brushing techniques applied can roughen the tooth surface and cause abrasion as well as aggravating the gums.Wiegand A, Kuhn M, Sener B, Roos M, Attin T. Abrasion of eroded dentin caused by toothpaste slurries of different abrasivity and toothbrushes of different filament diameter. Journal of dentistry. 2009 Jun 30;37(6):480-4. Repetitive irritation to the gingival margin can eventually cause recession of the gums. When the gums recede, the root surface is exposed which is more susceptible to abrasion.Addy M, Hunter ML. Can tooth brushing damage your health? Effects on oral and dental tissues. International dental journal. 2003 Jun 1;53(S3):177-86. Comparatively, electric toothbrushes have less abrasive tendencies.Wiegand A, Lemmrich F, Attin T. Influence of rotating‚Äìoscillating, sonic and ultrasonic action of power toothbrushes on abrasion of sound and eroded dentine. Journal of periodontal research. 2006 Jun 1;41(3):221-7. Types of toothpastes can also damage enamel and dentine due to the abrasive properties.Tellefsen G, Liljeborg A, Johannsen A, Johannsen G. The role of the toothbrush in the abrasion process. International journal of dental hygiene. 2011 Nov 1;9(4):284-90. Specific ingredients are used in toothpaste to target removal of the bio-film and extrinsic staining however in some cases can contribute to the pastes being abrasive.Bizhang M, Riemer K, Arnold WH, Domin J, Zimmer S. Influence of Bristle Stiffness of Manual Toothbrushes on Eroded and Sound Human Dentin‚ÄìAn In Vitro Study. PLoS ONE. 2016 Apr 12;11(4):e0153250. Whitening toothpastes are found to be one of the most abrasive types of toothpastes, according to the RDA Scale, detailed below.Demarco FF, Meireles SS, Sarmento HR, Dantas RV, Botero T, Tarquinio SB. Erosion and abrasion on dental structures undergoing at-home bleaching. Clin Cosmet Investig Dent. 2011 Jul 18;3:45-52. In-home and clinical whitening have been proven to increase the likelihood of an individual experiencing dental abrasion. It is believed that dental abrasion due to the whitening process is caused by a combination of both mechanical and chemical irritants, for example, using whitening toothpaste and at home bleaching kits together. However, if an individual is regimented in their after-whitening care then they can avoid loss of dentine minerals and in turn abrasion can be avoided. (that contribute to developing abrasion).John SS, White DJ. History of the development of abrasivity limits for dentifrices 2015 Another factor that can contribute to abrasion is alteration of pH levels in the saliva. This can be sugary/ acidic foods and liquids. The reasoning behind this is that an increase in acidity of saliva can induce demineralization and therefore compromising the tooth structure to abrasive factors such as tooth brushing or normal wear from mastication.Neel EA, Aljabo A, Strange A, Ibrahim S, Coathup M, Young AM, Bozec L, Mudera V. Demineralization‚Äìremineralization dynamics in teeth and bone. International Journal of Nanomedicine. 2016;11:4743. When the tooth structure is compromised, this is where the mineral content of the saliva can create shallow depressions in the enamel and thus, when brushed can cause irreparable damage on tooth surface.Lussi A, Schl√ºter N, Rakhmatullina E, Ganss C. Dental erosion‚Äìan overview with emphasis on chemical and histopathological aspects. Caries research. 2011 May 31;45(Suppl. 1):2-12.Jaeggi T, Lussi A. Toothbrush abrasion of erosively altered enamel after intraoral exposure to saliva: an in situ study. Caries Research. 1999 Sep 23;33(6):455-61. The dental abrasion process can be further stimulated and accelerated through the effects of dental Acid erosion.  Relative dentin abrasivity  Relative dentin abrasivity (RDA) is a standardised measurement of the abrasive effect that the components of the toothpaste have on a tooth. The RDA scale was developed by the American Dental Association (ADA). The RDA scale compares toothpaste abrasivity to standard abrasive materials and measures the depth of cut at an average of 1 millimetre per 100,000 brush strokes onto dentine.John S, White D. History of the development of abrasivity limits for dentifrices. The journal of clinical dentistry. 2015;26(02):51-54. This comparison generates abrasive values for the dentifrices that would be safe for daily use. In vitro dental studies showed a positive correlation between the highest RDAs and greater dentin wear.Macdonald E, North A, Maggio B, Sufi F, Mason S, Moore C, Addy M, West NX. Clinical study investigating abrasive effects of three toothpastes and water in an in situ model. J Dent 2010;38:509‚Äì516. Since 1998, the RDA value is set by the standards DIN EN ISO 11609. Currently, the claim on products such as toothpaste are not regulated by law, however a dentifrice is required to have a level lower than 250 to be considered safe and before being given the ADA seal of approval.Toothpastes. Ada.org. 2017 [cited 7 May 2017]. Available from: http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/toothpastes The values obtained depend on the size, quantity and surface structure of abrasive used in toothpastes. While the RDA score has been shown to have a statistically significant correlation to the presence of abrasion, it is not the only contributing factor to consider.Walsh M, Darby ML. Dental hygiene: theory and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences; 2014 Apr 15. Other factors such as the amount of pressure used whilst brushing, the type, thickness and dispersion of bristle in the toothbrush and the time spent brushing are other factors that contribute to dental abrasion.  Treatment  There are several reasons to treat abrasion lesion(s) (also known as ‚ÄòClass V cavity‚Äô) such as:- # Sensitivity. # Presence of carious lesion. # Aesthetically unpleasant. # Arresting the progression of the lesion. # Reducing potential onset of caries or periodontal disease as these lesions can present as a plaque retention factor. # Where there is a risk of pulpal exposure if lesion depth is severe enough. # When retention of a removable appliance is interfered. Ie. Denture # To improve denture clasp(s) retention. # Overall integrity of tooth structure is compromised. In order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the aetiology first needs to be identified. The most accurate way of doing so is completing a thorough medical, dental, social and diet history. All aspects needs to be investigated as in many cases the cause of abrasion can be multi- factorial. Once a definitive diagnosis is completed the appropriate treatment can commence. Treatment for abrasion can present in varying difficulties depending on the current degree or progress caused by the abrasion. Abrasion often presents in conjunction with other dental conditions such as attrition, decay and erosion. Evidence suggest there is a decrease in the effect of dental abrasion with dental erosion when fluoride varnish is applied onto teeth. Successful treatment focuses on the prevention and progression on the condition and modifies the current habit/s instigating the condition. =Removal of Causes= If the cause of abrasion is due to habitual behaviours, the discontinuation and change of habit is critical in the prevention of further tooth loss.Bergstr√∂m J, Lavstedt S. An epidemiologic approach to toothbrushing and dental abrasion. Community dentistry and oral epidemiology. 1979 Feb 1;7(1):57-64. The correct brushing technique is pivotal and involves a gentle scrub technique with small horizontal movements with an extra-soft/soft bristle brush. Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush. If abrasion is the result of an ill-fitting dental appliance, this should be corrected or replaced by a dental practitioner and should not be attempted in a home setting. =Chemical= The current selection of dentifrice should also be critically analysed and changed to include a less abrasive and gentler paste such as sensitive toothpaste as evidence suggests that a very abrasive toothpaste would lead to loss of tooth structure. A toothpaste containing increased fluoride will also help combat the increased sensitivity and risk to dental decay.Seong J, Parkinson CP, Davies M, Claydon NC, West NX. Randomised clinical trial to evaluate changes in dentine tubule occlusion following 4 weeks use of an occluding toothpaste. Clinical Oral Investigations. 2017 Apr 1:1-9. Fluoride varnish is known to alleviate hypersensitivity in teeth and can be used as a preventive measure for high risk patients of dental erosion with abrasion because fluoride varnish is reported to have an effect on the surface and subsurface of the tooth. Treatment in the dental chair may include a fluoride application or the placement of a restoration in more severe cases. If the lesion is small and confined to enamel or cementum, a restoration is not warranted, instead the eradication of rough edges should occur to reduce plaque retentive properties.Marinho VC. Cochrane fluoride reviews: an overview of the evidence on caries prevention with fluoride treatments. Faculty Dental Journal. 2014 Apr;5(2):78-83. However, in the case of dental decay, aesthetic concerns or defects close to the pulp a restoration may be completed.Harpenau LA, Noble WH, Kao RT. Diagnosis and management of dental wear. Today's FDA: official monthly journal of the Florida Dental Association. 2011 Dec;24(5):50-7. Further restorative work may be required when the lesion compromises the overall strength of the tooth or when the defect contributes to a periodontal problem the lesion may be restored.White JM, Eakle WS. Rationale and treatment approach in minimally invasive dentistry. The Journal of the American Dental Association. 2000 Jun 30;131:13S-9S. Once abrasions has been diagnosed and treated it should be closely monitored to identify further progression or potential relief of symptoms. = Restoration = Ideal properties of restoration materials particularly for these lesions include:-Burke, F. J. (2015). Dental Materials: What Goes Where? Class V Restorations. Dental Update,42(9), 829-839. # Satisfactory wear resistance most commonly caused by overzealous/excessive force used during toothbrushing. # Low modulus of elasticity, given that teeth (anterior dentition) have been considered to flex around the cervical area (area closest to gum levels). # Good aesthetics. There are other properties of restoration materials which could be considered appropriate, although not specific to Class V restorations, which includes:- # Small filler particles for polishability to achieve better aesthetics. # Sufficiently stiff consistency to hold shape but still allows easy handling for placement into a cavity. # Self-curing/setting or curable to any depth. # Dimensionally stable or low shrinkage/stress. # Fluoride release. # Self- adhesive to enamel and dentine. Dental materials such as amalgam, glass ionomer (GI), resin-modified glass ionomer (a variant of GI) and resin composite are the types of restoration materials available when active treatment by means of restoration is appropriate. Taking into consideration these factors and their respective dental materials' properties, evidence and studies has shown that resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restoration material is the recommended restoration material in clinical situations as it performs optimally - provided when aesthetics is not the top priority when restoring these lesions. The surface of such lesions should be roughened prior to its restorationStewardson DA, Creanor S, Thornley P, Bigg T, Bromage C, Browne A, Cottam D, Dalby D, Gilmour J, Horton J, Roberts E, Westoby L, Burke T.

He played quarterback for the USC Trojans before playing professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Rams from 1976 through 1981. He also played in the World Football League (WFL) for the Southern California Sun in 1975. Haden is a Rhodes Scholar, was a practicing attorney from 1982 to 1987, and was a partner at Riordan, Lewis & Haden, a private equity firm, from 1987 to 2010. He is also known for his work as a former sportscaster, beginning with CBS Sports in 1982, and ending his career in that field as a color commentator for NBC Sports' Notre Dame football coverage. Biography =Early years= Born in Westbury, New York, to working-class Irish American parents, Haden is the fourth of five children. He had a close relationship with his mother, Helen Haden, who told her children to \\"Live your life so that you have standing room only at your funeral.\\"David Wharton, Pat Haden is still a dashing figure, Los Angeles Times, July 24, 2010, Accessed July 25, 2010. As a boy, Haden had a boyhood paper route, then worked at a shoe store where he also pushed accessories in order to earn an extra commission. He had the same mentality in sports, where he used smarts and toughness he gained from keeping up with his older brothers to compensate for physical shortcomings. By high school, his parents had moved to Southern California. =Playing career= High school career Haden played high school football at Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, where he became starting quarterback. He became close friends with teammate J.K. McKay, son of then-USC football coach John McKay; the two were opposites: J.K. was quick-witted and easygoing, while Haden was not. Haden and McKay shared the CIF Southern Section Player of the Year award in 1970. When Haden's parents had to move again, he stayed with the McKays for his senior year of high school. He was highly sought after and was recruited by many schools, including Notre Dame. Haden was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame in 1995. College career Prior to College Football Haden and McKay won the CIF championship game in overtime against Lakewood High School. The game was played at the LA Coliseum, where Haden would go on to lead the Trojans to many victories. Haden and J.K. McKay joined the highly regarded USC Trojans under head coach John McKay; they joined a group of friends in living at an apartment building just off campus. At USC, he made it to three Rose Bowl appearances and won two national championships. In the final game of his college career, the 1975 Rose Bowl, he was named co-Most Valuable Player. Haden also was a recipient of the Today's Top V Award in 1975, which at the time honored five (now ten) senior student-athletes. He was put into the GTE Academic All-American Hall of Fame in 1988. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1995. An athletic and academic stand-out, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. In 1973, he threw for 1,832 yards with 13 TD vs 11 INT. In 1974, he threw for just 988 yards (in part due to 98 fewer pass attempts) but still threw 13 TD vs 11 INT.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-footbl- media-guide.pdf Professional career Haden played one season in the World Football League, its last, for the Southern California Sun, which allowed him to attend school in England at Oxford University under his Rhodes Scholarship. His decision to go to the United Kingdom for schooling hurt his NFL possibilities, as did a lack of height () and arm strength, and he dropped to the seventh round of the NFL Draft.1975 NFL Draft on databaseFootball.com Haden made the Los Angeles Rams' roster in 1976 as the third quarterback, behind James Harris and Ron Jaworski. When both Harris and Jaworski were injured, Haden was pressed into duty in the second game of the season. Haden responded by playing mostly mistake-free football, letting running backs Lawrence McCutcheon and John Cappelletti shoulder the offensive load and passing only occasionally. Harris returned to the lineup as starting quarterback and Haden went back to a backup role. In a Monday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Harris played poorly in a 20-12 loss, and Rams head coach Chuck Knox was ordered by team owner Carroll Rosenbloom to bench Harris in favor of Haden. This is documented in Knox's autobiography Hard Knox: The Life of an NFL Coach and William Rhoden's Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback. At the time of the quarterback change, Harris was the top-rated passer of the National Football Conference. The NFL records show that Harris finished as the NFC's top-rated passer of 1976. Despite the change, the Rams went on to win the NFC Western Division title and a 14‚Äì12 upset of the defending NFC champion Dallas Cowboys in the opening round of the NFC playoffs, but the Rams fell to the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. The Rams revamped their quarterback position for the 1977 season. Harris and Jaworski were traded, and the Rams acquired veteran QB Joe Namath from the New York Jets. Namath started the first four games, but it was evident his knees couldn't take it anymore, so the Rams went back to Haden. The Rams took eight victories in the last 10 games, won the NFC West and made the playoffs again. Their first-round opponent was the Vikings at home in the rain, but the Rams lost 14-7 in the Mud Bowl. Haden's small hands impaired his ability to grip the wet muddy ball. Haden completed 14 of 32 passes for 130 yards and one touchdown with 3 interceptions while Viking QB Bob Lee was only able to complete 5 of 10 passes for 57 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions. Haden was rewarded with the starting position from day one in 1978. The Rams started fast, winning their first eight games, but tailed off to 12-4, and won their third straight NFC West Division title. Haden threw a pair of touchdown passes and led the Rams to a 34-10 victory against the Vikings in the first round of the playoffs. The defending champion Dallas Cowboys walloped the Rams 28-0 in the 1978 NFC Championship Game on their way to Super Bowl XIII. Haden was voted the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club NFC Player of the Year of the 1978 season. Haden began the 1979 season as the starter, but a broken finger midway through the season sidelined him in favor of Vince Ferragamo, who led the Rams to Super Bowl XIV. Because of Rams' coach Ray Malavasi's policy of giving an injured starter his job back, Haden began the 1980 season as the starter with Ferragamo as the backup. Haden was injured in the Rams season opener against the Detroit Lions. Ferragamo took over as the starter and didn't relinquish the job (despite Haden returning mid-season), passing for a then Rams-record 30 touchdown passes. Ferragamo, however, bolted the Rams for the Canadian Football League. Haden went into the 1981 season as starter, but was injured midway through the season. After the season, while recovering from knee surgery and contemplating retirement, he got a call from CBS about a broadcast job and decided to take it. =Broadcasting career= After spending a few years at CBS, Haden was hired as the color commentator for NBC Sports' coverage of Notre Dame college football, and held similar duties for their Arena Football coverage from 2003 through 2006 and Fox Sports' Bowl Championship Series coverage in 2008. His position as the Notre Dame color commentator is ironic in that he, as USC's quarterback in 1974, helped orchestrate one of Notre Dame's greatest losses (and, conversely, one of USC's greatest wins, known as \\"The Comeback\\"). The Trojans won 55-24 despite trailing 24-0 at one point and 24-6 at halftime. Haden admits that his mother wanted him to go to Notre Dame and always lights a candle in her memory at the grotto whenever he is on campus. Haden also was a color man for CBS Sports' college football coverage (being one of a three- man booth with former Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian and play-by-play man Brent Musburger, and later working with Jim Nantz), and provided color commentary for TNT's Sunday night football coverage and Westwood One's radiocasts, primarily working the Sunday night schedule which immediately followed his TV commitments (at the time, TNT and ESPN split the Sunday night games between them, with TNT broadcasting the first half of the season and ESPN the second half). Haden also called one NFL on CBS game in 1988 and some NFL on CBS games in 1989 during the busier weeks of the 1988 NFL Season and 1989 NFL Season, when the network's seven announcing teams weren't enough to cover the network games. =Private equity career= In 1987, he joined Riordan, Lewis & Haden, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles that focuses on making investments in growing, profitable businesses with $20 ‚Äì 200 million in revenue. He has served as a director of a number of RLH portfolio companies including TetraTech, Systems Management Specialists, Data Processing Resources Corporation (formerly NASDAQ: DPRC), The Apothecary Shops, and Adohr Farms.

See the Library of America edition edited by George Thomas Tanselle. is the fourth book by the American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1849. The book is semi-autobiographical and recounts the adventures of a refined youth among coarse and brutal sailors and the seedier areas of Liverpool. Melville wrote Redburn in less than ten weeks. While one scholar describes it as \\"arguably his funniest work\\",Blum (2011), 159 scholar F. O. Matthiessen calls it \\"the most moving of its author's books before Moby-Dick\\".Matthiessen (1941), 396 Plot Unable to find employment at home, young Wellingborough Redburn signs on the Highlander, a merchantman out of New York City bound for Liverpool, England. Representing himself as the \\"son of a gentleman\\" and expecting to be treated as such, he discovers that he is just a green hand, a \\"boy\\", the lowest rank on the ship, assigned all the duties no other sailor wants, like cleaning out the \\"pig-pen\\", a longboat that serves as a shipboard sty. The first mate promptly nicknames him \\"Buttons\\" for the shiny ones on his impractical jacket. Redburn quickly grasps the workings of social relations aboard ship. As a common seaman he can have no contact with those \\"behind the mast\\" where the officers command the ship. Before the mast, where the common seaman work and live, a bully named Jackson, the best seaman aboard, rules through fear with an iron fist. Uneducated yet cunning, with broken nose and squinting eye, he is described as \\"a Cain afloat, branded on his yellow brow with some inscrutable curse and going about corrupting and searing every heart that beat near him.\\" Redburn soon experiences all the trials of a greenhorn: seasickness, scrubbing decks, climbing masts in the dead of night to unfurl sails, cramped quarters, and bad food. Launcelott's Hey, 1843 When the ship lands in Liverpool he is given liberty ashore. He rents a room and walks the city every day. One day in a street called Launcelott's Hey he hears \\"a feeble wail\\" from a cellar beneath an old warehouse and looking into it sees \\"the figure of what had been a woman. Her blue arms folded to her livid bosom two shrunken things like children, that leaned toward her, one on each side. At first I knew not whether they were alive or dead. They made no sign; they did not move or stir; but from the vault came that soul-sickening wail.\\" He runs for help but is met with indifference by a ragpicker, a porter, his landlady, even by a policeman who tells him to mind his own business. He returns with some bread and cheese and drops them into the vault to the mother and children, but they are too weak to lift it to their mouths. The mother whispers \\"water\\" so he runs and fills his tarpaulin hat at an open hydrant. The girls drink and revive enough to nibble some cheese. He clasps the mother's arms and pulls them aside to see \\"a meager babe, the lower part of its body thrust into an old bonnet. Its face was dazzlingly white, even in its squalor; but the closed eyes looked like balls of indigo. It must have been dead for some hours.\\" Judging them beyond the point at which medicine could help, he returns to his room. A few days later he revisits the street and finds the vault empty: \\"In place of the woman and children, a heap of quick-lime was glistening.\\" On the docks he meets Harry Bolton, a dandy who claims to be a sailor looking for a job, and Redburn helps him procure a berth on the Highlander for the return voyage. They become fast friends and make a trip to London where they visit a luxurious private club, Aladdin's Palace, with an exotic environment Redburn struggles to make sense of, concluding it must be a gambling house. The ship soon departs for New York and Bolton's deficits as sailor become apparent. Redburn suspects that Bolton has never been to sea before and Bolton is tormented by the crew. Jackson, after being ill in bed for four weeks, returns to active duty: he climbs to the topsail yard, then suddenly vomits \\"a torrent of blood from his lungs\\", and falls headfirst into the sea and disappears. The crew never speak his name again. Reaching port, Redburn heads for his home and Bolton signs on a whaler. Redburn later hears that Bolton, far out in the Pacific, fell over the side and drowned.

Living with him in the small house in New York City were his wife, child, mother, sisters, and his brother Allen with his wife and child. Melville later portrayed himself at this time as being forced to write \\"with duns all around him, & looking over the back of his chair‚Äî& perching on his pen & diving in his inkstand‚Äîlike the devils about St. Anthony.\\" The book is a fictional narrative based loosely on Melville's own first voyage to Liverpool in 1839. The manuscript was completed in less than ten weeks and, without any attempt at polishing it, Melville submitted it to his American publisher Harper & Bros who published it in November 1849. Melville checked the proof sheets, which came out in August, and sent them along to Bentley for publication in England, where it appeared six weeks before the American version. In 1922 it was published as a volume of the Constable edition of Melville's complete works. Since then it has been continuously in print in inexpensive hard cover editions and since 1957 in paperback.Parker, 345 Reception Melville referred to Redburn and his next book White-Jacket as \\"two jobs which I have done for money‚Äîbeing forced to it as other men are to sawing wood\\".Delbanco, Andrew: Melville, His World and Work. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 111. It was reviewed favorably in all the influential publications, American and British, with many critics hailing it as Melville's return to his original style. The critics were divided along national lines when reviewing the scene in Launcelots Hey, the British dubbing it \\"improbable\\", the Americans \\"powerful\\". In 1884 William Clark Russell, the most popular writer of sea stories in his generation, praised the book's force and accuracy in print. He also sent Melville a personal letter where, among other items, he said \\"I have been reading your Redburn for the third or fourth time and have closed it more deeply impressed with the descriptive power that vitalises every page.\\"Parker, 344 John Masefield would later single the book out as his favorite of Melville's works. When Redburn was praised, Melville wrote in his journal, \\"I, the author, know [it] to be trash, & wrote it to buy some tobacco with\\". He later complained: \\"What I feel most moved to write, that is banned‚Äîit will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches.\\"Parker, 323 Assessments Elizabeth Hardwick finds that passages of the book display a rhetorical brilliance: \\"Throughout Melville's writings there is a liberality of mind, a freedom from vulgar superstition, occasions again and again for an oratorical insertion of enlightened opinion.\\" She points to the passage in chapter 33 where Melville describes the German immigrants preparing for their voyage to America: Interpretations of Redburn generally fall into two schools. The first, usually called the biographical school, may be found in studies of Melville written in the 1920s by critics such as Raymond Weaver, John Freeman, and Lewis Mumford. Typifying this school's approach is Mumford's statement that: By the 1950s, a second school arose which might be called the \\"mythic\\" school. Newton Arvin wrote: This new approach represented a broad trend that sought to reinterpret American literature‚ÄîIrving, Cooper, Hawthorne, Twain, James, Faulkner, and Hemingway‚Äîin the light of mythic quests and patterns. In one view, Redburn is \\"a stronger indictment of an American embarking upon a voyage of international experience than Henry James would produce and a more ironic and embittered portrait of the young protagonist's incapacity for art than James Joyce would produce.\\" Critics have clarified or called attention to particular points. After some debate in the 1980s when the notion was first proposed, critics seem to agree that Aladdin's Palace is a \\"male brothel\\", including Elizabeth Hardwick who describes it as \\"a strange, fastidiously observed, rococo urban landscape unlike any other dramatic intrusion in Melville's writings or in American literature at the time.\\" Following Hardwick, critic Evan Lang Pandya argued that Aladdin's Palace draws on \\"fantasies of the blank Arabian signifier, the obscure desert of ambiguities, including sexual ambiguity.\\" In addition to the social criticism of the Launcelott's Hey incident (Ch. 37), Melville attacks the evils of alcohol and the exploitation of emigrants by shipping services. The chapter \\"A Living Corpse\\", like Charles Dickens' Bleak House, contains an example of spontaneous human combustion in literature (Ch. 48). References  Sources  * Blum, Hester.

In the album's three parts, \\"Dogs\\", \\"Pigs\\" and \\"Sheep\\", pigs represent the people whom Roger Waters considers to be at the top of the social ladder, the ones with wealth and power; they also manipulate the rest of society and encourage them to be viciously competitive and cut-throat, so the pigs can remain powerful. Summary The song's three verses each present a different \\"pig\\", the identities of which remain a subject of speculation because only the third verse clearly identifies its subject as being morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who is described as a \\"house proud town mouse\\" who has to \\"keep it all on the inside.\\" In 1992, on the Westwood One radio special Pink Floyd: The 25th Anniversary Special, Roger Waters told Jim Ladd that the \\"Whitehouse\\" mentioned had nothing to do with the home of the U.S. President, the White House, after Ladd told Waters he interpreted the last verse as an attack on Gerald Ford, who was US president at the time the song was recorded. Halfway through the song, David Gilmour uses a Heil talk box on the guitar solo to mimic the sound of pigs. This is the first use of a talk box by Pink Floyd. Gilmour also plays a fretless bass guitar, with a pick, doing two short, syncopated bass solos‚Äîone before the first verse, another before the third. When the final verse ends and a guitar solo emerges, the bass line moves into a driving eighth note rhythm, sliding up and down the E minor scale in octaves, beneath the chords of E minor and C major seventh.Guitar World, Issue #22 Roger Waters, usually the band's bassist, played a rhythm guitar track on the song instead. Although it was not made available for commercial purchase, promotional copies were released in Brazil, albeit in an edited form of only four minutes and five seconds in length. In some cassette tape versions of the album, this song was divided into two parts after the first verse, fading out on side one and fading back in on side two, in order to minimize the total length of tape. Live versions The normal length of the song performed live was roughly 17 minutes (some would top out at 20 minutes), compared with the album length of 11 minutes and 28 seconds. Live renditions basically followed the album version with a few notable differences: an extra guitar solo was played after the second verse, the talk-box solo on guitar was substituted with a Minimoog solo and to the coda were added a quiet Hammond- led section and a crescendo reprise of the guitar solo with aggressive drumming. Waters, who sang on both the studio and live versions of \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\", also added his signature screams throughout live performances of this song during the 1977 tour. While playing on the 1977 tour, Waters shouted a different number for each concert. This purportedly had the purpose of identifying bootleg recordings. Also, Snowy White would play bass guitar while Waters played rhythm electric guitar with his black with white pickguard Fender Stratocaster. When this song was performed in Montreal on 6 July 1977, a disruptive fan angered Waters by throwing a beer bottle onto the stage. While the band played toward the climax of the song's jam section, Waters called the fan onto the stage through the microphone, then spat in his face after pretending to help him up. This concert, of which bootleg recordings exist, has been cited as a catalyst for Pink Floyd's next album, The Wall. In 1987, on tour to promote his solo album Radio K.A.O.S., Waters performed a shortened version of the song, featuring only the first two verses and shorter guitar solos between them as part of an extended Pink Floyd medley. Waters played Gilmour's original bass parts rather than rhythm guitar, and would do so again on all subsequent live performances. Waters would not play the song live again until 2016, on a brief tour of the US and Mexico. These performances were almost identical to the studio version and were accompanied by a large amount of anti-Donald Trump imagery, including caricatures, displays of controversial quotes by Trump, and the words \\"Fuck Trump\\" (changed to \\"Trump Is a Pig\\" on some dates) displayed at the end of the song. The song remained in Waters' setlist for his 2017 Us + Them Tour, once again being played in its entirety and with the anti-Trump images. While the response to the anti-Trump images has been mostly positive, some fans at his shows have booed or even walked out during the song over their anger at the anti-Trump images and political message. Waters responded to the anti-Trump critics saying \\"I find it slightly surprising that anybody could have been listening to my songs for 50 years without understanding\\" and said to those critics if they didn't like what he was doing \\"go see Katy Perry or watch the Kardashians. I don't care.\\" Waters also said that, due to his anti-Trump images, he lost sponsors such as American Express who refused to have their company associated with his shows.

Held annually in Cannes, France, it was instituted in 1932 and often regarded as the unofficial time trial championship of the world and as a Classic cycle race. The race was the idea of a Parisian newspaper editor called Gaston B√©nac. The beret-wearing sports editor was looking for a race to make a name for Paris-Soir, the biggest French evening paper before the war. He and his colleague Albert Baker d'Isy had been inspired by the world road race championship in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1931. That, unusually, had been run as a time trial, and the two were impressed and also, they said, aware that a time-trial cost less to organise than a conventional road race. Baker d'Isy decided the name Grand Prix des Nations. There is a dispute over who devised the first route. The American-French writer Ren√© de Latour said in the UK magazine Sporting Cyclist that he did; Baker d'Isy says that he did. The route started near the Versailles ch√¢teau and ran round a triangle through Rambouillet, Maulette, Saint-R√©my-les-Chevreuse, Versailles and Boulogne to finish on the V√©lodrome Buffalo where the founder of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, had become the world's first hour record holder in 1893. There were three hills, one in the first 100 km, plenty of cobbles, and the last 40 km went through the woods of the Vall√©e de Chevreuse, a popular area for bike riders. The distance was 142 km. The introduction of an official time trial champion at the UCI Road World Championships in 1994 and an Olympic individual time trial championship (1996) reduced its importance. With the introduction of the UCI ProTour in 2005, the event was removed from the calendar. History Race distances have varied. Until 1955, it was approximately 140 km; six years later, the distance was 100 km; from 1965 onwards the distance rarely exceeded 90 km, with many events run of around 75 km. The events were in the Vall√©e de Chevreuse in the Paris area, then near Cannes on the French Riviera; for five years from 1993, it was held at the Madine Lake in the Meuse; from 1998, it has taken place in Seine-Maritime d√©partement, two circuits of 35 km around Dieppe. The roll of honour includes cycling's greatest time trialists, but the event's history was dominated by two Frenchmen: Jacques Anquetil won nine times, Bernard Hinault five. British amateur woman Beryl Burton competed in 1968, finishing only minutes behind her male rivals.

He made a comeback in 2008 to play for the Philadelphia Soul in the Arena Football League. High school and college careers Watts was a four-year letterman in football at Banneker High School, as well as in basketball and track.

Watts played 48 career games at Marshall, he recorded 272 receptions for 4,031 yards (14.8 avg.) and 47 touchdowns. His 272 career receptions ranked fifth all-time in NCAA Division I-A history and were a Mid- American Conference record while only Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech (50 in 1996-98) had more touchdown receptions in a career in NCAA Division I-A history than Watts' MAC-record 47 career touchdowns. Additionally, his 4,031 career receiving yards were topped only by Mike Barber (4,262, 1985‚Äì88) in school history. In 2000, Watts was one of only two true freshmen to play for Marshall, starting four games to record 36 catches for 616 yards (17.1 avg.) with six touchdowns. He earned First-team All-MAC honors in 2001 as a sophomore, and was one of 11 semifinalists for the Biletnikoff Award, recording career-highs in receptions (91) and receiving yards (1,417), a 15.6 yards-per-reception average, along with an NCAA-high 18 touchdowns that ranked third on the school's single-season list. His 91 receptions ranked fourth all- time in school history for a single-season, and he recorded the most catches in a season since Marshall returned to Division I-A competition by passing the 90 receptions by Randy Moss in 1997.

History  Room service has dated back many centuries in various early forms of rooms service depending on the hotel, early forms had the customer personally go to the receptionists to be provided such services. It was rare for hotels to provide room services, as this was usually a service only high-class hotels have. The Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York which was already a symbol of fame and distinction after its construction during the late 19th century., specifically the new Waldorf which opened in 1931 in another location, this new Waldorf was the first to introduced room service as well as introducing other advancements into the industry such as reservations at the restaurant and full electrical wiring. Nowadays room service is now considered a necessity for any hotel and even to have this type of service become a worldwide occurrence. To address clinical issues and reduce mortality rates related to nutritional issues, the Mater Private Hospital Brisbane in Australia, became the first to offer room service in a hospital setting in 2013, providing more appropriate nutrition at an affordable price point. Though as technology advances, hotel customer services continue to evolve, allowing hotels to provide all customers room service and even including more options. Standards Organizations tend to have their own standards for room service, as there are no universally held best practices as they differ from business to business and the best practice depends on the guest's perspective, but generally it can be considered the guest's ability to order a meal, the meal being prepared and be served the product in the privacy of their own room as to maximize the customers comfort. =Occupations= A variety of hotel staff categories work on room service. Hotel management The role of hotel management in regards to room service is to ensure guest satisfaction and to address any complaints and queries that may arise.

They assist chefs as they cook, evaluate the quality of ingredients, and place orders with suppliers. In addition, they schedule the delivery of food or beverages and supervise kitchen production as part of their duties. Kitchen staff usually have a large range of jobs within the fast-paced kitchen, though they are mostly used to assist head cooks and other staff members with the meal preparation. Basic food preparation includes organizing the kitchen and ingredient preparation to make cooking and presenting the meal as efficient as possible, though it also includes washing, cutting and peeling. They also properly store the ingredients in the kitchen, storeroom and cold storage even moving supplies if necessary, proper cleaning and sanitizing of equipment, dishes, floors, counter-tops and cutting boards to maintain sanitation and health standards.

History Founded in 1838, it emerged from a settlement, built around a monastery, which belonged to the Neckar Community in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. In 1886, Maulbronn officially became a German town and was an administrative centre until 1938. The return of many displaced persons following the Second World War significantly raised the local population. Of particular note is the town's monastery, Maulbronn Abbey, which features prominently in Hermann Hesse's novel, Beneath the Wheel. The former Cistercian monastery has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. Legend has it that the settlement was founded by monks who followed a mule to a valley with a source of clean water. The valley was also blessed with large deposits of soft sandstone for building. The monks built the original abbey and erected a fountain to honour the mule. The town name means mule fountain. According to legend, the monks of Maulbronn also invented the pasta dish Maultasche.http://www.thelocal.de/national/20091023-22769.html Activities Maulbronn has a beautiful lake which is called \\"Tiefersee\\" which stands for \\"deep lake\\".

As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. The term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language. Baker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language.

Early life According to the hagiography The Life of St. Grellan, Grellan lived during the 5th century time of Saint Patrick. Grellan was assigned a site to build a church at Achadh Fionnabhrach, by Duach Gallach, a King of Connacht. Duach Gallach granted Grellan the site to build his church after Grellan brought back to life by baptism Duach Gallach's stillborn son, Eoghan Sriabh. Achadh Fionnabhrach has been ever since called Craobh Ghreall√°in (Irish for 'the branch of Grellan'), named after the branch which king Duach and St. Patrick presented to St. Grellan, in token of possession. The king also ordered that seven garments should be given from every chieftain's wife as a tribute to the young cleric. After this Grellan proceeded to the upper third of Connacht and continued to traverse the country but he eventually settled and established a church at Cill Cluaine (or Kilclooney, near present- day Ballinasloe) in Magh Seincheineoil, a territory occupied by the Firbolg and led by Cian d'Fhearaibh Bolg. Intervention in Fir Bolg-Colla da Chrioch battle The area was invaded by the Gaelic tribe of Colla da Chrioch from the Kingdom of Oriel, led the semi-legendary figure Maine M√≥r who was accompanied by his father, Eochaidh Ferdaghiall, and his two sons Breasal mac Maine M√≥r and Amhalgaidh. His battalions descended on the territory and plundered the country. Acting as an intermediary, Grellan negotiated a peace between the parties. To consummate the peace, Cian d'Fhearaibh Bolg organised a feast to which Amlaff was invited but subsequently taken hostage. Amlaff was now the bargaining power the Firbolgs held over the Gaels. While in captivity however, Amlaff managed offend a Firbolg official through a romantic entanglement with his wife. Amlaff was killed, and with him died the Firbolg's leverage against the Gaels. With the Gaels expecting a truce, Cian decided to catch them off guard with a surprise attack. From the door of his church, Grellan became aware of the build-up of the Firbolg's weapons. As he was the guarantee between the two factions, this development put him in a precarious situation. Legend states that he prayed to God, who caused the Firbolgs to be swallowed into the earth at the bog of Magh Liach during battle with the Gaels. Grellan subsequently granted the territory to Maine M√≥r and his people. The area became known as U√≠ Maine. The U√≠ Maine paid tribute to Grellan, who became the patron saint of the clans and families who descended from Maine M√≥r, including the √ì Ceallaigh (O'Kelly), √ì Madadhan (Madden), √ì Neacht√°in (Naughton), √ì Domhnall√°in (Donnellan), √ì Maolalaidh (Lally/Mullally) and √ì Fallamh√°in (Fallon) families. Crozier St. Grellan's Crozier, or Bachall Greall√°in was given to the U√≠ Maine with the territory, and was thenceforth borne in their standard on the battlefield. This crozier was in existence up to the early 19th century.O'Donovan, Tribes and Customs of Hy Many, p. 81‚Äì82, n. p. The history of the Baƒãall ƒ†reall√°n is recounted by Patrick Egan in his history of \\"The Parish of Ballinasloe,\\" from the time of the saint, during its time as a treasured relic of the Hy Many, until it was conveyed into the possession of Shane Crannelly as hereditary keeper of the relic, according to John O'Donovan writing in Ballinasloe in 1837. At this time, the Baƒãall was used as a talisman in depositions. The following year Thomas O'Curry arrived in the bally per the Ordnance Survey to learn that the Crozier of St. ƒ†reall√°n had been condemned and discarded. Crannelly's kin had inherited the staff; attended church; heard Father O'Connor's sermon against their family for charging fees to swear oaths on the Baƒãall; after which the treasure disappeared. Egan concludes the mystery thus \\"a treasured relic from the dawn of Christianity in Ireland, though handed down with loving care through thirteen centuries, was in the end put to base use, before finally disappearing from sight, perhaps forever.\\" Use of name in modern times St Grellan's Gaelic football club is named after Grellan, as is St Grellan's Terrace, a public housing estate, in Ballinasloe. St Grellan's Boys' National School, now Scoil an Chro√≠ Naofa, was also named in his honour. Also in Ballinasloe, Grellan's Well is located in the townland of Tobergrellan (meaning Grellan's Well).

Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá (; 14 January 1897 ‚Äì 11 June 1990) was a Bosnian Serb scholar and politician. As a teenager, he joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia and was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914. His brother, Veljko, was also involved in the plot. ƒåubriloviƒá was convicted of treason by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and given a sixteen-year sentence; his brother was sentenced to death and executed. ƒåubriloviƒá was released from prison at war's end and studied history at the universities of Zagreb and Belgrade. In 1937, he delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he advocated the expulsion of the Albanians from Yugoslavia. Two years later, he became a history professor at the University of Belgrade. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, ƒåubriloviƒá was arrested by the Germans and sent to the Banjica concentration camp, where he remained imprisoned for much of the war. As World War II drew to a close, ƒåubriloviƒá urged the Yugoslav authorities to expel ethnic minorities (particularly Germans and Hungarians) from the country. At war's end, he became a government minister. In his position as Minister of Agriculture, he pushed for the implementation of agricultural reforms. In his later years, he distanced himself from the Pan-Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth and expressed regret over Franz Ferdinand's assassination. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill the Archduke. Chetnik Vaso Cubrilovic was one of the Yugoslav scholars who conducted studies on the disappearance of Albanians. His study is known as The Expulsion of Albanians. Vaso Cubrilovic was among the main perpetrators of massacres of the Albanian civilian population in their lands. Early life Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá was born in Bosanska Gradi≈°ka on 14 January 1897. His was a well known family from the region of Bosanska Krajina. He was a relative of Vaso Vidoviƒá, a leader of the 1875‚Äì77 Herzegovina Uprising who attended the Congress of Berlin. ƒåubriloviƒá finished primary school in his hometown. He went on to attend the Tuzla High School but was expelled for refusing to stand during the Austro-Hungarian national anthem. He subsequently enrolled in the sixth class of the Sarajevo Gymnasium. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and World War I ƒåubriloviƒá in Austro-Hungarian police custody, October 1914. ƒåubriloviƒá had been a member of Young Bosnia prior to the outbreak of World War I. He and his older brother were involved in the conspiracy to assassinate of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914. The younger ƒåubriloviƒá was the youngest of the conspirators. He was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosanska Dubica on 3 July. The main conspirators were tried in a military prison in Sarajevo. The state attorney charged twenty-two of the accused with high treason and first-degree murder and three with complicity to commit murder. The trial began on 12 October and lasted until 23 October. ƒåubriloviƒá was only 17 years and six months old at the time. The ƒåubriloviƒá brothers, Ivo Kranjƒçeviƒá and Neƒëo Keroviƒá were defended by the lawyer Rudolf Cistler. At the trial, ƒåubriloviƒá stated that the mistreatment of South Slavs by the Habsburgs motived him to take part in the plot. \\"I can state that the monarchy is ruled by the Germans and the Magyars while the Slavs are oppressed,\\" he said. Asked if he identified as a Serb or a Croat, ƒåubriloviƒá declared himself a Serbo-Croat. \\"It means I don't consider myself solely a Serb,\\" he explained, \\"but that I must work for Croatia as well as for Serbia.\\" Though the trial ended on 23 October, sentencing did not occur until five days later. ƒåubriloviƒá was convicted of treason and given a sixteen-year sentence. He had initially been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. When asked his religious beliefs, he identified as an atheist, prompting the judges to add another three years. A further three were added after he refused to express remorse for the Archduke's death and blamed Austria-Hungary for starting the war. His brother Veljko was sentenced to death and hanged. ƒåubriloviƒá was initially sent to serve out his sentence in Zenica. On 2 March, he and some of his co- conspirators were relocated to the M√∂llersdorf military prison, near Vienna. They were re-tried in Travnik on 14 June 1915, and had several years added to their sentences. ƒåubriloviƒá was subsequently moved back to M√∂llersdorf. On 13 September 1917, the authorities decided to move almost all the surviving conspirators to Zenica prison. He remained imprisoned in Zenica until the end of the war. Interwar period ƒåubriloviƒá completed his high school education in Sarajevo in 1919. First, he enrolled at the University of Zagreb to study history, but later transferred to the University of Belgrade, where he received a Bachelor's degree in history in 1922. In 1929, he obtained his Ph.D at the University of Belgrade with a thesis titled \\"The Bosnian Uprising 1875‚Äì1878\\". In the meantime, he had worked as a history teacher at high schools in Sremska Mitrovica, Sarajevo and Belgrade. The historian Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá subsequently selected ƒåubriloviƒá as his personal assistant. In 1934, ƒåubriloviƒá became a docent at the university. From 1921 to 1939, he was an active member of the Agrarian Party. In 1937, ƒåubriloviƒá delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he outlined possible methods the Yugoslav government could use to coerce Albanians into leaving Kosovo. ƒåubriloviƒá argued that the only way to \\"deal\\" with the Albanians was to use the \\"brute force of an organized state\\". \\"If we do not settle accounts with them,\\" he opined, \\"in 20‚Äì30 years we shall have to cope with a terrible irredentism.\\" He was highly critical of government attempts to colonize parts of Kosovo as he felt they were ineffective. ƒåubriloviƒá also criticized the government for not having seized the opportunity presented by a 1918‚Äì21 revolt among Kosovo Albanians to force them out of the region. He stated that the benefits of the forced expulsion of Albanians outweighed any risk since \\"a threat to Yugoslav security would be removed\\". He reasoned: \\"At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the shifting of a few Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war.\\" The content of the lecture was preserved in writing, came into the possession of Yugoslavia's military intelligence service and was preserved at the Military Archive in Belgrade. In the ensuing decades, Albanian historians have referred to it as evidence of a plot to evict Kosovo's Albanian population, usually claiming it was written at the request of the Yugoslav General Staff. However, there is no evidence to this effect. Professor Sabrina P. Ramet doubts the lecture had much influence on the Yugoslav authorities, who were already long committed to seeing Kosovo Albanians leave the province and emigrate to Turkey. World War II and later life In 1939, ƒåubriloviƒá became a professor at the University of Belgrade. In April 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia, and ƒåubriloviƒá was arrested by the Gestapo in the coastal town of Risan. From there, he was transferred to Belgrade and imprisoned at the Banjica concentration camp, where he spent much of the war. Once German forces had been forced out of Serbia, ƒåubriloviƒá became an advisor to Yugoslavia's new communist leader, Josip Broz Tito. The anti-Serb pogroms of World War II, particularly those orchestrated by the Albanians, again directed ƒåubriloviƒá's attention to the status of Yugoslavia's national minorities. On 17 November 1944, in Belgrade, ƒåubriloviƒá presented a memorandum titled \\"The Minority Problem in the New Yugoslavia\\" () to the communist authorities. In it, he advised Tito's government to expel all of Yugoslavia's Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Romanians and Albanians. Indeed, virtually all ethnic Germans living in the country were forced out, as were many Hungarians and Romanians. \\"The minority problem,\\" ƒåubriloviƒá wrote, \\"if we don't solve it now, will never be solved.\\" At the time, such suggestions did not come across as particularly radical given that they coincided with the mass expulsion of Germans from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. In early 1945, ƒåubriloviƒá was appointed Minister of Agriculture in Tito's government. In August of that year, he pushed for the implementation of the Law on State Agricultural Farms, which emphasized the need to undertake economic measures that would rebuild and strengthen Yugoslavia's agricultural sector. ƒåubriloviƒá was later appointed Minister of Forestry. In 1959, he became a correspondent of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU), and in 1961, he was granted full membership. ƒåubriloviƒá was also a correspondent of the Yugoslav and Bosnian academies of sciences and arts, and a regular member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1976, he became an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In his later years, ƒåubriloviƒá distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth. Referring to Franz Ferdinand's assassination, he said: \\"We destroyed a beautiful world that was lost forever due to the war that followed.\\" In 1986, he expressed public disapproval of the SANU memorandum, which argued that Yugoslavia's Serbs were being discriminated against and called for a fundamental reorganization of the state.

Cardross is in the historic geographical county of Dunbartonshire but the modern political local authority of Argyll and Bute. Cardross Village took its name from the historic parish in which it is located and where King Robert the Bruce lived the final years of his life. The Parish of Cardross stretched in area from the River Leven on the west side of Dumbarton to Camus Eskan (near Helensburgh), and stretched as far north to include the village of Renton in the Vale of Leven. The distinction between Cardross village and Cardross Parish is particularly important for students of Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce's documented association with ‚ÄôCardross‚Äô occurred three centuries prior to the existence of the modern-day village, and at a time when the name referred to the ecclesiastical parish and its church, Cardross Kirk. The original piece of land known as ‚ÄôCardross‚Äô is at the eastern edge of the historic parish and the western point of the confluence of the rivers Clyde and Leven at the town of Dumbarton, facing across to Dumbarton Rock and Castle. Today the land is known as ‚Äúsand point‚Äù and sits on the edge of Dumbarton's Levengrove Park. The site of medieval Cardross Kirk, and its remains, sits within Levengrove Park. Etymology Cardross is a name of Brittonic origin. The first part of the name is the Brittonic or Pictish *carden, generally meaning \\"a wild place, a thicket\\" (Middle Welsh cardden). The second is the element -r≈çs, \\"moor, promontory\\" (Welsh rhos). In other words, a thicketed promontory of land. History The settlement of Cardross developed around a 17th-century church. The mother kirk of Cardross Parish was relocated in 1653, west from its medieval site on the western bank of the River Leven to support a fledgling ferry community on the northern bank of the River Clyde. Modern-day ‚ÄòFerry Road‚Äô runs the short distance between the A814 and the River Clyde at the easternmost extremity of Cardross Village (closest to Dumbarton). The new settlement eventually took its name from the church, and the parish that it served, as the 17th-century worshippers headed for the re-located ‚ÄòCardross‚Äô every Sunday. Today no remains of that original Cardross Village church can be found but the Graveyard is still in use and contains several 17th-century gravestones. Robert the Bruce purchased the portions of lands of Pillanflatt from the Earl of Lennox, lying on the western bank of the River Leven, Dunbartonshire, in the Parish of Cardross, in 1326. In 1329, he died at the manorial house that he built there. A field on the bank of River Leven south of the village of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, called the Mains of Cardross, is thought to have been the location of his royal manor, none of which remains today.Strathleven Artizans: Robert the Bruce King of Scots In 2017, Dumbarton Football Club's proposed new stadium was refused planning permission, with one of the objections being its likely placement on the medieval Bruce site. Natural history north-west of Cardross is a peninsula called Ardmore Point. This privately owned area of land has a nature trail and is considered a Regionally Important Geographical Site (RIGS) due to unique rock formations including an exposed sea cliff.The Geology of Ardmore Point It is a popular fishing and bird-spotting area and grey seals can also be seen here.

There is also a ruined church, which was bombed in May 1942 during World War 2. The reason for Cardross being targeted by German bombers remains unclear, locals have speculated buildings in the village might have been mistaken as a shipyard or an oil storage facility. =Religion= The village has two places of worship: Cardross Parish Church (Church of Scotland) and a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to Saint Mahew. The original parish church was bombed during the Second World War and its ruins are located next to the former Church of Scotland manse.

Spiriferida is an order of extinct articulate brachiopod fossils which are known for their long hinge-line, which is often the widest part of the shell. In some genera (e.g. Mucrospirifer) it is greatly elongated, giving them a wing-like appearance. They often have a deep fold down the center of the shell. The feature that gives the spiriferids their name (\\"spiral-bearers\\") is the internal support for the lophophore; this brachidium, which is often preserved in fossils, is a thin ribbon of calcite that is typically coiled tightly within the shell. Spiriferids first appear in the Late Ordovician with the appearance of Eospirifer radiatus. They increased in diversity throughout the Silurian and underwent a dramatic evolutionary radiation during the Devonian period, reaching peak development in variety and numbers. Spiriferida survived the great Permian extinction, finally becoming extinct during the Early to Middle Jurassic. Fossils of this order are often preserved as pyrite.

Personal life Jimmy Valiant was born in Tullahoma as the youngest of five children of James and Effie Fanning. He later incorporated the names of his four sisters ‚Äì Louise, Christine, Charlena and Patrica ‚Äì into the spider web tattoo on his upper arm. He later moved to Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He married Clara, with whom he fathered three children: Robin, Rhonda, and Dana. With Monika, he has his first son Todd. With Felicia, he has his youngest son Handsome. He is now married to Angel. He has 6 grandchildren: Lonna, Jenae, Beau, Chassie, Clarissa and Delilah. Career Fanning started wrestling in 1964 as Big Jim Vallen. He went to the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1970s as Handsome Jimmy Valiant and formed a team with Johnny Valiant that would dominate the tag team scene for a while as WWWF Tag Team champions. In the later 1960s in the WWA, they were managed by Bobby Heenan.Heenan, B: \\"Bobby The Brain: Wrestling's Bad Boy Tells All.\\", page 18. Triumph Books, 2002. Valiant had entered the WWWF as a babyface, originally known as \\"Gentleman Jim Valiant,\\" but quickly switched to heel.DVD Jimmy Valiant 50th Pro Wrestling Anniversary Celebration, Disc 2, Copyright 2014 Howard Rogofsky He had title matches against champion Pedro Morales in secondary arenas, such as Philadelphia, and feuded with short-term tag partner Chief Jay Strongbow. Jimmy and his kayfabe brother Johnny held the tag belts and main evented Madison Square Garden against Chief Jay Strongbow and Bruno Sammartino (Strongbow and Sammartino won 2 out of 3 falls, but one fall via disqualification; hence the belts didn't change hands). During the late 1970s ‚Äì early 1980s, Valiant was a central player in the Memphis, Tennessee wrestling scene. He feuded regularly with Jerry Lawler and teamed with Bill Dundee to dominate the tag team matches of that time. He even recorded a song, \\"The Ballad of Handsome Jimmy\\", which was used in wrestling arenas as his entry music and became a mainstay on some Memphis radio stations for a few years. Despite the Memphis promotion desperately wanting to keep him in Memphis full-time, even offering to buy him a house in Memphis according to Jerry Lawler's biography, Valiant decided to move on after holding the AWA Southern Heavyweight title for roughly a year. Valiant also spent a brief amount of time in Jim Crockett Promotions in the late 1970s as the heel King James Valiant managed by Lord Alfred Hayes.http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/interviews/valiant/valiant01.htm In the early 1980s, Valiant returned as a babyface to NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions as \\"Boogie Woogie Man\\" Jimmy Valiant and called his fans \\"The Street People\\". His theme music around this time was \\"Boy From New York City\\", by The Manhattan Transfer. While in Jim Crockett Promotions, he would sometimes appear in a black bandit-style mask and call himself Charlie Brown from Outta Town. This usually occurred when Valiant was (in kayfabe) banned from wrestling. Charlie Brown was billed as someone other than Valiant, despite \\"Brown\\" having Valiant's legendarily prodigious beard. January 1984, Valiant was attacked by Paul Jones and The Assassins. They tied him to the wrestling ring ropes so that Jones could cut his beard off. This led to a grudge match (with hyped supershow called 'Boogie Man Jam '84' in Greensboro, North Carolina. For this match, Dusty Rhodes was in Valiant's corner and tied by a rope to Paul Jones. Valiant defeated Assassin II, who was unmasked and revealed as Hercules Hernandez. Due to the beard cutting attack, he feuded heavily with Paul Jones and his army of wrestlers, from 1984 through to late 1986. This army of wrestlers included The Barbarian, Baron von Raschke, Teijo Khan, and The Assassins. During this three-year feud, Valiant received help from H√©ctor Guerrero and \\"Raging Bull\\" Manny Fernandez. Although Jimmy Valiant would lose a Loser Leaves Town Tuxedo Street Fight to Paul Jones at Starrcade 1984 in Greensboro, North Carolina the feud with many from the Paul Jones stable continued, which would come to include Abdullah The Butcher. In 1985, Valiant and Ragin' Bull Manny Fernandez formed a team called B and B Connection (\\"Boogie Woogie\\" and \\"Bull\\"). During The Great American Bash 1986 summer shows, Paul Jones adopted a military style look in his long feud with Valiant and labeled his stable of wrestlers The Army. Valiant would beat Shaska Whatley in a hair vs hair match, but with outside interference lost a hair vs hair match to Paul Jones only weeks later. In the fall of 1986, The Ragin Bull Manny Fernandez, Valiant's best friend accepted Jones' money and turned on Valiant, starting a feud between the two. Paul Jones at this point shortened his army to his newly acquired tag team of Ragin Bull and Rick Rude. The war between Valiant and Paul Jones climaxed at Starrcade 1986 with Valiant putting up the hair of his valet Big Mama against the hair of Paul Jones in a No DQ Match which Valiant won (while the Ragin Bull was placed in a cage above the ring). In the late 1980s, he teamed with Hector Guerrero (then masked as Laser Tron) and Bugsy McGraw and feuded with The New Breed. When Jim Crockett Promotions became WCW, Valiant left and returned to Memphis to wrestle in the USWA. In 1990 he twice won the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship from Jerry Lawler, losing it back to him both times. Since then, Valiant has primarily wrestled in independent promotions, having his most recent match on March 2, 2019 in Johnson City, Tennessee. He now enjoys his time with his wife Angel and training wrestlers at Boogie's Wrestling Camp located in Shawsville, Virginia. Jimmy currently wrestles under the ACW Banner (American Championship Wrestling) around the Roanoke Virginia Area. He has also recently wrestled with George South, Stan Lee and Ricky Morton in ASW Wrestling and New OCW in Ashland, KY with Matty B and Violet Rayne against Beau and Misty James and Scotty Ace. Valiant remains in the wrestling world today with continuing to appear at independent shows signing autographs while his students appear in a few matches on the card. He keeps in touch with fans through his official Weekly website.And he is especially looking forward to stepping into the ring in 2020 and continuing his decades long career officially beginning his 7th decade in the business. Most recently, Valiant lent his name to a foreword for a fiction novel called \\"Only The Beginning\\". It is a book set in the 1980s about a girl's life during high school. While the book is not wrestling related, the author Jason Strecker is a personal friend of Valiant's and in the forward Valiant responds to his friendship with the author along with the book's message of being of strong character and doing positive actions for others.

He was a starter on the 1964 Michigan team that won the Big Ten Conference championship and defeated Oregon State in the 1965 Rose Bowl. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player in 1965 and was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2006. Mack was selected by the Los Angeles Rams with the second pick in the 1966 NFL Draft and played at the left guard position for the Rams for 13 seasons from 1966 to 1978. During his NFL career, Mack played in 11 Pro Bowls and appeared in 184 consecutive games, 176 as a starter, over 13 seasons. Early years Mack was born in 1943 in Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Cleveland Heights High School. He was the son of Ray Mack, a Cleveland native who played Major League Baseball as a second baseman from 1938 to 1947, including eight seasons with the Cleveland Indians.

While attending Michigan, Mack was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Los Angeles Rams Mack was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round, as the second overall pick, in the 1966 NFL Draft. During Mack's rookie season with the Rams, starter Don Chuy was injured during the fifth game of the season, allowing Mack to move into the lineup. He started nine games during the 1966 season and became a fixture for the Rams at the left guard position for the next 13 seasons. During his NFL career, Mack never missed a game due to injury, appearing in 184 consecutive contests, the third longest streak in Rams history behind Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood. During Mack's career with the Rams, the club enjoyed a .720 winning percentage with a won-lost-tie record of 129-48-7, won their division eight times (1967, 1969, and 1973-1978), and reached four NFC championship games. In 1973, the Rams scored led the NFL with 388 points (27.7 points/game). In 1974, the Rams lost to the Minnesota Vikings by four points in the 1974 NFC Championship Game, with a controversial penalty call against Mack costing the Rams a touchdown. The Rams had the ball at the one-yard line on second down when the Vikings' Alan Page made contact with Mack; the referee called illegal procedure on Mack, but replays showed that Mack had not moved. After the game, Mack insisted he had not moved but credited Page with \\"a smart play\\" in making contact since a penalty, if called against the Vikings, would have been meaningless. Mack was selected to 11 Pro Bowls, the first coming after his second season in 1967. He missed only one Pro Bowl appearance the rest of his career (1976).

In his 2007 article, sociologist Stefan Timmermans called the book \\"landmark\\". History and content When Strauss came to the medical school of the University of California, San Francisco, he looked for an interesting subject that would also get the attention of medical people. Visiting hospitals, he discovered that dying was a highly problematic issue. Strauss started field studies and six months later hired Glaser from Columbia University. Both researchers already had personal experience with the subject: Strauss had lost his mother and a friend in recent years, Glaser his father. Strauss and Glaser suspected early on that the expectation of death by both the dying and the relatives were a key to understanding the interactions between those people. Their choice of hospitals and stations allowed them to compare various kinds of expectations. On a premature infant station, mortality was high but the patients were not aware of their impending deaths, while on an oncology station, dying was slow and differences in the awareness of dying were very pronounced. The typical situations were again different for emergency rooms and geriatrics or pediatrics departments. Out of these field studies grew Awareness of Dying, a theory on the influence of awareness on the interaction with dying people. It differentiated between closed awareness, suspicion, mutual deception, and open awareness. The field studies had shown that the type of awareness had a significant impact on interaction -- for instance, if patients were not aware of their dying, the nursing was often limited to the absolutely necessary in order to prevent open awareness. Significance The book was the first application of grounded theory. Only two years later did Glaser and Strauss publish The Discovery of Grounded Theory, a book on the methodology they developed while working on Awareness of Dying.

It is defined as the irreversible loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Dental erosion is the most common chronic disease of children ages 5-17, although it is only relatively recently that it has been recognised as a dental health problem. There is generally widespread ignorance of the damaging effects of acid erosion; this is particularly the case with erosion due to fruit juices, because they tend to be seen as healthy. Acid erosion begins initially in the enamel, causing it to become thin, and can progress into dentin, giving the tooth a dull yellow appearance and leading to dentin hypersensitivity. The most common cause of erosion is by acidic foods and drinks. In general, foods and drinks with a pH below 5.0-5.7 have been known to trigger dental erosion effects. Numerous clinical and laboratory reports link erosion to excessive consumption of drinks. Those thought to pose a risk are soft drinks, some alcohol and fruit drinks, fruit juices such as orange juice (which contain citric acid) and carbonated drinks such as colas (in which the carbonic acid is not the cause of erosion, but citric and phosphoric acid). Additionally, wine has been shown to erode teeth, with the pH of wine as low as 3.0-3.8. Other possible sources of erosive acids are from exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water, and regurgitation of gastric acids. In children with chronic diseases, the use of medicines with acid components is a risk factor too. Dental erosion has also been recorded in the fossil record and was likely caused by the consumption of acidic fruits or plants. Causes Frequently eaten foods and drinks below pH 5.0-5.7 may initiate dental erosion. =Extrinsic acidic sources= Extrinsic acid erosion is when the source of acid originates from outside of the body. Acidic food and drink lowers the pH level of the mouth resulting in demineralisation of the teeth. A variety of drinks contribute to dental erosion due to their low pH level. Examples include fruit juices, such as apple and orange juices, sports drinks, wine and beer. Carbonated drinks, such as colas and lemonades, are also very acidic and hence have significant erosive potential. Foods such as fresh fruits, ketchup and pickled food in vinegar have been implicated in causing acid erosion. Frequency rather than total intake of acidic juices is seen as the greater factor in dental erosion; infants using feeding bottles containing fruit juices (especially when used as a comforter) are therefore at greater risk of acid erosion. Saliva acts as a buffer, regulating the pH when acidic drinks are ingested. Drinks vary in their resistance to the buffering effect of saliva. Studies show that fruit juices are the most resistant to saliva's buffering effect, followed by, in order: fruit-based carbonated drinks and flavoured mineral waters, non-fruit-based carbonated drinks, sparkling mineral waters; Mineral water being the least resistant. Because of this, fruit juices in particular, may prolong the drop in pH levels. A number of medications such as chewable vitamin C, aspirin and some iron preparations are acidic and may contribute towards acid erosion. Certain drugs can cause hypo-salivation which is considered a risk factor for acid erosion. =Intrinsic acidic sources= Intrinsic dental erosion, also known as perimolysis, is the process whereby gastric acid from the stomach comes into contact with the teeth. This is often secondary to conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and rumination syndrome. Dental erosion can also occur by non-extrinsic factors. There is evidence linking eating disorders with a range of oral health problems including dental erosion, caries and xerostomia. Reduced salivary flow rate, a common symptom of bulimia, predisposes an individual to dental erosion due to increased vulnerability to the effects of acidic food and drinks. Self-induced vomiting increases the risk of dental erosion by a factor of 5.5 compared to healthy controls. Lesions are most commonly found on the palatal surfaces of the teeth, followed by the occlusal and then the buccal surfaces. The main cause of GERD is increased acid production by the stomach. This is not exclusive to adults, as GERD and other gastrointestinal disorders may cause dental erosions in children. =Behaviour= Acid erosion often coexists with abrasion and attrition. Abrasion is most often caused by brushing teeth too hard. Any frothing or swishing acidic drinks around the mouth before swallowing increases the risk of widespread acid erosion. Sucking citrus fruits can also contribute to acid erosion. Diagnosis Dental erosion In-vivo studies are advantageous in assessing erosion directly from the patient's mouth. There are numerous signs of dental erosion, including changes in appearance and sensitivity. = Color = One of the physical changes can be the color of teeth. Dental erosion can lead to two major tooth colour change - the first being a change of color that usually happens on the cutting edge of the central incisors. This causes the cutting edge of the tooth to become transparent. A second sign is a yellowish tint on the eroded tooth. This occurs because the white enamel has eroded away to reveal the yellowish dentin beneath. On top of clinical examination, the dentist may take intra- oral photographs to monitor the extent and progress of erosion. Clinical photographs lead to comparable results to a visual examination, however both may result in an underestimation of the extent of tooth wear. = Shape = Dental study casts A change in shape of the teeth is also a sign of dental erosion. Teeth will begin to appear with a broad rounded concavity, and the gaps between teeth will become larger. There can be evidence of wear on surfaces of teeth not expected to be in contact with one another. If dental erosion occurs in children, a loss of enamel surface characteristics can occur. Amalgam restorations in the mouth may be clean and non-tarnished. As tooth substance around restorations erodes away, fillings may also appear to be rising out of the tooth. The teeth may form divots on the chewing surfaces when dental erosion is occurring. This mainly happens on the first, second, and third molars. To monitor the change in shape over time, dentists can create and retain accurate, serial study casts. Dentists may also employ dental indices to guide their diagnosis and management of the condition. A new scoring system referred to as Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) grades the appearance or severity of wear on the teeth by the extent of hard tissue loss. It is noted that indices are useful in monitoring the most severe clinical changes in tooth wear. However, they lack comprehensiveness as they cannot measure the rate of progression and cannot monitor all teeth affected by erosion. There is also a lack of an index which is universally accepted and standardised. One of the most severe signs of dental erosion is cracking, where teeth begin to crack off and become coarse. Other signs include pain when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods. This pain is due to the enamel having been eroded away, exposing the sensitive dentin. a) sample; (b) image under white light; (c) image under coherent light; (d) image with false colors; (e) LASCA method = Optical properties = Typical LASCA maps of; (a) eroded tissue; (b) sound tissue. Based on the optical changes induced in eroded tissue by the lesions, in 2015 Koshoji et al. also demonstrated in a novel method that using laser speckle images (LSI) it is possible to acquire information on the microstructure of the enamel and detect minimal changes, such as early non-carious lesions. To produce the erosion, the samples were divided into four groups and immersed in 30 mL of a cola-based beverage (pH approximately 2.5) at room temperature. A representative image of the samples under white and laser illumination shows that although there are visible stains in the left portion of each sample due to the dye from the cola beverage, structural changes are difficult to assess with the naked eye. To differentiate the sound and eroded tissues, contrast analysis was performed of the speckle patterns in the images. Since this analysis is, in its essence, the ratio of the standard deviation and average intensity, the LASCA map of the lesion is generally higher than in sound tissue. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the LASCA maps which show the greater prevalence of dark blue on the right side, indicating sound tissue, and lower prevalence on the left side, indicating eroded tissue. The contrast ratio of the LASCA maps demonstrates that laser speckle images are sensitive to even small changes in the microstructure of the surface. Erosion is highly prevalent in people of all ages. However, an objective diagnostic procedure is still needed, thus the study of the laser speckle imaging for tooth enamel may provide the first low cost objective diagnostic method for this disease. The analysis of laser speckle imaging in the spatial domain is a powerful diagnostic technique that provides information on the surface microstructure of tooth enamel after an acid etching procedure using patterns and LASCA maps. In an erosion model, these patterns are associated with mineral loss from the enamel. This method has proven sensitive to 10 minutes of acid etching on tooth enamel, which is a lesion so incipient that is not likely to be detected in clinical practice even by a trained dentist, besides it is also sensitive to the erosion progression. Prevention and management The causes of dental erosion are classified into two main categories ‚Äì intrinsic and extrinsic. The former is due to regurgitated gastric acid from the stomach while the latter is from dietary, medicinal, occupational & recreational origins. It is important to recognise it early, detect its cause and provide relevant advice or treatment to stop its progression. Strategies for prevention and management consist of the following: Where _intrinsic_ sources of acid have been identified: _A: What can the individual do?_ 1\\\\. Consult a medical doctor immediately if you notice or are aware of any signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), such as acid reflux and heartburn, or if you suffer from an eating disorder or chronic alcoholism. They can confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan accordingly. 2\\\\. Be cautious when purchasing the following items: vitamin C, iron-tonic and amino-acid tablets, aspirin, hydrogen chloride based preparations, asthma medications, mouthrinses with low pH, paediatric syrup medication, acidic salivary substitutes and bleaching agents. They can potentially lead to erosion. _B: Dental professionals‚Äô led prevention and treatment_ 3\\\\. Prescribe or administer a neutralising agent, such as antacid tablets in suspension. Antacids helps neutralise stomach acidity and inhibit proteolytic activity of pepsin, both of which provide relief to symptoms of GERD such as heartburn. Note that antacids may interfere with other medications and are not suitable for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, those that suffer from liver disease, kidney disease or heart failure and an illness associated with sodium control, such as high blood pressure or cirrhosis. 4\\\\. Encourage patients to maintain their body mass index (BMI) within normal range or by making healthy lifestyle changes in relation to diet and exercise. Obesity is said to be an important risk factor in the development and deterioration of GERD. 5\\\\. Find out if the patient has any underlying medical conditions or did consider a change of medications that induce hyposalivation and vomiting. If the patient displays severe signs or symptoms, referral to a medical doctor is necessary. Refer patients to a dietician for them to receive personalised dietary counselling if signs and symptoms still persist. 6\\\\. Request that patients complete the SCOFF questionnaire, a valid and reliable screening tool for early detection and treatment of suspected eating disorders. A response of ‚Äòyes‚Äô receives 1 point. An accumulative score of > 2 indicates the likelihood of anorexia or bulimia. The acronym SCOFF dictates the following questions: ‚óè Do you make yourself SICK because you feel uncomfortably full? ‚óè Do you worry you have lost CONTROL over how much you eat? ‚óè Have you recently lost more than ONE stone in a 3-month period? ‚óè Do you believe yourself to be FAT when others say you are too thin? ‚óè Would you say that FOOD dominates your life? _C: Industry led measures_ 7\\\\. Develop effective over-the-counter medications for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that minimise side effects of those presently available. For instance, some side effects antacids, H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have in common are constipation, diarrhea and nausea. Where _Extrinsic_ sources of acids have been identified _A: What can the individual do?_ 8\\\\. Reduce the frequency of acidic food intake which includes fizzy drinks and fruit juices that contain phosphoric or citric acid. Tooth enamel and dentine are both made up of calcium deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite. Acid and/or chelators present in the food we consume penetrate through the plague, the pellicle and the protein/ lipid coating into the individual crystals. Hydrogen ions combine with carbonate and/ or phosphate, releasing all ions in the affected region, giving rise to direct surface etching/ erosion. Reducing the frequency of intake, minimises the duration to which enamel is exposed to acids, making it less susceptible to acid attack and allows the eroded tooth surface to remineralise. Ideally, confine these items exclusively to mealtime. 9\\\\. Consume food items enriched with calcium or stimulates the flow of saliva. For instance, dairy products such as milk & cheese. Saliva acts as a buffer which resists abrupt changes in pH in the mouth and keeps it neutral. Moreover, it aids the precipitation of calcium phosphate under specific pH conditions and bathes the tooth surface in fluoride, both of which promote remineralisation. 10\\\\. Drink through a straw to reduce localised contact between erosive fluids and the teeth. Similarly, drinks should not be held in the mouth or sipped for a long period of time. Otherwise, rinse your mouth thoroughly with water or chew sugar-free gum immediately after as it removes residual food debris and lowers the pH of saliva. The result of salivary flow rate and salivary pH from chewing gum for 20 minutes is significantly greater than resting flow rate. 11\\\\. Avoid abrasive forces by brushing gently using a soft bristled hand toothbrush. In- vitro research has shown that there is a higher potential for abrasion on erosive enamel & dentine with an electric toothbrush as compared to a manual toothbrush. Furthermore, delay brushing of teeth until approximately an hour after an acidic meal to prevent the removal of softened tooth substance. 12\\\\. Use remineralising agents, such as sodium fluoride in the form of either a fluoride mouth rinse, toothpaste and varnish. Fluoride-containing products block exposed dentine tubules, reducing its permeability hence inducing hypersensitivity and pain. _B: Dental professionals_ 13\\\\. To facilitate detection and diagnosis, dental professionals should be aware of the appearance of tooth erosion ‚Äì short, cupped, saucer-shaped with a glassy, shiny surface and loss of surface architecture. Several teeth are affected at the same time, with the most commonly affected area being the tongue surfaces of the upper front teeth. 14\\\\. Recording index. Use the Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE), an objective four-level scoring system to determine the severity of erosion in each sextant. The cumulative score corresponds to its level of risk and acts as a guide for appropriate management. The distribution of BEWE scores is said to be more accurate than that of Tooth wear index (TWI) scores. ‚óè 0= no erosive tooth wear ‚óè 1= initial loss of surface texture ‚óè 2= distinct defect, hard tissue loss < 50% of surface area ‚óè 3= hard tissue loss ‚â• 50% of surface area 15\\\\. Treating dental erosion ‚Äì the first line treatment after detection of acid erosion is remineralisation. Remineralisation is the reparative process of tooth substance. It is commonly done by applying fluoride-containing substances onto the surfaces of affected teeth. The following are some methods of remineralization: professionally-applied fluoride varnish, home-applied fluoride gel and toothpaste with stannous fluoride formulation. There is evidence showing that toothpastes containing stannous fluoride is more remineralising when compared to conventional sodium fluoride formulations. 16\\\\. Restoration is the process of building back lost tooth structure to restore their function, integrity and morphology. The type of restorative treatment depends on the degree of damage that has been done: a. Small area of erosion along the biting surfaces of tooth can be restored using detection of acid erosion is resin composite filling. This is a tooth- coloured filling material commonly used to restore decayed teeth. b. Moderate degree of damage at upper from teeth can be restored using detection of acid erosion is ceramic or resin composite veneers. A veneer is a thin piece of tooth-coloured, custom-made shells that cover the front side of teeth. c. Large extent of damage, involving two or more surfaces of tooth can be restored using ceramic crowns or overlays. Crowns are tooth-shaped capsplaced over the damaged tooth to restore its shape; Overlays are pre-built fillings that are used to rebuild the pointed parts of back teeth (known as cusps). However, long-term treatment success is only possible when the causes of acid erosion are eradicated. Otherwise, the erosive process will continue to destroy tooth substance. To achieve best outcomes, combining active treatment with preventive measures and recall at regular periods is needed. _C: Industry_ 17\\\\. Avoid having environments where there is repeated exposure and inhalation of acidic particles in occupational areas when possible as several case reports have proven a link between this and the prevalence of dental erosion. Alternatively, subsidiseregular dental services for those with higher risk of developing the condition. For instance, professional wine tasters, competitive swimmers and industrial workers working in factories that involve batteries, galvanizing or ammunition. 18\\\\. Educate workers on potential occupational hazards and promote maintenance of good oral health. For instance, standardise behaviours such as wearing personal protective equipment for the eyes and face and gargling during or after working. 19\\\\. Alter pH or chelation properties of acidic soft drinks, particularly those with citric or phosphoric acid by reducing its composition. Tooth enamel is composed of calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite. Chelating agents like hydrogen ions combine with carbonate or phosphate releasing ions in the region, thereby causing direct surface etching hence tissue loss.

It was released as a non-album single, but appeared as the opening track of the U.S. edition of the band's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). \\"See Emily Play\\" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and reached No. 6 in the United Kingdom singles chart. As of 2018, the song has never been mixed to stereo, so the US album version was rechannelled and all subsequent reissues have been in mono. Content \\"See Emily Play\\" is also known as \\"Games for May\\", after a free concert in which Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd performed. The song was reportedly about a girl named Emily, who Barrett claimed to have seen while sleeping in the woods after taking a psychedelic drug. According to A Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey, by Nicholas Schaffner, Emily is the Honourable Emily Young,Biography , Emily Young Sculpture. daughter of Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet and nicknamed \\"the psychedelic schoolgirl\\" at the UFO Club.. It has been suggested by some that the slide guitar effect was produced by Barrett using a Zippo lighter, but elsewhere that he used a plastic ruler. The train depicted on the single's sleeve was drawn by Barrett. Recording The details as to the recording remain shrouded in mystery due to the lack of paperwork in the EMI archive. Engineer Jeff Jarrett recalls that \\"See Emily Play\\" was recorded in a much longer form which was then edited down for the single release. It was recorded at Sound Techniques studios on 21 May 1967. There was much trickery involved in the recording with backward tapes, much use of echo and reverb, and the first piano bridge between the first chorus and second verse was recorded at a slow pace then sped up for the final master. The four-track master tape was wiped or misplaced. It no longer exists and has never been mixed into true stereo; it was reprocessed for fake stereo on the 1971 Relics compilation. Barrett, reputedly, was not happy with the final studio cut, and he protested against its release, which producer Norman Smith speculated was based on his fear of commercialism. During sessions for the song David Gilmour visited the studio, on Barrett's invitation, and was shocked by the perceived changes in Barrett's personality when he did not appear to recognize him. For many years Gilmour would recall this, saying, \\"I'll go on record as saying, that was when he changed\\".  Release  The US single (Tower 356) was released by Tower Records three times between July 1967 and late 1968. Each time it failed to duplicate its UK success. The song only stayed in the band's set list for a few months, and was last played on 25 November 1967 in Blackpool. \\"See Emily Play\\" later appeared on a number of compilations: Relics (1971), Works (1983), Shine On (1992), Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd (2001), The Piper at the Gates of Dawn 40th Anniversary Edition (2007), The Best of Pink Floyd: A Foot in the Door (2011) and The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 (2016). The song was also included on the Barrett retrospective An Introduction to Syd Barrett (2010). Television performances =Top of the Pops, BBCTV, July 1967= Pink Floyd performed the song three times on BBC TV's Top of the Pops. On each occasion, they mimed to the single, over which Barrett sang a live vocal. The BBC wiped the shows all of which were \\"live\\" transmissions. In late 2009 a badly damaged home video recording was recovered by the British Film Institute containing the first and third show the song was performed on, though only the first appearance was recoverable in part. The first performance was on the 6 July 1967 edition hosted by Alan Freeman. Parts of this performance have been recovered from the damaged video recording. They returned for the following week's edition, 13 July, hosted by Pete Murray. Barrett complained that the band shouldn't appear, because \\"John Lennon doesn't have to do Top of the Pops\\". He did perform, but without the enthusiasm of the previous week. The recoverable parts of the 6 July performance were given a public screening in London on 9 January 2010 at an event called \\"Missing Believed Wiped\\" devoted to recovered TV shows. It was the first time any footage of the performance had been seen since its original broadcast. The Pink Floyd management used a copy of the footage in The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972. =Beat-Club, Radio Bremen, August 1967 (cancelled)= The band were booked to appear on this edition of Beat-Club. Barrett had suffered \\"nervous exhaustion\\" and the band decided to take a month-long break in the hope his health would recover. The appearance thus had to be cancelled. =Tienerklanken, VRT, February 1968= In 1968, Pink Floyd travelled to Belgium where they filmed a TV special for the Dutch-language television programme Tienerklanken. Erroneously titled \\"Pink Floid\\", this special featured lip-synched promotional films for \\"See Emily Play\\", as well as for \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"The Scarecrow\\", \\"Apples and Oranges\\", \\"Paint Box\\", \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", and \\"Corporal Clegg\\". This was Gilmour's first TV work with the band. Barrett was still technically a member of the band but it had recently been decided to no longer include him in gigs and shows. Gilmour, Roger Waters and Rick Wright thus had to mime to Barrett's vocals.  Legacy  Part of the vocal melody was played on a Minimoog by Rick Wright at the very end of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)\\" at the end of 1975's Wish You Were Here, as a tribute to Barrett. \\"See Emily Play\\" has been covered by Canadian group Three to One (aka Okee Pokey Band) on the 1967 Yorkville album CTV After Four; David Bowie, for his Pin Ups album in 1973; Japanese group Salon Music, for their 1984 album La Paloma Show; The Grapes of Wrath, as a B-side on the 1991 CD single \\"I Am Here\\"; on the 1996 Games for May EP by perfect children; Arjen Anthony Lucassen, on his 1997 album Strange Hobby; The Changelings, on their 2002 album Astronomica; Judy Dyble, for her album Spindle; David West, on the 2001 bluegrass tribute album Pickin' on Pink Floyd: A Bluegrass Tribute;Pickin on Pink Floyd: Bluegrass Tribute Martha Wainwright, on her 2008 album I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too; and by 3, on the 2008 re-release of their album The End Is Begun. John Frusciante has played it live. All About Eve played the song live c. 1992 and recorded a demo, which was not released until 2006 as part of the Keepsakes compilation. A parody appears on the 2013 album Cover Your Ears by French Canadian duo S√®xe Ill√©gal. The song is renamed \\"Si √âmile est gay\\" or \\"If Emile is gay\\". The song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018. \\"See Emily Play\\" is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\\" list. EP An EP including the song was released in Spain in 1967, on the La Voz De Su Amo label.

In 1987, a disputed State election created a catalyst for the insurgency when it resulted in some of the state's legislative assembly members forming armed insurgent groups. In July 1988, a series of demonstrations, strikes and attacks on the Indian government began the Kashmir insurgency, which during the 1990s escalated into the most important internal security issue in India. Pakistan claims to be giving its \\"moral and diplomatic\\" support to the separatist movement. The Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India and the international community of supporting, supplying arms and training mujahideen, to fight in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2015, former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf admitted that Pakistan had supported and trained insurgent groups in the 1990s. India has repeatedly called Pakistan to end its \\"cross-border terrorism\\" in Kashmir. Several new militant groups with radical Islamic views emerged and changed the ideological emphasis of the movement to Islamic. This had happened partly due to a large number of Islamic \\"Jihadi\\" fighters (mujahadeen) who had entered the Kashmir valley following the end of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in the 1980s. The conflict between the militants and the Indian forces have led to large number of casualties.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, Conflict Summary, India: Kashmir (entire conflict), Fatality estimates, viewed 2013-05-29, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=74&regionSelect;=6-Central_and_Southern_Asia# Many civilians have also died as a result of being targeted by the various armed groups.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, India One- sided violence, Government of India ‚Äì civilians, Kashmir insurgents ‚Äì civilians, Lashkar-e-Taiba ‚Äì civilians, viewed on 2012-05-29, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=74&regionSelect;=6-Central_and_Southern_Asia# According to official figures released in Jammu and Kashmir assembly, there were 3,400 disappearance cases and the conflict has left more than 47,000 people dead which also includes 7,000 police personnel as of July 2009. Some rights groups claim a higher figure of 100,000 deaths since 1989. Since the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, the indian military has intensified its counter-insurgency operations. Clashes in the first half of 2020 left 229 dead, including 32 civilians. The 283 people killed in all of 2019 was the highest toll for a decade.  History of the movement  = 1947‚Äì1987 = After independence from colonial rule India and Pakistan fought a war over the princely state of Kashmir. At the end of the war India controlled the most valuable parts of Kashmir. While there were sporadic periods of violence there was no organised insurgency movement. During this period legislative elections in Jammu and Kashmir were first held in 1951 and Sheikh Abdullah's secular party stood unopposed. He was an instrumental member in the accession of the state to India. However, Sheikh Abdullah would fall in and out of favour with the central government and would often be dismissed only to be re-appointed later on. This was a time of political instability and power struggle in Jammu and Kashmir, and it went through several periods of president's rule by the Federal Government. = 1987‚Äì2004 = The trend in total yearly civilian and security forces fatalities from insurgency-related violence over 25 years from 1988 to 2013.Fatalities in Terrorist Violence 1988‚Äì2014 in Jammu & Kashmir , South Asian Terrorism, SATP (2014) After Sheikh Abdullah's death, his son Farooq Abdullah took over as Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Farooq Abdullah eventually fell out of favour with the Central Government and the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had his government toppled with the help of his brother-in-law G. M. Shah. A year later, Abdullah reached an accord with the new Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and announced an alliance with the Congress party for the elections of 1987. The elections were allegedly rigged in favour of Abdullah. Most commentators state that this led to the rise of an armed insurgency movement composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost the elections. Pakistan supplied these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training. In the second half of 1989 the alleged assassinations of the Indian spies and political collaborators by JKLF (Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front) was intensified. Over six months more than a hundred officials were killed to paralyse government's administrative and intelligence apparatus. The daughter of then interior affairs minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was kidnapped in December and four terrorists had to be released for her release. This event led to mass celebrations all over the valley. Farooq Abdullah resigned in January after the appointment of Jagmohan Malhotra as the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, J&K; was placed under Governor's Rule under Article 92 of state constitution. Under JKLF's leadership on 21‚Äì23 January large scale protests were organised in valley. As a response to this largely explosive situation paramilitary units of BSF and CRPF were called. These units were used by the government to combat Maoist insurgency and the North-Eastern insurgency. The challenge to them in this situation was not posed by armed insurgents but by the stone pelters. Their inexperience caused at least 50 casualties in Gawkadal massacre. In this incident the underground militant movement was transformed into a mass struggle. To curb the situation AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) was imposed on Kashmir in September 1990 to suppress the insurgency by giving armed forces the powers to kill and arrest without warrant to maintain public order. During this time the dominant tactic involved killing of a prominent figure in a public gathering to push forces into action and the public prevented them from capturing these insurgents. This sprouting of sympathisers in Kashmir led to the hard-line approach of Indian army. With JKLF at forefront large number of militant groups like Allah Tigers, People's League and Hizb-i-Islamia sprung up. Weapons were smuggled on a large scale from Pakistan. In Kashmir JKLF operated under the leadership of Ashfaq Majid Wani, Yasin Bhat, Hamid Shiekh and Javed Mir. To counter this growing pro-Pakistani sentiment in Kashmir, Indian media associated it exclusively with Pakistan. JKLF used distinctly Islamic themes to mobilise crowds and justify their use of violence. They sought to establish an Islamic democratic state where the rights of minorities would be protected according to Quran and Sunna and economy would be organised on the principles of Islamic socialism. The Indian army has conducted various operations to control and eliminate insurgency in the region such as Operation Sarp Vinash, in which a multi-battalion offensive was launched against terrorists from groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami, al-Badr and Jaish-e- Mohammad who had been constructing shelters in the Pir Panjal region of Jammu and Kashmir over several years. The subsequent operations led to the death of over 60 terrorists and uncovered the largest network of militant hideouts in the history of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir covering 100 square kilometers. =Islamisation of Kashmir in early 1989= During the early period of militancy in 1989, multiple militants groups strive to Islamise Kashmiri culture and political setup to create a conducive environment for the merger of Kashmir with Pakistan. Numerous Islamist groups were formed in early 1990 who emerged advocating Nizam-e-Mustafa (Rule of Muhammad) as the objective for their struggle. Militant groups like Hizbul mujahideen and Jamaat-e-Islami asserted that struggle of Kashmir will continue till Islamic Caliphate is achieved in Kashmir. Murder of Kashmiri Hindus, Intellectuals, Liberals and activists were described necessary to get rid of un-Islamic elements. Concurrently all cinema houses, beauty parlours, wine shops, bars, video centres, use of cosmetics and similar things were banned by militant groups. Many militant organisations like Al baqr, People's league, Wahdat-e-Islam and Allah Tigers imposed restrictions like banning cigarettes, restrictions on Kashmiri girls. Apart from militants, Kashmir was witnessing Islamization during 1980's when Abdullah Government changed the names of about 2,500 villages from their native names to new Islamic names. The Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in mosques similar to his speeches in the 1930s. Additionally, he referred Kashmiri Pandits as \\"mukhbir\\" or informers of the Indian government. = 2004‚Äì11 = Beginning in 2004 Pakistan began to end its support for insurgents in Kashmir. This happened because terrorist groups linked to Kashmir twice tried to assassinate Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf. His successor, Asif Ali Zardari has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir \\"terrorists\\". Although it is unclear if Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, thought to be the agency aiding and controlling the insurgency is following Pakistan's commitment to end support for the insurgency in Kashmir. Despite the change in the nature of the insurgency from a phenomenon supported by external forces to a primarily domestic-driven movement the Indian government has continued to send large numbers of troops to the Indian border. There have been widespread protests against the Indian army presence in Kashmir. Once the most formidable face of Kashmir militancy, Hizbul Mujahideen is slowly fading away as its remaining commanders and cadres are being taken out on a regular interval by security forces. Some minor incidents of grenade throwing and sniper firing at security forces notwithstanding, the situation is under control and more or less peaceful. A record number of tourists including Amarnath pilgrims visited Kashmir during 2012. On 3 August 2012, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba militant commander, Abu Hanzulah involved in various attacks on civilians and security forces was killed in an encounter with security forces in a village in Kupwara district of north Kashmir. =2012‚Äìpresent= According to Indian Army data quoted by Reuters, at least 70 young Kashmiris joined the insurgency in the 2014, army records showed, with most joining the banned group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was accused of carrying out attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai in 2008. Two of the new recruits have doctorates and eight were post graduates, the army data showed. According to BBC, that despite a Pakistani ban on militant activity in Kashmir in 2006, its fighters continue to attempt infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir. These attempts were curtailed however when people living along the Line of Control which divides Indian and Pakistani Kashmir started to hold public protests against the activities of the insurgent groups. In June 2020, Doda was declared militancy free while Tral was declared free from Hizbul Mujaheddin militants. In July, a Kashmir police tweet from an official twitter handle said that \\"no resident of #Srinagar district in terrorist ranks now\\".  Reasons for the insurgency  =Rigging of 1987 Assembly elections= Following the rise of Islamisation in the Kashmir valley, during the 1987 state elections, various Islamic anti- establishment groups including Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir were organised under a single banner named Muslim United Front (MUF), that is largely current Hurriyat. MUF's election manifesto stressed the need for a solution to all outstanding issues according to Simla Agreement, work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre. Their slogan was wanting the law of the Quran in the Assembly. But the MUF won only four seats, even though it had polled 31% votes in the election. However, the elections were widely believed to be rigged, changing the course of politics in the state. The insurgency was sparked by the apparent rigging of state elections in 1987. = ISI's role = The Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence has encouraged and aided the Kashmir independence movement through an insurgency due to its dispute on the legitimacy of Indian rule in Kashmir, with the insurgency as an easy way to keep Indian troops distracted and cause international condemnation of India. Former Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf in Oct 2014 said during TV interview, \\"We have source (in Kashmir) besides the (Pakistan) army‚Ä¶People in Kashmir are fighting against (India). We just need to incite them.\\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in their first ever open acknowledgement in 2011 in US Court, said that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) sponsors terrorism in Kashmir and it oversees terrorist separatist groups in Kashmir. In 2019, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly discouraged Pakistani people from going to Kashmir to do Jihad. People who went to Kashmir will do an \\"injustice to the Kashmiri people\\". Most of the Pakistani militants who had crossed the border over the years and were caught by the Indian security forces were found to belong to the Punjab province of Pakistan. = Mujahideen influence = After the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, Mujahideen fighters, with the aid of Pakistan, slowly infiltrated Kashmir with the goal of spreading a radical Islamist ideology. = Religion = Jammu and Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in Hindu- majority India. Indian-American journalist Asra Nomani states that while India itself is a secular state, Muslims are politically, culturally and economically marginalised when compared to Hindus in India as a whole. The government's decision to transfer 99 acres of forest land in near Amarnath in the Kashmir valley to a Hindu organisation (for setting up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims) solidified this feeling and led to one of the largest protest rallies in Jammu and Kashmir. = Human rights abuses = After insurgency started in Kashmir valley because of above reasons in the late 1980s, Indian troops entered in Kashmir valley to control the insurgency. Some analysts have suggested that the number of Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir is close to 600,000 although estimates vary and the Indian government refuses to release official figures. The troops have been accused and held accountable for several humanitarian abuses and have engaged in mass extrajudicial killings, torture, rape and sexual abuse. Indian security forces have been implicated in many reports for enforced disappearances of thousands of Kashmiris whereas the security forces deny having their information and/or custody. This is often in association with torture or extrajudicial killing. Human right activists estimate the number of disappeared to be over eight thousand, last seen in government detention. The disappeared are believed to be dumped in thousands of mass graves across Kashmir.Buried Evidence: Unknown, Unmarked, and Mass Graves in Indian-Administered Kashmir A preliminary report; International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice in Kashmir A State Human Rights Commission inquiry in 2011, has confirmed there are thousands of bullet-ridden bodies buried in unmarked graves in Jammu and Kashmir. Of the 2730 bodies uncovered in 4 of the 14 districts, 574 bodies were identified as missing locals in contrast to the Indian governments insistence that all the graves belong to foreign militants. Military forces in Jammu and Kashmir operate under impunity and emergency powers granted to them by the central government. These powers allow the military to curtail civil liberties, creating further support for the insurgency. The insurgents have also abused human rights, driving Kashmiri Pandits away from the valley of Kashmir, an action regarded as ethnic cleansing The government's inability to protect the people from both its own troops and the insurgency has further eroded support for the government. Amnesty International accused security forces of exploiting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that enables them to \\"hold prisoners without trial\\". The group argues that the law, which allows security to detain individuals for as many as two years \\"without presenting charges, violating prisoners' human rights\\". The Army sources maintain that \\"any move to revoke AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir would be detrimental to the security of the Valley and would provide a boost to the terrorists.\\" Former Indian Army Chief General V. K. Singh rejected the accusations that the action was not taken in the cases of human rights violations by Army personnel. On 24 October 2010, he has said that 104 Army personnel had been punished in Jammu and Kashmir in this regard, including 39 officers. He also said that 95% of the allegations of human rights abuses against Indian Army were proved to be false, of which he remarked, had apparently been made with the \\"ulterior motive of maligning the armed forces\\". However, according to Human Rights Watch, the military courts in India, in general, were proved to be incompetent to deal with cases of serious human rights abuses and were responsible in covering up evidence and protecting the involved officers. Amnesty International in its report in 2015, titled \\"Denied\\"-Failures in Accountability in Jammu and Kashmir, says, \\"...with respect to investigations, an inquiry that is conducted by the same authority accused of the crime raises serious questions about the independence and impartiality of those proceedings\\", adding that according to the international law, an independent authority that is not involved in the alleged violations has to investigate such crimes. These human rights violations are said to have contributed to the rise of resistance in Kashmir. = Other reasons =  Psychological  Psychologist Waheeda Khan, explaining the rebellious nature of the Kashmiris, says that because of the tense situations in the valley from the 1990s, the generation gap between parents and young generations has increased. Young generations tend to blame their parents for failing to do anything about the political situation. So they start experimenting with their own aggressive ways to show their curbed feelings and would go against any authority. A prominent psychiatrist of the valley, Margoob, described that children/teenagers are much more vulnerable to passionate actions and reactions, since the young minds are yet to completely develop psychological mechanisms. When they assume that they are \\"pushed against the wall\\", they get controlled by the emotions without bothering about the consequences. Also young people easily identify themselves with the \\"group\\" rather than with their individual identities. It leads to psychological distress which causes antisocial behaviour and aggressive attitude. Often, this situation gets worsened by the availability of weapons and people becoming familiar to violence after having exposed to conflict for so long. Waheeda Khan remarks, the major concern is that generations of children who are experiencing long- term violence in their lives, may reach adulthood perceiving that violence is a fair means of solving ethinic, religious, or political differences. Economic High unemployment and lack of economic opportunities in Kashmir are also said to have intensified the struggle.  Stone pelting  Since the 2008 protests and 2010 unrest, the turmoil has taken a new dimension when people, particularly youngsters of the Kashmir valley have started pelting stones on security forces to express their aggression and protest for the loss of freedom. In turn they get attacked by the armed personnel with pellets, rubber bullets, sling shots and tear gas shells. This leads to eye- injuries and several other kind of injuries to many people. Security forces also face injuries, and sometimes get beaten up during these events. According to Waheeda Khan, most of the 'stone-pelters' are school and college going students. Large number of these people get arrested during these events for allegedly resorting to stone pelting, after which some of them are also tortured. According to political activist Mannan Bukhari, Kashmiris made stone, an easily accessible and defenseless weapon, their weapon of choice for protest. Kashmiri senior journalist Parvaiz Bukhari remarked: > The summer of 2010 witnessed a convulsion in the world‚Äôs most militarized > zone, the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, an unprecedented and deadly > civil unrest that is beginning to change a few things on the ground. [...] > Little known and relatively anonymous resistance activists emerged, > organizing an unarmed agitation more fierce than the armed rebellion against > Indian rule two decades earlier. And apparently aware of the post 9/11 > world, young Kashmiris, children of the conflict, made stones and rocks a > weapon of choice against government armed forces, side-stepping the tag of a > terrorist movement linked with Pakistan. The unrest represents a conscious > transition to an unarmed mass movement, one that poses a moral challenge to > New Delhi‚Äôs military domination over the region.  Human rights violations by militants and army  Further information: Human rights abuses by insurgents, Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir and Rape by militants Islamic separatist militants are accused of violence against the Kashmir populace. . On the other hand , Indian army has also committed serious crimes like using pellet guns, torture , killing and rape etc . The militants have kidnapped and killed many civil servants and suspected informers. Tens of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits have emigrated as a result of the violence. Estimates of the displaced varies from 170,000 to 700,000. Thousands of Kasmiri Pandits had to move to Jammu because of militancy.Alexander Evans, A departure from history: Kashmiri Pandits, 1990‚Äì2001, Contemporary South Asia (Volume 11, Number 1, 1 March 2002, pp. 19‚Äì37) = Notable attacks in J&K; = * July and August 1989 ‚Äì 3 CRPF personnel and politician Mohd.

Tactics  = India = Over time the Indian government has increasingly relied on military presence to control the insurgency. The military has allegedly committed human rights violations. The government would often dissolve assemblies, arrest elected politicians and impose president's rule. The government also rigged elections in 1987. In recent times there have been signs that the government is taking local elections more seriously. The government has also funneled development aid to Kashmir and Kashmir has now become the biggest per capita receiver of Federal aid. = Pakistan = The Pakistani central government originally supported, trained and armed the insurgency in Kashmir, sometimes known as \\"ultras\\" (extremists), however after groups linked to the Kashmiri insurgency twice attempted to assassinate president Pervez Musharraf, Musharraf decided to end support for such groups. His successor, Asif Ali Zardari has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir \\"terrorists\\". But the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence hasn't followed the lead of the government and has continued its support for insurgent groups in Kashmir In 2008, 541 people died due to insurgency, The Economist called it the lowest in two decades. The report cited a reduction in the support for militants by Pakistan and war fatigue among the Kashmiris as the reasons for the reduction in casualty figures. = Insurgents = Since around 2000 the 'insurgency' has become far less violent and has instead taken on the form of protests and marches. Certain groups have also chosen to lay down their arms and look for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. = Groups = The different insurgent groups have different aims in Kashmir. Some want complete independence from both India and Pakistan, others want unification with Pakistan and still others just want greater autonomy from the Indian government. A 2010 survey found that 43% of the people in J&K; and 44% of the people in AJK would favour complete independence from both India and Pakistan, with support for the independence movement unevenly distributed across the region.  Identity  Over the last two years, the militant group, Lashkar-e-Toiba has split into two factions: Al Mansurin and Al Nasirin. Another new group reported to have emerged is the \\"Save Kashmir Movement\\". Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (formerly known as Harkat-ul-Ansar) and Lashkar-e-Toiba are believed to be operating from Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir and Muridke, Pakistan respectively. Other less well known groups are the Freedom Force and Farzandan-e-Milat. A smaller group, Al- Badr, has been active in Kashmir for many years and is still believed to be functioning. All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an organisation that uses moderate means to press for the rights of the Kashmiris, is often considered as the mediator between New Delhi and insurgent groups. = Al-Qaeda = It is unclear if Al Qaeda has a presence in Jammu and Kashmir. Donald Rumsfeld suggested that they were active and in 2002 the SAS hunted for Osama bin Laden in Jammu and Kashmir. Al Qaeda claims that it has established a base in Jammu and Kashmir. However, there has been no evidence for any of these assertions. The Indian army also claims that there is no evidence of Al Qaeda presence in Jammu and Kashmir. Al Qaeda has established bases in Pakistani administered Kashmir and some, including Robert Gates have suggested that they have helped to plan attacks in India.  Casualties  According to Sumantra Bose in his book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, around 40000 (Indian estimates) to 80000 (Hurriyat estimates) civilians,Islamic Jihadi Terrorist s and Indian security personnel died from the time period of 1989 to 2002 in both Kashmir Valley and Jammu . More than 4600 security personnel, 13500 civilians and 15937 militants including 3000 from outside Jammu and Kashmir (mostly Pakistanis and some Afghans) were killed in this fourteen-year period. Also in this period, 55,538 incidents of violence were recorded. Indian forces engaged in counter insurgency operations captured around 40,000 firearms, 150,000 explosive devices, and over 6 million rounds of assorted ammunition. Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society posits a figure of 70,000 deaths, most of them civilians.

Biography Chow was a student in the USA, graduating from the University of Chicago in 1931. In 1932 he attended the University of G√∂ttingen, then transferred to the Leipzig University where he worked with van der Waerden. They produced a series of joint papers on intersection theory, introducing in particular the use of what are now generally called Chow coordinates (which were in some form familiar to Arthur Cayley). He married Margot Victor in 1936, and took a position at the National Central University in Nanjing. His mathematical work was seriously affected by the wartime situation in China. He taught at the National Tung-Chi University in Shanghai in the academic year 1946‚Äì47, and then went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he returned to his research. From 1948 to 1977 he was a professor at Johns Hopkins University. He was also a stamp collector, known for his book Shanghai Large Dragons, The First Issue of The Shanghai Local Post, published in 1996. Research According to Shiing-Shen Chern, \\"Wei-Liang was an original and versatile mathematician, although his major field was algebraic geometry. He made several fundamental contributions to mathematics: # A fundamental issue in algebraic geometry is intersection theory. The Chow ring has many advantages and is widely used. # The Chow associated forms give a description of the moduli space of the algebraic varieties in projective space. It gives a beautiful solution of an important problem. # His theorem that a compact analytic variety in a projective space is algebraic is justly famous. The theorem shows the close analogy between algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. # Generalizing a result of Caratheodory on thermodynamics, he formulated a theorem on accessibility of differential spaces. The theorem plays a fundamental role in control theory. # A lesser-known paper of his on homogeneous spaces gives a beautiful treatment of the geometry known as the projective geometry of matrices and treated by elaborate calculations. His discussions are valid in a more general context.\\" See also *Chow ring *Chow's theorem *Chow's moving lemma *Chow's lemma *Chow-Rashevskii theorem References External links  *Catalog listing for Shanghai Large Dragons, The First Issue of The Shanghai Local Post Category:1911 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Algebraic geometers Category:20th-century Chinese mathematicians Category:Educators from Shanghai Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Tongji University faculty Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Mathematicians from Shanghai ","title":"Wei-Liang Chow"},{"id":"1915246","text":"Habib Metropolitan Bank, commonly known as HabibMetro, is a Pakistani subsidiary of Swiss bank Habib Bank AG Zurich.

Sweet Valley High was the backbone of the collection, and was made into a popular television series. There were also several spin-offs, including The Unicorn Club and Sweet Valley University. Although most of these books were published in the 1980s and 1990s, they remained so popular that several titles have been re-released in recent years. Biography Francine Rubin was born in Manhattan, New York and raised in Queens, New York, United States. Her father was an auctioneer. In 1958, she graduated from New York University. It was there that she first met author and journalist John Pascal and, in 1965, they were married. Francine often credited John as her writing mentor, and they collaborated on several projects, including writing scripts for the ABC soap opera The Young Marrieds, which aired from 1964 to 1966 as part of the ABC Daytime block. John died of lung cancer in 1981, at 49 years of age. Francine's brother was the prolific Broadway playwright and librettist Michael Stewart, who wrote the books to such musical hits as Bye Bye Birdie and Hello, Dolly! Francine, her husband John, and her brother Michael worked together writing the book to the Broadway musical George M!, which ran at the Palace Theatre from 1968 to 1970. A television version of George M! was aired on NBC in 1970. Following her brother's death in 1987, Ms. Pascal revised his musical Mack & Mabel. She also worked on the revision of another of his musicals, Carnival!, for the Kennedy Center in Washington. Pascal's first young adult novel, published in 1977, was called Hangin' Out with Cici, in which her heroine, Victoria Martin, went back in time and met her mother as a teenager. It was televised as an ABC Afterschool Special, My Mother Was Never a Kid. She has written two other books about Victoria Martin; these were My First Love and Other Disasters and Love and Betrayal & Hold the Mayo. Another of her early novels, The Hand-Me-Down Kid, was also made into an ABC Afterschool Special. More recent works include the Caitlin series, a set of three trilogies which follows a teenage girl into adulthood, as well as a second mass-market project, the young adult fantasy spy series Fearless and its spin- off Fearless: FBI. A TV series was also planned for Fearless, but for several reasons it never aired. Another of Pascal's novels, The Ruling Class, a teen novel about a clique of spectacularly cruel girls who essentially run a high school in a wealthy Dallas suburb, has been described as \\"a magnetic tour de force created by a master storyteller at the top of her form.\\" In 1994, her Sweet Valley High book series was adapted for television with her brought aboard as \\"executive producer\\" and \\"creative consultant\\". None of her suggestions were really accepted and she has since disowned the show. In addition to her work for mostly female teens, Ms. Pascal has written some adult fiction books, including La Villa (originally published as If Wishes Were Horses) and Save Johanna!, as well as a non-fiction book, The Strange Case of Patty Hearst, on which she collaborated with her husband John. Sweet Valley Confidential: Ten Years Later revisited the Sweet Valley High characters ten years later, by which time they had become adults. The adult story continues with The Sweet Life, a series of e-books taking place three years after Sweet Valley Confidential. On February 22, 2008, Pascal's oldest daughter Jamie died after a two-year battle with liver disease. As of the last days of June 2015, Pascal was dividing her time between homes in New York and the south of France. She maintains a rigorous professional schedule, but spends as much time as she can with her children and grandchildren. Since John died, she has never remarried. Her daughter Susan now lives in Shanghai, with her daughter Nicole.  Awards  Ms. Pascal received The Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award, The Milner Award, The Bernard Versele Award, Brussels, and Publishers Weekly Literary Prize.

Biography She moved in 1951 from West to East Berlin with her stepfather, Karl Maron, the GDR Minister of the Interior. She studied theatre and spent time as a directing assistant and as a journalist. In the late 1970s, she began writing full-time in East Berlin. She left the GDR in 1988 with a three- year visa. After living in Hamburg, Germany, until 1992, she returned to a reunited Berlin, where she lives and writes. Her works deal to a large degree with confrontation with the past and explore the threats posed both by memory and isolation. Her prose is sparse, bleak, and lonely, conveying the sensitivity and desperation of her narrators. Her published work exhibeted increasingly conservative political views.

It stars Karen Black, Rainbow Harvest, Yvonne De Carlo and William Sanderson. The film follows a teenage outcast who finds herself drawn to an antique mirror left in the house she and her mother have moved into. A soundtrack for Mirror, Mirror was released in 1990 through Orphan Records. Plot In 1950s Iowa, Mary Weatherford sacrifices her sister Elizabeth in front of a large mirror, stabbing her to death on a bed. Decades later, Megan Gordon, a shy teenage goth, moves into the home from Los Angeles with her recently widowed mother, Susan. In her new bedroom, Megan finds the large mirror in the corner left behind by the previous owners. Emelin, the auctioneer in charge of the house clearance, finds a cache of journals that describe the mirror's apparent possession by a demonic force able to grant wishes. At her new school, Megan is taunted mercilessly by her peers, apart from the friendly Nikki as well as handsome, athletic Ron. Charleen, a bully running for class president against Nikki, quickly targets Megan. Meanwhile, as Megan becomes drawn to the mirror in her room, she's plagued by bizarre incidents at home; her mother's dog mysteriously dies, she's visited by a gruesome apparition of her dead father, and the mirror begins inexplicably dripping blood. Megan becomes convinced that the mirror is responsible for a series of misfortunes involving those around her, including Charleen experiencing a massive nosebleed in the cafeteria, and her teacher, Mr. Anderson, having a severe asthma attack during class. Realizing the mirror's powers, Megan begins harnessing them herself, using them to manipulate Jeff, Charleen's love interest, into developing a crush on her instead. When Jeff stops a sexual encounter, the demon in the mirror brutally murders him before making his body disappear. The next day, Emelin attempts to retrieve the mirror from the house while Megan and Susan are gone, but her hands are mysteriously impaled, leading her to flee. When Nikki loses the student council race to Charleen, Megan harnesses the mirror's powers to scald Charleen to death in the girls' locker room showers, before killing Charleen's friend Kim in a bathroom. Nikki becomes discomforted by Megan's change in personality, and is disturbed when Megan suggests she \\"helped\\" her usurp the class presidency. Nikki meets with Mrs. Perfili, the local real estate agent, and Emelin to inquire about the history of Megan's house and the mirror. Emelin reveals the content of the journals to Nikki, and explains that Mary Weatherford sacrificed her sister in front of the mirror decades ago hoping to appease it. After Nikki leaves, Emelin is impaled to death with a shard of glass at her antiques store. That night, Ron is attacked by a doppelg√§nger of Nikki in his house and brutally murdered. After finding Ron's body, Nikki receives a phone call from Megan asking her to come to her house. Meanwhile, Susan has her hand mangled in the garbage disposal in the kitchen and bleeds to death, leading Megan to turn against the mirror. Nikki arrives armed with a dagger and attempts to shatter the mirror, but it is resistant. She and Megan attempt to flee as a torrent of wind fills the house, but are unable to escape. Megan sacrifices herself to the mirror, thus ending its reign of terror. Nikki invokes the mirror, begging it to restore things back to how they were before. She awakens in the room on the bed, dagger in hand, with Megan's corpse beneath her, in the same position as Mary Weatherford, having been subjected to an apparent time loop. The demon shows itself in the mirror before retreating, and Nikki fearfully covers it with a sheet. Cast  Production  The film (initially titled The Black Glass) was shot in Los Angeles, and Zelda Rubenstein was originally slated to make an appearance in the film. The cast and crew were approximately sixty-percent female. The film's production company, Orphan Eyes, was based in Detroit, Michigan. Release Mirror, Mirror screened theatrically at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1990, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 31 that year, opening first in Detroit. It also screened at the Chicago International Film Festival on October 19, 1990. =Critical reception= Overall reception for the film has been mixed to positive, with Entertainment Weekly giving Mirror, Mirror a \\"B-\\" rating. In his book Generation Multiplex, Timothy Shary called Mirror, Mirror \\"one of the best teen horror films in general\\" and citing it as an example of \\"the tyranny of teen popularity.\\" Creature Features panned the film, giving it two stars and criticizing it as a \\"compendium of cliches.\\" Soundtrack A soundtrack for Mirror, Mirror was released on CD through Orphan Records in 1990. Jimmy Lifton composed and performed the movie's orchestral tracts, with the movie also featuring songs by Scott Campbell, Jim Walker, and Gene Evaro. =Track list= Home media The film was released on DVD on October 28, 2000 by Anchor Bay Entertainment. On March 6, 2004, it was re-released as part of a four-film set featuring the film's three sequels, called the \\"Mirror, Mirror Collection,\\" also by Anchor Bay. The set was packaged in a reflective foil case. Both releases are out of print. Sequels Mirror, Mirror was followed by three sequels, Mirror, Mirror II: Raven Dance (1994), Mirror, Mirror III: The Voyeur (1995), and Mirror, Mirror IV: Reflection (2000). Reception for the sequels was largely negative, with the Orlando Sentinel criticizing Raven Dance as \\"reflect[ing] poorly on [the] classic original\\". William Sanderson was the only actor from the first film to return for the second movie, albeit in a different role. The second film notably featured an early film appearance for Mark Ruffalo.

The buildings were limited to 150 feet by law, which was favored by architects and planners who saw the towering skyscrapers of the east coast metropolises as unsustainable and not conducive to the Southern California lifestyle.

MS-DOS and Macintosh computer ports were later released. A major selling point for the game was the \\"mature\\" content of the full motion video sequences, with a number of simulated sex scenes. The player takes on the role of a private investigator hired by a member of the wealthy Hawke family in order to gain enough evidence to bring down the corrupt Reed Hawke (played by Robert Culp), CEO of Hawke Industries. Hawke has gathered his family together for the weekend to prepare for his announcement that he will be running for President of the United States. The player controls a video camera located in a building opposite to spy on the Hawke family home in an effort to gather enough evidence to destroy Reed Hawke's career. The player character's client is randomly selected each time a new game is started, and the storyline also changes according to the player's actions. The design of Voyeur was inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock film ‚ÄúRear Window‚Äù starring Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. In the film, Jimmy Steward looks into the rear windows of a building across the interior courtyard from his apartment. He is able to see only some of what is going on in the apartments. He has to imagine the rest. He eventually thinks a murder has been committed in one of the apartments. In his effort to get evidence on the murderer he puts himself and Grace Kelly in mortal danger. This dramatic device was the basis for the design of Voyeur. The player can only see partial scenes playing in the windows of the Reed Hawke mansion at any point in time in the narrative. They must decide what is happening and what they want to do about it based on this partial information. The design also makes use of a ticking clock. Scenes appear in the windows of the Hawke mansion only for a brief period of time. If the player misses any of them or chooses to look at something else, their sense of what is going on could be incomplete. The player has the weekend to stop the nomination of Reed Hawke for president. If they guess wrong about which member of the family is betraying Hawke, the player is killed by an assassin. A sequel was released for PC and Macintosh entitled Voyeur II, and a finished beta version of the sequel for Philips CD-I has been discovered and distributed on various abandonware sites. Reception Reviewing the Macintosh version, a Next Generation critic remarked derisively on the limited interactivity of full motion video based games, but said that Voyeur is a superior game by the standards of its genre due to the solid acting. He gave it two out of five stars. Next Generation reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Although it won't appeal to action fans, this title has enough depth and replay value to be a valuable addition to any CD-i library.\\" References External links * *Voyeur at DefunctGames Category:1993 video games Category:CD-i games Category:DOS games Category:Erotic video games Category:Full motion video based games Category:Interactive movie video games Category:Mac OS games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Obscenity controversies in video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Voyeur (video game)"},{"id":"1915280","text":"Steven Lee \\"Buzz\\" Busby (born September 29, 1949) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Kansas City Royals. He batted and threw right-handed. Professional career A bright prospect, Busby won 56 games in his first three full seasons, only to have his career derailed by a rotator cuff tear. Drafted by the Royals in in the second round, the University of Southern California graduate made his debut the following season and stuck in the major leagues for good in , when he won 16 games and on April 27 pitched the first no-hitter in Kansas City Royals history, defeating the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium 3-0 on April 27. Busby became the first no-hit pitcher who did not come to bat during the entire game, with the American League having adopted the designated hitter rule that year. In a game against the California Angels on September 20, 1972, Busby hit a grand slam only to have it taken back by the first base umpire John Rice who said time out had been called to eject Jerry May. Nonetheless, Busby went on to hit a double and two singles in the game, while also earning the victory on the mound. In , Busby enjoyed his best season, winning 22 games and making the American League All-Star team. He also pitched a second no-hitter on June 19, this one against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium. Yielding only a second-inning walk to George Scott, Busby defeated the Brewers 2-0, besting Clyde Wright‚Äîhimself a no-hit pitcher in 1970. With this no-hitter, Busby became the first pitcher in major-league history to throw no-hitters in each of his first two complete seasons. In he won 18 games and made the All-Star team again. Busby had struggled with his control early in his career, but his problems returned to a greater degree in when he was diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff; an injury that at the time ended a pitcher's career. Busby subsequently became the first baseball player to undergo rotator cuff surgery. In an effort to help his arm recover from the surgery, his doctor recommended that Busby be placed on a pitch count. He is often believed to be the first baseball player to be placed on a pitch count, something that Busby has stated is a myth. Before his injury, he is alleged to have thrown close to 200 pitches in a game, which Busby also says is untrue. Unfortunately for Busby, the surgery did not save his career. After missing the entire season and most of , he pitched in 22 games (including 12 starts) the next year, compiling a respectable 6-6 record with a 3.63 ERA, but his walks outnumbered his strikeouts (64-to-45). In he even pitched a one-hitter, but otherwise pitched ineffectively, compiling a 6.17 ERA and allowing 80 baserunners in 42.1 innings. He pitched his final game on August 26 and the Royals released him three days later. Busby signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals before the season, but never pitched in the major leagues again. In an eight-year career, Busby posted a 70-54 record with 659 strikeouts and a 3.72 ERA in 1060.2 innings. Busby and outfielder Amos Otis were the first two players elected to the Royals Hall of Fame. In 2009, Busby was elected to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. His 70 career victories ranks him ninth on the Royals' all-time list. Broadcasting career Following the end of his playing career, Busby became a sportscaster, primarily for the Texas Rangers, and has also worked as an instructor at a baseball school. Unlike most former players, Busby acts as both a play-by-play man and a color commentator, and traded positions with Eric Nadel on radio broadcasts. After replacing Dave Barnett as television play-by-play announcer in the middle of the 2012 season, Busby had been working exclusively on play-by-play, with Tom Grieve on color. However, in October 2016, the Rangers announced that Busby would not be returning for the 2017 season. Dave Raymond has replaced Busby for the 2017 season.

Professional wrestling career Fernandez had success in 1979, becoming Florida Heavyweight Champion after a feud with Terry Funk. He also formed a tag team with Dusty Rhodes, and they won the NWA World tag team title from Ivan Koloff and Don Kernodle. They feuded with them and Ivan's \\"nephew\\" Nikita Koloff until losing the title to the Koloffs in early 1985. Fernandez soon became involved in a feud with Arn Anderson after being attacked by Anderson and laid out. He teamed with Thunderbolt Patterson to feud with Arn and Ole Anderson. In late 1985, he started helping Jimmy Valiant in his war against Paul Jones and his \\"Army\\". He formed a team with Valiant called the \\"B and B Connection\\" (\\"Boogie Woogie\\" and \\"Bull\\"). He had some matches against Abdullah the Butcher and The Barbarian. He also formed a tag team with Hector Guerrero in 1986 called The Latin Connection. In the summer of 1986, Fernandez accepted Jones' money and turned on Valiant starting a feud between the two. Later in the year, Jones also brought in Rick Rude. Pairing Fernandez and Rude together, the duo defeated The Rock 'n' Roll Express for the NWA World tag team title. They feuded with the Express and kept the titles until June 1987 when Rude left the promotion, which was resolved with a \\"phantom title change\\". Fernandez & Chavo Guerrero came to CWA in Memphis in 1987. Fernandez teamed with Ivan Koloff for the rest of the summer and left for the Mid-Southern promotion in late 1987. He was soon in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) feuding with Wahoo McDaniel after he attacked Wahoo and destroyed his headdress. The two veterans, who had feuded briefly in the NWA, engaged in an \\"Indian Strap match\\" at the AWA pay-per-view Super Clash III. After that feud ended in late 1988, Fernandez headed to Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council (WWC) where he stayed through 1991 and then he headed to the independent circuit. Fernandez sparked controversy in the WWC in 1989 when he wrestled Invader #3. During the match, Fernandez landed a knee drop off the top rope to Invader #3's midsection; the impact apparently ruptured Invader #3's stomach cavity, causing him to vomit blood all over the ring while Fernandez landed two more knee drops. There have been debates on whether Invader #3's injury was a work, with some theorizing that the incident came about due to real life bad blood between Fernandez and Jose Gonzalez, the booker of WWC who was acquitted of murdering Bruiser Brody earlier that year. Others say the blood was a combination of pig's blood and vodka. In an interview with Bill Apter, Fernandez claimed that it was not a work and deliberately injured Jose as a way to avenge the death of Bruiser Brody, though his match with Gonzalez took place nearly 2 months prior to Brody's death in July of the same year.

He is known for his work on the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect with Robert Hanbury Brown. It led to the development of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss intensity interferometer in the UK in 1954. Their work appeared to contradict the established beliefs about quantum interference, and he and Brown received the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for it in 1968. Life Richard Twiss was born in Simla in India but was educated in England. He read mathematics at Cambridge, completing the Mathematical Tripos with distinction, but his early contributions were to the theory of radar and basic electronics. His work in this area was included in the famous \\"five foot shelf\\"‚Äîa series of reference books in electronic engineering compiled at MIT that was the circuit designer's bible in the 1950s. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by MIT in 1949. Twiss went on to help construct the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. Observations with the interferometer began in 1965. Measurements made between 1965 and 1974 were used to establish the temperature scale for stars hotter than the Sun and this scale is still in use. The intensity interferometer has a very poor signal-to-noise ratio compared to the classical \\"Michelson\\" stellar interferometer. Twiss decided to pursue the Michelson alternative at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington in the UK. John Davis worked with him for a short while on this project. When the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh established its outstation at Monte Porzio Catone just south of Rome, Twiss decided to move his Michelson interferometer there. Not only was the weather more conducive to astronomy, the food and wine were much superior to what was available in Teddington! Speckle interferometry was discovered during that period by Antoine Labeyrie. This stimulated a renewed interest around the world in interferometry. In particular, John Davis and Hanbury Brown became convinced that a Michelson interferometer would be cheaper to build and have superior performance to a new intensity interferometer. In the mid-1970s Twiss's non-scientific interests gradually took over and he effectively retired from active involvement in science. In the 1970s he made it clear that he regarded Australia as a colonial backwater. His reaction when told that William J. Tango was going to join Davis and Brown in Sydney was typical. \\"But William,\\" he said, \\"they eat peas out of tins!\\" In spite of that, a few years before his death Twiss visited Australia and fell in love with it. In 2004 he applied for permanent residence. He died on 20 May 2005. He is mentioned in the book \\"Boffin : A Personal Story of the Early Days of Radar, Radio Astronomy and Quantum Optics\\" , by Hanbury Brown He was awarded the Albert A. Michelson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1982, jointly with Robert Hanbury Brown.
