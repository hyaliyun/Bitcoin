Crafted in either 15th or 16th century Sierra Lione, the item is on view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 352.  Background  Ivory carving was a traditional part of West African art. In what is now Sierra Leone, the Supi people were noted for producing ivory pieces for export. When Portuguese traders began to establish themselves in enclaves on the ivory and grain coasts in the late 15th century, they began to commission local artisans to produce intricately-designed ivory vessels, receptacles, and boxes for export to Europe. Given the valuable nature of ivory, these containers were typically only used to hold valuable goods, such as salt, pepper, and other spices, all of which the nascent Portuguese Empire was quickly gaining access to through its widening trade network. The result of these trade relations was a mixing of Portuguese and Supi artistic tradition, creating an Afro-Portuguese style of art. This hybridization resulted in works of art that contained symbols, motifs, and imagery derived from both the Supi and the Portuguese.Vogel, Susan M. For Spirits and Kings: African Art from the Paul and Ruth Tishman Collection. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1981.  Description  The lidded saltceller dates to either the late 15th century or the 16th century. The work is made from carved ivory and bone, and was used to hold salt. Three snakes, a symbol of wealth among the Supi, decorate the container, while four snarling dogs are seen to be confronting the snakes. Notably, the dogs (themselves a symbol of the spiritual world to the Supi) are depicted in a European style similar to medieval hunting manuscripts, indicating a crossing of artistic traditions.

From 1877‚Äì1881, when female woodwind and brass players were rare, Linden performed throughout the eastern United States as a soloist in regional theatrical circuits, female minstrelsy, and vaudeville.  Early life  Louise Linden was born Louise Pott on 10 September 1862 in New York City to musician Henry Pott and his wife Marie Pollfogt, who were German immigrants. Before she was fourteen, Linden moved from Brooklyn, New York, to Portland, Maine, to live with her sister Armena (b. 1852) and to study saxophone with her brother-in-law Fred ter Linden (1839-1891). Fred ter Linden was musical director of Portland's Orpheus Symphony Club, whose ‚Äúmembership was composed of amateurs in instrumental music.‚Äù Linden's first public performance occurred on 6 October 1876 at a musicale given by ter Linden's pupils. On 6 December 1876 she played a saxophone solo on a lyceum program at the Portland City Hall. A review that appeared in the Boston Traveller proclaimed, > And now we have something new in the way of instrumental music. Miss Louise > Linden has succeeded in mastering the saxophone, and has accomplished what > no other lady has ever attempted. She executed a solo in the most artistic > manner, producing the softest and sweetest tones, to the astonishment of all > present. This was her first public appearance and was an entire success. In the spring of 1877, Linden's friends from Brooklyn ‚Äúpresented her with a magnificent gold saxophone‚Äù in appreciation of her talent and skill.  Professional career  = Swedish Lady Quartet = Linden made her professional debut on 7 September 1877 in Reading, Pennsylvania, as part of a benefit concert for John D. Mishler, manager of the Swedish Lady Vocal Quartet. Fred ter Linden accompanied Linden on piano. Mishler then hired them to join the Swedish Lady Quartet on a five-week tour of central and western Pennsylvania and upstate New York. During the remainder of the 1877-78 season, Linden played a series of concerts and benefit performances in the New York City area at venues such as Cooper Institute, Chickering Hall, Poole and Donnelly's Grand Opera House, and Steinway Hall.Smialek & Logrande, p. 4. = Fenderson-Bent Company = In May 1878 Linden met Gilmore Band cornet soloist Benjamin C. Bent (1847‚Äì1898), and soon the two became romantically involved. Although she was not yet sixteen, Linden ran away with the thirty-year-old cornetist that July Fourth. The two were married in Newport, Rhode Island, on July 18 upon hearing that Linden's father had tracked them down and intended to bring her back home. That fall, she joined the Fenderson-Bent Company for its tour of upstate New York and Ohio. Bent created the ensemble with soprano Juliet Fenderson to provide work while he was on sabbatical from the Gilmore Band during its European tour. In addition to their respective solos, the Company's programs featured saxophone and cornet duets by Linden and Bent, which received praise from reviewers and audiences alike. Although the company received enthusiastic reviews throughout the tour, its performances were poorly attended. By mid-November, the Fenderson-Bent Company disbanded due to ‚Äúpoor patronage‚Äù of its performances. Bent freelanced in New York City during the spring of 1879. In January 1879, Linden was engaged to play a series of concerts at the Bellevue House, one of four hilltop resorts that overlooked Cincinnati from a high bluff above. She performed weekend matinees and evenings accompanied by the German Military Band. Linden finished the month of February in Cincinnati at the Atlantic Garden, performing a series of ‚ÄúGrand Concerts‚Äù with Andy Brand's Full Orchestra. Throughout the summer of 1879, Linden appeared as soloist with Arthur Bent's Marine Band aboard the steamer Plymouth Rock during its daily excursion cruises to Rockaway Beach, located on the South Shore of Long Island in Queens, New York. = Madame Rentz‚Äôs Female Minstrels = Linden continued to perform independently from Bent, who had resumed his position in Gilmore's Band. In 1879-1880, she toured with Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels, beginning in upstate New York, then on to Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, and back to New York. This venture marked a considerable departure from the settings in which Linden had formerly been presented. Michael B. Leavitt (1843‚Äì1935), an American theater entrepreneur, manager, and producer, named the company after a European tent show called Rentz's Circus. In the early 1870s, ‚ÄúLeavitt conceived the idea of merging the lady minstrel show, vaudeville, and musicalized travesty into one production which he called burlesque.‚Äù Leavitt's hybrid burlesque form retained the three-part structure of the minstrel show, though with an expanded and more varied olio (second part). Linden performed a virtuosic solo in the variety segment, encored by renditions of popular songs and ballads, and otherwise played in a seven-piece orchestra that accompanied the onstage performers. The afterpiece, a burlesque entitled ‚ÄúThe Teutonic Tug Tub Pinafore,‚Äù satirized Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta H.M.S. Pinafore, which enjoyed immense popularity in America that year.Smialek & Logrande, p. 8. Leavitt actually managed two burlesque companies with similar names. The Rentz-Santley Novelty Company, named after early burlesque star Mabel Santley, clearly embodied burlesque's pronounced emphasis on the female form over minstrelsy's racial or ethnic humor. Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels, however, retained the interlocutor and end men of the traditional minstrel show joined by an ensemble of ‚Äúblondes,‚Äù but without the overt displays of sexuality, which occasionally caused misplaced expectations among its patrons. An engagement in Ithaca, New York, by Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels deteriorated into a full-blown riot after Cornell students disrupted the show because they became bored with its tameness. = M. B. Leavitt‚Äôs Gigantic Vaudeville and Specialty Company = M. B. Leavitt claimed, ‚Äúduring the season of 1880 I used the term ‚ÄòVaudeville‚Äô for the Ô¨Årst time in connection with a variety entertainment in America.‚Äù Leavitt‚Äôs new Gigantic Vaudeville and Specialty Company featured a diverse combination of variety acts‚Äîsuch as gymnasts, acrobats, rope skippers, comedians, operatic singers, sketch actors, and musicians‚Äî‚Äústrung together to produce a compete bill of entertainment.‚Äù In unambiguous contrast to the female burlesque performers of The Rentz-Santley Novelty Company, Linden‚Äôs publicity poster from Leavitt‚Äôs Gigantic Vaudeville and Specialty Company presents her ‚Äúin a manner befitting a respectable artist. She wears a fashionable corseted dress with a bustle and long train, a cameo necklace, and a ribbon in her elaborately coiffed hair. She holds her alto saxophone at an angle that complements her dignified pose. The image of refinement projected visually by Linden‚Äôs poster corresponds to the sophistication that her musical performances would provide to the company‚Äôs bill in balancing the more entertainment-oriented acts.‚ÄùSmialek & Logrande, p. 11. After an opening week in Brooklyn, New York, at the end of August, 1880, Leavitt's ‚ÄúGigantics‚Äù embarked on an eight-month tour of major cities throughout the East and Midwest, including Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, numerous small towns in Wisconsin and Iowa, Kansas City, St. Louis, more small cities and towns in Indiana and Ohio, Cleveland, then finishing the year in the Northeast. In 1881, the company made repeat visits to many of its fall destinations; after a week in Chicago at the end of February, the route turned eastward, with a season- ending week in New York City at the end of April. These bookings typically featured week-long engagements in the larger cities‚Äô prominent theaters. In between its visits to larger cities, the company would be booked in a series of one-night stands in smaller towns within a single region (such as Iowa or Pennsylvania), or in medium-sized cities in the direction of the next big-city destination. In such a large company, Linden did not stand out the way she had with the Swedish Lady Quartet or Fenderson-Bent concert parties. The acrobatic Garretta family typically received the greatest attention, but Linden earned numerous positive, albeit brief, mentions in the troupe's reviews. During the season's opening week in Brooklyn, ‚ÄúMiss Louise Linden, the only lady saxophone artiste in the world, astonished and delighted her audience by the unexpected excellence of her playing.‚Äù After her success in Chicago, she was called ‚Äúa charming saxophone soloist‚Äù in St. Louis. A reviewer in Indianapolis wrote, ‚ÄúMiss Louise Linden is certainly great on the saxophone; it is a very difficult instrument to play upon, but she seems to have mastered it.‚Äù In cities where Linden had performed prior to her time in vaudeville, reviews and audience response were especially positive. In Cincinnati, she was described as ‚Äúa little German band in herself,‚Äù giving ‚Äúselections artistically performed on the saxophone.‚Äù A review in Buffalo, New York, proclaimed, ‚ÄúMiss Louise Linden is known as an accomplished saxophone soloist. Her solo was deservedly encored.‚Äù She was recalled for encores in Rochester, as well. In the closing week of the season, at New York City's San Francisco Opera House, ‚ÄúMlle. Louise Linden displayed her dexterity in playing the saxophone. . . . The house was full and the audience manifested its enjoyment frequently and decidedly.‚Äù = After Leavitt = After the 1880‚Äì1881 season, Linden took a fifteen-year hiatus from performing as she was raising children. (Benjamin Bent, Jr. was born in 1883. According to the 1900 US Census, she had had two other children who died before adulthood.) By the mid-1890s Louise Linden Bent became musically active again. On 8‚Äì9 February 1896, she was a featured soloist with Innes‚Äô Band at the Montauk Theater in Brooklyn, receiving encores for her performance of Paganini's Air Varie. That November, Linden Bent returned to vaudeville, appearing for a week on the bill at Proctor's Pleasure Palace in New York City. Her selections received numerous encores. During the 1896‚Äì97 season, she had a successful run at Hammerstein's Olympia. On 7 February 1897, she participated in a benefit concert for the Treasurer's Club of America at the Broadway Theater in New York. Her final documented performance occurred on 27 March 1898, when she and Benjamin Bent appeared on a benefit performance for philanthropist Henriette Markstein at the American Theater in New York. After Benjamin Bent's death on 30 December 1898, Louise Linden Bent moved from Harlem to the Bronx. She was no longer musically active and likely lived for a time on the income from her husband's investments and estate.Smialek & Logrande, p. 13. By 1920 Linden Bent worked as a matron for the telephone company, overseeing young female operators. She was subsequently employed as a matron by Edison Company. Louise Linden Bent died on 22 August 1934 after an eight-month bout of breast cancer.  Repertoire  Linden's performing repertoire featured both virtuosic and expressive compositions. (As few original concertos for saxophone existed at that time, performers such as Edward A. Lefebre (1834-1911) often soloed using the theme and variations format.) On 13 January 1878, Linden performed ‚ÄúVariations di Concert‚Äù by Paganini at the Grand Opera House in New York City. (In 1876, before she turned professional, Linden likely performed the same solo under slightly different titles: Variation de Concerto and Variationi di Concerto.Smialek & Logrande, p. 3.) Whether this composition was an arrangement of a piece by Paganini, or a set of variations on one of his musical themes, it likely showcased Linden's technical virtuosity on the saxophone. She also played variations on the famous Carnival of Venice.Smialek & Logrande, p. 12. Popular melodies, such as Stephen C. Foster's ‚ÄúOld Folks at Home,‚Äù Henry Bishop and John Howard Payne's ‚ÄúHome, Sweet Home,‚Äù S. Filmore Bennet and Joseph P. Webster's ‚ÄúIn the Sweet By-and-By,‚Äù and ‚ÄúComing Through the Rye,‚Äù were given as encores or to display her lyricism.  Critical reception  Critical reviews of Linden's performances ‚Äúacknowledged the virtuosity that Linden typically exhibited onstage . . . consistently [reporting] enthusiastic audience reaction and routine calls for encores.‚ÄùSmialek & Logrande, p. 15. When she was sixteen, the Buffalo Courier favorably compared Linden to Lefebre‚Äîthe pre-eminent saxophone soloist of the time and twenty-five years her senior‚Äîfinding her playing to have ‚Äúall the masculine strength of the soloist who is such a favorite in Gilmore‚Äôs Band, but her tonguing is better, and in delicacy and in correctness of expression she is his superior.‚Äù Another review in the Courier praised her technique and breath control: > Miss Louise Linden, the remarkable performer upon the saxophone . . . is > said to be superior as any performer in the country. Her powers of execution > are marvellous and she can play a long and difficult passage, that > ordinarily requires from two to three inspirations, without removing the > instrument from her lips or taking breath. Due to the rarity of female wind players and the newness of the saxophone, both Linden and her instrument were promoted‚Äîand responded to‚Äîas novelties. Reviewers often attempted to describe the sound of the saxophone to readers who presumably had never heard the instrument: > The most pleasing part of the programme at this resort during the past week > was the Saxophone solos by Miss Louise Linden. This instrument is but little > known, but in the hands of such an artist is capable of some most charming > effects. Its tones are a mixture of clarionette, saxhorn and bassoon, > susceptible of great modulations and flexibility of sound, and resembling > somewhat the human voice. Cornetist Anna Theresa Berger (1853‚Äì1925) was actually Linden's closest peer as a musician. Each equaled prominent male soloists on her respective instrument in both technique and expression. Although Linden and Berger both received exceedingly positive reviews, these were often tempered by disclaimers taking into account their gender.Smialek & Logrande, p. 17. Linden's 1881 performance of The Carnival of Venice at the Summer-Garden Concerts at the Academy of Music in Baltimore, created > much interest by her superior execution on the instrument. She played in > response ‚ÄúOld Folks at Home‚Äù very sweetly. Later in the evening she played > ‚ÄúHome, Sweet Home.‚Äù The audience were entertained not only with the music > but with the novelty. It is an exceptional thing for men to play solos on > the saxophone, let alone a woman.‚Äù A reviewer from the Rochester, New York, Union & Advertiser pronounced astonishment that a woman could display such capability on a wind instrument: > By far the most remarkable performance of the evening, however, was Miss > Louise Linden‚Äôs playing upon the saxophone. This instrument, a comparatively > modern invention, requires not only great endurance in a player, but also > the utmost facility of manipulation. These difficulties were most > brilliantly surmounted by the young lady. It must have required no slight > amount of courage for a woman to undertake so unusual a task as the learning > of a wind instrument, and no slight amount of perseverance to overcome the > many obstacles that such a task would naturally present. The artistic finish > with which Miss Linden acquitted herself last night merits unstinted praise > and admiration.

Prior to this, she served as Minister for Territorial Policy and Civil Service of the Government of Spain between June 2018 and May 2019. A professor of Constitutional Law at the Pompeu Fabra University, she has been a member of the Socialist Parliamentary Group in the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th terms of the lower house.  Early years and academic career  Batet studied at the Gravi School in Barcelona and joined the university with the support of scholarships. In 1995 she graduated in Law from the Pompeu Fabra University where also took doctorate courses with the presentation of the thesis Participation, deliberation and transparency in the institutions and bodies of the European Union. In 1998 she completed a postgraduate course in real estate and urban development law at IDEC. In 2013 presented the doctoral thesis project entitled The principle of subsidiarity in Spain. From 1995 to 1998 she was professor of Administrative Law at Pompeu Fabra University and was a professor of Constitutional Law until her appointment as Minister in 2018. In 2007 received a German Marshall scholarship to maintain a stay in the United States.  Member of the Congress of Deputies  Her first contact with politics was during her student years. She explained in different interviews that when she received a grant from the Generalitat to study the doctorate at the university, her thesis supervisor, Josep Mir, told her that Narc√≠s Serra, then first secretary of the PSC, was looking for someone to coordinate his secretariat who was not a militant. Batet collaborated with him for two years. From 2001 to 2004 she directed the Carles Pi i Sunyer Foundation for Autonomous and Local Studies. In 2004, she was an independent in the ninth position on the Barcelona list of the Socialist Party of Catalonia for the Congress of Deputies headed by Jos√© Montilla and was elected member of parliament for Barcelona. In 2008 she joined the PSC where she works in the group of Gr√†cia of the Federation of Barcelona. In the legislative elections of 2008 occupied the eleventh position of the list for Barcelona and renewed her seat as in the legislative elections of 2011 to which it concurred in the position number eight. In February 2013 she broke the voting discipline of the Socialist Group together with other members of the PSC by voting in the Congress of Deputies in favor of the two initiatives presented by CiU and La Izquierda Plural (IU-ICV / EUiA-CHA) to allow the carrying out a referendum in Catalonia on its future relationship with the rest of Spain. The socialist group fined undisciplined deputies with 600 euros. In July 2014, she was appointed Secretary of Studies and Programs in the Federal Executive Commission of the PSOE, assuming her first organic position. In the legislative elections of 2015, she was number two on the PSOE list for Madrid despite being a PSC militant in tandem with Secretary-General Pedro S√°nchez. In addition to coordinating the electoral program for the elections, S√°nchez entrusted her with the coordination of the team of experts that outlines its proposal for reforming the Constitution. In February 2016, she was one of the people chosen by S√°nchez to negotiate with other political forces in an attempt to set up an alternative government alliance to PP. In April 2016, she agreed to head the PSC's list for Barcelona in the general election convened for the month of June, following the resignation of Carme Chac√≥n to become a candidate again. In May 2016, it was confirmed that Batet would be a candidate without primaries after the resignation of Carles Mart√≠ to propose an alternative candidacy:  Minister for Territorial Policy and Civil Service  In June 2018, following the motion of censure that the PSOE presented against the previous government of Mariano Rajoy (PP) and that was approved by the Congress of Deputies on June 1, new Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro S√°nchez, appointed her as Minister in new Spanish government. Felipe VI formally appointed her by royal decree on June 6 as holder of the portfolio of Minister for Territorial Policy and Civil Service. On 7 June she took office as Minister before the King at Palace of Zarzuela. At the request of the Prime Minister and to focus solely on government work, Batet resigned to her seat in parliament after more than 14 years of service on June 15. She stepped down on May 20, 2019 in order to become head of the Congress of Deputies.https://boe.es/boe/dias/2019/05/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2019-7534.pdf  Speaker of the Congress of Deputies  Batet was elected Member of the Congress of Deputies again in the April 2019 general election. On May 17, 2019, the Socialist Party, winner of the general election, announced that would present Batet as the candidate of the party to be the next speaker of the lower house. The Cortes Generales opening sessions were held on May 21 and, as expected, Batet was elected Speaker. Batet was elected thanks to the support of her party, the far-left Unidas Podemos and other minority parties such us Basque Nationalist Party, Comprom√≠s, Canarian Coalition and the Regionalist Party of Cantabria. The 13th Cortes Generales were disbanded on September 24, 2019 due to the impossibility of forming a government. Batet was re-elected on the November 2019 general election and the Socialist Party presented her as its candidate to Speaker of the House.

It is located within Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula. Mount Mystery is the sixth-highest peak of the Olympic Mountains, after Mount Olympus, Mount Deception, Mount Constance, Mount Johnson, and Inner Constance. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Deception, to the north-northwest. Little Mystery (6941 ft) is a subsidiary summit south of Mount Mystery. Mount Mystery is located in the eastern portion of the Olympic Mountains just south of Mount Deception at the headwaters of Deception Creek. This location puts it in the rain shadow of the Olympic Range, resulting in far less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. Mount Mystery sits on the boundary between the drainage basins of the Dungeness River, to the north, and the Dosewallips River to the east. Deception Creek, a tributary of the Dosewallips River, drains the east and west slopes of Mount Mystery, including a small melting glacier on the east side referred to colloquially as Mystery Glacier. Mount Mystery was given its name circa 1915 by G.A. Whitehead of the U.S. Forest Service because he admired its regal appearance in foggy weather. Climate Mystery from Deception Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Mystery is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing this mountain. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. Recreation While not a particularly technical climb, Mount Mystery is steep and exposed. If a climber falls and does not arrest immediately, loose rock and rotten snow may make it difficult to stop falling for some distance. The nearby Needles are typically regarded as providing better, and somewhat more difficult, mountaineering objectives in the Royal Basin area.

ATTA is used on long-lived, stable radioisotopes such as , , and . By using a laser that is locked to an atomic transition, a CCD or PMT will detect the laser induced fluorescence to allow highly selective, parts-per-trillion to parts-per-quadrillion concentration measurement with single atom detection. This method is useful for atomic transport processes, such as in the atmosphere, geological dating, as well as noble gas purification. ATTA measurements are possible only if the atoms are excited to a metastable state prior to detection. The main difficulty to accomplishing this is the large energy gap (10-20 eV) between the ground and excited state. The current solution is to use an RF discharge, which is a brute force technique that is inefficient and leads to complications such contamination of the walls from ion sputtering and high gas density. A new scheme for generating a metastable beam which can achieve a cleaner, slower, and preferably more intense source would provide a substantial advance to ATTA technology. All-optical techniques have been considered, but have not yet been able to compete with the discharge source. A new technique for generation of metastable krypton involves the use of a two photon transition driven by a pulsed, far-UV laser to populate the excited state which decays to the metastable state with high probability.

The Cheyenne and Arapaho were hostile to the settlers, who make their houses to be like fortresses‚Äìmake of stone and wooden walls as much as three-feet-thick. Some had narrow slots just wide enough to use to shoot a rifle from inside the house. Families would huddle together during uprisings. In 1868, there were raids by Native Americans, who stole 150 horses from Harlow Teachout, and two young boys were killed in another raid. Railroad station and early village years The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad was constructed east of Monument Creek and a railroad post office was opened in 1870 at Edgerton. In 1872, David Edgerton homesteaded 160 acres and established a ranch. The village grew around his ranch and was called Edgerton after him. In 1881, a post office and the VC Lewis Hotel were established. Village growth Residents were engaged in the lumber industry. Academy School District 20 was organized in 1886 by residents of Douglass, Pine, and Woodmen Valleys over a 36-square-mile area in 1874. (Pine and Douglass Valleys are immediately northwest of the Edgerton town site. Students from Woodmen Valley rode horses to school.) Classes were held in houses until 1886 when the Edgerton School opened near the railroad stop for Edgerton. Located on a mesa above the mouth of West Monument Creek, it was the first schoolhouse for the district. It generally taught grades one through six, but sometimes up to grade eight. Two lakes, one of which was called Ice Lake, were built by five pioneers in the mid-1880s. Their business was the Cascade Ice Company. During the winter they harvested blocks of ice from the lakes and sold the ice to keep food cool before there was refrigeration. The ice was loaded onto insulated railroad cars to be transported for sale elsewhere. There are ruins of the dams used to create the lakes, but there is no evidence of the original \\"ice lakes\\". The town also had a general store. The town's residents were upset after the Kearney Ranch murders of Mrs. Kearney and her six-year-old grandson, James Hand in 1886. Their bodies were found after they had been brutally murdered and signs that a meal that was about to be served. There were three place settings, but the identity of the additional person was not known, but believed to be the murderer and someone known to the family. There were 50 residents of the settlement in 1890 and 350 people living there by 1902. Many of the residents suffered from tuberculosis, and they came to the area seeking treatment. Transition The hotel closed when the new and faster means of transportation meant few customers. It became a farm and ranch house, and then the property was leased as pasture land, and the building burned down in 1941. The railroad post office closed in 1902 and it was moved to Pikeview. The Edgerton School closed in 1915 with the opening of the Woodmen Valley School, which was the only school in the district until 1957. When the highway, now Interstate 25, was built in the 1920s, there were even fewer visitors and it eventually ceased to exist as a village. The school site is now part of the Air Force Academy near the South Gate. It is along the Santa Fe Regional Trail that connects to the Pikes Peak Greenway at the Ice Lake trailhead.

It is one of the oldest surviving European pistols. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  The pistol was made by gunsmith Peter Peck of Munich for Emperor Charles V, a noted firearms enthusiast.Donald La Rocha, Curator, Metropolitan Museum of ArtTroso, Mario. Italia! Italia! 1526‚Äì1530: La Prima Guerra D'indipendenza Italiana: Con Gli Assedi Di Milano, Napoli, Firenze, Il Sacco Di Roma E Le Battaglie Di Capo D'orso E Gavinana. Parma: E. Albertelli, 2001. pp. 256‚Äì57, pl. T25. The .46 caliber double-barreled pistol fires via the use of two wheellock mechanisms, one for each barrel; these were commonly used in custom- made firearms of the day, as while wheellocks were more expensive they were considered more reliable than early flintlock mechanisms or matchlocks.Blair, Claude. Pistols of the World. London: Batsford, 1968. p. 113, pl. 394. The pistol's wheellocks are noted as being particularly precise, as Peck worked as a watchmaker in addition to being a gunsmith. While it was mused that Charles commissioned a pistol with two barrels and two wheellocks as befitting his status as the sovereign of two empires (Charles V was emperor of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire), similarly-dated firearms from Bavaria also employ a double wheellock firing action.Dean, Bashford, and Robert T. Nichol. Handbook of Arms and Armor, European and Oriental. 4th ed. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1930. p. 178 In terms of aesthetics, the 5 lb. 10 oz pistol is elaborately decorated; the pistol's cherry wood stock is inlaid with ivory and staghorn, its metalwork is engraved and sheaved in gold, while the gun's grip is intricately carved. The bodywork of the gun is stamped with a double headed eagle (Charles' symbol as Holy Roman Emperor) and an image of the Pillars of Hercules, a symbol of the Crown of Spain. The weapon is inscribed with the Latin motto Plus ultra (More beyond), which is the national motto of the Kingdom of Spain.Pyhrr, Stuart W. \\"Of Arms and Men: Arms and Armor at the Metropolitan, 1912‚Äì2012.\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin (Summer 2012), p. 17, fig. 22. On the reverse side from the two wheellocks, the ivory inlay of the gun has been carved away to form a relief image of hunters and hunting dogs chasing game. The gun's decoration was executed by German gunsmith Ambrosius Gemlich.

The route starts at Eastside Lake Washington Road near Glen Allan and travels eastward. The road intersects MS 1 in Hampton and turns northeastward. It ends near Percy at U.S. Route 61 (US 61). MS 436 was designated in 1957, along a road from US 61 to a point near the Washington‚ÄìSharkey county line. The route was extended westward to Glen Allan along a state-maintained road in 1958, and also eastward to Belzoni via a county road in 1967. The route east of US 61 was decommissioned by 1967. Route description All of the route is located in Washington County. MS 436 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 436 starts at Eastside Lake Washington Road, near the eastern shore of Lake Washington and the unincorporated area of Glen Allan. The route travels eastward through farmland to MS 1 in Hampton, and it crosses Steele Bayou afterwards. The road turns northeastwards at Grace Road and borders the Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge. The road travels along Steele Bayou and it intersects the entrance to the refuge at Beargarden Road. At Woodsaw Mill Road, MS 436 turns east and away from the refuge. Past the second intersection with Beargarden Road, the road shifts south towards the Washinghton‚ÄìSharkey county line. The route travels on the county line, ending at US 61 at a three-way junction near Percy. History Around 1933, a gravel road was constructed from MS 1 near Glen Allan to US 61 near the Washington‚ÄìSharkey county line, and it was later paved by 1948. The section from Glen Allan to Hampton also became part of MS 1. MS 1 was realigned in 1952, no longer routing through Glen Allen. By 1957, a new paved road was constructed from US 61 near Hollandale to a point near the Washington‚ÄìHumphreys county line, and it was designated as MS 436. About one year later, MS 436 was extended westward to Glen Allan, connecting to MS 1. A county-maintained county road in Humphreys County was added to the route by 1960, connecting the route to US 49W near Belzoni. By 1967, the section east of US 61 was removed from the route, and the route has not changed significantly since.

It was designed by George William Welch and built in 1924. It is also known as Country Womens Association hall and Country Women's Association meeting rooms. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011.  History  =Township history= The first inhabitants of the Narrandera district were the Wiradjuri Aboriginal people. Many Aboriginal families were forced into missions in the late 19th century and then affected by the twentieth century \\"Stolen Generation\\" practice of removing Aboriginal children from the care of their parents. Nonetheless in the 21st century many Aboriginal people continue to inhabit the area in a variety of more and less traditional lifestyles. The first known European to pass through the Narrandera district was the explorer, Charles Sturt, who camped beside the Murrumbidgee River in 1829. Settlers quickly followed to farm the good land around the Murrumbidgee, although travel by bullock this far inland was costly and unreliable. In the 1850s many gold diggers visited on their way to the Victorian gold fields. 1858 saw paddle steamers being introduced to the Murrumbidgee River as a means of transport. In 1860 the village of Narrandera was proclaimed and the train line there connected in 1881, leading to expansion of the village. In 1885 the local government area of Narrandera was proclaimed. In 1906 irrigation canals were constructed from the Murrumbidgee to water the drier areas of Leeton, Griffith and Coleambally resulting in the land being used for more intensive farming of produce such as rice and citrus fruits. In 1960 Yanko Shire and Narrandera Municipal Council were amalgamated into Narrandera Shire Council.(Narrandera Council webpage - History) The township of Barellan lies on the northern edge of the Riverina. Along with Grong Grong it is one of two main villages in the Narrandera Shire. The township was proclaimed in 1909, a year after it was linked by rail to Temora (and Sydney). After the advent of the railway the Barellan area transformed from vast grazing holdings into a more densely populated pattern of grain paddocks, mixed farms, saw milling centres and commercial centres.(O'Keefe & Semmler) The international Aboriginal tennis champion Evonne Goolagong (now Evonne Cawley) grew up in Barellan, where she began playing tennis. Other prominent residents of Narrandera Shire are the novelist Thomas Alexander Browne and poet John O'Brien. Another prominent former resident of Narrandera is Marie Bashir, the New South Wales Governor, who grew up there. =History of the CWA= The Country Women's Association (CWA) of New South Wales, the first such group in Australia, was founded at a Bushwomen's Conference held in conjunction with the Royal Agricultural Show in Sydney in 1922. It began and has remained a non-sectarian, non-party-political, non-profit lobby group and service association working in the interests of women and children in rural areas. Although in practice the group has tended to bolster conservative politics, historically it has also been a progressive force in many ways. While it has defended traditional gender roles, it has also advocated a greater public role for country women. As early as 1936 the NSW branch passed a resolution in favour of equal pay for women. Although its influence has declined in recent years the CWA with its large membership and longevity was arguably the most influential twentieth century women's organisation in New South Wales.Australian Women's Register summarising Townsend, 1988 The brief of the CWA which formed out of the 1922 conference was to improve the conditions of women on the land. They adopted the motto \\"Honour to God, Loyalty to Throne, Service to the Country, Through Country Women, For Country Women, By Country Women.\\" The association expanded rapidly. By 1924 there were 120 branches with 4500 members and 21 rest rooms had been financed and fitted out. By 1927 membership had more than doubled and there were 191 branches. By 1928 it was the largest women's organisation in the state. By 1937, there were more than 17,000 members, 345 branches and 133 Younger Sets. By 1953 there were 28,000 members and 517 branches, 182 rest rooms, 157 baby health centres, holiday homes, rest homes, hospitals, school hostels and playgrounds. The CWA rest rooms in New South Wales country towns were the base of CWA activity. It was intended to be a \\"home away from home, where they could put their feet up, allow the kids to roam free, make a cup of tea and conduct meetings in dignity and comfort\\". The rest rooms were a source of community pride and continued to be built over the decades.Townsend, 1988, p22-23 Although the specific activities of individual branches varied, among other endeavours they supported the Bush Nursing Association, the Far West Children's Health Scheme, the Bush Book Club, Girl Guides, and Boy Scouts, Travellers Aid and the Flying Doctor Service. From the 1930s handicrafts featured prominently among the association's activities, and they also produced numerous cookbooks. Association news was regularly reported in the Stock and Station Journal and in 1937 the CWA's own journal was established. During World War II, many CWA activities were directed to supporting the war effort. They entertained and fed men in country training camps, supported the Australian Comforts Fund and knitted garments for soldiers. They particularly took on the task of making camouflage netting for the army from 1942. Over 400 camouflage netting circles were established, producing hundreds of thousands of nets by early 1944. In Barellan, the Younger Set made \\"Housewife\\" sewing kits which were sent to servicemen. Many women members were already stretched, having been left to run the family farm while their husbands were away fighting. In the postwar years the CWA took an interest in welcoming new migrants - meeting at least two ships a month and providing catering for 1000-2500 migrants at a time. They also helped families settle and invited women to branch meetings. Special services were set up for migrant women living in the Snowy Mountains. In the late 1950s some branches began to encourage Aboriginal women to join, although they have never been prominent among the membership.Australian Women's Register summarising Townsend, 1988; see also Jones, 2006 Although the CWA has in many ways defended traditional gender roles, it has advocated a greater public role for country women. It has also been outspoken on environmental issues. The women of the CWA, while believing deeply that their role in the family is vitally important, have been initiators, fighters and lobbyists. They have made localities into communities by providing social activities and educational, recreational and medical facilities. . . \\"They are radicals, insisting on better community facilities, yet the conservative guardians of traditional values.\\"(Australian Women's Register, quoting Townsend, 1988, pvii) From the late 1960s the numerical strength and influence of the CWA began to decline, although there has been some recent revival. In 2004 the Association had over 13,000 members and 500 local branches.(Australian Women's Register) =The Barellan Branch of the CWA and its Rest Home= The Barellan Branch of the CWA was formed at a meeting on 15 August 1922 held in the Barellan School of Arts. Mrs G. Gow was elected president, Mrs Sullivan secretary, and Mrs Cracknell treasurer. It was the ninth branch to be formed in New South Wales.O'Keefe & Semmler, p71 Initially meetings were held monthly at Mrs Sullivan's home with an attendance of six to twelve. The decision to build the centre followed a motion by a Mrs Field at a meeting on 12 April 1923. A place of rest and refreshment was needed by women and their children while in town during their husband's business related town visits; Barellan at that time only had one seat in the main street and summer weather could be particularly trying. The construction of the building is also indicative of the town's rapid growth at that time in response to the mid 1920s wheat boom.RNE entry, 1985 Throughout 1923 and 1924 the Barellan Branch of the CWA held socials, euchre parties, dances and a bazaar to help finance the building. Some locals attributed the success of these early functions to the fact that they tended to be held on evenings with a full moon so that those attending could drive their horses home safely at night. By November 1923 plans were ready to build a weatherboard Rest House at a cost of 650 pounds. The architect was G. W. A. Welch of Leeton who gave his services freely. The original cost of construction was 520 pounds and the contractors were probably Kinlock Brothers. The July 1924 edition of Gow's Gazette stated: \\"These ladies are to be congratulated on being a lively body, On their own initiative they set to work and build the first Rest Rooms in NSW. They had no funds to start with so with a series of dances etc, they raised 400 pounds\\". 'By July 1924, the Rest House was ready for opening and members held a tea party to entertain all who had assisted with the erection of their meeting room. It was decided to serve afternoon tea to the public every Saturday afternoon to help pay off the remaining debt. The charge was sixpence (6d.) for members, nine pence (9d.) for non-members. In this way the building was cleared of debt by May 1929.' Probably buoyed with their initial success, in May 1929 the Barellan Branch embarked on the greater project of building a hospital for the town - about six months before the stockmarket crash which marked the commencement of the Great Depression. Although a concrete hospital was erected by June 1930 and leased to a Dr Rutherford, it took many more years of hard work to pay off the building, helped by donations contributed from branches around NSW. Eventually in 1938 the hospital was handed over to the Hospitals Commission, to be administered by Griffith District Hospital. The building on Mulga Street is now occupied as a private residence. In 1934 establishing an occasional Baby Health Centre in the building became a priority. Purchasing the necessary furniture from donations, the centre was officially opened on 9 October 1934. The centre, with a Nursing Sister in attendance twice monthly, was finally moved to the Community Health Centre during the 1980s.' In December 1934 Barellan Branch also decided to form a Younger Set, inaugurated in March 1935. The Younger Set meeting room was added to the Rest House in 1941 at a cost of 31 pounds. This room is now part of the main meeting room. One of the major projects of Younger Set members was to raise money to purchase a piano for the parent branch at a cost of 317 pounds. The piano was proudly presented at the December meeting in 1953. In 2008 this piano was restored and repaired at a cost of $3000. The Younger set disbanded in 1963 owing to a decline in members.O'Keefe & Semmler, p73 'During the war years, members assisted the war effort, making camouflage nets, spinning wool, knitting socks and despatching pelts to the Sheepskin Vest committee. . . Over 500 articles were forwarded to the Comforts Fund.' Barellan members were also interested in handicrafts, holding cake decoration schools and craft displays. They succeeded in winning group trophies on many occasions. There was also keen interest in group activities such as International and Cultural Days, and participation in The Land cookery contest. In 1995 the branch began publishing a Community Phone Book, which has been a successful fund raising initiativeO'Keefe & Semmler, p71-2 The 50th anniversary of the Barellan Branch was celebrated in 1972 with a luncheon at the School of Arts, where the formative meeting had been held. Almost 200 members were present and a tree was planted in the Evonne Goolagong Park just to the east of the CWA Rest House, to commemorate the occasion (unfortunately, after a long drought this tree toppled onto one of the CWA chimney's during a storm in early 2011, luckily with little damage to the building - however the tree has been cut down to a stump). In 1988 the park adjacent to the Rest House was extended up to the western side of the building and named the Bicentennial Garden. Research conducted in this year by secretary Doreen Bewes-Pearson in 1988 confirmed that the Rest House was the first in Australia and a board was placed above the front entrance door to commemorate the 1924 opening of the Rest House. In 2002 the 80th birthday of the branch was celebrated at the Rest House, with many visitors and guests on the day. The 85th birthday of the branch was celebrated in 2007 with lunch at the Commercial Hotel.O'Keefe & Semmler, p72 The CWA Rest House has been extensively used by other local organisations over the years. In 1928 the Golf Club made it their headquarters. Since then Women's Bowls, Red Cross, Hospital Auxiliary, Senior Citizens, Far West Scheme, Lodges and the Show society have all held regular meetings there. In 1992 the Branch received a Sydney Morning Herald Community Service award for Narrandera Shire. Membership of the Barellan Branch has varied from around 20 in the 1920s to around 80 in the 1940s and around 50 in the 1960s. There were 27 members in 2011. Following research by secretary Doreen Bewes-Pearson in 1988, it was confirmed that the Rest House was the first to have been built in Australia, based on responses from each state branch of the CWA to the barellan branch's letter asking when their first rest house had been constructed. There was one rest room finished earlier, at Urana, but it was an existing room donated to the branch for their use, not a purpose-built CWA Rest House, since burnt down. A board was placed above the front entrance door to commemorate its opening in July 1924. In 2004 a larger sign was unveiled beside the Rest House in Bicentennial Garden, courtesy of the Narrandera Shire. In 1988 the park adjacent to the CWA Rest House was extended to the eastern side of the building and named the Bicentennial Garden. The same year the meeting room was enlarged by removing a dividing wall. A plaque was unveiled, stating \\"Dedicated to our pioneer members by the members of 1988\\". A leather covered Honour Roll book was made. An amplifier system was installed in the meeting room. The members organised the erection of a street stall shelter which is used by community groups on regular basis. During the past 15 years, Barellan CWA has received various grants, including an Australian Heritage Commission Grant. With money received, and the help of the local community, they have been able to replace the roof of the Rest House, paint and repair the building, lay new carpet, purchase and install new blinds and curtains. New chairs were obtained in 2007 while in 2008 pavers were laid to allow easier access to the Rest House. =George William Welch, architect= GWA Welch was born in 1887 in Hull, England and studied at the Royal Technical Institute at Salford in Lancashire 1908-11. He married Maude Hatcher in 1909 and migrated to Australian in 1912. He settled in Leeton where he worked on the construction of a pise church for the Anglicans; on sections of the cannery; dining room extensions at the Hydro Hotel; a new shop for H. Harmon now Wades Pharmacy and McGregors Newsagent; he designed St Mary's Convent (1926) and Richads & Co store (1938); was overseer for the Roxy Theatre and Wade Hotel (1930s). Early in the 1940s he moved with his family to Roseville in Sydney and became engaged in the war effort as a camouflage expert. After his son died in WWII he retired to Panania where he kept a small practice for local building works, ready to assist returned soldiers with their homes. He died in 1959 aged 79.  Description  The building is located on a lot owned by the CWA of NSW and run by the Barellan Branch of the CWA. The original structure built in 1924 was constructed in weatherboard with a gabled, corrugated iron roof and a verandah across the front and front sides of the building. The facilities initially included a large reading room, dressing room, store room and toilet. The west side verandah was enclosed in 1941 to make a separate meeting room for the \\"Younger Set\\". In 1988 the dividing wall (originally the external wall to the west) between the main room and the Younger Set meeting room was removed, resulting in a single large, L-shaped meeting room. There is now also a kitchen, store room and toilet. There are two chimneys which were rebuilt in 1999 using an Australian Heritage Commission National Estates Grant. The interiors feature intact patterned ceilings and cornices. Moveable heritage includes: * Piano donated by Younger Set in 1953, restored 2008; * Baby Health Centre relics including baby weigh scales, weighing child's chair, bassinet (the Barellan Branch of the CWA mentioned they are considering * giving these to the local museum where they can be more readily displayed to the public). * 'CWA' tea cups and saucers dating from the 1930s. * Trophies for cooking, craft and other activities. * Framed black and white photograph of the CWA Rest House Barellan in its early days. * Plaque dating from 1988 dedicated to pioneers. * Honour Roll dating from 1988 The building was reported to be in good condition as at 15 August 2011, following conservation works carried out in 1999 under an Australian Heritage Commission National Estates Grant (consisting largely of conserving chimneys, replacing roof, painting interiors and exterior). A tree situated to the immediate east of the building was associated with the site for many years but unfortunately was uprooted in a storm in early 2011 and had to be removed. = Modifications and dates = * 1928: The back of the Rest House painted and a sign erected, \\"CWA Rest House\\". * 1934: Baby Health Centre facilities are installed to allow for twice monthly clinics on the premises. * 1936: A new kitchen, stove and chimney are added behind the east verandah. * 1941: The west verandah is enclosed and clad in fibro to provide a room for \\"Younger Set\\" meetings. * 1940s: A disability ramp is added to the front verandah. * 1951: Electricity is connected. * 1953: A piano is donated by the Younger Set after considerable fund-raising efforts. * 1972: 50th anniversary celebrated with a tree planting in Evonne Goolagong Park. * 1988: The park adjacent to the Rest House is extended up to the western side of the building and named the Bicentennial Garden.

It was made in 1910 at Fitzroy Dock in Sydney. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The wooden wicket (or shutter) was one of a set of 55 collapsible Chanoine wickets originally incorporated in Berembed Weir. Berembed Weir was part of the scheme launched under Barren Jack and Murrumbidgee Canals Construction Act 1906. The wickets at Berembed Weir were the first weir gate regulators downstream from Burrinjuck Dam, and constituted a manual system of controlling the river flows and water supply to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas. The whole of the iron and timber work for these wickets was constructed in 1910 at the Fitzroy Dock at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney. The workmanship and cost received commendations from the then Chief Engineer, L. A. B. Wade. The wickets were manually manipulated from a punt moored upstream of the weir. The wickets continued to be in operation until 1977 when they were replaced by an automated weir system. One of the wickets, after its removal, was incorporated into a memorial in the Berembed Picnic Grounds commemorating the upgrading of the weir in 1977.(DLWC S170 Register)  Description  The wicket on display at the Berembed Picnic Grounds is the only remaining one of a set of 55 wickets originally operated at Berembed Weir. It is mounted on a concrete plinth. A bronze plaque, commemorating the completion of the upgrading of Berembed Weir was unveiled by Lin Gordon, MLA, Minister for Conservation and for Water Resources on 23 September 1977, and is mounted on the wicket. The wicket measures 901mm (2' 11.5\\"\\")wide, and is made of 6 tallow-wood planks 7602mm (3\\") thick at the top and 152mm (6\\") at the bottom. The planks are bolted together and strongly braced, supported at the back by a trestle and a wrought iron spurbrace working in a cast-iron \\"hurter\\" or support. The wicket on display was reported to be showing signs of environmental degradation as at 8 December 2000, with the timber sections at the base suffering from rot.  Heritage listing  The wicket is the only one remaining of a set of 55 Chanoine wickets originally incorporated at the Berembed Weir. It is a good representative of the early river flow control system. The iron and timber work of the wicket is a good example of the excellent workmanship by workers at the then government owned Fitzroy Dock. Now used as a memorial, it commemorates the 1977 upgrading of the weir. Wooden Wicket, Berembed Weir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was designed by Ernest de Burgh and built from 1909 to 1910 by the New South Wales Department of Public Works. It is also known as Berembed Diversion Weir. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Berembed Diversion Weir is the main weir built under the Barren Jack and Murrumbidgee Canals Construction Act 1906. It was to divert water from the Murrumbidgee River into the Main Canal via an offtake regulator. The Weir was designed and its construction supervised by the Rivers Water Supply & Drainage Branch of the New South Wales Department of Public Works in 1909-10. Berembed is an Aboriginal name for \\"a heap of rocks\\". It was where the low hills near the river stood well above the flood levels and a wide granite bar extended under the river bed and banks. The Principal Chief Engineer, L. A. B. Wade, decided that this was a good combination for the siting of a diversion weir to divert water down the main supply canal. The Diversion Weir comprised a weir proper with 55 collapsible Chanoine wooden wickets, a lock chamber capable of taking barges or steamers up to 100 ft. (30.48m) long, and a sluiceway. An off-take regulator was built at right angle to the weir at the head of the Main Canal. In 1976-7, the weir was refurbished and the wooden wickets were replaced with fixed concrete which extends across the southern two-thirds of the river's width. In 1977, the Berembed Picnic Grounds was officially opened by the Hon. Lin Gordon MLA, Minister for Water Resources.(DLWC S170 Register) The staff cottage was destroyed by fire in 2012.  Description  The Weir is founded on a solid granite bar extending across the river. It is 82.3m (270') between abutments, and is divided into a sluiceway 12.19m (40') wide, a lock chamber 12.19m (40') wide, and a concrete weir 50.29m (165') wide. The sluiceway and lock chamber area each controlled at their upstream ends by single iron-framed sluice gates of the \\"Stoney\\" pattern manufactured by Ransomes & Rapier of Ipswich, England. The total lift of the gates is 10.67m (35'). The original lock-gates at the downstream end of the lock chamber have been removed. The off-take regulator has 10 gates. The gates were originally of tallow-wood and were each in 3 leaves. These gates and the lifting gear were constructed at the Government Fitzroy Dock in Sydney. The gates have since been replaced. The site contains other early structures such as staff cottage, timber pilings, wicket memorial, and rare native flora and fauna.  Heritage listing  Berembed Division Weir is an integral and important part of the ambitious scheme launched under the Barren Jack and Murrimbidgee Canals Act 1906. It is an important structure in the control and diversion of water flow into the Main Canal to the Murrimbidgee Irrigation Area and surrounding districts.

It was established by brothers Anthony and Gabriel Boulos. The company houses several notable brands such as Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, and Haojue. It is the sole importer and distributor of Suzuki in Nigeria. Michael Boulos, who is Tiffany Trump's current partner since 2018, is an heir to the company's fortune. History The Boulos' history began in Lagos, at a store that sold jewelry and other small articles to the upper-middle class. The jewelry business was managed by their father, George Boulos, a Lebanese goldsmith who immigrated to Nigeria in 1936. George developed good relationships with his clients which proved to benefit the business as it matured. In the mid-1950s, George's sons, Anthony and Gabriel, expanded the family business by importing Miele, Durkopp, and G√∂ricke motorcycles. The company's profile expanded from there, leading to the incorporation of the company in 1964. By the end of the 1960s the firm had established a factory in Oregun, Lagos, which assembled Suzuki motorcycles made from partial or completely knocked down parts, thus becoming the first company in Nigeria to assemble motorcycles. Furthermore, the plant had the capacity to assemble 7,200 motorcycles per shift. In 1979, when the government of Nigeria placed a ban on the importation of completely built motorcycles, the Boulos' profile enhanced, causing the firm to become the leading motorcycle seller in the country. In 1975 the firm acquired land at the Ogba Industrial estate, beginning the process of manufacturing complete Suzuki motorcycles. The company also developed a distribution strategy which led to the creation of service centers across the country. These centers were capable stocking spare parts as well as including a trained Suzuki mechanic at each location. In 1985, the Boulos family diversified their interests in Nigeria with the establishment of Bel Impex Limited, a leading tissue paper manufacturer.\\"Nigeria-CPLF - BEL IMPEX PROJECT.\\" MENA Report (2013) Between 2010 and 2016, Boulos Enterprises represented Piaggio India while partially assembling tricycles in the country.

In July 2018, he broke the 800m Australian record with a time of 1:44.21, which had stood since the 1968 Mexico Olympics. Biography Deng was born in Kakuma, Kenya where a UNHCR refugee camp was established in 1969. His mother Rebecca left Sudan to escape the Second Sudanese Civil War. In 2004, his family moved to Toowoomba, Queensland when he was six and in 2010 he moved to Ipswich at the age of 12. He first attended Raceview State School and then Ipswich Grammar School. In an interview, Deng said that \\"he identifies himself as Sudanese, he identifies himself as Australian.\\" Athletics career Whilst at Raceview State School he was encouraged to attend after-school athletics coaching at Ipswich Grammar School under the guidance of coach Di Sheppard. He was granted a scholarship at Ipswich Grammar School and continued to be coached by Sheppard. His uncle John Deng also played a role in his development. At the age of 17, he was selected in the Australian team for the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships. He finished third in the 800 m semi-final in 1:48.49 but failed to qualify for the final. Later in 2016, he ran a personal best of 1:46.51. In 2016, he moved to Melbourne to be coached by Justin Rinaldi who coached Alexander Rowe to run 1:44.40, equalling the Ralph Doubell 's Australian record. In 2018, he was controversially selected to compete in 800 m at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Gold Coast, Queensland after not qualifying for the final at the Australian Athletics Championships. But in the B final he ran a personal best of 1:45.71 and was subsequently selected. At the Games, he finished seventh in the 800m final in 1:47.20. On 20 July 2018, at the IAAF Diamond League meeting in Monaco he finished seventh in the 800m but broke the Australian record with a time of 1:44.21. The previous Australian record of 1:44.40 was set by Ralph Doubell in winning the gold medal at altitude at the 1968 Mexico Olympics and equaled in 2014 by Alexander Rowe in Monaco. Deng's record also broke New Zealander Peter Snell's Oceania record of 1:44.3 that was set in Christchurch in 1962. At the end of the 2018 season, Deng had run four times under 1.45 in the year, the most ever by an Australian. Deng has also been credited for his ability to run sprint distances. He boasts a 47.25 over the 400m and a wind- aided 22.24 200m. Following the political controversy surrounding purported \\"African crime gangs\\" in Melbourne, Deng was cited by the ABC as \\"a track star of boundless potential\\" and \\"proof positive of what immigrants can offer to their adopted country when given the opportunity.\\"  References  External links Joseph Deng at Athletics Australia Joseph Deng at Australian Athletics Historical Results * Joseph Deng at Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Australian male middle-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2018 Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Australia Category:Australian people of South Sudanese descent Category:South Sudanese refugees Category:Sudanese refugees ","title":"Joseph Deng"},{"id":"57954982","text":"The Pure Oil Service Station in Lavonia, Georgia, located at 56 West Ave., was built in 1935.

His two ATP Tour main draw appearances in singles both came at the Croatia Open Umag, as a qualifier in 2000 and as a wildcard entrant in the 2001 tournament. In June 2001 he reached his best ranking of 223 in the world and made the second round of qualifying at the Wimbledon Championships. Later that year he appeared for the Croatia Davis Cup team in a World Group qualifying tie against Italy in Rome. He featured in a dead rubber reverse singles match, which he lost to Italian Filippo Volandri. Retiring in 2007, Vajda now works as a tennis coach based in Zagreb, where he runs a tennis academy.

He maintains a studio in San Pedro, California. He received a Masters in Fine Art from California State University, Fullerton, and he is a grant recipient from the National Endowment for the Arts, among others. His work is in museums, galleries across the United States. His significant body of public art is found in rail stations, public parks and civic buildings across the United States and in Japan. He is the co-author and subject of PROGRESS: In Search of the American Esthetic, an exhibition that features photographs, video projections, audio and ephemera documenting artists Michael Davis and Stephen Moore‚Äôs cross- country trip by car from California to New York in 1970 and their subsequent trip traveling the same route in reversing, from New York to California.  Influences  An early influence was Downey High School art teacher Ray White. White was a graduate of Chouinard Art Institute, the influential school that served as an incubator for early Los Angeles contemporary artists. White introduced Davis to the work of Italian abstract expressionist Rico Lebrun, as well as the German Bauhaus School of Art, that combined crafts and fine arts.http://bauhausinteriors.com/blog/the-bauhaus-movement/ American installation artist Robert Irwin influenced Davis in the relationship of separation of public and private space. Irwin's public art maintains a focus in creating subtle, at times vanishing environments with plain materials. Growing up in the midst of cold war America, Davis was highly influenced by the ever-present threat of communism and imminent nuclear war.  Criticism and commentary Davis was included in a compilation of Los Angeles Artists, L.A.Rising, SoCal Artists Before 1980. The compilation by Lynn Kienholz, documented the work of 500 important artists working in Los Angeles during the growth of the seminal art scene. In that book Walter Hopps wrote: \\"Davis's works have a strong iconographic content...not only is there an interest in architectural form, but also a kind of mythology...It's crafted and put together like something on the fringes of urban society.\\".L.A. Rising, SoCal Artists before 1980 pg.133/ Christopher Miles said of Davis: \\"Davis‚Äô practice is clearly informed by a long personal history on the part of the artist with direct engagement in the discourses of conceptual art practice, situational aesthetics, semiotics, deconstruction, and the critique of representation‚Ä¶. Though in ways elegaic, but not sentimental or nostalgic, Davis‚Äô work aspires to be art of his epoch, and perhaps even for his epoch‚Äìan art that engages with shared experience and endeavor, shared excitement and shared angst.\\" Howard N.

It was discovered by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist Aurel Stein at the Library Cave (cave 17) of the Mogao Caves in 1908. The painting is in the British Museum in London.  Description  The figure is represented in a three-quarter view in a manner very similar to some of the paintings of Bodhisattvas, even to the gesture of the right hand. The outer circle of the nimbus has flame-like decoration. He has a fairly thick moustache and a slight beard, both in red. He is wearing a silk stole of red with a yellow lining, over a garment that has faded to a greenish colour very similar to that of the background. The sleeves of the garment end in ruffs and golden bracelets adorn the wrists. A cross, each arm that ends in extensions of beads, appears both in the headdress of the figure and pendant of the necklace that he is wearing, as well as on the top of the long staff that he is holding in the left hand.  Analysis  The cross-on-lotus symbol carved on the Nestorian Stele, which can also be seen in the headdress worn by the figure in this painting. According to Meicun Lin (a professor of the School of Archeology and Museology at Peking University) and Szonja Buslig (a lecturer of E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University), they believe that the style of this painting deliberately imitates the reliefs at Taq-i Bustan, a site with a series of large rock reliefs from the era of Sasanian Empire. For example, both have nimbi, wear similar necklaces, and even basic positions are very similar. It is speculated that this painting was made based on the icon of Christ that the Persian missionary Alopen carried to Chang'an, the capital of the Tang Empire. The figure with the right hand held open and the thumb touching the middle finger, which is a variant of the , the gesture of discussion and transmission of the teachings, it is generally seen in the Hindu and Buddhist iconography. At first glance, the figure resembles a Bodhisattva, but the western features of the face, together with the red mustache and beard, which are quite different from the green, curling moustaches of Bodhisattvas, begin to hint at a different type of holy figure. That the figure is Christian is evident from the cross on the lotus in the headdress, a symbol can also be seen on the Nestorian Stele, the cross pattern on the necklace, the cross pendant and the staff of a processional cross. The headdress decorated with wings is known from the Kushano-Sasanian art and symbolises sovereignty, the curls at the shoulders remind us of the images of Gandhara Buddha. The narrow flame border of the nimbus is found throughout the Buddhist iconography of Central Asia. The background is scattered with small flowers which may serve to enhance the sanctity, and therefore the devotion (bhakti).  Image of Christ  According to the German professor and Swiss scholar Christoph Baumer, ‚Äúthe figure represents Jesus Christ or a saint‚Äù. , a Japanese historian and professor of Kyoto University, argues that ‚Äúthe unearthed in Tunhwang must be an image of Christ‚Äù. P. Y. Saeki, the Japanese scholar of religion, also considers the painting to be an icon of Jesus.

The design of the building was variously attributed to Ernest Rees Laver or Charles Bundock. It was built in 1902 by Englebert Albert Schuller and Charles Bundock. It is also known as The Dome. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 August 2015.  History  The early development of Narrandera township on the Murrumbidgee River began in the 1860s with the opening of land to selection. The township's early dependence on the unreliable steamboat trade (that was subject to drought and flood) gave way to a new era of development and prosperity with the extension of the railway line from Junee through Narrandera to Hay in 1882 and in 1884 from Narrandera to Jerilderie. The Borough of Narrandera was proclaimed in 1885. By 1901 its population had doubled to reach 2,255. Narrandera was one of the most progressive towns in the colony. Its wealth derived from its strong pastoral and agricultural base and its location on a railway junction that gave rise to a diverse range of industries that processed agricultural raw materials: timber, wool scours, soap works, flour-mills and meat chilling. The first pastoral and agricultural show in Narrandera was held in 1882, (the same year that the Sydney Easter Show moved to the Moore Park Showground). The Sydney Morning Herald of 2 September 1882 described the inaugural Narrandera show as a great success. Following an application to the Minister for Lands, the Narrandera Pastoral and Agricultural Association was granted a site of six ha (15 acres) as a showground. The land was dedicated on 16 March 1883, a further 3.6 ha (nine acres) being added on 14 November 1893, and another four ha (10 acres) on 12 August 1903, making a total of 13.75 ha (34 acres). The economic depression of the 1890s was followed by drought across eastern Australia. The King Drought of 1895-1903 was the most prolonged since European settlement, its worst year being 1902-03. The Narrandera Argus noted in 1902 that local stock numbers for horses, cattle and sheep had plummeted between 1901 and 1902 and there was concern that the drought would have an adverse impact on the forthcoming 1902 show. The Argus commented: \\"It must be readily acknowledged that seasons such as the district has passed through must of necessity have a prejudicial effect upon all pastoral and agricultural products. But when it is an accepted fact that of late years those who managed to keep their stock alive are regarded as fortunate, and that few farmers have reaped any produce - even of an inferior quality - it is unreasonable to assume that a show following seven years of drought is properly representative of the fertility of the district\\". ('Narrandera Argus', January 30, 1902). Reporting on the 1902 show, the Narrandera Argus claimed that the 20th annual show was \\"Successful Beyond Anticipation. There was an overall increase in nearly all categories, but most noticeably in the Industrial Arts, where categories included Needle and Fancy Work, Drawing and School Work, Cookery, Painting, Drawing and Photography, and Fruit and Flowers\\" ('Narrandera Argus', August 1902). The construction of the purpose-built Industrial Hall for the 1902 show arguably assisted in generating the increased number of entries in this category. Agricultural shows at that time were significant events in the community and special trains were often scheduled to bring visitors from adjacent towns. Narrandera's location on a railway junction and the showground's position within walking distance of the station positioned it well to draw attendance from neighbouring towns as well as the surrounding district. The show was a collective demonstration of a community's ability and played a social, as well as an economic, function. A community that could put on a good show, particularly in the midst of a severe drought, was demonstrating not only its capacity but also its resilience. The purpose of the Industrial Hall was to demonstrate the range of art, craft, domestic skills and school work of the women and children of the district. Reporting on the 1903 Annual General Meeting of the Narrandera Pastoral and Agricultural Association, the Narrandera Argus noted that the 'improvements on the ground at this time were ring, grandstand, sheep and poultry sheds, fine arts pavilion [presumably the 1902 Industrial Hall], caretaker's cottage, yards and fencing'. Exhibits were originally displayed on wooden benches. In 1956 the Narrandera builder G. L. (George) Hinchey and his apprenticed son, Ian, built fine, painted timber and glass display cabinets for the Industrial Hall (one, along the eastern wall, is the surviving remnant of the original cabinets). They consisted of a freestanding central cabinet and cabinets lining all the internal walls. They provided a continuous display area with several lift-up glass covers and were used for the display of competition produce such as cakes and jams. In 1903 it was reported that the \\"Committee recommend that a new Industrial Hall should be erected (in which class the exhibitions are largely increasing), if the funds of the Association will permit\\" ('Narrandera Argus', January 30, 1903). Further research of the \\"Narrandera Argus\\" up to and including the AGM of January 1904 has revealed no further reference to this second hall. No additional documentary research has been undertaken but it is believed that the second hall was constructed before 1910. Historical photographs show a rectilinear weatherboard and corrugated-iron roofed building abutting the Industrial Hall on the south side. Evidence of this building can also be seen in the Industrial Hall's fabric and in the building's footprint. This second hall was of rougher construction than the 1902 Industrial Hall and was eventually demolished in the 1950s or 1960s. The hall viewed from Elizabeth Street The designer of the 1902 Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is disputed. Some oral evidence attributes the building's design to Laver and Schular. Jack Driscoll, the well-regarded local historian advised that the builder of the hall was Charles Bundock. This is also noted on the information board within the Industrial Hall. Builders W. & C. (Charles P.) Bundock were responsible for the construction of many fine buildings in Narrandera including St John's United Church in 1907 (with its copper sheathed spire) and The Star Hotel in 1916. Ernest Rees Laver was an architect with the Victorian Public Works Department in the 1880s who moved to NSW establishing his practice in Narrandera from 1893 to 1902. Laver was responsible for the design of the Grandstand of Narrandera Showground, built in the same year as the Industrial Hall (but destroyed by fire in 1907) as well as the Nowra Showground Pavilion (1905) and a range of domestic, commercial, religious and public buildings in Narrandera and the surrounding region. The Industrial Hall is the only building of state significance on the Narrandera Showground site. The 1907 Grandstand (that replaced the 1902 Grandstand) was a cypress pine-framed building with oregon cladding. It was demolished in the 1970s due to white ant infestation and dry rot. Other buildings on the showground site are of later construction ( late 1950s-70s).  Description  Rear view The Industrial Hall on Narrandera Showground is an example of the Federation Free Classical style of architecture (a style which dates from 1890 to 1915) which is characterised by symmetry, classical proportions and absence of detail with a playful quality. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is a small, single-storey, octagonal, weatherboard building with a bell-curved, domed corrugated iron roof. The building measures 11m to the top of the dome that was formerly surmounted by a metal, louvred ventilator that was topped with a mini dome and a flagpole (the ventilator, dome and flagpole are now missing). The eaves are supported with curved timber brackets which are set above an external timber cornice. The building's octagon is not equal sided, but is more in the nature of a square with splayed corners. Interior view, showing display cases around the walls The fifteen- pane windows are mounted in the four shorter sides of the octagon, with sill heights 2.4 m from ground level to provide a larger area of uninterrupted internal wall space for display. The windows have lintels 4.7 m high and multi-coloured glass in the upper window panes. There are two doors, in the east and west longer walls. The eastern door, which appears to be original, is solid timber and comprises two units that slide open on an overhead track. The western door is a newer roller door. The internal walls are of vertical weatherboards to approximately one metre and then horizontal boards to the wall plate, which is about 4.8 metres above the floor. A series of primary and secondary curved laminated timber ribs support the roof and ceiling, which again is composed of horizontal purlins and vertical tongue and grooved boards. The primary ribs meet at a decayed octagonal timber ring beam, which supported the former vent. There is a spoke of steel cross-ties at top plate level. A painted timber and glass display cabinet fitted to the eastern wall of the building is the surviving remnant of the cabinets constructed in 1956 that originally lined the walls with a freestanding central cabinet. The missing cabinets were probably removed after 1996 due to white ant infestation. The wooden planks on steel supports along the western wall of the Industrial Hall are not specific to this building but move between it and the Pioneer Hall on the showground. Internally, the high walls, large high-set windows and the exposed ceiling structure of the domed roof create a remarkable, spacious and well-lit interior. An information board within the building states: \\"Building constructed about 1902 - cost 367 pounds - built by Charles Bundock - the only building of this design still in service in Australia. Note there was another building of this design built in Innisfail Queensland which was burnt down some forty years ago. Building is listed by the Heritage Council\\". The building was painted in 1993. Previously the roof was unpainted corrugated galvanised iron and the lead ridges were more pronounced. Prior to the 1970s the building was undermined by rabbits and started to sink. During the 1970s, extensive renovations were carried out. The building was restumped and rests on cement bricks in the centre and pipes embedded in concrete around the sides. It now stands about 20 cm above ground level, with wire mesh around the bottom. Guttering and down pipes have been renewed. Cross-braced ties have been placed externally on the four main sides. = Condition = As at 23 May 2006, the building is in fair condition only. From a distance it appears straight and true however, closer inspection reveals potential structural problems. Internally, the roof ribs have started to delaminate and their upper ends, where loads are meant to distribute to the upper ring beam, have been completely eaten away by termites and much of the ring beam is missing. As a consequence the purlins must now be carrying the structural loads. A layer of mesh and plastic has been laid over the internal steel cross-ties to catch falling parts of the decaying structure. Some of the internal lining boards have come loose and need attention, and generally the building needs painting. There have been minor alterations to the structure, including the addition of the roller door, slight changes to fenestration, introduction of steel bracing rods and the loss of the metal ventilator, mini dome and flagpole. However, the building is largely intact and continues to clearly express a strong sense of architectural design. = Modifications and dates = A rectilinear weatherboard and corrugated-iron roofed building abutted the Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall on the south side, evidence of which can be seen in diagonal cuts in the eaves bracket cornice and in photographs. The level footprint of this building can still be discerned in the ground. This building was demolished, probably in the 1950s or 1960s. The building was restumped in the 1970s. As a result the building's stability was threatened and the internal timber bracing started to pull away. A few years after the restumping (and prior to 1978) the steel rod cross bracing was installed by members of the Show Society. It was probable that internal steel cross-ties were added at this time, although this has not been fully explored. The cement brick piers were retro-fitted when the cross bracing was added. The former roof ventilator, mini dome and flagpole were removed, probably in the late 1980s. The mini dome and ventilator were affected with dry rot and disintegrated on removal. The flagpole is believed to have survived but its current location is uncertain. A historical photograph shows these removed structures in place, together with a rectilinear weatherboard and corrugated- iron roofed building that abutted the Industrial Hall and which was demolished in the 1950s or 1960s. The building exterior was painted in 1993.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance as a rare example of a distinctive design of showground building. It is the only surviving building of its design and type known to exist on a showground in New South Wales. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall's distinctive and imposing character derives from its over- sized scale created by an octagonal form with a bell-shaped, domed roof and large, high set windows. Internally, this building form (with its exposed ceiling structure) has created a remarkable, spacious and well-lit interior that served its exhibition function with excellence. A surviving 1956 painted timber and glass display cabinet remains fitted to the eastern wall of the building. The building design is representative of the Federation Free Classical style of architecture that was characterised by formal classicism with a playful quality and exemplified the stability and prosperity of its occupants. A style that was mainly confined to large urban properties, its use in a small, timber rural structure is uncommon. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance as surviving evidence of the resilience and capacity of a rural and regional community during a period of prolonged adversity. Constructed in 1902, the hall was built during the worst year of the Federation Drought (1895-1903), the most protracted and severe drought to affect the eastern region of Australia since European settlement. At a time when Australia's rural prospects were spiralling into a deep slump and rural communities were financially and emotionally devastated, the residents of Narrandera sought to celebrate their district, its people and the future prosperity of the region through the construction of the Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall. Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 August 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance as surviving evidence of the resilience and capacity of a rural and regional community during a period of prolonged adversity. Constructed in 1902, the hall was built during the worst year of the Federation Drought (1895-1903), the most protracted and severe drought to affect the eastern region of Australia since European settlement. An economic and social catastrophe for Australia, the Federation Drought resulted in the decimation of rural communities, crops, livestock and the wider environment and landscape across the country. At a time when Australia's rural prospects were spiralling into a deep slump, many farmers and rural communities simply walked away from their debts and the devastation of their drought-caused losses. The people of Narrandera, however, sought to celebrate their district, its people and the anticipated future prosperity of the region through the construction of the Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall. Constructed during the worst year of the drought and at a time when rural communities were financially and emotionally devastated, the unique and ambitious structure served to demonstrate the town's prosperity and aspirations and the community's positive outlook in the face of protracted drought. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall has associations with founding members of the local community, in particular the Narrandera Pastoral and Agricultural Association. The building also has local significance for its association with the regional architect Ernest Rees Laver. Its design has been attributed to Laver who was a member of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects and who worked for the Victorian Public Works Department in the 1880s before settling in Narrandera in 1893. Laver was also responsible for the showground's grandstand (destroyed in 1907) and a number of other civic buildings in the Narrandera area. Laver later moved his practice to Cootamundra in 1902. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values. It is a rare example of a distinctive architectural structure among NSW showground buildings of the Victorian and Federation eras. The distinctive and imposing character of the hall derives from its unusual octagonal form and bell-shaped roof. The over-sized scale of this small building is both intriguing and exemplary for its purpose. It is an example of the Federation Free Classical style of architecture whose principal characteristics are formal classicism with a playful quality as expressed by symmetry, elegantly proportioned shapes and simple detail with elements of variety and surprise. Federation Free Classical was generally an urban style that exemplified the wealth and stability of a civic area and, after a period of severe drought at the turn of the century, the rural community of Narrandera were intent on demonstrating these attributes. This hall resembles the domes of vast Beaux-Arts buildings, a style that followed French fashions. Internally, the large curved and laminated ribs of the striking ceiling composition demonstrate technical competence at the time. The combination of octagonal form, high walls, high and diffused glazing and the exposed ceiling structure create a remarkable and well-lit internal space that was an excellent vehicle for the exhibition of arts and crafts. The design of the building has been attributed to the regional architect Ernest Rees Laver. None of Laver's known surviving buildings reflects the appearance of the Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall, although some similarities with his use of the Federation Free Classical style are evident. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall has social significance at the local level as it has served the Narrandera community as a display pavilion for more than a century. The major structural work of 1978 and the exterior painting in 1993 demonstrate that the building is valued by its community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is significant at a local level for its capacity to provide distinctive and rare material evidence of the role and contribution of a rural community (and in particular its women and children) to that community's social and economic prosperity following a period of unprecedented adversity. The site may have archaeological potential of local significance if further investigation of the formally adjoining building is undertaken. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance for its rare, distinctive and intriguing architecture amongst other showground buildings in the state. It is the only building of its design and type known to exist in New South Wales. Several industrial hall buildings were erected on showgrounds in the same period as Narrandera. However it is considered that the hall at Narrandera may be the only surviving building of its architectural nature in the state. An uncommon example of the Federation Free Classical style of architecture, applied to a utilitarian building in a rural setting, the hall is a small building constructed of in a radically different design and scale. Its design has been attributed to the regional architect Ernest Rees Laver. None of Laver's known surviving buildings is similar in appearance to the Industrial Hall. A similar structure was thought to exist on the showground at Innisfail, Queensland, but it was destroyed by fire many years ago. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is of state heritage significance for its capacity to demonstrate a significant architectural variation to the usual range of showground buildings in NSW. Showgrounds often have idiosyncratic and distinctive structures (such as grandstands, pavilions, entry gates and kiosks) which reflect local design skills, available building materials, or a particular historical context. The Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall is representative of this tradition.

A Khalistani sympathizer and member of the now- banned militant group International Sikh Youth Federation, he was also involved in the 1985 attack of Ujjal Dosanjh, a strong opposer of the Khalistani movement who would later become the 33rd Premier of British Columbia. In 2010, he was accused of being part of an automobile fraud case but was ruled out by the Supreme Court of Canada. In February 2018, Atwal gained national attention when he was invited by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to a reception during a visit to India and would eventually have his invitation revoked the next day. That same year, he was arrested for issuing death threats to a local radio in British Columbia.  Background  Jaspal Atwal was originally from Pharala near Phagwara district in Punjab, India. He left for Canada at a young age and claimed to study at British Columbia Institute of Technology. He visited India once in the past few years, with a Facebook post of him visiting the Taj Mahal. He is involved in construction business and is currently associated with Media Wave Communications, which runs a Surrey-based online radio station. He was also involved in numerous liberal campaigns and was seen taking pictures with hockey star Wayne Gretzky and other liberal politicians such as Sukh Dhaliwal, Justin Trudeau, and Michael Ignatieff.  Controversies  = Assassination attempts = In 1985, Atwal was charged in an attack on Ujjal Dosanjh, a strong opposer of the Khalistan movement, but was later acquitted. Dosanjh stated that Atwal attacked him with an iron bar over his opposition to Sikh extremism. The attack left Dosanjh severely injured with 80 stitches and a broken hand. Senior Punjab journalist Baljit Balli, who met Atwal during a radio talk show at Surrey, said that Atwal had claimed that he was not involved in any attack and that he was being wrongly charged. Dosanjh would go on to be the 33rd Premier of British Columbia. On May 25, 1986, Atwal was among four men involved in attempting to assassinate Punjib minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu. He was convicted for murder and was sentenced to 20 years in jail, where he served 5 years before being paroled. At the time of the attempted assassination, Sidhu was visiting Vancouver for a wedding and was forced off an isolated road near Gold River when Atwal arrived. Sidhu was struck twice and survived the shooting, however, he was assassinated in 1991 five years later at his home. At the parole, Atwal admitted he was the shooter that day. = Justin Trudeau visit to India = Atwal sparked controversy when he was invited by Justin Trudeau to a reception during a visit to India. He was seen photographed with Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau and Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi at an event in Mumbai and was invited to the event by Randeep Sarai. Ujjal Dosanjh criticized Trudeau for inviting Atwal by stating \\"Do you have no shame?\\" and stated that the relations between Canada and India were rock bottom. Atwal's invitation was rescinded the next day and Trudeau stated that he should have never been invited. He was removed from India's travel blacklist several months ago, while the Indian government stated that he wasn't a security threat. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Trudeau of \\"wining and dining\\" with an attempted murderer in a Thursday tweet. Atwal stated that he has a \\"friendly relationship\\" with Trudeau and that he \\"stayed away\\" from him to avoid embarrassment. On March 8, 2018, he apologized for the \\"embarrassment\\" he caused when he attended the event and told reporters that he took full responsibility for his past actions. A new committee of reporters and senators delivered its first classified report regarding the affair with 18 findings and 6 recommendations concerning allegations of foreign interference in Canadian political affairs. = Death threats against a British Columbia host = On April 25, 2018, Atwal was arrested at his home and charged for making threats to a local British Columbia host. According to documents, he faces charges for \\"uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm\\". His lawyer Marvin Stern stated that he made threats outside a Punjabi radio station in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey, British Columbia. The day after his arrest, he made an appearance in provincial court, but was released without cash or surety. He is expected to face trial on June 7 and appear at the Surrey Provincial Court to plead not guilty.  Involvement in Canadian politics  In 2012, Atwal was invited to a budget speech of 35th Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark as a guest. In addition, he backed her leadership and was among supporters who accorded her a welcome in Surrey. His presence in the legislature caused embarrassment and a complaint was made to the speaker. Clark's reaction was similar to Wai Young when she received help from Ripudaman Singh Malik, who was acquitted in the Air India Flight 182 bombing. Clark insisted that she didn't know who Atwal was, even though he was invited to her budget speech and shook her hand. After the controversy, liberal party director Tariq Ghuman resigned. Atwal was also a member of the Surrey Fleetwood-Port Kells Liberal riding association of the Federal Liberal Party. In a January 14, 2013 post on Facebook, Atwal was seen in a photo with a young Justin Trudeau. Atwal is a long-time supporter of the Liberal Party and a former donor to the federal gifts with deep ties to the party that pre- date Trudeau's tenure as prime minister. Official records showed that he donated $500 to the Liberal Party on April 9, 2011. In May 2015, the Toronto Sun obtained two photos of him with Trudeau, with one at a campaign event in Vancouver and another one outside a house or restraint. He was also seen taking pictures with former liberal leader Michael Ignatieff and interim leader Bob Rae.

It was designed by John Whitton in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, and built in 1884-85 by Halliday & Owen with ironwork supplied by English firm Westwood, Baillie. It is also known as Narrandera Lattice Railway Bridge. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and was added to the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate on 15 May 1990.  History  =Iron lattice truss bridges= During the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression. Despite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads (William C. Bennett) and for Railways (John Whitton) were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridgeworks, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges. However, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments. Both Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, 10 on railways and 18 on roads. The current railway lattice bridges are: * 1876Macquarie River bridge at Bathurst * 1881Macquarie River at Wellington * 1882Peel River bridge at Tamworth * 1882MacDonald River bridge at Woolbrook * 1884Murray River bridge at Albury * 1884Macquarie River bridge at Dubbo * 1885Murrumbidgee River at Narrandera * 1887Lachlan River bridge at Cowra Two former railway lattice bridges (1885 Georges River at Como and the 1886 Parramatta River bridge at Meadowbank) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways. The 1871 lattice railway bridge over the Hunter River at Aberdeen was replaced by steel girders and demolished. =Murrumbidgee River Bridge at Narrandera= The bridge was built in 1884-85 by Halliday and Owen, the contractors for the overall Narrandera- Jerilderie railway project. It was reported to be the only great engineering challenge on that stretch of line. A temporary bridge was erected during construction which carried the initial services over the river. Delays in the completion of the permanent bridge resulted in the formal opening of the line being delayed until July 1885. The Tocumwal railway line was formally closed in December 1988. The possibility of reopening the Tocumwal line remains a subject of occasional discussion, with reports supporting returning the bridge to active use were the line to reopen.  Description  The Murrumbidgee River railway bridge at Narrandera is a two-span continuous iron lattice bridge. The spans are to centres of piers and the lattice work has four triangulations. The piers are pairs of cast iron cylinders (supplied by Stockton Forge Co, England). The bridge carries a single railway with transomes on metal stringers with metal crossgirders resting on the lower chords. The main trusses are through type lattice trusses, continuous over two spans. They are connected together above the track by characteristic arched latticed braces. They are supported on twin cast iron cylinder piers. The superstructure was fabricated by Westwood, Baillie; Halliday and Owen were the principal contractors. It was placed in service in May 1885. It was reported to be in good physical condition as at 26 April 2006. It retains its original fabric apart from relatively minor technical works of repair and strengthening. A 2012 report stated that the bridge \\"appears to be sound and would be likely to require only minimal repair and upgrade works\\" were it to be returned to use.  Heritage listing  This bridge is a member of the most significant group of colonial bridges in New South Wales. Collectively, as items of railway infrastructure, it contributed significantly to the history and development of New South Wales. The bridge is an imposing structure at its site. In terms of contemporary bridge technology the wrought iron lattice bridge was among the best for major bridgeworks. Narrandera rail bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Twelve wrought iron lattice railway bridges were built in New South Wales during the boom period for railway construction 1871-1887, starting at Aberdeen and ending at Cowra. Nine of the survivors are owned and managed by the Rail Access Corporation. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. All nine iron lattice railway bridges are imposing structures. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Every iron lattice railway bridge crossed a major river which made it possible for the railway extension to develop the districts reached, socially and commercially The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The iron lattice bridge was a technically sound structure for the bridge technology of the late colonial period. Its strength and durability have shown it to have been a very cost-effective form of bridge.

The character is depicted as a 14-year-old high school student who was adopted by Aunt May and Uncle Ben following the death of her father/caretaker. She pilots a psychically-powered mech suit built by her father known as the SP//dr, which is partially controlled by a radioactive spider that also shares a psychic link with Peni.Edge of Spider- Verse #5 (2014) The character was featured in Spider-Man: Into the Spider- Verse, with her voice provided by actress Kimiko Glenn. Publication history Peni Parker and SP//dr were created by writer Gerard Way and artist Jake Wyatt, and first appeared in the Spider-Verse comic book Edge of Spider- Verse #5 in October 2014. According to Way, SP//dr \\"is three vital components: a pilot, a machine, and a radioactive sentient spider acting as one half of the brain that makes it all work.\\" SP//dr‚Äôs story was continued in the Spider- Geddon comic book, Edge of Spider-Geddon #2 by Alberto Albuquerque. Fictional character biography Peni's father acted as the original pilot of the SP//dr mecha, in which he protected New York from crime and other dangers. After his mysterious death, Peni is approached by her Aunt May and Uncle Ben to become the new pilot of the SP//dr. In order to do so however, she has to be bitten by the sentient radioactive spider which controls part of the suit. Soon after being bitten, Peni becomes the new protector of the city. Five years later, she battles her universe‚Äôs version of Mysterio - an obsessed fanboy of her's. Peni eventually teams up with her universe's version of Daredevil ‚Äì who had known her father ‚Äì to battle a group of criminals before being approached by Spider-Ham and Old Man Spider to join the Spider-Army to fight the Inheritors. After the events of \\"Spider-Verse\\", Peni is approached by a girl named Addy Brock, who wonders if she was really the SP//dr pilot. Peni ignores her, but Addy retorts by saying she is not as special as she thinks. At home, Peni tries to talk to Ben and May about being special, but she gets ignored. While improving the SP//dr's web shooters, she notices Addy walking in the base and follows her; only to find another mech-suit similar to the SP//dr, only in black and powered by a sym-engine called VEN#m, with Addy as its pilot. Peni becomes furious at her aunt and uncle for not telling her about this. When a kaiju-like creature named M.O.R.B.I.U.S. starts to drain the city's electrical energy, SP//dr goes after it, but is quickly defeated. In order to defeat M.O.R.B.I.U.S., Peni's aunt and uncle send VEN#m to defeat the creature. It is successful, but the creature causes VEN#m to malfunction; causing the mech suit to attain sentience and consume Addy. When May flies in to fix the problem manually, it consumes her as well. SP//dr confronts VEN#m, but the black mech suit overpowers her until she uses her improved web shooters to defeat it. However, she is too late to save her Aunt May and Addy, who have vanished from inside the suit. Following the battle, Peni and Ben have a heart to heart, but Spider-Ham re-appears to recruit Peni to help defeat the Inheritors once more during the events of Spider-Geddon.

It was built from 1854 to 1855. It is also known as Cornish Roasting Pits. The property is owned by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Hill End Quartz Roasting Pits Complex was established by the Colonial Gold Mining Company in 1855, on the traditional land of the Wiradjuri people, to provide gold extraction facilities for those working claims on the Tambaroora and Hill End goldfields. Although at this time alluvial mining was the primary method of gold recovery, the Tambaroora fields also supported the earliest attempts at reef mining in Australia, over fifteen years before the reef mining boom of the 1870s. The Quartz Roasting Pits Complex is one of the oldest goldrush sites in Australia and represents one of the first attempts to process gold bearing ore. It also represents an unusual technological solution to the problems initially experienced in extracting payable gold from the quartz reefs, in its development of the earliest form of quartz firing technology in Australia. With kilns for roasting gold bearing quartz, a sophisticated battery and dam system for crushing and washing the ore and houses for workers, the Complex provides tangible evidence of technological, social and domestic relationships during this very early stage of Australia's goldmining history. Gold bearing quartz was brought to the Complex from surrounding mines and roasted to make it easier to crush (a relatively unusual process) and then crushed in a steam powered battery. Gold was then extracted from the powdered ore through a process of sieving and washing. Despite its impressive technological achievements, the operation, managed and probably designed by Alfred Spence, was short-lived, closing in 1856, only eighteen months after it opened. This may have been partly due to the fact that the primitive roasting techniques employed hampered the gold extraction process. It may also have been due to the lack of gold in the reefs of the surrounding area, which were not fully tested before the Complex was established. Since 1856, no major development has occurred on the site with the land being used for grazing, as part of Alpha Station. Ownership was transferred to National Parks and Wildlife in 1967. Limited archaeological excavations were undertaken by the University of Sydney in 1975 and partial reconstruction of the battery and roasting pits in 1977. Following the reassessment of the site in April 1997, the site is being stabilised and new interpretative signage prepared for its presentation to the public.  Description  The Roasting Pits Complex is located approximately 10 km north of Hill End township and approximately 2.5 km north of Valentine's Mine which acted as the main source of auriferous quartz. It sits within a small gently sloping valley, straddling a shallow watercourse. The site comprises a pair of kilns, a battery building which housed ore crushing machinery, a dam and the remains of two houses where the manager and various workers lived while the site was in operation. The Battery and Roasting Pits form the visual focus of the site, as they would have in the 1850s. From this point, all the other structures with the exception of the Dam, are largely obscured by vegetation. When the site was in operation however, the landscape would have been barren, with a clear view of mining activities in the surrounding hills. This harsh cultural landscape is still evident on close examination although its general sense has been diminished somewhat by the later plant growth. It is likely, given the short history of the Complex's operation, that all of the substantial structures on the site were built at about the same time in 1855. They would have suffered some impact upon the closure of the operation as equipment was salvaged, scavenged and removed from the site. Apart from grazing and cultivation, no significant later use of the site is known. The Roasting Pits are a two chamber kiln structure set on the hill upslope of the Battery. The Pits are composed of hard sedimentary stone, predominantly metamorphosed shale and greywacke. The kiln contains two conical pits that open from the top and taper sharply to ground level at the front (downslope). Each pit is built in front of an artificial embankment that joins the hill contour but drops sharply on both sides.Roasting pits The Battery sits on the valley floor about 20m below the Roasting Pits. It was here that the ore was crushed after roasting. The placement of the Battery on Fighting Ground Creek provided an area for tailings run off and access to a ready supply of water which was fed from the Dam further upstream. Locating it directly below the Roasting Pits also assisted the movement of the roasted ore from one stage of the extraction process to the next. The Battery is a large structure containing two main spaces and a solid stone platform containing several voids or spaces for machinery. It is oriented approximately north- south along its long axis, roughly parallel to the creek bank and across the slope leading down from the Roasting Pits. The western side of the building is cut into the slope, while the eastern is built onto the flat creek terrace.Battery plant ruins Other features are scattered throughout the surrounding bush including house remains and a large earth dam to the north- east of the battery. The site was reported to have high archaeological potential as at 29 August 1997. The ruins retain their integrity.  Heritage listing  The Hill End Quartz Roasting Pits is nationally significant as one of the earliest surviving reasonably intact gold mining related sites in Australia. The site demonstrates the operations of an uncommon technology brought to Australia to deal with the intractable quartz being mined. As an industrial site all facets of the processes that took place and the infrastructure associated with it are still represented. The site provides an understanding of the nature of capital investment, technological transfer and mining and extractive processes at the very start of the gold boom, which was itself a process of lasting importance for Australia. The Roasting Pits are nationally significant as a rare example of the application of a common design for lime burning being adapted for the roasting of quartz. They reflect the period prior to the development of specialised quartz roasting kilns. The Battery is nationally significant as a purpose-built structure to house a boiler, beam engine and stamper battery. It represents the oldest surviving stamper battery building erected for gold mining in Australia, being substantially intact and interpretable as a working structure. The features associated with the Roasting Pits, such as the Dam, and worker housing are also nationally significant by enhancing the understanding of the infrastructure associated with the operation of the Roasting Pits. The remains of the fences associated with the 1871 occupation of the site are regionally significant. Quartz Roasting Pits Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Hill End Quartz Roasting Pits are of national historical importance for their role in demonstrating the initial stage of the gold rushes that transformed the nineteenth century Australian economy. They represent an investment of capital and a transfer and application of technology from overseas that is both representative of the processes of the early gold rush period and unusual for its particular form of application. They are an evocative and extremely early representation of the capital-driven reef mining activity that was not to develop a major presence in Hill End until the early 1870s. The nature and pattern of technological transfer and experimentation during the early gold rush period can be understood by historical analysis of the site. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The setting for the Roasting Pits is aesthetically pleasing as a pastoral landscape, typical of the mix of small farms, cleared pastoral land and variously aged forest regrowth. The appearance of the Battery, the Roasting Pits and the other cultural features within the complex is evocative of the romance of the historical period of gold mining. It does not reflect the reality, but there is a subliminal juxtaposition of the passivity of the natural setting and the implied violence and chaos of the industrial processes. The Roasting Pits and the Battery were carefully designed functional structures. It is evident that both were built to prepared designs, and that they were meant to operate closely together as a single functional unit. The design of the Roasting Pits reflects the utilisation, with minimal adaptation, of a standard design for lime kilns. This design, as shown by numerous examples, was commonplace and well- understood. It is rare as an example of the design used for quartz roasting. This type of design was superseded within a decade by more sophisticated designs, such as Wilkinson's in Victoria. The Battery, as a free-standing industrial building housing a stamper battery, would have been one of the first of its type in Australia. It was also a variation on a type that had a lengthy history in British usage, especially in mining areas such as Cornwall. It was an integration of architectural design and engineering function to create an optimal structure for a specific purpose. As stampers became more common they were housed in expedient structures which lacked the care for masonry construction evident in the Battery. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Quartz Roasting Pits Complex represent an early stage of the development of the association that Hill End and Tambaroora had with gold. The link has been strengthened through the management of Hill End by NPWS since 1967 as an exemplar of nineteenth century gold mining landscapes and townscapes and has significance to the current local community. The living history of the area still plays a vital role in day to day life. The Complex's social significance is no greater than the remainder of the recognised historic heritage around Hill End. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The technological significance of the Quartz Roasting Pits rests on the rarity of their technology. The use of roasting, while not unknown in Australia, was rare. It reflects the first decade of gold mining in Australia, where lack of knowledge of the material was matched with a poverty of suitable equipment. The technological interest in the site is also enhanced by its integrity. The main features of the entire industrial complex are present in forms that can be interpreted and understood in relation to one another. It is representative of technology transfer - both as human systems (the Cornish bringing technology and designs into the colony for mining) and as machines (English capital, English and colonial kiln designs, American stampers and gold extracting technology). There are gaps in our knowledge of the layout and design of the complex, its corporate history, the details of its operation and its success which are able to be investigated by archaeology and no other source. The rarity of this type of site in intactness from the first phase of goldmining, and of that type of technology guarantees that it will not be represented effectively on many sites at all in Australia. Many sites of the first decade of the gold rushes have been destroyed by reinvestigation or different mining techniques. Sites of this period are inherently rare due to their vulnerability. The Quartz Roasting Pits complex can shed more light through archaeological investigation on itself, upon the processes of technological transfer and adaptation of technology in the period of gold mining commencing in Australia. As a largely intact site it has the potential to reveal the social relationships between different levels in the mining hierarchy, and the interrelationships between human and technological systems. An inquiry could investigate the investment capital used to create the complex and how this was reflected in the material culture of those who worked there. This can be contrasted to those of others who worked for themselves on the gold fields. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Quartz Roasting Pits Complex is extremely rare in its technicl/research and historic significance  See also   References  = Bibliography = = Attribution = Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Hill End, New South Wales Category:Industrial buildings in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Kilns ","title":"Quartz Roasting Pits Complex"},{"id":"57955539","text":"Marko Zeljug (; born 1983) is a politician in Serbia.

George and Henry Cox, sons of William Cox, were the first settlers on the Cudgegong River when they established the Menah run, 3 kilometres north of the current town. The European settlers were soon in conflict with the Wiradjuri over a range of issues including killing of livestock and animals such as kangaroos and possums which were major food sources for the indigenous people. Martial law was declared in 1824 leading to significant losses by the Wiradjuri. While the site of Mudgee was surveyed for a village in 1823, Menah was the original settlement having a police station and a lock-up by 1833. Robert Hoddle designed the village which was gazetted in 1838. John Blackman built a slab hut, the first dwelling in Mudgee and its general store. By 1841, there were 36 dwellings, three hotels, a hospital, a post office, two stores and an Anglican church. An Anglican school was established in that decade as well. In 1851, the population of Mudgee was 200. However, the population soon exploded with the discovery of gold in New South Wales. While no gold was found in Mudgee itself, the town prospered as gold was discovered in nearby Hargraves, Gulgong, Hill End and Windeyer, some temporarily reaching populations of 20,000. . . As the gold mines petered out in the latter half of the 19th century, Mudgee was sustained by the strength of its wool industry as well as the nascent wine industry established by a German immigrant, Adam Roth, in the 1850s. ;Family ownership of Binnawee farm Henry Cox was the son of William Cox, who was responsible for the construction on the first road across the Blue Mountains. Henry Cox became the first grantee of the land now known as Binnawee, bought at a cost of 244 pounds and registered in 1834. This grant adjoined further of his crown grants to the east and to the north. In 1852 Henry Cox sold the Cullenbone property, including Binnawee, to William Lewis, whose father Richard Lewis had worked with Henyr's father on the road construction project as Chief Superintendent. Throughout the 1850s Lewis took up several runs on the Castlereagh River. Perhaps buoyed by his prosperity, Lewis is believed to have built the Georgian two-storey homestead which was initially called \\"LoisAlle\\". By 1862 Lewis was insolvent and all of his real estate interests seized and sold. \\"LoisAlle\\" was purchased by the Blackmen brothers of Mudgee, cousins of Lewis' wife. William Richard and Samuel Alfred Blackman, sons of Mudgee pioneers, William and Sarah Blackman, became prominent landowners in the Mudgee district. In 1869 William bought out Samuel's share in the property and lived there during the 1870s, occasionally leasing the house and portions of adjoining land. In 1878 Blackman sold the property to George Henry Cox of Burrundulla, a prominent pastoralist in Mudgee (and nephew of the original grantee - he was also Henry Cox's son-in-law since he had married his cousin Henrietta). George Henry Cox absorbed the property into his adjoining landholding known as Piambong and the house and lands were leased. From 1883-86 the house was occupied by George Henry Cox's eldest son, George Henry Frederick Cox. In the late 1890s the house was occupied by John Turner McRae, a nephew by marriage and manager of Piambong. Legal documentation in 1898 refers to him as John Turner McRae as of \\"Binnawee\\", although it is not known precisely when or by whom the property was given this name. Shortly before his death in 1901, George Henry Cox transferred the property to his son-in-law George Stewart. In 1900 the widower Stewart and his four children took up residence at Binnawee where he was assisted by his sisters-in-law, Lucy and Alice Cox. Referred to as the \\"squire of Binnawee\\" George played a prominent role in the political, commercial and social life of the Mudgee district. He was an alderman of the Municipality of Cudgegong for twenty-one years, including four years as mayor from 1905 to 1908, and also served as a Justice of the Peace, coroner and magistrate. He was also a pillar of Mudgee's Saint John's Anglican Church. In 1923 Stewart leased Binnawee to Dr Charles Lester and his son, Bruce, and moved to Sydney where he died in 1926. Charles Lester was born in Mudgee in 1865, and graduated from medical studies at the University of Edinburgh in 1888. He married Mary Bruce before returning to Mudgee to establish his medical practice in the early 1890s. Also a qualified pharmacist, Charles operated his medical practice and pharmacy in premises in Church Street, Mudgee, later known as Mercer's and Gawthorne's Pharmacy. Charles left Mudgee and established a practice in Macquarie Street in 1924. Bruce Lester, also a qualified pharmacist, was a member of the 6th Light Horse Division during World War I, serving for four years in the Middle East. In 1920 he selected Kobi, a block of 225 acres adjacent to Binnawee, which was formerly part of an 1823 grant to Captain Henry Steel. In 1923 Bruce married Mabel Hume, by whom he had one son, David. Bruce and Mabel Lester lived at Binnawee which was run primarily as a sheep property with some cattle. Charles and Bruce Lester also bred racehorses, while Bruce was a competent amateur jockey, frequently riding in the Bligh Picnic Races. In 1944 Bruce Lester became ill and, as there was a shortage of manpower due to the war, 16-year-old son David took over the management of the property. In 1948 Bruce Lester purchased the Binnawee homestead portion from George Stewart's trustees and the property was eventually expanded to some . In 1950 David married Mary Grant and built a new homestead on Binnawee in 1955. Gradually reduced to over the years, Binnawee retains some sheep and cattle. In partnership with their daughters - Elizabeth Ganguly, Anne Lofts, and Robyn Holdaway - David and Mary have recently planted olive groves. ;Architectural context of house and homestead The historic Binnawee Homestead building is the earliest surviving two-storeyed house in the Mudgee district: Burrandulla homestead was constructed in 1864 and Havilah homestead in 1872. Bleak House in Lawson Street, Mudgee dates from 1860.  Description  One of the outbuildings Binnawee Homestead is located on part of a crown grant of on Macdonald's Creek at Cullenbone, several kilometres north-west of Mudgee, across the Parishes of Munna and Piambong in the County of Wellington. Although the property is operated as a working farm, the curtilage of this listing closely surrounds the group of mid-19th century buildings, of which the focal point is the historic Binnawee Homestead. ;Homestead Thought to have been constructed , the homestead building is substantial but unpretentious. Its Georgian style owes much to earlier Australian vernacular design and it was most likely designed by the builder or copied from a pattern book. Facing south-east with front and rear elevations of five bays, the house is a compact rectangle with a deceptively asymmetrical exterior. The fenestration of the front elevation is balanced, but at the rear the windows on both the lower and upper levels are irregularly placed to accommodate the off-centre stair. Consequently, the two rooms on the south-western corner on both the ground and first floors are relatively small. The light red bricks are, for the most part, in good condition. The south-eastern elevation is in Flemish bond, while the rear and two sides are in colonial or garden wall bond. All windows and doors feature flat gauged arches with tuck pointing. The steeply pitched hipped roof, which retains the original shingles under the unpainted corrugated iron, is pierced by two tall, corbelled brick chimneys servicing five fireplaces. A timber-floored verandah, deep, surrounds the ground floor, while its concave profile roof is supported by flat, stop-chamfered timber columns. On the ground floor of the front elevation two sets of shuttered French doors flank each side of the central front door. All windows are six- pane sashes and featured shutters, although the windows at the front are slightly larger than those on the rear and sides. Many windows retain the original glazing and feature the remains of stencilled floral patterns. The impressive double front doors, capped by a three-paned stencilled fanlight are painted red on the exterior. Each door features a single panel with heavy bolection mouldings and a semi-circular headed top. Stained and lacquered on the interior, each door has two panels with a semi-circular headed top on the upper panel. Both the front and rear doors have substantial drawback rimlocks. Although the house is relatively small there is a distinction between the principal rooms at the front and secondary rooms at the rear on both floors. Although the skirtings are a standard size throughout, architraves and doors are smaller in the four rear rooms. Ceiling height is a uniform metres. Downstairs, the front rooms were used by the Lesters as a dining room and a living room, although previously the living room had been the principal bedroom. The dining room features an elaborate wallpaper and frieze, while the substantial cornice in the dining room, picked out in several tones, is possibly a later installation. The study and the breakfast room occupy the two smaller rooms at the rear, with the breakfast room featuring a particularly fine Edwardian frieze of alpine scenery. The stair is narrow and steep, starting in a spiral ninety-degree turn, with a straight flight to a landing and a short return flight to the upper landing. The squared balusters, handrail and turned newels are typical of a mid-Victorian stair. The fretwork on the side of the steps and the panelling underneath the stair are the only two instances of ornamentation in what is a relatively austere interior. Of the four rooms upstairs, the bedroom in the eastern corner, over the living room, is the largest room in the house and was originally the upstairs parlour. With windows facing the south-east and north-east, this room is well lit and has expansive views. Bruce and Mabel Lester created a small lobby on the south-western end of this room by erecting a partition wall, so as to give greater privacy to the two front rooms. The joinery throughout is lacquered cedar but regrettably all five of the classical yet sober mantelpieces have been painted. The mantelpieces upstairs are smaller and vary slightly from their downstairs counterparts. All walls and even some ceilings are papered and reflect a variety of periods; several layers of paper can be discerned on some walls. Ceilings are mostly square-set, with only the hallway and dining room featuring cornices. Floor coverings consist of bare boards and rugs of varying sizes, while some stunning linos with intricate geometric patterns remain in place in several rooms. Binnawee was allegedly the second house in the Mudgee district to have electric lighting and several rooms retain the original pull-cords. An American Delco 32 volt generator was installed by the Lesters in 1923 and it is still housed in a building adjacent to the house. In 1967 Binnawee homestead received a National Trust \\"B\\" classification, and under the current system holds a \\"recorded\\" listing. It was also on the former Register of the National Estate. ;Kitchen block A walkway, covered in semi- circular corrugated iron, leads from the rear verandah of the homestead to the kitchen block several metres away. Believed to have been the original homestead, the kitchen block is built in brick in Flemish garden wall bond, and contains two rooms under a gabled roof with two small rooms under a skillion section at the rear. As none of the rooms have ceilings, the original shingles are still clearly visible under the corrugated iron roof. Of particular interest is the door opening from the covered way into the kitchen. It was once a tradition, begun in the time of the Stewarts, for visitors who spent more than a week at Binnawee to carve their initials into the door; consequently, there are hundreds of initials, with, no doubt, many associated stories. This building was badly damaged by storms in 2001. The roof, timber structures and a large quantity of its soft brick walls are missing. While it would be desirable to reconstruct these missing elements to protect the remains, such a reconstructed building would have a high ratio of new fabric. Meanwhile, the kitchen building is considered to be a ruin, and not subject to the Minimum Standards of Maintenance and Repair The kitchen building should be managed so that its decay is retarded. ;Workshop Located several metres to the north-east of the house is a building of random rubble construction which is uncharacteristic of the rest of the buildings in the homestead complex. Used as a dairy and later as a workshop by the Lesters, it was built as a conservatory in the early 1900s by George Stewart's sisters-in-law, Lucy and Alice Cox, who lived at Binnawee with the Stewart family. The clay for the bricks and the stone for the rubble workshop were probably sourced from the property. ;Stables The stables are located two hundred metres to the north- west of the rear of the house. The original gabled brick section with a loft is constructed in Flemish garden wall bond and is presumed to be contemporary with the kitchen block. The building has been expanded at various times with drop slab additions. The roof, originally shingled, is mostly corrugated iron sheeting, while some sections retain flat galvanised iron tiles. ;Workman's cottage Several metres south of the stables is a small gabled workman's cottage, constructed in non-reinforced concrete and rendered in ashlar, which dates from . The workman's cottage, and early concrete structure, has survived remarkably well. ;Shearing shed The rambling shearing shed, west of the house, is considerably ancient in parts. Partly clad in timber and corrugated iron and constructed in several stages, it has been extended by both Bruce and David Lester. ;Well A 19th century well survives intact adjacent to the creek below the homestead. ;Dog kennels, formerly stables Low or intrusive significance. ;Machinery shed Low or intrusive significance. = Condition = The homestead has not been occupied since 1970 and has endured some storm damage to first floor windows. In a poor to fair condition, the homestead requires urgent attention before further deterioration occurs. The detached kitchen block is in a poor condition, having been substantially damaged during storms in 2001. The stables and shearing shed are in fair condition, but the stables require some structural work; both buildings remain in regular use. The workshop and the workman's cottage are both in poor condition and require structural work. As there has been a continual European presence on the property since the early days of European settlement in the Mudgee district, the environs of the homestead and outbuildings would have considerable archaeological potential. The homestead especially has retained its integrity since construction and the majority of the homestead's outbuildings remain relatively untouched. The kitchen block, which was probably the original homestead building, was badly damaged by storms in 2001 and requires urgent repairs and conservation work. = Modifications and dates = The homestead remains virtually intact since its construction (estimate Phillip Cox/Howard Tanner). A detached weatherboard bathroom was added to a side verandah in the 1920s and is non-intrusive. Modifications on the interior include the installation of a 32 volt electric lighting system in 1923, the installation of a partition wall upstairs in the 1930s (easily removed) and the replacement of a lath and plaster ceiling by a timber-lined ceiling in the early 1900s in the living room; the dining room cornice may have been a later installation. All outbuildings, except for the kitchen, are relatively intact. The stables have received slab additions on two sides, and the shearing shed, which has been expanded and renovated from time to time.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Binnawee Homestead and Outbuildings are of State significance as a picturesquely diverse yet cohesive group of mid-nineteenth century rural buildings. This group is representative of the pastoral history of the State, providing evidence of the aspirations and wealth of mid-nineteenth century graziers, while being rare in its intactness. The homestead building is a fine and rare example of an intact mid 19th century, Georgian two-storey house, while the working outbuildings include stables, shearing shed and working man's cottage and are constructed in a variety of materials, including brick, clay rubble, slab and reinforced concrete. The Binnawee Homestead and Outbuildings are of State significance for their research potential in providing information about mid-nineteenth century building materials and techniques. Also, because the farm has been in constant habitation and use since the early nineteenth century, there is archaeological potential. The homestead especially has retained its integrity since construction while the majority of the homestead's outbuildings remain relatively untouched. The Binnawee Homestead and Outbuildings are considered to be of local significance for having been owned and/or occupied by many people prominent in local and/ or State affairs. William Lewis, the Blackman brothers, Charles Lester, Bruce Lester and David Lester are prominent local identities. Henry Cox is widely known as a pioneer of Mulgoa and Mudgee, while George Henry Cox, MLA and MLC, was a prominent grazier and one of the longest-serving parliamentarians in NSW history. The Binnawee Homestead and Outbuildings are of social significance to the local Mudgee community as an intact representative of a pioneering farming settlement in the district and a fine early group of buildings. The homestead is the earliest surviving two-storeyed residence in the district and the only one with distinctly Georgian origins. Binnawee Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of State significance as a remarkably intact grouping of mid-nineteenth century rural buildings that represent the pastoral history of the State and evidence the aspirations, rise and wealth of mid- nineteenth century graziers. The homestead, dated c.1855, is also of local significance as the earliest surviving two-storeyed house in the Mudgee district. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of local significance for having been owned and/or occupied by many people prominent in local and/ or State affairs. William Lewis, the Blackman brothers, Charles Lester, Bruce Lester and David Lester are prominent local identities. Henry Cox is more widely known as a pioneer of Mulgoa and Mudgee, while George Henry Cox, MLA and MLC, was a prominent grazier and one of the longest serving parliamentarians in NSW history. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of State aesthetic significance firstly for the homestead building which is a fine and rare example of a mid 19th century, Georgian two-storey house which is remarkably intact in its architectural design and form. Although based on a standard pattern book design, the symmetrical and asymmetrical attributes of the Homestead are aesthetically pleasing. Secondly, in the immediate vicinity of the homestead there is an intact collection of farming outbuildings constructed in a variety of materials, including brick, clay rubble, slab and reinforced concrete, and which make a picturesquely diverse yet cohesive group of rural buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of local social significance to the Mudgee community as an intact representative of a pioneering farming settlement in the district. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of State significance for their research potential in providing information about mid-nineteenth century building materials and techniques. The relationship of the homestead complex to the nearby Macdonald's Creek - the source of much of its water - may also be a source of research potential. Also, because the farm has been in constant habitation and use since the early nineteenth century, there is high archaeological potential on the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Binnawee homestead building is of State significance for its rarity as a virtually intact, in situ homestead building from the mid-1850s. Its rarity is enhanced by the survival of its accompanying group of working buildings, including stables, shearing shed and working man's cottage, some of which are still in use. It is of local significance for having few equivalents in building medium or style in the greater Central West region. It is the only house in the district to have distinctly Georgian origins. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Binnawee Homestead and outbuildings are of State significance as highly representative of the pastoral history of the district and state and the aspirations, rise and wealth of the early graziers.

Originally constructed as a school in 1895, over the years it has also served as a hotel and a private home. It is currently used as a multi-tenant office building. It was entered into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on November 15, 1978. History The Seminary was constructed in 1895. Benjamin Franklin George had donated land for the creation of a school for Lithonia, in part to educate his own children. Lithonia had no public school system at the time; The Seminary was one of three schools which were privately owned and supported by tuition. The building was constructed of granite, using stone quarried locally. The town derived its name and much of its economy from granite at this time. The building is two stories with walls made of 19 to 24 inch granite and has a hip roof. The first floor has 12 foot ceilings and the second floor has 16 foot ceilings. By 1906 a public school system had been established in Lithonia, so the school was closed and the building sold to John Keay Davidson Sr. He was a Scottish immigrant who founded a quarrying company in Lithonia in 1901. Davidson brought in skilled stonemasons from Scotland as workers, and converted the building into the Auto Rest Hotel to house them. It was at this time that the double veranda at the front of the structure was added. The hotel continued in operation until 1917. In 1917 the building was sold to J.H. Malone, who added interior plumbing and electricity to use the building as a private home. It was around this time a two-story bathroom addition was made at the rear center of the house. A second bathroom addition was made in 1962 at the rear north corner of the house. The house remained in the Malone family for many years. In 2007 the house was sold to Ellen King Stewart, daughter in law of one of the original students of the Seminary, Dr. Thomas Weir Stewart. The building was restored and redeveloped by Mrs. Stewart as a multi-tenant office building called the Academy Professional Building.

It was designed by John Whitton and built from 1883 to 1884. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Mudgee residents made representations during the planning of the Great Western Railway to have the line built from Newcastle to Singleton and on to Mudgee. Bathurst, however, was successful in having the line extended from Penrith, which was completed in 1876. The residents of Mudgee continued to lobby for their own line and formed a committee in 1870 to advance their cause. In 1873 the Government of New South Wales proposed a line between Kelso and Mudgee, but when nothing happened, residents formed the Mudgee Railway league in 1875. Small progress was made in 1876, when a survey was undertaken, but work did not progress until 1879 when Parliament voted for the construction of a line between Wallerwang and Mudgee. This bill was mainly due to the efforts of Sir John Robertson, member for Mudgee and Chairman of the Mudgee Railway League. Sir John was honoured for his efforts, turning the first sod for the line on 23 September 1880. The line, however, was not officially opened until 11 September 1884. Extravagant celebrations marked the opening of the line, beginning with the arrival of the decorated mail train on the morning of the 10 September. This was followed by a picnic at Market Square, now Robertson Park. The official opening followed on the 11th with a procession of bands through the streets to the station where the ministerial train broke the ribbon. Celebrations continued at Market Square with an outdoor feast and a banquet and ball in the evening. Sheedy (1988:15) states that the opening of the railway \\"was the climax of one of the greatest days in the history of Mudgee and saw the realization of nearly 25 years hard and persistent representation by the citizens for \\"their\\" railway.\\" The station building was designed by John Whitton, Engineer and built according to his plan. Whitton seems to have realised the importance of the railway to people of Mudgee and created a building in scale and grandeur that was only surpassed by the Devonshire Street Terminus and the station buildings in Newcastle, Albury and Hay. The yard layout has not altered greatly since 1883, although the Station Master's Residence, Railway Institute, Signal's and Examiner's Cabins and Garages have been demolished. Passenger train services to Mudgee ceased in 1985. The station building was used for some years as FreightCorp and Pacific National accommodation and leased by community groups. Much of the interior of the building was converted into a restaurant in 2005, with alterations to the general waiting room, entrance/lobby and booking office, the installation of kitchen facilities and temporary fencing on the station platform. The restaurant opened in February 2006. It was later replaced by an Indian restaurant; however, this ceased operation 2015. It is now used by the Mandurah Studio Craft Co-operative, the Arts and Crafts Mudgee gallery and as a veterans' drop-in centre run by the Mudgee sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association.  Description  ;Yard The yard runs east-west in an elongated form matching the railway line. It terminates at the eastern end with a concrete overbridge. To the west of the station building is the foot warming furnace and coal bins, which have been roofed. The Station is surrounded by a gravelled parking area and nature strip to the north, by the goods yard to the east, which includes the dock, crane, weighbridge and office. Further east is the Engine Running Shed and associated buildings. A range of residences and the Barracks line Inglis Street. To the south of the Station, and across the tracks, is a park-like area leased to the Mudgee Base Hospital. ;Station Building The Station is a break fronted building of red brick with sandstone foundations and quoins. A massing of roof structure in the centre of the building provides a focus, being decorated with cast iron finials and crestings. A date plaque sits underneath this central moulded pediment. The roof is hipped corrugated iron with ridge vents and is also broken by elaborately moulded chimneys. A band of painted renderwork decorates the exterior at cornice level. Wings at either end of the building form the termination of the cast iron verandah on the Inglis Street face, while facing the tracks an elaborate awning runs the length of the building. Pavilions at either end of the Station were once free standing, but have been linked by later infill. Internally, a sense of space is created by the use of high ceilings. The walls are plastered and many rooms retain their hardwood floors. Externally the windows and fanlights have arched heads, but internally are finished horizontally with squared architraves. One room appears to have retained its original chimney piece, but all other fixtures have been removed. ;List of associated buildings and structures: Western Area * Foot warmer furnace and coal bins * Church Street overbridge * Former Church Street Gatehouse (1883), 162 Church Street (not in SHR curtilage?)

Heritage listing  Mudgee station and yard group is one of the best surviving Victorian station and yard groups in which most of the components are intact with major structures surviving from the time of opening and from early in the 1900s. It exhibits the confidence in railway construction in the 1880s and the continuation of that confidence by the quality of the extensions to the station building in 1913 when most railway buildings were standardised and of cheaper construction. It is one of the very few similar buildings to survive without exterior masonry being painted. The station building, although added to, retains its early form and is a major civic building in Mudgee. It marks an important phase in railway construction at the end of the boom period, following the goldrushes to western NSW. Mudgee railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Mudgee Railway Station is of State significance as a fine example of a Victorian boom style railway station. The Railway Station is of local significance as a town landmark. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Mudgee Railway Station and yard are of State significance as a rare surviving example of original railway line and siding arrangements. The Railway Station is rare in the degree and extent to which it retains its original fabric and character. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Mudgee Railway Station and yard are of State significance as being representative of large country railway stations erected in the late Victorian period. It is a fine example of its type due to its integrity and the retention of original fabric, particularly in relation to the layout of the rails and sidings.

Mangham and Matilda Dandridge Grant Mangham. Thomas was the first clerk of Stewart County, Georgia, at the time of its creation. He later moved to Russell County Alabama, where he found great success as a planter and land speculator. His home and property however was destroyed by Native Americans who lived near the father Mangham's new home. Thomas died in 1861. Wiley P. Mangham was educated in the Baptist High School in Jacksonville, Alabama. The Mangham family were strict Baptists in their religious beliefs. Wiley Mangham enlisted with the Confederacy once the Civil War was underway, and was promoted to the level of drill instructor with the 25th Alabama Infantry, until he was urged to resign due to poor health. =Marriage and moving= At the close of the war, Mangham married Caroline Frances Emaline \\"Fannie\\" Lynn and in 1866, he would come to Louisiana to visit his brother, Henry G.

That same year, the new parish of Richland was created by the Louisiana State Legislature, and Mangham sensed an opportunity for potentially good business ventures. At this time, the town of Rayville was little more than a small courthouse. Mangham purchased land adjacent to the courthouse, and ordered a Washington Hand Press. On January 14, 1869, the first edition of the Richland Beacon News went up for sale. An annual subscription could be purchased for $3.00, but Mangham kindly requested that payment be made up front. Mangham eventually acquired additional land throughout the parish over the next several years, and eventually he would sell a portion of his land to the railroad company which would enable a new town to be formed, 12 miles south of Rayville. The founders of that town honored Wiley P. Mangham by naming the new town after him, and this town is still known today as Mangham, Louisiana. The streets in Mangham were named after Wiley P.'s children. Philosophical and/or political views Mangham was a staunch Democrat, and served as the chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee for Richland Parish at times, and remained very active politically in opposition to the reconstruction politics that followed the close of the Civil War. Mangham penned numerous editorials over the course of his being the publisher and editor of the Richland Beacon. Mangham and his wife were both active members of the Baptist church, and he and his wife Fannie helped start the First Baptist Church of Rayville, where the original members met at their home before a church building was constructed. Mangham also was a member of the Masonic fraternity and the Knights of Pythias.  Death and legacy  Welcome sign to town of Mangham, La In 1896, Wiley P.

It was built from 1860 to 1870. It is also known as Bridge Hotel, Rylstone Historical Society Building and Bridgeview Inn. The property is owned by Rylstone and District Historical Society. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In the early 1860s Goodwin Squires Hall and his family arrived in Rylstone, having previously spent some time on the Turon River goldfields near Sofala.Aitken CMP, 2003 Goodwin Spires Hall was an emancipist who had been transported in to NSW as a convict in1836 for manslaughter.Hollister, 2013 He acquired land at the northern end off Louee Street where he built a number of cottages and a general store. The area became known as Halls Corner and two of his early Victorian cottages remain. His son later operated a newsagency, a fancy goods store and boot business in the corner buildings. The building of the Bridge Hotel (as it was first known) in the late 1860s, on land south of the cottages, was one of Hall's major projects and although the architect and builder are not known it is possible that Purvis may have been involved. Purvis was an experienced stonemason in the town and had constructed a number of well-executed buildings in and around Rylstone at the time (such as the Dabee and Carwell homesteads) and also later the fine three storey sandstone mill in Louee Street opposite the Bridge Inn. Apparently the inn was so named because it faced the road bridge over the Cudgegong River at the end of Hall Street (the White Bridge, the second of four road bridges built in Rylstone). The Bridgeview was one of four inns in the late 1860s in Rylstone; these were Walton's Colonial Inn (the oldest and formerly opposite the post office), Mr Hayes' The Shamrock (formerly at the lower end of Mudgee Street), Mr Owens' The Globe (south of the Bridge Hotel in Louee Street) and Hall's Bridge Hotel. Hall leased the business to various operators (Muir, Owen, Brown, Stollery and Crosley) from 1872 until the license lapsed in 1895. When it closed as a hotel it was purchased by the Australian Joint Stock Bank. The bank had operated from a small premises in Jackson's Building to the south in Louee Street since the early 1870s. The two rooms at the northern end of the building, formerly the bar, became the business office with the manager's office at the back. The rest of the ground floor and the entire upstairs areas were used as the manager's residence. The AJS Bank changed its name to the Australian Bank of Commerce in 1910 and subsequently amalgamated with the Bank of New South Wales in November 1931. At this time alterations were made to the southern end of the upstairs area. In 1950 the bank manager moved to a residence in Mudgee Street and the clerk occupied the office residence. In 1957 when the new bank building in Louee Street was completed and a clerk's residence built beside the manager's, the Bridgeview Inn became vacant and was put up for sale. Alterations were made to the timber verandah posts and fencing which had remained intact when the street level had been lowered some years before. The new owner was the Kandos Cement Works' accountant, Mr Fink. He intended to reside there upon his retirement from the works. However his plans were never realised due to his premature death. The building was leased to the Rylstone Historical Society and they sub-let the upper residence retaining only the two downstairs rooms, the dining room and the early separate kitchen at the rear. The local solicitor John Knox used the office and residence for a time until his own home was built and subsequently retained the office. After the death of Mr Fink the building was again put up for sale and as there were concerns about its future the Society secured a housing loan and purchased the property in 1967. In 1978 the building was used as the set for the significant Australian film of Thomas Keneally's book \\"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith\\" and directed by Fred Schepisi. The bar in particular was \\"restored\\" for this production. In 1981 further conservation of the building was assisted by two grants from the National Estate Program additionally a loan was granted to the lessee to assist in the establishment of a business. As one of the conditions of the loan a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the building in 1986 following a recommendation of the NSW Heritage Council. The PCO listing was transformed into a State Heritage Register listing on 2 April 1999. An historic mural was uncovered in the dining room in the 1980s, which was further investigated and conserved by the historical society from 2010 Over the years the society tried to establish a number of restaurant ventures with different tenants in an effort to recoup maintenance costs with varying degrees of success. In 1988 the society relocated the Showground cottage that been threatened with demolition to make way for a new amenities building. The early 20th century weatherboard cottage was originally a four-roomed building with timber verandah. Since the inn had been let in the restaurant venture the cottage provided avenue for meetings, display space and storage of furniture. In 2018 the Bridgeview Inn is used for tourism purposes, with various local businesses leasing parts of the building offering accommodation, food and shopping.  Description  The Bridgeview Inn is one of several stone buildings which together give Rylstone much of its aesthetic appeal. It is an important townscape element. The building, dating from the 1860s, is double storey and with a steep, hipped iron roof, constructed of stone - dressed sandstone to the facade and random rubble to the other walls. There is a two- storey verandah facing Louee Street. This has timber posts, with mouldings, and lattice infill to the archways between the posts; the upper balustrade is cross braced. Windows are twelve pane and have shutters. A skillion section runs along the rear of the building. The interior includes high-ceilinged rooms and several narrow hallways with steep stairways and cedar joinery. The Dining Room contains the rare 1860s mural that has recently been uncovered and conserved. Behind the inn building is a small detached rubble-stone building made partly of stone and partly of sandstock brick which was probably the original kitchen. There are recently built public toilets at the northern end of this outbuilding. There is the early 20th century weatherboard \\"Showground cottage\\" which had been threatened with demolition and was relocated to the rear of this property by the society in 1988. This operates as a local museum and houses the collection of the society. There is also a rustic timber pole shed and an open grassland car park area beside the inn. The building was reported to be in good condition as at 31 January 2014. = Modifications and dates = * 1860s hotel built * 1895-1937: Bank use and residential use - involved minor modifications including changes to southern end of the upstairs areas in 1931. * 1967-1981: Used as a museum to house the collection of the Rylstone & District Historical Society.

It was built from 1855 to 1865 by Chinese miners, probably from Southern China. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  The Chinese built aqueduct wall is believed to have been built around the gold rush days of Windeyer district which started in the late 1850s. There was a considerable Chinese presence in the area reaching as many as 1200 at the peak of the gold rush. There were a number of gold strikes, and the strike nearest to this location was the strike at \\"Deep Crossing\\". Whether the Chinese were the first or only prospectors in this vicinity is not known, but they often reworked claims that had been already left by Europeans, and this may have been the case here. The wall is believed to have been built by 12 Chinese men, supported by a cook. The time it would have taken to build the wall implies these men were supported by wages or kept in supplies while on the project. They may have been contract workers.  Description  This Chinese built aqueduct wall is built near the banks of, and following, the Meroo River. The nearest officially known gold settlement was Deep Crossing, which is on the next bend of the river down stream. This dry stone wall follows the Meroo River water course for approximately 350 metres. The wall ranges in height from a few stones to 3.6 metres in height. A large portion of it being over 1.8 metres in height. The wall is made of the shale rocks from the site, of flat rectangular shape and of various sizes, laid dry on their large sides. Rocks approximately 600mm x 600mm x 120mm deep are common. There are long sections of the wall fully intact. After the first 50 metres travelling from the south small breaks occur about every 15 to 20 metres, with a large break, due to a landslip at approximately the 140 metre line. By 230 metres the wall begins to break up generally, and soon after the blackberry infestation generally makes it inaccessible. At the top of the wall is a water race, which runs past the wall at each end, eventually travelling approximately 1 kilometre in total from its source, up-steam in the Meroo, to its finish at the end of Wall B. The river flows towards the South, from above the dry stone wall (A), past a central section (B) and past another dry stone wall (C) The central section contains the continued water race dug into the hillside, numerous deep round hole diggings, remains of a possible dwelling and mounds of tailings. Wall A faces the East, it is almost without biological growth. It looks quite a recent construction. Almost the whole of the top of the wall can be accessed except where the wall turns to face the south east, and the blackberry growth makes it difficult to continue. Wall (C) however faces predominantly south and is covered in biological growth including mosses and considerable blackberry infestation. This makes the section (C) wall difficult to access from anywhere except the top, and makes it also hard to measure or record with photographs. The wall was reported to be in fair to good physical condition as at 4 July 2000, with high archaeological potential. This cast facing wall is remarkably intact. In parts the wall is in immaculate condition looking as if it were built in quite recent decades. Very tall sections show the great skill of the masons. Weed and other plant growth on its face is minimal for about 90% of its length, making it almost all accessible. There are also considerable additional constructions associated with this site, in the central section, the second wall, across the River and the upper reaches of the race where the water was dammed and redirected from the river. Comparison with other Chinese built walls, and of other water race constructions, in Australia and overseas, would be valuable.  Heritage listing  This site shows significant evidence of Chinese presence in Australia, especially as this wall appears to be wholly attributed to the Chinese. The wall which was built to support a water race for alluvial gold mining in the valley of the Meroo River, is exceptional in its scale, being higher than most similar constructions having been built in very difficult terrain. It was built with only primitive implements, using a wooden bow and plumb bob to accurately provide minimum fails to the water course over a long distance. The wall is in excellent condition, a testimony to the considerable masonry skills of the Chinese builders. Gold Mining Water Race was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Gold was discovered in the district of Windeyer around 1850, and by 1858 there was a considerable Chinese presence in the district. This wall was built between 145 and 130 years ago by Chinese gold miners. They were part of the general Gold Rush phase of Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall displays excellent masonry skills. A remarkably long and high wall the area of the face is approx 400sm. It is an dramatic feature in the landscape , yet it blends beautifully with the winding river, and rocky hillside. The wall has remained largely \\"undiscovered\\" probably due to its remoteness and the way it blends with the landscape. It is also not marked on the local topographical maps while most other \\"diggings\\" are. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. A remnant of the Chinese presence in Australia during the gold rush period. It is important in that this wall is attributed solely to the Chinese workers. As the project was obviously a shared venture , over a long period of time, the social significance of the brotherhood and friendship of these 12 Chinese expatriates, and their achievement together with minimal materials and primitive tools is most impressive. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chinese designers used their considerable ingenuity and skill to collect water from the upper reaches of the Meroo River, where the stream drops quite rapidly. Using a small dam construction to collect the water initially, then a water race. The water was carded thus until the terrain became difficult, steep and rocky. Here the Chinese constructed a shale stone wall to support the race, and so carried the water around the bend in the river. The tool that was used to measure the level of the water course, and so to carry the water a long distance with a minimal drop, was a wooden bow and plumb bob. Taking the water at this higher level to the area of diggings and sluicing, allowed the workers then to process much more pay-dirt than the more typical method of digging it out and carrying it to the water. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wall constructions of this scale (height & length) are rare. This was principally due to the circumstances of the landscape: the steep sides of the hill, the available shale rocks, and the rich gold find that made it feasible. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. There are similar, but less imposing walls in other Gold Mining sites. For example in the Palmer River Catchment area (see Eric Rolls' book The Sojouners p. 214, and the Stoney Creek aqueduct (p. 215), 1300M long and an average 1M high. The use of an aqueduct was a common practice in many gold fields.

It will consist of several high-rises that will include apartments, condos, office, retail, and entertainment. Lincoln Yards will occupy more than 50 acres of land located on both sides of the North Branch of the Chicago River. It will be bounded by Webster Avenue to the north, Clybourn Avenue to the east, North Avenue to the south, and the Kennedy Expressway to the west. History A. Finkl & Sons Steel operated a mill along a roughly 22-acre lot along the eastern portion of the Chicago River in the Lincoln Park neighborhood from 1902 until it was demolished in 2012. The Lincoln Park location was Chicago's oldest steel mill. In 2006, it bought the site of the former Verson Steel on Chicago's South Side. It was purchased by a German company in 2008, and has since operated from that location. Since the demolition, there have been various proposals to connect the site to the popular Bloomingdale Trail. In 2016, real estate developer company Sterling Bay purchased the Lincoln Park site for a sum over $100 million and renamed the site \\"Lincoln Yards\\". The developer released plans designed by Chicago-based architectural firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill in July 2018. In exchange for an increase in density to allow for the substantial construction, Sterling Bay is to pay an $89 million fee and will make infrastructure improvements in the neighborhood to ease the increase in traffic. Sterling Bay estimates the entire development will take up to ten years to complete. The development was to also include a stadium and a concert venue. Thomas Ricketts, owner of the Chicago Cubs, owns a stake in the stadium. A Live Nation music venue was also proposed. Some local residents indicated they did not want a stadium or a venue. In early 2019, a Chicago alderman rejected this part of the proposal, suggesting that the development include more parkland and green space instead. Revised plans, released in January 2019, no longer included the stadium but instead incorporated more green space, roughly doubling the amount of space previously dedicated to parks. Ten aldermen out of the city's 50 aldermen declared their opposition to financing the revised project with $900 million of tax increment financing, arguing that more affordable housing should be provided on-site. However, with these changes to the plan, the development moved forward. In April 2019, Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot told the Chicago Sun-Times that her staff would, during her first post-election weekend, spend time examining the city's 600-page agreement with Sterling Bay regarding the development, believing that the city could reach a better deal. However, later that month the Chicago City Council approved plans for Lincoln Yards, including a tax increment financing agreement. In 2019, a lawsuit over 1.3 billion dollars of public TIF funds to pay for the development was filed but was unsuccessful.https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/09/10/lincoln- yards-1-3-billion-tax-subsidy-battle-heads-to-court-as-opponents-try-to-stop- controversial-project/ In 2019, Mayor Lightfoot announced that an advisory council may monitor the site and proposed developments.https://www.chicagobusiness.com/commercial-real-estate/lincoln- yards-get-robust-resident-involvement-lightfoot-says Potential tenants The development was one of the proposed locations that could have hosted the second headquarters of Amazon if the company chose Chicago.

The mining operations at the R√∏stvangen ore field were begun in 1904 and ran continuously until 1921, when the company went bankrupt. Copper- bearing pyrite was extracted at the mine. The mines were equipped with a laundry, post office, bakery, meeting hall, residential buildings, barracks, shops, and even a movie theater. The defunct Eidsfossen Hydroelectric Power Station was originally built to supply electricity to the R√∏stvangen Mines. From 1904 to 1909 there were 100 employees at the R√∏stvangen Mines. Between 1909 and 1915, the workforce was expanded to 170, and from 1916 to 1919 that number rose to 260. A downturn started in 1919, when the mines began experiencing economic problems. When the company went bankrupt in 1921, it had 120 employees. Cableway On February 18, 1910, a cableway was opened for transporting ore from the mine down to Tynset. It had more than 100 ore buckets and the transit time to Tynset was two hours and ten minutes. Each bucket could hold over 300 kg of ore, and almost 30 people worked daily on the cableway. After the ore was taken to Tynset, it was transported to Trondheim on the R√∏ros Line and then sent for processing abroad by ship. Bankruptcy The company went bankrupt in 1921. This was one of the largest bankruptcies in Norwegian history at that time. After the bankruptcy, all of the machinery was removed. Most of the houses and other buildings were demolished or blown apart, except for the largest structures, including the Heim building in Tynset and the Vidarheim building in Tolga. All of the workers moved away from the place immediately. Most relocated out of the district, but some remained in places near R√∏stvangen.

Early life Ross was born Szmulek Rozental on September 20, 1931Naturalization Papers near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He was the youngest of eight children. After the German Invasion of Poland, Ross' parents sent him to live with a Christian family. The family, however, feared punishment and sent Ross to live in the nearby woods. Imprisonment during the Holocaust In 1940, Ross was taken by the Nazis to the labor camp at Budzy≈Ñ; the first of ten labor or extermination camps he was imprisoned in. During his time in the camps, Ross was made to drink chemicals as part of the Nazi's medical experiments, had his back broken, and suffered from tuberculosis, lice, scales, and boils. He was selected for death at Budzy≈Ñ, but stayed alive by hiding in a pile of feces under a latrine. He was later sent to Krasnik, Radon, and Auschwitz. At Auschwitz, Ross escaped a death line by running away and hiding under a moving train. After his escape he was sent to Bietingheim, Vayhingen, Unterexinggem, Grossachsenheim, Neckarsulm, and Dachau. At Dachau, conditions were so bad that the prisoners turned to cannibalism. On April 29, 1945 he was liberated from Dachau by U.S. soldiers. The rest of his family, save for one brother, did not survive. Life in the United States On April 10, 1948, Ross was brought to the United States on the SS Marine Marlin, where he changed his name from Szmulek Rozental to Stephan Ross. He was placed with the Jewish Family and Children's Service in Boston, who sent him to the Windsor Mountain School. Ross was drafted by the United States Army and served during the Korean War. After the war, he attended Goddard College on the GI Bill. While there, he helped found the Plainfield Fire Department. He graduated from Goddard in 1959 and went on to earn his masters in psychology from Boston University. As he did not have enough money for both tuition and rent, he lived in his car while attending BU. He later earned a doctorate from Northeastern University. Ross became a licensed psychologist and worked for 40 years as a youth activities instructor and counselor for the city of Boston's Department of Community Schools. He also taught and counseled at Northeastern. =New England Holocaust Memorial= In December 1986, Ross formed a committee to push for the creation of a Holocaust memorial and museum in Boston. He received support from Mayor Ray Flynn, who promised that the city would donate land for the memorial, as well as state representative Kevin W. Fitzgerald (whose father was one of the soldiers that liberated Dachau), first lady Kitty Dukakis, and Newton, Massachusetts Mayor Theodore D. Mann. The memorial was completed in 1995 at a cost of $3.5 million. In 2002, a Liberators' Monument, which was part of Ross' original vision for the memorial, was added. Personal life In 1969, Ross married Suzanne London. Ross‚Äôs marriage to London ended in divorce. They have one son, Michael P. Ross, who was the first Jewish president of the Boston City Council, and a daughter Julie Ross, an attorney. His brother, the only other member of his family to survive the Holocaust, died in 1990. Ross resided in Newton, Massachusetts, until his death on February 24, 2020. Ross spent decades trying to find an American soldier he met at Dachau who hugged him and gave him some food and an American flag. According to Ross, the soldier \\"gave me a will to live, he restored my faith. He was the first person to show me compassion, he took me back to the civilized world\\". In 1989, Ross appeared on an episode of Unsolved Mysteries as part of his search. Although the soldier, Steve Sattler, had died before the episode aired, his family saw it and met with Ross in 2012. In 2010, Ross was named an Outstanding American by Choice by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In 2017, Etched in Glass: The Legacy of Steve Ross, a documentary about Ross' life, premiered at the Boston Jewish Film Festival. In 2018, his autobiography From Broken Glass: My Story of Finding Hope in Hitler's Death Camps to Inspire a New Generation was published.

It is part of the North Cascades Range. Trapper Mountain is situated southeast of Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest higher peak is Hurry-up Peak, to the west. Surface runoff from the mountain drains into Trapper Lake and tributaries of the Stehekin River. Climate Trapper Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Trapper Mountain centered as seen from Sahale Mountain The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Gulgong railway station opened on 14 April 1909 with the extension of the railway from Mudgee to Gulgong. The rail passenger service to Gulgong ceased on 2 December 1985 and freight services connecting Gulgong and Kandos on the Gwabegar line ceased in 1992. The freight-only Sandy Hollow‚ÄìGulgong railway line still operates through Gulgong, connecting to a section of the Gwabegar line beyond Gulgong that still handles freight services. The station building is now leased to the Mid- Western Regional Council.  Description  The station complex consists of a timber station building in a type 7 design with a skillion roof and a timber- faced platform dating from 1909, along with a pump house and dam.  Heritage listing  As Gulgong is an historic town with high tourist potential and the railway played a part in the development of the town, the remaining structures are significant in the overall development of the area. The structures are modest, unpretentious and consistent with pioneer type construction and the economy exercised in the building of new lines early in the new century. The structures were all built at the same time and retain a consistency of style. They are interesting in that no additional structures were placed on the site after the initial development so that the site represents a 1909 railway group. Gulgong railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare.

She currently lives in Colorado. Early life Woltman was born in Minnesota as third of six children to Ellanora and Leo Hurrle, who had a farm near South Haven. From a young age, Woltman had always wanted to fly. Career Woltman attended the St. Cloud Teacher‚Äôs College after school. After a few years of teaching, she moved to Texas and started training as a pilot. Her first plane was a Piper J3 and then she progressed from a private pilot to a commercial pilot. This earned her rating as an instructor for flying airplanes. Woltman attained her C-plane rating for airplanes with floats and her rating as a glider pilot. She flew competitively, and she also completed one of the major flights of the era for women, a solo flight from Houston to Anchorage in a Piper Super Cub with floats. Working as a charter pilot, Woltman flew over North America and also flew in the International Women‚Äôs Air Race and in the Powder Puff Race. In March 1961, Woltman started training as an astronaut. She cleared all physical tests and was a part of the First Lady Astronaut Trainees (FLATs). As next steps, few from the group of 13 went to advanced testing but since the project was not officially run by NASA, Woltman never stepped into the space. She was one of the thirteen women who passed all of the astronaut tests given at the Lovelace Clinic in 1961, making her a member of the Mercury 13. Woltman retired her pilot license in March 2014. In 2007, the University of Wisconsin conferred on Woltman and the remaining Mercury 13 astronauts an Honorary Doctorate in Aeronautics, honoring them as pioneers in aviation history. She was inducted in the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2008. After Mercury 13 Mercury 13 never reached their goal after the U.S. government shut down the women‚Äôs program without their ever being able to fly a space mission. Woltman moved to Colorado Springs in the early 1970s, where she did glider training and towing for Air Force Academy cadets at the Black Forest Glider Port.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Lue railway station opened on 10 September 1884 along with the extension of the railway from Rylstone to Mudgee. Passenger services were suspended from 2 December 1985 and the station formally closed from 18 March 1986, although freight services along the section of line continued until 1992. The line through Lue reopened for freight services on 2 September 2000; although the station itself was repainted by locals in preparation, it remained closed and boarded up, and all services on the section of line were suspended again on 30 June 2007.  Description  The station complex consists of a brick station building in a type 4 standard roadside third-class design with a brick platform, completed in 1884, and a concrete panel signal box in a type 5 design, completed in 1920. The station formerly had a dock platform on the down end for unloading wagons and a loop line siding opposite the station for stockyard purposes.  Heritage listing  Lue is an excellent small third class standard country station group with the main elements of station and residence intact. It is well sited and prominent from the main Mudgee road forming a significant element in the landscape and the understanding of the railways operation in the area. The buildings are of high quality and are good representative examples of their type. They indicate the importance of the location in the past for freight and passenger traffic and form an important link between the large Rylstone railway station and Mudgee railway station complexes, illustrating the range of sizes of buildings used at locations of varying importance. It is also in contrast to the smaller but similar design used at Capertee on the same section of line. Lue railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare.

So he cut out a block of earth, let it harden in the sun for two days, and used a knife to create his first sculpture. He showed it to his father, who recognized his talent and encouraged him to paint by purchasing paper, clay and pencils for the boy.Paluch, T., \\"The Color of Hope,\\" DSM Magazine, 16 February, 2016, His family encouraged him to pursue painting as a career. He obtained a BA in Fine Arts from Baghdad University in 1969.

However there was no clock tower structure present in this place for some period of time, the location managed to retain its name and still called by local people as Clock Tower or Manikkoondu in Tamil. To retain the glory of past, in February 2006, Erode City Municipal Corporation has planned to construct a modern clock tower in the same place. A 50-feet tall tower structure has been designed and constructed in 2009, along with a Police Watch Tower in the middle. Later in 2015, this tower has been removed and a new structure has been built with public-private contribution. And it is the third structure in the same place which is still serving for the public and retaining the glory.

Although it closed to regular passenger services in 1985, it is planned to restore a tourist service between Kandos and Rylstone in late 2018. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Rylstone railway station opened on 9 June 1884 with the extension of the railway from Capertee. The rail passenger service ceased on 2 December 1985. It is not known when the station was formally closed. Freight services beyond Kandos ceased in 1992. After the station's closure, it was used as a craft store and then later for storage. The first passenger service in over twenty years arrived at Rylstone in March 2016 as an initial one-off tourist service for the Rylstone Show. In October 2017, the state government pledged $1.1 million to reinstate the rail link between Kandos and Rylstone following an effort by the Kandos Museum and Lithgow State Mines Railway to form a tourist rail precinct. The works were expected to be complete by June 2018. The Kandos-Rylstone Rail Heritage Precinct group have leased the Kandos railway station and are aiming to establish a regular tourist service between Kandos and Rylstone by the end of 2018. Restoration works on what will become the group's regular rolling stock continues as of July 2018, with the hope of the works being completed \\"within a few months\\".  Description  The station complex consists of a timber station building of a type 4 standard roadside design, completed in 1884, along with a platform faced in pre-cast concrete and a corrugated iron goods shed in a side shed design with a 72' x 22' crane. It also includes a dock platform, jib crane and loading bank. The trees in the forecourt and station area are also included in the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Rylstone station group is a good late Victorian station complex situated in an important historic town. The station retains its setting with forecourt and fencing in the close to original form. The station building is a superb example of a timber country wayside station retaining original detailing, it is typical of many similar buildings constructed during the 1870s and 1880s, few of which survive. The brick residences (now sold) constructed at the same time as the station are in close to original condition and with the other buildings complete the group. Rylstone railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The Evacuation  By the end of October 1920, the White Army had been driven out of Southern Russia and Ukraine, and only held the Crimean Peninsula, defended behind the narrow Perekop Isthmus. When this last defensive line was breached by the Red Army during the Siege of Perekop, the commander of the White Army, Pyotr Wrangel, decided to evacuate. The operation had been preliminarily worked out and planned by General Wrangel's staff, so its implementation was carried out in good order. During the evacuation from the ports of the Crimean peninsula (Sevastopol, Yevpatoria, Kerch, Feodosia, Yalta) a total of 145,693 soldiers and civilians, not counting the crews, were taken on board on 126 ships and \\"sudenosheks\\" (small boats and tugs). This fleet, known as Wrangel's fleet, and composed of ships of the Whites' Black Sea fleet, foreign ships and the temporarily mobilized ships of the Voluntary Fleet, first sailed to Entente- occupied Constantinople. A significant part of the passengers left the ships here, replenishing the ranks of White Russian emigrees. Between December 8, 1920 and February 1921, the reduced flotilla sailed to the Tunisian port of Bizerte. The soldiers and civilians who were left behind in the Crimea, suffered under the Red Terror organised by B√©la Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka, and authorised by Vladimir Lenin.Rayfield, Donald (2004).

It is located in the industrial suburb of Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory. The AWM describes the Treloar Resource Centre as \\"the Memorial's conservation facility and store for large objects of military technology, including aircraft, vehicles, boats, missiles and guns\\". History From the 1950s the AWM used a warehouse in Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory to store items in its collection which were not on display. The first building in the Treloar Centre was built at the cost of $6 million during the early 1990s to replace this facility. It had 5,800 square metres of storage space and was air conditioned so that items could be properly preserved. The building was officially opened on 21 April 1994. The centre is named after John Treloar, the AWM's director for most of the period between 1920 and 1952. By 2017, the AWM had purchased five parcels of land at Mitchell to accommodate expansions of the Treloar Resource Centre. These included a block of land which was leased to a third party until 2040. At this time, the total storage space available to the AWM was 15,500 square metres. The AWM's website states that the Treloar Resource Centre contains \\"one of the world's leading military equipment collections\\". This includes a large number of World War I artillery guns. An annual \\"Big Things in Store\\" open day is conducted at the facility. In 2017 the AWM received approval to construct an additional building at the Treloar Resource Centre. This facility will provide a further 5,240 square meters of storage space.

It would be operated by a commercial entity and would employ 40 people. The spaceport will host a launch vehicle called Orbex Prime. The spaceport will be located on the A' Mh√≤ine peninsula in Sutherland, Scotland. Construction is set to begin in late 2021, with a first launch as early as 2022. Overview The facility would be operated by a commercial Launch Pad Operator, who has yet to be appointed. The proposed spaceport is expected to employ some 40 people directly and with another 400 jobs supported indirectly. It will be built through the local development agency, the Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). The submitted planning application shows that the spaceport will host a planned new rocket called Prime by the startup company Orbex.Scotland site selected as launch base for Lockheed Martin, Orbex. Stephen Clark, Spaceflight Now. 16 July 2018. The facility was originally planned to be shared by both Orbex and Lockheed Martin, and to potentially use two separate launch pads, as both rockets use different propellants. However, the final planning application includes only one launch pad.  Location  The location at A' Mh√≤ine peninsula was selected over two other Highland, Scotland locations: Unst, Shetland, and North Uist, Western Isles. The location would be useful for launching small satellites to polar orbit and Sun-synchronous orbit. The spaceport site is from the closed Dounreay nuclear research reactor. The nearest community to the spaceport is the crofting township of Talmine, alongside the Kyle of Tongue, with a population of 200. History The project is officially called UKVL Sutherland, and the project is being advanced by the development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), working in conjunction with the UK Space Agency, Orbex and Lockheed Martin. The proposed site was first announced at the 2018 Farnborough Air Show in July, and at that time was planned to be completed by 2020. However, the planning and consultation processes (and the COVID-19 pandemic) have all contributed towards delays. when initially proposed, the spaceport was estimated to cost ¬£17.3 million to build, ¬£2.5 million of which was planned to be provided to Highlands and Islands by the UK government. Initially there was mixed support amongst the local crofters. In November 2018, the Melness Crofters Estate (MCE) voted on whether to continue discussions about the proposal. Twenty-seven votes were cast in favour, with eighteen against and one spoiled ballot. In September 2019, HIE began a formal public consultation phase, ahead of the formal application for planning consent, which was expected to be filed in December 2019. In August 2020, the project was formally approved by Highland Council. With regulator approval to move forward, construction is planned to begin in late 2021.

It was established in 1987 as the first Penang- based private tertiary institution. The college provides various pre- university, diploma and degree courses, some of which are twinned with foreign universities. DISTED consists of two campuses - its main campus is situated at Macalister Road, while the college's School of Hospitality Management is located at China Street Ghaut within the city centre's UNESCO World Heritage Site. The college is wholly owned by Wawasan Open University.  History  DISTED College was the brainchild of three educationists - Gajaraj Dhanarajan, Hulman Sinaga and Sharom Ahmat - who in 1985 formed DISTED Services Sdn Bhd, a private limited company. The name DISTED is the acronym for Distance Education, which suited the original intention of the trio - to provide adults an alternate route to tertiary education; it was felt that, compared to high school leavers, adults had more limited prospects of obtaining higher education. However, due to the high costs of tertiary courses abroad, the trio soon had to alter their direction to cater to the youth. By 1987, contracts were signed with the British Columbia Open University, TAFE South Australia, Murdoch University and the Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education to provide off-campus courses to Penangites. Within the same year, DISTED College was registered with Malaysia's Ministry of Higher Education. DISTED took in its first cohort of students in 1988. At the time, it was housed inside a bungalow at Hargreaves Road in George Town. The lack of space forced the college to relocate to RECSAM within the suburb of Gelugor, and then to the St. Joseph's Novitiate at Kelawei Road (now part of Gurney Paragon). In 1995, DISTED College finally moved into its current premises at Macalister Road, occupying a mansion formerly owned by a prominent 19th century tycoon, Yeap Chor Ee.

The property is owned by Mid-Western Regional Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The town hall was built in 1880 under then-Mayor T. Clark. The building was severely damaged by fire in 1978, after which the Mudgee Shire Council vacated the building, moving to the former Cudgegong Council Chambers for eighteen months while new premises were built. It was renovated in 1978-79 at a cost of $100,000, and the Mudgee Library moved into the Town Hall from its former premises in the Mechanics' Institute in 1979. In 1980, the ground floor was sympathetically altered to provide shop fronts connected with increased tourist amenities. It was extensively renovated in 2012-13, extending the building so as to double the library space and adding new equipment and furniture for the theatre. In 2018, it contains the local library and theatre, with the theatre doubling as the Town Hall Cinema, showing new release films one weekend a month.  Description  The former Mudgee Town Hall is a highly significant 19th municipal building located in Market Street, the centre of Mudgee's business and commercial precinct. The building also forms part of a significant group of historic buildings on the northern side of Market Street that make a strong architectural contribution to the streetscape and the centre of Mudgee. The finely designed Neoclassical building served as the Town Hall until the 1970s. Importantly the public use of the building has continued with its adaptation to a library and theatre and remains today an important place in the social life of this rural town.Christo Aitken, letter supporting grant application, 2011 The building is small two- storey town hall, neo-classic in style, having stuccoed pediments to windows and the elaborate central roof gable containing the date and name plaque and ventilator. The structure is of brick with stuccoed quoins, window surrounds and central balcony - porch. A small mansard roof of corrugated iron is set behind a low parapet at the front and is surmounted by a flagpole turret with cast iron crestings.  Heritage listing  Mudgee Town Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Early life, private career, and community activism ≈Ωigmanov was born the son of Kalman ≈Ωigmanov and Ru≈æica (born Maƒçkoviƒá), who were a tractor driver and a housewife respectively, in Tavankut, Vojvodina, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). He was raised in that community and in nearby Subotica and later graduated from the University of Novi Sad Faculty of Philosophy. He is a professor of philosophy and has published in the field. He became politically active during the Yugoslav Wars following the breakup of the SFRY. ≈Ωigmanov was a co-founder of the magazine ≈Ωig, which he edited from 1996 to 1998, and worked at Radio Subotica from 1998 until 2002, when he founded the publishing house NIU Hrvatska rijeƒç.

Response to ICTY and MICT verdicts The 2016 election saw the return to parliament of Radical Party leader Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj following an absence of thirteen years, most of which he had spent on trial for war crimes at the ICTY. During the assembly campaign, the ICTY unexpectedly acquitted ≈†e≈°elj of all charges against him. ≈Ωigmanov described this as an \\"unpleasant surprise\\" for Vojvodina Croats, saying, \\"We know what we went through and that is why ≈†e≈°elj's acquittal is so difficult for us.\\"\\"Vojvodina Croats unpleasantly surprised with Seselj acquittal,\\" HINA, 31 March 2016. The Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT), a successor body to the ICTY, subsequently overturned part of ≈†e≈°elj's acquittal in April 2018 and found him criminally responsible for the persecution and deportation of Vojvodina Croats by virtue of an inflammatory speech he had delivered in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for Croats to leave the area. The Radical Party leader was sentenced to ten years in prison, although he was not required to serve any time as he had already spent more than eleven years in custody during the trial period. ≈Ωigmanov noted that this was the first time that an international court had recognized crimes committed against Croats in Vojvodina during the Yugoslav Wars and added, \\"we could say that a little justice has been served.\\"\\"Croats in Vojvodina consider Seselj's conviction 'little solace',\\" HINA, 11 April 2018.

It was designed by Alexander Dawson and built in 1862, with 1902 additions designed by Walter Liberty Vernon. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 December 1999.  History  Construction work on Mudgee Post Office Early postal services operated from a number of local stores and other premises until mid-1861 when the Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson designed a telegraph office and residence on the northwest corner of Market and Perry Streets. The Post Office operated for a period from the rear of this building and in May 1875 a separate post office building was built adjacent to the Telegraph Office in probably a reverse image of the original building.1996 Heritage Study prepared in association with Dept of Urban Affairs & Planning, Christo Aitken Architect & Heritage Consultant Alterations occurred in 1886 but in 1902 major remodelling and alterations were carried out by the Public Works Department, which included the design and construction of the colonnade and clocktower. The 1902 works appear to be the work of Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. A proposal to install a weight-operated clock did not proceed and in 1914 another effort was made to install a clock without success.  Description  A symmetrical, single-storey stuccoed brick composition in the Victorian Free Classical style. The arched colonnade has both doric and ionic derived columns and is flanked by projecting single bays in the Palladian manner. The end bays have moulded rectangular windows enhanced with quoining in rendered brick. Arched windows and doorways are located within the colonnade. A classically-styled rendered balustrade extends across the parapet. The three central bays of the colonnade have a classical pediment and parapet surmounted by a small central belltower. The physical condition of the building was reported as good as at 1 December 1999. The integrity of the building is good, although tower is defaced by telecommunications apparatus.  Heritage listing  Mudgee Post Office, circa 1920s The Mudgee Post Office and Quarters is significant as one of the first major country post offices built in the state. It is a fine civic building skilfully remodelled from its original Palladian form to the Victorian Free Classical style seen today. The form of the building is unusual in post office design and is expressive of the building's early date. The building is a key streetscape element within the western precinct of Market Street and forms part of an important group which includes the Police Station, former Cudgegong Council Chambers and Court House to the west.

The film was shot in 42 days and used more than 10,000 extras, which is a record amount for a Dutch production. The final shooting day was on 19 November 2017. The sound for film movie was produced by Dolby Atmos. Before the film's release it was already sold to multiple countries and territories, among them Germany, France, China, Spain, Turkey, South Korea, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States. In February Epic Pictures Group bought the North American distribution rights. Early testfootage of the film was shown on 31 March and 1 April at Dutch Comic Con in the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht. =Trailer controversy= In May 2018, the producers of the film announced that YouTube and Facebook had sent an email to them that they would not show the trailer of the film on their platforms because it was considered offensive to large groups of people. Producer Klaas de Jong also mentioned he got hundreds of angry mails from Christians who did not agree with their depiction of historical events. Release =Box office= The film premiered on 23 June 2018, in an open air screening on the Wilhelminasquare in Leeuwarden, as part of the celebrations around the European Capital of Culture, a week later, on 28 June, it was released in cinemas nationwide. After its first month it only earned ‚Ç¨332,785 back from its 8 million euro budget, making it the biggest box office bomb in the country's history. The producers of the film claimed this was because the warm weather and World Cup kept the public outside of cinemas. The film was released in 4DX in two Path√©-cinemas in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, making it the first Dutch film released in 4DX. Seven weeks after its release it was already moved to video on demand-platform Path√© Thuis. This was at the time the shortest window between a theatre release and home release for a big Dutch production, which normally takes a period of three months. The film was also later edited into a four-part television miniseries, where they showed unused footage of the film. =Critical response= The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from the major Dutch newspapers. The Algemeen Dagblad said that everything in this movie takes too long, ‚Äúthe fight scenes, the introductions of the characters and the explanatory dialogue slow down the movie‚Äù. De Volkskrant gave it two stars, praising the fight scenes but finding the screenplay clearly lacking in logic and tension. NRC Handelsblad said the movie was weighed down by a very top-heavy screenplay and an over reliance on drama. Trouw praised actor Gijs Naber but complained about the awful dialogue which was clearly written from a 21st-century perspective. De Telegraaf while praising the ambition of the movies said that it takes too long and is overly reliant on close-ups and slow motion-scenes. They also praised Jonathan Banks his role and remarked that it looked as if actor Jack Wouterse was in a completely different movie. Het Parool praised the fact that director Roel Reine put his own signature on the film and that the troubled production was barely noticeable. However they do mention that it is sometimes noticeable that they did not have enough extras in some of the fight scenes. =Historical inaccuracies= In an article by Asing Walthaus of the Leeuwarder Courant, historian Han Nijdam noted several historical inaccuracies. He pointed out that the castle in the film and the knights with chainmail armour are from the late middle ages and not from the early middle ages that the film depicts. He also complained that the film portrays the Frysians as barbarians in animal hides living in leaking huts even though it is proven that they lived in wooden houses with woven tapestries on their walls. It was his conclusion that the film puts spectacle over any form of historical accuracy. =Awards and nominations= The film was selected for the international Look-competition of the Ostend Film Festival. In July 2018, it was one of nine films shortlisted by the EYE film institute to be the Dutch entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not selected. The film played at the Netherlands Film Festival but was, to the surprise of some major newspapers, not nominated for any Golden Calves. =YouTube lawsuit= In November 2018, the producers of the film announced that they would be suing YouTube for 200,000 euros because illegal copies of the film were viewed half a million times on the website.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The church was first built in 1857, when local priest Father Callaghan McCarthy had built a church, sanctuary and sacristy. It was effectively rebuilt by between 1873 and 1876 to the design of Edward Gell, with Tambaroora contractor Mr. Webb and Bathurst stonemason Mr. Burns carrying out the work. The new design incorporated the pre-existing sanctuary and sacristy in the redevelopment while constructing the body of the current church. The foundation stone of the rebuilt church was laid on 7 December 1873 and it formally opened on 11 November 1876. The spire was added to the tower in 1911.  Description  St Mary's Roman Catholic Church is a sandstone church in Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic designed by Bathurst country architect, Edward Gell. It has an especially fine western facade with pointed arched doorway and side recesses and narrowly pointed stained glass windows. Beautifully scaled rose window in stone and stained glass. The church has a tower with flared copper spire balanced in a symmetrical composition with gable end of southern aisle. The side elevation features repeating pointed arched stained glass windows. The church organ was built in 1866 by J. W. Walker of London for St Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick. Under direction of Charles Richardson, in 1907 the organ was transferred from Randwick to Mudgee with a new set of pipes to the old specification. Richardson also decorated the display pipes in his style, and other alterations included the fitting of a new keyboard, the addition of a tremulant, and the removal of the hand-blowing apparatus.

During his reign, he implemented many reforms such as abolition of untouchability, freedom of association and introduction of representative government.Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare (1948). Historical Grammar of Apabhra·πÅ≈õa. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. . He signed the accession to the Indian Union on 8 March 1948 which ended the separate existence of Bhor state.WorldStatesmen - India - Princely States A-J Early years Raghunathrao Shankarrao was born to Pant Sachiv Shankarao II Chimnajirao (10th Raja of Bhor) and Jijibai Ranisaheb on 10 September 1878. His thread ceremony took place on 4 April 1887. He succeeded as 11th Raja of Bhor on 18 July 1922 following the death of his father. Raghunathrao attended the Poona Government High School, Poona and he passed his matriculation examination of the University of Bombay in the year 1899. He completed his higher education from Deccan college, Poona. While at the college he also attended the Law lectures regularly till 1905. After leaving the college, he read the Civil, Criminal and Revenue laws with a celebrated Government Law lecturer and Public prosecutor at Poona to prepare himself for the future as the Raja of Bhor. On the advice of the then Political agent of Bhor Mr. L. C. Swifte, he used to attend the court of H. F. Carvalho, the city magistrate of Poona in order to gain some knowledge of the practical working of Law in 1905. He took an intelligent interest in the proceedings of the court and also read through and studied several important cases that were placed at his disposal. After the observation for a long time, Mr. Carvalho wrote to Mr. Swifte that: In 1907, on the recommendation Mr. Swifte, he got a seat on the bench of Magistrates in Poona to get practical knowledge in criminal matters. In this capacity he worked incessantly and carefully for the next six years, deriving thereby good practices in the conduct of criminal business. He was appointed to bench magistracy in 1907. While he was at Poona for education and even during the long period he worked there as Honorary bench magistrate, he had occasion to be associated with the high officials and the leading and liberal- minded statesman of Poona, all of whom were ever pleased with the nobility and the affability of his mind and heart. The modesty and the gentility of his disposition and behavior had always won for him the good opinions of the successive Governors of Bombay, the commissioners and the Political agents. Mr. W. D. Sheppard the political agent and the Collector of Poona wrote a letter addressing Shrimant Babasaheb to his father His Highness Shankarrao Raosaheb: Raja Ragunathrao received two coronation medals as Yuvaraja, the first at the time of Coronation Darbar of King Edward VII in 1903 and the second at the time of coronation darbar of Imperial King George V in 1911. In June 1903 Shrimant Babasaheb was honoured with a Silver Medal at the hands of Lord Northcote, the then Governor of Bombay. In 1912 he was honoured by the same silver medal by Mr. L. C. Swifte, the political agent of Bhor and Collector of Poona on the behalf of Government. As Yuvaraja (crown prince) Raghunathrao also administered Vichitragad taluka. As a Yuvaraja he was well prepared by the knowledge of law and its procedure. His father rightly thought it proper to entrust him the management of Vichitragad taluka. He conferred with the powers of Assistant Collector, Sub-divisional Magistrate and Assistant Judge in 1913. From thence till his accession he looked to the affairs of that taluka with great ability, interest and zeal. In the year 1916 the Honorable Mr. W. D. Sheppard, Member of the executive council in his speech before proceeding to England, observed with the reference to Shrimant Babasaheb as follows: In 1918 Shrimant Babasaheb was appointed Assistant Recruiting Officer for the whole State and his vigorous and successful measures in obtaining recruits were highly appreciated by the Government of Bombay. Marriage Raghunathrao married Gangutai, the daughter of Balasaheb Vinchurkar on 1 June 1893. The couple had their first son Sadashivrao Raghunathrao Gandekar on 27 September 1904. Gangutai died in the year 1907. The death of her was a heavy blow to Raghunathrao. The dejection made him never to think of marriage again but at the Express and solicitous wish of his parents he married Laxmibai Ranisaheb, the daughter of Vasudeorao G. Puranik of Poona in 1909.

The constitution of the Cabinet is as given below: #President ‚Äì The head of the council #Diwan ‚Äì General charge of all the departments (Vice President) #Nyayamantri (Judicial Officer) ‚Äì in charge of the educational, jail and medical departments #Daftardar (Chief Revenue Officer) ‚Äì in charge of the revenue, the forest and P.

The liberal-minded ruler also set apart a sum of Rs.20,000 from his ancestral charitable fund, the interest on which is being utilised in giving scholarships to most promising but poorly circumstanced students of the State irrespective of consideration of caste, creed and religion, to enable them to pursue higher education.

Social media users started using the image as a meme at the start of 2017, and it went viral in August 2017 as a way to depict different forms of infidelity. The meme has inspired various spin-offs and received critical acclaim. Stock photograph The stock image was taken in the city of Girona in Catalonia, Spain, in mid-2015 by the photographer Antonio Guillem from Barcelona. Guillem told Wired he and the stock image models planned on having a session which would represent the concept of infidelity \\"in a playful and fun way\\". The boyfriend and girlfriend in the photograph are known by their stage names \\"Mario\\" and \\"Laura\\". \\"Laura\\" later described the experience shooting the stock images, saying, \\"When people saw us simulate those scenes in the street, they stopped to look and laugh and, in my case that I had to have a more serious face, I had a hard time to keeping it\\". The image was uploaded to Shutterstock with the caption: \\"Disloyal man walking with his girlfriend and looking amazed at another seductive girl.\\" Regarding the copyright status of this image, Guillem has stated that his images \\"are subject to copyright laws and the license agreements of the microstock agencies. It's not allowed to use any image without purchasing the proper license in any possible way, so each one of the people that use the images without the license are doing it illegally. This is not the thing that really worries us, as they are just a group of people doing it in good faith, and we are not going to take any action, except for the extreme cases in which this good faith doesn't exist.\\" Meme The first known use of the stock image as an internet meme was posted to a Turkish progressive rock Facebook group in January 2017. The post labeled the man as Phil Collins, who is being distracted from progressive rock by pop music. This meme was reposted on an English-language progressive rock Facebook page the next day, and then on Twitter on February 2, 2017. Later that month, the original stock photograph was shared on Instagram and got almost 30,000 likes. The meme started going viral on August 19, 2017, after a Twitter user posted the photograph with the man labeled \\"the youth\\" being distracted from his girlfriend \\"capitalism\\" by \\"socialism\\". Another Twitter user copied this meme, getting retweeted more than 35,000 retweets and nearly 100,000 favorites. The meme and its permutations went viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook. According to Adam Downer, an editor for Know Your Meme, the distracted boyfriend meme helped popularize a meme format called object labeling. The girlfriend in the meme generally came to represent something that one is supposed to do, and the woman wearing red came to represent something more desirable or riskier. The models \\"Mario\\" and \\"Laura\\" say they first learned about the memes based on their photograph when people started posting them to their social media accounts. Guillem told The Guardian, \\"I didn't even know what a meme is until recently. The models discovered the meme on social media and they told me about it. None of us could imagine the media repercussion that it has reached right now.\\" Some brands started using the meme when it started going viral. In early January 2018, a version of the meme referencing the biblical story of Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt went viral on Twitter. The meme was used in a sign for the \\"Enough! National School Walkout\\" gun violence protest in March 2018. On June 25, 2018, Twitter user Ernie Smith noted other stock images in which the girlfriend from the original meme is surprised looking at screens. The New York Times published the meme in its Business section on May 29, 2019, referencing the proposed merger of Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The boyfriend is labeled as \\"Renault\\", who is being distracted by \\"Fiat Chrysler\\" with his girlfriend \\"Nissan\\". Variations and spin-offs Meme inspired by a print of David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy Early variations of the distracted meme used other photos from Guillem's photo shoot of the three stock characters to create a story. In late January 2018, some social media users noted similarities between the meme and promotional image from Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout featuring Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett. On April 16, 2018, a Twitter user called the Joshua Reynolds painting David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy the \\"18th-century equivalent\\" of the distracted boyfriend meme, and the painting became popular as a similar meme with historic references. In early May 2018, a Twitter user posted the coin commemorating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with one of the characters from the meme. In early June 2018, film writer Peter Goldberg posted on his Twitter account a scene from Charlie Chaplin's 1922 short film Pay Day with a format similar to the distracted boyfriend meme. In early July 2018, a photograph of a woman eating ice cream with a man and a woman holding hands in Venice went viral because of its similarities to the distracted boyfriend meme. A version of the meme featuring a distracted groom went viral on Twitter in early October 2018. In Hungary, another stock photo of the same 2 models was used in a government campaign to promote child birth, which raised a lot of mockery. Reception Nathan Heller of The New Yorker wrote that \\"the delight of the Distracted Boyfriend meme was not unlike the perverse pleasure taken by Distracted Boyfriend himself: it allowed America to turn its attention away from much more important commitments.\\" Tiffany Kelly of The Daily Dot wrote that \\"the distracted boyfriend meme's range, unintentionally created by Guillem's portfolio, set it apart from other popular internet content [in 2017]\\". Clair Valentine of Paper listed the meme as one that defined the year 2017, writing, \\"They say that often, the most specific stories are in fact the most universal, and this meme's absurd popularity proves that point beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\" The meme made various lists of the top memes of 2017, including NDTV The Next Web, PC Magazine, The Ringer, and Narcity. The Washington Post listed the meme on its \\"Meme Hall of Fame of 2017\\", calling it \\"the ultimate stock photo meme with endless permutations\\". The Reddit moderators of the /r/MemeEconomy subreddit told Inverse that they thought it was one of the best memes of 2017. In April 2018, this meme won the Best Meme of 2017 category at the 10th Annual Shorty Awards. Joe McCarthy of Global Citizen wrote that the original photograph depicts \\"sexual harassment\\", and criticized most uses of the meme for failing \\"to transcend the image's inherent, toxic sexism\\". In September 2018, Sweden's advertising ombudsman determined the internet service provider Bahnhof had broken rules against gender discrimination when it used the meme in an advertisement which portrayed Bahnhof's employment opportunities as the attention-stealing woman and the ignored girlfriend as \\"your current workplace\\".

They are described as Nephite record-keepers, missionaries and prophets. Family tree Ammaron :Ammaron should not be confused with Amaron, Ammoron, or Amoron, three other Book of Mormon figures with similar names. According to the Book of Mormon, Ammaron (;churchofjesuschrist.org: \\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\\" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from ¬´ƒÉm¬¥a-r√§n¬ª Ammoron a frequent scribal variant in the Printer's ManuscriptR. Skousen, Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon (Provo: FARMS, 2004-2009), 3:1507, 6:3578-80.) was a Nephite record-keeper and perhaps a prophet. He was also one of the authors who wrote on the Plates of Nephi, which Mormon abridged. Ammaron took custody of the Nephite records after the death of his brother, Amos, in AD 306 and three verses contain Mormon's abridgment of his writings. In 321, he hid all the Nephites' sacred writings in the Hill Shim in the Land of Antum. He later instructed the ten-year-old future prophet Mormon to wait until he was 24 and then take the Plates of Nephi from the hill (leaving the other writings hidden) and continue the record. Amos, son of Amos According to the Book of Mormon, Amos was a Nephite record keeper. His father was Amos, and his grandfather was Nephi III, Son of Nephi the Disciple. Mormon is thought to have abridged his record which consists of 26 verses in the Book of 4th Nephi. Amos must have been exceptionally long-lived, for he had custody of the Nephite records for 112 years, approximately from AD 194 to 306 (although a certain commentatorBrant Gardner, 4 Nephi 1 suggests that this Amos may be referring to at least two different people). are an abridgment of his writings. When Amos died, his brother Ammaron took over as record keeper. Amos' record relates the degeneration of the society of the Nephites after the appearance of Jesus on the American continent. This degeneration is due to the pride of the people. Amos, son of Nephi According to the Book of Mormon, Amos was a Nephite record keeper and son of Nephi the Disciple. Amos had custody of the Nephite records for 84 years, from approximately AD 110 to 194. Upon his death the Book of Mormon record passed to his son Amos. Two verses, , are an abridgment (by Mormon) of his writings: > 19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last record, (and he > kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his > stead; and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also. > 20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still peace in the > land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the > church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; therefore there began to > be Lamanites again in the land. Corianton According to the Book of Mormon, Corianton ()churchofjesuschrist.org: \\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\\" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from ¬´k≈çr-ƒì-ƒÉn¬¥tun¬ª was a Nephite missionary, the third son of Alma the Younger (the first chief judge). Circa 74 BC (17th year of the reign of the judges), Corianton went with his older brother Shiblon and his father Alma, and five others (Amulek, Zeezrom, Ammon, Aaron, and Omner), on a proselytizing mission to the Zoramites in Antionum, while his eldest brother Helaman stayed behind. The group witnessed the peculiar worship of the Zoramites, including their prayers upon the Rameumptom. His father Alma reprimanded him for his grievous sins, commanded him to repent, and preached to him about the afterlife, the Resurrection, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ.‚Äì Shortly thereafter, Alma called him again to preach to the people. The last account in the Book of Mormon of Corianton is that he journeyed to a northern land to deliver provisions. Helaman, son of Helaman According to the Book of Mormon, Helaman, son of Helaman, (sometimes referred to as Helaman II) was a Nephite prophet who lived around 30 BC. His father was Helaman, son of Alma, who was also a prophet and military commander. The younger of Helaman's sons include the missionaries Nephi and Lehi. He served as chief judge for seven years and then gave the Judgement Seat to his son Nephi. He then died in 39 BC. Shiblon According to the Book of Mormon, Shiblon ()churchofjesuschrist.org: \\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\\" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from ¬´shƒ≠b¬¥lun¬ª was a Nephite missionary and record- keeper. He was the second son of Alma the Younger, who was the first chief judge. Circa 74 BC (17th year of the reign of the judges), Shiblon went with his father, younger brother Corianton, and five others (Amulek, Zeezrom, Ammon, Aaron, and Omner), on a mission to proselytize to the Zoramites in Antionum, while his older brother Helaman stayed behind. The group witnessed the peculiar worship of the Zoramites in their congregations, including their prayers on the Rameumptom. =Zoramite mission= At the beginning of the Zoramite mission, Alma prayed for Shiblon and the group for the Lord to sustain and guide them. As Alma clapped his hands on them afterwards, each was filled with the Holy Spirit, and each went separate ways to begin their missions. Through faith and prayer, they succeeded among the poorer classes, who had been shunned from other churches because of their lowly appearance. =Alma's counsel= In 73 BC, during Shiblon's mission to the Zoramites, Alma gave him counsel and advice. From these instructions, we learn that Shiblon was held in bonds and stoned for the Word's sake. According to Alma, Shiblon bore all things with patience because the Lord was with him. We also discover the following strengths and weaknesses that Shiblon may have possessed through the words of counsel Alma gives: Strengths *Steady and faithful to God since youth *Diligent, patient, and long-suffering Possible weaknesses *Remember to trust God *Continue to preach; do not be idle *Be diligent and temperate; do not be over-passionate *Do not be proud or boastful; be humble and sober *Be bold, but do not domineer =Importance of continual encouragement= Shiblon appears to obey his father's teachings; Alma advises that adult children need continual direction and encouragement from their fathers regardless of the child's maturity and station. =Record- keeping in later years= Circa 56 BC (36th year of the judges), Shiblon inherited the records and other items from his brother Helaman. He kept them for three years, then realized he would soon die. Because he could not deliver them to Corianton who had gone north in a ship, he gave them to his nephew Helaman II. As he predicted, he died shortly afterwards, c. 53 BC. =Name origin and other uses= Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley stated both names are probably related to the Arabic word shibl, \\"lion cub,\\" and argued that Shiblon may have been a variant of Shiblom. His student Benjamin Urrutia further connected it with \\"Jaguar Cub\\" imagery of the Olmec people.Benjamin Urrutia, ‚ÄúThe Name Connection,‚Äù New Era, June 1983, 39 Shiblon is also a Nephite word for a weight of silver, equal to half a senine of gold, or a senum of silver. See Book of Mormon weights and measures. Timothy, son of Nephi According to the Book of Mormon, Timothy was the son of Nephi, son of Helaman, and brother of Nephi the Disciple. At one point while preaching as a missionary, he was stoned to death but was raised from the dead by his brother. After the appearance of the resurrected Jesus Christ to the Nephites, he along with Nephi was chosen by Christ to be one of Twelve Disciples. Timothy is relatively unusual in the Book of Mormon for having a Greek name. (See also Mulekites.)

Life  Jeannette Abarbanell was born in Berlin into a prosperous liberal Jewish family. Eduard Abarbanell (1880-1865) was a well respected physician who had backed the liberal democratic aspirations of the 1848 revolutionaries. Hungry for learning, after a year, on the recommendation of a teacher, she removed herself from school and educated herself using a self-developed approach that involved extracting, interpreting and commenting on texts. By the time she was grown up she was exceptionally eloquent and well-read. She never lost her appetite for autodidactic education, and was able to deepen her knowledge of History, Philosophy and Applied Economics (\\"National√∂konomie\\") with study at Berlin University. When she was 20 she married Ernst Schwerin, another doctor. He shared her religious background and family tradition of socially based community mutual care. Their son, Moritz Schwerin (1873-1914) was delicate and needed a lot of care when he was small, but as he grew up Jeanette Schwerin became increasingly involved in social work and in the women's movement. She joined the Berlin Women's Welfare League (\\"Verein Frauenwohl\\"), the year of its creation by Minna Cauer. She quickly became part of a small energetic network of feminist activists that also included Lina Morgenstern and Helene Lange. In 1892 Schwerin and her husband were founder members of the \\"German Society for Ethnic Culture\\" (\\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr ethische Kultur\\") which in 1906 became the Berlin \\"Centre for Private Welfare\\" (\\"Zentrale f√ºr private F√ºrsorge e. V.\\"), intended to campaign against the negative impact of industrialisation - especially on women - and to promote reform of private welfare. Shortly after the society's foundation Jeanette Schwerin set up an information gathering centre which collected information on Berlin's various welfare organisations and initiatives in order to be able to provide emergency assistance to those in need faster and more appropriately. Schwerin teamed up with Minna Cauer in 1893 to establish the \\"Girls' and Women's Group for Social Work\\" (\\"M√§dchen- und Frauengruppen f√ºr soziale Hilfsarbeit\\"). She was initially uncertain about the direction the group might take, warning fellow members to avoid \\"dangerous dilettantism\\" and giving her own maxim as \\"not good works but welfare\\" (\\"nicht Wohlt√§tigkeit, sondern Wohlfahrt\\"). In 1897 she took on the overall leadership of the group and set out an agenda for the year with the goal of training \\"professionally competent working women for welfare care\\". As chair of the \\"Commission for Female Industry Inspection\\" of the Association of German Women's Organisations (\\"Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine\\" / BDV), in 1894 Jeanette Schwerin submitted a petition to the Reichstag demanding that women should be able to become Industry Inspectors. As a member of the BDV executive (from 1896) she campaigned for collaboration between the middle-class feminist movement and its proletarian counterpart. Shortly before she died she was able to publish the first edition of the BDV journal, \\"der Centralblatt des Bundes Deutscher Frauenvereine\\". She also expanded the so-called \\"Berlin course\\", which became \\"an annual course for training professional social work\\". She was succeeded by Alice Salomon who joined the group in 1895 and quickly became Jeanette Schwerin's \\"right hand\\". Jeanette Schwerin died in Berlin a few months short of her forty-seventh birthday, probably from cancer.

They were built from 1870 to 1878. They are being refurbished as part of the new Gulgong Holtermann Museum, with new buildings being constructed at the back of the shops to house the museum's collection. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016.  History  =Gulgong and the gold rush= Tom Saunder, a local shepherd, located gold on the surface of Red Hill, now located in central Gulgong, on 14 April 1870 and reported his discovery to Sergeant O'Donnell at the police station at 2 Mile Flat. The news spread rapidly from there, and the first small rush began. By June 1870, 500 people had camped on the new diggings at Adam's Lead. The SMH in its \\"Chronicles of Occurrence\\" in December 1870 encouraged the reader to 'now rush to Gulgong'! By January 1871 the population of the area had grown to 3,000. Other discoveries followed at other local leads such as Happy Valley, Caledonian and Canadian Leads and Home Rule, and by the end of 1872 there were 20,000 people on the Gulgong fields. The alluvial leads in the district were among the richest in the State. Within the first four years of discovery, over 300 000 ounces of gold were recovered. The Gulgong Goldfield produced 275 000 pounds of gold, most of which was won from old stream gravels as much as 60m below the surface, several kilometres from Gulgong. Due to its rapid development, Gulgong was initially a primitive community with quick timber construction predominating in the first years of the gold rush. The nationalities on the field like elsewhere in NSW were many and varied including Bulgarians, Greeks, Scottish, Americans, Canadians, Irish men and Chinese, as well as native-born Australians. It was a long trip from Sydney, to Gulgong but the trip was worthwhile for hundreds of miners. They travelled by train from Sydney to Wallerawang, thence by mail coach to Mudgee, and from there by Tom Tarrant's coach or Cobb and Co or horseback.\\" By 1876 the boom had begun to wane and it was all but over by 1880. Consequently the once booming town was reduced to a village which went on to service local farmers and pastoralists. =The Buildings= The earliest building standing on the site today is the small timber and tin-lined American Tobacco Warehouse. The side wall of this structure is clad in such a way that indicates there was clear access from the side that now contains The Greatest Wonder. The original Greatest Wonder building was also standing in February 1871, as declared in an advertisement of that period and captured in a historic photograph by Henry Beaufoy Merlin in 1872. This building was originally a roughly built timber framed structure that only stood for a few years, and was rebuilt a few years later under the ownership of Robert Robinson. The Greatest Wonder of the World The \\"Greatest Wonder of the World\\" was opened by Simeon Moses, an importer of men's clothing, including the Colonial Boot & Shoe Depot. Simeon was the proprietor. When Simeon Moses planned to leave Gulgong at the end of 1873 he held a sale. Moses left Gulgong to take over the Royal Hotel in Mudgee, and the Greatest Wonder of the World was taken over by another brother, Abraham Moses. However, this was short-lived and notice was given that the furniture of the Greatest Wonder was to be sold up on 14 July 1874. A week later on 21 July a notice in the Gulgong Evening Argus noted that the business of Clothier, Boot and Shoe Manufacture, and the liquidation of liabilities and debts was to pass to Abraham. The Greatest Wonder Of the World store was offered for sale on the 13 March 1875 . :'The Splendid Freehold Property at the establishment of the GREATEST WONDER OF THE WORLD , Queen Street. The property contains sufficient rooms, double lined and papered, suitable for a nice snug hotel, with kitchen and servant's room, bathroom and pantry, well fitted up. For a business site it cannot be surpassed. The allotment is full depth, facing the Telegraph Office and Court House at the back. This central property will be sold a bargain. Apply to A. Moses Queen Street.' An auction notice appeared 3 months later on 5 June, to be sold on the 9 June by Plunkett & Co. The former Greatest Wonder was sold to Robert Robinson. When Robert Robinson bought this building from Moses it was said he renovated or rebuilt it, to create a new post office. However, before the building could take up the role as Post Office, the Government of New South Wales ordered the Post Office to be moved to the Telegraph Station in the Police Compound. It appears that the renovations were extensive. Full width windows were added across the main street facade, the parapeted rectangular gable was removed and rear and side walls were constructed of stone. Robinson sold the improved shop to Samuel Bishop in 1880. The American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium building was sold to Paul Harford in 1879 then to Charles Zimmler in 1883. Samuel Bishop was a prominent Gulgong resident, working as an auctioneer and land agent and later serving as Town Clerk and Inspector of Works and sextant of the local cemetery. Following his purchase of the Greatest Wonder building, he used the premises as a bookseller and stationer for the next two or more decades. Behind the two shop-front timber buildings, the Greatest Wonder and the American Tobacco Warehouse, stood an old timber framed house with various later additions. It appears that the first room of this house predated the present stone walls of the \\"Greatest Wonder \\" store, and possibly dates from c. 1876. Rates notices provide names of \\"occupiers\\" of this land from that date, and the initial small single roomed cottage, with an end wall fireplace was probably the home of Samuel Trevenen Bishop. The house was a family home and there is evidence that two Bishop daughters were born there. Samuel Bishop died at Gulgong in 1915 while still the owner of the Mayne Street shop. His son-in-law, William Christian, became the new owner of the shop and ran a watchmaker and jewellery business there from 1934. Christian and his wife returned to Gulgong in 1933 after an sbence of many years. American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium Menser Moses, the brother of Simeon Moses, operated the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium next door. The building was sold to Paul Harford in 1879 then to another Gulgong figure, Charles Zimmler, in 1883. =Holtermann Collection= Bernhard Otto Holtermann Holtermann came to Australia in 1858 from Hamburg. Initially employed as a waiter, Holtermann met Polish miner, Ludwig Beyers and the pair travelled to Hill End and began prospecting in 1861. Due to their lack of success Holtermann had to find work where he could and by 1868 he was the licensee of the All Nations Hotel but he and Beyers still had a claim worked by hired hands. In October the night-shift workers found the world's largest gold bearing reef material in goldfield. Holtermann was a rich man. He went on to live in St Leonards and became a member of the Legislative Assembly for St Leonards. While he was in Hill End, Holtermann had met photographers, Henry Beaufoy Merlin and Charles Bayliss. After he found the \\"Holtermann Nugget\\", Holtermann assisted the pair in their work by funding their project of creating a photographic documentation of the settled areas of NSW. These photographs included Hill End and the Gulgong goldfields and they constitute a detailed and significant record of life on the gold fields. They were first exhibited at the Mitchell Library in Sydney in March 1953. The collection included many scenes of goldfields life during the height of the early rush in the early 1870s. Many of the buildings included in the street scenes at Gulgong and Hill End have disappeared. Several of the photographs in the Holtermann collection were displayed at international exhibitions in Philadelphia and Paris where they won awards. The collection disappeared from view by the turn of the century. The collection of glass negatives resurfaced in a private home in the early 1950s. The photographs were exhibited in 1953 after almost 70 years. Among the Gulgong buildings photographed by Merlin and Bayliss was the \\"Greatest Wonder of the World\\" and the \\"American Tobacco Company\\", capturing the Moses brothers outside their stores during their ownership. These photographs are commemorated in the Gulgong Holtermann Museum, which now operates out of the buildings. =Gulgong Holtermann Museum= The buildings were refurbished in the 1970s, but subsequently fell into disrepair. They were then acquired for the new Gulgong Holtermann Museum, which would display the UNESCO-listed Holtermann Collection in which the buildings feature. The project was launched in the existing buildings in January 2015. The buildings subsequently underwent restoration, with attempts to return the facade to its appearance at the time of the Holtermann photographs. Stage 1 of the restoration was completed in May 2016. Three new multi-function pavilions by architect Jiri Lev were built behind the original buildings from 2015 to 2019. The museum officially opened on 26 October 2019.  Description  The two goldrush era commercial buildings have gabled iron rooves, timber framed shop fronts. They both were constructed as timber framed and clad with corrugated iron lined buildings. The American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium remains in its original state, with the original rectangular parapet containing the name of the store. It presents to the street as it did when photographed by Merlin in 1872. This shop has a large shop area at the front with doorway access to the street and a large showcase window. To the rear of the shop space is a small space opening to the back yard. The American Tobacco building appears to have been the first constructed, and retains much of its original fabric. The Greatest Wonder store was largely rebuilt in 1876 when, as the town grew and became more prosperious the owner upgraded the building with the aim of it becoming the town's post office. The timber and corrugated walls were replaced with rubble stone walls and brick quoining. Full windows front the street on both side of the central doorway. The parapeted gable was removed and a bull nose verandah added to the street facade. Behind two shop fronted buildings there was a timber framed house the first room of which predated the stone wall at the rear of the shop. This was the one room cottage of owner Samuel Trevenen Bishop. This structure no longer stands. The buildings were in fair to good condition as at 2 March 2016.  Heritage listing  The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance as they demonstrate the impact of the gold rushes on the creation and development of towns and villages in NSW. The state heritage significance of the two buildings is enhanced through their association with the Holtermann Collection of photographs, which provides a unique documentation of the development of the colony in the 1870s. Through the collection, the buildings have an historic association with Bernhard Otto Holtermann, a German gold miner, sponsor of the Holtermann Collection, entrepreneur and later Member of the Legislative Assembly. The buildings have state level aesthetic significance as they are now rare and representative examples of rough, \\"erected-in-a-hurry\\" vernacular buildings, built to service the burgeoning gold rush population around Gulgong-one of the richest goldfields in NSW. The 1876 remodelling of \\"The Greatest Wonder of the World\\" is an example of the innovative reuse of a simple earlier structure as a more substantial building. The buildings are also increasingly rare examples of still-standing goldfields buildings documented in the Holtermann Collection. The Greatest Wonder of the World and American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance as they demonstrate the impact of the gold rushes on the creation and development of towns and villages in NSW-Gulgong being one of the richest goldfield regions in the state. The pair of neighbouring buildings together demonstrate the way in which such gold towns began and developed as the gold finds increased the wealth of the population. Both buildings were built in the early years of the gold rush in Gulgong when commercial building were hurriedly thrown together to service the initial burgeoning gold rush population in the area. The American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium remains in its original state of construction and layout. The Greatest Wonder of the World was upgraded and remodelled in 1876 as the proprietor prospered from the gold rush economy and became established in the town. The building was rebuilt as a random stone constructed post office building, incorporating the original layout and some materials. This is a pattern settlement and construction typical of gold rush towns across NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance for their association with the Holtermann Collection of photographs, and Bernhard Otto Holtermann himself. Holtermann was a German born gold miner and later businessman and politician. Holtermann, mining partner Ludwig Hugo Beyers and several others set up the Star of Hope Mining Company and, in 1872, a 286 kilogram \\"nugget\\" was discovered in the works. This was reputedly the largest piece of gold bearing material in the world. The Holtermann Collection of photographs is a highly regarded collection of photographs of the settled areas of NSW taken in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, incorporating the mining towns of Gulgong, Hill End, Tambaroora and Home Rule. Financed by Holtermann, the collection documents the everyday life of these gold mining towns. The broader collection was used by the colonial government in international exhibitions, winning an award at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. The buildings also have an important historic association with the Gulgong goldfield-one of the richest yielding goldfields in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance for aesthetic values as now rare examples of rough, \\"erected-in-a-hurry\\" vernacular buildings built to service the burgeoning gold rush population around Gulgong-one of the richest goldfields in NSW. The 1876 remodelling of \\"The Greatest Wonder of the World\\" is of significance as an example of the innovative reuse of a simple earlier structure as a more substantial building, signalling the evolution of the town from camp to village. Together these buildings are of state heritage significance as they together demonstrate a pattern of construction and development typical of the development of gold rush towns in NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance for their ability to demonstrate early \\"make do\\" construction technology and the personal resourcefulness necessary to make the timber framed buildings with square studs, no noggings and saplings between, which were typical of gold rush buildings across NSW. They also provide information on the way gold rush towns evolved from their makeshift beginnings to more substantial townships as individuals and the community prospered through the fruits of the gold rush. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance as rare examples of gold rush commercial buildings dating from the early period of the significant goldfields at Gulgong-one of the highest yielding goldfields in NSW. The buildings demonstrate construction techniques used in the early and hasty establishment of goldfields towns of NSW. They are also an increasingly rare example of still-standing goldfields buildings documented in the Holtermann Collection. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Greatest Wonder of the World and the American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are of state heritage significance as representative of hastily erected buildings from the early establishment of goldfields towns in NSW.

Not soon after, the band began recording demos and tape traded with other music fans all over the world. One such tape trader, was Florida's Chuck Schuldiner, who in 1985 asked Carlson if he would like to join his own band Death. Carlson accepted under the condition that Olivo would be the band's rhythm guitarist. Carlson and Olivo then moved to Florida to join Schuldiner, putting their own band; which had changed its name multiple times before settling on the name Repulsion; at this point consisting of the two and drummer Phill Hines, on hold. However, not soon after, then-Death drummer Kam Lee departed from the band due to creative differences between him and Schuldiner over control of vocal duties. A short time afterwards, Olivo and Carlson moved back to Michigan and reformed Repulsion, along with Dave 'Grave' Hollingshead, who had recently been arrested for grave robbing, where they recorded their debut album Horrified, along with new guitarist Aaron Freeman.

History  The bridge was built in 1909 as part of the extension of the railway from Gulgong to Dunedoo. The construction of the bridge was reported to be the main challenge for the contractors building the extension. Numerous difficulties were experienced sinking the bridge cylinders \\"through the drift sand to a very hard and uneven basalt at the bottom of the creek\\", and progress was slow, but it was completed by December 1909. The Dunedoo extension was formally opened in December 1910.  Description  The bridge carried a single-track railway on an open deck (with transomes). It spans were , , three at , and . The four shorter approach spans were timber girders. The three spans were timber trusses of the Howe-type with timber compression diagonals, vertical tension rods and six bays.

The island was once part of the tidal ford supposedly built by the Romans. Industrial activity has changed the river currents and the island has become substantially reduced in size and split into islets. Islands in the River Clyde Islands of the River Clyde, rather than sand or mud banks only exposed at low water, once included in order, working upstream towards Glasgow :- Bodinbo, Newshot, Ron, Sand Inch, King's Inch, Buck Inch, White Inch and Water Inch. Colin's Isle was located in the Cart Water near its confluence with the Clyde. The name 'Inch' is Scots deriving from the Gaelic 'Innis', an island. Milton Island view from Milton Island Bollards on the River Clyde The Dumbuck Perch. Lying between Dumbarton and Dunglass Castle below Dumbuck Hill the island is recorded as 'Green Inch' on William Roy's map of 1747-55. By 1821 the island is recorded as Millton Island, lying just off shore from the village of that name. The Ordnance Survey Name Book of 1860 records Milton Island as \\"An Island in the foreshore of the Clyde at Milton from which it is named. It is never covered at High Water above the H.W.M. [High Water Mark] shewn.\\". The old Esso terminal lying just upstream of Milton Island has had a significant effect on the patterns of erosion and deposition to the extent that the island is no longer a single island but of 2018 exists as three small grassy islets that lie within the larger boundary of the old island. The Dumbuck Perch (NS 4132 7385) stands nearby as a slightly elevated area strewn with stones. Dumbuck Ford Suggested remnants of the paved Roman ford looking towards Dumbuck Hill Suggested remnants of the Roman paved ford The Lang Dyke The Lang Dyke (Erskine Bridge in background) At low tide the River Clyde at Dumbuck could be forded and in Roman times to facilitate the crossing a wide causeway was supposedly constructed running northwards from Longhaugh, curving through the river-dyke and passing as a low mound towards the beach. The causeway continued as with a cobbled surface atop a gravelly mound continuing towards the Long Dyke and the Longhaugh Light. It then ran across Milton Island and went on to run through a field gate and on as a low mound to Dumbarton road. North of Dumbuck some road metalling was traced. On the south side of the river it is thought that the causeway continued towards Bishopton Fort. The Romans required a link between their fort and the Antonine Wall that reached at least as far as Old Kilpatrick. Although convenient as a means of crossing the river on foot and horseback, the shallowness of the estuary meant that larger ships could not reach Glasgow. This was the lowest fording point on the River Clyde; Glasgow was the lowest bridging point. The Dumbuck Shoal or hirst presented a particular challenge to deepening the river channel. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries determined efforts were made to remove this gravelly sandbank but with little success. Jetties were built to encourage the water flow to scour the shoal, but again met with limited improvements in the channel's depth. However, Dumbuck Shoal remained a problem - \\"The first and grand obstacle is Dumbuck Ford (12 miles below Glasgow Bridge), where, the river dividing itself into two channels, the reflowing current is greatly weakened, and the bottom, being covered with a crust of hard gravel, cannot be worn down to the proper depth; but if a jetty were extended over the south channel, to confine the current, and the hard crust of gravel removed by dredging, the reflowing current would then act with greater force, and soon grind down a deep and capacious channel.\\" The original 'Lang Dyke' was constructed in 1773, later using stone from the Rashielee Quarry near Park Quay, finally resulting in the loss of the Dumbuck Ford and a great improvement in the navigation to Glasgow. In Scots 'Buck' refers to a place where water gushes or pours forth whilst the 'Dum' refers to a fort as in Dumbarton. Archaeology Dumbuck Crannog and Dumbuck Hill. To the west of Milton Island lies the well known pre-Roman Dumbuck crannog-type structure. Excavations have revealed that the timber round house platform was built of layers of brushwood, earth and stone and brushwood held in place and strengthened by large wooden piles. A small log-boat dock still containing a log-boat was also found. In 1868 an oak dug-out canoe 22' (6.7m) in length and circa 2'10\\" (0.9m) was found near Milton Island containing deer horn, six stone axe heads and a possible paddle.

After her experience with a triple talaq, she was encouraged to fight for the rights of Muslim women. In addition, she also fights for the rights of women who have become victim to the practice of nikah halala. A fatwa was issued by a Shahar Imam Mufti Khurshid Alam calling for social boycott of Khan for speaking out against Islamic practices. Nida Khan got married on February 18, 2015, after which she was pressured for dowry. While taking her masters exam, she was dragged away from the examination center by her husband for which she was given the title of ‚ÄúIndian Malala‚Äù. Her husband beat her so badly that she had a miscarriage, and she subsequently has called her ex-husband her child's \\"murderer\\". Her husband gave her a triple talaq, or an instant divorce, and she was kicked out of the home on July 17 of 2015. After her ex-husband threatened her in May 2016 after telling the family of someone he was going to marry about her experience, Khan decided to take the matter to the police. The police refused to register her complaint and only did so after a court order. Following her divorce, she had to enter into wedlock with her father-in-law and brother-in-law and consummate their marriage so that they could undergo the process of nikah halala which would allow her to remarry her first husband. She then refused and wrote to UP CM Yogi Adityanath to abolish that law because she believed it to be an \\"evil\\" practice to dissolve marriages. She has now started a non-profit called Ala Hazrat Helping Society, which helps Muslim women deal with issues of triple talaq, domestic violence, polygamy and other cultural practices.  Excommunication  Shahar Imam Mufti Khurshid Alam dismissed Khan from Islam for speaking out against a practice he argues is permissible in the Qu'ran. He declared: > \\"No medicines will be provided if she falls ill. If she dies, no one is > allowed to offer ‚Äònamaz‚Äô on her ‚Äòzanaja‚Äô (funeral procession). She cannot be > buried in kabristan (graveyard) after her death...Nida wants an amendment in > Shariah while Islamic laws were made by Allah. As Nida has been giving > statements against Quran and Hadith, she is dismissed from Islam.\\" She has since stated, ‚ÄúNo one can ostracize me from Islam. Only Allah can decide who is guilty.‚Äù Khan has the support of many women and is protected by two gunmen. The NCM passed an order and asked the District Magistrate of Bareilly Virendra Kumar Singh to offer protection to Nida and provide her with security. He stated: \\"In the light of threats given to Khan in the grab of fatwa, the National Commission for Minorities strongly recommends providing security to Miss Nida Khan at the earliest so that nothing untoward happens to her. Mere issuance of a fatwa cannot be a hindrance in grant of any fundamental rights guaranteed to a citizen under the Constitution of India and it does not forbid a person to practice his/her religion.\\" References External links https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/uttar-pradesh/fatwa- against-triple-talaq-victim-nida-khan-in-bareilly-465068.html http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jul/26/shahar-imam-two-others- booked-for-threatening-triple-talaq-victim-nida-khan-in-uttar- pradesh-1848950.html https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-s-stand-on- triple-talaq-gives-hope-for-justice-says-nida- khan/story-4qatVX85P0IPxF9JcUcMyM.html http://zeenews.india.com/hindi/india/up-uttarakhand/bareilly-court-take- decision-on-the-favour-of-triple-talaq-victim-nida-khan/419235 http://zeenews.india.com/video/india/morning-breaking-bareilly-court-declares- nida-khans-triple-talaq-invalid-2125682.html http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jul/18/bareilly-court-declares- nida-khans-talaq-invalid-orders-probe-into-domestic-violence-1845224.html https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/fatwa-issued-against-activist-nida-khan- cash-reward-for-chopping-her-hair-1292332-2018-07-21 https://hindi.timesnownews.com/india/article/fatwa-against-triple-talaq- crusader-nida-khan-aala-hazrat-seminary-cleric-in-bareilly-asks-people-to- boycott-her/255693 https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news+track+english-epaper- ntrack/justice+for+nida+khan+bareilly+court+declared+the+instant+divorce+given+by+her+husband+invalid- newsid-92606862 Category:Indian women activists Category:Indian Muslims Category:Indian feminists Category:Victims of domestic abuse Category:Violence against women in India ","title":"Nida Khan"},{"id":"57958084","text":"The Riding Avenger is a 1936 American western film directed by Harry L.

Shield  The first official description of the coat of arms remits to the elements of the flag and is composed as follows: Given the lack of precision to define a correct blazon, was approved a decree on 8 June 1983 blazoned the shield of the region as follows: The four castles evoke the region's history as a frontier zone caught between the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile, and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada and the Mediterranean Sea: four territories of land and sea, Christians and Muslims, adventurers and warriors, all of which created a distinct Murcian culture. The four castles also can refer to the four lordships that initially carved up the area after it was conquered by Alfonso X of Castile. The seven crowns were granted to the Kingdom of Murcia by the Castilian Crown. The first five crowns were granted by Alfonso X on May 14, 1281, when he granted the standard and municipal seal to the capital city of Murcia. The sixth crown was granted by Peter of Castile on May 4, 1361, in honor of the loyalty of Murcia shown to Peter's cause during the War of the Two Peters. The seventh crown was granted by Philip V of Spain on September 16, 1709 in honor of the loyalty of Murcia shown to Philip's cause during the War of the Spanish Succession.  Official design  * The official design is commonly used by the autonomous institutions of Murcia, although it coexists with a simplified design of it (a logo). * According to the official blazon, the official design is not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules. * The blazon does not specify that the castles not specify that they are open or they must have voided gates and windows, usually Azure, and their design should include at least two windows. * Proportions of the charges in relation to the dimensions of the shield are wrong, according to the blazon, they are inscribed in the dexter canton and the sinister base, so each group of charges should equal the ninth part of the escutcheon. Coat of arms of the former Council of the Province of Murcia * The shield shape is rectangular with convex corners at the bottom and the Spanish style, with an almost semicircular bottom edge. The official design has a bordure Or not blazoned. * The Spanish Royal Crown has not a cap Gules, an element commonly represented in Spanish heraldry. * The escutcheon of the official logo, approved in 2008, best fits to the official blazon.  Former Provincial Council  Shortly before the establishment of the self-government, the Council of the Province of Murcia officially approved a coat of arms, that was used previously since July 12, 1976 (the Spanish monarchy was restored in November 1975). The provincial coat of arms appeared in the center of a cobalt blue flag. The Murcia Province quarterings and a central inescutcheon were standing for: Caravaca de la Cruz, Cartagena, Cieza, Lorca, Mula, Totana, La Uni√≥n, Yecla and the City of Murcia (inescutcheon). The crest was the Spanish Royal Crown. Its usage ended with the adoption of the current symbols of the autonomous community on August 9, 1982.

Crawford House or George Crawford Towers, is a historic high-rise apartment building at 84-96 Park Street in New Haven, Connecticut. Completed in 1966, the fifteen-story building is a significant mature work of architect Paul Rudolph, and a good local example of Brutalist architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015, and as a non-contributing element to the Dwight Street Historic District in 1983. It is owned by the city of New Haven, which uses it for public housing. Description and history Crawford Manor is located on the western fringe of New Haven's downtown area, at the northwest corner of Park Street and MLK Jr. Boulevard. It is set on a small parcel fringed with greenery on the street-facing sides, and parking and the access drive on the west and north sides. The building is fifteen stories in height, with an irregular C-shaped footprint. The building is built with a steel frame and concrete blocks, and is finished with a rusticated concrete finish. Most architectural elements are consist along vertical orientations the entire height of the building, with rhythmic placement of porches (with either rounded or squared outsides), some of which project further than others. Full- height windowless piers separate other visual elements, including windows and porches, from each other. The interior is finished in a manner similar to the exterior, with ribbed rough concrete elements, and poured concrete floors and ceilings. It now houses 109 units, either studio or single bedrooms. Construction on Crawford Manor was begun in 1964, in order to address a well- documented shortage of public housing for needy senior citizens. It was designed by Paul Rudolph, then the head of the Yale University School of Architecture, and a well-known advocate of what has since been called Brutalist architecture. Originally designed as a thirteen-story building in 1962, it was enlarged due to increased demand. When completed in 1966, the building was by far the largest senior housing facility in the city. It was named in honor of George W. Crawford, the city's recently retired corporation council.

It is the band's second album based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings, after their 1993 debut album Journey of the Dunadan, and their second release not to be a concept album, after 1998's On to Evermore. It is the first album to feature singer Susie Bogdanowicz after she joined as band member, and as such the first album to feature the band's longest and steadiest line-up, which would last until their tenth studio album, 2007's Culture of Ascent. The Middle-Earth Album was jokingly marketed as a live album recorded during a performance at The Prancing Pony, a fictional inn in Bree in Lord of the Rings. The first half of the album (up to \\"The Man in the Wood\\") emulates the sound of an actual live performance at the inn, with an audience cheering and singing along as the band performs songs about the lore of Middle-earth; to capture the spirit of an actual band performing in Lord of the Rings, the album is much more folk and acoustic-oriented than other works of the band, and heavily features traditional instruments such as harpsichord, fiddle and recorder. The second half retains the same lyrical orientation, but is recorded as a more traditional studio album, and features more progressive elements and electric instruments.  Production  The lyrics of the album were written by Steve Babb, while Fred Schendel wrote the music. In a 2010 interview, Babb referred to The Middle-Earth Album and 2009's Three Cheers for the Broken-Hearted as the Glass Hammer albums straying the most away from the band's usual sound, stating \\"we may throw the odd curve ball now and then.\\"  Track listing  Personnel ; Glass Hammer * Fred Schendel ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, main keyboards, guitars, mandolin, percussion, wind instruments * Steve Babb ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, bass guitar, additional keyboards, percussion * Susie Bogdanowicz ‚Äì lead vocals on \\"Mirkwood\\" and \\"Mithrandir (This Fading Age)\\", co-lead vocals on \\"The Last Ship\\" * Walter Moore ‚Äì lead vocals on \\"Sweet Goldberry\\" ; Additional musicians * Felicia Sorensen ‚Äì lead vocals on \\"As I Walk\\" * Sarah Snyder ‚Äì co-lead vocals on \\"The Last Ship\\" * Dr. Thomas Hammett ‚Äì vocals * Dr. David Luther ‚Äì vocals * Brad Marler ‚Äì vocals * Jamie Watkins ‚Äì backing vocals * Tim Starnes ‚Äì fiddle * Bob Stagner ‚Äì extra percussion on \\"Mithrandir\\" ; Production * Fred Schendel, Steve Babb ‚Äì production * David Wyatt ‚Äì cover art References Category:Glass Hammer albums Category:2001 albums Category:Middle-earth music Category:Folk rock albums by American artists ","title":"The Middle-Earth Album"},{"id":"57958259","text":"The list of shipwrecks in November 1859 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during November 1859. 1 November 2 November 3 November 4 November 5 November 6 November 7 November 8 November 9 November 10 November 11 November 12 November 13 November 14 November 15 November 16 November 17 November 18 November 19 November 20 November 21 November 22 November 23 November 24 November 25 November 26 November 27 November 28 November 29 November 30 November Unknown date References 1859-11 Category:Maritime incidents in November 1859 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in November 1859"},{"id":"57958282","text":"Ina Hartwig (born 11 July 1963) is a German writer, literature critic and academic lecturer.

He became justice of the liberty of Ulster in 1425 and was knighted in the same year. In 1427 he was sent by the Parliament of Ireland with the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Henry Fortescue, to England to complain to the English Crown of numerous wrongs suffered by the people of Ireland. Some of these grievances were personal, as Fortescue and Alleyn complained of numerous insults and assaults they had suffered in connection with the mission itself, since those opposed to it had physically assaulted them. The Crown ordered that those responsible for the injury to Fortescue and Alleyn should be punished.

It was designed by Designed by the Colonial Architect‚Äôs Office under James Barnet and built by J. Douglas. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  = Background = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a NSW Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW. In 1863, the Postmaster General WH Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in NSW in 1858. The NSW colonial government constructed two lines from the Sydney GPO, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in NSW compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the Post Office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until January 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country NSW from the late 1880s onwards. Again the Post Office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster-General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department, with Telecom and Australia Post created as trading entities. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = Orange Post Office = The first European settlement in Orange began during the early 1820s, when a convict cattle station was established. The region was opened up for free settlement after 1826, when Governor Darling redefined the limits of location. Originally known as Blackmans Swamp, the village of Orange was proclaimed and surveyed in 1846. The first post office was established in 1849, and is reported to have been within the store of John Woodward, fronting the road to Bathurst. Orange's population began to rise rapidly with the discovery of gold in the district, and the village gradually filled with buildings of more permanence. The second post office was constructed during this period (1851‚Äì55) with a John Arkins as Postmaster. Arkins' annual salary was ¬£12, increasing to ¬£50 by 1855 when James Dale was Postmaster, and then to ¬£100 by 1861, an indication of the growing postal business in Orange. In December 1860 the Telegraph reached Orange, six years after its introduction to Australia. The Telegraph Station Master was Robert Pizey, who was appointed with a salary of ¬£150. Pizey was succeeded by Charles Cooper as Telegraph Master in October 1862. From 1 January 1870 the post office and telegraph offices were amalgamated in Australia. In Orange, Charles Cooper stayed on as Telegraph Master while his wife Rose Cooper was appointed Post mistress. It seems that the two offices operated out of the same building at this time, although no official record of this exists. In 1877, Charles Cooper wrote to the Post Master General asking for further assistance in the running of the Post Office, complaining that he was often at the office from 8.30am till 10pm, longer when he had to receive or dispatch mail. As a result of Cooper's request, he was appointed as Postmaster as well as Telegraph Master from 15 October 1877, a position he held until his retirement in 1897, and an assistant was employed at ¬£100 per annum. The Colonial Architect James Barnet prepared plans for the present Post Office during 1877, which would adequately accommodate both the postal and telegraph services. The plan included accommodation for the District Surveyor and Road Superintendent, as well as the Post and Telegraph Office in the one building. The estimated cost for construction came to ¬£6,000. The building tender was accepted from a Mr J. Douglas on 18 November 1878. A clock and turret were added to the design during 1879 at an extra cost of ¬£395, with the clock itself costing ¬£205. The building was completed on 29 December 1879 and officially opened by the Postmaster General, Mr S. Samuel on 10 February 1880. During 1903 the decision was made to take over the entire building for use as the Post Office and to carry out alterations and additions. A tender from Mr J. H. Gains was accepted for the work at ¬£1,397. In August 1903, the Road Superintendent vacated the section of the building he had occupied, and the Post Office moved into this section while the work was completed in the main office. Three upstairs rooms, which had been occupied by the School of Arts were also taken over by the Post Office, while the telephone switchboard was placed in the upper front room. The repairs and alteration were finalised on 14 July 1904 at a total cost of ¬£1,500. Further additions were made to the Post Office in 1913. A number of further alterations to the building have occurred since this time, including the relocation of the southwestern stair, addition of the toilets in the 1950-60s and electrification of the clock mechanism in 1983. The Post Office interior was remodelled in to improve retail services.  Description  Orange Post Office is an imposing, finely scaled and detailed two-storey Victorian Free Classical building, and is located within the heart of the city's civic centre and is surrounded by predominantly two-storey retail and commercial late nineteenth- and mid- to late twentieth-century buildings. It is constructed of rendered and painted masonry in a cream and stone painted colour scheme. The predominantly hipped and gable-ended roof is of corrugated iron, with a balustraded parapet to the northern facade and part way down the western facade. There is a central clock with a white and black face installed at the centre of the northern facade parapet, and it is surmounted by a broken-apex pediment. Below the clock face is a dentilled, moulded string course and there is a bracketed moulded string course on the first floor level. A pyramidal corrugated iron roof supported by cast iron corner posts, with an ornate weathervane at the apex, caps off the open belfry behind the clock face. The roof of the two-storey section is punctuated by three tall, rendered and painted corbelled chimneys; two at the eastern edge and one at the south-western side. The northern facade has a two-storey verandah, with rendered masonry arches and columns to both, and infills to three bays of each side of the upper floor. The first-floor centre verandah is painted brown and cream and has a bituminous-coated floor, timber balustrade painted to imitate masonry and board and batten soffit. The ground-floor open arcade runs the entire length of the facade and comprises arched bays and a central colonnaded porch. This verandah has a pebblecrete floor, concrete steps, board and batten ceiling, black wrought iron balustrading and large pendant lights. The masonry arches have decoratively moulded architraves and prominent keystones. The post box niches in the Post Office Lane facade have lockable gates and concrete steps, with brown tiled floors. The northern facade also comprises a variety of column types, both attached and freestanding, ranging from squat Corinthian-styled columns supporting the moulded window arches to Ionic-styled main columns and square corner pilasters. Fenestration of the building is symmetrical about the centre line of the front facade, with casement windows featuring arched fanlights in the verandah infills of the top floor and original French doors. Additions, largely in English Bond face brickwork, have occurred to the rear of the building and in several different stages. These incorporate the weatherboard infill of the upper-floor verandah, the two- storey brick addition to the south-western corner of the two-storey original section of building, the weatherboard addition of a rear dock and two single- storey gable-ended brick additions to the eastern and western boundaries. A concreted yard is retained between these additions and the rear. There is also a more recent skillion-roofed brick cycle shed at the south-western corner of the site. The interior spaces of the ground floor of Orange Post Office include the carpeted retail area to the north-east, and separate carpeted retail premises in the north-western corner. There are also sheet vinyl floored mail sorting and storage areas to the south, a post boxes wing in the south-western corner and carpeted offices to the centre eastern side. The rear dock space has a textured steel plate floor. The ground-floor ceilings are varied. The retail area and separate retail premises have a plaster ceiling with moulded cornice and exposed beams. There is a plasterboard ceiling in the rear dock and suspended ceilings in the mail room and offices. There is both exposed and enclosed air conditioning ducting in the mail room, retail area and offices, with fluorescent lighting throughout the entire ground floor. There are original or early architraves located to the original openings and some fragments of early skirting in the stairwell. However, much later architraves and skirting are dominant on this floor. Windows on the ground floor generally comprise single upper and lower pane sash windows, with arched top sashes and white painted frames. Internal doors are modern flush, half glazed and sliding doors. There are later front doors in the separate retail premises and automatic doors in the Post Office. Walls are rendered and painted masonry in a generally grey colour scheme standard to the Australia Post fitout of the 1990s and there are smooth-rendered, Doric-styled structural columns located in both the retail area of Australia Post and in the adjacent retail premises. There are no fireplaces retained to the ground floor. The main stair to the first-floor has been relocated during past renovations and comprises grey painted turned timber posts and balusters with a shaped rail. Treads are clad with vinyl sheet with black edge strips. The first-floor is largely unoccupied and the Post Office currently utilises the vinyl floored north eastern corner lunch room and verandah, as well as the southeastern corner and southern locker rooms and bathrooms and carpeted northern meeting room. Ceilings to the first floor are a combination of board and batten to the lunch room and southwestern locker room, suspended ceilings to the meeting room and adjacent vacant room to the south, and flush plaster ceiling in the hall, southeastern locker room and stairwell. There is a plasterboard ceiling in the southern verandah infill and v-jointed boarded ceiling to the northern verandah infills. There is a ceiling fan in the lunch room and the entire floor is lit by fluorescent tube lighting. The wide first- floor skirting appears to be original to the original building fabric, with original architraves. There is later, plain skirting and architraves to the later additions to the building. Windows on the first-floor are predominantly two pane upper and lower sash windows, with many later multi-pane windows in the infilled rear verandah. Internal doors are largely four panel original or early, with some later flush doors to later partition walls and former loading area at the centre of the southern verandah infill. There are early internal windows in the former light well on the eastern side. The first-floor walls are predominantly rendered masonry, with later partition walls. The first floor has a cream/apricot and grey trim colour scheme. Fireplaces have been bricked in or boarded over and only one surround has been retained in the southeastern locker room. Signage for the Post Office comprises a freestanding standard Australia Post sign on the front facade, general shop signage related to the separate retail premises and an attached \\"Post Office Lane\\" sign to the north western corner. The street and footpaths are landscaped with trees, planters and low flower beds. The adjacent Post Office Lane is treated with planter boxes, lamp posts, seating, shrubs, trees and a currently disused kiosk. = Condition = As at 27 June 2001, Orange Post Office is generally in good condition, with some evidence of previous patching. There is some internal water damage and internal downpipe replacement to the first-floor western verandah infill. The exterior fabric remains largely intact, although the arcading has been partially filled in. The interior fabric has been substantially altered. The Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, including architectural details such as the classical front porch with fluted columns, central pediment, and parapeted roof, and its overall form, scale and style. = Modifications and dates = The original Post Office building completed in 1879 appears to have comprised the northern two-storey section, probably with several rear additions. Unknown additions have been recorded as occurring in 1891‚Äì1892, possibly including the stepped down, two-storey addition to the northwestern corner of the original section. In 1899 a Telephone Exchange was opened in Orange, this probably relates to the spaces allocated as such in the 1903 plans of the south-western corner. 1903-4 additions saw the renovation to incorporate the entire building for use by the Post Office. Three upper rooms formerly used by the School of Arts were taken over and the telephone switchboard was placed in the upper front room. 1942 plans indicate the relocation of the southwestern stairwell as having already occurred, shifted to the west and they indicate the presence of the eastern stairwell which was later removed and a light well created, the date of this change is unknown. The date of construction for the weatherboard infill of the rear verandah is unknown, and addition of the male and female toilets to the eastern end, possibly 1950-60s construction. Plans appear to indicate that in 1979 the third post box bay to the southern end of the western facade was added. Some time after 1979 a section of the rear ground floor verandah was enclosed and extended to form the current dock area and the northern facade post boxes were removed, date of construction is unknown. The electrification of the clock mechanism occurred in June 1983. The extension of the eastern side single-storey section of building to the south occurred prior to 1995, probably when demolition was occurring to the rear of the site. This is probably close to the time when the brick cycle shed to the southwestern corner of the site was built and the rear ground-floor verandah disappeared. An extension of the western side wing appears to have occurred before these changes, possibly in the 1970s. saw the photographic recording and demolition of the former stables to the south of the site for car parking. standard Australia Post interior fitout to the ground floor retail area, construction of new partition offices to the eastern side ground floor, separation of the northwestern retail space and installation of automatic front doors.  Heritage listing  As at 27 June 2001, Orange Post Office was significant at a State level for its historical associations, strong aesthetic qualities and social value. Orange Post Office is associated with the early development of the area in the mid-nineteenth century as it is linked with the original post office established in 1849. It is also associated with the rapid growth of the population of Orange due to the discovery of gold as a second post office was required in the early 1850s to meet the increased demand. Orange Post Office is historically significant because it is associated with the development of communications services in the Orange district in the 1870s as the post office and telegraph services were amalgamated. Orange Post Office also provides evidence of the changing nature of postal and telecommunications in NSW as the telephone exchange was introduced in 1903. Orange Post Office is also historically significant because it is associated with the NSW Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, which designed and maintained a number of post offices across NSW between 1865 and 1890. Orange Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a distinctive example of the Victorian Free Classical style, with strong visual appeal. It forms part of a historic streetscape and makes a significant contribution to the character of the Orange civic precinct. Orange Post Office is also considered to be significant to the community of Orange's sense of place. Orange Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.

Orange Post Office is historically significant because it is associated with the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, which designed and maintained a large number of post offices across NSW between 1865 and 1890. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Orange Post Office is an architecturally distinct building of Victorian Free Classical style, with such finely scaled and detailed characteristics as the pediment with open apex, parapet concealing roof, and classical arcade. Orange Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a fine example of the Victorian Free Classical Style with strong visual appeal. It forms part of a historic streetscape and makes a significant contribution to the character of the Orange civic precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a prominent civic building with strong streetscape appeals and the centre of communications for over a century, Orange Post Office is considered to be significant to the community of Orange's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has some potential to contain archaeological information which may provide information relating to the previous use of the site and the evolution of the building and out- buildings associated with use by the Post Office. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Orange Post Office is an important building, as it is linked to the early development of the city and surrounding region. It forms a key element of a set of Victorian buildings, enhancing the character of the civic precinct with its fine architectural scale and form. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The blast and a resulting fire destroyed the office and killed 29-year-old Henrik Christensen. It has been presumed to be a political attack, but no one has been convicted. Theories concerned the possibility that the victim was killed by right-wing opponents, by a bomb of his own or by another left-wing group. Background and explosion The small Danish far-left organisation International Socialists (IS) had an office in S√∏ller√∏dgade, N√∏rrebro, Copenhagen where about 20 local members were based. Henrik Christensen was one of the IS members there. The bomb exploded around 11:30 am, shortly after Christensen had met fellow partymate J√∏rgen Lund on the street, presumably after receiving mail. Christensen died from the blast but Lund survived. Investigation and perpetrators The attack was a major case for the Danish police and the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET). The office fire and extinguishing water damaged traces of evidence and the authorities have been unable to identify the culprits. Detectives have believed that the explosive may have been a letter bomb.PET-kommissionens beretning, bind 11, side 251. Assistance from the British Scotland Yard found no detailed conclusion about the bomb, only that it consisted of TNT. As a result, the case remains unclear. The IS immediately assumed that neo-Nazis were responsible. Some months before the bombing, neo-Nazis and Danish and Swedish anti-racists clashed during a demonstration in Lund. One theory from the detectives was that the bomb was an act of revenge from the neo-Nazis.PET-kommissionens Beretning, bind 11, side 251-252. An organisation called Free Denmark K12 (Frit Danmark K12) claimed responsibility in a letter. This organisation also sent threat letters to five other Danes.PET-kommissionens Beretning, bind 11, side 240-241. In 1998, Frede Farmand, an autodidact journalist known for his controversial investigations of neo-nazi and sect-like groups, claimed on television that he had been aware of a bomb plot and warned the Danish intelligence about it in 1992. Farmand claimed ties to Albert Larsen, a member of the neo-Nazi Partiet de Nationale. Larsen was questioned by PET and acknowledged having infiltrated left-wing groups but denied knowledge of the bomb. On 27 April 2013, a former neo-Nazi, Kim Fredriksson, said to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet he had information about the attack. According to Fredriksson, a now-deceased Danish-German member, referred to only as 'MS' from the Blood & Honour network, probably orchestrated the bombing. MS was briefly jailed in 1994 after police found TATP explosives in his apartment. He died in 2001 having suffered from cystic fibrosis. Based on this new information, the Copenhagen police force reopened the case. Media coverage Danmarks Radio sent a radio documentary in five parts about the incident in 2019.The Bomb at S√∏ller√∏dgade, podcast (in Danish), Danmarks Radio, P1 Initially, the reporter of the documentary openly declared that she had known the case first-hand since childhood and until now had believed right-wing extremists were behind the bomb, and that the police investigation had been flawed. Left-wing sources in the documentary claimed police had defined three hypotheses from the beginning of the investigation: The bomb could have been constructed by the victim himself and exploded by a mistake, or part of an internal strife between left-wing factions, or it could be an attack by right- wing extremists. Neonazi sources were also interviewed and claimed the clashes between them and left-wing fractions had been scattered and far from enough to cause retaliation in the form of bombs, and that right-wing groups were usually the ones being attacked by antifascists. The documentary also mentions that, according to police, IS had a meeting with the Irish Republican Army in February 1992. However, the retired police officer who had been leading the investigation said that a three-point hypothesis never existed and the investigation had been completely open to all possibilities, but ended blindly. As an unresolved murder case, it is still sealed, and the reporter could not be granted access to files.

He was born in Kilby, Leicestershire, the son of Rev. Henry Kebbel, vicar of Wistow and Kilby.The Times (7 November 1917), p. 9. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School and at Exeter College, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he gained a second class BA in the Greats in 1849. He then studied law, being called by the Inner Temple in 1862. He started his career in journalism in 1856, joining the Conservative- supporting Press newspaper. He would remain a supporter of the Conservative Party for the rest of his life. In 1873 he joined the Standard as a leader writer, where he also contributed articles on politics, sports and rural life. From 1858 he enjoyed a close friendship with Benjamin Disraeli. According to Lord Rowton, Disraeli had wanted Kebbel and Lord Barrington to write his official biography and that he had left written instructions to that effect.The Times (28 October 1910), p. 11. However, after Disraeli's death in 1881, Kebbel and Rowton examined Disraeli's papers at Hughenden Manor but no such instructions were found. The biography was then entrusted to William Flavelle Monypenny and completed by George Earle Buckle. Kebbel's book The Agricultural Labourer was a success and went through four editions. After his death, The Times said that Kebbel was \\"always a countryman at heart...He was no mean sportsman; his happiest reminiscences were those of hours spent with dog and gun\\". In 1873 Kebbel married Evelyn Catherine Clarke, who died in June 1912.

Solomon-Godeau has produced over 100 works in 236 publications in 4 languages. Her writing focuses on feminist theory, photography, 19th-century French art and contemporary art, and she offers a reassessment or revision of the ideas presented by the artistic \\"canon\\" and of some of her predecessors in the history of art, such as Martha Rosler and Susan Sontag. In a 2004 essay she describes herself as among those who \\"intellectually came of age as postmodernists, poststructuralists, feminists, Marxists, antihumanists, or, for that matter, atheists.\\" and later clarifies; :I do not consider my work to be particularly theoretical, although my writings on photography, like those on art history or contemporary art, are informed by the theorists, past and present, who have shaped my thinking overall. Perhaps my essays are best characterized as a form of practical criticism insofar as they engage with specific bodies of work, historical contexts, social relations, and institutional structures, rather than with the more philosophical questions manifested in the new field of the philosophy of photography. Her essays have appeared in journals including Art in America, Artforum, The Art Journal, Afterimage, Camera Obscura, October, Screen, and many have been collected in anthologies in various languages.

It was designed by John Job (J. J.) Copeman and built by J. H. Gain. It is also known as Berrilee and Tabratong. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The house was designed by J. J. Copeman and built by J. H. Gain for Mrs Robert Frost in 1902. Being located in the main street of the town, opposite Cook Park, it is a key domestic architectural element in the townscape of Orange. Its location, landscape setting and high architectural quality indicate its importance. The house was first owned by Robert Frost (a major local brick- maker), and eventually was bought by P. C. Weston, whose daughter Miss F. Weston left it to the church for use in association with the adjacent Wontoma Private Hospital.National Trust of Australia, 1983. Its bathroom was modified in the 1930s. Miss Weston became a patient in the nursing home in 1980 until her death on 14 December 1981. In 1983 Berrilea cottage bequeathed to the Uniting Church. The church's Wontama Village Nursing Home has been operating on parts of the site since 1967. The home (cottage) was initially considered for self-contained flats, but in May 1987 it became the Wontama Day Care Centre and incorporated the administration office. 24 self-contained units called \\"Carinya\\" (Happy home)') were opened in 1991. 1990 plans of the Wontama site show the proposed use of Berrilea as a day therapy centre, a use which did not eventuate at the location of the former stables. Another plan from 1990 approved by the Heritage Council was for demolition of the former tack room at the north of the stables to construct the Wontama Workshop. Orange City Council listed Berrilea on its Local Environmental Plan in 2011 as an item of state heritage significance.  Description  The Edwardian house has wide wooden vernadahs, external lacework and a large formal garden and includes stables at rear (now a double garage). The house is a particularly fine example of Edwardian architecture with excellent external detailing. Being located in the main street of the town, opposite Cook Park, it is a key domestic architectural element in the townscape of Orange. Its location, landscape setting and high architectural quality indicate its importance. The house is set in a peaceful shadowy garden with large trees. Curtilage to be the lot boundary. The house was designed by J. J. Copeman and built by J. H. Gain in 1902. It is of tuckpointed Flemish bond brick with a hipped slate roof, moulded chimneys and projecting roughcast gable. The verandah to three sides has cast iron corinthian columns and excellent decorative cast iron brackets and valances. It has a straight-pitched iron roof and a gabled portico above the main door. Windows have moulded brackets and there is a rendered string course at sill height. The front door has leadlighting, and three french doors open onto the verandah. Other than a few alterations such as the 1930s bathroom and the fireplaces in the drawing room and dining room, the interior layout and detail remain in substantially original condition. The stables at the rear (now a double garage) are of plain brick like the house with a timber extension at the back. They are in fair condition. A tankstand on very high piers is attached to the stables - it is still used in drought. The house in made of Flemish bond brick, with tuckpointing, slate roof, cast iron, leadlighting, and timber. = Modifications and dates = In 1983 Berrilea cottage was bequeathed to the Uniting Church.

The City Hall flanks one of its side, and nearby is located St. Martin and St. Nicholas Cathedral. Location The Old Market Square marks the center of Bydgoszcz, Polish city established in 1346 by king Casimir III the Great. The place faces watercourses on both of its flanks: * Brda (river) river, 100 m from its northern frontage; * a leat channel (), originally dug to power mills ('M≈Çyn in polish), running 150 m from its western frontage. Quaint and historic streets stem from this square: * Northbound towards Grodzka street and Brda river: Mostowa street and Father Tadeusz Malczewski street; * Eastbound towards Podwale Street: Krƒôta street and Teofil Magdzi≈Ñski street; * Southbound towards D≈Çuga street: John II Kazimierz street and Stephen B√°thory street; * Westward towards' Jezuicka Street: Nied≈∫wiedzia street and Farna Street. History Bydgoszcz market place has been charted in 1346, then paved in 1604. Until the end of the 17th century, court judgments were carried out there in public. It was the administrative and commercial heart of the city till the beginning of the 20th century, where Bydgoszcz economic, cultural and social life teemed. The market and the rim of properties located around constituted the core of the nascent city. Further expansion followed with plots built along Jezuicka or D≈Çuga streets. =Elements from excavations= Relics of the former Town Hall Archaeological diggings carried out in the area of the place unearthed early Middle Ages artefacts, indicating that the area was inhabited before Bydgoszcz establishment. Oldest items, dating back to pre-settlement, have been found in the north-east corner of the Old Market Square: ceramics from the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century. Objects from the Lusatian culture (pottery fragments) have even been recorded below the early medieval layer, in several locations around the place. Another excavation, performed in 1969, exhumed relics of St. Ignatius of Loyola Jesuit Church, located on the western flank and demolished in 1940: fragments of wooden buildings, a wooden well originally located in the courtyard edifice, along with large amounts of clay and glass vessel fragments. Diggings at the southern frontage of the square unveiled fragments of wooden pipes running along north‚Äìsouth and northeast‚Äìsouthwest directions. During an excavation running through the middle of the place, elements of the foundations of the former Old Town Hall have been found. Most interesting discoveries were made during a 2010 archaeological campaign, realized prior to the launching of reconstructions linked to Bydgoszcz Urban Revitalization Plan. These excavations unveiled well-preserved foundations of the former gothic town hall (e.g. vaulted cellars) once standing in the middle of Old Market square, basements of the town hall tower and merchant stalls. In addition, traces of settlement dating back to the 12th century and elements of Iron Age Pomeranian culture period have been found. =Jagiellonian period (1346-1772)= The original buildings of the Market Square were made of wood. Residential brick buildings do not appear before the 15th century. The Gothic brick edifices from the end of the 15th century were expanded with Baroque features in the 17th century and rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century with Eclectic and Art Nouveau fa√ßades. The oldest element preserved in the vicinity of the Market Square can be found at the back of the house at Farna Street 6: it is a stone tablet with a Latin carving, displaying the date (1593) of the building and the initials of the owner -Bartosz KrƒÖpiewski-, city councilor and mayor of Bydgoszcz between 1599 and 1603. Presumably, the first town hall, made of wood, was built in the 14th century at the centre of the market place. During the following century, it was replaced by a Gothic brick edifice. After its burning in 1511, a construction of a new town hall started, according to the design of master Jan from Gda≈Ñsk. It was completed around 1600, and featured a Renaissance high building with a tower, which was the pride of the city. Documented sources report the start of a construction in 1523 of a water supply network in the city, thoroughly modernized after 1541 by pipe-master Walenty from Bochnia. Wooden pipes were laid on the surface of the Market place and four public water wells built, probably connected with waterworks. During the second part of the 17th century, together with the downturn and depopulation of Bydgoszcz, the water supply network was neglected, but it partially fulfilled its role until the 19th century. At the beginning of the 17th century, at its heyday before the Polish partitions period, chronicler Wojciech ≈Åochowski described Bydgoszcz as follows: \\"The whole city is girdled by a wall, there is a high tower at the forefront of the market, from 1600, neatly set, and the town hall is decorated with brick. Brick houses, tiled roofs and water splashes compose the neatly decorated market\\". St. Ignatius of Loyola Church, ca 1895 In 1617, a permanent community of Jesuits was established in the city, thanks to the support of inhabitants and the action of Father Jan Kuczborski, Bishop of Che≈Çmno since 1614. They received ownership of several tenements standing at the Market Square, where they rebuilt a residence and a school. Thanks to many funding (Bydgoszcz city council, bishop Kasper Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski, the Polish Chancellor and Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, Bydgoszcz Starosta), the Jesuit community expanded its facility. The area is delimited today by the Old Market Square to the east, Farna Street to the north, Jezuicka Street to the west and Nied≈∫wiedzia Street to the south. Between 1637 and 1649, along the western frontage of current Old Market place was built the Holy Cross church, adorned with two towers in 1655 and 1695. In 1653, the residential building was completed; in 1780, it housed a high school, elevated to the rank of Jesuit College. The ensemble also featured a theater hall for cultural activities, which had been used till the Municipal Theater was created in 1814. The complex was gradually expanded and embellished throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, and became at the time the hallmark of the place and the entire city. In 1804, the church was re- consecrated as St. Ignatius of Loyola Church in Bydgoszcz. During that period, the Old Market Square witnessed multiple visits of high-ranked Polish officials. Until 1656, those dignitaries, while in the city, stayed at the castle and the retinue rented rooms in houses downtown. Among the most famous visitors, one can cite: * W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço; * Casimir IV Jagiellon; * Sigismund I the Old, who chaired the Sejm gathered in Bydgoszcz in 1520; * Stephen B√°thory, who stayed three months in 1577. From October 26 to November 6, 1657, the Jesuit college in Bydgoszcz housed negotiations between John II Casimir Vasa and the Elector of Brandenburg Frederick William, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Bromberg on the Old Market. At the time, the place was mainly used as a city market square, as originally designed at the establishment of Bydgoszcz in 1346. This scheme had been identical in all cities ruled by German town law, with slight variations (Magdeburg rights, Kulm law). Several fees were charged: * fees for market trade, one of the city's sources of income during fair market; * customs duty on salt, herring and hops, for the Starosta, the w√≥jt (head of town) from the middle of the 17th century and for the city from 1526; * fees for location and paving. In the Middle Ages, Bydgoszcz market only operated on Saturdays, but in the middle of the 18th century, it stood also on Tuesdays. In addition to the market, larger commercial fairs were organized, as there were no major restrictions for external buyers. On December 17, 1484, king Casimir IV Jagiellon granted Bydgoszcz the right to organize three fairs during the year: on Saint Agnes day (January 21), on Saint Giles day (September 1) and on Saint Martin day (November 11). Sigismund II Augustus allowed a fourth fair in 1555, for the Octave of Corpus Christi. Before 1669, two more days were granted to the city: on Saint Anthony day (June 13), and Saint Francis of Assisi (on October 4). Although in the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century the frequency of trade events in Bydgoszcz was the largest in Poland, local activity did not reap the benefits of the situation, in that the economic decline of the city had already started. =Prussian partition period (1772-1920)= After the First Partition of Poland, Kingdom of Prussia seized Poland and Bydgoszcz, drawing up an exact inventory of the city. On a detailed map realized by geometer Greth in 1774, properties on the Market Square are, by and large, the same as those currently standing, apart from a few plots not built at the time, at the corners with Teofil Magdzi≈Ñski street and with Farna Street. In the last quarter of the 18th century, there was no more parcels left: on the corner with John II Casimir street was constructed a large building, dedicated to host the Netze District authorities and the Court of Appeal. The entire western frontage, formerly owned by the Jesuits, was taken over by the Prussian state. In 1788, the first artificial lighting system in the city was installed on the market, replacing superannuated street oil lamps (in 1806, there were still 97 oil lamp posts operating in Bydgoszcz). Statue to Frederick III on the market place, 1910 At the beginning of the 19th century (Napoleonic Wars), the Old Market Square was the location where important \\"political\\" speeches were made: on December 6, 1806, an anti- Prussian uprising was publicly proclaimed, and on 19 February 1807, a decree supporting the Duchy of Warsaw was solemnly read. Today's Provincial and Municipal Public Library building then housed the seat of Bydgoszcz Department and the ex-Jesuit college hosted the main school of the region. The Duchy of Warsaw ceased to exist in 1812, and Bydgoszcz was incorporated anew into the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1830 and 1834, the Prussian authorities demolished the remains of the old town hall which was standing up in the middle of the actual square: municipal offices were moved to the tenement house at D≈Çuga street 37 (today's Ratuszowy hotel). In 1817, a royal gymnasium was opened in the premises of the former Jesuit college; the high school has been relocated in 1878 to its current place at Plac Wolno≈õci. Since 1878, the mayor of Bydgoszcz has always been inhabiting the late Jesuit college building. On an 1834 town plan, 31 individual estates were listed, 9 in the southern frontage, 5 in the western (plus the Jesuit church), 9 in the northern and 8 the eastern. In the middle of the 19th century, a new street, Jatki Street, was cut out in the north-eastern corner of the place, connecting with Grodzka Street. On June 18, 1848, following a violent storm, the Baroque steeple of the towers on the Jesuit church were destroyed. They were initially covered with cone-shaped roofs then rebuilt with Neo-Gothic features from 1880 to 1882. At the same time, the church fa√ßade was also reconstructed. In 1859, the City Council decided to erect a monument to Frederick the Great on the Market place. At the cornerstone laying ceremony on October 21, 1861, highly distinguished guests were present, among whom the King of Prussia William I and his son the prince Frederick III, both accompanied by their wives Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Victoria. The monument was unveiled in January 1862, and the event was again attended by the Prussian heir to the throne, Frederick III Hohenzollern, together with his wife Victoria. On October 4, 1909, another sculpture was unveiled on the square: Children playing with goose or The Well (). This fountain with a well, realized by sculptor Karol Kowalczewski, has been funded by Alfred Kupffender, owner of the pharmacy \\"Under the Golden Eagle\\" (), located on the north-west corner of the place. Advertising for Kupffender's pharmacy, 1903 In Prussian times, the Old Market Square was still the main municipal market area. Crowdy fairs were held there four times a year, and regular market every other week. Through all the 19th century, a thorough reconstruction of almost all tenements of the market place was carried out, applying Neoclassical forms until the 1850s, followed by Eclectic style made of a mix of historicism elements. In the second half of the 19th century, a few houses were demolished in the northern and southern frontages, for reconstruction purposes, replaced by buildings with Neo- Renaissance facades. The same movement happened at the beginning of the 20th century, where Art Nouveau style was applied (e.g. tenement at No. 20). In 1888, streetcars were stationed on the Old Market: initially horsecars, then electric trams (since 1896). Two of the three tramlines of the city were at the time passing through the place. These were: Red Line (from Bydgoszcz train station G≈Ç√≥wna to Bydgoszcz WƒÖskotorowa in Grunwaldzka street) and Green Line (from Gda≈Ñska Street to Strzelnica stop in Toru≈Ñska Street). =Interwar period (1920-1939)= On January 20, 1920, on the Old Market, in front of the Jesuit church, took place the ceremony celebrating the rebirth of the Polish state, 148 years after the first Prussian partition, in the presence of Polish army troops. The statue of Frederick the Great had been dismantled by German citizens and transported to neighbouring Pi≈Ça at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1923, in the house at No. 2 was established the Regional Museum named after Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski. Likewise, the Netze District building was converted in 1908, into the Provincial and Municipal Public Library (building at No. 24). Interwar period did not bring much new changes in the aspect or the role the Old Market square. The traditional market were still held here on Tuesdays and Saturdays. For once, changes appeared in other city places: a market was held every other day at the Old place, at the New Market Square (), at Plac Pozna≈Ñski and Piastowski Square. The commercial heart of Bydgoszcz then comprised the Old Market square, Gda≈Ñska Street, parts of Dworcowa Street and Theatre square, where shops and department stores were concentrated. In 1936, a new tram line ran through the Old Market Square, the D line, from Gda≈Ñska Street to D≈Çuga street. =Nazi occupation (1939-1945)= After the arrival of occupying forces, dramatic events took place on the Square. In retaliation to Polish population sabotage (as called by German propaganda) perpetrated on September 3, 1939, 50 Bydgoszcz citizens were executed on September 9‚Äì10, 1939 in front of the western frontage of the Old Market Square. All these appalling actions are part of the sadly notorious Bydgoszcz's Bloody Sunday. Bydgoszcz hostages mustered at the Old Market square, 1939 At the beginning of 1940, German authorities began to demolish the Jesuit church, the entire western frontage of the Old Market Square -including the tenement house hosting the regional Museum (at No.2), and edifices at Mostowa street cornering the Brda river. Intended project was to build a new town hall with a National socialist style, as well as widening Mostowa street to create a parade avenue for the Wehrmacht. The church was definitely razed on March 27, and the tenement houses on October 23, 1940: in the action, the fountain-well Children playing with geese was also pulled down. However fragments of the sculpture, deposited in the city garden store, fortunately survived the period of occupation. The statue of Frederick the Great was reinstalled on April 20, 1941, Adolf Hitler's name day, and the Prussian name of the square (Friedrichs-Platz) reinstated. In January 1945, the Old Market Square was at the centre of the combats for the liberation of Bydgoszcz: on January 24, the southern side of the city was captured by the Soviet army (76th Infantry Division) and Polish troops (1st Polish Army and 1st Armoured Brigade). The next day, fights occurred to take over the left- bank of the Brda river. Supported by a motorized company, Germans forces put up a fierce resistance along Gda≈Ñska street. Heavy exchanges of artillery fire happened across the river in the vicinity of Mostowa street: Soviet projectiles damaged the Municipal Theater at Plac Teatralny, while German artillery burned up four tenements standing in the eastern frontage of the Square. =After 1945= In January 1945, in the first days after the liberation of Bydgoszcz, the monument to Frederick the Great was dismantled and melted away. On May 1, 1948, the fountain-well was reinstalled in front of the still ruined Municipal library, while between 1953 and 1956, parts of the eastern frontage were rebuilt. However, the new authorities did not proceed to the reconstruction of the western frontage, owing to the presence of the Jesuit church which did not fit into the new political line. In 1947, markets on the place were finally liquidated, leaving the area for cultural events and demonstrations. Restaurant Kaskada In 1962, after the reconstruction of the downtown bridge over the Brda river, the tram traffic resumed through the square till 1969. Between 1968 and 1969, at the north-eastern corner, razed during the war, a functionalist pavilion hosting Kaskada, a gastronomic restaurant, was erected: its radical style caught the eye among others facades. As for the plot where the former Jesuit church used to stand, city authorities unveiled there on September 5, 1969, a monument commemorating the Struggle and Martyrdom of Bydgoszcz Land (). In 1974, following a ministerial resolution, a revalorization of the Old Town, including the Old Market Square, began. The project aimed at re-organizing the commercial network, the transport network layout and giving back to the shop frontages their historic outline. In the 1970s, the following achievements appeared: * the tenement house at No. 16 hosted Antykwariat Naukowy, an antique shop; * No. 18 accommodated a store selling crystals; * ground floors at No. 20 and 22 were modernized; * a \\"Salon of the Visual Arts Studio\\" was set up in the corner house at No. 27, and cellars converted into a caf√©; * in the cellar at No. 25, Cepelia salon was established. Such changes were also implemented on the eastern frontage of the Square. From 1973 to 1975, tram and vehicles were banned from the place and some outgoing streets converted into pedestrian venues (e.g. Mostowa and Magdzi≈Ñskiego streets). On May 3, 1981, bishop Jan Michalski celebrated a mass for the homeland from the stairs of the library, in front of an audience of 100.000 gathered on the Old Market Square; the reader was Daniel Olbrychski. It was the largest demonstration to support Solidarno≈õƒá trade union in the history of the city, and one of the largest gatherings in Bydgoszcz (the largest one being for the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1999). Main sculpture moved for place renovation in July 2018 After Poland's accession to European Union, a competition was held in 2010 to re- design the western side of the Market, but results did not meet public expectations. On December 10, 2011, the former gastronomic complex Kaskada has been bulldozed. In 2013, the plot has been reconstructed, together with Jatki Street. In autumn 2016, archaeological research started on the square, prior to the renovation of the area. This project planned, in particular, to move the monument 15 m closer to the Bydgoszcz Cathedral, allowing the building of a 35-m long high-tech fountain. The Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Inspector of Monuments, on the rationale of the diggings report, barred the realization of the fountain so as to preserve the foundations on the western frontage (church walls and towers, relics of tenement houses with cellar vaults) over an area of 500 m2. Once the renovation is achieved, the sector will be free of car traffic. In May 2018, the contractor which won the bid for the modernization of the Old Market Square was announced: local firm Betpol, for a budget of 14.3 million PLN. The main part of the works is to be carried out by mid-November 2018, and the project completed by mid-2019. Construction works have started on June 25, 2018. The 18¬∞ East line of longitude runs through the center of the Old Market Square. So far this geographical particular is heralded by a small obelisk set on Mill Island: it is foreseen to emphasize this fact on the pavement of the Old Market, once revitalization works are over. =Naming= Through history, this street had the following names: * 16th-18th century, Ring (); * 1772‚Äì1862, Markt (Hauptmarkt); * 1862‚Äì1920, Friedrichs-Platz; * 1920‚Äì1929, Stary Rynek; * 1929‚Äì1939, Stary Rynek Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski; * 1939‚Äì1941, G√ºnther von Kluge-Platz; * 1941‚Äì1945, Friedrichs-Platz; * 1945‚Äì1949, Stary Rynek; * 1950‚Äì1955, Square of the heroes of Stalingrad (); * since 1956, Stary Rynek. Main buildings =Center part= Until 1834, a town hall has been standing at the middle of the market square, similar to one can see today in Gda≈Ñsk's or Pozna≈Ñ's main squares. In 1515, the new city hall displayed arcades housing stalls where clothes, bread were sold and under which fairs stood. The building decoration, like all city frontages, featured Renaissance style, and owned a clock tower with an alarm bell, two observation galleries and an onion dome. The edifice was standing adjacent to the city guardhouse. This important secular building of the Jagiellonian period was devastated in the 18th century and completely demolished later on by the Prussian authorities: the tower was razed in the first half of the 18th century, and the rest of the town hall between 1831 and 1834. =Northern frontages= House at No.1 1780Gminna Ewidencja Zabytk√≥w Miasta Bydgoszczy. Program Opieki nad Zabytkami miasta Bydgoszczy na lata 2013-2016 Eclecticism and Neo-classicism Here stands the oldest pharmacy in Bydgoszcz, Under the Golden Eagle (), founded before 1590 at the Jesuit monastery. The institution was in possession of Jesuits until 1795. The pharmacy was bought in 1808 by Ludwik Kupffender, the son of the director of a local sugar factory. On October 4, 1909, Alfred Kupffender (who owned the firm till 1921), the fountain Children playing with geese in front of his plot to commemorate 100 years of family business of the pharmacy. The subject with geese is a reference to the geese-market which used to be held in front of his plot. Doctor Kupffender at the time was responsible to run analysis on the quality of the water pumped from the new city water supply station. On the facade, a plaque remembers 55 inhabitants of Bydgoszcz who were shot on September 9, and 10, 1939, at the Old Market Square. The elevation is heavily decorated at each level. Two first floors display rows of windows topped by pediment adorned with floral motifs and coat of arms (1st floor) or a woman head (2nd floor). Both levels have a wrought iron balcony, while the last floor boasts pilasters, festoons on lintels and corbel tables capped by a frieze of rosettes.

A local old book shop, Bydgoski Antykwariat Naukowy, is located on the ground floor of the building. Since 1969, nationwide auctions have been held here. On the fa√ßade, one can notice a plaque commemorating Tadeusz Nowakowski (1917-1996), a Polish writer and journalist, activist in exile, as honorary citizen of Bydgoszcz in 1993. During 1975 renovation works, on the ceiling of a spacious room of the basement, beams with remains of polychrome have been unveiled. Several of them are written dated: 1678 and October 30, 1590. Three beams have been moved for display in the house at No.12, where at the time stood the Wƒôgliszek art cafe. Nowadays,the elevation, stripped from its decoration, features a few lintels or triangular pediments and pleasant ground floor round top openings.

Next landlord was a so-called Wilhelm, a Scot trading agent, Wilhelm Wallace, whose daughter Anna married Micha≈Ç Paulusik, the town councilor and mayor of Bydgoszcz In the late 19th century, the building was owned by the family Vincent until the outbreak of WWI. At that time, the house housed also a large beerhouse, Automat. The colored frontage, without motifs, exhibits neo-classic style.

His wife Anna, n√©e Paulusik, came from ≈Åob≈ºenica. She was the sister-in-law of mayor of Bydgoszcz, Wojciech ≈Åochowski. In the late 17th century, the building was sold a house to Wilhelm Wallace, also owner of No.5 since 1642. Wilhelm Wallace was a Protestant and travelled regularly to ≈Åob≈ºenica to attend service religious ceremonies in the local community of the Unity of the Brethren. The house was ruined during the Great Northern War at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1765, a single- storey tenement house was bought by Antoni Niebieski from Fordon. In turn, in 1789, he sold it for 1200 Prussian thalers to a German merchant, Fryderyk Kuerschner, who was one of the first settlers to dwell belonged in the Netze District. In 1792, the house was auctioned together with the building at Jezuicka Street 4, and bought by a real estate agent, Jan Gabryel Oppermann. In 1798, it changed ownership for 4050 Prussian thalers (Jan Kuhlbrunn) and again in 1801, when Fryderyk Herrmann, a wealthy merchant already landlord of several houses, acquired it. Once divorced, Mrs. Schroer was courted by the count Fryderyk Sk√≥rzewski from Lubostro≈Ñ, who had a high position in Bydgoszcz, then district capital during the period of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1824, the property was purchased by a merchant, Karol Matthies, who had several works realized (extension, additional floors). The current decoration dates back to this period, and some traces of this remodeling are still visible today. Mr. Matthies used the entire edifice for himself, making this building one of the few houses in Bydgoszcz Old Town without an inner yard. Since Karol did not pay the money back for the loans of the extension, his lender the count Miko≈Çaj Hutten-Czapski had to auction the property on February 24, 1831. Eventually the count purchased it to secure his capital. After his death, his two children Franciszek and Antonina Barbara inherited the building. However, they abandoned it, as both had other dwellings to supervise: Franciszek the domain of Bukowiec - north of Bydgoszcz-, his sister Antonina, having married Antoni Sk√≥rzewski, the village of Kretk√≥w near Pozna≈Ñ. In 1835, the Czapskis donated the house to the municipal council, together with a fund for the maintenance of an orphanage. In 1838, the new landlord was a city councilor, Mr Koelbl, a baker, while between 1843 and 1864, the owner was Carl August Franke, a merchant and distiller, who founded the firm CA Franke which main factory is still visible on Mill Island. August Franke had the house rebuilt with a Neo-Renaissance style, as one can appreciate today. Among the following owners were Max Jachmann (1894), a Jewish merchant: following WWI his daughter Frieda moved to Germany after her marriage, as did many other Jewish merchants, owners of the majority of the shops on the Old Market square and along Mostowa street. Since the end of World War II, the building is the property of the Administration of Residential Houses (). From 1990 on, the ground floor has been housing a restaurant. The tenement house is a two-storey building with an attic. The building present frontage was conceived in 1864, but some reconstruction happened in the 1960s. The corners have been added one storey, giving the shape of a tower, with bossage stripes. Upper openings in the corner towers are arched like triforium. The edifice has a flat roof, and the fa√ßades are decorated with simple neo-renaissance motifs. Similarities of decoration can be found at D≈Çuga street 31.

In 1967, the \\"Kaskada\\" gastronomic pavilion has been built on their locations. In 2007, city authorities decided to demolish this edifice, then abandoned, so as to reconstruct the frontages of tenement houses. On December 10, 2011, demolition works started, and in 2013, the plots purchased by local entrepreneur Adam Sowa, were rebuilt on a design by Bydgoszcz GM Architects studio. The buildings now houses a marketplace and several other retail places and offices.

After WWII, some buildings partially collapsed while being reconstructed. Eventually, those four historical houses were demolished and rebuilt again, creating a uniformity among their frontages, though different from the original designs. Houses at No.15 and 17 1953-1956 Neo-classicism In the tenement houses at No.15 and 17, in the late 19th century, Leon Br√ºckmann, a merchant, built a modern department store, which in 1921 became the property of the firm Konfektcyjny S.A. from Pozna≈Ñ, and in 1929 the Dom Towarowy Braci Mateckich ran by brothers Czes≈Çaw and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Matecki. For many years during the 20th and the 21st centuries, bookstores have been standing at this location. To revive Pan Twardowski's legend as a local folklore, the city of Bydgoszcz unveiled on June 2, 2006, a sculpture of him, by Jerzy Kƒôdziora, portrayed as a man dressed like a Sarmatian wearing a kontusz, a cap with a heron's feather, a karabela by his side and the Deal with the Devil paper in his hand. The figure is made of resin with precious metal dust. The statue is animated through three internal engines which allow it to move, turn and wave the hand. The wizard shows himself in the window of the last floor of the house at No.15 at 13:13 and 21:13; the automaton then bows and greets the audience, accompanied in the background by a small light and sound spectacle lasting two minutes.

At No.21, a wine bar () has been operating till the start of WWII. The story goes that Pan Twardowski stayed in this inn in 1560, and also drank wine in the company of the devil in a tavern at Przyrzecze Street 10. The automaton show at No.15 stems from this local legend.

Then in 1895, a new reconstruction was commissioned by Moritz Meyersohn, a clothing retailer. The building at No.25 has been reconstructed during the first quarter of the 19th century, at the initiative of Louis Jacobi, who owned a distillation business and lived at No.27, then listed as FriedrichPlatz 30. During the interwar period, the house, together with the one at No.27, housed a drapery led by Roman Stobiecki, specialized in silk. Neo-classic style frontage at No.23 displays a large round-top window, flanked by bossages, the upper level shows two columns supporting a wrought iron balcony. The last two floors show brick layers and small-scale pediments above the openings. No.25 decoration is more modest, noticeable are the triangular roof and the semi-circular skylight beneath.

It has been rebuilt several times between the 16th and the late 19th centuries. Today's frontage recalls the late 18th century style. Legend has it that French emperor Napoleon stayed in this house on the first floor while traveling to Moscow. From the 1870s to the start of the WWI, landlord was Louis Jacobi, also owner of neighbouring No.25. During the interwar period, the house, together with the one at No.25, housed a drapery led by Roman Stobiecki, specialized in silk. The house displays an inner courtyard, a Mansard roof with wooden dormers and a profiled cornice crowning. Basements still possess preserved gothic styled foundations.

His successor, Theodor Thiel, ran there a clothing and decoration shop from the end of the 1880s till the beginning of the 20th century. From 1993 to 2014, an art caf√©, Wƒôgliszek, was established on the ground floor. Wƒôgliszek originates from the so-called name of one of Pan Tardowski's mischievous friends. The figure of the devil can still be observed on the motifs of the facades, in particular in one of the stained glass windows adorning today's establishment. The tenement owes its present appearance to a thorough reconstruction in the Neo-Renaissance spirit, realized in 1877, according to the design of Gustav Weihe. The facades are topped with an extended cornice on corbels, with a convoluted frieze made of pearled ornaments. The building still possesses gothic cellars, where elements of a 15th-century pub activity have been discovered. Bdg StaryRynek12 3 01-2015.jpgFacade on the market place Bydgoszcz, dom, kon.

In 1901, Sally Schendell, a merchant, had the house rebuilt with today's outlook. At that time, a clothing shop was housed on the ground floor. After WWI and the end of Prussian occupation, a Polish shop of clothing owned by F. Chudzi≈Ñski stood there (1920-1923). In the early 1970s, the Medyk Club was housed in the preserved Gothic vaults of the cellars. It was one of the most popular clubs in Bydgoszcz, in the 1970s and 1980s, especially frequented by bohemian artists, flourishing with various musical forms: jazz, baroque, opera, sung poetry, piano recitals. The club closed in 1996. The present shape of the building originates from a 1901 reconstruction. The frontage giving on the Old Market is peculiarly decorated, with a narrow bay window flouncing out the elevation, capped with plastered bat-shaped gargoyles supporting a tiny balcony. The jagged gable, unique on the square, draws attention.

Emil Gamm was the founder of a soap manufactory, registered at then Markt Platz 79: he commissioned the reconstruction of the old building in 1860. Main eye-catcher of the facade is a middle avant-corps, teeming with symbols and motifs.

Other retailing stores at the time were Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne at Gda≈Ñska Street 15 and Modehaus Bromberg at Gda≈Ñska Street 10. The tenement features the canons of Berlin Secession, very fashionable in the 1910s. Floral motifs, mascarons portraying ugly faces are part of the facade decoration, ornamenting the round bay window, between pilsaters or up to the front gable. A figure of Mercury, god of merchants, appears among the bay window elements.

In return, the Nazis did not manage to erect any new edifice. The frontage was demolished by decision of Werner Kampe, then NSDAP Kreisleiter of the area and, technically speaking, mayor of Bydgoszcz, following the German repression against Bydgoszcz population performed before the Jesuit church in September 1939. The adjoined buildings which were razed, housed, successively the police HQ (from the beginning of the 19th century), the Municipal Savings Bank, and the Regional Museum \\"Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski\\" (1923-1939). Currently, the western frontage of the Old Market comprises the elevation of the town hall building, formerly the Jesuit college between 1644 and 1782. Beside the city hall stands on the place the Monument to Struggle and Martyrdom of the Bydgoszcz. Former Jesuit Church The first Jesuit monks came to Bydgoszcz from the Jesuit College in Pozna≈Ñ in 1616, and were accommodated at the parish church, strongly supported by local authorities (burghers and dean of the Kujawska Chapter). In 1619, the monks founded their residence in the city, with a grammar school next to it; it then developed into a full-fledged Jesuit College in 1647. The construction of the church of Holy Cross was completed in 1649, the northern tower in the 1650s, the southern one in 1695. During the Swedish invasions in the mid-17th century, the ensemble was plundered. A slow reconstruction lasted till 1740. In 1806, the church was dedicated to Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Unfortunately, in mid-June the same year, a violent storm knocked down towers spires: through public contributions they were covered with temporary roofs in 1857, before being rebuilt with a Neo-gothic appearance in 1882. During the inter-war period, the German-catholic-owned church carried out a service in Polish every Sunday at 11.00. In 1925, during a renovation in the Crypt, 86 coffins from the second half of the 17th century were found, including Franciszek Ossoli≈Ñski's, the only son of the grand crown chancellor Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, prematurely deceased in 1648. After the Nazis destruction, the empty space was never re-allocated and the center of the city was left mutilated. A request to rebuild the church was made in 1946. Unfortunately, the wording church was not in line with socialist authorities principles. Other efforts were made in the 1980s, through the Social Committee for Reconstruction, however, the lack of clear consent from the Roman Catholic diocese of Bydgoszcz was always an obstacle difficult to surmount. The Jesuit church was a perfect instance of Polish Palladian architecture. The church had a hall, its portal being incorporated into the western frontage of the Old Market Square. It had two side chapels devoted to Our Lady and Saint Joseph. Interiors displayed a Baroque architecture influence. The church towers, while late additions, boasted magnificent baroque spires. Along with the towers, the portal also underwent a Neo-gothic renovation in the 1880s. In 1850, two paintings by Maksymilian Piotrowski (1813-1875) were installed in the church: Saint Ignatius Loyola at the main altar and Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the altar of the right chapel. Our Lady's chapel was decorated with a painting by Antoni Procaj≈Çowicz (1876-1949) and the interior of the church was decorated with the works of Poznan sculptor W≈Çadys≈Çaw Marcinkowski. Some elements of the former Jesuit church are still preserved in other Polish sacred buildings: * Maksymilian Piotrowski's Saint Ignatius Loyola stands now in the Jesuit church of Jastrzƒôbia G√≥ra; * Maksymilian Piotrowski's Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary can be found in St Peter's and St Paul's Church of Bydgoszcz; * a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, some benches and confessionals, and the main cross of the main altar (dated 1806) are located in Bydgoszcz Cathedral; * Saint Joseph's and Saint Aldabert's altars, a candle holder and a tabernacle are housed in St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz; * Saint Anthony of Padua's altar and a pulpit now stand in the Church of Saint of Padua in Bydgoszcz.

In the 17th century, the building contained apartments, a school with four or five classes, a hall adapted to performances of the school theater during school and church ceremonies, and a music office for members of the school orchestra. The construction works were handled by Jesuit builder Wojciech Przyby≈Çkowicz. The first extension of the college has been carried out in 1696, funded by Jan Stefan Komorowski from Malbork, brother of Wojciech, then rector of the Jesuit College in Bydgoszcz (1688-1689). Follow- on works were performed during the periods 1697-1702 and 1705‚Äì1709, under the direction of Wojciech G≈Çaznowicz. Last major re-buildings occurred from 1726 to 1740. The college, together with the Jesuit church formed one of the most impressive building ensemble in Bydgoszcz. It was not only the highlight of the city, but also an attraction for various dignified visitors: in 1657, were accommodated here king John II Casimir Vasa with his wife, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and prince of the Kingdom of Prussia with his wife Luiza, as well as officers and generals of the Swedish and Russian army during armed conflicts in the centuries. At the dissolution of the Jesuit order in 1770, the building was used as a German gymnasium. Under the Duchy of Warsaw rule, a Main Department School (1808-1812) then a faculty school (1812-1815) have been housed there. At those times, the establishment received the visit of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Tadeusz Czacki, while having as students, among others, Stefan Florian Garczy≈Ñski, a poet and friend of Adam Mickiewicz, growing up with relatives at the Sk√≥rzewski Palace in Lubostro≈Ñ. After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw and Bydgoszcz's integration into the Kingdom of Prussia, the former college housed anew a German, classical royal gymnasium (1817-1878). In 1879, buildings were purchased by the city to become the seat of the city authorities. The design of the reconstruction works to fit the city assembly was realized by councilor Wilhelm Lincke with brick master Albert Rose and carpenter Heinrich Mautz. This renovation, apart from changing the fa√ßade style, modified also the internal layout of the rooms, adapting it to the needs of the office. The unveiling ceremony of the mayor's precincts took place on December 19, 1879. As a result of the succeeding reconstructions of 1697-1702 and during the 19th century, the building has lost its original Baroque character. The current edifice is made of brick and plaster. It has a basement plus two stories: its footprint is an elongated rectangle with two avant-corps with a side wing behind the eastern frontage. Elevations on the square reflect neo-classicism, with eclectic stucco motifs. Some rooms are barrel vaulted. The main entrance may appear modest for such an edifice, the main reason being that the building was never supposed to be visible directly from the square: only the successive demolitions of 1940 made it accessible via the marketplace. From 1994 to 1996, a major overhaul occurred, together with a modernization and an extension of the eastern side wing. On April 19, 2017, a clock has been unveiled on the facade of the building. Bydgoszcz town hall has been listed on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List (N¬∞A/309/1) since 1992. Two plaques can be noticed on the walls of the city hall: * on the northern side, a commemoration of the 600th anniversary of the foundation of Bydgoszcz, 1346-1946 (unveiled in 1996); * on the eastern wall, a plaque celebrating the anniversary of the liberation of the city from Nazi occupation (1950).

The author was Piotr Triebler, a sculptor from Bydgoszcz. This commemorative plaque survived until the erection of another monument. Stamp of Nike monument in Bydgoszcz, 1964 In 1963, a competition for a monument dedicated to the Bloody Sunday's victims was announced. The selected project, by Wac≈Çaw Kowalik, portrayed the figure of Nike standing on top of a high obelisk, decorated with bas-reliefs. Nike's right, lowered hand, held a naked sword, in her left she raised a bouquet of flowers. The monument was designed to be erected on the Old Market Square in front of the building library. Eventually, Polish 1968 March events pushed the state authorities to revise their view on such a commemoration, and the monument was never created. However, in its place, Bydgoszcz received a monument designed originally to celebrate the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto, which did never stand in the capital in this time of unrest, Polish United Workers' Party avoiding to celebrate martyrdom, in any forms. In addition, giving this memorial to Bydgoszcz was a way to abide by the will of the inhabitants since 1946, to fill the lost of the bulldozed western frontage (in 1940) on the Old Market Square. In the end, the never- realized Nike's monument only survived on a Polish post stamp issued in 1964, piece of a series on Monuments to Struggle and Martyrdom. The ceremony of unveiling of the former Warsaw ghetto monument was held on September 5, 1969, on the 30th anniversary of the occupation of Bydgoszcz by Nazi soldiers, in presence of the chairman of the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites (), the minister Janusz Wieczorek, the head of the city council Kazimierz Maludzi≈Ñski, and many representatives of local authorities, political parties, as well as numerous inhabitants. The monument stood at the very place where the public executions took place in September 1939. Around the memorial was set a fence made of 80 large sandstone blocks, on which were engraved all the places of struggle and martyrdom of the population of the Bydgoszcz territory. The author of this sculpture was Franciszek Masiak from Warsaw, Bydgoszcz architect Jerzy Winiecki designed the architectural environment of the place. Besides, the full project planned to build a Museum of Combat and Martyrdom, collecting documents of Nazi crimes, on the area of the former western frontage, in front of the town hall: this scheme was never accomplished. At the beginning of the 1990s, beside the monument, four concrete plinths carrying bronze plates were placed: * the first one to inform that on September 9, and 10, 1939, 40 hostages have been executed on the site on the order of the German military commander of Bydgoszcz; * the second and third plaques had the 40 names engraved; * the fourth bore the inscription: The monument to the Struggle and Martyrdom commemorates the memory of Polish citizens from Kuyavia, Pomerania and Che≈Çmno regions killed and murdered during World War II in 1939-1945. The political changes after 1989 added new plaques to the memorial, to commemorate the victims of the Stalinist terror. By the end of 1995, six new tables to the national memory were set by several associations. In the end, the monument was modified in 1993, with the author's accord, by adding a cross in the hand of one of the characters. On August 26, 2007, the 80 plaques surrounding the memorial were moved to the Church of the Holy Polish Martyr Brothers in Bydgoszcz (), located at Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko street 3. The monument portrays a group of people symbolizing martyrdom and struggle. It evokes the expression of pain and protest, and at the same time the struggle against tyranny and genocide. The bronze sculpture is high and weighs more than . It stands on a granite pedestal. The cast of the sculpture was carried out in the Factory of Technical Devices of Gliwice ().

The author was a sculptor, Karol Kowalczewsky, whose name appears at the bottom of the sculpture. The commissioner was Alfred Kupffender, the owner of the pharmacy Under the golden eagle (), who intended to celebrate the 100th anniversary the Kupffender's family business. The sculpture was set on the Old Market Square, in front of the entrance to the pharmacy. After its destruction in 1940, Franciszek G√≥rski, a warehouse manager, rescued many of the bronze fragments, preventing them to be melted away for war purposes. After WWII, the reconstructed fountain was unveiled on May 1, 1948, at the Old Market Square in front of the library. The sculpture is made of bronze and depicts two children: a girl and a boy, playing with a goose. It rests on the top of a stone pedestal which base stems from the fountain bowl. Both the pedestal and the bowl are made of shell limestone. Water flows out of holes in the plinth, as well as from the fountain bowl itself down to the tank below. The current design reflects the preserved original form from 1909. Between September and October 2014, the sculpture has undergone a thorough restoration.

He was nicknamed the 'Bomb Man from Gladsaxe' (Bombemanden fra Gladsaxe) and 'Mystical X' (Det mystiske X). Of his nine bombs, five detonated. Four people were injured from the blasts, including himself, though no-one was killed. The bomb streak created fear among local residents, which were further bolstered by numerous phone and letter threats. Kristensen placed his first bomb in S√∏borg on 4 August 1977. The most spectacular location of one of his bombs was in a sandbox at a school in Gladsaxe on 11 November 1977. The bomb was buried in the sand and connected to a toy, which was discovered by a child. It did not go off because its battery fell out of the assembly. At a communist rally on 1 May 1978 in F√¶lledparken, a bomb went off between Kristensen‚Äôs hands, causing him to lose three fingers on his right hand. He was then arrested. During his trial he claimed that he had no political motives. Doctors described him as intelligent and with no mental issues. On 16 March 1979, Kristensen was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released on probation in September 1981, later graduated as a chemist and got married. Allan Steen Kristensen died from heart problems in 1997, at the age of 38.

Main purpose  The main purpose of the organization of the Sanctuary is to ensure the preservation, normal development, reproduction and sustainable use of the ecosystem of wetlands of international significance, flora and fauna, especially for waterfowl and their habitats, rare plant species and their habitats. The specially protected objects of the Sanctuary area are the unique wildlife and water-swamp flora of the ecosystem of the Arax wetlands.  Rare Species  The Khor Virap water-swamp ecosystem is distinguished by the rare species of flora and fauna, which are endangered to disappearance. In this area and its surroundings, there are such rare species as Falcaria falcarioides, Inula aucheriana, Sonchus araraticus, from the Chenopodiaceae species - Alhagi pseudoalhagi, Amberboa iljiniana, Tamarix octandra and so on. = Falcaria falcarioides = The Falcaria falcarioides are species being in a critical state. They grow in the lower mountainous belt, on the height of 800‚Äì900 meters above the sea level, on saline soils, in marshlands and moist meadows. Flowering in June, fruiting in July. = Inula aucheriana = Inula aucheriana is endangered species. Perennial herb 15‚Äì60 cm, usually covered by chondrose verrucose tubercles. Rhizome nodose. Leaves slightly fleshy. Capitula 5‚Äì8 mm in diameter, gathered in lax raceme. Ligulate flowers with 1‚Äì4 staminodia. Achenes glabrous or sparsely pilose. Grows in lower mountain belt, at the altitudes of 800‚Äì1100 meters above sea level. Flowering from July to August, fruiting from August to September. = Tamarix octandra = Tamarix octandra is an endangered species. It is a tree with a height of 2‚Äì2.5 meters, with a yellow-brown peat. It grows in the lower mountainous belt, at a height of 700‚Äì1100 meters above sea level. It flowers in May and fruits in June.  Importance  The Khor Virap water-swamp area is of great importance as a habitat for a number of watering and waterfowl birds and as a resting place during the seasonal flight of birds. In particular, marbled duck (Marmaronetta angustirostris) and white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala) live here among the world-endangered birds, while the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) during the flight. Khor Virap state sanctuary Small Phalacrocorax pygmaeus, gadwall (Anas strepera), black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta) and bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) live in this territory among the species registered in the Red Book of Armenia. Great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), great egret (Ardea alba), Eurasian spoonbill or common spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus),greylag goose (Anser anser), common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna),northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), Levant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes), short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus), red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), Chettusia gregaria, Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), woodchat shrike (Lanius senator) and barred warbler (Sylvia nisoria) live here among rare and disappearing birds. The territories with the above-mentioned preconditions are considered as the areas subject to the priority inclusion in the list of moist areas of international importance of the Convention (Ramsar, 1971) on ‚ÄúMoist Territories having International Importance, mainly as Habitat for waterfowl birds‚Äù. In addition to the birds, the bats of the Red Book of Armenia, i.e. Mehely's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus mehelyi), the Levant barbastelle (Barbastella leucomelas) and the Schreibers' long-fingered bat, search for food here in the hot months of the year.Red book of Armenia The water-swamp area creates a unique moist microclimate that is evidenced by dry climatic conditions during the summer drought and even in winter when the green color of the water-swamp flora gives a special beauty to the environment. Thus, the Khor Virap water-swamp area is distinguished by its high ecological, scientific and recreational significance, the loss of which, in particular, as an area for waterfowl birds, will cause irreversible damage to Armenia's biodiversity.

He was governor of R√©union from 1865 to 1869 under the Second French Empire, and governor of Cochinchina from 1871 to 1874 under the French Third Republic. He negotiated a treaty with the Emperor of Vietnam that opened up the country to French commerce and ceded territory in the south to France. Life =Early career (1813‚Äì54)= Marie-Jules Dupr√© was born on 25 November 1813 in Albi, Tarn. His father was an army officer. He attended the √âcole Navale and graduated in 1831 as a midshipman. In 1847 Dupr√© was promoted to lieutenant commander. He fought in the Antilles between 1848 and 1851. =Commander and Admiral (1854‚Äì71)= Dupr√© was promoted to commander in 1854. He fought in the Crimean War, then served in the expeditions to Syria and Saigon. In 1861 Dupr√© concluded a commercial treaty with Radama II, King of Madagascar. He was Governor of R√©union from 1864 to 1869. As governor of R√©union he was always helpful to scientific researchers, and in return the Madagascan fruit bat (Eidolon dupreanum) was named in his honour. In 1867 he was promoted to rear admiral. In 1870 Dupr√© participated in the French blockade of Chinese and Japanese ports. The French were trying to keep these ports closed to the Germans. Dupr√© was present at the Tianjin Massacre. =Cochinchina (1871‚Äì74)= Dupr√© was Governor of Cochinchina from 1 April 1871 to 16 March 1874. The French were recovering from the Franco-Prussian War, saw little value in the colony of Cochinchina and were against expanding their colonial empire. Dupr√© disagreed, and saw great potential for France in Vietnam. He strengthened the Native Affairs Service, promoted primary education and introduced compulsory vaccination. He established new schools including the Coll√®ge de Stagiaires, in which Annamese officials were trained for the French administration. He preferred to avoid major changes to the local laws, based on the Chinese system, since this could cause unrest and possibly revolt. Despite several requests by Dupr√© the French government did not want to further extend their power in the region. In 1873 the Vietnamese objected to use of the Red River route to China by the French trader Jean Dupuis. Dupr√© ignored government instructions and dispatched Francis Garnier with a naval force to Hanoi, where it captured the Imperial Citadel of ThƒÉng Long. Dupr√© was concerned that British and German enterprises on the China coast would intervene to block French access to China via Tonkin. He seems to have given Garnier the mandate of attempting to establish a colonial base in Tonkin, but his written orders did not include instructions to this effect since that would have been against French official policy. After the initial success Garnier was killed and the expeditionary force returned from Tonkin. Dupr√© next dispatched Paul-Louis-F√©lix Philastre to negotiate an treaty with the Emperor of Vietnam, T·ª± ƒê·ª©c. In 1874 T·ª± ƒê·ª©c ratified the treaty, under which the French could trade with Haiphong, Hanoi and Qui Nh∆°n, a step towards annexation of the whole of Vietnam ten years later. The treaty ceded the southern provinces of Vƒ©nh Long, Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc and H√† Ti√™n to the French. =Last years (1874‚Äì81)= The French government disapproved of Dupr√©'s views and actions and recalled him to France. He was maritime prefect of Rochefort, Charente-Maritime and then of Toulon. He retired in 1878. Dupr√© died in Paris on 8 February 1881.

R. Burleigh, was an artist and lithographer in Troy, New York who drew and published panoramic maps. His business has been identified as Burleigh Lithograph Company or Burleigh Lithograph Establishment. He produced views of approximately 280 locations of which 120 have been established as his while the others include work by other artists. The Library of Congress has 163 panoramic city plans produced by Burleigh. State and local archives in New York may contain even more of Burleigh's views. He was listed in an 1883 city directory for Troy as a civil engineer and become a lithographer and view publisher by 1886. The period of his greatest productivity of prints continued until 1890. Burleigh was born in Plainfield, Connecticut. One of his lithographs is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum collection. The Boston Public Library and Library of Congress also have examples of his lithographs in their collections. Burleigh's drawings were made into lithographs and include the name of each locality in an artistically stylized font as well as a listing of local landmarks. The designs were copyrighted. Some of the lithographs he published from earlier than 1886 and later than 1889 indicate they were published by Burleigh and copyrighted by his business but drawn by someone else. His grandfather was the principal at Plainfield Academy in Connecticut. Burleigh graduated from Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science. J Lyth J Lyth was an engraver who worked Burleigh before Burleigh drew and published his own perspective maps of small towns in New York, Massachusetts and other areas in the northeastern United States.

Life Widenmayer first attended the St. Anna-Gymnasium in Augsburg. After graduating from high school, he became a scholarship holder of the Maximilianeum Foundation in 1858 and began to study law at the University of Munich, where he became a member of the Arminia/Algovia Fraternity in 1855. He later moved to the University of Heidelberg, where he received his doctorate in 1863. In July of the same year, Widenmayer was elected mayor of Lindau. On June 4, 1870, he was elected second mayor of the city of Munich by the newly elected municipal council as deputy to Alois von Erhardt. After Erhardt resigned, Widenmayer succeeded him on 16 February 1888. He held this office until his death (suicide by shooting) in March 1893. Tomb The tomb of Johannes Widenmayer is located at the Old Southern Cemetery in Munich (Neu Arkaden Platz 88 near field 41). The tomb was designed by Hans Gr√§ssel. Anton Weigel created the model of the bronze elements by the sculptor Anton Pruska. Deeds Widenmayer's term of office was marked by the rapid increase in the population in the course of industrialisation. His short period of office included the reform of the city's elementary schools, the construction of the alluvial sewage system, the incorporation of Schwabing, Bogenhausen and Neuhausen in 1890 and the founding of the market Wiener Markt. Honors Just three years after his death, the street √Ñu√üere Isarstra√üe in Munich, which had just begun to become a magnificent avenue, was renamed Widenmayerstra√üe in his honour.

It is also known as Union Bank of Australia (former), Weymouth House and Hesley Gallery. The property is owned by The Trustee for Union Bank Property Trust (Private). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Union Bank of Australia was established in Orange in 1857 in temporary premises and in 1858 opened in the present building. It was first bank in Orange. In April 1862 the business of the Union Bank was taken over by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. It would be after this year that the building was acquired and used as a Police Station. In 1874-75 buildings for the Police Department were under construction in Byng Street not far from the Court House. It was after this date that Mr T. H. Richards conducted a school in this building called Weymouth House. In 1893 Mr Richards transferred his school and the building became a Girls School called Dombrane College. After closing as Queen's College in about 1911-12 the building then became a boarding house conducted by Miss Hawke and her mother. After the boarding school it was used as residential flats.Letter to Heritage Council 25.3.1980 In February 1980 the Heritage Council was advised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) that the Former Union Bank was under threat of demolition. A Section 130 Order was placed over the building on 29 February 1980. A formal notice under Section 132 was subsequently made by the owners of the building with the intention to demolish the building. After taking into consideration the views of Orange Council and the owners of the building an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the building on 18 April 1980 in an effort to find a suitable use for the building. In August 1980 the Department of Public Works inspected the property and advised the building was significant for its historic and streetscape value and was suitable for re-use as professional offices or residential/commercial use. In 1981 the property was sold and a loan and grant was made available to the owners for the restoration of the building. On 11 February 1983 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Building with classroom attached The building comprises a two-storey rendered brick and iron-roofed main building with a later single-storey brick classroom or hall at the rear, added during the period of school occupancy of the building and perhaps contemporary with the Federation style porch of timber construction added to shelter the principal entry to the main building. Outbuildings at the rear include a separate kitchen-house and a stables block with later garage addition, the latter original internal details such as the horse \\"boxes\\" and wooden cobble floors. The bank building proper is of simple and austere Victorian styling, its facade enlivened only by decorative lintels, keystones and sills to the window openings. Internally the building is also very simply and economically fitted with none of the elaboration usually found in major commercial premises of the period. Original doors, architraves and skirtings, fireplace surrounds and main staircase survive but are simple and basic in design.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 21.3.1980 = Modifications and dates = Rear view The following modifications have been made to site: *1858main two-storey building constructed *1880ssingle storey building at rear constructed *1981Heritage Council approval given for conversion and restoration of buildings *1983Heritage Council approval given for use of ground floor for restaurant purposes *1985Heritage Council approval given for the stratification into 3 titles ad change of use of the property *1988Heritage Council approval given for new fire escape, firehose reel, exit lights and emergency lighting *1992Heritage Council approval given for replacement of portico, and interior alterations.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and George McRae and built from 1923 to 1931. It is also known as Orange Mental Hospital. The property is owned by Orange Ex-services Club. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 March 2006.  History  At the turn of the nineteenth century, institutions for the mentally ill were fast becoming overcrowded. In response to this pressure and the demand for treatment of rural based mentally ill patients, Frederic Norton Manning, Inspector General for the Insane, proposed that a number of hospitals for the mentally ill be established in rural areas. Under his guidance, Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital was built in Goulburn in 1897. In 1898 Eric Sinclair took over from Manning and continued the work of developing rural based psychiatric hospitals with the Morisset Hospital completed in 1910. In 1889, south of Orange was secured and dedicated for the future development of a Mental Hospital yet it was not until 1909 that a general site plan for the Mental Hospital at Orange was developed by Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. The north-eastern buildings within (today's) Riverside or Bloomfield North precinct were designed in 1910, approved for construction in 1922 as the First World War intervened.Scobie, 2015, 7 The construction of the hospital was further delayed until 1923, when work on the first of the hospital buildings began. This was the upper precinct. The construction of the hospital building was assisted by patients as well as local carpenters, labourers and craftsmen. The patients had been transferred from the Gladesville Mental Hospital and in 1923 the Orange and District Illustrated Times noted that many of those patients were discharged due to the improvement of their condition through the work. By October 1925 the Admissions and Convalescent Sections on the eastern part of the site had been completed and accommodated 270 patients from other overcrowded institutions. The official opening by Acting Inspector for the Insane, Dr W. A. Couttie was held in November 1925. Between 1925 and 1931 the wards, Administration, service buildings workshops, kitchen, Recreation Hall and Nurses Home and staff accommodation were constructed on the western part of the site. The hospital was built to facilitate the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century theories of the treatment of the mentally ill propounded by Frederick Norton Manning and later developed by Eric Sinclair. Manning championed a shift from seeing institutions for the mentally ill as asylums or places of confinement to being places for the treatment of the patient's illness where the architecture and setting of the hospital was integral to patients treatment. During his term as Director General for the Insane he worked to further eliminate the stigma of mental illness by ensuring that medical practitioners alone were responsible for scheduling mentally ill patients. Doctors were charged with the administration of the hospitals and the treatment of patients. Sinclair further developed Manning's ideas infusing them with the newer \\"scientific\\" theories on Mental Illness such as the germ theory of mental illness which maintained that mental illness was most responsive to treatment in its early stages. This theory emphasised the benefits of quarantining \\"curable\\" patients from those with more intractable forms of illness. The design of Bloomfield ensures patients perceived to be able to be rehabilitated were accommodated in the eastern area of the site in the Admissions Ward, completed in 1923 and the Convalescent Wards which were finished by 1924. The initial building programme was only completed in 1925. The Government Architect in this period was George McRae (1912-1923). The upper precinct adopted the symmetrical layout as a master plan in the form of an axis with lateral wings in sympathy with the site's topography. The Male Wards were located to the left or north-west of the main axis and the matching Female Wards to the right or south-east of the axis. Administration and management used the lower Riverside precinct for admissions and classification of patients and treatment of those expected to recover in a relatively short period. Those with little hope of recovery were regarded as long-term patients and accommodated in the upper Bloomfield South precinct, according to their gender and illness. The upper precinct's construction commenced in 1922, with the majority of buildings completed by 1935. Patients suffering more debilitating and profound disturbance were accommodated in the nine wards spanning the north‚Äìsouth ridge in the western part of the site (completed between 1927 and 1931).The eastern and western areas were separated by landscaped gardens and playing fields. In each of these areas further separation of patients was accommodated with wards for men and women, separate wards for female and male sick and infirm, and for men and women considered \\"quiet and industrious\\" and those with more challenging and entrenched behaviours - the \\"violent and noisy \\" wards. All the buildings and wards at the hospital were specifically designed to reflect the proportions and style of domestic architecture to ally the impression of being an institution of confinement. The setting in which patients were treated was considered to be of utmost importance and much attention was paid to the planting of both formal gardens and of parklands across the hospital property. Wards were built to take advantage of light and ensure easy access to fresh air. The hospital was planned to be a virtually self sustainable community with patients growing vegetables and fruit and in earlier times tending the dairy and piggery. Like all patients experiencing mental illness, patients at Bloomfield, were committed by law to receive treatment at a metal hospital. In 1900 the classification of those who were able to be committed was expanded to include alcoholics and inebriates with serious behavioural problems. Bloomfield was the first hospital to be licensed to treat these patients. In the 1930s new psychiatric treatments for the mentally ill such as hypnosis, use of bromides, fever therapy, coma therapy and leucotomy were being implemented in the state's hospitals. Bloomfield was well equipped to keep abreast with these new therapies having a purpose built operating theatre included in the schedule of hospital building completed by 1931. Recreational and occupational therapy developed as important forms of treatment at Bloomfield from 1929 and the value of sporting activity was recognised from early on. The first cricket pitch was established near the most northern entrance to the side. During the 1930s this pitch and adjoining area ( in total) was redeveloped as Bloomfield Aerodrome. A second pitch, located on land between t he eastern and western part of the site was developed in 1928. This Cricket Ground became a focal point for patients, staff and visitors over the years. An important addition to the hospital was the construction of two TB Wards in 1934. These Wards were built in response to a decade or more of measures put in place to control the epidemic spread of TB. The Women's TB Ward was located at the eastern end of the Convalescent Section and the Male TB Ward was located at the end of the Male Wards in the western part of the site. Both wards had north-east facing airing yards considered essential to the design of such wards at the time. The wards were unusual in that they were two of the few attached to Mental Hospitals and as such posed the architectural challenge of ensuring patients remained confined and isolated from the broader population while still providing access the therapeutic effects of sunlight and fresh air. The majority of the buildings were created in the period up to 1935. The War years saw characteristic shortages at the hospital including the dearth of male staff members. This was coupled with an influx of patients from Kenmore which was used for military purposes and resulted in overcrowding for the patients and an increasing workload for the mainly female staff. Overcrowding remained a difficulty after the war and there was little progress in the development of effective treatments or the improvement of facilities at the Orange Mental Hospital. During the 1950s new behaviour stabilising drug treatments such as largactil and lithium and the provision of community care to patients were implemented to reduce the demand for mental hospital accommodation. Nevertheless, Bloomfield, as Orange Mental Hospital was renamed in 1954, remained a large hospital with a routine of therapeutic treatments and activities. The emphasis creating links with the local community through sporting and cultural activities was continued at this time with the establishment of a Dramatic Society which involved patients and staff in regular productions. Performances were attended by those associated with the hospital and members of the wider Orange Community. The Society was the precursor to the recently formed, semi-professional Orange Theatre Company. During the 1960s another incentive to promote patient integration into the community was the establishment of a Bloomfield Branch of the Country Women's Association. Patients belonging to the Branch to participate in choral and drama performance and various fund raising activities. In 1965 a nine-hole golf course was established on the site, a third sporting field Pringle Park was established just below the Male Wards and a new laundry complex servicing the Central West area hospitals was built. In 1983 the Richmond Report recommended a major overhaul of the operation of Mental Health Services which focused on separating services for the mentally ill and those with developmental disability and the rehabilitation those with mental illness back into the community with the support of community services. In the mid 1980s the Admission and Convalescent Sections of Bloomfield were \\"removed from Bloomfield and consolidated as the Riverside Centre\\". (2004, NSW Government Architects Office. Preliminary Heritage Assessment). Also around this time an acclaimed clinical community rehabilitation scheme was piloted out of Bloomfield. This program, the elite Housing Integrated Program Support (SHIPS), is still operating in Bathurst and Orange. In 1986 Bloomfield came under the administration of the Central West Health Services and the program of deinstitutionalisation continued, reducing the number of beds available at Bloomfield to 274 and it number of patients to 197 in 1989. A review of the hospital's operations in 1989 recommended that the two storey ward blocks be decommissioned. The wards treating those with dementia were also earmarked for closure in this report. In the early 1990s a new Admissions unit was built, a Short Stay Unit was built and an Aged Care Unit was also built. In 2005 the site was considered for redevelopment which will integrate a new Base Hospital for Orange into the Mental Health Services operating from the site. In April 2009, the Government approved rezoning of of land at Bloomfield to provide land for future urban residential and commercial developments. The land was identified because of its proximity to employment uses such as the Bloomfield Hospital and a new private hospital. The rezoning permits a range of new land uses, including: nearly zoned for special activities for the continued operation of the Orange Agricultural Institute; nearly zoned for low density residential development, with the capacity to yield around 800 dwellings; over across two tracts of land zoned for a range of uses servicing the adjacent medical, recreational, residential and industrial precincts.DoPlanning Annual Report, 63: accessed 16/12/2009  Description  Landscaped grounds Bloomfield Hospital is located on Forest Road in the south-eastern outskirts of the city of Orange. The Hospital comprises two distinct groupings of buildings and their setting of landscaped and park like gardens and playing fields The earliest buildings developed on the site lie on a ridge ( north- south) to the east of the site and comprise the original Admissions Section ( Designed 1910) and Convalescent Section ( designed in the Inter-war period). The Admissions Section comprises a two-storey central administration building built in the Federation Arts and Crafts style and two single storey wards. All these buildings are constructed of face brick, the second storey of the administration block being rendered with stucco and painted. The roof of the administration wing is tiled with terracotta tiles as are the ward buildings. The western side of the administration block features a columned entry porch and adjacent Dutch gables which are edged with stone copings. The ward building also have stone edged gable ends. The wards comprise central dormitories and wings of single room accommodation. Female wards To the south of the Admission section lie the five buildings comprising the Convalescent Section designed to accommodate \\"curable\\" cases away from the influence of more seriously disturbed patients. These buildings are of the Inter War Arts and Craft style of architecture with some Inter War Neo Georgian influence. The Convalescent Section Administration building is of two storeys with a recessed veranda on the front face and a shingled balcony above. This has since been enclosed. The wards are two story brick buildings with wide verandas on the north eastern elevation. The verandas are supported by circular columns. Other buildings on the eastern part of the Bloomfield site include the former Nurses Home 1 (now Tallow Wood Hostel). This two storey brick building is designed in the Inter War Georgian Style featuring a columned portico on the main elevation and an upper level veranda at the rear of the u-shaped building. There are also residences for the \\"Officer in Charge \\" and the \\"Medical Officer\\" as well as another more contemporary residence. There are also two former stable buildings located on the eastern ridge complexes of buildings. Stretching westward from this group of buildings lies an area of lightly treed, open space. The cricket pitch (established in 1928), a series of playing fields (developed in 1938), a bowling green and clubhouse, ( 1960) and a 9-hole golf course are located in this area. This open space was pivotal to the planning of the hospital facility as it functioned to separate different categories of patient. Patients whose behaviour and chances of recovery were low were accommodated in the buildings on the western part of the site and those who were likely to be successfully rehabilitated lived in the eastern part of the site. Recreation room The group of buildings located in the area were constructed between 1927 and 1931. The wards and the Recreation Hall were built in an arc along the highest part of a ridgeline and take full advantage of the therapeutic views to the east over the playing fields and landscaped parklike gardens to the south east of the site. The Recreation Hall ( now Leisure centre) is located at the centre of the arc. Designed in the Inter-war Mediterranean style this building is of rendered stucco, has an arcaded veranda along one side, a flat end facade with a bell niche on the western end of the building. There and there are five male wards to the north and five female wards to the south of the Recreation Hall. The two single storey brick wards either side of the Recreation Hall were for the sick and infirm. The building on the southern side of the recreation Hall retains its original eastern elevation featuring a veranda on three sides overlooking a central garden area. To the north and south of these sick and infirm wards lie mirror image, two storey wards constructed of brick and designed in the Federation Art and Craft style. The northern and southernmost wards in this configuration are constructed of Lithgow brick and are of a low key Arts and Craft style with wide east facing verandas supported on brick piers. All these building were designed to minimise the impression of being institutional buildings. Mortuary chapel Behind the arc of wards, across Canobolas Drive in its original layout, are located administration, service and support buildings including a mortuary chapel, operating theatre and epileptic wards. Directly behind the Recreation Hall is the Administration building and behind that the former Dining Room. These building form the east west axis of this end of the site. The hospital buildings in both parts of the site are set in extensive landscaped, park like gardens. Each ward on the western part of the site has remnant formal ward gardens and hedges are used to define boundaries and spaces.2004 Government Architect's Office. Bloomfield Preliminary Heritage Assessment. Moving away from the wards the gardens give way to park like plantings of trees ( such as the Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), elm (Ulmus procera), pin oaks (Quercus palustris) and poplars (Populus sp.)) and remnant original woodlands vegetation (single apple box, snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) trees). The original layout of the site included a substantial nursery and vegetable garden in the western part of the site along Forest Road. This original garden has been transferred its current site located between the entry gates and the former northernmost men's ward. In 1928 there were also a small dairy and piggery established at the hospital. = Condition = As at 3 March 2005, Bloomfield Hospital retained the integrity of its original layout and underpinning design philosophy as a therapeutic environment for the treatment of the mentally ill. Its original layout, separating different categories of patients over the eastern and western portions of the site as well as within the hierarchy of wards on each site is still clearly evident in as there has been very little new development on the site since the original construction period between 1923 and 1931. The Bloomfield Hospital retained most of its original buildings and significant layout elements. While some of the formal ward gardens are no longer intact the plantings of many of the trees and shrubs throughout the site remain retaining the park-like quality of the grounds. = Modifications and dates = The Following modifications have been made to the site: *1952small brick extension to the Female sick and infirm ward *1958new kitchen block to the south of the original kitchen block *1956Bowling green to the southern end of Pringle Park *1960Bloomfield bowling green clubhouse built *Early 1960sremodeling of male and female ward block on the western part of the site *1969Central Western Area Laundry complex established in the south west of the grounds *1970sfire escapes added to all two storey buildings *1965-89-hole golf course developed on the site- below Pringle Park ( the playing field below the make wards in the western part of the site) *19894 x 16 bed treatment single storey units established in the western part of the site *20043 new units were established - a new Admissions Unit inside the Main Gate on the northwest side of the Crescent, a Short Stay Unit on the south west side of the Crescent near the Chapel  Heritage listing  As at 3 March 2005, the Bloomfield Hospital is of State heritage significance. It has high historic, associative and aesthetic significance as an example of a mental hospital designed according to the philosophy and treatment regimens of the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century. It was the last of the large purpose built mental hospitals in NSW and one of only three built in rural areas. It has remained largely intact with regard to its original intention and layout as little development of the site has occurred since the completion of the original hospital buildings. The hospital has a strong association with Frederick Norton Manning and Eric Sinclair who were pioneers in the treatment and management of mental health in NSW in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries. It is a landmark in the area as a fine ensemble of buildings in a village-like landscape setting and demonstrates through its physical fabric, layout and park-like setting, a humane method for the treatment of the mentally ill that is no longer carried out on such a large scale. Its continual use as a place of treatment for the mentally ill also makes the place significant as does its tradition of promoting a close association with the local community through social, cultural and sporting activities. Bloomfield Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 March 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bloomfield Hospital is of historic significance to the development of NSW as it was one of only three dedicated mental hospitals built in rural NSW. It has been continuously used as a mental hospital and its design demonstrates the evolution of mental health treatment overtime. Its design and setting clearly demonstrate the \\"enlightened\\" Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century theories on the treatment of the mentally ill. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Bloomfield Hospital is strongly associated with Frederic Norton Manning, Director General for the Insane (1876 to 1898) who proposed the construction of the hospital in Orange during his incumbency. Manning was a champion of a more compassionate and enlightened treatment of the mentally ill. The detailed design and construction of the hospital was undertaken by Eric Sinclair another significant figure in the humanisation of treatment of the mentally ill and in pioneering new treatments. The initial sit layout was developed by Walter Liberty Vernon and followed through by his successors in the role of Government Architect. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Bloomfield Hospital in its landscape setting is of high aesthetic significance as for its landmark qualities within the Orange area. These qualities derive from its distinctive tree cover, its ensemble of buildings, gardens and landscape features. The domestic scale of the buildings and their village like layout in the park like setting are an outstanding and intact example of a hospital specifically designed to promote recovery and rehabilitation of the mentally ill. Bloomfield was the last of a series of dedicated mental hospitals designed along these lines in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries and has special and enduring aesthetic values. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bloomfield Hospital has a strong association with past and present patients and staff many of whom came from all over NSW. Bloomfield has been home to many of these people who spent extended periods of their life there. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The built form, layout, landscape setting of Bloomfield Hospital provides evidence of and insight into the evolution of mental health treatment and underpinning theories from the late Nineteenth Century to the present day. Its research value is heightened by the level of integrity and intactness of its original form and layout. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Bloomfield Hospital is the last of a series of major, purpose built mental hospitals set in a park like setting. It continues to be used as a mental health facility and so provides a rare \\"living\\" demonstration of the changes to the treatment of the mentally ill from the Nineteenth Century to the present. It is likely that Bloomfield's operating theatre was a unique addition to mental hospital. Its construction coincided with the pioneering years of psycho surgery in NSW and Australia. It is also likely that the inclusion in the hospital complex of purpose built TB wards for mentally ill patients was also uncommon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Bloomfield Hospital, its built form, layout and setting, provides an outstanding example of the principal characteristics of an early Twentieth Century mental hospital designed as a holistic therapeutic environment.

Background Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore came out of a discussion between Gavin Brown, Martin McGeown and Leckey. They were at a gallery private view in London, and Emma Dexter, then a curator at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), talked to Leckey. He argued that the most exciting art form of the time was the music video, and intrigued, Dexter invited him to make a work demonstrating it. It was later first screened at the ICA.Mark Beasly, Frieze, Issue 136, January 2011. The title, Leckey said, was about the notion that \\"something as trite and throwaway and exploitative as a jeans manufacturer (Fiorucci) can be taken by a group of people and made into something totemic, and powerful, and life-affirming.\\" Synopsis Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore is collaged from tape footage from 70s, 80s and 90s underground dance scene in the UK, including portions of footage from the 1977 Tony Palmer film The Wigan Casino. It starts with the disco scene of the 1970s, touches upon the Northern soul of the late 1970s and early 1980s and climaxes with the rave scene of the 1990s; the mashup soundtrack Leckey created for the film follows the same temporal structure as a soundscape, with him occasionally interjecting dialogue. Notably, at one point, an animated element - a bird tattoo image - appears as if released from the hand of a dancer, then carried into the next shot finds its place on the arm of another of the film's nightclubbing subjects. The film follows a looping structure, bookending itself with a low frame rate time-lapse shot of clouds. Legacy Charlotte Higgins, writing for The Guardian, remarked that \\"Fiorucci changed the game.\\" Jamie xx sampled dialogue from the film, including Leckey reciting the names of fashion brands, on \\"All Under One Roof Raving\\". In July 2018, Leckey's YouTube upload of Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore was temporarily taken down by FremantleMedia, but was reactivated two days later.

He said his dream cast would include Cornel Wilde, Dan Duryea and George Hamilton. The New York Times printed that Vic Morrow and Leonard Nimoy had acquired the movie rights to the play in the issue published November 27, 1962. Leonard Nimoy obtained the rights to film Haute Surveillance directly from Genet, though Genet had no further involvement with the project. The screenplay was adapted by Morrow and his then-wife Barbara Turner. Part of Deathwatch was shot in the nineteenth-century Nevada State Prison, where the actors lived for six months to prepare for their roles. Some of the inmates took part in the production. Release The film was first shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1965 but it was not given a general release nor was it widely reviewed. It was later given a limited release in the US in March 1966. One of the first films to be directly marketed to a gay audience, Deathwatch was quickly buried in the States and never released in the UK. Reception In a review years later, a reviewer for the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that in \\"the feature, adapted from a Genet play, which has been unjustly forgotten for 23 years, Vic Morrow's direction captures a consistent, if not very interesting, mood, and the editing seems ahead of its time in the way flashbacks are inserted. Leonard Nimoy and Michael Forest are the butch guys sharing a cell with nellie Paul Mazursky in this unromantic triangle that's hard to tear your eyes away from, even if it's not very good.\\" References External links Category:1965 films Category:American films Category:1965 drama films Category:Films set in prison Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Films directed by Vic Morrow Category:American films based on plays Category:1965 directorial debut films ","title":"Deathwatch (1965 film)"},{"id":"57959476","text":"Embiran is a 2019 Indian Tamil language realistic thriller film directed by Krishna Pandi, starring Rejith Menon, Radhika Preethi and T.

Life  Henryk Waniek was born in O≈õwiƒôcim, a small town near Krakow that is generally identified in English-language sources by its pre-1945 German name as Auschwitz. The family moved to nearby Katowice in January 1945, and it was there that he later attended school, passing his school final exams (\\"Matura\\") in 1962 and then taking a year out to work in a Katowice book shop. In 1964 he enrolled at the Krak√≥w Academy of Fine Arts. During 1965/66 he studied at the University of Krak√≥w. During this period he was also one of those involved in the (politically unreliable, in the eyes of some) Dyskusyjny klub filmowy \\"Kino-oko\\" (film club) in Katowice (an hour to the west of Krakow), becoming club president in 1966. As a student he came under the influence of BarbarƒÖ and Henryk Ziembicki, known for a fantastical-magical artistic approach. The adjective \\"magical\\" is one he continues to apply to his artistic style. He also joined the Oneiron Group, founded in 1967, and sometimes known as the \\"Spiritual Insights League\\". Other members included Antoni Halor and Andrzej Urbanowicz. Members of the group turned to magic and alchemy as well as the philosophy and religions of the Far East, attempting to access and use for artistic purposes differing levels of consciousness. During the 1960s and 1970s they held regular sessions, made films and distributed \\"New Unpretentious Holy Scripture in Pictures\\" (\\"Nowe Bezpretensjonalne Pismo ≈öwiƒôte w Obrazkach\\") a periodical, published using a duplicating machine and distributed to homes and artists' studios. It took the form of a document wallet containing manuscripts, typescripts, drawings, photographs and recordings. In 1970 he obtained a diploma in poster art and graphic art techniques, studying with professors Tadeusza Grabowskiego and Andrzej Pietsch. After graduating he worked briefly at the \\"State Lyceum of Fine Arts\\" (\\"Pa≈Ñstwowym Liceum Sztuk Plastycznych\\") in Katowice as an art teacher, and as a lecturer at the Art Department of the University of Silesia in Katowice. In 1976 he received an Italian government scholarship for a study trip to Florence. Directly afterwards, he was a recipient of a scholarship from the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York City. In 1980 Waniek relocated away from Silesia. Since then he has lived and worked in Brwin√≥w a short distance to the west of Warsaw, though he has continued to visit Silesia several times a year. In the context of his art, he has been quoted as saying that since moving away he has come to understand Silesia better (\\"Lepiej zrozumia≈Çem ≈ölƒÖsk\\").  Work  = Artist = Henryk Waniek is a surrealist painter. Many of his works feature symmetrical overall designs and / or concentric shapes. He frequently incorporates very traditional features such as windows, drinking vessels, ladders, devils, rainbows and shooting stars. He himself speaks of a \\"magical vision\\" of the world. He expresses himself using traditional oil painting techniques. He also works with different types of drawings involving graphic art and poster art. From time to time he has diversified into the performing arts, designing stage sets. His works have featured in over 100 exhibitions and he has been honoured with various prizes. = Essayist = Henryk Waniek has published several volumes of essays. Topics that engage him include history and philosophy along with religious and mystical studies. He has a continuing fascination with the seemingly endless twists and complexities of the history and culture of Silesia. He is particularly known for his three volumes of essays on Silesia: * \\"Hermes w G√≥rach ≈ölƒÖskich \\" (\\"Hermes in Upper Silesia\\", 1994) * \\"Opis podr√≥≈ºy mistycznej z Oswiƒôcimia do Zgorzelca\\" (\\"Description of a mystical journey from Auschwitz to G√∂rlitz 1257‚Äì1957\\", 1996) * \\"Pitagoras na trawie\\" (\\"Pythagoras on the Meadow\\", 1997) A subsequent work, \\"Wyprzeda≈º duch√≥w\\" (\\"Sale of Ghosts\\", 2007), describes a journey through the region that since the start of the twentieth century has become known as the Sudetenland (\\"Kraj Sudet√≥w\\"). Waniek also writes literary criticism and, since 1971, has contributed regularly to cultural and literary journals. = Novelist = He has also authored four novels: * \\"Dziady berli≈Ñskie\\" (\\"Grandfather from Berlin\\", 1995) * \\"Dziady paryskie\\" (\\"Grandfather from Paris\\", 1998) * \\"Finis Silesiae\\" (\\"The end of Silesia\\", 2003) * \\"Jak Johannes Kepler jadƒÖc do ≈ªagania na ≈ölƒÖsku zahaczy≈Ç o ksiƒô≈ºyc\\" (\\"How Jan Kapler found the moon while travelling to ≈ªaga≈Ñ in Silesia\\", 2015) = Obiter scripta = In \\"Sprawa Hermesa\\" (Der Fall Hermes / \\"The Hermes case\\", 2007) Waniek tells the story of the controversial Prussian Rosicrucian theologian Hermann Daniel Hermes (1734-1807). His collection of poems, short stories and stage miniatures appeared in 2013 under the title \\"Notatnik i modlitewnik drogowy\\" (\\"The travellers book of notes and prayers\\") \\"Cmentarz nie≈õmiertelnych\\" (\\"Cemetery of the undead\\", 2015) is the story of the Szklarska Porƒôba artists' colony. In 1998 Andrzej Titkow made a documentary film about Henryk Waniek under the title \\"Sztuka b≈ÇƒÖdzenia\\" (loosely \\"The wanderer's art\\").  Personal  Henryk Waniek married Joanna Pasiud in 1972. Their son and daughter were born in 1978 and 1985.

It was directed by Shafi and written by Binju Joseph, Shafi, and Sunil Karma. The film stars Bibin George and Prayaga Martin. It was produced by Allwyn Antony, Gijo Kavanal, Sreejith Ramachandran and Zachariah Thomas under United Global United Media. Synopsis The film begins in Bombay with police officers chasing Rudra Nayak, a dangerous terrorist who has been branded as a Maoist. However, his group escapes and secretly arrives in Kerala. The film then introduces Sreekuttan (Bibin George) who is a handicapped mechanic, whose best friend, Bhavyan (Hareesh Perumanna), is also a mechanic. Sreekuttan falls for Shruti (Prayaga Martin) and attempts to woo her with his charm. Unfortunately, Shruti doesn‚Äôt reciprocate, which leaves him devastated. One day Sreekuttan and Bhavyan receive a call to fix a car. The duo tricks the car owner because of his behaviour towards them and makes him push the car. They then leave him there after seeing Shruti and her friend in the distance. Little did they know that the car owner is the new police inspector in town, Rajendran (Kalabhavan Shajohn). When Rajendran realizes that he has been tricked, he gets back at Sreekuttan and Bhavyan. Due to this incident, Sreekuttan is unable to pay medical bills for his father (Indrans), who later passes away. This incident infuriates Sreekuttan. He sets out to confront the policeman, which leads to a fist fight that Sreekutan loses. This series of events makes Sreekutan so angry that he vows vengeance on the cop. In a disturbed frame of mind, he decides to plant a bomb in the cop‚Äôs car with the help of his old friend Unni (Vishnu Unnikrishnan) who is serving jail time for a bombing incident. Though initially reluctant, Unni later agrees to help him make the bomb. He refuses to make it by himself as he promised his mother that he would not make any more bombs. Sreekuttan‚Äôs intention was to hurt the policeman so that he could bear the same pain as him, but Bhavyan‚Äôs intentions were different and he secretly asks Unni to create a deadly omb that would kill the Inspector instead of only hurting him. Amidst all this Rudra Nayak seeks refuge in the village. One night, while the duo enter Rajendran's house and plant the time bomb in his jeep, Rajendran enters the jeep. Sreekuttan sets the time to 45 minutes. They briefly follow the jeep, but then lose it. Rajendran goes to Rudra Nayak's hideout from where he escaped and seizes their weapons. On his way back, he sees Bhavyan standing near his bike with a bottle of alcohol while Sreekuttan is urinating in the bushes. Rajendran dislikes those who drink, as a result, he arrests Bhavyan and takes him to the police station in his jeep. All this time the timer is ticking away. With just a few minutes before the bomb is set to explode, Bhavyan tries to escape using a number of excuses, but fails to do so. The bomb is deactivated when the jeep gets jammed in a gutter allowing Bhavyan to get away. When Sreekuttan realizes that the bomb, didn‚Äôt explode he comes up with another plan. He decides to thrash the policeman. One night, while Rajendran is driving back home, he receives a warning from his superior that Rudra Nayak has threatened to kill him. Amidst all this, Sreekutan sets his plan in motion. He placed a sack on Rajendrans' route. Spotting the suspicious sack, Rajendra investigates, which is when he hears some noises coming from the jungle nearby. He decides to follow the noise and goes deeper into the jungle, where Sreekutan and Bhavyan await. As soon as Rajendra is in range, Sreekutan throws chilli powder at him, blinding him. Sreekutan and Bhavyan then tie him up, beat him brutally and throw him in the well. Immediately after the incident, they both feel guilty and take Rajendran to the hospital. When Rajendran regains consciousness, he thinks that he was beaten up by Rudra Nayak and was saved by Sreekutan and Bhavyan. Rajendran thanks them and apologizes for beating Sreekuttan. Thus, Sreekuttan accomplishes his mission. Shruti then meets him and apologizes for behaving rudely. She thanks him for saving her father Rajendran. She walks away indicating her feelings for him. Meanwhile, Rudra Nayak attacks the police station with his gang and takes back their weapons. He accidentally chooses the jeep with the bomb while trying to escape. On their way, the bomb explodes, killing Rudra Nayak and his group.

Piesse was a leading author and innovator of modern perfume ideas, inventing the concept of notes in perfumery that are still used universally today. He was the co-owner of Piesse and Lubin, a perfume house that created some of the most popular scents of its day.  Education  Piesse studied at University College London.  The Art of Perfumery, and Method of Obtaining Odors from Plants  Piesse's The Art of Perfumery is an important early book about the methodology behind extraction methods and blending in perfumery. It is considered Piesse's \\"opus magnum\\" In the book, Piesse introduces the idea that olfaction can be described in ways that correlate to the musical notes on a diatonic scale. He is credited with creating an \\"odaphone,\\" or a scale related to categorizing and ranking the notes by octave. The Art of Perfumery is also notable in that, in an 1862 edition, Piesse introduced ideas relating to synesthesia and smound. He suggested that sounds and scents are linked in the brain: \\"Scents, like sounds, appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain definite degrees.\\" One of The Art of Perfumery's most enduring legacies is Piesse's popularization of the use of synthetic materials.  Mercutio Frangipani  According to an article titled \\"Making the Synthetic Epic\\" in the journal, The Senses and Society, Andrew Kettler recounted the story of how Piesse, in later editions of The Art of Perfumery, invented the character named Mercutio Frangipani. According to Piesse, Frangipani was a botanist who was on board one of Christopher Columbus' voyages to America, and even supposedly found land by smelling it. There was a 17th-century French botanist named Charles Plumier, who did travel to study the plants in American, and who Frangipani may be based on. The invention of Frangipani was meant to correlate Piesse's perfume practice, particularly a scent called \\"Frangipanni,\\" to the \\"exotic encounters in the Atlantic World.\\" However, the story of Frangipani has since been reprinted in several books on perfume history as fact.  Piesse and Lubin  Piesse and Wilhelm Lubin, \\"an elite Paris manufacturer of perfumes,\\" co-founded Piesse and Lubin in 1855. In \\"Making the Synthetic Epic,\\" Kettler wrote, \\"Piesse...became the premier perfumer on the London scent scene in the 1860s after the publishing of numerous works on the use of flowers for creating perfumes.\\" Piesse and Lubin's laboratory existed at Number 2, New Bond Street in London. Piesse and Lubin created a number of popular perfumes in the late 18th century, including Hungary Water (1873), Kiss Me Quick (1873), Frangipanni (1880), and Vashti (1900). = Mary Celestia = In 2011, anthropologist Philippe Rouja found several bottles of Piesse and Lubin's Bouquet Opoponax in the sand near the shipwreck of the Mary Celestia, a Civil War-era boat that crashed into a reef off of Bermuda in 1864. Rouja brought the bottles to Bermuda Perfumery, a local perfume house established in 1928. The owner, Isabelle Ramsay-Brackstone, had the perfumes analyzed by Osmoth√®que, a scent archive in Versailles. Based on the analysis, Bermuda Perfumery was able to re-create a version of Bouquet Opoponax  References  External links * Category:Perfumers Category:Alumni of University College London Category:19th-century English scientists Category:1820 births Category:1882 deaths Category:English chemists Category:19th-century English writers Category:19th-century British chemists ","title":"George William Septimus Piesse"},{"id":"57960037","text":"Little Women is a 2018 American drama film directed by Clare Niederpruem, from a screenplay by Niederpruem and Kristi Shimek.

MA. 776) is one of three surviving copies of a manuscript originally created in 1524. This manuscript was a letter sent by Giovanni da Verrazzano (1481-1528) to King Francis I of France describing the former's navigation of the East Coast of the United States. Verrazzano was an Italian who lived in France, and he undertook his voyage in Francis' service. The King, prompted by the French mercantile community, charged Verrazzano to discover whether there was a direct passage from the Atlantic to China and Japan. These were important trading partners‚Äîparticularly in silks and spices‚Äî for most European nations. The Codex is considered by scholars to be the most important of the three copies, although there is debate as to how much weight should be given to some of the detail it provides. Over twelve pages, the Codex describes how Verrazzano sailed due west from Madeira in December 1523, and in little more than a month had arrived at North Carolina. From there they journeyed south, towards Florida. This direction was not without danger, as Florida represented the northerly point of the Spanish Empire, and Spanish warships patrolled the sea. Verrazzano then turned northwards again and, hugging the coast, passed Virginia, New Jersey, and eventually New York, where he anchored in what is now New York Harbour. He then continued north around New England, to Newfoundland, where, with provisions running low, he turned eastwards. Verrazzano and crew returned to Dieppe in July 1524. The Codex describes Verrazzano's journey in a far greater degree of detail than the other versions of his letter, which may be because it was originally transcribed by Verrazzano's brother, and then further annotated by Verrazzano himself. It was sent via a series of letters to colleagues of Verrazzano in France and then to Italy, where it then remained undiscovered in a Viterbo library until the early twentieth century. Until its discovery there had been some doubt as to whether Verrazzano had ever made the voyage at all. Background alt=Contemporary map of Verrazzano's 1524 voyage Verrazzano's fellow Italian, Christopher Columbus, in the service of the Catholic Monarchs, had reached the New World in 1492, and over the next thirty years, the three major European powers‚Äîthe British, Portuguese and Spanish‚Äîinvestigated the new continent, claiming land for their respective monarchs when possible. A few years after Columbus, John Cabot had made multiple voyages to Newfoundland in the service of the English King, Henry VII. In September 1522 Sebastiano Elcano made the first circumnavigation of the globe, and in the following year the king of France, Francis I, was persuaded to despatch an expedition. This was under the command of the Florentine explorer and humanist Giovanni da Verrazzano. Verrazzano was tasked with discovering a westward-passage to China, which would enable traders to avoid the treacherous Straits of Magellen. This was the goal Columbus had originally set out to achieve over 30 years earlier. Lyon was the hub of France's silk industry, and a newer, shorter such passage would protect and increase their lucrative trade with Cathay. Francis was a willing backer, although no Royal commission survives for the expedition: he was frustrated that Portugal, Spain, and the Papacy had effectively divided the globe as they knew it between them. France had a particularly bitter commercial rivalry with Portugal, which repeatedly led to armed clashes in the areas where their mutual interests overlapped, such as the Brazilian and West African coasts. On the other hand, Francis wanted Portugal's assistance in the war in Italy. More immediately, his financial situation sufficiently precarious to make an expedition worthwhile‚Äîprovided it discovered a source of new wealth for France. It has been suggested that Verrazzano too was intending to profit personally from his voyage of discovery. The Lyonnais mercantile community was almost exclusively Florentine, like Verrazzano, and effectively formed an expatriate community. Records dating from March the previous year suggest that together Verrazzano and these merchants had formed a syndicate at the expedition's planning stage. This was intended to divide both the investment and the profit from the voyage between them; they are described as tous marchans florentins (French for \\"all Florentine merchants\\"). Verrazzano left France with a ship provided and paid for by the King, a 100-ton caravel called Le Dauphine. He had a crew of 50 men, materiel and provisions sufficient for eight months at sea in December 1523. Verrazzano chose a course across the mid-Atlantic, perhaps aware that by now Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon had mapped the area as far north as 33¬∞ 30' and that Ponce de Lyon had extended Spanish influence from South America up to Florida. This course ensured him the best chance of discovering a western passage while avoiding the Spanish fleet. After forty days sailing they reached and landed just north of Cape Fear, near Myrtle Grove Sound, North Carolina. Verrazzano named this new continent \\"Francesca\\", after his King. He knew he had not reached China, as he described it as \\"a new land which had not been seen before by any man, either ancient or modern\\".  The Codex  Portrait of Verrazzano's patron, Francis I of France (1494‚Äì1547), by Jean Clouet, c.1530 = Discovery = The C√®llere Codex is a manuscript attributed to Verrazzano held in the library of Count Guido Macci of C√®llere in 1908, after which it is named. It was discovered by Italian scholar Alessandro Bacchiani in 1908, who published a critical edition the following year. It was originally written on 8 July 1524 and addressed to a business associate of Gerolamo, Bonacorso Ruscellay. Written in Verrazzano's native Italian, that first draft was transcribed, multiple times, into French for the King. It is unique among the surviving copies in being annotated by Verrazzano himself. These annotations are considerable, and they both expand on the context of the events the Codex describes and provide detailed minutiae about them. It is likely that many other versions of the letter were written for the convenience of the scribe before translating, although they appear not to have survived. The annotated Codex appears to have been given to either Leonardo Tedaldi or Thomaso Sartini, Lyonaisse merchants, and then forwarded to a Roman banker, Bonacorso Ruscellay, who was a relative of Verrazzano's. Within thirty years it was in the possession of noted Italian antiquarian Paolo Giovi, and eventually resurfaced hundreds of years later in the C√®llere library. Bacchiani's version was subsequently translated into French in 1933, and again in 1946. The most recent translation was in 1956. The Director of the Pierpont Library, Frederick B. Adams, Jr., decided to definitively publish the Library's Codex, complete with transcription, translation, appendices and footnotes. Adams appointed the Library's consultant, Lawrence C. Wroth to undertake the work, and it was eventually published in 1970. Wroth's book utilised and printed the 1956 translation of the Codex. The reliance historians of the period have sometimes placed upon it‚ÄîSeymour I. Schwartz, for example, has described it as holding a \\"nuclear position\\" in twentieth- century scholarship‚Äîhas been criticised in some quarters. One modern Italian scholar, Luca Codignola, has blamed this phenomenon on a dearth of contemporary sources other than the Codex, and has condemned what he identifies as a tendency to take the manuscript \\"at face value\\", treating it as \\"a sort of sixteenth-century encyclopaedia\\". Scholars were already aware of two other copies of Verrazzano's letter in existence, although the Codex is generally considered the best quality version; I. N. P. Stokes, as part of his six-volume The Iconography of Manhattan Island, described the Codex as an \\"accurate and full embodiment of Verrazzano's famous lost letter\\" to the King. Further, it was \\"one of the most important documents dealing with the topography of the North-East Coast\\" of the United States, particularly Manhattan island, which had been up until Verrazzano's arrival undiscovered. It has been described as the \\"most significant\\" and the \\"definitive document\\" of Verrazano's voyage on account of its \\"semi-autobiographic\\" nature. The C√®llere Codex was written before Verrazano sent his King, Francis I, an official report, but after he had returned from the New World. Verrazzano devoted about one-third of the Codex to the natives he found on the new continent, especially their appearance, customs and society. Other areas of particular interest were the landscape, including climate and vegetation. In its various forms it is the only primary source historians' possess regarding Verrazzano's 1524 navigation of the north-east, and American historian Lawrence C. Wroth called it \\"the earliest geographical, topological and ethnological survey\\" stretching from Newfoundland to Florida. Indeed, the degree to which historians have relied on the Codex as informing them evidentially on subjects as diverse as flora, fauna, navigation, vegetation patterns, aboriginal relations, native food (\\"very wholesome\\"), and native boats (\\"a single log\\" carrying between 10 and 15 men of around to long). =Description= All three surviving copies of Verrazzano's letter appear to be based upon three separate originals. The Codex was titled A Discourse upon the Indies when it was first transcribed for public consumption by Giovanni Ramusio, the \\"official cosmographer of the Venetian Republic\\". It consists of 12 numbered sheets of Italian paper, with text on both sides, measuring x . It is written in the cursive court hand of the period, probably that of a secretary. It is copiously annotated with marginalia‚Äîat least 26 times‚Äîin a different, more hurried, hand to the prose. This has left ink blots and erasures over the pages. Historian Bernard Hoffman has described what he sees Verrazzano's text as illustrating about him: Verrazzano's writing in the Codex has been interpreted in different ways. Two recent scholars have praised Verrazzano's prose. John Allen has called Verrazzano's landscape descriptions as \\"lyric\\", while Theodore Cachey described him as viewing French territorial expansion \\"through the lens of the Renaissance...it was an eclectic courtly language and literature\\". Margaret Eisendrath, on the other hand, has highlighted the author's \\"detachment\\" from his subject. She particularly notices it in his description of their failed kidnapping of a young woman and the successful kidnap of the boy: \\"what is most striking about this description\\", she suggests, \\"is the way it conveys the natives' terror in the same tone as that in which it praises the material richness of the place\\". A photographic facsimile of the original document was created and published in 1916 by Phelps Stokes, and this was accompanied by a translation of the Codex by Edward Hagaman Hall. The C√®llere Codex is now held by the Morgan Library and Museum, in Manhattan, as MS MA 776. = Voyage description = The Codex states at the very beginning how King Francis' instructions were to \\"discover new lands\\" and especially a new route to Cathay. It begins by describing Verrazzano's departure from France with four ships, of which two were lost almost immediately in a storm. The remaining two, Dauphine and Le Normandie had to turn back to Brittany, where, \\"after a brief period interfering with Spanish shipping\\" off the coast, the Dauphine sailed alone to Madeira. Verrazzano left‚Äî\\"in great secrecy\\"‚Äîfrom Porto Santo, in the far-west of the island, on 17 January 1524. Somewhere in the Atlantic he encountered a violent storm which raged for sixteen hours. Verrazzano attributed the ship's survival to divine intervention‚Äîand its own seaworthiness. He travelled westwards along the 32nd parallel (approximately 150 miles north of Columbus' route) and eventually‚Äîsighting \\"a new land never before seen by anyone\\"‚Äîlanded at Cape Fear. The Codex describes how he sailed south to Florida in search of a harbour. Finding none, he returned to Cape Fear and disembarked, making their first steps upon the new continent. A few days later the Dauphine sailed again, this time north-easterly‚Äîalways within sight of the coastline‚Äîpassing North Carolina and Georgia. This area Verrazzano named Selva di Lauri and Campo di Cedri, or the Forest of Laurels and Field of Cedars. The French next passed Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey‚Äî\\"on a sea characterised by enormous waves\\"‚Äîwhere he recorded seeing Navesink Highlands, which he called \\"little mountain by the sea\\". They next came to New York (which he named Nova Gallia, Latin for New France) and Rhode Island coastlands. Here he \\"temporarily set aside his cautious practice of always dropping anchor off- shore in open waters\\" and sailed straight into what was probably Narragansett Bay. Here he noted its good defensive position and the potential it possessed for coastal fortifications. He described Staten Island and Brooklyn as \\"two small but prominent hills...[either side of] a very wide river\\". The Dauphine then tracked the coast of New England, where in Casco Bay, Maine, they first met natives who were by then experienced in trading with Europeans. the Codex reveals Verrazzano's disapproval of these natives' bad manners, as he saw it, because they were often \\"exhibiting their bare behinds and laughing immoderately\\". left From there they travelled up to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland (which the Codex calls \\"Bacalaia\\"). The Dauphine had returned to Dieppe by early July 1524. However, Codignola notes that although most places can be generally identified, the narrative of the journey \\"is vague at best\\", and there are some areas, such as Chesapeake Bay and the Bay of Fundy, which, it has been asserted, he could not have missed, yet go unmentioned altogether. Chesapeake Bay, it has been noted, is wide but \\"inexplicably (considering his quest for a passageway through the Americas) he did not enter\\". If, however, Verrazzano did indeed miss sighting these places, it may indicate that his attention to the land generally was distracted, possibly by increasingly poor weather conditions; Verrazzano gave \\"the opposing weather\\" as a reason for not landing on an island slightly later in the voyage. Verrazzano navigated the mouth of the Delaware River and named it the \\"Vandoma\\"; he did not, Phelps Stokes noted, name the Hudson River, merely describing it as \\"a very great river\\". Martha's Vineyard he termed \\"Aloysia\\". The Codex is also the only version of Verrazzano's letter to contain a reference to the‚Äî\\"false sea\\" (imaginary)‚ÄîIsthmus of Verrazzano, which is unmentioned on any other contemporary maps of his voyage. This is described in the Codex as \\"an isthmus one mile wide and about two hundred miles long\\" (and which Verrazano annotates as being so long they could \\"see the eastern sea from the ship\\"‚Äîi.e., the Pacific Ocean), and which they thought stretched \\"around the tip of India, China and Cathay\\". American academic Thomas Suarez has discussed Verrazzano's reaction to discovering the supposed-isthmus as \\"bizarre\\": \\"after claiming to have unearthed the 'holy grail' of navigators, Verrazzano apparently made no attempt to cross the 'isthmus', either on land or through any of the inlets he reported, inlets which one of his longboats would have had little difficulty maneuvering. Nor does Verrazzano appear to have made an attempt to return to his promising isthmus\\", particularly as it would have been impossible for him to have not seen the gaps from which fresh water flowed, and which, therefore, could have theoretically provided the passage westwards that he was looking for. Travelling approximately miles northwards, Verrazzano sent a landing party ashore at around what is now Worcester County, Maryland, or Accomac County, Virginia. Due to what he called the \\"beauty of the trees\\"‚Äîdescribing the coast as \\"very green and forested, but without harbours\\"‚Äîhe named the country Arcadia. While ashore, the French kidnapped a native boy. Another miles north brought the Dauphine to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. They soon came to \\"a wide river between two prominent hills and took a small boat up-river to a densely populated land. At that point, the river widened to a lake\\". Verrazzano named one of the peaks \\"Angoleme\\" (King Francis' had been Count of Angouleme before ascending to the throne in 1515) and the other he named \\"Santa Margarita\\", after the king's sister, Margaret of Valois. He named other headlands after members of the French nobility such as the Duc d'Alen√ßon, seigneur de Bonnivet, the Duc de Vend√¥me and the Comte de St-Pol. Verrazzano and his crew had discovered New York Harbour. They dropped anchor at what is now called The Narrows, after which event the Verrazano‚ÄìNarrows Bridge was named. The lake he saw was actually Upper New York Bay, but they did not sail far enough up the river for this to become apparent. He described the many New Yorkers they saw as \\"dressed in birds' feathers of various colours, and they came toward us joyfully uttering loud cries of wonderment\\". It is likely that Verrazzano would have stayed longer, but a storm blew up in the harbour and after only a day the Dauphine was forced to retreat further out to sea, at which point Verrazzano decided to continue his navigation northwards: \\"greatly to our regret\\", wrote Verrazzano, as the region was, he believed \\"not without things of value\\". Verrazzano continued to Rhode Island, where they stopped at Newport, and then sailed another miles, which brought them to Cape Cod. This was a particularly dangerous region for explorers, and Schwartz notes the irony in Verrazzano's naming the area after the \\"intensely disliked papal official\\", Francesco Armellini. The final leg of the journey took them to Newfoundland, or what he termed \\"the land which the Britons once found, which lies in 50 degrees\\" which took him to Cape Breton and Nova Scotia.  Aftermath  The immediate public response to Verrazzano's return to France in 1525 seems to have been that his voyage had been a failure and that the closest he had come to \\"mineral booty were the sweet potatoes whose colour, it was hoped, might be regarded as proof of copper deposits\\". Verrazzano probably intended to return to explore the east coast further, but by the time he returned to France the political situation had changed drastically. French fortunes were falling in the Italian wars, and Francis, already south of Dieppe, in Blois, was personally travelling there to oversee a renewed campaign. Verrazzano despatched a report from Dieppe. Knecht posits that the king may not have found time to read Verrazano's report, or even to meet the navigator in Lyon (where the King had reached by 7 August). Although the King had left Verrazzano a commission to fit out a new expedition (of four ships), no sooner had this been completed then the ships were requisitioned for Francis' war effort. Verrazzano may have attempted to find another patron in either the King of England, or Portugal In the event, he formed a partnership with Admiral Chabot and Jean Ango to travel to the Spice Islands via the Cape of Good Hope, but although his fleet of three ships left France in 1537, the weather was sufficiently poor to force Verrazzano to return to France by that September. He was subsequently instructed by Chabot to seek out \\"a great river on the coast of Brazil\\" in another attempt at seeking a passage to the Pacific. This voyage was to be Verrazzano's last; he was killed and eaten somewhere in the Caribbean, and his ships returned to France without him. Historical significance alt=Diagram showing the relative position of the different manuscript copies of Verrazzano's letter Verrazzano was the first and only European navigator to \\"systematically\\"‚Äîand intentionally‚Äîexplore the east coast of the New World. The most important aspect of the voyage Verrazzano described in the Codex, to contemporaries, was that he had disproved the knowledge handed down by the ancients, who had taught that the Atlantic touched both Europe and Asia with nothing in between. He did not do this deliberately; Wroth points out that Verrazzano's \\"credulity of an open passage to Asia grew out of inherited confidence\\" in early writers, \\"particularly Aristotle\\". Verrazzano himself was persuaded otherwise, and reported that the \\"New World which above I have described is connected together, not adjoining Asia or Africa (which I know to be a certainty)\\". The Codex is, Verrazzano continued, \\"the most accurate and the most valuable of all the early coastal voyages that has come down to us\\". It also led to the creation of what would be the definitive map of the world, Gerolamo's map of 1529 and the Lok Map of 1582. Robertus de Bailly used Gerolamo's map as the basis for his 1530 globe, and all of them included Verrazzano's imaginary isthmus. Verrazzano's voyage, with all its descriptive and cartographical errors, was still important for both explorers and mapmakers, as it effectively filled in a gap between what the Spanish had discovered in the south and what the English had towards Canada. The Codex report, after it was disseminated through the navigational and cartographic communities, \\"bolstered the growing conviction among the best English and French geographers that North America was a separate continent\\", and that a solid land mass connected La Florida of the Spanish to Newfoundland in the north. Verrazzano also provided the provenance and justification for French activities in the Americas: until the end of the century, French diplomacy defended the various actions of French sailors‚Äîwhether corsairs or fishermen‚Äîwith reference to the 1524 voyage. Until the Codex was discovered, nineteenth-century historians had no proof that Verrazzano had ever made his voyage in 1524, as no other record of it was found to exist in either French or Italian archives. Until then, there was some doubt among scholars as to whether his voyage had taken place at all. The nineteenth-century antiquarian Buckingham Smith denounced the entire voyage as \\"a fabrication\\", and H. C. Murphy \\"plausibly argued\\" that not only had Verrazzano never reached America but that the letter of 8 July 1524 was not even his. They believed, instead, that Verrazzano was instead a corsair named Jean Florin (\\"the Florentine\\"). This historiographical dispute was known as the \\"Verrazzano controversy\\". It was considered at least possible that Verrazzano's letter was a fraud and one which had had the active participation of King Francis. Francis' intention, it was suggested, was to allow him to lay claim to the country without the need to fund an expensive exploration. The American Antiquarian Society, for example, stated at their 1876 AGM that \\"the time seems not yet to have arrived when this society should attempt a judicial decision upon the claims made in behalf of John Verrazzano to the distinction of being the discoverer of a large portion of the North American coast\\". In response, The Nation wrote the same year that the controversy could not be over, because there were still \\"archives to search, documents to compare, statements to verify or impugn\\", and that suggestions that Verrazzano had not made the voyages as claimed were based solely on assumptions by his critics. The French cartographic scholar Marcel Destombes noted that in the light of modern scholarship, the criticisms of Smith and Murphy‚Äî\\"whose books nobody now reads\\"‚Äîhave been discounted and the Codex is seen as just latest and best piece of evidence for Verrazzano's 1524 navigation, for which the evidence was already firm.

In: Encyclopedia of North Carolina, edited by William S. Powell, 2006. Retrieved on 21 July 2018. On the same day, 119 years later, a trespassing pedestrian was hit and killed by a train on the bridge.  Accident  Steam Locomotive No. 166 of train No. 9 of the Richmond & Danville Railroad (R & D) left Statesville on August 27, 1891, at around 2:30 a.m. with a five-car train: a baggage car, a first- and second- class car, a Pullman sleeper, and the railroad superintendent's private car [Bridger's] from the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The train was 34 minutes late and travelled at probably 35 to 40 miles per hour (55‚Äì65 km/h) to catch up on the delay. Less than five minutes after the train had left Statesville, it derailed and crashed from the Bostian Bridge, a 60- foot (18-meter), five- bay natural stone and brick bridge that spans Third Creek. The sleeping car hit the ground 153 feet (47 m) from where it had left the bridge. Several of the less heavily injured survivors ran back to Statesville to report the disaster. Rescue workers made their way to the train, and took the injured to Statesville, which did not have a hospital, so they needed to be accommodated and cared for in private homes. The dead were taken to a tobacco warehouse for identification. Drawings after photos by JH Van Ness After the rescue, thousands of onlookers came. The photographers William Stimson from Statesville and JH Van Ness from Charlotte took pictures and sold hundreds of them in the following weeks. An illustration of the accident illustrated with a Van Ness photo appeared in Frank Leslie's Weekly, an illustrated newspaper.  Investigation  Four days after the accident, a judicial inquiry concluded that the accident had been caused by unknown persons removing nails from the rails, which were probably in neglected condition. As R & D was experiencing financial difficulties, those who feared large claims for compensation worked feverishly to find the alleged saboteurs. For months railroad detectives swarmed through the area. Several people were detained and interrogated, but eventually released. In 1897, two men who were already in the state penitentiary were convicted of alleged confessions to other inmates causing the accident.  Subsequent events  According to legend, on the anniversary of the accident, the screeching of the wheels and screams of the passengers can still be heard, and the ghost of a uniformed railway employee can be seen with a gold watch. According to slightly varying accounts, the ghost of the man with the golden clock was first seen on the first anniversary of the accident. It is said to have been the spirit of Baggage Master Hugh K. Linster, whose body was found with a broken neck in the wreckage.Phil Gast: 'Ghost train' hunter killed by train in North Carolina.

On the 119th anniversary of the accident, on August 27, 2010, just before 3:00 am, 10 to 12 amateur ghost observers, so-called ghost hunters, were illegally on the bridge, hoping to hear the sounds of the accident and perhaps see something. Instead, a real Norfolk Southern train came with three locomotives and one carriage. The terrified ghost observers ran about 150 foot (50 m) back towards Statesville, to get to safety. All but two made it. The 29-year-old Christopher Kaiser from Charlotte was hit by the train and killed. A woman, whom Kaiser wanted to bring to safety, fell about 10 to 12 feet from the bridge and was so badly injured that she had to be treated at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte.Family: Man killed by train saved girlfriend.

Headquartered in Tiptur, Karnataka, the company manufactures, markets, and sells Organic Milk and Milk products. The organization was founded in 2010 with a vision to transform livelihood based agricultural operations into wealth creation opportunities.  History  Akshayakalpa was registered on October 2, 2010. However, the Genesis of Akshayakalpa dates to the years 2001 to 2009, where the Youva Chethna program led by Dr. G.N.S. Reddy from Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BAIF) encouraged like-minded people from urban areas to contribute in cash and kind to train young people and women in need in rural regions to take up agriculture/farming as a vocation of choice. Nine Techies, including Akshayakalpa co-founder Shashi Kumar and his friends Venkatesh Seshasayee, Ranjith Mukundan, Ravishankar Shiroor, Ramakrishna Adukuri, Praveen Nale, Giridhar Bhat, Ramkumar Iyer and Mohammed Ashraf, then working with Wipro Technologies, were some of the earliest contributors to the Youva Chethana Program. The idea of young people being trained to take up agriculture/farming as a vocation of choice was transformed into idea of rural entrepreneurship model under Akshayakalpa in the year 2010, when the above- mentioned techies seed funded Akshayakalpa in November the same year. The initiative was also crowdfunded by several other employees of Wipro Technologies. The founding team was known to defy corruption, which is rampant in Indian bureaucracy and refused to pay bribes at various levels while seeking clearances and licenses to begin operations.  Philosophy  Akshayakalpa was born as a farmer entrepreneurship initiative. The organization aims to address the bilateral problem of economic non viability in agriculture which entails farmers to either move away from farming or resort to means like chemical fertilizers and pesticides and poor-quality food for the consumer. The team identifies young farmers who have discontinued farming operations due to economic non viability and grooms them to relocate back to farming by providing bank linkages, farmers outreach and technical services and access to markets. Akshayakalpa handholds the farmer on a continuous basis and ensures economic viability of the farming operations. Today, the company is working with farmers in and around Tiptur, Karnataka and Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, and grooming them to be entrepreneurs by transforming their farming operations from livelihood focused to wealth creation opportunity.  Farms  Akshayakalpa works with farmers to set up small organic dairy farms that are owned and looked after by farmer families. The farms are optimally automated and self-sustaining. Each farm invests Rs. 25 lakhs, financed by Akshayakalpa partner banks, which is utilized to build the farms. The farms are made up of twenty-five cows, automatic milking systems, a biogas plant, a bio-digester, fodder choppers and a chilling unit among other facilities that enhance productivity. After a research of over a year, Akshayakalpa came up with the ideal size for a dairy farm ‚Äì twenty-five cows. ‚ÄúLess than 25 cows won‚Äôt give the required output to gain profit after investing, and it is not possible to give personal attention to each cow if there are more than twenty-five cows,‚Äù says the CEO and co-founder Shashi Kumar. Inducting farmers to the Akshayakalpa model is a rigorous process and takes anywhere between 18 to 24 months. The farmers are groomed on various aspects like maintaining soil without chemicals, closed loop soil management, raising cows without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones. The company has stringent guidelines regarding the maintenance of the farms and the cattle. The cows are mainly fed on green fodder grown without chemical inputs. No hormones are injected, or oil cakes fed to boost milk production. The animals receive a regular check-up from doctors trained in ethnoveterinary practices to ensure that they are healthy and produce milk free from antibiotics and growth hormones. All the farms associated with Akshayakalpa have the same design. The company ensures clean and stress-free housing for the animals. They are airy, steel-roofed sheds, with rubber mats on cemented floor for animal comfort. The cows and calves are stall-fed but not tethered. They are free to graze on a dedicated paddock area. The emphasis is on cleanliness. The dung has to be promptly cleared. The farmers are taught closed loop soil health management. The dung and urine are flushed into a biogas plant. The gas (methane) is used to operate a generator that produces power for eight hours in a day. This electricity is used to power the day-to- day activity on farms. Further, the slurry from the bio-gas plant is led to a bio-digester. The filtrate is pumped out through a sprinkler system to the farm. The cultivation is entirely organic, avoiding chemical fertilizers. The milking is done with machines that imitate the sucking of a calf. The milk is chilled immediately on site. Chilling the milk is mandatory at the farm level. The milk is chilled to 4 degree Celsius to ensure high quality. The system sends the data to the central server where it is analysed. The automation has significantly reduced manual labour and has made farm operations drudgery free. This is important for women who have to do household chores as well. It is also meant to persuade youth to stay in villages and take up agriculture as a vocation of choice. The company works with the goal of enabling rural entrepreneurship and wealth creation among farmers in and around Tiptur, Arsikere, Channarayapatna, Chikkanayakana Halli, Kadur and Holenarasipura.  Products  = Akshayakalpa Organic Milk = The company sells milk from indigenous crossbreeds as well as native breeds Amruth Mahal and Hallikar. They have three variants of milk ‚Äì Whole Cream, Skimmed Milk, and Lactose-free Milk. The Whole Cream milk is pasteurized, they do not homogenize or standardize the milk; it has 3.4% - 4.5% fat. The term whole cream comes from the fact that nature of the milk has not been altered, it is delivered the way it comes from cows. The other available variant is Skimmed Milk. It has a maximum of 0.5% fat; it is meant for people who are either calorie conscious or simply do not like the layer of cream in their milk. It is not advisable for children. Akshayakalpa also caters to individuals who are sensitive to lactose. Their lactose-free is pure Organic Cow Milk with special enzymes that break lactose into lactase. = Akshayakalpa Organic Curd = Akshayakalpa Organic Curd is known for its homely taste and texture. It is made from Organic Cow milk and special cultures that don‚Äôt get activated at room temperature. Curd often becomes sour when left out of cold chain due to bacterial activity. Because Akshayakalpa uses cultures that don‚Äôt get activated at room temperature, they are able to naturally maintain the quality of the curd for a longer time. The curd has no added preservatives or stabilizers. = Akshayakalpa Organic Spiced Buttermilk = The company also manufactures and sells Organic Spiced Buttermilk. The butter milk is made from Organic Desi Cow Curd, Organic Spices, and active probiotic cultures. = Akshayakalpa Organic Handcrafted Malai Paneer = Akshayakalpa Organic Handcrafted Malai Paneer is made from fresh, wholesome Organic Cow Milk and Organic Curd. To make 1 kg of Paneer, approximately 8 litres of milk is used. Akshayakalpa Organic Paneer has 50% moisture and 50% milk solids. It is also high in protein content; 100 grams of the Paneer has 20 grams of protein. = Akshayakalpa Organic Artisanal Cheese = Akshayakalpa Organic Artisan cheese is made from wholesome organic cow milk using traditional methods. Akshayakalpa is one of the few players in the country that produced non- processed Artisanal Cheese. No artificial emulsifiers or preservatives are added to the cheeses; the only preservative it contains is Organic Himalayan Pink Salt. It takes around 3 months to make Akshayakalpa Cheeses. The cheese is first made using microbial rennet under certain conditions, no animal rennet is used. Then the freshly made cheese is pressed into blocks using weights. These blocks are then aged in ripening rooms with a temperature of 15 degree C and 80% humidity. The blocks are turned and checked every day to ensure there are no molds growing on the cheeses.

New Buda is located along 270th Avenue, south of Davis City. History New Buda was founded as a Hungarian settlement in the summer of 1850 by L√°szl√≥ √öjh√°zi. √öjh√°zi hoped to colonize the area with German- speaking Hungarians fleeing the revolution in Hungary. The New Buda post office opened that fall, with √öjh√°zi listed as postmaster. The townsite was platted in 1851. According to Vassady (1991), Hungarian settlers \\"came to the incipient colony during its first two years, but few remained permanently.\\" Although more than 100 emigres planned to settle the New Buda area, the community remained small. Hungarian residents included Count Ott√≥ Zichy, Baron J√≥zsef Mayth√©ny, L√°szl√≥ Madar√°sz, Gy√∂rgy Pomutz, and Frigyes Ker√©nyi. The hardships of pioneer life proved too much for the settlers. The Hungarians' \\"experience managing developed estates in Hungary was of little help in breaking prairie soil or in the use of survival techniques until the first crops came in.\\" The Hungarian settlers gradually left New Buda, some moving to Davenport, where Hungarians had already settled. Between 1853 and 1858, New Buda had around 70-80 residents, with eight houses along the Grand River. But by the 1870s, the community was in decline. The Ausgleich of 1867 had granted amnesty to the Hungarians, and many of them returned to Austria-Hungary, while others fought in the American Civil War. By 1875, the New Buda schoolhouse was abandoned; Ign√°c Hainer, the last postmaster, recommended the closure of the post office in 1880.

It was founded by Jon McCurley and Daniel Vila in 2009, and was known as an eclectic underground artist-driven venue which created a space in the Toronto art scene for less conventional and less profitable projects. It closed in June 2018\\\\. History Double Double Land was opened in 2009 by Jon McCurley and Daniel Vila. Initially located in a second floor flat at 209 Augusta Avenue, it expanded into a community-focused space with the assistance of roommates Steve Thomas and Rob Gordon. The house required extensive clean up and renovations to address what Vila recalled in a 2014 interview as the \\"garbage, cockroaches, graffiti, and smashed walls\\" left behind by former tenants. The idea for Double Double Land was prompted by events previously held by Vila and Bonny Poon at Jamie's Area, which operated out of a basement at 193 Augusta Avenue. The first official event at Double Double Land was a reading by American poet Eileen Myles. Over the course of Double Double Land's operation, events were organized, overseen and subsidized by a rotating number of tenants whose opened their home to local and touring artists. A multi-faceted community-focused venue, Double Double Land served a variety of roles including music venue, gallery space and comedy bar. Vila explained that the purpose of the space as \\"provid[ing] performance experiences that don't make sense in other places.\\" In addition to hosting the monthly performance show Doored (2012‚Äì2015), the venue featured events and installations by artists including Petra Glynt, Le1f, New Fries, Grimes and Ian Svenonius. In addition to being a home for off-the-beaten-path performers and artists, Double Double Land had a progressive approach to how it served the community. In 2016, it was one of Toronto's first venues to stock overdose kits in response to the growing number of fentanyl related overdoses. Double Double Land organizers also committed themselves to introducing safety measures to address the issue of sexual violence in music and arts communities following an assault at the venue in 2015. In consultation with the Toronto- based Noise Against Sexual Assault initiative, the venue added panic buttons to washrooms and changed the design of doorways in order to improve sight lines. =Closure= Double Double Land's closure was announced by Vila as part of a Facebook event announcement in late June 2018, which indicated that performances by Mary Ocher, Lief Hall, Bile Sister and Canadian Romantic would be the last at the venue. Though a reason for the closure was not disclosed, Vila indicated that the venue was being shut down by the landlord. Despite a lack of details, media coverage regarding the announcement linked the development to the pressures of Toronto's real estate market on the city's arts scene. In writing about the impact of Double Double Land's closure on the Toronto art scene, Mark Streeter pointed to the tension between fostering unconventional art projects and profitability: \\"There's a reason why any city needs venues like this: they offer programming and events that are simply too risky and unprofitable for any business-minded venue to take on.\\" References Category:Music venues in Toronto Category:Performance art venues Category:2009 establishments in Ontario Category:2018 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"Double Double Land"},{"id":"57960416","text":"Earl Avery Thompson in his youth (unknown year) Earl Avery Thompson (July 1, 1891 - April 20, 1967) was an American engineer and inventor who had a goal to make driving the automobile safer by reducing the effort required to shift the manual transmission of the day. Thompson even wanted to automate the process of shifting the transmission. Two of his most notable achievements towards that goal are listed on this page: Early Life and Career Thompson was born in Elgin, Oregon, on July 1, 1891. He was educated at Oregon State College where he majored in mechanical and electrical engineering. Thompson worked for General Motors Corporation (GM) from 1929-1940. Thompson left GM May 1, 1940, to begin his own business, the E.A. Thompson Manufacturing Co. In Ferndale, Michigan. Thompson manufactured the Thompson Automatic Profiling Milling machine which is used by manufacturers in the production of arms, plane, tank, and gun parts.https://www.scribd.com/document/281019992/Ferndale-1918-1943-25-Years- of-Progress Thompson died April 20, 1967, at the age of 85 in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Notable Achievements =The Synchro-Mesh Transmission= Thompson's 1918 invention of a synchromesh manual transmission using a tapered cone synchronizer to prevent gear clash (US Patent US1435430 in March 1922https://patents.google.com/patent/US1435430) would make shifting a manual transmission faster, easier and safer. In April of 1922 Thompson, armed with drawings and data for a prototype synchromesh transmission, set out for Detroit to sell it to the automobile industry. But the automobile manufacturers were not impressed; their customers, he was told, were satisfied with transmissions just as they were. Thompson persisted. After several trips between Oregon and Detroit, and months spent improving the design, and two more patent applications,https://patents.google.com/patent/US2101825https://patents.google.com/patent/US1888640 he was finally able to arrange a meeting with Lawrence Fisher, managing director of Cadillac Motor Car Division and Ernest Seaholm, Cadillac's chief engineer. They were interested in the idea, and (in 1924) Thompson was retained as a consultant while the transmission was perfectedhttps://archive.org/details/ECL-147 (10 models in all). The first cars to use Thompson's synchromesh transmission design were Cadillac and LaSalle cars in 1928, then Buick 8's in 1931.https://www.newspapers.com/image/275036482/?terms=Earl%2BA.%2BThompson Thompson sold his synchromesh transmission patents to GM in 1924 and 1930 for a reported $1 Million. Thompson became an employee of Cadillac Motor Car Division on September 1, 1929, and was appointed to be assistant chief engineer. Thompson continued improving the design of the synchronizer. In 1933. Thompson began working on the development of an automatically shifting transmission. Thompson left Cadillac in 1934 and joined the General Motors Corporation (GM) Engineering Department.http://www.dvwd.org/earlthompson.html =GM Automatic Safety Transmission Development= In 1934 at the GM Engineering Department, Thompson became the project leader of a group of 4 engineers including Ralph F.

Truck and Coach Division where the development of a hydraulic torque converter drive for a transit bus was proceeding.http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/y/yellow_coach/yellow_coach2.htm Thompson's group combined a fluid coupling with a unique hydraulically controlled, automatically shifting 4-speed planetary transmission, introduced as an option on 1940 Oldsmobiles as Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass- produced fully automatic transmission. The 1940 Hydra-Matic transmission would continue to be refined and produced for another 16 years, including wartime use in some military vehicles. Awards *Recipient of the Elmer A.

It was titled \\"An Act for Amending the Laws relating to the Settlement, Employment, and Relief of the Poor\\".George Nicholls, A History of the English Poor Law in Connection with the State of the Country and the Condition of the People, Volume II: A.D. 1714 to 1853 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1898), pp. 12-13. The Act repeated the clause of the Poor Relief Act 1691 that ordered that in every parish a book should be kept, registering the names of everyone receiving relief and the reasons why.Nicholls, p. 13. No one else was permitted to receive relief (except in cases of disease, plague or smallpox) except by authority of a Justice of the Peace who lived in or near the parish or who was visiting during quarter sessions. The Act claimed that \\"many persons have applied to some justices of peace without the knowledge of any officers of the parish, and thereby, upon untrue suggestions, and sometimes upon false and frivolous pretences, have obtained relief, which hath greatly contributed to the increase of the parish rates\\". To rectify this, the Act ordered that no Justice of the Peace could award poor relief until the recipient had taken an oath on the reason why they needed to claim relief. This was applicable in cases where the overseers or the vestry had refused someone relief and the Act ordered that the Justice of the Peace was first required to summon the overseer to discover why that relief had been refused. The Act reiterated the need for the Justice of the Peace to register this relief and stipulated that such relief should continue only so long as the causes for it continued. Any overseer or parish officer who awarded relief without first registering it \\"except upon sudden and emergent occasions\\" was to be punished by forfeiting and paying ¬£5 to be used for the poor of the parish. The Act also empowered churchwardens and overseers (with the consent of the vestry) \\"to purchase or hire any house or houses, and to contract with any persons for the lodging, keeping, maintaining and employing any or all such poor persons in their respective parishes, etc., as shall desire to receive relief, and there to keep, maintain, and employ all such poor persons, and take the benefit of Parishes their work, labour, and service\\".Nicholls, p. 14. Where a parish could not afford to maintain a workhouse on their own, the Act permitted the parish to join other parishes in purchasing a building for this purpose, so long as it had the permission of the vestry and a local Justice of the Peace. If a poor person refused to be lodged in a workhouse, the Act ordered them to be \\"put out of the book in which the names of persons who ought to receive relief are registered, and [they] shall not be entitled to ask or receive relief from the churchwardens and overseers\\".

This breccia triple pinnacle is part of the North Cascades Range. The Triplets is situated above Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest higher peak is Cascade Peak, to the west-northwest. Surface runoff from the mountain drains into the Cascade River. Climate The Triplets in winter The Triplets is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was built from 1859 to 1864. It is also known as St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church (former) and St Anne's Catholic Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The church is significant primarily because of its strong associations with the important figure archpriest John Joseph Therry (1790-1864), co-founder of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia; champion of the rights of Irish immigrants and convicts; and patron of several church building projects in New South Wales and Tasmania. The building derives considerable significance from its location in a village square conceived by Therry in 1837, which, although never fully realised, retains a townscape significance value not found elsewhere in New South Wales. The modest character of the building reflects the needs and requirements of the time and the restrictions imposed by finances and the use of local building materials and techniques. The church stands in the village square, conceived by Archpriest John Joseph Therry in 1837, the original foundation stone laid on 2 July 1841. The church was built between 1859‚Äì64 and the subdivision streets were named for prominent ecclesiastics of the time.  Description  Located in the north east corner of the square (the centre being subject to clay deposits) it is typical of an Irish village church with additions, such as the vestry with fireplace. Built of solid brick (cement rendered in 1952) with sandstone footing course. Dressed sills and cappings to the buttresses. The brick interior is painted to the dado level. The sanctuary is plastered with interesting stencil work. The rest of the square is now occupied by the new church, primary school and car park.RNE, 1987 The Church was cement rendered in 1952.

She is married to Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (\\"El Mencho\\"), Mexico's most-wanted man and the CJNG leader. Born in rural Michoac√°n, Rosalinda grew up in a family of 18 siblings and was the eldest of her sisters. Her family originally grew avocados, but eventually turned to cultivating marijuana and opium poppy. In the 1970s, her family formed the Milenio Cartel, the predecessor group of the CJNG, and began trafficking narcotics from Mexico to the United States. According to Mexico's Secretariat of the Interior, Rosalinda oversaw the CJNG's financial and legal resources, including over 70 businesses affiliated with the criminal group. Some of them were sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Rosalinda's defense claims she is not guilty and was a victim of defamation due to her relationship with El Mencho. On 26 May 2018, Rosalinda was arrested by the Mexican Navy in Zapopan, Jalisco, for her alleged involvement in money laundering. After three months of hearings and legal battles, a judge granted her release from prison after she paid a MXN$1.5 million bail. Rosalinda's trial is ongoing and held behind closed doors. Early life Rosalinda Gonz√°lez Valencia was born in El Naranjo, a rural community in Aguililla, Michoac√°n, Mexico, on . Her father was J. Abigael Gonz√°lez Mendoza and her mother was Estela Valencia Far√≠as. According to the Mexican government, Rosalinda's family includes at least 18 siblings. The males were Abigael, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, √âdgar Ed√©n, Mauricio, Gerardo, Jos√© and Luis √Ångel. The females were Rosalinda (also known as Rosal√≠a), Noem√≠, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, Mar√≠a Elena, √ârika and Abiga√≠l. Rosalinda was the eldest of the sisters. People in their hometown nicknamed the clan \\"Cuinis\\" in reference to a squirrel (spermophilus adocetus) from the area that is known as \\"Cuinique\\". It is common for this squirrel to have over a dozen babies each time the mother gives birth. When Rosalinda was young, her family was poor and grew avocados for a living in a plantation field they owned in Michoac√°n. By the 1970s, however, the family began cultivating and trafficking marijuana and opium poppy from Mexico to the United States. Rosalinda's economic status improved when her siblings emigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s and got involved in the drug trade in California. Her siblings worked for the Milenio Cartel, a criminal group from Michoac√°n that was formed several members of Rosalinda's family; their main leader was Armando Valencia Cornelio (\\"El Maradona\\" and/or \\"El Juanito\\"), who was responsible for shipping large sums of narcotics to the U.S. from the Mexican states of Michoac√°n and Jalisco. Though few details are known of her personal life, security forces believe that Rosalinda was married to Armando. Armando and Rosalinda eventually separated in the 1990s, and she began dating Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (\\"El Mencho\\"). El Mencho was a close associate of his siblings and grew up in the same rural community as Rosalinda's. He worked as a guard for the clan's marijuana plantations and eventually joined Rosalinda's siblings in the drug trade in the U.S. After El Mencho was deported to Mexico, he joined a local police force and married Rosalinda in 1996. Their matrimony helped strengthen El Mencho's relationship with Rosalinda's clan. They had three children: Laisha, Jessica Johana, and Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez (\\"El Menchito\\"). El Mencho was one of the founders of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a criminal group that sprung in the 2010s after the Milenio Cartel splintered. In the 2000s, several of Rosalinda's family members were arrested by security forces, which splintered the Milenio Cartel into two factions, Los Torcidos and La Resistencia. Los Torcidos was headed by El Mencho and several of Rosalinda's family members, and they eventually consolidated their influence after defeating La Resistencia. After Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n was extradited to the U.S. in 2017, El Mencho became Mexico's most-wanted man. Career According to Mexico's Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB), a branch of the federal government, Rosalinda was responsible for overseeing the CJNG's financial and legal resources. Her role was to reportedly manage multiple CJNG-affiliated business and oversee fines and taxes owed by these firms. Within the CJNG, Rosalinda was reportedly referred to by her alias La Jefa (English: The Boss). Authorities suspect she took over these activities after the arrest of her brother Abigael on 28 February 2015. With Abigael behind bars, the government began a crackdown on Los Cuinis, the name of the clan's group, and was successful at arresting or charging several of Rosalinda's siblings. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Justice, and State, Los Cuinis is the financial bloc of the CJNG and is made up of members of Rosalinda's clan, with Abigael as its main figurehead. Both the CJNG and Los Cuinis are intertwined through drug trafficking activities, money laundering networks, and familial ties. They have dealings in multiple parts of the world, including the United States, Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Since 2015, authorities suspect that Rosalinda headed a network of over 70 businesses affiliated with the CJNG. They stated that Rosalinda was responsible for laundering over MXN$1 billion (over US$50 million) between 2015 and 2016. Her suspected role within the CJNG was similar to those of the other women within her immediate and extended family. Her sisters Mar√≠a Ivette and Noem√≠, in addition to Jennifer Beaney Camacho C√°zares, the wife of her brother Abigael, and Wendy Delaithy Amaral Ar√©valo, wife of her brother Gerardo, were also suspected of money laundering for their alleged role in heading multiple businesses owned by the CJNG. Among the businesses they owned included companies in the following industries: healthcare, tourism, hospitality, retail, consulting, agriculture, advertising, real estate, and international trade. From 8 April 2015 to 12 February 2018, Rosalinda and her daughter Jessica Johana issued six writs of amparo in courts based in Jalisco and Mexico City to prevent law enforcement from arresting them. Rosalinda began this legal procedure because she feared for their arrest and suspected authorities were looking to apprehend them. This suspicion began on 8 April 2015, when El Mencho and Abigael were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (\\"Kingpin Act\\"). Over the years leading to 2018, Rosalinda's siblings and in-laws were also sanctioned under the Kingpin Act for their alleged involvement in the CJNG. However, her writs of amparos were denied by the courts, which cited that there were no active arrests warrants against her in Mexico.  Arrest and imprisonment  On the evening of 26 May 2018, Rosalinda was arrested by the Mexican Navy outside a 7-Eleven convenience store in Puerta de Hierro, an upscale neighborhood in Zapopan, Jalisco. She was living in Torre Aura Altitude (es), a luxurious tall residential building, close to where she was arrested. Authorities filmed a video showing the moment when Rosalinda was apprehended; when authorities approached her, they asked for her name, to which she responded positively. They then asked for her daughter Jessica, and Rosalinda confirmed she was not with her. Authorities then proceeded to apprehend her, and told her about the arrest warrant and the money laundering and organized crime charges against her. Rosalinda was told to give her car keys to the friend that was with her, and was told by her detainers that she would be taken to Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). Rosalinda's companion said she would go with them, and Rosalinda asked her to call her lawyer. Upon her arrest, she was transported to the Estadio Akron, a multipurpose stadium in Zapopan, and taken via helicopter to Mexico City. Once in Mexico City, she was taken to the offices of the Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special Investigations on Organized Crime (SEIDO), Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency, for her legal declaration. On 28 May, Rosalinda was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation No. 16, a female maximum-security prison in Coatl√°n del R√≠o, Morelos. A large security surveillance measure was erected at the prison when Rosalinda was taken there. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) stated that the prison had multiple deficiencies, including insufficient number of personnel, lack of adequate healthcare, personnel oversight, prisoner activities and rehabilitation, and inmate categorization. On 29 May, a court granted Rosalinda a writ of amparo and allowed her to communicate with her defense. Rosalinda issued this because she claimed that the PGR was not allowing her to speak with her defense and was violating Article 14, Article 16, and Article 22 of the Constitution of Mexico, which cites violations of due process, law arrest, and cruel and unusual punishment as unconstitutional. On 31 May, a court from the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in the Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico, confirmed that Rosalinda's first case hearing would be held there the next day, and that she would be transferred from Morelos to attend it. = Background and reactions = On 27 May 2018, SEGOB's head Alfonso Navarrete Prida confirmed Rosalinda's arrest in a press conference. He stated that the operation that led to her arrest was part of a law enforcement-led campaign known as Operation Escudo Tit√°n, which was launched on 28 January 2018 to combat organized crime. The operation that led to Rosalinda's arrest was specifically led by Mexico's National Security Commission (CNS) (es), the Mexican Federal Police, and other law enforcement institutions. During the press conference, Navarrete Prida highlighted the fact that the arrest was not conducted in flagrante delicto, but rather was part of an in-depth investigation and had the support of the court. Authorities confirmed that they had increase the presence of security forces in Jalisco on 21 May, when affiliates of the CJNG attempted to murder Luis Carlos N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco, Jalisco's Secretary of Labor and former State Attorney General. He survived with non-threatening injuries, but multiple civilians were wounded and one eight-month-old baby was killed. Shootouts and roadblocks broke out in Guadalajara that day. Authorities also confirmed that the arrest occurred without a single shot fired, and that she was suspected of heading the CJNG's financials. Navarrete Prida stated that Rosalinda had an arrest warrant for money laundering and organized crime involvement charges, but that she was not part of Mexico's 122 most-wanted people, a list that was created in the administration of President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (2012‚Äì2018). Along with Rosalinda, authorities also confirmed the arrest of Gerardo Botello Rosales (\\"El Cachas\\"), a suspected high-ranking member of the CJNG. Navarrete Prida did not confirm if security forces were close to arresting El Mencho when Rosalinda was apprehended. The Government of Jalisco raised their security measures across Jalisco the following morning as a preventative measure for Rosalinda's arrest. They worked together with municipal and federal forces to prevent a response from the CJNG. However, Governor Arist√≥teles Sandoval discarded that the measures were part of the state's \\"red code\\" alert, a designation used to warn citizens of risk situations across the state. This is the highest level in the alert system and is used when the state is considered to be under great danger. Rumors had surfaced earlier that day among the local press that the governor had ordered the activation of the red code alert. However, as precaution updates and rumors spread on social media among the citizens of Jalisco, the governor stepped in to clarify no alert had been issued, and asked citizens to not spread rumors on social media.  Trial  On 1 June 2018, her hearing was held in private after Rosalinda's lawyers and the government mutually agreed to it. The plaintiff asked the judge to hold the hearing behind closed doors because much of the evidence they were presenting that day against Rosalinda was also being used against the CJNG in other investigations, and they said they did not want for it to be released to the public. Rosalinda as stated she feared for her physical integrity and did not want the press during the hearing. When asked why she feared for her life, Rosalinda explained that the media was negatively portraying her and claiming she was a criminal. \\"Yes, your honor ... I am not a criminal, I've been defamed\\", she told the judge in her defense. The judge granted this decision and ordered journalists and her family out of the court. The hearing began at 1 p.m. and lasted for approximately twelve hours. During the hearing, the judge considered that the evidences provided by the plaintiff accusing Rosalinda of money laundering were sufficient. Her organized crime involvement charge was dropped after the judge did not consider that the evidences presented were strong enough to link her directly with the CJNG. Specifically, the plaintiff cited a company that Rosalinda reportedly managed on the CJNG's behalf, JJGON, S.P.R. DE R.L. DE C.V., as evidence of her link to the criminal group. They also cited over 70 firms reportedly owned by the CJNG that Rosalinda was accused of managing. Some of these businesses were sanctioned under the Kingpin Act. The plaintiff stated she made over MXN$1 billion (over US$50 million) from these firms between 2015 and 2016. Her defense tried to discredit this claim, but the judge stated that he was convinced Rosalinda received illegal funds from the CJNG to purchase and liquidate assets on their behalf. The money made from these investments was then believed to be transferred by Rosalinda to private bank accounts owned by the CJNG. As this decision was finalized, the judge ordered Rosalinda back to Morelos' prison under pre-trial detention status. He stated that Rosalinda was considered a flight risk if granted bail. Rosalinda's defense issued two writs of amparos after her first hearing to request her release from prison. On 6 June 2018, a federal judge in Mexico City rejected one of them that attempted to revert her detention status. The second request was issued to ask for her release from prison on bail; the defense cited that money laundering was not a \\"serious crime\\" under Mexican federal law, and that she should be allowed to be released while the trial continues. On 6 September 2018, this request was granted by a federal judge. Rosalinda was released from prison after paying around MXN$1.5 million in bail (approximately US$78,000). The case tilted in her favor because a judge considered that Rosalinda's sentimental ties with El Mencho were not evidence of wrongdoing, and because she was not legally obligated to know the origins of her husband's funds. On 27 October 2018, her defense issued a writ of amparo asking an appeals court to notify them if the PGR had opened new investigations against her since she was released from prison on bail. This request was previously issued by her defense on 26 July, and admitted into court on 5 November. An appeals court initially rejected Rosalinda's motion, but a tribunal ordered the judge to reconsider the request.

Status dog is a term used in the United Kingdom to describe a potentially dangerous or aggressive dog that is kept as a symbol of the owner's hard or tough image, to intimidate others, and possibly as a weapon. This idea has persisted through centuries, tracing back to Roman times. More recently, after news of vicious dogs mauling young victims, the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 placed restrictions on the ownership and care of four types of dog (the Pit Bull Terrier, the Japanese Tosa, the Dogo Argentino, and the Fila Brasileiro); while two further breeds, the Rottweiler and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, are also widely perceived as status dogs. The UK has been taking steps to address the problem, starting with the Metropolitan Police establishing a dedicated Status Dog Unit in 2009.  History  Throughout the ages, dogs have been used as tools for violence. As early as 7th century BC, there is historical evidence of weapon dogs being utilized by the Roman army. Varying historical circumstances began to build negative connotation with specific breeds, starting with bloodhounds in the 19th century. Bloodhounds received heavy criticism in America due to their involvement with tracking down runaways during the slavery era. The same fate awaited the Doberman breed, which initially were in high regard during the 1900s as symbols of nobility and trust. Their reputation plummeted once photographs emerged of German concentration camps during World War II, featuring Nazi officers and their Doberman pets. Government propaganda and popular media started portraying this breed, along with Rottweilers and German Shepherds, as 'demon dogs'. Arguably the most notorious of status dogs, the pit bull, can be traced back to the Middle Ages. This species was achieved through centuries of selective breeding, a method by which humans intentionally select animals with desirable physical traits to reproduce. The pit bull was made to be vicious, in order to be used for bull-baiting during the 1800s. The sport was eventually banned, which in turn resulted in a new blood sport, dog fighting. This trend ultimately created the infamous public image of the pit bull, thus making way for street gangs to take advantage of it by adopting the use of pit bulls as symbols of strength and ferocity during the 1960s. Their image took an even stronger turn for the worse in 1987, when a young boy was attacked and killed by a pit bull in California. Major magazine publications, like Sports Illustrated and Time, initiated the introduction of laws across the US banning specific dog breeds after running issues with pit bulls on the front cover, with titles such as \\"Beware of this dog\\" and \\"Time Bomb On Legs\\". In 1991, an incident similar to the pit bull mauling in California 1987 occurred in the UK, where a girl of six years was hospitalized after being mauled by a pit bull while playing outside in a park, which ultimately led to the Dangerous Dogs Act.  Subtypes of Status Dogs  * \\"Weapon Dogs\\" - referring to dogs who are used by their owners to intimidate or inflict physical harm on others. These dogs are seldom formally trained, and are often direct violations of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991(DDA) and the Guard Dogs Act 1975, which stipulate specific requirements for the care of such dogs.Hughes, G., Maher, J., & Lawson, C. (2011). Status dogs, young people and criminalisation: towards a preventative strategy. * \\"Dangerous Dogs\\" - a legal term referring to dogs that are 'dangerously out of control' > A dog shall be regarded as dangerously out of control on any occasion on > which there are grounds for reasonable apprehension that it will injure any > person, whether or not it actually does so, but references to a dog injuring > a person or there being grounds for reasonable apprehension that it will do > so do not include references to any case in which the dog is being used for > a lawful purpose by a constable or a person in the service of the Crown > (section 10(3) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 - DEFRA 2010:3).  Breeding  Although owning and breeding certain types of status dogs is unlawful, people get around this by cross-breeding. Some of the most common motivations for breeding status dogs are profit and the desire to continue a dog's bloodline. The ideal mating age for dogs is 2 to 6 years old. However, more mature females (closer to 6 years old) tend to take better care of their pups, thus ensuring greater puppy health. The ban of specific breeds under the DDA have resulted in numerous crossbreeds, as a means for breeders to avoid legal repercussions. These ambiguous mixes involving illicit breeds have been assigned various pseudonyms. For example, pit bull mixes are often labeled as: * Irish Staff * Long-Legged Staff * Red-Nosed Staff * Staff Cross Often, the buyers of status dogs are not necessarily set on the specific breed. Instead, youths often look mainly at a pup's size, color, and 'potential' when acquiring a status dog, given that they are purchased with the intention of looking tough. Buyers want pups that have the potential to grow large and strong.  Addressing the Situation  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is seeking to reform current legislation regarding dangerous dogs, the ultimate goal being that dogs would be judged solely by their behavior, not by their breed. In his book, Unleashed: The Phenomena of Status Dogs and Weapon Dogs, Harding claims that the issue lies with the lack of education on animal treatment. Harding believes that banning breeds will not solve the status dog trend, and instead the efforts should be focused more on teaching young people how to take good care of animals. The RSCPA is currently working with the status dog unit within the Metropolitan Police for the sake of amending the Dangerous Dogs Act. This would ultimately require public opinion to shift the blame from the dogs to their owners, encouraging the idea that these dogs are not inherently violent, but are abused and trained to be as such.

By virtue of a constitutional amendment, alcohol Prohibition was in effect throughout the United States and trainer William Bringloe was arrested. Arraigned before a Federal Commissioner, the well-known trainer answered the indictment by declaring it was necessary to give a racehorse whisky while in training.

Originals The originals were commissioned as the fronts of andirons or firedogs from the Roman sculptor Alessandro Algardi for Philip IV of Spain by Diego Velasquez in 1650 whilst he was Spanish ambassador to the Italian states, and he ordered four bronzes symbolizing the four elements of the court of Spain. Though they were incomplete on his death and had to be completed by his pupils. He had only completed the first two in a planned set of four before his death and so the other two (Neptune carried by the waters and Cybele carried by the earth) were produced by his children. Philip did not use them as firedogs but as decorative elements for the garden of his Aranjuez Palace. France Other 17th century foundries produced copies for other royal courts, especially the Juno and Jupiter. For example, a set of these two was delivered to the Palace of Versailles in 1684. Louis XIV placed them in niches in the oval salon, but Louis XV passed them to the marquis de Marigny, director of the B√¢timents du roi, who displayed them in the ch√¢teau de M√©nars. After the marquis' death, they were moved to the Louvre in 1795, before being converted to support a pendulum clock at Napoleon's palace of ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud. The two groups were then moved to the palais des Tuileries, where in 1845 they were part- gilded by Charles Christofle. The Juno is now lost, but the Jupiter is now on display in the Louvre. Two similar Juno and Jupiter groups were also owned by the Grand Dauphin, initially displaying them in the ch√¢teau de Choisy then from 1695 in the ch√¢teau de Meudon.

She first worked as a staff nurse in St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin, where she began her lifelong activism in trade unions by joining Irish Women Workers' Union (IWWU). She sat as an IWWU delegate to the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. She was elected president of the union in 1958. In January 1969 she was appointed the union's assistant general secretary, later becoming the general secretary in 1971, succeeding Kay McDowell. Throughout her life, Breslin campaigned for equal rights for women in the workplace and in the trade union movement in Ireland. She sat as a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' (ICTU) women's advisory committee. In 1973 she was elected to the executive of ICTU, the first woman to be elected since the ICTU's foundation in 1959. Breslin was an active member of the \\"equal pay for equal work\\" campaign during the 1960s and 1970s, an issue that was not resolved until a European court ruling. In March 1972, she addressed the commission on the status of women on the topics of equality in the training, recruitment and promotion of women. She particularly focused on the lack of opportunities for young women to take up trade apprenticeships. Throughout the 1970s, Breslin continued to campaign on behalf of those on low wages, targeting large corporate employers such as the Bank of Ireland computer centre. Breslin was forced to retire in 1980 after 3 years of ill health. She unsuccessfully ran for a senate seat on the labour panel in 1981. She died on 10 February 1984.

It is part of the North Cascades Range, a subset of the Cascade Range. Magic Mountain is situated southeast of Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest peak is Pelton Peak to the northeast, and the nearest higher peak is Hurry-up Peak to the south. The Yawning Glacier and Cache Col Glacier rest on its northern flank. Magic Mountain is at the northern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse. Surface runoff on the north side the mountain drains into the Stehekin River, while precipitation drains into the Cascade River from the southwest side. Climate Magic Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Magic Mountain to right The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.
