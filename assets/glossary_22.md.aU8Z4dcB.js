He was considered one of the best surfers in Australia during the early to mid-1970s and was recognised for his deep tube riding skill, especially at Kirra on the Gold Coast, Australia. Peterson was the Australian champion in the years 1972 and 1974, and won many other major surfing competitions. Peterson was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and became publicly known for using illicit drugs.  Youth  Peterson was born in a working-class family and lived in several places; the family eventually settled in Coolangatta, when Peterson was 15 years of age, on Queensland, Australia's Gold Coast. Peterson lived in Coolangatta with his mother, Joan, younger brother, Tommy, and younger sisters, Dorothy (Dot) and Denice. As a young boy, Peterson was involved in surf lifesaving and became a member of the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club; he won many junior titles for swimming. Being a surf lifesaver, also known as a \\"clubbie\\", was unpopular during Peterson's youth; but he received access to a locker and warm shower at the beach and therefore maintained his involvement over subsequent years. The price for Peterson's lifesaving perks was a half-day commitment on surf patrol every month, with a requirement that he wear \\"sluggos\\" and monitor the safety of swimmers. However, Peterson became impatient with the conditions of the role and would arrange for his brother to join him on patrol for company. Peterson commenced surfing on \\"surf-o-planes\\" (an inflated rubber mat device invented in 1932) and then graduated to a board called a \\"Coolite\\" (constructed from a form of polystyrene beaded foam and first introduced at the beginning of the 1970s). During Peterson's upbringing, his family experienced difficulty with income security and his mother worked extremely long hours in a variety of jobs (such as peeling prawns) to support the children. The Peterson boys couldn't afford to own boards of any kind, and were only able to hire or borrow them; either from Billy Rak at Greenmount or Johnny Charlton at Kirra, both of whom ran tourist hire businesses. The two boys were eventually employed by Rak for two summers, setting up and transporting surfboards for tourists. Peterson attained ownership of his first surfboard in 1966, when he retrieved broken and abandoned boards that had been washed up on the rocks at Greenmount Beach. As leg ropes had not yet been introduced, surfers would lose their boards relatively easily and frequently, leaving people like Peterson to collect what remained. The brothers would take the remnants home, make rough repairs and then return to the water to try out their rejuvenated boards. It was during this time that the Peterson boys discovered another advantage of surf club membership; weekend surfers from Brisbane would leave their boards at the club during the week, enabling the brothers to choose from a wide selection of items for their own unpermitted use. In September 1967, around the time of Peterson's 15th birthday, the family moved to units in Tweed St, Coolangatta, and the boys set up a board shaping bay underneath. On the premise that surfboards would be less expensive to make than buy, the brothers sought out resin and fibreglass offcuts from local factories. For the creation of a \\"blank\\" (a foam core component that is re-modelled into a specific surfboard shape), Peterson would extract them from old longboards. Like the Petersons, many of the local kids could not afford to purchase new surfboards either and the home-based business consequently flourished through meeting this demand, eventually expanding to the garage of Peterson's friend, Peter Townend Unknowingly, the cut-downs that the Peterson's were making placed them at the centre of the shortboard revolution. 8-foot boards would be cut down to 6 feet, 8 inches, or to 6-foot, or right down to 5 feet, 1 inch (although, they soon realised that they had gone too far with the smallest measurement when they were overwhelmed by the big waves at Kirra. The shortest length that they ever constructed was 4 feet, 3 inches, for their friend, Kerry Gill, who actually found that the model suited him. Peterson's first new board, a board that he perceived as \\"proper\\", was attained in 1968. His mother offered to buy him a new surfboard if Peterson won the Greenmount Surf Lifesaving Club championship. With Peterson's consistent competitive drive spurred on by such an offer, he was a convincing winner; two weeks later, Peterson received a 7 feet, 11 inches board from local shaper, Ken Gudenswager.  Morning of the Earth  In February 1971, Australian surf filmmaker, Alby Falzon, was filming for Morning of the Earth on the Gold Coast; the time period is known for some of the most significant swell ever seen at the history of the location (12 continuous weeks in which the waves rarely measured below \\"head height\\"). Previously, Falzon had published a picture of Peterson in the magazine, Tracks (co-founded and published by Falzon), accompanied by an article about the \\"underground\\" Gold Coast scene; on the day of the Tracks photograph, Falzon happened to be filming at Kirra, Queensland, while Peterson was exposing his talent on a surfboard. The result of the February 1971 filming session was a three-minute sequence that was included in Morning of the Earth, while numerous were printed in Tracks. The photograph of Peterson that gained the most attention became known as \\"the cutback\\"‚Äîit featured Peterson, tall and muscular, with his long hair flying, executing a \\"cutback\\" manoeuvre at Kirra. The \\"cutback\\" picture became the cover for the July 1972 issue of Tracks, following the release of the film. Peterson did not attend the local premiere of Morning of the Earth on 10 January 1972. Peterson's mother, Joan, transported him to the hall at Miami High (his old school) where the premier was occurring, but Peterson balked at being the \\"centre of attention\\" and both returned home. Peterson's nervousness at presentations and gatherings would be a repeat occurrence on numerous occasions in the future. One of Peterson's secrets for surfing barrels at Kirra was the \\"rocker\\" (underside curvature) design used in his boards. Rather than lifting the nose near the end of the board, Peterson transferred the apex closer to the middle of the board and would ride with one foot either side of the apex. By shifting his weight onto the back foot, the rear of the board would be receive the primary emphasis and the board would stall as a result; this would allow Peterson to slow down to re-enter deeper into the tube. Then, shifting weight forward onto the nose of the surfboard would lead to the board shooting forward. Peterson revealed to Mike Perry, who shaped surfboards alongside him for a period of time, that \\"It's just like cheating, man.\\"  Early contests  In 1971, Peterson won the Kirra Pro-Am contest, the first Queensland contest to offer any prize money (A$150); following this, Peterson also won the Queensland Titles, the final round of which was at Kirra. The Queensland Titles victory earned Peterson a starting place in the Australian Titles that was held at Bells Beach, Victoria, Australia (incorporated into the Bells Beach Classic); however, Peterson competed poorly at Bells Beach, with his narrow board unsuited to the broader waves. Meanwhile, in Coolangatta, the police had commenced an unofficial campaign to change the standards of the beaches according to orders that they had received; this involved getting rid of marijuana and the undesirable types who were not compatible with the family-oriented image that the local chamber of commerce sought to promote. Surfers were a primary target due to the societal perception of the sub-culture and, on occasion, individuals were framed by police officers. By this stage, Peterson had heavily smoked marijuana for a significant period of time and, on 24 January 1972, was arrested for \\"possession\\" and \\"supply\\"; Peterson was fortunate and received a A$500 fine instead of a three-month prison sentence. Involvement with the legal system temporarily curbed Peterson's marijuana habit, but it was not long before he resumed smoking. Peterson found relaxation in marijuana use‚Äîone of the few things that could ameliorate what have later been identified as early symptoms of his schizophrenia. In subsequent years, Peterson was well known for smoking \\"joints\\" (rolled marijuana cigarettes) before or after surfing, and even before contests. Others might have found that the drug made it too difficult to concentrate properly, but Peterson did not seem to experience such a hindrance. In both his younger and older years, Peterson rarely consumed alcohol and was never seen drunk; he was more likely to be stoned and drinking lemonade while his peers were drinking.  Australian champion  In 1972, Peterson successfully defended his Queensland Title, narrowly beating Townend (Townend became known for a high number of \\"second- place\\" finishes during his career.) The win enabled Peterson to compete in the Australian titles again; however, he almost didn't get there due to the under- handed actions of the \\"Windansea\\" surf club. In 1972, Paul Neilsen was the reigning Australian surfing champion, but did not reach the Queensland titles final; therefore, he was unable to defend his Australian title. As a means to overcome such a hindrance, Neilson's club, Windansea, from Surfers Paradise, devised a scheme in which Peterson's drug conviction would be raised at the inter-club meeting to oust Peterson in favour of Neilsen. The meeting eventually descended into chaos and the selections were subject to a vote by the club members; Billy Grant was ultimately omitted from the competition. The 1972 Australian titles were held at North Narrabeen in Sydney. Peterson managed to make it into the final round, but the surfing conditions worsened and the organisers cancelled the final. Peterson was declared the winner, with Townend attaining second place. As a result of his win at North Narabeen, Peterson competed in the 1972 World Titles in San Diego, United States (US). Peterson made it through his first round heat but, due to an error by the judging panel in the second round, Peterson was eliminated.  1973  The Bells Beach Classic in 1973 offered a A$1000 prize, an amount that was very substantial at that time; the event was also run under a new \\"points per manoeuvre\\" system, which had been trialled at the Hang Ten event in Hawaii, US, a few months earlier. The idea was to eliminate subjectivity from judging by only counting the moves that were completed by each contestant. In the first few rounds, under difficult surf conditions, Peterson performed poorly and his total points score left him outside the top ten positions. On the final day at Bells Beach, the leading surfer, Midget Farrelly, was forced to withdraw due to a flu. After transitioning to a larger surfboard, Peterson subsequently won the contest and was amazed when told of his victory. The 1973 Australian titles were held at Margaret River, Western Australia, and the contestants were required to contend with big surf conditions. Although Peterson scored highly in the early rounds, fellow Queenslander, Richard Harvey, emerged victorious and Townend was runner-up. Following his return to the Gold Coast, Peterson engaged in more board shaping work; however, he left Larkin's factory to join Furry Austen, after Austen offered higher remuneration.  1974  1974 was a significant year for Peterson, as it was his most successful in terms of contest results. The year started with a second-place finish to Wayne \\"Rabbit\\" Bartholomew in the Queensland titles. Intense rivals at the time, the loss was Peterson's second to Bartholomew in the Queensland titles event. Peterson then won the Kirra Pro-Am, in a victory that was the start of a renowned run of wins. The next event was the Bells Beach Classic, where Peterson won by a big margin with a tightly controlled performance. The inaugural 2SM/Coca-Cola Surfabout was held in May 1974. A A$2400 first prize was offered by the soft drink sponsor and a new prize record was set for the Australian contest circuit. Surfers from both Australia and the rest of the world competed, including Nat Young, who had otherwise become disillusioned with the contest circuit. Although Townend was in the lead for most of the competition, with a young Mark Richards in second, Peterson eventually won the event. The Australian titles for 1974 were held at Snapper Rocks and Burleigh Heads, and again, Peterson was victorious. In 1974, Townend gave Peterson the nickname \\"MP\\" as a response to Peterson calling Townend \\"PT\\". Townend used the nickname in newspaper columns and it eventually became widely used. Peterson was averse to the nickname in later years, associating it with superficiality; however, the ubiquitous use of the name still persists.  Peterson Surf Shop  In September 1974 Peterson started his Michael Peterson Surfboards business, with a factory in Currumbin next to the Burford Blanks factory, and a shop in Musgrave St, Kirra, right opposite the Kirra beach. His name by then was so big it seemed a sure winner. A caption in the Brisbane Courier Mail wondered if he could be \\"Australia's first millionaire surfer\\". He had a rather inflated idea of his own business acumen, but did have the sense not to try to go it alone, he brought in Paul Hallas as a partner. Hallas was a fellow Kirra surfer and had worked alongside Peterson at Hohensee's factory. They had a total of seven staff and would sell boards up and down the coast, often delivered by Peterson himself in his panel van. Orders for boards soon flooded in, more than they could fill. The boards they supplied were actually more designed for Peterson's level of skill than the average surfer, but the \\"MP\\" label certainly made them sell. The problem was that Peterson wasn't very business minded and would too often sell stock out the back door or treat the business like a personal bank when it was going well. Eventually Hallas despaired and by mutual agreement let himself be bought out by Peterson's mother Joan for just $1000. If run well the business should have been a gold mine, but he thought getting out was the smartest thing to do, and he remained friends with Peterson. Joan took charge, but couldn't much improve the overall operation. She ended up walking away in 1977 when Peterson brought in a girlfriend who Joan strongly disapproved of, and shortly after that the business folded.  Moonrocket (surfboard)  During 1974 and 1975, Peterson shaped a 6'6\\", six-channel triple-flyer pintail at his own factory, a surfboard that became known by several names: the 'Moonrocket', the 'Fangtail' or the 'Christmas Tree'. The fang-like flyers at the back of the board and the finger-deep channels also made it a glasser's nightmare, a role held at Peterson's factory by Peter Evans at the time. The Moonrocket was Peterson's secret weapon for the Pa Bendall contest at the start of 1975, held at Caloundra on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, and Peterson's victory earned him an AUS$2000 prize, continuing his run of success from 1974. The board was later passed to Peter Harris, a young male who worked at Peterson's factory, and was given in lieu of wages owed following the closure of the business. In 1995, Tommy Peterson made a replica of the board and it was presented as the prize for Kelly Slater's win in Australia's Surfing Life magazine's peer poll that year. Illicit drug use Peterson first tried heroin during 1974 and increased his involvement with the drug in 1975. It has been suggested that a vacuum (slightly similar to a \\"demand vacuum\\") had been created in the local drug market as a result of the Queensland Police's attempts to eradicate the Gold Coast's marijuana trade in the operations of previous years. Consequently, a significant number of surfers in the area took heroin and then fatally overdosed on the drug, with professional surfer, Wayne \\"Rabbit\\" Bartholomew, having written about the loss of twelve friends in such a manner. Peterson was phobic regarding hypodermic needles and his preferred mode of administration for heroin was insufflation (commonly known as \\"snorting\\"). Tommy Peterson, who also experienced dependence upon the drug over numerous years, has stated a belief that his brother's fear of injections led to a greatly reduced overdose risk, due to the limited amount of heroin that can be used when employing the insufflation method. During Peterson's heroin-using period, his schizophrenia gradually worsened and his friends reported increasingly erratic behaviour, hostility towards others (including friends) and paranoid delusions in which he believed that others were plotting against him. In retrospect, the symptoms exhibited by Peterson have been identified as typical of the surfer's mental disorder; at the time, though, friends and acquaintances attributed the unusual behaviour to excessive drug use. Friends have since expressed regret at the low level of support they offered Peterson at the time.  Late career  At the start of 1976, Peterson went to New Zealand for the first event in the new IPS professional world tour; although, many of his well-known fellow surfers chose to participate in Hawaii's more prestigious Duke contest. Peterson won the event, but Townend was the eventual winner of the series that year. In 1977, the inaugural Stubbies contest, organised by Peter Drouyn, was held at Burleigh Heads. Drouyn had devised a \\"man on man\\" heats system for the contest, a system that is used in ASP World Tour contests today. Peterson comfortably reached the semi-final round, in which he competed against Bartholomew. Scoring was based on the entire heat and the judges were split in their final decision; however, Peterson attained the winning score; the decision was a contentious topic for many years afterwards. The final placed Peterson in competition against a young Mark Richards and Peterson eventually won the AUS$5,000 prize after a close match. The Stubbies event was Peterson's last major contest victory. Peterson subsequently lived a reclusive lifestyle, alternating between periods of illicit drug use and abstinence. Peterson reportedly camped at the base of Mount Warning, along with health food, to achieve a period of abstinence and detoxification. His solicitor later stated in a court case that Peterson had tried to detoxify on approximately 30 occasions. Peterson did surf intermittently during those years and also commenced windsurfing as an alternative recreational pursuit.  The chase  On the evening of 9 August 1983, Peterson was travelling to Noosa to windsurf the next day. He pulled up at Beenleigh, south of Brisbane, to sleep but was startled by a police car with its siren blaring; the occurrence set Peterson into a panic and he speedily drove away. He had not realised the police car was actually going in the opposite direction and the police officer consequently pursued Peterson, with 20 police cars eventually joining the chase. Peterson mounted the footpath at one point, as the high-speed chase proceeded the vast distance to Brisbane, where a further 15 police cars formed a roadblock on the Story Bridge; the roadblock caused Peterson to stop. The pursuit later appeared on the national Australian news and became known in surfing circles as \\"the chase\\". Following the incident, Peterson was held overnight in a cell at Beenleigh, prior to being taken to Boggo Road Gaol. The police presumed that he was drug-affected and confiscated his car, The Falcon, for the purpose of a search. Vitamin C tablets, part of Peterson's intermittent healthy eating regimes, were the only item that was uncovered. The car was eventually sent to the wreckers and Peterson received a year-long prison sentence, in addition to being banned from driving for life. The presiding judge also ordered a psychiatric report but a diagnosis was not revealed. Peterson began his sentence at Boggo Road and was present during some of the institution's infamous riots. Peterson's mother lobbied her local state MP, the justice minister and the minister in charge of prisons to obtain medical assistance for her son; as a result, Peterson was eventually moved to Wacol Prison Hospital on 25 December 1983 for psychiatric treatment. His schizophrenia was diagnosed many years after onset and he received Mellaril medication. Peterson also consented to electroshock treatments and received two sessions. Following his release from prison, Peterson returned to the Gold Coast and resided between care facilities and his mother's house. The prescribed medication helped considerably, but Peterson lived mostly as a recluse, rarely seeking out the company of former friends. A poor diet, combined with the psychiatric medication (especially Clozaril), caused Peterson's weight to increase to a point where he was scarcely recognisable. Like many schizophrenics, Peterson heard voices and he reported the voices as being \\"friendly\\".  Later life  Throughout 2002 and 2003, Peterson co-operated with surf writer and Tracks editor, Sean Doherty, on a biography of his life, establishing veracity to the conjecture that had thus far defined the public's knowledge of the surfer's life. Peterson had been healthy enough in the years previous to attend several surf functions, including a contest organised by the Kirra Surfriders club in 2002, called the \\"MP Classic\\", held in his honour. The \\"MP Classic\\" raised approximately AUS$10,000 with the proceeds distributed to various local mental health services, including those that had supported Peterson. Peterson had not surfed since the mid-1980s, but revealed to Doherty: \\"I haven't given it away! Who told you that? Is that what's getting around?\\". Peterson's friends strongly supported Peterson's return to surfing and, according to Bartholomew, many of his peers had not stopped surfing at that point in time. Death On 29 March 2012, Peterson died of a heart attack whilst inside his Australian home at Tweed Heads South, New South Wales; he was 59 years of age. Peterson was honored with a memorial service at Kirra. Mick Fanning, Rabbit Bartholomew and Kelly Slater were in attendance. Doug 'Claw' Warbrick spoke at the send off.

He was unable to secure the release of the cargo. History In 1933, a Danish consulate was established in Tehran which was later upgraded to an embassy. Also in 1933, with the arrival of Danish engineers in Iran, technical cooperation commenced. In the same year a contract was signed with the Danish engineering firm of Kampsax A/S to construct the trans-Iranian railway line.

More specifically, the mission in Copenhagen was launched on 19 February 1959 and Ali Asghar Nase was appointed Iranian ambassador. The 2006 Muhammad cartoons controversy saw the Danish embassy to Iran attacked by protesters and the Iranian Ambassador to Denmark called to Tehran; thus straining political and economic interaction between the two countries. In 2010, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Director General for Northeastern Europe Behnam Behrouz and the Deputy Danish Foreign Minister Anne Steffensen spoke of expanded commercial ties. Steffensen said \\"Danish companies will be encouraged to boost their activities in Iran's market and we hope that the resolution of Iran and the West's nuclear standoff would pave the way for further expansion of ties in all areas.\\" She also said the US- backed sanctions on Iran would have no bearing on bilateral economic relations.Iran, Denmark mull expansion of ties On 30 October 2018, the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (DSIS) announced that they suspect Iranian Intelligence agencies was operating in Denmark, and that they were planning to kill the leader of ASMLA, who lives there.

Modulation order can only be defined for digital modulations. The simplest forms of digital modulation are of second order because they can transmit only two symbols (usually denoted as \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" or as \\"-1\\" and \\"1\\"). They are called binary shift keying (BSK). Modulations which have an order of 4 and above usually are termed as higher-order modulations. Examples of these are quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and its generalisation as m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM). Because existing computers and automation systems are based on binary logic most of the modulations have an order which is a power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. In principle, however, the order of a modulation can be any integer greater than one. When the order of a digital modulation approaches infinity its properties approach those of the respective analog modulation. Thus the analogue modulations can be viewed as extreme cases of higher-order digital modulations for which the order is equal to infinity.

The tunnel is long and reaches below mean sea level. It carries three lanes of European Road E39 and is part of the Triangle Link, a fixed link which connects Sunnhordland to Haugaland. Plans for the tunnel arose in the 1980s; construction started in 1997 and the tunnel opened on 27 December 2000. The tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method, with two teams building from each end. The tunnel runs through an area composed mostly of gneiss, phyllite and greenstone. The tunnel was the longest subsea tunnel in Norway until the opening of Karm√∏ytunnelen. It is still (2013) the deepest point on the E-road network. The tunnel was a toll road from the opening until 30 April 2013. In 2012 the tunnel had an average 4,084 vehicles per day. Planning The background for the Triangle Link was the desire to have a fixed link between the islands of Stord and B√∏mlo. The first documented proposals were made in the 1960s and involved building a pontoon bridge across Stokksundet.Hauge: 32 Following the 1982 opening of the Vard√∏ Tunnel‚Äîthe first subsea tunnel in Norway‚ÄîEngineer Finn Nitter d.e. proposed a fixed link between the two islands. It would have crossed Digernessundet on a suspension bridge and continued along a causeway and low bridge onwards to a subsea tunnel under Spiss√∏ysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet. In addition, a long tunnel would have been built from F√∏yno to Ulver√•ker in Sveio.Hauge: 34 The company Johannes S√∏rlie launched an all-tunnel proposal in 1985, estimated to cost 700 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and which would have resulted in of subsea tunnel connecting B√∏mlo, Stord and the mainland. An inter-municipal committee was positive to the proposals, while Josef Martinsen, director of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, stated that the project was unrealistic. The limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS (SBT) was founded in October 1986 by the municipal authorities of B√∏mlo, Stord, Fitjar and Sveio, Hordaland County Municipality and five banks.Hauge: 35 In December 1986, the Public Roads Administration recommended a bridge.Hauge: 36 A report published by SBT in 1987 considered detailed plans for a subsea tunnel to the mainland, which was followed up by seismic surveys in the fjord. SBT changed its name to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link.Hauge: 37 The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge, as it would interfere with ship traffic.Hauge: 38 On 26 June 1987, SBT's board decided to work towards getting permission to collect advance tolls on the ferry services.Hauge: 39 On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK 660 million.Hauge: 40 This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take a longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.Hauge: 42 From 1988, environmental groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the local chapter of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of F√∏yno and Naut√∏y. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge.Hauge: 49 Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public.Hauge: 51 Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in B√∏mlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern B√∏ml√∏, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.Hauge: 52 The Triangle Link was passed by the various municipal councils in February and March 1988.Hauge: 44Hauge: 45 Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that two and a half years of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langev√•g‚ÄìBuav√•g Ferry, which connected to southern B√∏mlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated.Hauge: 46 During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not supported by the national government and the issue placed on hold.Hauge: 47 In July 1992, the master plan was passed by the Council of State.Hauge: 59 On 10 December 1992, Parliament approved advanced payment of tolls on the ferry, which were made effective from 1 January 1993. Ticket prices increased by between NOK 10 and 12. This resulted in protests from the ferry employees who stated that they would have to collect the tolls which would remove their jobs; Norwegian Seafarers' Union representatives stated that they considered suing the state.Hauge: 60 Work on the development plan started in 1992. It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project's cost by NOK 200 million, and it was made subject to consultative statements in May 1994. A report on the Coastal Highway (E39) was published in 1995, which recommended that the Skjersholmane‚ÄìValev√•g Ferry be removed.Hauge: 62 Following a dispute regarding the impact of the bridge landing on Stord, SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise to avoid developing a new plan which could have postponed the project several years. On 11 June 1996, Parliament decided with 144 against 20 votes to build the Triangle Link.Hauge: 64 The original name proposed for the tunnel was (\\"The Portal to Sunnhordland\\"), but this was changed to .Hauge: 68 Construction Overview of the Triangle Link area as seen from B√∏mlo Geological sampling was undertaken by the Norwegian Geological Survey and Gr√∏ner, and included both core samples and reflection seismology.Hauge: 156 Late core samples showed that the tunnel would have to be located further down than originally planned to avoid deposits.Hauge: 67 The tunnel construction was awarded to two companies: the contract starting from Dalshovda in Sveio and was worked by the Public Roads Administration, while the tunneling from F√∏yno was worked by NCC. Both used the drilling and blasting method.Hauge: 108 NCC was awarded the contract after bidding NOK 175 million for the job. Construction from Sveio started on 16 September 1997 and from F√∏yno on 6 March 1998. In all, of earthwork was extracted. The earthwork from the F√∏yno side was transported by barge to Austevoll and used to build the Austevoll Bridge. The earthwork from the Sveio side was used to build roads and a golf course in the area. On average, the tunnel was built at a speed of per week, with the record being . Between 30 and 40 people worked with the tunneling on each team. The lowest point was reached on 5 May 1999 and the breakthrough took place on 2 September 1999, five months before schedule. Construction involved injection of and spraying of of gunite.Hauge: 109 The tunnel was budgeted to cost NOK 496 million, but ended up costing NOK 487 million. It opened along with the Stord Bridge on 27 December 2000. Six hours before the opening, the bottom of the tunnel was used for a wedding.Hauge: 88 The toll company held a course for people with fear of tunnels to master their fears, with 60 people participating.Hauge: 90 The official opening took place on 30 April 2001.Hauge: 15 When it opened, it was the longest and second-deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway, after the Hitra Tunnel. Specifications Map of the Triangle Link The B√∏mlafjord Tunnel is long and crosses B√∏mlafjorden as part of European Route E39. To the southeast, the tunnel begins at Dalshovda in Sveio. It runs under B√∏mlafjord, then passes below the island of Otter√∏ya and continues under the fjord again before ending on the island of F√∏yno.Hauge: 157 The tunnel is wide and has three lanes. As the tunnel has a significant slope, two lanes runs uphill and one runs downhill. It has a height of and has its deepest point at below mean sea level. Safety measures include fire extinguishers, emergency telephones and break-down pullovers every . There are turning points for trucks every and lights and barriers at the entrances to notify drivers if the tunnel is closed. It features radio coverage and a system to register the position and key information about all vehicles in the tunnel. All the emergency equipment is connected to the Public Roads Administrations centre in Bergen. The tunnel has mobile telephone coverage. In 2016, the tunnel had an average 4,974 vehicles per day. The Triangle Link was partially financed with tolls, with toll collection located at F√∏yno. It was constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the toll plaza once. As of 2011, the fees were NOK 85 for cars and NOK 270 for trucks. Frequent travellers could prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. The tolls were removed in April 2013 since the tunnel got paid off. The tunnel runs through an area with complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsn√∏y Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the creation of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsn√∏y Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otter√∏ya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.Hauge: 158 References ;Bibliography * ;Notes Category:Road tunnels in Vestland Category:Former toll tunnels Category:Subsea tunnels in Norway Category:European Route E39 in Norway Category:2000 establishments in Norway Category:Tunnels completed in 2000 Category:Stord Category:Sveio ","title":"B√∏mlafjord Tunnel"},{"id":"4449532","text":"Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz () is the capital of the Neumarkt district in the administrative region of the Upper Palatinate, in Bavaria, Germany. With a population of about 40,000, Neumarkt is the seat of various projects, and acts as the economic and cultural center of the western Upper Palatinate, along with N√ºrnberg, Ingolstadt, and Regensburg. Geography Neumarkt lies on the western edge of the Franconian Jura, nestled in a valley. The municipal region reaches as far as the Bavarian Jura to the east. The Neumarkt valley drains to the north through the Schwarzach River, a tributary of the Regnitz, eventually flowing into the Main, and to the south through the Sulz, a tributary of the Altm√ºhl, which eventually flows into the Danube. The Ludwig Canal cuts through the area from North to South, bridging the European water divide. The elevation varies from 406 meters on the Beckenm√ºhle River to the north, to 595 meters in the vicinity of Fuchsberg; as a reference, the elevation of city hall is given as 423 meters. The municipal region has an area of 73.09 km¬≤. The following municipalities, all of which belong to the Neumarkt district, border the district capital. They are named clockwise, beginning in the north: Berg, Pilsach, Velburg, Deining, Sengenthal, Berngau and Postbauer-Heng. Geology Neumarkt is located on the western edge of a former Coral Reef (now called the Franconian Jura) of the Tethys Ocean during the Jurassic. The floor of the valley is predominately sandy, whence came the earlier name Neumarkt auf dem Sand (Neumarkt on the Sand), on the sides are isolated regions of loam. The mountains are formed of hard Limestone containing numerous springs, including, for example, the source of the White Laber River near Voggenthal. Municipal subdivision The core of the municipal area is the Old City and its still-recognized borders. The first housing developments built outside the city walls began in 1850 to the east, along M√ºhlstra√üe, Mariahilfstra√üe, and Badstra√üe. To the south, the Industrial area developed beginning around 1920. After 1945, the city expanded to the north and west, and eventually grew together with the municipalities of Woffenbach and Holzheim. Numerous other settlements developed around the city center, named, going clockwise from the north: Altenhof, Koppenm√ºhle, Kohlenbrunnerm√ºhle, M√ºhlen, Wolfstein (at the site of the former Prison Work Camp), Weinberg, Schlosserh√ºgel, and Hasenheide. During the 1972 Municipality Reforms, nine municipalities were merged with the city, substantially increasing the municipal area. History Traces of the earliest settlement at Neumarkt go back as far as the Neolithic period. Around Neumarkt there are numerous burial mounds and multiple Celtic embankments. The town is assumed to have been first founded by the Bavarii in the 6th or 7th century, for example, the quarter of the city now named P√∂lling. The precise date of the city's founding is unknown, but its founding as \\"neuer Markt\\" is assumed to have happened in the beginning of the 12th century, on the trade route between Nuremberg and Regensburg. The city was first mentioned in a document in 1135, and city fortifications were mentioned for the first time in 1315. In the 13th century Emperor Frederick II granted Neumarkt Reichsfreiheit, and with it, the right to collect customs on trade between Nuremberg and Regensburg and itself. However, the city never enforced this status, because the city fell to the Wittelsbachs in 1329 through the Treaty of Pavia. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Neumarkt was the residence of the rulers of the Palatinate. Count Johann von Pfalz-Neumarkt established the seat of his government here, and began to develop the city into a residency. Included in his work are the church of St. Johannes, the Court Chapel, and the castle of the counts of the Palatinate. Johann was succeeded by Counts Otto I, his son Otto II, and Frederick II, who later became an Elector, and moved to Heidelberg. A panorama of castle ruin Wolfstein, March 2013 After the Palatinate Counts left, Neumarkt lost much of its importance. Subsequently, the city played a part in political and economic life only for the surrounding area, and the growth of the city stopped almost entirely. The next perceptible period of growth did not occur until the middle of the 19th century. In the Thirty Years' War, Neumarkt was occupied by Swedish troops from 1633 to 1635 and from 1646 to 1649. Both times the city was plundered and partially destroyed. Castle of the Palatinate Counts During the war of the First Coalition a dramatic encounter between the French and Austria troops occurred in Neumarkt in the Summer of 1796. The French barricaded themselves in the city and the Austrians began its complete destruction. Only through the intervention of a smith from Neumarkt, who single-handedly opened the upper gate, was something worse averted. Neumarkt attained the status of Bavarian imperial city, and was the seat of a district court after the Kingdom of Bavaria was formed by Napoleon in 1806. In the 19th century Neumarkt gradually developed into an industrial center. Beginning in 1830, thousands of laborers worked on the Ludwigskanal in the vicinity of Neumarkt, the completion of which, in 1846, made Neumarkt a port city. The Express-Werken, established in Neumarkt in 1884, were continental Europe's first bicycle factory. The economic and political results of World War I were quickly noticeable in Neumarkt. Over 300 of its young men fell on the battlefield. The remains of the former Dietrich Eckart memorial in Neumarkt, covered in both neo-Nazi and anti-Nazi graffiti In September 1923 one of the first local chapters of the Nazi Party was founded in Neumarkt, which appeared publicly on September 23 for \\"German Day\\". The chapter was created shortly before the death of Dietrich Eckart, one of the founders of the Nazi party, who was born in Neumarkt. The removal of active party members, however, led to its quick disintegration. The party was not reorganized in Neumarkt until 1928. In 1934, in memory of Eckart, the town was officially given the added suffix \\"Dietrich-Eckart-city\\". In that year, Adolf Hitler inaugurated a monument in Eckart's honour in the city park.Georges van Vrekhem, Hitler and His God: The Background of the Hitler Phenomenon, Rupa & Company, 2006, p.58. It has since been rededicated to Christopher of Bavaria (1416-1448), King of Denmark, who was probably born in the town. Business The Lammsbr√§u Brewery is located in the town.

Biography Ferry Carondelet was born in Mechelen, Flanders, to a rich, bourgeois and influential family originally from Dole. He grew up in Burgundy, at the time a Habsburg province under Emperor Maximilian I, and matriculated at the University of Franche-Comt√©, where he took clerical orders. In 1504 he was named Archdeacon of the Besan√ßon church. In 1508 Ferry Carondelet became confessor (church advisor) to Margaret of Austria, the regent of the Spanish Netherlands, and incidentally to her ward, the future Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V . In 1510 he was made Papal Legate to the court of Emperor Maximilian. In 1515 he returned to Burgundy and became the abbot of the Saint Columbanus abbey in Montbeno√Æt. Ferry Carondelet is known as a major benefactor of the Montbeno√Æt abbey and the cathedral in Besan√ßon. He commissioned the Italian painter Fra Bartolomeo to create the Carondelet Altar for Besan√ßon, and he completely rebuilt the church for the Montbeno√Æt abbey. He died on 27 June 1528 and is buried in a marble tomb in the Cathedrale Saint Jean in Besan√ßon.

General Overview  In a nutshell, SLIP consisted of a set of FORTRAN \\"accessor\\" functions which operated on circular doubly linked lists with fixed-size data fields. The \\"accessor\\" functions had direct and indirect addressing variants.  List Representation  The list representation had four types of cell: a reader, a header, a sublist indicator, and a payload cell. The header included a reference count field for garbage collection purposes. The sublist indicator allowed it to be able to represent nested lists, such as (A, B, C, (1, 2, 3), D, E, F) where (1, 2, 3) is a sublist indicated by a cell in the '*' position in the list (A, B, C, *, D, E, F). The reader was essentially a state history stack‚Äîa good example of a memento pattern‚Äîwhere each cell pointed to the header of the list being read, the current position within the list being read, and the level or depth of the history stack.

Born in New York City, de Wolfe was acutely sensitive to environment from her earliest years, and became one of the first women interior designers, replacing heavy Victorian styles with light, intimate effects and uncluttered room layouts. Her marriage to English diplomat Sir Charles Mendl was seen as one of convenience, though she was proud to be called Lady Mendl, and her lifelong companion was Elisabeth Marbury, with whom she lived in New York and Paris.

Career  Elsie de Wolfe, photograph from The House in Good Taste, 1913 According to The New Yorker, \\"Interior design as a profession was invented by Elsie de Wolfe\\". She was certainly the most famous name in the field until the 1930s, but the profession of interior decorator/designer was recognized as a promising one as early as 1900,Candee, Helen Churchill, How Women May Earn a Living, New York: Macmillan & Co, 1900, pp. 103-105. five years before she received her first official commission, the Colony Club in New York.

Through her efforts, American homes were introduced to a succession of sophisticated yet simple ideas, generally based on her preference for late 18th-century French style. Bessie Marbury and Elsie de Wolfe (from My Crystal Ball, 1923) Many elements aided her in becoming such an influential figure in the emerging field ‚Äî her social connections, her reputation as an actress and her success in decorating the interior of the Washington Irving House, the residence she shared with her close friend, Elisabeth Marbury. Washington Irving House, New York City, New York Preferring a brighter scheme of decorating than was fashionable in Victorian times, she helped convert interiors featuring dark, heavy draperies and overly ornate furnishings into light, soft, more feminine rooms. She made a feature of mirrors, which both illuminated and expanded living spaces, brought back into fashion furniture painted in white or pale colors, and indulged her taste for chinoiserie, chintz, green and white stripes, wicker, trompe-l'oeil effects in wallpaper, and trelliswork motifs, suggesting the allure of the garden. As de Wolfe claimed: \\"I opened the doors and windows of America, and let the air and sunshine in.\\" Her inspiration came from 18th-century French and English art, literature, theater, and fashion. De Wolfe's taste was also practical, eliminating in her schemes the clutter that occupied Victorian homes, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. She also popularized the chaises longue, faux-finish treatments, and animal print upholstery. In 1905, Stanford White, the architect for the Colony Club and a longtime friend, helped de Wolfe secure the commission for its interior design. The building, located at 120 Madison Avenue (near 30th Street), would become the premier women's social club on its opening two years later, much of its appeal owing to the interiors de Wolfe arranged. Instead of the heavy, masculine overtones then pervasive in fashionable interiors, de Wolfe used light fabric for window coverings, painted walls pale colors, tiled the floors, and added wicker chairs and settees. The effect centered on the illusion of an outdoor garden pavilion. (The building is now occupied by the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.) The success of the Colony Club proved a turning point in her own life and career, launching her fame as the most sought-after interior decorator of the day.Gray, Christopher (2003), \\"Streetscapes/Former Colony Club at 120 Madison Avenue; Stanford White Design, Elsie de Wolfe Interior,\\" The New York Times, September 28, 2003 Over the course of the next six years, de Wolfe designed interiors for many prestigious private homes, clubs, and businesses on both the East and West coasts. By 1913, her reputation had grown so that her studio took up an entire floor of offices on 5th Avenue. That year she received her greatest commission ‚Äî from coal magnate Henry Clay Frick, one of the richest men in America at the time. Marriage and family Elsie de Wolfe in Red Cross volunteer uniform, from a 1919 publication. De Wolfe's 1926 marriage to diplomat Sir Charles Mendl, the British press attache in Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/magazine/at-long-last-love.html was page-one news in the New York Times. The marriage was platonic and one of convenience.\\"Lady Mendl\\" was frequently used by the press during her married life. \\"Elsie de Wolfe\\" is the name that appears as author of her published books; modern biographers usually use this form of the name. \\"Lady Elsie de Wolfe Mendl\\" is mentioned by The Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, volume 20, Gale Group, 2000. \\"Ella Anderson de Wolfe\\" is given by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as her name \\"in full,\\" adding \\"married name 'Lady Mendl'\\" The pair appeared to have married primarily for social amenities, entertaining together but keeping separate residences. In 1935, when de Wolfe published her autobiography, she didn't mention her husband in it.Franklin, Ruth (September 27, 2004), \\"A Life in Good Taste: The Fashions and Follies of Elsie de Wolfe.\\" The New Yorker . (\\"according to Hilda West, de Wolfe‚Äôs longtime secretary, de Wolfe had simply decided she wanted a title). Although his career had been of no great distinction, Mendl's knighthood was allegedly bestowed due to his retrieval of letters from a gigolo who had been blackmailing Prince George, Duke of Kent.King, Francis Henry \\"Yesterday came suddenly: an autobiography\\", Constable, 1993, p278 The Times reported \\"the intended marriage comes as a great surprise to her friends,\\" a veiled reference to the fact that since 1892 de Wolfe had been living openly in what many observers accepted as a lesbian relationship with Miss Elizabeth Marbury. First, the two lived at 49 Irving Place, and then, 13 Sutton Place. As the paper put it: \\"When in New York she makes her home with Miss Elizabeth Marbury at 13 Sutton Place.\\" The daughter of a prosperous New York lawyer, Elisabeth (Bessy) Marbury, like de Wolfe, was also a pioneer career woman. She was one of the first female theater agents and one of the first woman Broadway producers. Her clients included Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. During their nearly 40 years together, Marbury was initially the main support of the couple. David Von Drehle speaks of \\"the willowy De Wolfe and the masculine Marbury ... cutting a wide path through Manhattan society. Gossips called them \\"the Bachelors.\\" p. 494 (\\"famous lesbian relationship... openly received...\\") p. 204 (\\"Miss Marbury... was the lesbian lover of Elsie De Wolfe...\\") \\"willowy Dewolfe and the masculine Marbury...\\" p. 72Curtis, Charlotte (1982), \\"A Decorative Collaboration.\\" The New York Times . (\\"Miss Marbury was born to a fortune she herself enhanced. Her attachment to Miss de Wolfe lasted more than 40 years, during which time Miss Marbury paid more than half of their shared household expenses.\\") Expecting nothing to change in their relationship due to her marriage to Mendl, de Wolfe remained Marbury's lover until the latter's death in 1933. p. 124 (\\"Mendl...assured the enraged Marbury that he had no intentions of replacing her in de Wolfe's affections, and that marriage was purely one of convenience, and that perhaps as a business woman she could understand the social and commercial value of such a contract.

New-York Tribune (April 5, 1903). She described herself as an \\"antisarcophagist\\", neither a red meat eater nor wholly vegetarian. De Wolfe advocated gardening and consuming homegrown vegetables and organic food. In her later years, de Wolfe embraced a vegetarian diet and was supervised by nutritionist Gayelord Hauser.Sparke, Penny; Wolfe, Elsie De; Owens, Mitchell. (2005).

Plot Richard Thayer, a shy, unassuming man (Valentino), is in love with a sheltered young woman, Elizabeth (\\"Beth\\") Lane (Myers). While the feelings are mutual and Richard wishes to propose, he can never find a moment to speak to Beth alone‚Äîshe is constantly surrounded by admirers and her overprotective father (Wadsworth Harris). Richard explains his predicament to his friends, young married couple William and Maude Harcourt (Charles Dorian and Mary Warren). They agree to help by hosting Richard and Beth at a private dinner at their home. Beth's father agrees to let her dine with the Harcourts, but insists that she keep to an 11:00 curfew. The evening of the dinner William Harcourt receives a telegram from a prospective business associate, Bradford (William Dyer), informing him that he is arriving that night for a surprise visit. The announcement throws the Harcourts into a panic. William has recently mortgaged his home and life savings to buy a copper mine; he is counting on a $1-million investment from Bradford to save his business and house. He does not have any servants to welcome the millionaire, having fired them earlier in the day in a fit of rage. Working together, the four friends devise a plan: Richard and Beth will pose as the Harcourts; the real Harcourts will play the servants because they are familiar with the layout of their house. The scheme initially works, but things quickly deteriorate when Bradford, an eccentric, overbearing man, starts flirting with Maude Harcourt and insisting that Richard and Beth turn in for the night. The situation worsens when Beth misses her curfew and her father shows up at the Harcourt home to look for her. Eventually, everything is solved, but not before Col.

It seems strange producers don't make more pictures along these lines.\\" He went on to summarize its plot and concluded with, \\"The picture contains no offensive scenes.

In contrast to the screen persona of \\"The Great Lover\\", his character of Richard Thayer is shy and insecure. For this film, Valentino performed several scenes of physical comedy and pratfalls, including falling from a window into a barrel of water. Valentino and Myers starred together previously in A Society Sensation, also directed by Paul Powell. Powell praised Valentino's work. Valentino recalled to Photoplay, \\"He was the first to say, 'Stick to it and you'll make a name for yourself.'\\" Re-release Poster for the 1922 re-release Poster for the 1922 re-release Unlike the re-releases of early Valentino films A Society Sensation and Stolen Moments, the original length of All Night was kept intact. Re-release advertisements described Valentino's role as that of an \\"ideal lover\\" and the story as \\"a throbbing romance of love, beauty, and daring\\". These descriptions can't be farther from the truth and were only meant to capitalize on Valentino's new image as the \\"Great Lover\\".

History  The first church on Sheshan hill was built in 1863. During the Taiping Rebellion, Jesuit missionaries bought a plot of land on the southern slopes of the hill. A derelict Buddhist monastery had stood on the site. The remaining buildings were demolished, and a small building was constructed as living quarters for missionaries, and a small chapel. At the peak of the hill (where the Maitreya hall had stood), a small pavilion was built in which was placed a statue of the Madonna. In June 1870, unrest in Tianjin led to the burning of churches there. The Shanghai Jesuits prayed at the statue of the Madonna and pledged to build a church to her honor in return for her protection. Subsequently, construction of a church designed by the French Jesuit brother L√©on Mariot (È¶¨ÂéÜËÄÄ Ma Liyao, 1830-1902) began on 1871. Wood was shipped in from Shanghai, and stone bought from Fujian. All material had to be ported to the peak by hand. The church was completed two years later. This first church was in the form of a cross, and incorporated features of both Chinese and Western architecture. A veranda was placed outside the door, with ten columns. Eight stone lions were placed before the church. In 1894, several ancillary buildings were added. These included the mid-level church, a shrine to the Sacred Heart, the Virgin Mary, and St. Joseph. Fourteen Stations of the Cross were constructed along the path to the church. In 1899-1901, the French Jesuits built an astronomical observatory on the top of the hill, which included a telescope bought by father Stanislas Chevalier (Ëî°Â∞öË≥™ Cai Shangzhi, 1852-1930) in France. In 1920, the existing church was found to be inadequate, and it lagged far behind other churches in Shanghai in terms of size and ornamentation. The Shanghai Jesuits asked the Belgian missionary-architect father Alphonse De Moerloose (ÂíåÁæπÊüè He Gengbo, 1858-1932) to design the plans for a monumental new basilica. After the demolition of the old church in 1923, the new basilica on top of the hill was slowly built from 1924 to 1935, under the daily supervision of the Portuguese Jesuit missionary-architect father Fran√ßois-Xavier Diniz (ËëâËÇáÊòå Ye Zhaochang, 1869-1943). On June 14, 1924, in the context of the Catholic Synod of Shanghai, archbishop Celso Costantini and twenty-five members of the synod climbed on Sheshan hill and solemnly consecrated China to the Virgin Mary. In 1942, Pope Pius XII elevated the Sheshan church to the rank of minor Basilica. In 1946, the Holy See crowned the statue of Our Lady of Zo-s√® at the apex of the tower. Peter Harmsen ('Shanghai 1937 - Stalingrad on the Yangtse') gives an account of the battle around the Basilica during the Chinese retreat from Shanghai. During the Cultural Revolution, Sheshan basilica was severely damaged. The stained glass windows of the church, carvings along the Via Dolorosa, the statue atop the bell tower, and various other works of iconography were destroyed. In the 1950s, Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei the Roman Catholic bishop of Shanghai was arrested and imprisoned for over 30 years and the Chinese government put the basilica under the control of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and Chinese bishops not recognized by the Vatican, and condemned by the papal encyclical Ad Apostolorum principis.Papal encyclical Ad Apostolorum principis After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, the damage was gradually repaired. The statue was initially replaced with a simple iron cross, and a replacement statue was installed in 2000.http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2000/05/05/bronze- marian-statue-installed-at-sheshan-basilica-in-shanghai&post;_id=15948 On May 24, 2008 Pope Benedict XVI announced that he had composed a special prayer for Our Lady of Sheshan.Catholic News http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=58489 Layout The church occupies an area of 1 hectare and is about 70 feet (20 m) tall. It is a rectangular Latin cross in shape, and in classical basilica form. Entrances are placed in the north, west, and south. The main door is in the southwest. The nave is 55.81 m long, 24.68 m wide. The ceiling is 16.46 m high, and the church can seat 3000. The altar is placed at the eastern end, and is built of marble with gold trim and in-laid jade. The exterior is mainly granite, and part of the roof is covered in Chinese-style color-glazed tiles. The bell tower stands on the south-east corner. It is 38 m tall. At the top of its bell tower stands a 4.8m bronze Madonna and Child statue (\\"Our Lady of Zos√®\\"). Other features The 14 Stations of the Cross are situated at the end of each zig-zag path up the steep hill leading to the church. At the mid-level in an open square where there are two shrines, one in devotion to the Sacred Heart and the other to the Virgin Mary. Nearby is the Sheshan Observatory (now Sheshan Station of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory). It was originally built by the Jesuits. Pilgrimage In 1874, Pope Pius IX declared that pilgrims who went to She Shan in May (traditionally a Marian month) would receive a Plenary Indulgence. As a result, pilgrims from all over China began to congregate at She Shan in May, a practice that continues to this day.http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2000/05/05/bronze-marian- statue-installed-at-sheshan-basilica-in-shanghai&post;_id=15948 Every May, the church becomes the destination for pilgrims who travel far and wide to make their annual pilgrimage at Sheshan, praying the Way of the Cross, the Rosary and attending Mass at this holy site. Traditionally, many of the Catholics in the area were fishermen, who would make the pilgrimage by boat. This tradition continues among local Catholics, with the result that the creeks around She Shan are often crowded with boats in May.

It is part of the National Physical Laboratory and its upper two storeys overlook adjoining Bushy Park. The house and of surrounding Bushy Park land were taken as the site for the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1900 after concerns about flooding of the previously proposed site in the Old Deer Park, Richmond; it opened as part of this important laboratory in 1902. The ground floor and basement levels of Bushy House were converted to laboratory space and Richard Glazebrook, the first director of NPL, and later directors, used part of the building as private accommodation. Bushy House contains laboratories, two small museums that mainly contain old scientific equipment, and rooms used for meetings and conferences. History Bushy House in its first form was built in 1663 by William Samwell for Edward Proger, at a cost of ¬£4000 (), as the lodge of the Keeper/Ranger of Bushy Park in what was at the time the North Park part. Proger had been made Ranger of Bushy Park to reward him for his loyalty to King Charles II during his exile.'Spelthorne Hundred: Hampton Court Palace, parks', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2, ed. William Page (London, 1911), pp. 386-388. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol2/pp386-388 Accessed 1 October 2017. It was rebuilt by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax (also spelt Montague) 1714 to 1715 after he had bought the three parks from the Duchess of Cleveland and was made ranger. The house and office then passed to his cousin George Montague (1715‚Äì1737) and then to George's son George Montague-Dunk (1737‚Äì1771). From 1771 to 1792, it was occupied by the grandson of the 1st Earl through his eldest daughter, Lord North, Prime Minister, who had further homes such as in Epsom and the centre of London or Westminster. In 1797, after the death of both Lord North and his wife, King George III appointed his son, William, Duke of Clarence, as Ranger of Bushy Park, carrying with it residence at Bushy House. The future King William IV and his mistress Dorothy Jordan lived there together with their ten children until the couple's relationship came to an end in 1811.Google Books The Story of Dorothy Jordan Armstrong, Clare & Jerrold, Bridgman Ayer Publishing, 1969 , William continued living there with the FitzClarence children and later his wife Princess Adelaide after they married in 1818. When at 6am on 26 June 1830 a messenger from London arrived at Bushy House with the news that the King was dead (so William was now King), he is said to have replied that he had 'always wished to sleep with a queen' and gone back to bed. As William had appointed her Ranger in her own right upon his accession, after William's death in 1837, Bushy House became Adelaide's official residence until her death in 1849. In 1865, Queen Victoria offered Bushy House to the Duc de Nemours and other members of the exiled French royal family as they tried to restore the House of Bourbon. After his return to France in 1871, he kept control of Bushy House until his death in 1896 in case he was forced to leave France again, and with Louis not having children as heirs, the house became empty in 1897. The new National Physical Laboratory was opened at Bushy House by the Prince of Wales (later King George V) in March 1902.

He represented Southampton Test for Labour from 1966 to 1970, and Southampton Itchen for Labour and then the Social Democratic Party from 1971 to 1983.  Early life  Mitchell was born in Southampton on 22 August 1927. He attended Taunton's Grammar School as a youth and graduated from the University of Southampton with a degree in Economics.  Professional life: Education  Mitchell taught mathematics and science at several schools before eventually finding a position as Senior Master and Head of the Mathematics and Science Department of Bartley County Secondary School, becoming Deputy Head in 1965. Mitchell was also an active member of the National Union of Teachers.  Professional life: Politics  Mitchell became active in Labour party politics. He was elected of the Southampton borough council in 1955 and contested the safe Conservative seat of New Forest in the 1959 general election. In the 1964 general election, Mitchell contested Southampton Test, which he lost by a mere 348 votes. However, upon contesting the seat again in the 1966 general election, Mitchell won the seat by over 2,000 votes, propelled by the momentum of the Labour landslide in that election. His hold on Southampton Test would prove to be tenuous. In the Conservative victory in the 1970 general election, Mitchell lost his marginal seat. However, Mitchell was not out of the House of Commons for long. His former Parliamentary neighbour in Southampton Itchen, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Dr. Horace King, was elevated to the House of Lords in late 1970. Mitchell was selected as the Labour candidate for the seat in the resulting by-election in 1971, which he won by a majority of nearly 10,000. Once he returned to the House of Commons, Mitchell quickly re- established his reputation as a \\"classic trades-union rightist\\" within the Labour Party. He was a firm Atlanticist and a stalwart defender of the constitutional monarchy, but was also in favour of the nationalisation of Britain's ports. He served as Shirley Williams' PPS and as an indirectly elected member of the European Parliament from 1975‚Äì1979. After the 1979 election, Mitchell felt increasingly uneasy with the leftward drift of the Labour Party. However, he was rooted in the Labour movement and was loath to leave the party that he been a member of for nearly four decades. This deep sense of connection contributed to his initial reluctance to leave the Labour Party but, by May 1981, he had formally announced that he did not plan to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Southampton Itchen. However, not until after the Labour conference in the autumn of 1981 did he formally leave Labour for the SDP. When he left, he cited as opposition to \\"further nationalisation, import controls and withdrawing Britain from the Common Market.\\" In the 1983 general election, Mitchell finished second with 16,647 votes, 5,290 votes behind the Conservative winner, Christopher Chope. Once out of parliament, Mitchell served as a lecturer in Business Studies at Eastleigh College of Further Education. He tried for selection as SDP candidate for the 1984 Portsmouth South by-election but lost out to Mike Hancock who went on to win the seat. He contested Southampton Itchen again in the 1987 election as the Liberal-SDP Alliance candidate, but finished third behind Chope and the Labour candidate, John Denham. Mitchell died in his native Southampton on 18 September 2003.  Family life  Bob Mitchell was married to Doreen Lilian Mitchell (Nee Gregory).

In 1882, Pasch published a book, Vorlesungen √ºber neuere Geometrie, calling for the grounding of Euclidean geometry in more precise primitive notions and axioms, and for greater care in the deductive methods employed to develop the subject. He drew attention to a number of heretofore unnoted tacit assumptions in Euclid's Elements. He then argued that mathematical reasoning should not invoke the physical interpretation of the primitive terms, but should instead rely solely on formal manipulations justified by axioms. This book is the point of departure for: *Similarly concerned Italians: Peano, Mario Pieri, Alessandro Padoa *Hilbert's work on geometry and mathematical axiomatics in general; *All modern thinking about the foundations of Euclidean geometry.

Original in the Elizabeth Bishop Perkins House Museum, York, Maine Colonel Simeon Perkins (February 24, 1735 ‚Äì May 9, 1812) was a Nova Scotia militia leader, merchant, diarist and politician. Perkins led the defence of Liverpool from attacks during the American Revolution, French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. In the 1770s, Liverpool was the second-largest settlement in Nova Scotia, next to Halifax. He also funded privateer ships in defence of the colony. He wrote a diary for 46 years (1766‚Äì1812), which is an essential historic document of this time period in Nova Scotian history. His home is now the Perkins House Museum. He was the grandfather of Joshua Newton Perkins. Joshua Newton Perkins has a portrait in Slater Hall, Norwich Free Academy in Norwich. So does his father, Simeon's son, Captain John Perkins.  Military career  He was lieutenant-colonel of the county militia from 1772 to 1793, he served as colonel commandant from 1793 to 1807. During the American Revolution, he defended the town numerous times from attack by American privateers. There were five raids on the town: October 1776, March 1777, September 1777, May 1778, and September 1780. He also went on the offensive by funding various privateer ships of his own to attack American privateers. A month after HMS Blonde defeated Duc de Choiseul, on May 1, 1778, American privateers raided Liverpool, ravaging and pillaging a number of the houses and stores, including the store of Simeon Perkins. Three weeks later, on May 21, the same privateers returned and tried to tow the wreck of Duc de Choiseul out to sea. Perkins mustered ten men at the shore. Cannon fire was exchanged by the British militia and the American privateers. The privateers continued to fire at the town for almost an hour. Perkins marched his men along the shore, closer to the privateers. One of the militia was wounded in the ensuing exchanges. The privateers stayed off shore for a number of days. Perkins kept a sergeant and six men on guard duty twenty four hours a day until the privateers left the area.Simeon Perkins' Diary entries. Also see http://www.mersey.ca/choiseul.html After suffering three years of similar sporadic raids, Perkins, on June 2, 1779, built a battery for the artillery and on October 31 launched their own privateer vessel named Lucy to bring battle to their adversaries.Brebner. Neutral Yankees. pp. 334‚Äì335 As well, Perkins wrote a successful appeal to the authorities in Halifax, and on December 13, 1778 Captain John Howard's company of the King's Orange Rangers arrived aboard the transport Hannah. The company consisted of Howard, 2 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 3 sergeants, 2 or 3 corporals, 48 privates, and several camp followers, both women and children.\\"King's Orange Rangers\\", John G. Leefe, Liverpool 1996, p 14 The most dramatic defense of Liverpool occurred on September 13, 1780.

Liverpool was not bothered by privateers for the remainder of the war. Perkins also invested in privateering during the Napoleonic Wars, earning substantial returns from vessels such as the ships , Duke of Kent and the famous brig RoverConlin, Daniel. \\"A Private War in the Caribbean: Nova Scotian Privateering 1793‚Äì1805, The Northern Mariner, Vol. VI, No. 4, pp. 29‚Äì48.  Politician  A born leader, he held public office for a long period representing Queens County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1765 to 1768 and from 1770 to 1799. He held twenty-seven government positions in his lifetime, none of which paid, including justice of the peace, colonel of the militia, and judge in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Quarter Sessions.  Family  Perkins was born in Norwich, Connecticut, one of sixteen children of Jacob Perkins and Jemima Leonard. He came to Liverpool, Nova Scotia, in May 1762 as part of the New England Planter migration to Nova Scotia.Converse, Charles Allen (1905). Some of the Ancestors and Descendants of Samuel Converse, Jr., Vol. II, pp. 833‚Äì34. Boston: Eben Putnam. In Liverpool, Perkins immediately began trading in fish and lumber and forged trading ties with New England, Newfoundland, Europe and the West Indies. He had nine children from two marriages. His first wife, Abigail Backus, died four weeks after the birth of his first son Roger. He married again in 1775 to Mrs. Elizabeth Headley (Young) who had been widowed two months before the birth of her daughter Ruth.  Diary  His diary, which he began in 1766, remains a vital source for historians studying the society and economy of colonial Canada and notably the battle for identity and loyalty during the American Revolution. Perkins was at first neutral, but became increasingly loyal to the British cause. After relentless American privateer attacks on shipping and an attempted American looting of Liverpool itself, Perkins helped lead the defences of the town and outfitted several privateer ships against the Americans.Horwood, Harold and Butts, Ed (1988).

One of his diary entries, for October 12, 1796 allegedly contains the first report of a UFO sighting in modern North America.Mark Kearney and Randy Ray, The Great Canadian Trivia Book, 1996, page 183 Perkins reports the tale circulating at the time of a young lady and two men living at New Minas, Nova Scotia on upper reaches of the Bay of Fundy, who, during a recent sunrise, saw as many as fifteen ‚Äúships in the air ... and a man forward with his hand stretched out.‚Äù Perkins continues, \\"the story did not obtain universal credit but some people believed it.\\" The original copies of Perkins diaries were donated to the Town of Liverpool in 1899 and are now held by the Queens County Museum in Liverpool. The diary was published in five volumes by the Champlain Society between 1948 and 1967. The diaries are now available online.

He was featured on the cover of TIME magazine on March 4, 1935. Biography Harrison's parents escaped slavery through the Underground Railroad. Harrison was born in London, Ontario, Canada, on September 28, 1864, the eldest of five siblings. His mother named him Richard after seeing a performance of Shakespeare's Richard III. Her interest in theatre placed Harrison on the way to becoming an actor. In his youth, he worked selling newspapers, and managed to work near a local theatre where he would try to get to know the actors. Whenever he saved enough money he would attend the plays. His talents were recognized early in recitations that he would give at school and in church. After moving to Detroit, he began his dramatic studies at the Detroit Training School of Dramatic Art, and privately with British drama coach Edward Weitzel, drama editor for the Detroit Free Press. From 1892 to 1896, Harrison traveled the U.S., performing as a dramatic reader. Harrison‚Äôs repertoire included works from Shakespeare and poetry from his friend Paul Laurence Dunbar, including promotional tours for Dunbar's book Oak and Ivy. He married Gertrude Janet Washington in 1895; she was the first Black person to graduate from the Chicago Conservatory of Music. They had two children, Lawrence Gilbert and Marian Ysobel. He also has descendent family members in Kansas City, Missouri and throughout the Kansas City metro area. Harrison became extremely well known after playing \\"de Lawd\\" in more than 1,650 performances of Marc Connelly‚Äôs play, The Green Pastures, which opened on Broadway on February 26, 1930. The show ran for 16 months, then went on tour, appearing in more than 203 cities and towns (including his hometown of London, Ontario, at the Grand Theatre), and later won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama for playwright Connelly in 1931. He taught elocution and dramatics courses at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, Branch Normal College (University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Arkansas), and Flipper-Key College in Oklahoma. Harrison died of heart failure in New York City, on March 14, 1935, ten days after he was featured on the cover of TIME magazine. Accolades *Received the NAACP‚Äôs 1931 Spingarn Medal for Distinguished Achievement. * On his 70th birthday in 1934, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Howard University and honorary doctorate degrees in Dramatic Literature from North Carolina Agriculture and Technical College and Lincoln University, and he became the first actor ever to be awarded the Sigma Society Key from Boston University. He had shaken the hands of mayors and received congratulatory telegrams from 14 university presidents and seven governors, was praised by many religious leaders for his performance and was awarded an inscribed Bible from the Clergy Club of New York City. *A public library in Raleigh, North Carolina, founded by Mollie Huston Lee, was named after Harrison in 1935. In today's Richard B. Harrison Library is also the Richard B. Harrison Community Auditorium. *Richard B.

It is one of the oldest surviving universities in Spain, and the oldest in the Valencian Community, and is regarded as one of Spain's leading academic institutions. The University was founded in 1499, and currently has around 55,000 students. Most of the courses are given through the medium of Spanish, but the university has promised to increase the number of courses available in Valencian. Moreover, in some degrees part of the teaching is in English. It is located in the Mediterranean Spanish baseline, in the city of Valencia which is the capital and most populous city of the autonomous community of Valencia and the third largest city in Spain, with a population of 829,705 in 2014. One of its campuses is located in the metropolitan area of Valencia, in the municipalities of Burjassot and Paterna. There are three campuses: *The Burjassot Campus houses the colleges of Biology, Pharmacy, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and the School of Engineering. *On the Avenida de Blasco Iba√±ez Campus the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Philosophy and Educational Sciences, Psychology, Geography and History, Languages, Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Nursing. *The third campus, Tarongers, houses the Schools of Law, Economics and Business, Social Sciences, and recently the School of Elementary Teacher Training, which moved from its previous location near the Blasco Iba√±ez Campus. The current chancellor is Esteban Morcillo S√°nchez. History At the request of James I the Conqueror, Pope Innocent IV in 1246 authorized (by a Bull) the establishment of estudis generals in Valencia. The University Statutes were passed by the municipal magistrates of Valencia on April 30, 1499; this is considered to be the 'founding' of the University. In 1501, Pope Alexander VI signed the bill of approval and one year later Ferdinand II the Catholic proclaimed the Royal Mandatory Concession. Its foundation was due to the zeal of St. Vincent Ferrer and to the donation of a building by Mosen Pedro Vilaragut. Only very meagre accounts have been preserved of the practical workings of the university. From the time of its foundation the courses included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, philosophy, mathematics, and physics, theology, Canon law, and medicine. Historic claustre of la Nau building The closing years of the seventeenth, and the whole of the eighteenth century, witnessed the most prosperous era of the university, Greek, Latin, mathematics, and medicine being specially cultivated. Among the names of illustrious students that of Tosca, Evangelista Torricelli's friend, noted physicist and author of important mathematical works, stands out prominently. Escolano says that it was the leading university in mathematics, the humanities, philosophy, and medicine. Large anatomical drawings were made by the students. Valencia was the first university of Spain to found a course for the study of herbs. Many of the Valencian graduates of medicine became famous. Pedro Ximeno discovered the third small bone of the ear. He was professor at Alcal√° and had for a pupil the celebrated Vall√©s. Luis Collado, professor of botany, made some valuable discoveries and carried on exhaustive studies of the plants of the Levant; Vicente Alonzo Lorente wrote works on botany; and the famous botanist Cavanilles was also a student of this university. In the seventeenth century the university divided into two factions, the Thomists and the anti-Thomists. The discussions were heated and aroused partisan feelings throughout the entire Kingdom of Valencia. The university possessed a library of 27,000 volumes which was destroyed by the soldiers under the command of General Suchet. Among the most noted professors of the university was D. Francisco P√©rez Bayer, a man of wide culture and great influence in the reign of Charles III of Spain. Around the university several colleges for poor students sprang up: the first was founded by St. Thomas of Villanova in 1561 and then followed those founded by Do√±a Angela Alonsar, and Mosen Pedro Mart√≠n. The most famous, called Corpus Christi, was founded by Blessed Juan de Ribera; Philip II founded that of San Jorge; and Melchor de Villena founded the last in 1643. During the Spanish Civil War, in 1938, a fire badly damaged the library.LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY () Nowadays it is a modern European public university open to almost every branch of teaching, research and learning in humanities, basic sciences and technology, health sciences, social sciences, and education.  Campuses  The University of Valencia has three main urban campuses located in Valencia city and in Burjassot-Paterna, and some other buildings and facilities in the hearth of Valencia town, such as the Historic Building, Botanical Garden, Cerver√≥ Palace, the Rectorate and others. The University of Valencia's Rectorate Schools and Faculties The University of Valencia has 18 Schools and Faculties located in its three main campuses. Each one allocates different academic departments and offers undergraduate, official masters and PhD programs. Studying at the University of Valencia The University of Valencia offers degrees in almost all of the academic fields: arts and humanities, engineering, health sciences, sciences, and social sciences. The exchange programs with foreign universities, as well as other programs of International Cooperation and Development Aid, allow students to study in other academic institutions from Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. Regarding student mobility through Erasmus program, it is among the top ten universities in Europe. The university has partnered with International Studies Abroad, a study abroad provider based in Austin, Texas, to bring inbound students from the United States and Canada. Research Research is conducted through several ways. The Academic Departments within each School, the Research Institutes, the Science Park and some others. The Research Institutes are conceived as multi-disciplinary research structures beyond the framework of the departments; they aim to meet the demand of the economic and social context in the research and transfer fields.

Life Lou Gui was from Nanyang Commandery (ÂçóÈôΩÈÉ°), which is around present- day Nanyang, Henan. In his younger days, he was arrested and sentenced to death for providing shelter to fugitives, but he managed to break out of prison, disguise himself to fool the guards and successfully escape. In the early 190s, he gathered a group of followers and brought them along to join Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. During his brief stay in Jing Province, he helped Liu Biao recruit many members of the scholar-gentry who had fled south to Jing Province to evade the chaos in central and northern China. Around the time, he encountered Wang Zhong, who had fled to Jing Province to avoid a famine in the Guanzhong region. When Lou Gui tried to recruit Wang Zhong to join Liu Biao, Wang Zhong attacked him, induced his followers to defect to his side, and brought them along to join the warlord Cao Cao. Lou Gui later left Liu Biao and joined Cao Cao as well. Cao Cao treated him respectfully and commissioned him as an army general. However, Lou Gui never held command of any troops and instead served as a military adviser. In 208, when Cao Cao led his forces to attack Jing Province, the provincial governor Liu Cong (Liu Biao's son) surrendered and offered his fu (a tally symbolising authority) to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao's other advisers suspected that Liu Cong was pretending to surrender, Lou Gui argued that Liu Cong was sincere since he had given up his fu, and managed to convince Cao Cao to accept Liu Cong's surrender. In 211, during the Battle of Tong Pass, Lou Gui advised Cao Cao to order his troops to mix water and sand and use the mixture to build defensive walls and structures. As the weather was freezing, the water-and-sand mixture froze overnight and became an instantly-built fortress for Cao Cao's forces. Over the years, Lou Gui and his family managed to amass a huge fortune. Cao Cao once remarked, \\"Lou Zibo may be wealthier than me, but he doesn't have as much power as me.\\" One day, while he was with Xi Shou (ÁøíÊéà), Lou Gui saw Cao Cao and his son(s) out on a trip. Xi Shou remarked, \\"Both father and son(s) look really happy.\\" Lou Gui remarked, \\"When you live in this world, you should strive to be self-reliant. Why should you keep looking at other people?\\" Xi Shou later secretly reported to Cao Cao what Lou Gui said. Cao Cao, thinking that Lou Gui was showing disrespect towards him, then ordered him to be executed. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Lou Gui appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In the novel, he is a hermit from Jingzhao Commandery (‰∫¨ÂÖÜÈÉ°; around present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi) living in the Zhongnan Mountains. His nickname was \\"Mengmei Householder\\" (Â§¢Ê¢ÖÂ±ÖÂ£´). He appears during the Battle of Tong Pass to assist Cao Cao. After Cao Cao wins the battle, he wants to thank Lou Gui by rewarding him, but Lou Gui declines and leaves.

Geological Magazine, decade 4 5:1-6 Discovery and naming Close up of the tooth seen from three different angles In 1894, W. A. Sanford described the fossil remains of what he considered to be two large reptiles discovered near Westbury-on-Severn, Glastonbury (Westbury Formation) by Eev. Sydenham H. A. Hervey and Sanford himself.Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological Society - vol. xl, 1894, p. 234 Harry Govier Seeley described the fossils and named two genera: Avalonia (preoccupied; now Avalonianus) and Picrodon; both are based solely on teeth. A second species, P. solus, was supposedly named by Carole J. Burrow in 2012, based on Early Jurassic (Hettangian) remains. It was classified as a basal sauropod, sharing some similarities with prosauropods. Its fossils were quarried in 1884 in Manchester, Connecticut. It has since been found to have been the same animal as the dinosaur Anchisaurus solus, which is now a synonym of Anchisaurus polyzelus. Only a single tooth, holotype BMNH R2875, belonging to P. herveyi is known, making the remains not sufficient enough to make judgments on its diet or its classification; although it is agreed that Picrodon was an archosaur to some degree. Classification Sanford (1894) classified Picrodon as a reptile, while Seeley (1898) classified Picrodon as a saurian. More modern research however almost certainly places Picrodon within Archosauria; Peter Malcolm Galton (1985) suggested that Picrodon may have been a basal sauropodomorph. Currently, its exact phylogenetic placement within Archosauria remains unknown.

Gaye Holud in 250px 250px It is part of an elaborate series of celebrations constituting the Bengali wedding. The gaye holud takes place one or two days prior to the religious and legal Bengali wedding ceremonies. The gaye holud may be a joint event for the bride and groom's families, or it may consist of separate events for the bride's family and the groom's family. Separate events are held for the bride's gaye holud, the groom's family - minus the groom himself - go in procession to the bride's home. They carry with them the bride's wedding outfit and jewelry, wedding decorations such as the turmeric paste ( holud) and henna ( mehedi/mehendi), cosmetics, sweets and other gifts. They may also bring fresh fish dressed as a wedding couple, or desserts molded to resemble fish. The procession traditionally centers on the bride's (younger) female relatives and friends, who traditionally dress in matching clothes. The bride, her attendees, and all the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, orange, or green clothing. Nowadays, other colours may be permitted for gaye holud guests. The guests then enjoy a feast, including music, dance and some performances, arranged by the bride's family. 250px The bride is seated on a dais, and the henna is used to decorate her hands and feet with elaborate abstract designs. The turmeric paste is applied by the guests to her face and body. Turmeric is known to cleanse, soften and brighten the skin, giving the bride's skin the distinctive yellow hue that gives its name to this ceremony. The sweets are then fed to the bride by all the guests and attendants, piece by piece. The groom's gaye holud comes next, and has the same form as the bride's holud ceremony. In this ceremony, the bride does not participate. The groom is accompanied by his younger male relatives and friends, and as with the bride's ceremony, the guests traditionally wear red, yellow, green, or orange clothing. The bride's family brings the gifts for the groom (usually the wedding outfit and some grooming items, along with the turmeric and other gifts) to his house. The guests exchange sweets with and apply turmeric paste to the groom, and a feast (with food, music, dance, and various cultural performances) is arranged for the guests from the groom's family. Unlike the bride, the groom does not get henna applied to his body; henna is only applied to the bride and perhaps also some of her younger female attendants. Although similar ceremonies exist in other parts of the Indian subcontinent, the gaye holud is a custom particular to the Bengali people. It is not considered a religious function, as it is celebrated by Muslims,Hindus, and Christians in both Bangladesh and Indian state of West Bengal. Although it is considered a part of the Bengali wedding tradition, the couple is not considered married at the end of the gaye holud. There is no legal marriage performed during this ceremony. Unlike the wedding ceremonies, the gaye holud is not a formal or extravagant event; both guests and bridal party members dress more simply and decorate the venue less intricately than at the wedding ceremonies.

He has developed a theory that the system of Gulf Stream and Arctic ice cap serve as a thermostatic control system, for preventing the planet from heating above a certain temperature, approximately the current global temperature. The Arctic sea ice is an essential part of that control system, and it threatens to disappear (at end summer) possibly as soon as 2012 but likely by 2030 or 2040, thus disabling the thermostatic control of the planet, and allowing massive methane discharge from permafrost and disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet.John Nissen: It may already be too late to deal with this terrifying leak.

Early life Amfitheatrof was born in Saint Petersburg into a family that was distinguished in various areas of the arts and culture. His father Aleksander Amfiteatrov was a noted writer. His mother Illaria (n√©e Sokoloff), an accomplished singer and pianist, had studied privately with Rimsky-Korsakov. His brother Maksim (Massimo) was an internationally renowned cellist, called the \\"Cellists' Caruso\\", who worked with Arturo Toscanini and Fabrizio De Andr√©. Daniele's early life was one of extreme hardship. In January 1902, at the age of three months, he was removed to Siberia, where his father was imprisoned for publishing anti-Tsarist articles. In 1904 the authorities returned the family to St. Petersburg, after which time they emigrated to Italy. At the age of six, Daniele commenced private music studies with his mother. In 1914, he was accepted as a student by Ottorino Respighi in Rome. Shortly thereafter, however, the family returned to Russia, where Alexander Amfitheatrof was appointed as political advisor to Alexander Kerensky during the few months that he was prime minister before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. In spite of the political and social upheavals of the time, young Daniele received formal instruction in harmony under Nikolai Shcherbachov and JƒÅzeps Vƒ´tols at the Petrograd Conservatory between 1916 and 1918. In 1921, he was permitted to travel to Prague, Czechoslovakia for further study in counterpoint under Jaroslav K≈ôiƒçka. After four years of ongoing hardships, the Amfitheatrof family escaped from Soviet Russia. Their perilous crossing through the Gulf of Finland was made in the dead of night. The family returned to Italy in the spring of 1922. Daniele became a naturalised Italian citizen and resumed his formal music training under Respighi. He received his diploma in composition from the Royal Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in Rome in 1924. Composer and conductor Following his graduation, Amfitheatrof took his place in Italian music circles of the day. In 1924 he was appointed pianist, organist, and assistant choral conductor of the Augusteo Symphony of Rome. Successive appointments included a position as the artistic director of the Italian Radio in Genoa and Trieste (1929‚Äì1932), as well as the management of RAI in Turin, where he also conducted many symphony concerts, choral works and operas at the Teatro Regio di Torino (1932‚Äì1937). He also traveled extensively throughout Europe, conducting many of the leading orchestras there. Amfitheatrof's success as a composer in his own right was assured early on in his professional career by performances of his concert works, including Poema del mare (1925), Miracolo della rosa (1926) and Christmas Rhapsody for Organ and Orchestra (1928) and American Panorama (1933). Later, he composed his first film score for Max Oph√ºls' La Signora di tutti (1934). Arrival in the United States of America Following the premiere of his programmatic work American Panorama (1935), which was conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos in Turin in 1937, Amfitheatrof was invited by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra to a position as Mitropoulos's associate for the first two months of the 1937-1938 concert season. Amfitheatrof arrived in the United States with his wife (n√©e May C Semenza), his son, Erik (b. 1931), and daughter, Stella Renata (b. 1934), at New York Harbour on October 21, 1937. His arrival was noted in the New York papers. Amfitheatrof's busy schedule with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra included concerts in regional Minnesota and the province of Manitoba. His appearances were well liked by audiences and received much favourable press. Amfitheatrof also accepted a brief engagement with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the behest of their conductor, Serge Koussevitsky, in 1938. Hollywood With World War II imminent in Europe, Amfitheatrof elected to remain in the United States. He relocated his family to California on the recommendation of Boris Morros, then director of music at Paramount Pictures. Amfitheatrof was hired by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer Studios under an exclusive four-year contract (1939‚Äì1943). His scores at MGM include those for Lassie Come Home, the first major film of a young Elizabeth Taylor. During his twenty-six years in Hollywood, where he was employed by each of the major studios at one time for another, he composed the scores (often uncredited) for over 50 films, including Letter from an Unknown Woman, The Desert Fox, The Naked Jungle, The Last Hunt, and The Mountain. His final score was written for Major Dundee in 1965. (This score, which was disliked by many, including director Sam Peckinpah, was replaced with a new score by Christopher Caliendo for the reconstructed version, which was released theatrically in 2005; both scores can be heard on the DVD, released later that year). Amfitheatrof was twice nominated for an Oscar for his work on Guest Wife and Song of the South. Amfitheatrof once remarked in written correspondence (citation: private letters) with his friend and colleague, John Steven Lasher, that his career in Hollywood \\"as a prostitute composer\\" ultimately tarnished his image as a professional musician. As a result, he was unable to secure commissions or performances of his concert works. Final years Amfitheatrof returned to Italy in 1959 and lived there for the most part until 1967. He made frequent visits to the United States during the final 15 years of his life. Plans to secure funding for a stage musical called The Staring Match, the production of a film, and the completion of a cello concerto, were all doomed to failure. His final years were spent in relative seclusion in Venice and in Rome, where he died on June 4, 1983.

Most literary references are found in Icelandic and Old English literature like the H√°vam√°l, where the term Fimbul√æulr, \\"the great thyle\\", presumably refers to Odin himself,H√°vam√°l, ed. David A. H. Evans, Viking Society for Northern Research Text Series, London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 1986, , verse 80 and note, p. 114. and Beowulf. In Gautreks saga, Starkad is referred to as a √æulr after he sacrifices a king.Michael J. Enright, \\"The Warband Context of the Unferth Episode\\", Speculum 73.2 (1998) 297‚Äì337, , . The word also appears on the runic inscription of the Snoldelev Stone.\\"Snoldelev- sten\\" at Danske Runeindskrifter, National Museum of Denmark, retrieved September 21, 2017 . Frederiksberg's original name was Tuleh√∏j (\\"Thyle Hill\\"). The Old English term is glossed as Latin histrio \\"orator\\" and curra \\"jester\\"; √æylcr√¶ft means \\"elocution\\". Zo√´ga's Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic defines √æulr as \\"wise-man, sage,\\" cognate to Old Norse √æula (verb) \\"to speak\\" and √æula (noun) \\"list in poetic form\\". The Rundata project translates √æulr as \\"reciter\\". From this it appears that the office of thyle was connected to the keeping and reproducing of orally transmitted lore like the R√≠gs√æula, \\"Lay of R√≠gr\\". Unfer√∞ holds the role of thyle in the poem Beowulf; it has been suggested that he was also the scop who is mentioned reciting poetry at the feast.Norman E. Eliason, \\"The √ûyle and Scop in Beowulf\\", Speculum 38.2 (1963) 267‚Äì84, , . It might be seen as a legitimate function of a guardian of the knowledge of the past to challenge boasts, judging them against the heroic past.Paul C. Bauschatz, The Well and the Tree: World and Times in Early Germanic Culture, Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1982, , note 22, pp. 215‚Äì16. This may have played a role in preserving the luck of the group. Alternatively the thyle's role, including Unferth's, has also been envisaged as part of the comitatus (war-band), channeling rage into concerted action. Some modern scholars view the role of the thyle as being usurped by monks after Christianization, and being reduced to the modern caricature of the jester (hence the Latin gloss of curra).

Hyperbolic Dehn surgery exists only in dimension three and is one which distinguishes hyperbolic geometry in three dimensions from other dimensions. Such an operation is often also called hyperbolic Dehn filling, as Dehn surgery proper refers to a \\"drill and fill\\" operation on a link which consists of drilling out a neighborhood of the link and then filling back in with solid tori. Hyperbolic Dehn surgery actually only involves \\"filling\\". We will generally assume that a hyperbolic 3-manifold is complete. Suppose M is a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold with n cusps. M can be thought of, topologically, as the interior of a compact manifold with toral boundary. Suppose we have chosen a meridian and longitude for each boundary torus, i.e. simple closed curves that are generators for the fundamental group of the torus. Let M(u_1, u_2, \\\\dots, u_n) denote the manifold obtained from M by filling in the i-th boundary torus with a solid torus using the slope u_i = p_i/q_i where each pair p_i and q_i are coprime integers. We allow a u_i to be \\\\infty which means we do not fill in that cusp, i.e. do the \\"empty\\" Dehn filling. So M = M(\\\\infty, \\\\dots, \\\\infty). We equip the space H of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds with the geometric topology. Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem states: M(u_1, u_2, \\\\dots, u_n) is hyperbolic as long as a finite set of exceptional slopes E_i is avoided for the i-th cusp for each i. In addition, M(u_1, u_2, \\\\dots, u_n) converges to M in H as all p_i^2+q_i^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty for all p_i/q_i corresponding to non-empty Dehn fillings u_i. This theorem is due to William Thurston and fundamental to the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It shows that nontrivial limits exist in H. Troels Jorgensen's study of the geometric topology further shows that all nontrivial limits arise by Dehn filling as in the theorem. Another important result by Thurston is that volume decreases under hyperbolic Dehn filling. In fact, the theorem states that volume decreases under topological Dehn filling, assuming of course that the Dehn-filled manifold is hyperbolic. The proof relies on basic properties of the Gromov norm. J√∏rgensen also showed that the volume function on this space is a continuous, proper function. Thus by the previous results, nontrivial limits in H are taken to nontrivial limits in the set of volumes. In fact, one can further conclude, as did Thurston, that the set of volumes of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds has ordinal type \\\\omega^\\\\omega. This result is known as the Thurston-J√∏rgensen theorem. Further work characterizing this set was done by Gromov. The figure-eight knot and the (-2, 3, 7) pretzel knot are the only two knots whose complements are known to have more than 6 exceptional surgeries; they have 10 and 7, respectively. Cameron Gordon conjectured that 10 is the largest possible number of exceptional surgeries of any hyperbolic knot complement. This was proved by Marc Lackenby and Rob Meyerhoff, who show that the number of exceptional slopes is 10 for any compact orientable 3-manifold with boundary a torus and interior finite-volume hyperbolic. Their proof relies on the proof of the geometrization conjecture originated by Grigori Perelman and on computer assistance. However, it is not currently known whether the figure-eight knot is the only one that achieves the bound of 10. A well-known conjecture is that the bound (except for the two knots mentioned) is 6. Agol has shown that there are only finitely many cases in which the number of exceptional slopes is 9 or 10. References *Ian Agol, Bounds on exceptional Dehn filling II, Geom.

Retrieved on December 14, 2009. Stage Stores operated 782 department stores in 42 states, almost all of which were eventually converted to their flagship brand, Gordmans, which it acquired in 2017. Historically, Stage Stores operated full-price retail outlets under the Bealls, Palais Royal, Peebles, Stage, and Goody's nameplates before transitioning away from that business model and toward an off-price positioning in 2019 and 2020. On May 11, 2020, Stage Stores announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing to find a buyer for the chain. The company had suffered poor sales in the 2019 holiday season, and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing retail shutdowns that began in March 2020, Stage Stores was unable to secure financing that would allow the continued operation of the chain. The company said that it would begin inventory liquidation sales at stores as soon as they could reopen. Exclusive brands of the company include Valerie Stevens, Signature Studio, Sun River, Rustic Blue, Rebecca Malone, and Wishful Park.

(department store) *Gordmans: Midwestern-based (off- price department store) *Goody's: Southeastern-based (department store) History Through a series of acquisitions the company grew to 793 stores as of July 29, 2017. In June 1992, Stage Stores, then known as Specialty Retailers, Inc. (SRI), acquired Colorado-based Fashion Bar, Inc., a family- owned business with 71 stores, most of which were comparable to Palais Royal and Bealls. The remainder were small specialty stores known as Stage Stores, which had already become part of SRI's operation. In 1996, SRI completed the closure of the other Fashion Bar Stores but retained the Stage name. The company purchased the forty-nine stores of Beall-Ladymon, Inc., sold by company president Horace Ladymon. The outlets were located in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; they were reopened in 1994 under the \\"Stage\\" name. Stage expanded into the Northwest with the acquisition in 1997 of C. R. Anthony Co. and Tri-North stores. The company acquired Uhlmans in 1997, which brought Stage to Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. All of these newly acquired stores, however, were closed by 1999 when Stage Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Closures as part of the bankruptcy included most of the former Fashion Bar, Milliken's, Tri-North, and Uhlman's stores, as well as an exodus from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. In 2003, Stage Stores acquired 136 Peebles stores located in 17 states. The company purchased the Goody's name through the Goody's bankruptcy auction in 2009. The nameplate was used in markets with a strong customer awareness and brand recognition of the name. In 2011, Stage Stores began a new chain called Steele's, but in March 2014 it was announced that these stores are being sold to Hilco Global. Stage Stores acquired the Gordmans' assets in March 2017 after becoming the winning bidder in a bankruptcy sale. The company announced that it planned to run at least 50 stores and one of Gordmans‚Äô distribution centers. Under the direction of Stage Stores, Gordmans began to transition away from the specialty department store business model, moving the brand to the off-price retail sector, more resembling stores like T.J. Maxx, Ross, and Burlington. As part of expanding the brand, Stage Stores opening their first new Gordmans store in Rosenberg, Texas in March, 2018. In March, 2019, Stage announced that by mid-2020 they planned to convert at least 220 of their current department stores, including those of other brand names, into Gordmans off-price stores. CEO Michael Glazer cited the high sales increases in the locations that were converted in 2018 as the deciding factor in the decision. In September, 2019, Stage Stores announced that they planned to completely exit the department store market, moving completely to the off-price model, converting all other stores brands to the Gordmans brand, and operating approximately 700 Gordmans stores by the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (August-October). In May 2020, Stage Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, even though the ongoing conversions had resulted in same-store sales rising more than 17% in the November-January fiscal quarter. Acquisitions Stage Stores, Inc. has acquired many stores over the years, including the following: *Fashion Bar (Colorado, Wyoming). Acquired in 1992, all stores converted to Stage. *Beall- Ladymon (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kansas). Acquired in 1994, all stores converted to Stage. *Uhlman's (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). Acquired in 1996. In addition to the Uhlman's name, Uhlman's operated Milliken's stores in Michigan. All were renamed Stage, except for locations in Traverse City, Michigan; Cadillac, Michigan;, and Manistee, Michigan which operated as Stage-Milliken until 2001.Stage/Milliken closing in next three months Archived, Traverse City Record-Eagle, January 4, 2001. *C. R. Anthony Co. (Montana, Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Wyoming) Acquired 1997, most stores converted to Stage, while some Anthony's, such as those located in Amarillo, Texas, became Bealls locations. *Tri-North (Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) Most of these locations operated as Hub Clothing Stores before the 1998 acquisition, when all 15 stores converted to Stage. *B. C. Moore & Sons, (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina). Acquired February 2006. By November 2006, 69 of these 76 stores were converted to the Peebles name and format, and the other nine were closed. Future and bankruptcy On September 17, 2019, Stage Stores announced plans to convert all remaining Stage, Bealls, Palais Royal, Peebles, and Goodys department store locations into Gordmans stores by the end of 2020. This would mean that Stage Stores would completely exit the department store market and instead go all in as an off-price retailer. By the end of fiscal year 2020, Stage planned to operate approximately 700 Gordmans Stores. CEO Michael Grazer cited the high sales increases in locations that had already been converted as the main factor in this decision. After the COVID-19 pandemic caused most of its stores to temporarily close, Stage Stores announced that it would enter bankruptcy proceedings and liquidate its inventory, except for individual stores for which it could find a buyer.

Domingo Nieto (15 August 1803 - 17 February 1844) was a Peruvian Grand Marshal, forefather of the nation, and politician who served as the 19th President of Peru between 1843 and 1844, officially as the President of the Government Junta and Grand Marshal of Peru. Nieto was born in Ilo - Moquegua in 1803, to a Spanish-Peruvian noble family bearing the title of \\"Counts of Alastaya\\", who were also of local noble blood directly descended from the Inca Huayna Capac by marriage of his daughter Catalina Sisa Occllo to the Conquistador Pedro Ladron de Guevara, who is a direct ascendant of the family. As an aristocratic youth, he quickly became disenchanted with Spanish rule and took the cause for Peruvian independence at the age of 18. Being one of the few nobles at the time that participated directly in the wars of independence, he is a unique member of the \\"forefathers of the nation\\" pantheon in Per√∫. During his military and political career he was called \\"the soldier/quixote of the law\\" for having a reputation of defending the constitution against all odds and siding with the rule of law, which clearly separated him from his peers. He is historically Peru's most remarkable military strategist and victorious figure, his military achievements made him a General by the age of 29 and Grand Marshal of Peru by the age of 39, something never repeated again in Peruvian history. He is also credited with participating and being victorious in the last recorded \\"personal combat\\" in the Battle of Tarqui, with the Venezuelan comandant Jos√© Mar√≠a Camacaro, assuming the challenge of deciding the fate of a battle in a single one-on-one combat. In his final years, he led, with Ram√≥n Castilla by his side, the overthrow of the \\"Supreme Dictator\\" Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco, assuming the presidency of Peru after being elected by the provisional Government Junta (provisional congress) charged with the re-establishment of constitutional order. He died soon after in office, on February 17, 1844. Castilla succeeded him by election of the Junta.  Legacy  * In 1936, under Law No 8230, the newly created Department of Moquequa had one of its provinces named after him. * Through Resolution N¬∫12177 passed by the Peruvian congress, in December 24, 1954, he was declared National Hero and his remains were translated from Moquegua to the Pantheon of Heros. * Through Supreme Resolution N¬∫31 IGE/IM of September 19, 1949 the presidential guard was renamed in his Honor: the Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment (\\"Regimiento de Caballer√≠a \\"Mariscal Domingo Nieto\\" Escolta del Presidente de la Rep√∫blica\\"). It was later disbanded in 1987 under order of President Alan Garcia Perez. However, as of 2012, the regiment was brought back into active service under Ministerial Resolution No139-2012/DE/EP signed by current incumbent president Ollanta Humala. In the years between, it served as an armored regiment. * A military academy of the Peruvian Army in the Province of Ilio, State of Moquegua was named after him.

He is currently chairman and Editor-in-Chief of The Day. He is a former editor of the Daily Express newspaper and a former novice Anglican monk. Addis was educated at West Downs School, Rugby School and Downing College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA and an MA. Between attending Rugby and Downing he spent two years as a novice at the Anglican priory of the Community of the Glorious Ascension in Watchet, Somerset. His started in journalism as deputy editor of Homes & Jobs magazine where he was rapidly promoted to editor and, to save money, wrote the entire magazine under various pseudonyms. It was there where he first demonstrated his flair for design when his insisted that his staff should all wear a different colour each day and sit next to each other so their clothes and the editorial floor were colour-coordinated. When the title went bankrupt he got a job as a reporter on Marketing Week where he remained for two years. His career took off when he was hired as a reporter on Londoner's Diary of the London Evening Standard in 1985. He went on to become Editor of Londoner's Diary and Assistant Editor (Features).

The building is one of only two surviving in London from the reign of Edward I, and dates from between 1250-1290. It is dedicated to √Üthelthryth, or Etheldreda, the Anglo-Saxon saint who founded the monastery at Ely in 673. It was the chapel of the London residence of the Bishops of Ely. In the early 17th century it served briefly as an embassy chapel for the Spanish Ambassador, and a haven for English Catholics. The chapel was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1874 and opened in 1878 and is one of the oldest churches in England to be in current use by the Catholic Church. Description Audio description of the church by Julie Etchingham St Etheldreda's consists of a chapel, or upper church, and a crypt or undercroft and is active and used for Masses, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Because Etheldreda was often invoked for help with infections of the throat, the Blessing of the Throats is held annually at the chapel. The Catholic chapel at the United States Military Academy, West Point, is modelled on St Etheldreda's. History=13th century St Etheldreda's was built some time between 1250 and 1290 as the town chapel for the Bishops of Ely.\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p45:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 It was part of Ely Palace or Ely House, their London residence. 14th century In 1302, John, Earl of Warenne, swore his loyalty to Edward II in the chapel. In 1381 John of Gaunt moved to the palace, after the Savoy Palace was destroyed during the Peasants' Revolt. 16th century In 1534, Catholic Masses were outlawed in England. The Bishops of Ely continued to oversee the chapel which was used for Anglican worship after the English Reformation. In 1576 a lease on a portion of the house and lands surrounding the chapel was granted by Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, to Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Elizabeth I. The rent was ¬£10, ten loads of hay and one red rose per year, a small enough sum to give rise to suspicion that Elizabeth had put pressure on the bishop. Hatton borrowed extensively from the crown to pay for refurbishment and upkeep of the property. During his tenancy, the crypt was used as a tavern. Ely Palace is mentioned in two of Shakespeare's plays, Richard II and Richard III. 17th century In 1620, the upper church was granted to Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, to use as a private chapel and considered to be on Spanish soil. Catholic worship, still illegal in England, was allowed in the church. Two years later, during a diplomatic dispute between England and Spain, Gondomar was recalled to Spain and use of the chapel was not given to his successor. Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely from 1638 (and uncle of Christopher Wren), worshipped at St Etheldreda's chapel before his imprisonment in 1641. In 1642, the palace and church was requisitioned by Parliament for use as a prison and hospital during the English Civil War. During Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth (1649‚Äì1660) most of the palace was demolished and the gardens were destroyed. 18th century Ely House (including St Etheldreda's chapel) In 1772, an Act of Parliament allowed the Bishops of Ely to sell the property to the Crown. The site, including the chapel, was sold on to Charles Cole, a surveyor and architect. He demolished all the buildings on the site apart from the chapel and built Ely Place. The chapel was extensively refurbished in the Georgian style before it re-opened in 1786. 19th century In 1820 the chapel was taken over by the National Society for the Education of the Poor who hoped to convert the Irish Catholic immigrants then settling in the area. A short time later the church closed. In 1836, Ely Chapel was reopened by the Reverend Alexander D'Arblay (son of Fanny Burney) as a place of Anglican worship but he died the following year. In 1843, the church was leased by Welsh Anglicans with services celebrated in the Welsh language. The chapel was put up for auction in 1874 and purchased for ¬£5,400 by the Catholic convert Father William Lockhart of the Rosminian order. Under Lockhart's direction, the crypt and upper church were restored by George Gilbert Scott to their original 13th- century designs. John Francis Bentley designed a choir screen incorporating a confessional, an organ and a choir gallery. The royal coat of arms, added during the reign of Charles I, was removed to the cloister. The church received a relic from the Duke of Norfolk: a piece of St Etheldreda's hand which is kept in a jewel cask to the right of the high altar. The restoration was completed in 1878 and a Catholic Mass was celebrated in St Ethelreda's for the first time in over 200 years. The upper church was reopened in 1879 on the Feast of St Etheldreda (23 June). For many years, St Etheldreda's church was the oldest Catholic church building in England, but since 1971 it has been surpassed by the 12th century church of Ss Leonard & Mary in Malton, North Yorkshire. 20th century The church as viewed toward the western stained glass window and entrance In 1925, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments scheduled the chapel as an ancient monument. In May 1941, during the Blitz, the church was hit by a bomb that tore a hole in the roof and destroyed the Victorian stained glass windows. It took seven years to repair the structural damage. In 1952, new stained glass by Joseph Nuttgens was installed in the east window. It features the Trinity, the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as well as the Virgin Mary, St Joseph, St Bridget of Kildare and St Etheldreda. The stained glass windows in the south wall depict scenes from the Old Testament, and the ones in the north wall show scenes from the New Testament. In the 1960s, two groups of four statues of English Catholic martyrs from the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I were installed along the north and south walls. They include St Edmund Gennings, St Swithun Wells, St Margaret Ward, Blessed John Forest, Blessed Edward Jones, Blessed John Roche, St Anne Line, and St John Houghton. 21st century In 2011, the Catholic Church proposed that St Anne's Church, Laxton Place, be used as the principal church of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. The journalist Damian Thompson, a prominent supporter of the ordinariate, called for St Etheldreda's to be used by the ordinariate, asserting that the church suffered a decline, both liturgically and as a parish community, in the early years of the 21st century. Father Kit Cunningham, for some 30 years the rector of St Etheldreda‚Äôs, was awarded the MBE in 1998. Cunningham returned the MBE before his death in 2010. It was subsequently revealed in June 2011 that Cunningham had sexually abused young boys at a school in Tanzania.

Car models of the brand were notable for their use of an electromagnetic transmission and were early examples of an electric series hybrid drivetrain. The manufacture of the car was sponsored by R.M. Owen & Company of New York, New York. The car was built in New York City in 1915, in Cleveland, Ohio, between 1916 and 1919 and finally in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1920 and 1921. While the cars were powered by a six- cylinder engine, power for the wheels was based upon the same electromagnetic principle that propelled the Battleship U.S.S. New Mexico. Automobile author Henry B. Lent described the drive mechanism thus: :The drive mechanism had no direct connection between the engine and the rear wheels. Instead of a flywheel, a generator and a horseshoe shaped magnet were attached to the rear of the engine's crank shaft. On the forward end of the car's drive shaft, was an electric motor with an armature fitted into an air space inside the whirling magnet. Electric current, transmitted by the engine's generator and magnet attached to the armature of the electrical motor, providing the energy to turn the drive shaft and propel the engine's rear wheels. Speed for the car was controlled by a small lever adjacent to the steering wheel. The first Owen Magnetic was introduced at the 1915 New York auto show when Justus B. Entz's electric transmission was fitted to the Owen automobile: \\"R.M. Owen have leased the large new three story fireproof building at the corner of Fifth avenue and One Hundred and Forty-second street, New York, where they will build the new Owen Magnetic motor cars.\\"Chicago Daily Tribune, January 26, 1915, Page 10. Walter C. Baker, of Cleveland, Ohio, owned the patents on the Entz transmission, thus each of the 250 Owen Magnetic automobiles produced in New York was built under license. The former Owen plant still exists and is presently a self-storage facility. The car became as famous as the company's clientele, which included Enrico Caruso and John McCormack. Owen Magnetics were advertised as \\"The Car of a Thousand Speeds\\". In December 1915, the company was moved to Cleveland when the R.M. Owen Company joined Walter Baker (of Baker Motor Vehicle) and the Rauch and Lang company. The Baker Electric Car company would produce the car, and Rauch and Lang would build the coachwork. Because of the combined resources, the 1916 Owen Magnetic increased its model range for 1916 model year, with prices in the $3,000 to $6,000 dollar range. Production continued through 1918, when Baker shifted its focus to war goods manufacturing. The company reorganized as the Owen Magnetic Motor Car Corporation based in Wilkes-Barre. The newly equipped factory was situated in the old Matheson works at Forty Fort, Pennsylvania.Wilkes-Barre Times, August 16, 1919, Page 1. The Wilkes-Barre Times announced the resumption of production for January 1, 1920, with the aim of producing 750 cars that year.Wilkes-Barre Times, October 23, 1919, Page 11. The company received an order for 500 vehicles from Crown Limited of Great Britain. Under the terms of the agreement, the cars were named Crown Magnetic. However, by August 1920, before the order could be fulfilled, Owen Magnetic was in receivership.Wilkes- Barre Times, August 30, 1920, Page 1; Wall Street Journal, September 2, 1920, Page 9. The Crown Magnetic was displayed at the London Motor Show in 1920.The Times of India, September 29, 1920, Page A11. According to some sources, the Woods Dual Power car manufactured by the Woods Motor Vehicle Company in Chicago also used the Entz transmission. That is not true. The Woods Dual Power had a drivetrain based on Roland Fend's U.S. patent number 1,303,870, not the inventions of Justus Entz. The Entz transmission had no physical connection between the gasoline engine and the driveshaft, while the Woods Dual Power had a clutch between the gas engine and the electric motor, allowing the engine to also drive the car through the armature shaft of the motor, which itself was connected to the driveshaft. The Woods car was similar in many ways to today‚Äôs hybrids. It used both a gasoline engine and an electric motor to propel the wheels, had regenerative braking to recharge the batteries and in some circumstances the car could charge the batteries while running on gasoline.

Prior to that, he was the athletic director at Northwestern University and Colgate University. He also played in the NFL as a safety for the NFL's Washington Redskins for eight seasons from 1977 to 1984. Early years and education Murphy was born in Fulton, New York. He attended Colgate University, where he was also a member of the Theta Chi fraternity and played college football. Before his NFL career ended and while playing for the Redskins he obtained an MBA from American University's Kogod School of Business in 1983. Murphy graduated with a J.D. degree from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1988. Professional career Murphy (middle) tackling an opponent in Super Bowl XVII Murphy played in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XVIII with the Washington Redskins. He played a key role in the Redskins 27‚Äì17 Super Bowl XVII win over the Miami Dolphins, recording a second half interception of Miami quarterback David Woodley's pass with the Dolphins on Washington's 37-yard line. Murphy's best season was in 1983, when he led the NFL with nine interceptions and returned them for 127 yards. He finished his eight-season career with 27 interceptions and 282 return yards, along with six fumble recoveries for 22 returns yards, in 109 games. He also made the Pro Bowl after the 1983 season. Murphy was the Redskins representative to the NFL Players Association. He served on the bargaining committee in the players' strike that caused the cancellation of seven games during the 1982 season. Many suspect that the Redskins' decision to release him after the 1983 season and the reluctance of any other team to sign him was retribution for his union activity. Sports executive Murphy moved back to Hamilton, New York, to become the athletic director at Colgate University in the early 1990s until 2003. Later, Murphy moved to Evanston, Illinois to serve as the athletic director at Northwestern University. On December 3, 2007, he was announced as the new Green Bay Packers President and CEO. On February 6, 2011, Green Bay won Super Bowl XLV, giving Murphy his second Super Bowl victory.

Population: . History It was founded in 1736 as Krasnoufimskaya fortress that would defend the Ural manufactures from the raids of nearby tribes; it was granted the status of chief town of uyezd in 1781. In the beginning of the 18th century, the majority of the residents were Cossacks, bourgeois, and merchants of the third guild. One of the main issues of the 19th century was the remoteness of Krasnoufimsk from the major cities of Perm and Yekaterinburg, and thus railroad. The town did not have any other transport links apart from unpaved roads and the river Ufa. Amongst its main economic activities at that time agriculture was considered one of the most valuable. The town's authorities strived to boost the development of industrial, agricultural, educational and medical sectors during the last quarter of 19th century by inviting some of the renowned specialists. On June 1, 1875, the first six-form real school was founded. Students could specialize either in mining or agricultural sciences. In 1915, a railway station was finally built in Krasnoufimsk, and in 1916, railroad service was launched. In 1930, Krasnoufimsk became the center of a large agricultural district. Significant investments in its infrastructure provided the town with a machine and tractor station, agriproducts processing plants, selective station, and other agriculture related enterprises. During World War II, some of factories and plants were evacuated from the western regions of the Soviet Union, which amongst others included: All-Union Institute of Plant Cultivation; Kharkov Institute of Mechanics and Machine- Building; Rostov and Ryazan factories. During the later half of the 20th century town's authorities carried on the development of comfortable housing, and agribusiness infrastructure. The coat of arms contain silver falcon with blue eyes sitting on a gold wavy belt on a green background was approved by the decision of the Krasnoufimsk City Council No. 5/5 dd. March 29, 2002. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of the administrative divisions, Krasnoufimsk serves as the administrative center of Krasnoufimsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated separately as the Town of Krasnoufimsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #30-OZ As a municipal division, the Town of Krasnoufimsk is incorporated as Krasnoufimsk Urban Okrug.Law #85-OZ Economy Economy of Krasnoufimsk is characterized by a well-balanced multi-sectoral structure. 80% of entities are private. Citizens are mainly employed in transport, communication, trade, catering and industry. Majority of output is split nearly equally between building materials production sector, woodworking industry, energy, machine-building and metal- working. Agriculture remains of great importance to the economy of the town. SMEs contribute significantly to the development of Krasnoufimsk employing 14% of economically active citizens and being the source of 7% of local budget revenues.

It protects the genetic material in their life-cycle when traveling between host cells. Not all viruses have envelopes. The envelopes are typically derived from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins), but include some viral glycoproteins. They may help viruses avoid the host immune system. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host. All enveloped viruses also have a capsid, another protein layer, between the envelope and the genome. The cell from which a virus buds often dies or is weakened, and sheds more viral particles for an extended period. The lipid bilayer envelope of these viruses is relatively sensitive to desiccation, heat, and detergents, therefore these viruses are easier to sterilize than non-enveloped viruses, have limited survival outside host environments, and typically must transfer directly from host to host. Enveloped viruses possess great adaptability and can change in a short time in order to evade the immune system. Enveloped viruses can cause persistent infections.

It was named by Gregory and Moore in 1931 for exposures in walls that form the Glen Canyon of the Colorado River in Coconino County, Arizona and San Juan County, Utah. An overview of the group was given three years before by Gilluly and Reeside. Baker revised the work and named the Kayenta Formation in 1936. The work was revised again in 1955 by Averitt and others. They assigned the Shurtz Sandstone Tongue (new) and Lamb Point Tongue (new) to the Navajo Sandstone, and Cedar City Tongue (new) and Tenney Canyon Tongue (new) to the Kayenta Formation. In 1957 Harshbarger and others created an overview and revision that assigned the Moenave Formation and divided the Wingate Sandstone into the newly named Rock Point and Lukachukai members. The group's age was modified by Lewis and others in 1961 and the upper contact was revised by Phoenix in 1963. Poole and Stewart attempted to reduce the group's rank to a formation they called the Glen Canyon Sandstone in 1964 (change not recognized by the USGS). Areal extent limits were revised by Wilson and Stewart in 1967 and again by Green in 1974. Peterson and Pipiringos revised the upper contact and created an overview in 1979. In 1989 the age of the group was modified by Padian and separately by Dubiel (who also revised the lower contact). Condon modified the areal extent limits in 1992.For the whole section, except where noted: GEOLEX database Bibliographic References Places found Alcove in the Navajo Sandstone near Moab, Utah.

The lyrics were written by the Russian-Ukrainian poet and writer Yevhen Hrebinka. The first publication of the poem was in Hrebinka's own Russian translation in Literaturnaya Gazeta on 17 January 1843. A song using these lyrics is attested already in the 1870s,https://rusneb.ru/catalog/000199_000009_003573957/viewer/?page=11 but its melody is not known. In The Book of World-famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk, published in 2000, the author, J. Fuld, mentions that a Soviet musicologist had reported to him that the song is not \\"a Russian traditional song but a cabaret song\\", published in a songs book by A. Gutheil in 1897 and mentioned, at p. 131, as a \\"Gypsy romance based on the melody of Florian Hermann's Valse Hommage.James J. Fuld. The book of world-famous music: classical, popular, and folk ‚Äì Courier Dover Publications, 2000. ‚Äì P. 417 (see also notes at p. 684). Despite the claim made by Fuld that, \\"Of the original melody author, Florian Hermann, not a single music score is known,\\" the sheet music for Hermann's piece and others of his works can be found. Here is his \\"R√™verie russe\\": The reason why there is not a single music score known is because Sindo Garay is the author of the original melody of Dark Eyes. In Rebeca Ch√°vez's 2010 documentary, 'Cuando Sindo Garay visit√≥ a Emiliano Blez', Garay explains in detail the origin of the song. The melody of 'Ojos negros que fascinan', a bolero, was composed upon request by Garay to a Russian choir girl with beautiful and expressive eyes when an Opera company from Russia came to visit Cuba in the early to mid-1890‚Äôs. Garay stated that the melody of 'Ojos negros' (Dark Eyes) went back to Russia with the musicians and it was not until many years later that he found out through a friend that the song was part of the soundtrack of a Russian film playing at the local theatre. Garay was pleased knowing his music was worthy of such a merit. The most renowned and played version of this song was written by Adalgiso Ferraris, and published, when still in Russia in 1910, with German editor Otto Kuhl, as \\"Schwarze Augen\\" (Black Eyes). Ferraris then published it again in 1931 by Paris Editions Salabert, as \\"Tes yeux noirs (impression russe)\\" and with Jacques Liber, on 9 October 1931. Ferraris, an Italian-born British composer, had spent many years in Russia before 1915. The song became one of his major successes in the 1920s and 1930s, being also played by Albert Sandler, by Leslie Jeffries in 1939, and sung by Al Bowlly in 1939 with words of Albert Mellor. Max Jaffa also recorded it. Ferraris himself can be seen in a British Path√© film from 1934 of Alfredo and his Gypsy band playing \\"Dark Eyes\\", sitting in the orchestra behind the lead Alfredo.

Formed by Australians living in the area, the club quickly grew with strong local interest, now attracting players from all over Berkshire. The club is sponsored by The Reading Walkabout. History The Reading Roos were formed for the 2003 British Australian Rules Football League season, playing in the newly formed BARFL Regional division. They played their first match against a selection from Oxford University at King's Meadow in Reading, and in the regular season, went on to make the grand final ‚Äì although they were defeated by the Bristol Dockers. The 2004 season saw the Roos win the grand final, thumping Bristol 28.20.188 to 1.6.12. The club also travelled to Aalborg in Denmark and won the Sheep Stations Cup against the North Copenhagen Barracudas. In 2005, the Roos competed in both the BARFL Premiership and the BARFL Regional competitions, though they failed to make the grand final in either league. In the BARFL Premiership despite committed performances, the guys could not match the greater experience of the London sides and finished 5th, though they did record a memorable victory against a dominant Wandsworth Demons team, the first side outside of the top 3 ever to do so. The club did repeat their victory in the Sheep Stations Cup, this time held in Copenhagen, Denmark, defeating the Farum Young Guns. In 2006, the club competed in the BARFL Regional division, again winning a grand final against the Nottingham Scorpions. The club also successfully defended the Sheep Stations Cup, held in Landskrona, Sweden, defeating the South Dublin Swans in an epic final. In 2007-8, the club played in the London Conference. With a struggle to match both the experience of the opposition and the available numbers, the club were unable to contest finals and only managed infrequent wins. In 2009, the club decided to drop down to the London social league, which includes Nottingham Scorpions and Manchester Mosquitos. Reading made it to the semi-finals for the first time in a London League, but unfortunately were defeated by old rivals Nottingham. They also hosted the Brit cup this year which is the EU only tournament, getting knocked out of the group stages, after two wins against Scotland and ARUK Central. In 2010 through 2017, the club continued in the London 3rds (or social) league and with the recruitment of some promising younger locals, began to develop into more of a competitive team, winning a majority of matches and contesting with their more experienced London peers. The team reached finals every year except 2017, winning the Grand Final in 2012 (vs Wimbledon Hawks) and 13 (vs Ealing Emus). These victories and the continuing social development were a clear indicator of the impact coach Travis White had made to the way the club played, trained and socialised, with growing numbers at club events and 2 flags, playing against teams with many more Australian players. International tour matches In early 2005, the Roos toured to Atlanta in the United States, defeating the home town Atlanta Kookaburras. In 2006 they competed in Perpignan against a French national selection, winning a tight match. In 2004, 5 and 6, the club took a squad to Denmark and Sweden to compete in the annual, 9-a-side Sheep Station Cup, winning and retaining the trophy through these 3 years. Player Development The Roos are lucky to count among their number several Australians who have played to a good standard in the Australian leagues. These experienced Aussies help bring through British talent quickly and have contributed greatly to the Roos counting several British Bulldog's squad members in their ranks. 2010 saw Adam Bennett and Gareth Blackstaffe-Turner selected for the first Team Europe, for their performances at the 2010 European Championships, held in Denmark and Sweden. Prior to the 2017 International Cup, Adam Bennett was the most capped Bulldog player and Andrew Whiteaker the top goal-scorer for the representative team. The Roos have attracted players from a wide variety of backgrounds, including soccer, rugby (union and league), basketball, athletics, martial arts, Gaelic Football and, of course, native Aussie Rules. Playing in the Social/3rd level of London competition provides the ideal platform to both introduce new players, as well as experience a realistic challenging playing environment.

Matrix numbers can refer to any of these elements, or all of them combined. The inscription area may also contain record plant codes or logos, the initials or signature of the disc cutting engineer, and cutting or copyright dates, among other things. The matrix number printed on the label should not be confused with the catalogue number, which is usually in larger type, and will typically be the same number on both sides of the record. Matrix numbers will be different on each side, and are sometimes printed upside down on the label to prevent them from being mistaken for the catalogue number. The purpose of the main number is to assign a filing number to the stamper, and to ensure each side receives the proper label, by visually comparing the number on the label to the inscribed number. The most important part of the extra information is usually the cut number, which is a suffix to the main number. For example, matrix number 12345 is seen on a label, but examination of the run-out groove area reveals number 12345‚Äì3, which indicates this is the third cut of this side. It is not unusual to find records with a different cut number on each side. Sides are recut for various reasons. Record stampers could only be used to make a limited number of copies before they became worn, and a new cut was required. As of the early 1980s, this was no longer true. Changes to master disc manufacturing methods, including the DMM or Direct Metal Mastering system, made it possible to make many copies of a master cut non-destructively, so a recut was no longer necessary when the plate used for pressing became worn. Stampers can also become damaged from handling. Recuts can also be made when there is a problem with the previous cut, for example, a technical fault or improper banding (the visual separation between songs). When a new cut is made, several copies called test pressings are made for technicians (and, for a new record, the producer and the recording artist) to review the cut, and determine if it should be accepted or rejected. If it is rejected, another cut must be made. More reasons for multiple cuts: If a record is pressed at more than one factory, as can be the case when a popular release is issued by a major record company with factories in more than one city, each factory may make its own master cut. If a record is issued internationally, each country typically cuts its own masters. If a record is re-issued by a different company, or by the same company under a different catalogue number, the record is usually recut, although there are occasions where the previous cut is reused and the new number is added to the inscriptions in the run-out area, sometimes with the previous number scratched out. Singles Records with one song per side, particularly 7-inch 45 rpm and 10-inch or 12-inch 78 rpm records, are often found with non-consecutive matrix numbers on each side, and the \\"hit\\" side or \\"side one\\" may not necessarily be the lower number. This indicates that the numbers were probably assigned at the time the songs were recorded. If there is a significant gap between the two numbers, the songs were probably not recorded at the same session. If the numbers appear to be from completely different sequences, or have a different format or number of digits, this can indicate that the numbers were assigned by the recording studio, and the two sides were recorded at different studios. When record historian Brian Rust researched his discography books on early recordings, he was able to determine the studio and approximate recording date of certain songs from matrix numbers by comparing them to other numbers in the sequence. 78 rpm records In the days of 78 rpm records, before recording tape was commonly used (up to approx. 1950), audio recordings were cut directly to disc. The recording studio would assign a number to the song to be recorded, which would become the main part of the matrix number, and several takes would be made, with the take number inscribed in the matrix area. Only one take would be selected for issue in most cases, but there are occasions where alternate takes were issued as well, possibly by accident. Frequently, the record label on an alternate take is identical to the label for the more common take, as it only shows the \\"main\\" matrix number for the song without the take number. Alternate takes are of interest to collectors, particularly if the music is jazz. Since jazz is often partially improvised, two takes can contain significant differences, and a comparison of two takes can reveal which portions of the music were pre- determined, and which were improvised or variable. Also, when two takes are released, one is usually much more common than the other, and the less common take can become a valuable record to collectors. Take numbers on Victor Records can usually be found to the left at the label, i.e. the \\"9 o'clock\\" position.Victor Mastering Numbering Systems at Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings website Victor's Use of Matrix Numbers at Gilbert and Sullivan Discography When looking for matrix information on 78 rpm records, care should be taken to examine the label area as well, as some numbers may be coded underneath the label, and are viewable as indentations. Albums Album matrix numbers are often similar to the catalogue number. For example, a record numbered X-1234 may have a matrix number like A‚Äì1234 or X‚Äì1234‚ÄìA on side one, and B‚Äì1234 or X‚Äì1234‚ÄìB on side two, as shown on the label. In the run-out area, the latter number could be expressed as X‚Äì1234‚ÄìB7, where 7 is the cut number. In other instances, the matrix numbers may be a separate series of two consecutive numbers such as 55667 and 55668. Compact discs Compact discs (CDs) also contain factory codes inscribed near the hub, and these are also called matrix numbers. Importance to collectors Matrix numbers are often quoted as evidence that a record is a \\"first pressing\\", although this term is not used in a consistent manner by collectors. Records can be pressed in multiple batches that are identical, and therefore a group of batches must be regarded as one \\"pressing\\". Collectors sometimes refer to a \\"second pressing\\" when a major change takes place, such as a change to the selection or order of songs on an album side, or a not-so-major change such as a different record label design, or correction of a typo on the label text, or minor variation of the cover, such as a change of address for the record company. Or they may refer to a record as a \\"second pressing\\" if the cut number changes, but the label, cover, and musical content are otherwise identical. A first cut could be a rejected cut, and a cut #2 or later could actually be the one used for the first pressing as issued to the public. Even so, collectible records are often questionably identified as \\"first pressing\\" based solely on the matrix number marked as cut #1. If a record is recut for re-issue with a new catalogue number, the cut number will probably start at #1 again. Therefore, a matrix number in itself is not proof of an original pressing, and additional research should be done before declaring a record to be a first pressing. A greater importance to collectors is where a recut contains an audible difference from previous cuts. Some recuts contain a different take, mix, or edit (length of song) from previous editions. Some recuts are made to re-issue a song with different lyrics as an act of censorship. Even if a censored record is only distributed to radio stations as a promo edition, there could be two versions of the promo: censored and uncensored. Some recuts with altered content have a suffix of \\"-RE\\" at the end of the inscribed matrix number, but this does not necessarily mean that the non-\\"RE\\" edition was issued to the public. In cases where a popular release is issued by a major label that uses more than one factory, so that copies are manufactured in several cities, a factory code in the form of a number, acronym, symbol, or logo found in the run-out area may have importance. These are sometimes quoted when collectible records are offered for sale. Factory codes used by major American labels such as Capitol, Warner Bros., RCA and Mercury have been documented by researchers. Hidden messages Record collectors have often been amused to find hidden messages inscribed in the run-out area. The vast majority of these are the work of George Peckham, a disc cutting engineer in the UK who possibly cut hundreds of thousands of records for many record companies over several decades from the 1960s onward, and often signed his cuts \\"Porky\\" or marked them as \\"A Porky Prime Cut\\". While some of his cuts state only his nickname or motto, others contain a clever or cryptic reference to something mentioned in the lyrics, or something about the recording artist. Some of his inscriptions include a small drawing or cartoon. Most of his cuts can be found on records manufactured in the UK, but his use of messages has been imitated by others, and similar messages can be found in records from various countries. They can even be found on compact discs on occasion. On the original UK edition of This Year's Model (1978), the second album by Elvis Costello, Peckham inscribed a message stating that this is the winning copy of a contest, and anyone finding this message should call the phone number which follows to claim their prize. The prize was a pre-printed signature photo of Elvis Costello which was sent out in limited numbers. U2's Rattle and Hum (1988) features a secret message to the band's production manager, Anne Louise Kelly, reading \\"We Love You A.L.K.\\", but this was the first of several hidden messages referring to her in U2 albums, followed by her name being scrambled to make the name Kiley Sue LaLonne in the booklet of Original Soundtracks 1 (1995) and then on most CD copies of Pop (1997), a message on the playing side of the CD near the matrix numbers reads \\"4UALKXXXX\\". Although hidden messages are usually the invention of the disc cutting engineer, there is an instance where a message is believed to have been inserted at the request of the recording artist, on Led Zeppelin's single, \\"Immigrant Song\\", which contains this message on copies made in more than one country: \\"Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law\\".Tim Neely, Goldmine Price Guide to 45 RPM Records, 2nd Edition, 1999, Krause Publications Not all copies contain this inscription, and copies that do have a higher collector's value. On Emitt Rhodes' self-titled album, an ornate design surround a \\"Recorded at Home\\" inscription, as Rhodes recorded the entire album by himself and at his home.

In a dramatic work, suspense is the anticipation of the outcome of a plot or of the solution to an uncertainty, puzzle, or mystery, particularly as it affects a character for whom one has sympathy. However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.  In drama  In literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest. It may be of several major types: in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of who, what, or how; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of when. Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about what will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don‚Äôt know how it will happen. Even in historical fiction, with characters whose life stories are well known, the why usually brings suspense to the novel. An adjunct to suspense is foreshadowing, as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in Isabel Allende‚Äôs House of the Spirits (1991).  Examples  * In Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (429 B.C.), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father. During the play, the spectators, aware that Oedipus will eventually make the discovery, share the hero's uncertainties and fears as he pursues the truth of his own past. * In George Washington Cable's story \\"Jean-ah Poquelin\\" (1875), the reader wants to know the cause of the strange smell and the unexplained disappearance of a brother. * In Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1895), the reader anticipates the outcome of the switching of a black infant with a white infant. * In Ernest J. Gaines's A Gathering of Old Men (1983), the reader waits for the court's decision at a murder trial.  Paradox of suspense  Some authors have tried to explain the \\"paradox of suspense\\", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves. Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible. The position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name rappel this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (suspense par contradiction).

When broken down into its Greek roots, it means \\"moderately-spined lizards\\". The family is split into two subgroups: Metriacanthosaurinae, which includes dinosaurs closely related to Metriacanthosaurus, and another group composed of the close relatives of Yangchuanosaurus. Metriacanthosaurids are considered carnosaurs, belonging to the Allosauroidea superfamily. The group includes species of large range in body size. Of their physical traits, most notable are their neural spines.Bailey, Jack Bowman. \\"Neural Spine Elongation in Dinosaurs: Sailbacks or Buffalo-Backs?\\" Journal of Paleontology, vol. 71, no. 06, 1997, pp. 1124‚Äì1146., doi:10.1017/s0022336000036076. Their fossils can be found mostly in the Northern hemisphere. Metriacanthosauridae is used as a senior synonym of Sinraptoridae.  Diagnostic traits  Life restoration of Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis Metriacanthosaurids share the following unambiguous synapomorphies among allosauroids: * A short or absent anterior ramus of the maxilla (also found in carcharodontosaurids and piatnitzkysaurids). * The laterosphenoid articulated on the frontal and postorbital. * A squamosal without constriction of the lower temporal fenestra. (also found in megalosauroids) * A flange on the squamosal covering the quadrate head laterally. * A well-defined longitudinal groove on the lateral side of the dentary housing a row of neurovascular foramina. * Broad, well developed spinopost-zygapophyseal lamina on the axis. * A manus shorter than the forearm. * Subrectangular and sheet-like neural spines of middle caudal vertebrae. * A manus without digit V or the phalanges of digit IV (also found in neovenatorids). * A heart-shaped cross section of the ilium's paired midshafts (also found in coelophysids). * Fused distal end of the ischium (also found in neovenatorids and basal tetanurans). Metriacanthosaurines share the following synapomorphies among metriacanthosaurids: * The anteroventral border of the maxillary antorbital fenestra being demarcated by a raised ridge (also found in Eoraptor, coelophysids, Masiakasaurus, Marshosaurus, and Compsognathus). * A pronounced ventral keel on the anterior dorsal vertebrae (also found in Condorraptor, Piatnitzkysaurus, Carcharodontosaurus and many megalosaurians). * A straight posterior margin of the iliac postacetabular process. * The angle between the long axes of the pubic shaft and boot being less than 60 degrees. * A ventrally curved ischial shaft (also found in coelophysids, Eustreptospondylus, Afrovenator, Megalosaurus and Compsognathus). * A bulbous fibular crest on the tibia (also found in Sinosaurus). Classification Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012) noted that the name Metriacanthosauridae should be used as it has priority over Sinraptoridae. Cladistically, Sinraptoridae had been latest defined in 2005 by Paul Sereno as the most inclusive monophyletic group that contains Sinraptor dongi and all species closer related to Sinraptor than to either Allosaurus fragilis, Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, or the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Furthermore, the 2012 study named a new subfamily Metriacanthosaurinae to include all metriacanthosaurids more closely related to Metriacanthosaurus than to Yangchuanosaurus. A much larger phylogenetic analysis found Xuanhanosaurus, previously considered a basal megalosauroid, to be the basalmost metriacanthosaurid. Supporting Information Both Poekilopleuron and Lourinhanosaurus were recovered outside the family, and many taxa within the Metriacanthosauridae were in polytomy. However, the positions of Xuanhanosaurus and Poekilopleuron were very unstable, and their exclusion from the analysis gave a more resolved and stable cladogram. The cladogram presented here follows that study.  Palaeobiogeography  Metriacanthosauridae fossils have only been found in modern Europe and Asia, parts of the prehistoric landmass Laurasia. From those found in Asia, most are from China, with a few discoveries in Thailand and other Asian countries. The group is thought to have originated in Asia and spread westward to Europe. Yangchuanosaurus has only been found in Yangchuan, Sichuan, China. Metriacanthosaurus has been found in Northern Europe. Similar to Yangchuanosaurus, Sinraptor has been found in Sichuan, but also in Xinjiang. In 2008, Xu and Clarke described a large tooth found in the Junggard Basin in Xinjian, China, belonging to a large sinraptorid.Xu, X., and J. M. Clark. \\"The Presence of a Gigantic Theropod in the Jurassic Shishugou Formation, Junggar Basin, Western China.\\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica, 46: 158‚Äì160. www.ivpp.cas.cn/cbw/gjzdwxb/xbwzxz/200811/W020090813369286986655.pdf *. The Late Jurassic Qigu Formation in Xinjiang has also yielded evidence of metriacanthosaurid habitation in the form of sauropod bones with bitemarks most likely belonging to a metriacanthosaurid.

It starts as the extension of Boulevard Greber in the old city of Gatineau and ends at the entrance of the downtown core where it becomes Boulevard Maisonneuve which connects the Portage Bridge towards Ottawa. It was once part of Route 148 until the Quebec Ministry of Transportation rerouted the provincial highway onto Autoroute 50 and Autoroute 5 as a concurrency. The road crosses right in the middle of Lac Leamy Park one of the key greenspaces of the city. A road connects Fournier to the Lake and its beaches itself. Several bike paths connect the boulevard to the lake or Jacques Cartier Park and downtown Gatineau and Ottawa. The artery was named after Alphonse Fournier. Lady Aberdeen Bridge The Lady Aberdeen Bridge that crosses the Gatineau River is the oldest bridge connecting the former city of Gatineau to the former City of Hull. Previously only a two-lane bridge, it was built at the beginning in 1894 and named the Gatineau Bridge. It was renamed Lady Aberdeen for the wife of former Governor General of Canada John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, Ishbel Maria Marjoribanks when she nearly drowned near the bridge while returning from a meeting at the nearby Saint-Fran√ßois-de-Sales church, and was rescued by local villagers. It was replaced in 1931 by the current structure by the Dominion Bridge Company. However, due to the population growth in the Pointe-Gatineau sector, a second bridge that is used for southbound commuters was built. Recently, the city of Gatineau was concerned about the structure of the older portion of the bridge and is doing repairs to solidify it. It imposed a weight restriction on the area prompting heavy trucks to travel on Autoroute 50. Major reconstruction of the old structure started in 2006 and continued for most of 2007. In 2007, the construction forced the shut down of the northbound lanes towards Pointe-Gatineau, diverting the traffic towards the southbound structure with one lane in each direction except during peak periods where it is closed to northbound traffic in the morning and southbound traffic in the afternoon. Cyclist and pedestrian traffic are forced to use the western sidewalk and a narrow lane beside it. Part of the Route Verte provincial bicycle network, TV station CHOT-TV discussed during a news report safety issues during the construction period due to the high risk of accidents between cyclists and vehicles as one of the collisions during the summer was a fatal one. Transit Priorities It is also the main route used by STO buses traveling to and from downtown Gatineau and the old Gatineau sector and there are bus lanes along most of the stretch. Those lanes were necessary due to the very high flow of traffic (sometimes there is much congestion), since this road is used as an alternative to Autoroute 50. Express routes and some regular routes travels on Fournier, but express routes do not serve the stops due to a closed-doors policy that speed up travel time for express users. On both sides of the bridges, there are transit signal priorities in which buses can cross the intersection before the green light preventing to be caught in line-ups. The measures are in place until the STO's Rapibus, which will follow the Quebec-Gatineau Railway Line, will be in operation starting in 2010.

These pollutants cause female sea snails (marine gastropod molluscs) to develop male sex organs such as a penis and a vas deferens. Imposex inducing substances Tributyltin (TBT) hydride model It was believed that the only inducer of imposex was tributyltin (TBT),Ruiz JM, Quintela M, Barreiro R (1998) Tributyltin and imposex: no uncertainty shown. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 170: 293‚Äì294 which can be active in extremely low concentrations, but recent studies reported other substances as inducers, such as triphenyltin and ethanol. Tributyltin is an anti-fouling agent for boats which affects females of the species Nucella lapillus (dog whelk), Voluta ebraea (the Hebrew volute), Olivancillaria vesica, Stramonita haemastoma (red- mouthed rock shell) and more than 200 other marine gastropods. Abnormalities In the dog whelk, the growth of a penis in imposex females gradually blocks the oviduct, although ovule production continues. An imposex female dog whelk passes through several stages of penis growth before it becomes unable to maintain a constant production of ovules. Later stages of imposex lead to sterility and the premature death of the females of reproductive age, which can adversely affect the entire population. Biomonitoring The imposex stages of female dog whelks and other molluscs (including Nucella lima) are used in the United Kingdom and worldwide to monitor levels of tributyltin. The RPSI (Relative Penis Size Index) of females to males, and the VDSI (Vas Deferens Sequence Index) are used to monitor levels of tributyltin in marine environments. On September 29, 2007, the Halifax, Nova Scotia, newspaper The Chronicle Herald featured a story on female dog whelks on the shores of Halifax Harbour and other parts of Nova Scotia, where they live on the beach in the intertidal zone. The report stated that female dog whelks still grow penises even after a ban on tributyltin.\\"Tiny Snail, Big Problem\\" The Chronicle Herald, Halifax, NS, Canada.

It conducts research, promotion, marketing and advocacy in the interests of New Zealand grape growers and winemakers, both domestically and in international export markets. Winemakers and grape growers are automatically entitled to membership of New Zealand Winegrowers through payment of the levies on grape or wine sales required by law in the Commodity Levies Act 1991 and the Wine Act 2003. This combined with New Zealand's small size means that it is the only country in the world with a single national wine industry body.  History  In the early 2000s significant overlaps in mandate and operations were identified in two former national organisations: the Wine Institute of New Zealand, established in 1975, and the New Zealand Grape Growers Council. These organisations were merged in 2002 to become a single organisation, New Zealand Winegrowers, which was finally incorporated in 2016. New Zealand Winegrowers in its 2017 annual report set a target of $2 billion NZD of export revenue by 2020. It believes this can be achieved due to New Zealand's reputation internationally for high quality wines with a higher per-unit price, and the continuing rapid growth of vineyard planting area in New Zealand, from in 1997 to in 2017.

In 2015, the combined market capitalisation of listed companies on the Dhaka bourse stood at over $40 billion. History First incorporated as East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd on 28 April 1954 and started formal trading in 1956. It was renamed as East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd on 23 June 1962. Again renamed as Dacca Stock Exchange Ltd on 13 May 1964. After the liberation war in 1971 the trading was discontinued for five years. In 1976 trading restarted in Bangladesh, on 16 September 1986 DSE was started. The formula for calculating DSE all share price index was changed according to IFC on 1 November 1993. The automated trading was initiated on 10 August 1998 and started on 1 January 2001. A Central Securities Depository System was initiated on 24 January 2004. As of 16 November 2009, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) crossed 4000 points for the first time, setting another new high at 4148 points. In 2010, the index crossed 8500 points and finally crashed in the first quarter of 2011. Millions of investors lost their money and came out onto the street blaming the speculators and regulators for the bubble that finally burst in what became known as the 2011 Bangladesh share market scam. Currently, there are total 22 industrial sectors in DSE which accommodate 578 listed companies. Formation Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is a public limited company. It is formed and managed under Company Act 1994, Security and Exchange Commission Act 1993, Security and Exchange Commission Regulation 1994, and Security Exchange (Inside Trading) regulation 1994. The issued capital of this company is Tk. 500,000 which is divided up to 250 shares each pricing Tk. 2000. No individual or firm can buy more than one share. According to stock market rule only members can participate in the floor and can buy shares for himself or his clients. At present it has 238 members. Market capitalisation of the Dhaka Stock Exchange reached nearly $9 billion in September 2007 and $27.4 billion on 9 December 2009. Management The management and operation of Dhaka Stock Exchange is entrusted on a 25 members board of directors. Among them 12 are elected from DSE members, another 12 are selected from different trade bodies and relevant organisations. The CEO is the 25th ex officio member of the board. The government has appointed Professor Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, who teaches banking and insurance at Dhaka University, as the chairman of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, reports bdnews24.com. Prof Shibli, who had been heading Sadharan Bima Corporation as its chairman for about three and a half years, will head the stocks regulator for four years, the finance ministry said in a notice on Sunday. He got the new assignment as incumbent chief M Khairul Hossain‚Äôs nine-year stint at the commission came to an end on May 14. Khairul, a Dhaka University finance teacher, had three terms at the helm of the SEC.https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/stock/bangladesh/prof- shibli-named-sec-chairman-1589720232 The following organisations are currently holding positions in DSE Board: * Bangladesh Bank * ICB ‚Äì Investment Corporation of Bangladesh * President of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh * President of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries * President of Metropolitan Chambers of Commerce and Industries * Professor of Finance Department of Dhaka University * President of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce & Industry.

Noise from traffic, in particular, is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the worst environmental stressors for humans, second only to air pollution. Elevated workplace or environmental noise can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, annoyance, and sleep disturbance. Changes in the immune system and birth defects have been also attributed to noise exposure. Although age-related health effects (presbycusis) occur naturally with age, in many countries the cumulative impact of noise is sufficient to impair the hearing of a large fraction of the population over the course of a lifetime.Senate Public Works Committee, Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, S. Rep. No. 1160, 92nd Cong. 2nd session Noise exposure has been known to induce noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, hypertension, vasoconstriction, and other cardiovascular adverse effects. Chronic noise exposure has been associated with sleep disturbances and increased incidence of diabetes. Adverse cardiovascular effects occur from chronic exposure to noise due to the sympathetic nervous system's inability to habituate. The sympathetic nervous system maintains lighter stages of sleep when the body is exposed to noise, which does not allow blood pressure to follow the normal rise and fall cycle of an undisturbed circadian rhythm. Stress from time spent around elevated noise levels has been linked with increased workplace accident rates and aggression and other anti-social behaviors. The most significant sources are vehicles, aircraft, prolonged exposure to loud music, and industrial noise. There are approximately 10,000 deaths per year as a result of noise in the European Union. Noise induced hearing loss Noise-induced hearing loss is a permanent shift in pure-tone thresholds, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. The severity of a threshold shift is dependent on duration and severity of noise exposure. Noise-induced threshold shifts are seen as a notch on an audiogram from 3000‚Äì6000 Hz, but most often at 4000 Hz. Exposure to loud noises, either in a single traumatic experience or over time, can damage the auditory system and result in hearing loss and sometimes tinnitus as well. Traumatic noise exposure can happen at work (e.g. loud machinery), at play (e.g. loud sporting events, concerts, recreational activities), and/or by accident (e.g. a backfiring engine.) Noise induced hearing loss is sometimes unilateral and typically causes patients to lose hearing around the frequency of the triggering sound trauma.  Tinnitus  Tinnitus is an auditory disorder characterized by the perception of a sound (ringing, chirping, buzzing, etc.) in the ear in the absence of an external sound source. There are two types of tinnitus: subjective and objective. Subjective is the most common and can only be heard \\"in the head\\" by the person affected. Objective tinnitus can be heard from those around the affected person and the audiologist can hear it using a stethoscope.Tinnitus can also be categorised by the way it sounds in one's ear, pulsatile tinnitus which is caused by the vascular nature of Glomus tumours and non-pulsatile tinnitus which usually sounds like crickets, the sea and bees. Though the pathophysiology of tinnitus isn't known, noise exposure can be a contributing factor, therefore tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, generated by the cochlea and central nervous system (CNS). High frequency hearing loss causes a high pitched tinnitus and low frequency hearing loss causes a roaring tinnitus. Noise- induced tinnitus can be temporary or permanent depending on the type and amount of noise a person was exposed to. Cardiovascular effects Noise has been associated with important cardiovascular health problems, particularly hypertension. Noise levels of 50 dB(A) or greater at night may increase the risk of myocardial infarction by chronically elevating cortisol production. Traffic noise has several negative effects, including increased risk for coronary artery disease, with night-time exposure to noise possibly more harmful than day-time exposure. It has also been shown to increase blood pressure in individuals within the surrounding residential areas, with railways causing the greatest cardiovascular effects. Roadway noise levels are sufficient to constrict arterial blood flow and lead to elevated blood pressure. Vasoconstriction can result from elevated adrenaline levels or through medical stress reactions. Long-term exposure to noise is correlated to increase in cortisol and angiotensin-II levels which are respectively associated with oxidative stress and vascular inflammation. Individuals subject to great than 80 dB(A) in the workplace are at increased risk of having increased blood pressure. Other physical health effects Traffic noise may also increase the risk of stroke, diabetes, and becoming overweight.  Psychological impacts of noise  Causal relationships have been discovered between noise and psychological effects such as annoyance, psychiatric disorders, and effects on psychosocial well-being. Exposure to intense levels of noise can cause personality changes and violent reactions. Noise has also been shown to be a factor that attributed to violent reactions. The psychological impacts of noise also include an addiction to loud music. This was researched in a study where non-professional musicians were found to have loudness addictions more often than non-musician control subjects. Psychological health effects from noise include depression and anxiety. Individuals who have hearing loss, including noise induced hearing loss, may have their symptoms alleviated with the use of hearing aids. Individuals who do not seek treatment for their loss are 50% more likely to have depression than their aided peers. These psychological effects can lead to detriments in physical care in the form of reduced self-care, work-tolerance, and increased isolation. Auditory stimuli can serve as psychological triggers for individuals with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Stress  Research commissioned by Rockwool, a multi-national insulation manufacturer headquartered in Denmark, reveals that in the UK one third (33%) of victims of domestic disturbances claim loud parties have left them unable to sleep or made them stressed in the last two years. Around one in eleven (9%) of those affected by domestic disturbances claims it has left them continually disturbed and stressed. More than 1.8 million people claim noisy neighbours have made their life a misery and they cannot enjoy their own homes. The impact of noise on health is potentially a significant problem across the UK given that more than 17.5 million Britons (38%) have been disturbed by the inhabitants of neighbouring properties in the last two year. For almost one in ten (7%) Britons this is a regular occurrence. The extent of the problem of noise pollution for public health is reinforced by figures collated by Rockwool from local authority responses to a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request. This research reveals in the period April 2008 - 2009 UK councils received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 noise abatement notices, or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act. Westminster City Council has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in London.  Annoyance  Sudden impulse noises are typically perceived as more bothersome than noise from traffic of equal volume.Miedema and Oudshoorn 2001 cited in Annoyance effects of noise are minimally affected by demographics, but fear of the noise source and sensitivity to noise both strongly affect the 'annoyance' of a noise. Sound levels as low as 40 dB(A) can generate noise complaints and the lower threshold for noise producing sleep disturbance is 45 dB(A) or lower. Other factors that affect the 'annoyance level' of sound include beliefs about noise prevention and the importance of the noise source, and annoyance at the cause (i.e. non-noise related factors) of the noise. Many of the interpretations of the level of annoyance and the relationship between noise levels and resulting health symptoms could be influenced by the quality of interpersonal relationships at the workplace, as well as the stress level generated by the work itself. Evidence for impact on annoyance of long-term noise versus recent changes is equivocal. Approximately 35% to 40% of office workers find noise levels from 55 to 60 dB(A) extremely irritating. The noise standard in Germany for mentally stressful tasks is set at 55 dB(A), however, if the noise source is continuous, the threshold level for tolerability among office workers is lower than 55 dB(A). Child physical development The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authored a pamphlet in 1978 that suggested a correlation between low-birthweight (using the World Health Organization definition of less than and high sound levels, and also high rates of birth defects in places where expectant mothers are exposed to elevated sound levels, such as typical airport environs. Specific birth abnormalities included harelip, cleft palate, and defects in the spine.Noise: A Health Problem United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978 According to Lester W. Sontag of The Fels Research Institute (as presented in the same EPA study): ‚ÄúThere is ample evidence that environment has a role in shaping the physique, behavior, and function of animals, including man, from conception and not merely from birth. The fetus is capable of perceiving sounds and responding to them by motor activity and cardiac rate change.\\" The effects of noise exposure are highest when it occurs between 15 and 60 days after conception, a period in which major internal organs and the central nervous system are formed. Later developmental effects occur as vasoconstriction in the mother reduces blood flow and therefore oxygen and nutrition to the fetus. Low birth weights and noise were also associated with lower levels of certain hormones in the mother. These hormones are thought to affect fetal growth and to be good indicators of protein production. The difference between the hormone levels of pregnant mothers in noisy versus quiet areas increased as birth approached. In a 2000 publication, a review of studies on birthweight and noise exposure note that while some older studies suggest that when women are exposed to >65 dB aircraft noise a small decrease in birthweight occurs, in a more recent study of 200 Taiwanese women including noise dosimetry measurements of individual noise exposure, the authors found no significant association between noise exposure and birth weight after adjusting for relevant confounders, e.g. social class, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, etc. Cognitive development When young children are regularly exposed to levels of noise that interfere with speech, they may develop speech or reading difficulties, because auditory processing functions are compromised. Children continue to develop their speech perception abilities until they reach their teens. Evidence has shown that when children learn in noisier classrooms, they have more difficulties understanding speech than those who learn in quieter settings. In a study conducted by Cornell University in 1993, children exposed to noise in learning environments experienced trouble with word discrimination, as well as various cognitive developmental delays. In particular, the writing learning impairment dysgraphia is commonly associated with environmental stressors in the classroom. High noise levels have also been known to damage the physical health of small children. Children from noisy residences often have a heart rate that is significantly higher (by 2 beats/min on average) than those of children from quieter homes.  Prevention  Different styles of earplugs are pictured. Left, pre-molded earplugs. Center, formable earplugs. Right, roll-down foam earplugs. A hearing protection device (HPD) is an ear protection device worn in or over the ears while exposed to hazardous noise to help prevent noise-induced hearing loss. HPDs reduce (not eliminate) the level of the noise entering the ear. HPDs can also protect against other effects of noise exposure such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. Proper hygiene and care of HPDs may reduce chances of outer ear infections. There are many different types of HPDs available for use, including earmuffs, earplugs, electronic hearing protection devices, and semi- insert devices. One can measure the personal attenuation rating through a hearing protection fit-testing system. Earmuff style hearing protection devices are designed to fit over the outer ear, or pinna. Earmuff HPDs typically consist of two ear cups and a head band. Earplug style hearing protection devices are designed to fit in the ear canal. Earplugs come in a variety of different subtypes. Some HPDs reduce the sound reaching the eardrum through a combination of electronic and structural components. Electronic HPDs are available in both earmuff and custom earplug styles. Electronic microphones, circuitry, and receivers perform active noise reduction, also known as noise-cancelling, in which a signal that is 180-degrees out-of-phase of the noise is presented, which in theory cancels the noise. Canal caps are similar to earplugs in that they consists of soft tip that is inserted into the opening of the ear canal. Regulations Environmental noise regulations usually specify a maximum outdoor noise level of 60 to 65 dB(A), while occupational safety organizations recommend that the maximum exposure to noise is 40 hours per week at 85 to 90 dB(A). For every additional 3 dB(A), the maximum exposure time is reduced by a factor 2, e.g. 20 hours per week at 88 dB(A). Sometimes, a factor of two per additional 5 dB(A) is used, however, these occupational regulations are acknowledged by the health literature as inadequate to protect against hearing loss and other health effects. In an effort to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, many programs and initiative have been created, like the Buy Quiet program, which encourages employers to purchase quieter tools and equipment, and the Safe-In-Sound Award, which recognizes organizations with successful hearing loss prevention strategies. With regard to indoor noise pollution in residences, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not set any restrictions on limits to the level of noise. Rather, it has provided a list of recommended levels in its Model Community Noise Control Ordinance, which was published in 1975. For instance, the recommended noise level for indoor residences is less than or equal to 45 dB. Noise pollution control in residences is not funded by the federal government in part because of the disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the effect of noise is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body. For instance, hearing loss could be attributed to a variety of factors including age, rather than solely due to excessive exposure to noise. A state or local government is able to regulate indoor residential noise, however, such as when excessive noise from within a home causes disturbances to nearby residences. Effects on dogs While people are often educated on the effects of noise exposure in humans, there are also different noise exposure effects in animals as well. An example of this would be in dogs, and the noise exposure levels occurring within kennels. Dogs experience this noise exposure whether it be a long stay at an animal shelter, or a weekend stay at a boarding facility. Organizations like NIOSH and OSHA have different regulations when it comes to the noise exposure levels in industrial workers. Currently there are no regulations related to the noise exposure for dogs even with such damaging effects related to their health. Health risks dogs are exposed to include ear damage and behavioral changes. The average noise exposure in a kennel is greater than 100 dB SPL. According to OSHA these levels would yield in the use of hearing protection for the workers of those kennels due to the risk of noise induced hearing loss. The anatomical structures of the human and dog ears are very similar, so it is thought that these levels will negatively impact the hearing of canines in kennels. The ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of dogs, and can be used to show either a temporary threshold shift or permanent threshold shift after being exposed to excessive sound levels. Behavioral effects to excessive noise exposure include hiding, urinating, defecating, panting, pacing, drooling, disregard to commands, trembling, and barking. These behavioral patterns pose a much greater problem to canines than meets the eye. All of these behavioral patterns are characteristics that result in a longer stay at the kennels before being adopted. A longer stay at the shelter results in a longer duration of noise exposure and therefore more likely to show either a temporary or permanent threshold shift in the canine's hearing. These excessive noise levels are not only harming the dogs physical and psychological state, but the workers' and potential adoptive families' physical and psychological state as well. The workers' psychological state could affect the care provided to the dogs. These loud noise exposures also have the potential to reduce the amount of time that potential adoptive families spend in the facility. This can result in less dogs being adopted and more time being exposed to excessive sound levels. To reduce the level of noise exposure poses a little more difficulty because the majority of the noise is coming from the dogs (barking), but structural changes can be made to the facilities in order to reduce the noise. Structural changes could include how many dogs are put in one area, more absorbing material rather than metal cages and cement walls and floors, and possibly in the future use of hearing protection devices (HPD) for the dogs. All of these structural changes would also benefit the humans involved as well as the use of HPD's (ear plugs).

It is located about south of Florence and north of Siena. Sitting in the Val di Greve, it is named for the small, fast-flowing river that runs through it, is the principal town in the Chianti wine district which stretches south of Florence to just north of Siena. Until recently it has been a quiet, almost bucolic town because it was, and still is, well off the main roads. Even in ancient days Greve was not isolated because it was well-connected by secondary roads to the Via Volterrana and via Francigena. Nowadays, it is connected to the A1 superstrada between Florence and Rome and the main road between Florence and Siena. The old road network ensured easy access to Florence and to other places such as Figline where its tradesmen and farmers found ready markets for their goods and produce. History The site of Greve and the surrounding territory has been long settled, probably well before the Etruscans and then the Romans dominated the area. Historical documents of the 11th century refer to an ancient monastic settlement on a nearby hill, which is now called the hill of San Francesco. Before the Franciscans established their monastery in the 15th century, an earlier monastery dedicated to Santo Savi had already been built, and also a small hospital. Larger scale settlement occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries. Although an independent town for most of its history, Greve ultimately came under Florentine control and remained so until the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was absorbed into the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Main sights The Franciscan monastery is still at the heart of the old part of the city, as is the triangular main piazza, where a market has been running more or less continuously for centuries serving the nearby castle communities and hamlets. The piazza is fronted by numerous medieval aged buildings, including the 11th century Chiesa Santa Croce which was rebuilt in 1325 after being burned to the ground, along with the rest of the town, by the Duke of Lucca, Castruccio Castracani. After further renovation, the church, which houses paintings of the school of Fra Angelico, now features a neo-classical fa√ßade. In the piazza there is also a monument to navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano, who was possibly born nearby, however more recent scholarly work places his birth at Lyon France. In the frazione of Montefioralle is the church of Santo Stefano, with a late 13th-century Madonna with Child and a 15th-century Trinity and Saints. Also in the hamlet is a house which, according to the tradition, belonged to explorer Amerigo Vespucci. In the nearby is a Romanesque Pieve with narthexed fa√ßade and two mullioned windows. Church Santa Maria Castello in Panzano At from the centre of Greve is the castle of Verrazzano, sitting on a high hill. Built probably by the Lombards, it was a possession of the explorer's family, and in the 17th century was turned into a villa. Of the 13th-century manor a tower remains. In the neighbourhood of the frazione of Panzano is the Pieve of San Leolino, known from the 10th century. The interior houses a 13th-century panel by Meliore di Jacopo, a 15th-century polyptych by the so-called Master of Panzano, as well as works by Raffaellino del Garbo and Giovanni della Robbia. Wine production With the enlargement of the Chianti wine district in 1932, Greve suddenly found itself in a noble wine area. The Chianti region supports a variety of agricultural activities, most especially the growing of the grapes that go into the world-famous Chianti and \\"Super Tuscan\\" wines. Olive oil production is another staple of the local economy. Extra virgin Tuscan olive oil is highly prized for its delicate flavor, as opposed to the stronger, thicker olive oils of the south. Truffle harvesting is a distinguishing feature of local food production. Both black and white truffles are hunted in Chianti. The region is also noted for its meat. The Cinta Senese pig is unique to this region and produces pork of superior quality. Wild game is a common feature on local menus, including rabbit, pigeon, venison, and, especially, cinghiale (wild boar). Greve is home to one of Italy's oldest and most renowned butcher shops, the Macelleria Falorni. Due largely to this intense agricultural activity, and the wine and food production industries that have been built on top of it, since early medieval times, Greve evolved as the principal market town at the center of an (increasingly) densely populated area with an abundance of villages, parish churches, villas and castles. The latter were built mostly by the rich merchants and noble classes of Florence who enjoyed the country life, and developed their estates to earn additional income and also to supply their in-town tables. The town of Greve's busy quaintness and the lushness and diversity of the undulating landscape which surrounds it, have long attracted tourists and travelers. The current flow of tourism to the area and the purchase of homes by both Italians and foreigners is fully integrated with viniculture, wine-making and various related enterprises to form a highly integrated and highly productive local economy. Annual wine festival Mayor of Greve in Chianti visiting their sister city, Sonoma, California, in 2013 Chianti Classico wine festival - every year on second weekend of September and the preceding Thursday and Friday, 5 - 8th Sept 2013. On Thursday, the festival starts at about 5 pm, and on Saturday and Sunday at about 11 am and the stands close at about 8 pm.

It is an American college football rivalry game played by the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars and University of Utah Utes. The game is part of the larger BYU‚ÄìUtah rivalry. In this rivalry context, the term \\"Holy War\\" refers to the fact that BYU is owned and administered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the University of Utah is a public university owned and administered by the state of Utah. The proximity of the two schools, the athletic successes of the two teams, and the longevity of the series also contribute to the rivalry. Both teams played in the same conference from 1922 to 2010 and the Holy War game often decided the conference title. Despite Utah moving to the Pac-12 Conference in 2011 and BYU becoming an independent that same year, the two universities agreed to play between 2011 and 2013 prior to a brief interruption in the series for 2014 and 2015 ‚Äî the first since 1943 to 1945, when BYU did not field a team due to World War II. Games have since been scheduled until 2028. The two-year hiatus was unexpectedly cut short when the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl pitted BYU against Utah, creating the \\"Holy War in Sin City\\" in the postseason.  Rivalry components There are a number of components that make the Holy War particularly fierce. The University of Utah and Brigham Young University are two of the biggest colleges in the state of Utah. As the name of the rivalry implies, religion is a large component to the rivalry. The University of Utah has a large LDS student population while Brigham Young University is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has an almost entirely LDS student population. The long length of rivalry is also a major element. Religion The University of Utah is the flagship university of the state of Utah, a state known for its substantial LDS population and being home to the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while Brigham Young University is the flagship university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The matchup has been described as taking on religious, or \\"church vs. state\\" undertones. Longevity The two schools disagree on when the first game was played. Utah claims that the first game was played in 1896 against Brigham Young Academy. BYU's athletic website shows their schedule dating back to 1922, but no earlier. Utah claims a lead of 61‚Äì34‚Äì4, while BYU claims Utah leads 58‚Äì31‚Äì4. BYU does not count the six games between Utah and Brigham Young Academy in its records. Utah has a large lead in the overall series and has dominated the rivalry both prior to 1972 (41‚Äì8‚Äì4) and since 1993 (18‚Äì7). From 1972 to 1992 BYU dominated the series with a record of 19‚Äì2 versus Utah. Since 1980, when BYU won 56-6, the largest point spread is 44 points, which occurred in 2011 when Utah won 54‚Äì10 in Provo. Proximity BYU, which is in Provo, Utah, and the University of Utah, which is in Salt Lake City, are about apart and approximately an hour's drive away on Interstate 15. Consequently, the two teams compete for recruits and fan support. It is not uncommon for friends, neighbors, and even family members to have opposite allegiances. Successful teams While the two teams have not necessarily been strong at the same time, the two teams had the most conference championships in the Mountain West Conference (MW) before both left the MW in 2011. Each team has had four conference championships since the creation of the MW in 1999. Including championships of other conferences, Utah has 24 conference championships in its history, while BYU has 23. Both of these numbers are well ahead of the current MW member with the most conference championships, Colorado State, who has 15. Other than the 2011 meeting, the recent games in the Holy War have tended to be close, with the final score of fifteen of the last nineteen games being within a touchdown (seven points, including a successful conversion kick) or less. BYU lays claim to a consensus national championship for going undefeated in 1984 and beating Michigan in the 1984 Holiday Bowl. During the era of the now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (1998‚Äì2013), Utah played in two BCS bowls: the 2005 Fiesta Bowl (a 35‚Äì7 victory over Pitt) and the 2009 Sugar Bowl (a 31‚Äì17 victory over Alabama). For these BCS bowl victories, Utah finished ranked in the AP Poll #4 and #2, respectively. Many sports media members and observers, including ESPN's Rick Reilly, argued that Utah (the nation's lone undefeated FBS team) should have been awarded the AP National Championship and should have been selected to play Florida in the BCS title game. Utah had been selected by at least one National organization as the number one team for the 2008 season.  Fanbase comparisons  In 2011 the New York Times polled fans of all current FBS schools to rank them according to the size of their respective fan bases. BYU was ranked #43 nationally with 709,864 people self-identifying as BYU fans while Utah was ranked #67 with 351,939 people self-identifying as fans. In 2017 Utah saw an average of 45,913 fans attend home games and 52,489 fans on the road (including a bowl game). Rice-Eccles Stadium holds a maximum of 45,807 meaning that the stadium was always over 100% capacity and utilized standing-room-only areas. BYU averaged 56,267 fans at home and 35,019 at away games. LaVell Edwards Stadium has a capacity of 63,470 meaning that the stadium was filled, on average, at only 88% of capacity.  Series history =The University of Deseret The University of Deseret was established February 28, 1850 by the General Assembly of the provisional State of Deseret. This date is enshrined on The Seal of the University of Utah. The University of Deseret closed in 1853 and was reestablished in 1867. In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, to coincide with Utah's first Football team, who won 1 and lost 2 in their first campaign, including a loss to future rival Utah State. The University of Utah was controlled by The Church from its founding until well after Statehood in 1896. The Brigham Young Academy years Before 1903, BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy (BYA). During the 1890s, Utah and BYA played six times in football. The two schools split the series 3‚Äì3. BYA stopped playing football in 1900, following a player death,Harmon, Dick, and Steve Cameron. Wild Blue Yonder: The High Flying Story of BYU Football. Lenexa, Kan.: Addax Pub. Group, 1997. Print. and did not start again until 1922, after it had become Brigham Young University (BYU). BYU does not recognize these first six meetings as it only recognizes football games played from 1922 onward.  Utah's early dominance  After twenty-three years of not having a team, BYU resumed play for the 1922 season. Utah began its early dominance over BYU with a 49‚Äì0 victory on October 14, 1922. BYU would not get another win in the series until 1942, when the Cougars shocked the Utes 12‚Äì7 at Utah. The rivalry then took a hiatus from 1943 to 1945 because BYU did not field a team due to World War II. When the rivalry continued in 1946, the Utes continued their domination over the Cougars, winning or tying the next twelve contests. Save for a three-year BYU winning streak from 1965‚Äì1967, the rivalry continued this trend through the 1971 season, at which point Utah had amassed a 41‚Äì8‚Äì4 () record against BYU.  The LaVell Edwards era  In 1972, the rivalry shifted in favor of BYU. The Cougars had hired LaVell Edwards and in his first season, BYU beat Utah 16‚Äì7 for BYU's first victory over Utah in four years. The win signaled the beginning of BYU's dominance against Utah. From 1972 to 1992, BYU went 19‚Äì2 () against Utah. During those years, Utah went through a series of coaches that all ended with losing records against LaVell Edwards and BYU. Bill Meek's Utes went 0‚Äì2 against Edwards during Meek's last two years (1972‚Äì1973). Tom Lovat (1974‚Äì1976) was 0‚Äì3. Wayne Howard (1977‚Äì1981) was 1‚Äì4. Chuck Stobart (1982‚Äì1984) was 0‚Äì3. Jim Fassel was 1‚Äì4. Finally, Utah found some success when it hired Ron McBride in 1990. McBride would finish with a 5‚Äì6 record against LaVell Edwards, but he started with three consecutive losses to Edwards. =1977‚Äì1981: Edwards versus HowardWayne Howard's Crusade During the 1977 meeting, BYU was on the way to winning in a 38‚Äì8 blowout. Nonetheless, LaVell Edwards put starting quarterback Marc Wilson back into the game so Wilson could set an NCAA record for passing yards. Wilson succeeded in setting the record (subsequently broken) and finished the game with 571 passing yards. The incident infuriated Utah head coach Wayne Howard. After the game, he said, \\"This today will be inspiring. The hatred between BYU and Utah is nothing compared to what it will be. It will be a crusade to beat BYU from now on. This is a prediction: in the next two years Utah will drill BYU someday, but we won‚Äôt run up the score even if we could set an NCAA record against them.\\" The next year, Wayne Howard made good on his promise. The Utes came from behind to upset the Cougars 23‚Äì22. The 1978 win was Utah's first against a LaVell Edwards coached BYU team. Jim McMahon says, \\"Scoreboard.\\" During the 1980 Holy War, BYU quarterback Jim McMahon helped engineer a blowout. Most of the game he was heckled by a contingent of Utah fans at Rice Stadium. After throwing for another touchdown late in the 56‚Äì6 win, he simply pointed at the scoreboard to quiet the hecklers. The game was in the midst of a 12‚Äì1 BYU season. It was also their second consecutive win against Utah and their eighth win out of the last nine games against Utah. The fifty point margin of victory is the largest for either team in the series. =1982‚Äì1984: Edwards versus Stobart= On November 17, 1984, BYU entered the Holy War 10‚Äì0 and ranked #3 in the AP Poll. BYU overcame several turnovers to win 24‚Äì14. BYU would finish the season 13‚Äì0 and the only undefeated team in Division I-A (now the Football Bowl Subdivision). They were voted number one in the final AP Poll as well as the Coaches' Poll to become consensus national champions. This was the last time a team outside the current Power Five conferences won a national championship; the next most recent was Army in 1945. =1985‚Äì1989: Edwards versus FasselThe Rice Bowl In 1988, Utah had not beaten BYU since 1978 and entered the Holy War as 11-point underdogs. Utah had a mediocre 5‚Äì5 record while BYU was 8‚Äì2 and had already accepted an invitation to the Freedom Bowl. BYU looked ready to humiliate the Utes again. Instead Utah and quarterback Scott Mitchell jumped on BYU early and took a 21‚Äì0 lead on the way to winning 57‚Äì28. The 1988 team set a series record for points scored against BYU‚Äîa record that stands today. The game came to be known locally as \\"the Rice Bowl\\" because the game was played at Utah's Rice Stadium. Revenge The next year, in 1989, BYU got their revenge. They set a series record by scoring 70 against Utah. BYU jumped to a 49‚Äì0 lead before Utah scored its first touchdown just before halftime. Behind quarterback Ty Detmer, BYU would score eight touchdowns on its first eight possessions and amass over 750 yards of total offense during the 70‚Äì31 win. Utah would score three touchdowns in the fourth quarter against BYU's reserves. The 101 points the two teams scored is still a series record.  The modern rivalry  By the mid-1990s, the Cougars' success leveled off from the years of the 1970s and '80s. Around this time, the Utes also improved significantly, and the rivalry became much more competitive. =1990‚Äì2000: Edwards versus McBride= The rivalry began to change in 1993, during Ron McBride's fourth season as head coach, the Utes won their first game in Provo in twenty-two seasons and their first since LaVell Edwards became BYU head coach. Late in the fourth quarter, Utah's kicker Chris Yergensen, who had already missed two out of three field goals on the day, attempted to break the 31‚Äì31 tie. This time, Yergensen did not miss and kicked the game-winning 55-yard field goal, the longest of his career, with less than a minute remaining. After the win, Utah fans and players attempted to tear down the north end zone goalpost at what was then Cougar Stadium. Cougar players returned to the field to protect the goalpost from being torn down. About the incident, Lenny Gomes, a BYU nose guard, said, \\"Typical Utah bullshit. All those guys think that's all there is to life. But when I'm making $50‚Äì60,000 a year, they'll be pumping my gas. They're low-class losers.\\" The remark is still remembered in rivalry history today. The 1994 season was McBride's best, as he led the Utes to a 10‚Äì2 record and a top-10 finish in national rankings. The Utes and Cougars also staged one of the best matchups in the rivalry's history, meeting for the first time as top-25 ranked teams. The Utes won the game 34‚Äì31, which was coincidentally the same score of their meeting a year before. Utah ran its rivalry winning streak up to three games a year later, with a 34‚Äì17 win at BYU. The Utes and Cougars would trade wins and losses the next couple of years, before the 2000 season. The Kaneshiro Doink In 1998, the first Holy War was played at the newly renovated Rice-Eccles Stadium. BYU entered the game with an 8‚Äì3 (6‚Äì1 WAC) record and was playing for a berth in the WAC Championship game. Utah entered the game with a 7‚Äì3 (5‚Äì2 WAC) record and was hoping to land a bowl game and spoil BYU's WAC Championship hopes. BYU took a 26‚Äì17 lead when Owen Pochman connected on a 47-yard field goal with 2:41 left to play in the game. On the ensuing kickoff, Utah's Daniel Jones returned the ball 95 yards to cut the lead to 26‚Äì24. Utah's defense held BYU and forced them to punt. Utah moved the ball to the 15-yard line where Ryan Kaneshiro attempted a 32-yard field goal. The attempt bounced off the right upright, which preserved the win for BYU and caused the goalpost to shake from the \\"doink\\". Utah cheerleader pummels an aggressive fan During the 1999 edition of the Holy War, Utah recorded its fourth consecutive win in Provo. Early in the fourth quarter, Utah scored a touchdown when quarterback T.D. Crowshaw completed a four-yard-pass to Donny Utu to put Utah up 20‚Äì10. In celebration, Utah cheerleader Billy Priddis ran along the visitor's sideline with a large \\"U\\" flag. A BYU fanhttp://www.mormonstoday.com/991205/P2Perry01.shtml who was later banned from the BYU campus, ran onto the sideline and tackled Priddis from behind. Priddis turned around and started punching the fan. He landed seven or eight punches before security separated them. About the incident, Priddis said, \\"There's 65,000 fans here, does he think I'm not going to retaliate?\\" From the Utah sideline, receiver Steve Smith taunted BYU fans and yelled, \\"Even our cheerleaders are kicking your butt.\\" BYU's athletic director Val Hale purported to have chastised Priddis and the rest of the Utah cheerleaders. After the game, he said, \\"I told them from now on we're going to leave our flags at home and they should do the same. All it does is initiate the fans to throw things out of the stands.\\" Edwards' last game Entering the 2000 season, legendary head coach LaVell Edwards announced that he was retiring. His final game as Cougars head coach came against the Utes in Salt Lake City, where BYU won 34‚Äì27 with an exciting last-minute drive that ended on a touchdown with little time remaining on the clock. =2001 and 2002: Crowton versus McBride= In 2001, under new head coach Gary Crowton, BYU entered their game against Utah undefeated and looking to become the first team from outside the BCS to play in a BCS bowl game. A tight game ended with a comeback by BYU. BYU running back Luke Staley raced down the sideline with 1:16 left to play to make it 24‚Äì21 and BYU DB Jenaro Gilford intercepted a pass on the ensuing Ute drive to seal the victory. The win gave the Cougars consecutive wins against the Utes for the first time in nearly ten years. The Cougs, however, failed to bust the BCS, losing to Hawaii in their final game. McBride, who had guided Utah to six bowl games and three bowl wins, entered the 2002 rivalry game in danger of being fired. The Utes had struggled all season long and even with their 13‚Äì6 victory against BYU, Utah finished with their second losing season in three years. The 5‚Äì6 finish sealed McBride's fate and he was fired in 2002; Weber State University hired him in December 2004. =2003 and 2004: Crowton versus Meyer= Urban Meyer was hired to replace Ron McBride. Under Meyer, Utah players were not allowed to use the name BYU and began referring rather to the Team Down South or TDS (BYU being about 50 miles south of the University of Utah), imitating Ohio State coach Woody Hayes practice of referring to Michigan as \\"that team up north.\\" This reference has become a tradition among Utah fans. Scoring streak ends In Meyer's first season, the Utes won the Mountain West Conference and finished 10‚Äì2, which was their best record since the 1994 season. The last game of the regular season, Utah beat BYU for the second straight year with a 3‚Äì0 victory. The victory snapped BYU's NCAA record for scoring in 361 straight games‚ÄîBYU's first shutout since a 20‚Äì0 loss to Arizona State on September 25, 1975. BCS busters Utah fans carry the goalpost after the Utes defeated the Cougars to complete a perfect regular season In 2004 Utah would have its best season up to that point, going 12‚Äì0 and becoming the first team from outside the BCS to play in a BCS bowl game. They went on to win their matchup against Pittsburgh in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. The Utes final regular season game, a 52‚Äì21 victory over BYU, clinched the invitation to a BCS bowl. Urban Meyer then left Utah for Florida. After the 2004 season, Gary Crowton resigned after finishing with his third consecutive losing season. =2005‚Äì2015: Mendenhall versus Whittingham= In 2005, Bronco Mendenhall and Kyle Whittingham started as head coaches at their respective programs. Whittingham was offered the job at BYU before turning it down and accepting the position at Utah. This has added to the rivalry between the two coaches. Whittingham won the overall series against Mendenhall with a tally of 7‚Äì3. Eight of the ten games were decided by a touchdown or less. In a December 17, 2009 column, writer Stewart Mandel called the coaching rivalry the best coaching rivalry of that decade. First overtime game The 2005 season saw some striking parallels between the two programs. Both had replaced their former head coaches, struggled through parts of their seasons, and would finish the regular season with 6‚Äì5 records. When the two met in Provo in November 2005, BYU was looking for its first win against the Utes in three seasons. Utah was looking for a winning record and a shot at a bowl game. BYU entered as the favorite because Utah would be playing without its starting quarterback and its best wide receiver, who had been injured in their previous game. The Utes were starting JC transfer Brett Ratliff who had taken just three snaps the week before. Ratliff surprised the Cougars by completing 17 of 32 passes for 240 yards and four touchdowns, and rushing for 112 yards on 19 carries and a touchdown. He was responsible for all five Utah touchdowns. The Utes won 41‚Äì34. Beck to Harline When the two teams met again in November 2006, this time in Salt Lake City, BYU jumped out to an early lead, then fell behind and trailed for much of the game, but finally won it 33‚Äì31 with an impressive last-minute drive, capped by a touchdown pass from John Beck to Jonny Harline with no time on the clock. The win gave BYU an undefeated record of 8‚Äì0 in Mountain West Conference play. Harline caught the pass on his knees in the end zone with no Utah defender near him. The play led to BYU fans creating and wearing T-shirts reading \\"Harline's still open.\\" Magic happens In 2007, the teams clashed on November 24, in what was a mostly defensive game. The game's first 12 points were only field goals, BYU's Mitch Payne scoring 9 points. Utah then scored the first touchdown, taking the lead 10‚Äì9. In the fourth quarter, BYU came back with a late-game drive that included a 4th and 18 from its own 12-yard line. Four plays later, freshman running back Harvey Unga bulled into the endzone to win it 17‚Äì10. Austin Collie, who caught the Max Hall pass to convert the 4th and 18 to a first down said about the play, \\"I wouldn't say it was lucky. We executed the play well. We should have had another one. Obviously, when you're doing what's right on and off the field, I think the Lord steps in and plays a part in it. Magic happens.\\" The comment further fueled the religious animosity between the two teams. BCS busting... again Only four years removed from shocking the college football world in 2004 and becoming the first team from outside the BCS to bust into the BCS, Utah returned to the national stage by going undefeated throughout the year. The game was fairly even until Utah scored a touchdown with 15 seconds left in the half to put the Utes up by 10. In the second half, BYU cut the lead to three by the end of the third quarter but couldn't keep Utah out of the endzone in the fourth quarter. Utah would score three times in the final quarter to win 48‚Äì24. Second overtime game BYU fans storm the field after the overtime win of the Cougars in the 2009 game In 2009, in the second overtime game in series history, BYU defeated Utah 26‚Äì23. BYU held a 20‚Äì6 lead entering the fourth quarter. Utah scored 14 fourth-quarter points to force overtime, but their comeback fell short. Utah managed a field goal in overtime to take a 23‚Äì20 lead, but on BYU's possession, Max Hall connected to tight end Andrew George for a 25-yard touchdown reception and the victory. The game was dubbed \\"George is still running\\" by BYU fans. During the postgame press conference, Hall was asked if he felt he had redeemed himself for his performance in the previous year's game in which he had five interceptions and one fumble. Hall responded, \\"A little bit, yeah. I don't like Utah. In fact, I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate their program. I hate their fans. I hate everything. So, it feels good to send those guys home. They didn't deserve it. It was our time and it was our time to win. We deserved it. We played as hard as we could tonight, and it felt really good to send them home and to get them out of here, so it is a game I'll always remember.\\" When asked for a clarification and whether he really hated Utah, Hall said, \\"I think the whole university and their fans and organization is classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year, and did a whole bunch of nasty things. I don't respect them, and they deserve to lose.\\" The next day, Hall issued an apology for his \\"remarks\\". He alleged that his \\"family was spit on, had beer dumped on them and were physically assaulted on several occasions\\" during the previous year's game at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Hall had made similar accusations following a loss to the University of Arizona, during his time at Arizona State. Burton's block For 2010, the game was played at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City. It was the last game for the two teams as conference rivals. BYU entered the game with a 6‚Äì5 while Utah came in at 9‚Äì2. In a low scoring affair, BYU scored two field goals, one in each of the first two quarters, to lead 6‚Äì0 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Cougars got a touchdown on a 21-yard pass play from Jake Heaps to McKay Jacobson, to take a 13‚Äì0 lead. The fourth quarter began with Utah scoring a 40-yard field goal, cutting the lead to 13‚Äì3, and then after Utah recovered a BYU fumble, Utah capitalized with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Jordan Wynn to DeVonte Christopher to make the score 13‚Äì10. The Cougars responded with a field goal, to make it 16‚Äì10. Utah responded to a series of turnovers with a Matt Asiata touchdown on a 3-yard run to make it 17‚Äì16 with 4:24 remaining. BYU then drove down the field to Utah's 22-yard line, to set up Mitch Payne for a game- winning field goal with 4 seconds remaining. However, Utah cornerback Brandon Burton raced from the outside to block the kick and secure a 17‚Äì16 Utah victory. Shock and Awe With Utah having left for the Pac-12 and BYU declaring conference independence, the 2011 BYU home game against Utah was the rivalry's first non-conference game since 1898. BYU suffered a rough start on its opening drive, when on its third play, the ball was snapped over quarterback Jake Heaps' head and recovered for a touchdown by Utah DE Derrick Shelby. The remainder of the 1st quarter held similar luck for BYU, with Running back JJ Di'Luigi being stripped of the ball on 1st and Goal from the Utah 6-yard line. The 2nd quarter proved more competitive with BYU completing a 32-yard TD pass to WR Ross Apo. Utah answered with 30-yard TD pass from QB Jordan Wynn to freshman TE Jake Murphy, just two minutes before the half. Utah led at halftime 14‚Äì10. After a first half that seemed to promise the typical nail-biter game that the last decade of the rivalry had shown, it was anything but. The Utes scored 40 unanswered points in the 2nd half (a total of 47 unanswered). Turnovers continued to plague BYU, who would finish with 7, including JD Falslev's mishandled kickoff return at their own 6-yard line, QB Jake Heaps fumble at their own 6-yard line, and QB Riley Nelson's (substituted in for Heaps in the 4th quarter) fumble after being sacked, returned 57 yards for a TD by freshman LB V.J. Fehoko. The final result of 54‚Äì10 was the largest margin of victory for either team in the Holy War since 1983, and Utah's second-largest margin of victory ever in the Holy War. Utah's 54 points were the second most the Utes had ever scored against BYU. Fandemonium In 2012, the Holy War ended in dramatic and odd fashion. Utah went into the 4th quarter up 17 points, but the BYU offense brought the game within 3. With less than 30 seconds remaining, BYU quarterback Riley Nelson successfully drove into Utah territory on 4th and long with a 40-yard pass to wide receiver, Cody Hoffman. On what was thought to be the final play of the game, Nelson's deflected pass fell incomplete as time seemingly expired and the Utah fans rushed the field. The pass, however, was shown to hit the ground with one second left, giving BYU an opportunity to kick a field goal from 51 yards (once the fans had been cleared from the field of play). On the attempt, the kick was blocked, the ball recovered by BYU, and the runner subsequently tackled. However, Utah fans again rushed the field, this time before the play was over, thus earning a penalty that gave BYU another chance at a field goal, this one from 36 yards. That attempt was unsuccessful, however, when the kick hit the left upright and went awry, leading Utah fans, who were already on the sidelines, to rush the field for a third and final time. Utah won the game 24‚Äì21. Twenty to Thirteen in 2013 Utah and BYU played the 2013 game under the request of Utah Athletic Director Chris Hill that it would be the final contest until 2016 ‚Äì a fact that served as motivation for both teams to avoid having to endure a defeat for three years. Utah found themselves with a 13‚Äì0 halftime lead at LaVell Edwards Stadium. BYU scored on their first drive of the 2nd half, a field goal, with 11:39 remaining in the third quarter and the Cougars tacked on another exactly six minutes later. Utah, though, responded with a 79-yard touchdown drive to extend its lead to 20‚Äì6 with 12:44 remaining in regulation. BYU fought back for their 3rd score of the half, this time on a one-yard run by running back Michael Alisa, with 5:44 left in the game to close the gap to seven points. After the Cougar defense forced the Utes to a three-and-out on Utah's next possession, BYU quarterback Taysom Hill was intercepted on the Cougars' next drive with a little more than 90 seconds remaining ‚Äì appearing to seal the win for Utah. The Utes would leave Provo with a 20‚Äì13 win. 2015 Las Vegas Bowl: Holy War in Sin City The planned hiatus for 2014‚Äì2015 was unexpectedly cut short. On December 6, 2015, it was announced that BYU would play Utah on December 19, 2015 in the Las Vegas Bowl. It was the first time the teams met in the postseason and the first Holy War game to be played at a neutral site. During the first 8 minutes of the game, Utah forced a Las Vegas Bowl record five turnovers in the first quarter, resulting in a 35‚Äì0 lead. Though BYU would score four unanswered touchdowns to narrow the lead to 35‚Äì28, Utah was able to secure a crucial first down at the end of the game to run out the clock. After the first five minutes of the game, BYU never possessed the ball with a chance to tie or take the lead in the game. Utah took the bowl game with a 35‚Äì28 win, ending Bronco Mendenhall's last game as BYU's head coach with a loss. =2016‚Äìpresent: Whittingham versus SitakeHindsight is 20‚Äì20 The first BYU offensive play from scrimmage in the 2016 game resulted in an interception, returned by Sunia Tauteoli for a 41-yard Utah pick-six. However, Utah subsequently committed several turnovers, which would lead to two BYU field goals and a touchdown late in the 2nd Quarter. Utah answered with a touchdown of their own and held a slim 14‚Äì13 lead as the teams headed into the locker room for halftime. After adding a field goal in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter, Utah led 20‚Äì13 with 2:47 to go. Taysom Hill led BYU on 75-yard drive, capped off by a 7-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds to play. Rather than kick the PAT to make it 20‚Äì20, BYU Head Coach Kalani Sitake decided to go for the two-point conversion and the win. Quarterback Taysom Hill ran the ball up the middle on a draw, but the Utes stopped him at the three-yard line. Utah would emerge victorious by a score of 20‚Äì19, despite committing six turnovers in the game. The Tyler Huntley Show In the 2017 matchup, Utah quarterback Tyler Huntley racked up a career-high 300 passing yards (27-of-36), and added a career-high 89 yards on the ground and a touchdown. The Utes held a 13-point lead to end the third quarter, but a late fourth quarter touchdown from BYU made it a six-point game, putting the pressure on the Utes' defense. They didn't disappoint, forcing three incomplete passes to regain possession and claim the victory. Utah would win the game, 19‚Äì13.https://utahutes.com/news/2017/9/10/football-utah-beats- byu-19-13.aspx The Comeback The game on November 24, 2018 was held in Salt Lake City at Rice-Eccles Stadium. BYU (6‚Äì5) was the underdog to the Pac-12 South Champion Utah Utes (8‚Äì3). BYU jumped on the Utes, scoring 20 unanswered points. Utah's first score came early in the third quarter from an interception returned for a touchdown. BYU led 27‚Äì7 up until 40 seconds remained in the third quarter. After a Utah touchdown, the resulting momentum shift led to two touchdown runs by Armand Shyne, which gave Utah the lead for the first time with just 3:02 left in regulation. Utah, up by 1 point (28‚Äì27), then forced BYU to turn the ball over on downs with an impressive 4th & 1 stop. On the first play of the ensuing drive, with 1:43 left in the game, Utah quarterback Jason Shelley ran 33 yards for a touchdown to bring the score to 35‚Äì27.https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2018/11/25/after-near-perfect-first/ This was the largest deficit overcome for either team in the Holy War series.https://utahutes.com/news/2018/11/25/football-postgame-notes-vs- byu.aspx Moss Brings the Lightning The 100th meeting between the two schools saw Utah winning their 4th straight game at LaVell Edwards Stadium with the help of senior running back Zack Moss, who rushed for 187 yards and scored a touchdown. Up 9‚Äì6 at halftime, Utah scored 21 unanswered points after the break to seize control before the Cougars stopped the bleeding with a touchdown in the fourth quarter. The game went into a 54-minute weather delay with 9:01 remaining, with the game resuming after midnight. This came after Utah scored a pair of touchdowns early in the fourth quarter to build a 30‚Äì6 lead. Both Utes touchdowns were a result of BYU turnovers, as Zack Moss scored on a 12-yard run following a Cougar fumble and Julian Blackmon scored on a 39-yard pick-six on the next BYU drive, just 31 seconds later. Utah would win the game, 30‚Äì12, and extend their winning streak over BYU to 9 games.https://www.deseret.com/2019/8/29/20839894/live-coverage-byu-cougars- host-no-14-utah-utes-in-season-opening-rivalry-contest Future games Because of the Pac-12 Conference's decision to restrict member schools to conference play only due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 BYU‚ÄìUtah game was canceled in July. The series will continue through 2021, after which a 2-year hiatus will take place. The series will then resume until at least 2028.

Plot Laurie Harding (Paulo Costanzo) is a small shop clerk in the local Calgary mall. His world is full of tragic accidents - crosswalks, elevators, escalators and virtually anything associated with commercialism or technology is parodied as objects of fear and tragedy. An elevator plunges 30 stories. A woman's scarf is caught in an escalator, strangling her to death. A man is struck by a car, right before Laurie had the premonition to not cross. His own world is full of fear of these very events, his predictions of them, and his dependence on his less-than-sympathetic sister, Michelle (Camille Sullivan). Michelle heads product development at the company Global Safety Inc., whose mission is to provide products to combat the \\"Fear Storm\\" which assails the city. With their \\"Early Warning 2 Safe System tm\\", the PDA-like device warns you of danger ahead of time and the \\"Safe Bracelet tm\\" senses your fear and allows you to beep for help. Along with Laurie's prophetic powers, and the endless onslaught of accidents, the movie is full of absurd events: a mall announcer who continually requests a speaker of x foreign language - without any apparent reason; the same mall's population which slowly dwindles, being virtually empty by the film's end; an entire classroom population which is accosted simultaneously by hiccups; Some of these are more apparently satirical of pop culture: to comfort himself, Laurie repeats commercial refrains, such \\"Rice-A- Roni, the San Francisco treat\\"; his girlfriend, Dot (Emily Hampshire), does a survey on \\"how the clothes you wear define you\\" - one she both detests and is obsessed by. These events are framed by the pretextual plot of Laurie conquering his fears -- and by extension, the fears of those around him. However, by the film's end, it is doubtful that anything has been changed or achieved.

Los Herreras is at 281 meters above sea level and is located in the east-central part of the state. Its coordinates are 25¬∫53' N and 99¬∫33' W. History The foundation of this village goes back to the middle of the 17th century and originally it was called 'Rancho de la Manteca'-Spanish for Lard Ranch. Don Juan de Zavala was given a land grant for its foundation by the governor, Don Mart√≠n de Zavala. Juan de Zavala and inhabitants from Cadereyta began the foundation The haciendas of San Vicente, Guadalupe and San Agust√≠n, which are all under the jurisdiction of the modern municipality of Los Herreras, were all older foundations with larger populations than Rancho de la Manteca. However, this last one was chosen as the head of the municipality for its closeness to the railroad line that went between Monterrey and Matamoros. Rancho de la Manteca was elevated to the status of township (\\"Villa\\") by a state congressional decree on November 20, 1874 which was signed into law governor Don Ram√≥n Trevi√±o on December 9, 1874 At its elevation to township status, the name of the municipality was changed to Los Herreras. The most commonly accepted reason for the selection of this name is that it was to honor the brothers Herrera heroes of the battle of San Bernabe during Mexico's fight for independence from Spain. Climate The climate is an arid dry steppe, with very high temperatures in the summer and very little rainfall. The average annual temperature is 24¬∞C and average annual precipitation is 500 mm. May and September are the rainiest months. Predominant winds are from the east. Population According to the 1990 federal census, the municipality had a population of 3,363 -a density of 7.68/km¬≤. 69.91% of the population lived in the municipal seat. The census total showed that 1,705 inhabitants were male and 1,658 female. The 2000 federal census showed a population decline compared to the previous count, with a total of 2,795 inhabitants, of which 50.8% were male and 49.2% female. The population, like most of the northern part of the state, is predominantly of European or \\"White\\" descent, most of which are concentrated in the communities of San Agustin, San Vicente, La Laja and La Hacienda de Guadalupe. Population Centers The municipality has 21 population centers, among the principal ones are: *Los Herreras. Main population center and seat of government. *San Vicente. Second largest population center. *San Agustin. Third largest population center. *San Jose de La Laja. Fourth largest population center *Barretosa.

He played Major League baseball in parts of two seasons-1905 and 1910. Sharpe was born on August 6, 1881 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, and his height and weight are unknown. Sharpe chose to attend Penn State University. On April 14, 1905, at the age of 23, Sharpe made his big league debut with the Boston Beaneaters. In 46 games that year, he batted .182 in 170 at-bats. The next chance Sharpe got to play in the big leagues was with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1910. He played only four games with them that year before being traded to the Boston Doves on April 28 with Sam Frock for Kirby White. With both teams in 1910, Sharpe hit a combined .237 in 119 games. On the diamond, Sharpe committed 23 career errors for a .983 fielding percentage. Sharpe played his final big league game on September 24, 1910. He died from a heart attack on May 31, 1916 in Haddock, Georgia at the age of 34. His body was buried in Greenmount Cemetery in the place of his birth, West Chester, Pennsylvania. Sharpe was also a noted soccer player, spending time with a local team in West Chester during the baseball off-seasons.October 3, 1908 Sporting Times Sources References  Category:Boston Beaneaters players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Boston Doves players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:People from West Chester, Pennsylvania Category:1881 births Category:1916 deaths Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:Penn State Nittany Lions baseball players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Scranton Miners players Category:Newark Sailors players Category:Newark Indians players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Oakland Oaks (baseball) players Category:Oakland Oaks (baseball) managers Category:American soccer players Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Sportspeople from Chester County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Bud Sharpe"},{"id":"4450582","text":"The Cuban League was one of the earliest and longest lasting professional baseball leagues outside the United States, operating in Cuba from 1878 to 1961. The schedule usually operated during the winter months, so the league was sometimes known as the \\"Cuban Winter League.\\" It was always a small league, generally 3 to 5 teams, and was centered in Havana, though it sometimes included teams from outlying cities such as Matanzas or Santa Clara. The league became racially integrated in 1900, and during the first half of the 20th century the Cuban League was a premier venue for black and white players to meet. Many great black Northern American players competed in Cuba alongside native black and white Cuban stars such as Jos√© M√©ndez, Crist√≥bal Torriente, Adolfo Luque, and Mart√≠n Dihigo. After 1947, the Cuban League entered into an agreement with Major League Baseball and was used for player development. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, however, tensions rose with the new Communist government, and in March 1961 the government decreed the abolition of professional baseball. Early history: 1878‚Äì1899 1889 Club Cardenas The first game in what became known as the Cuban League took place in Havana on December 29, 1878. Esteban Bell√°n, the first Latin American to play professionally in the United States, was captain (playing manager) of Habana while the opposing Almendares was captained by Carlos Zaldo. (Almendares was a suburb just outside old Havana.) Habana won the first game 21-20. The only other team in the league was Matanzas. In that first season, only four games were scheduled for each team, with the season lasting through February. Habana won the first championship with a record of 4-0-1.Figueredo, pp. 5‚Äì7. Early baseball in Cuba, as in the United States, was an amateur sport first organized by gentlemen's athletic clubs. Games were played on Sundays and were typically preceded by a picnic and followed by a dance.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 85‚Äì89. A unique feature of early Cuban baseball is that teams played with 10 players per side. The tenth player was a \\"right shortstop\\", playing halfway between the first and second bases.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 103‚Äì104. By the mid-1880s, the best-known players were becoming celebrities and baseball began to become professional, as players jumped from team to team and Americans were sometimes brought in as reinforcements. The gradual development of professionalism that took place in Cuba during the 1880s and 1890s echoed the development of professionalism in the United States two decades earlier in the National Association of Base Ball Players, which ultimately led to the formation of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. In Cuba, however, the clubs that wished to remain amateur broke off from the Cuban League.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 99‚Äì103, 116‚Äì119, 207‚Äì208. Baseball in Cuba became associated with Cuban identity and nationalism. Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a notes, \\"Baseball was a sport played in defiance of Spanish authorities, who viewed this American invention as vaguely secessionist and dangerously violent because of the use of sticks. A ban was issued in 1869, just as the Ten Years' War was starting.\\"Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 89‚Äì90. Several of the sponsors of early baseball teams were also supporters of the revolutionary cause. A number of ballplayers fought against Spain in the Cuban War of Independence (1895‚Äì98), and at least three lost their lives: Emilio Sabour√≠n, Juan Manuel Pastoriza, and Ricardo Cabaleiro.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 73, 83‚Äì84, 88‚Äì89; Figueredo, p. 33. During the 19th century the Cuban League remained a segregated, whites-only institution. However, black Cubans were developing their baseball skills playing for semi-professional and sugarmill teams. The Cuban War of Independence brought Cuban blacks and whites together in a common cause and created the pressures that ultimately brought integration.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 102‚Äì103, 116‚Äì122. The other great legacy of 19th century Cuban League baseball was the enduring rivalry between Habana and Almendares. This rivalry began before the formation of the Cuban League and survived after its end, lasting for nearly a century. Growing up in Havana (and, indeed, in much of Cuba) meant choosing between Habana and Almendares.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 18‚Äì19, 110, 125. Highlights *On December 29, 1878 the Cuban League's first game took place in Havana; Habana beat Almendares 21-20.Figueredo, pp. 5‚Äì6. *On December 21, 1879 an American professional team, the \\"Hop Bitters\\", visited Cuba and easily beat a Cuban team. The team's players comprised the Worcester team that had played in the minor league National Association in 1879 and would play in the major National League in 1880‚Äì1882. This tour began a long tradition of post-season exhibition series between major leaguers and Cuban teams.Figueredo, p. 7. *In 1881 the first Almendares Park opened. For several decades it served as the principal Havana home for Cuban League baseball. *On February 2, 1886, Carlos Maci√° pitched a shutout for Almendares, the first in Cuban League history, beating Fe 16 to 0.Figueredo, p. 12. *In 1887 Habana won its sixth consecutive pennant. In the nine years since the founding of the Cuban League, Habana had so far been the only winner. (There had been two years when the league did not play; in a third year, disputes led to the termination of the season with no official winner.)Figueredo, pp. 5‚Äì14. *In 1888 Fe became the first team other than Habana to win a championship. Antonio Mar√≠a Garc√≠a, known as El Ingl√©s (the Englishman), wins the first of 4 batting championships, hitting .448 for Habana.Figueredo, pp. 16‚Äì17. *In 1889 Wenceslao G√°lvez writes the first history of baseball in Cuba (and one of the first for any country), El base- ball en Cuba.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 77, 84. *On May 17, 1890 the President of the league, Oscar Mart√≠nez Conill, was killed in a fire while serving in a volunteer fire-fighting brigade.Figueredo, p. 20. *In 1891, Alfred Lawson led two American teams on tours of Cuba. The first team to tour, in January and February, featured a mix of major and minor leaguers. It beat Matanzas, Progreso, and Almendares, but lost to Habana, Fe, and an all-star team known as the All-Cubans. The second team, the \\"All Americans\\", came in December and comprised major-league players including young stars like Bill Dahlen and John McGraw. This team easily beat the Cubans in five straight games with scores of 17-0, 14-0, 11-4, 14-3, and 10-1. For the second tour, Cuban player Antonio Mar√≠a Garc√≠a was lent to the All Americans and led all hitters in the series, prompting an offer from McGraw to sign with the Baltimore Orioles; Garc√≠a turned down the offer because he was paid more in Cuba.Figueredo, pp. 9, 25‚Äì26; Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, p. 100; *In 1894 Almendares finally won its first championship, led by the pitching of Juan Manuel Pastoriza.Figueredo, p. 30. *In 1895‚Äì96 and 1896‚Äì97, baseball was not played due to the Cuban War of Independence. In 1897 Emilio Sabour√≠n, who played for Habana in its inaugural season and went on to become its manager, died in a Spanish prison after being captured during the war. In 1897‚Äì98 the Spanish government allowed baseball to be played even though the revolution continued in the countryside; the season was ended early, however, when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out.Figueredo, pp. 33‚Äì34. * In February 1899, the Cuban League returned under American occupation.Figueredo, pp. 34‚Äì35. Golden Age: 1900‚Äì1933 The 1910‚Äì11 Habana team's players including John Henry (\\"Sam\\") Lloyd, Preston (\\"Pete\\") Hill, and Grant (\\"Home Run\\") Johnson The year 1900 brought fundamental change to the Cuban League. In the aftermath of the Cuban War of Independence and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, pressures mounted for racial integration of the league. Led by promoters and entrepreneurs such as Abel Linares and Tinti Molina, the league integrated in 1900 with the admission of an all-black club, San Francisco, and the admission of non-white players to some of the other clubs. When San Francisco easily took the pennant, the other clubs quickly began bidding for the top black players. These changes also marked the recognition of the league's status as a fully professional institution.Figueredo, pp. 37‚Äì41; Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 116‚Äì123. These changes did not occur without opposition and controversy. At least one team owner sold his interest rather than invest in an integrated enterprise. Several of the players from the upper classes moved to amateur leagues, which continued to compete behind walls of racial segregation.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 115, 118‚Äì119, 189‚Äì192, 207‚Äì208. The next major change came in 1907 when the Fe team began loading up with black American stars, such as Rube Foster, Home Run Johnson, Pete Hill, and Bill Monroe. Soon the other teams were also bringing in the Negro League stars, culminating in the 1912 Habana, which easily took the title with a team featuring Hall-of-Famers Joe Williams, John Henry Lloyd, and Pete Hill, as well as Home Run Johnson and Cuban stars Juli√°n Castillo, Carlos Mor√°n, and Luis Padr√≥n. According to Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, \\"These teams were clearly of major-league quality, combining the cream of Negro baseball with the best Cuba had to offer, and a few white major leaguers to boot.\\" Only Almendares was able to remain competitive for a while without American reinforcements, relying on its strong core of Cuban-born pitchers including Hall-of-Famer Jos√© M√©ndez, Eustaquio Pedroso, and Jos√© Mu√±oz.Figueredo, pp. 66‚Äì110; Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, pp. 126‚Äì128, 142. As the Cuban League strengthened, it began doing much better in its now regular competitions against major league teams. In 1908 M√©ndez blanked the Cincinnati Reds for 25 consecutive innings, including a 1-hit, 9-strikeout shutout. In 1910 the Cuban teams beat the World Series champion Philadelphia Athletics 6 games to 4, leading the embarrassed Commissioner to issue a ban on post-season exhibition games by the reigning World Series champion. During the 1910s a number of white Cuban players began to break into major league ranks, including the outstanding Cincinnati Reds pitcher Dolf Luque, catcher Mike Gonz√°lez, and outfielder Armando Marsans. Black Cuban players competed regularly in the Negro Leagues, where Crist√≥bal Torriente and Jos√© M√©ndez became stars. During the 1920s the Cuban League reached its apex in quality, as top Negro League stars such as Oscar Charleston, Jud Wilson, John Henry Lloyd, Cool Papa Bell, Mule Suttles, Satchel Paige, Bill Foster, and Willie Wells played alongside great Cuban stars such as Mart√≠n Dihigo, Crist√≥bal Torriente, Alejandro Oms, Bernardo Bar√≥, Dolf Luque, and Manuel Cueto. Researchers have estimated that for several seasons the quality of play in the Cuban League probably equaled that of the major leagues. Highlights *In 1902 Habana swept the competition, ending the season with a record of 17-0. Pitcher Carlos (Beb√©) Royer pitched every game, also ending with a record of 17-0. *In 1903 Habana won the title over Fe in the bottom of the 9th inning of the last game of a 5-game playoff series. Habana's Carlos Royer went 18-10. *In 1908, the major league Cincinnati Reds played Cuban League teams in Cuba in the American Series. Cincinnati beat Habana 5‚Äì1, but fell 1‚Äì5‚Äì1 to Almendares, as Jos√© M√©ndez pitched 25 shutout innings. Cuban League teams would play against major league teams in the American Series until 1953.Figueredo, pp. 376‚Äì377. *In 1909 Eustaquio Pedroso pitched an 11-inning no-hitter to beat the American League pennant-winning Detroit Tigers. The Cuban teams beat the Tigers (who were without the services of Ty Cobb) 8 games to 4. *In 1918 a new Havana stadium, the second Almendares Park, opened a few blocks away from the old one, which was last used in 1916. *In 1920 Babe Ruth accompanied the New York Giants to Cuba. Cuban slugger Crist√≥bal Torriente upstaged the Bambino by blasting 3 home runs in one game. *Considered the most dominant team in Cuban League history, the Santa Clara Leopards towered over the league with a record of 36-11. The team featured batting champion Oliver Marcelle, shortstop Dobie Moore who led in hits and triples, outfield great Oscar Charleston who led in runs and stolen bases, and Bill Holland who led in pitching with a record of 10-2. Alejandro Oms, Rube Currie, Dave Brown, Jos√© M√©ndez, Frank Duncan, Frank Warfield, and Pablo Mesa rounded out Cuba's version of the 1927 Yankees. *In 1926‚Äì27 a rival league, \\"Triangular\\", was formed which raided many of the best players. *In 1927‚Äì28 Jud Wilson won the batting title with a .424 average, while also leading the league in triples with 7. Wilson and Mart√≠n Dihigo led Habana to a runaway title. *On January 1, 1929 Cool Papa Bell brought in the new year by hitting 3 inside-the-park home runs in one game. That season Alejandro Oms set the all-time single-season batting record by hitting .432. *In October 1930 marked the opening of a new ballpark, La Tropical Stadium, which replaced the second Almendares Park. *In 1932‚Äì33, Habana and Almendares ended the season in a tie. With an unstable political situation, plans for a playoff were scuttled and no winner was declared. For the second season in a row, no American players were brought in, reflecting Cuba's poor economic situation. Adjusting to change: 1934‚Äì1961 Following the death in 1930 of Cuban League owner Abel Linares, the economic depression of the early 1930s, and the 1933 political uprising that overthrew President Gerardo Machado, the Cuban League found itself in difficult circumstances. The 1933‚Äì34 season was cancelled, and when it returned the following season it was without American players or some of the biggest Cuban-born stars, such as Mart√≠n Dihigo. Gradually, though, the league regained its strength and before the 1930s had ended, the league had enjoyed dramatic play from Dihigo, Josh Gibson, Willie Wells, Ray Brown, Roberto (Bobby) Estalella, L√°zaro Salazar, Alejandro Carrasquel, Ray Dandridge, and Sam Bankhead. During World War II, travel restrictions cut off most of the supply of U.S. players. However, Cuba's own talent flourished as players such as Manuel (Coca√≠na) Garcia, Alejandro Crespo, Silvio Garc√≠a, and Claro Duany starred. After the war, attendance flourished as several exciting pennant races took place, especially the 1946‚Äì47 campaign, which many consider to be the greatest pennant race in Cuban League history. American players, such as Dick Sisler, Lou Klein, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie, returned to Cuba and participated alongside new Cuban stars such as Orestes (Minnie) Mi√±oso, Connie Marrero, Julio Moreno, and Sandalio (Sandy) Consuegra. In 1946 a modern, new stadium opened in Havana, Gran Stadium (now known as Latin American Stadium), with a capacity for 35,000 spectators. In the aftermath of the Mexican League's efforts in 1945 to sign major league players, U.S. organized baseball engaged in an effort to control the flow of players in Cuba and the other Caribbean leagues. This effort culminated in a 1947 agreement between the Cuban League and the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues to bring top minor league and new major league players to Cuba for winter league play. The next season a second league‚Äîthe Players' Federation‚Äîwas formed, consisting largely of players who were outlawed by organized baseball for their play in the Mexican League. This new league, however, proved not to be viable and lasted only one season. Throughout the 1950s baseball flourished under the new arrangements. Cuba performed very well in the annual Caribbean Series, and also fielded a summer team, the Havana Sugar Kings, at first in the Florida International League, and later in the International League. Stars of the 1950s included Minnie Mi√±oso, Pedro Formental, Rocky Nelson, Camilo Pascual, Sandy Amor√≥s, and Pedro Ramos. However, with the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the days of professional baseball in Cuba were numbered. In March 1961, one month after the end of the 1960‚Äì61 Cuban League season, the government decreed the abolition of professional baseball. Many of the professional players became exiles in the United States or other Latin American countries. In Cuba baseball lived on in the form of an amateur Cuban national baseball system including the Cuban National Series, as the government reformed the system to focus on national goals. Highlights *In 1935‚Äì36 Mart√≠n Dihigo dominated the league as perhaps no other player in history; he led the league in pitching (11-2) as well as in most of the hitting categories: average (.358), runs (42), hits (63), triples (8), and RBI (38), while leading Santa Clara to the pennant. *In 1936‚Äì37 Ray Brown had a magnificent season, going 21-4 for a Santa Clara team that was 16-28 with its other pitchers. In a 3-game playoff, Brown beat Mart√≠n Dihigo of Marianao 6 to 1 in the first game, but Silvio Garc√≠a won the second game for Santa Clara. In the concluding game Dihigo came back with two days' rest to beat the Santa Clara Leopards 7 to 3. *In 1938‚Äì39 Josh Gibson shattered the old home run record of 7 (set by Mule Suttles) by slugging 11 in 163 at-bats. (Home runs had always been scarce in Cuban baseball due to the expansive size of the playing fields. For example, the dimensions of La Tropical Stadium are listed as 398 feet down the right field line, 498 feet down the left field line, and 505 feet to straight center field.) *In 1941‚Äì42 Ram√≥n Braga√±a set a record for most consecutive scoreless innings with 39-2/3, while leading Almendares to a pennant in a tight race against Habana. *In 1945‚Äì46 Dick Sisler led the league with 9 home runs, including 3 homers in one game. Minnie Mi√±oso won the Rookie of the Year award. *1946‚Äì47 was the most famous pennant race in Cuban League history. During the last month Almendares began making up a 6-game deficit to Habana. On February 23, 1947 Habana had a 1¬Ω game lead over Almendares with a 3-game series remaining between the rivals‚ÄîAlmendares would need to win all 3 to win. In the first game Max Lanier of Almendares won a 4 to 2 decision over Habana. The next day, Agapito Mayor of Almendares beat Fred Martin of Habana 2 to 1 when Andr√©s Fleitas tripled to knock in the winning run in the seventh inning. The following day Almendares manager Dolf Luque decided to use Max Lanier on 1 day's rest, and Lanier pitched a complete-game 9 to 2 victory to seal the pennant. *In 1952‚Äì53 Lou Klein set the all-time home run record with 16. *In 1955‚Äì56 Camilo Pascual led Cienfuegos to the pennant with a 12-5 record and 1.91 earned run average. *In 1956‚Äì57 Minnie Mi√±oso led Marianao to the pennant while winning the batting championship with a .312 average. *The fall of Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959 to the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro led to the temporary suspension of play until January 6, but eventually all of the scheduled games were made up. *As relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated, American players stayed at home during the 1960‚Äì61 season. Pedro Ramos led Cienfuegos to the Cuban League's final pennant. Luis Tiant, Jr. went 10-8 to win the Rookie of the Year award. One month after the end of the season, professional baseball was abolished, to be replaced by the amateur Cuban national baseball system.

WJOX is the Birmingham affiliate of the UAB Blazers Radio Network (baseball only), Tennessee Titans Radio, the Atlanta Braves and Fox Sports Radio. It used to be the broadcast home of the Birmingham Barons. The station has studios in Homewood and its transmitter is in Midfield. It is Alabama's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. History The station that now broadcasts from 690 AM in Birmingham signed on in 1947 as WVOK. It was the first radio station in Birmingham to broadcast with 50,000 watts. Due to Federal Communications Commission restrictions, the station broadcast only during daytime hours. It was not until the early 1980s that WVOK was able to broadcast 24 hours a day. 690 AM is a Canadian and Mexican clear-channel frequency. Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, WVOK was a Top 40 station calling itself ‚ÄúThe Mighty 690\\" with a signal that covered almost all of north and central Alabama, as well as parts of Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee. Rather than attempting to compete with crosstown station (and market leader) WSGN, WVOK targeted listeners in the rural areas of the states its signal reached. One of the most popular promotions of WVOK was their ‚ÄúShower of Stars‚Äù concert series. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these concerts brought such performers as the Rolling Stones, Jerry Lee Lewis, Neil Diamond and the Beach Boys to Birmingham. In 1976, WVOK dropped Top 40 music and became a country station using the nickname OK 69. At about the same time, sister station WVOK-FM (now WZRR) signed on with an album rock format. Country music on WVOK continued until 1985, when the station changed to adult contemporary music before moving to an oldies format. In 1989, oldies were dropped, and the station began playing classic country music. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, several AM stations in Birmingham debuted afternoon sports talk call-in shows. Local sportswriter Paul Finebaum had debuted a popular show on WAPI. In 1990, Herb Winches, a former TV sports anchor on WBRC and WVTM, moved his own popular show with co-host Ben Cook from WERC to WVOK. Because Winches‚Äô show was fairly successful, and because, by the 1990s, there were few AM radio stations that were successful playing music, station management made the decision to launch an all-sports station in 1992. On November 29, 2006, WJOX began simulcasting on the 100.5 FM frequency of sister station WRAX. On December 1, the AM station changed its call letters to WSPZ, and the WJOX call sign moved to the FM station. On January 8, 2007, WJOX-FM and WSPZ began separate sports programming schedules. Three of the local call- in shows from the former WJOX moved to FM, and a new morning-drive show was created, reuniting former WJOX morning drive personalities Matt Coulter and Scott Griffin. As a result of the change, and to differentiate itself from WJOX, an affiliate of ESPN Radio, WSPZ affiliated with Fox Sports Radio. Coulter was let go by WSPZ on January 22, 2008 when his contract was not renewed. Scott Griffin was fired on July 17, 2008 and his show was replaced with syndicated sports talk, then Don Imus's nationally syndicated morning show.

Ahrens (1919‚Äì1942), who was killed during the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu‚ÄìTanambogo on 8 August 1942. He was posthumously awarded a Navy Cross. Ahrens was laid down on 5 November 1943 at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation; launched on 21 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Marie Ahrens, the mother of Private First Class Ahrens; and commissioned on 12 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander Morgan H. Hains in command. Service history Late in February 1944, Ahrens proceeded to Bermuda for shakedown training. In early April, she sailed to Casco Bay, Maine, for additional training. On 22 April at Norfolk, Virginia, the destroyer escort joined Task Group (TG) 21.11, a hunter/killer group ‚Äî built around the escort carrier ‚Äî which was operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean. On 29 May, the torpedoed and sank Block Island and . Ahrens rescued 673 survivors in a period of 40 minutes. While carrying out rescue operations, the ship assisted the destroyer escort in locating the submarine. Eugene E. Elmore made two hedgehog attacks which sank the German submarine. Following repairs at the New York Navy Yard, the destroyer escort carried out training exercises at Casco Bay and Norfolk, Virginia. On 23 July, Ahrens assumed duty as an escort for transatlantic convoys. The highlight of this period came on 13 October after a merchant ship collided with a gasoline tanker, starting large fires on both ships. Following her rescue of survivors, Ahrens and USS Holton (DE-703) succeeded in putting out the fires. On 15 December, Ahrens sailed with TG 27.7 to join the 7th Fleet in the Pacific. She proceeded to Manus, Admiralty Islands, via the Panama Canal. On 23 January 1945, the destroyer escort touched at Manus. She continued on to Leyte, Philippines, arriving there on 9 February. The vessel was then attached to TG 75.2 to serve as an ocean escort for the Philippine Sea Frontier. Ahrens escorted merchant and naval convoys until 25 August 1945, During this period, she operated between such points as Hollandia, New Guinea; Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines; Kossol Roads, Palau Islands; Ulithi; and Okinawa. In late August 1945, Ahrens was detached from the Philippine Sea Frontier and began supporting occupation forces operating in China and Korea, visiting Jinsen, Korea; Chinwangtao, China; and Hong Kong. The ship began her long voyage back to the United States on 5 November and stopped at Pearl Harbor; San Diego; and the Panama Canal Zone before finally reaching Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 December. She then commenced pre- inactivation overhaul and sailed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, in early 1946. Ahrens was decommissioned there on 24 June 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1965. Awards Ahrens won two battle stars for her World War II service.

The term \\"Seconda pratica\\" first appeared in 1603 in Giovanni Artusi's book Seconda Parte dell'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (The Second Part of The Artusi, or Imperfections of Modern Music), where it is attributed to a certain L'Ottuso Accademico. In the first part of The Artusi (1600), Artusi had severely criticized several unpublished madrigals of Claudio Monteverdi. In the second part of this work, L'Ottuso Accademico, whose identity is unknown, defends Monteverdi and others \\"who have embraced this new second practice\\".Giovanni Artusi, Seconda Parte dell'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica, p. 16, Venice (1603) Monteverdi adopted the term to distance some of his music from that of e.g. Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Gioseffo Zarlino and to describe early music of the Baroque period which encouraged more freedom from the rigorous limitations of dissonances and counterpoint characteristic of the prima pratica. Stile moderno was coined as an expression by Giulio Caccini in his 1602 work Le nuove musiche which contained numerous monodies. New for Caccini's songs were that the accompaniment was completely submissive in contrast to the lyric; hence, more precisely, Caccini's Stile moderno-monodies have ornamentations spelled out in the score, which earlier had been up to the performer to supply. Also this marks the starting point of basso continuo which also was a feature in Caccini's work. In the preface of his 5th Book of Madrigals (1605) Monteverdi announced a book of his own: Seconda pratica, overo perfettione della moderna musica. Such a book is not extant. But the preface of his 8th Book of Madrigals (1638) seems to be virtually a fragment of it. Therein Monteverdi claims to have invented a new ‚Äúagitated‚Äù style (Genere concitato, later called Stile concitato) to make the music \\"complete/perfect\\" (\\"perfetto\\").Gerald Drebes: ‚Äò‚ÄòMonteverdis Kontrastprinzip, die Vorrede zu seinem 8.

Retrieved: 2012-08-25. Origins of name The name Lacryma Christi comes from an old myth that Christ, crying over Lucifer's fall from heaven, cried his tears on the land and gave divine inspiration to the vines that grew there. The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by past lava flows, and its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages and covered with vineyards. Lacryma Christi in literature and media Lacryma Christi wine sold at a gift shop outside of Mount Vesuvius. Lacryma Christi is an old wine, frequently mentioned by poets and writers. Lacryma Christi was mentioned in the book by Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo, in W. J. Turner's poem Talking with Soldiers, in Candide by Voltaire, and by Christopher Marlowe in his play Tamburlaine the Great, Part II. The Irish periodical writer and journalist William Maginn mentions the wine amongst other spirits in his poem \\"Inishowen\\" c. 1822. In the late work of the German novelist Theodor Fontane \\"Der Stechlin\\" (1898) the wine is mentioned to be served after lunch in a convent and is characterized to be of higher grade than a Montefiascone. Hart Crane wrote a poem titled \\"Lachrymae Christi\\" included in his 1926 debut collection White Buildings. The Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch mentions the wine together with the island of Capri in his 1987 novel The Pupil. In the short story \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" collected in Mosses from an Old Manse by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a glass of lachryma is drunk by the protagonist \\"which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies\\". In the 1954 movie, Three Coins in the Fountain, Lacryma Christi is mentioned as being the favorite wine of Prince Dino di Cessi, played by actor Louis Jourdan. In The Great Warrior Skanderbeg, a Soviet-Albanian production of 1953, the wine is mentioned as a symbol of feudal luxury enjoyed by sybaritic enemies of the protagonist, the popular and prudent ruler of Albania who defeated Venice in the 1447-48 war and stalled the advance of the Ottoman Empire. When Skanderbeg's nephew, Hamza Kastrioti, joins the Ottomans against his country, a Venetian diplomat tells him that \\"gifts from Venice have arrived in Durr√´s for you: golden cups for your table, and the best wine of Venice, Lacryma Christi -- The Tears of Christ.\\" In the title story of Ray Bradbury's 1964 collection The Machineries of Joy, an Irish priest squabbles with his Italian colleague over space travel and its place in their faith; the two clerics reconcile over a bottle of Lacryma Christi while watching a televised rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.

The Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) has been based at Campbell Barracks since the Regiment was first established as an independent company in 1957. Although Campbell Barracks is the home of the SASR, most of the training and selection for the regiment takes place in Bindoon, Western Australia. The SASR is a special forces regiment of the Australian Army and is modelled on the original British SAS, while also drawing on the traditions of the Australian Z Special Force commando unit, and the Independent Companies which were active in the South Pacific during the Second World War. The SASR's three 'sabre squadrons' rotate between the war/reconnaissance and Counterterrorism/Recovery roles. Two squadrons are maintained in the war/reconnaissance role with the remaining squadron filling the Counter- Terrorism/recovery role. Rotations occur every 12 months, so each squadron fulfills the counterterrorism/recovery role and configuration every three years. Reports that the squadron filling the counterterrorism role is always designated 1 Squadron are incorrect as that practice ceased in the late 1980s. All Three Sabre Squadrons are garrisoned at Campbell Barracks save for certain units within each Sabre Squadron that can be rotated amongst bases within Australia. This usually only occurs with the current Counter Terrorist Squadron.

The power of clemency is \\"one of the most unlimited powers bestowed on the president by the Constitution.\\"  Pardoning standards  When the President proposes to exercise his or her executive clemency, the case is directed to the Office of the Pardon Attorney for review. There are five standards for someone to be considered to be pardoned. Generally, the petitioner must be in a good standing during their sentence and must wait a period of at least five years before applying to pardon. However, this five-year wait period can be waived. The first standard is how the persons conduct, character, and reputation have been during conviction. This means that the individuals conducted themselves as responsible and knowledgeable people who are aware of their crime and are ready to return to normal society. They must have the potential to create a better society by achieving employment, providing for themselves and loved ones, as well as keeping a clean criminal background. A very recent example of this would be when President Trump commuted 63 year old Alice Marie Johnson's sentence after the case was brought up by celebrity Kim Kardashian. The White House described their reasoning for the pardon by stating ‚Äúwhile this administration will always be very tough on crime, it believes that those who have paid their debt to society and worked hard to better themselves while in prison deserve a second chance\\". Second is the seriousness and when the offense occurred. When the offense is years in the past and didn't affect many people, the chance to achieve a pardon is much greater than if the offense was very recent and a high crime. Things that must be considered include how the victims would deal with the pardon, and how it will set a precedent for future similar crimes. During his presidency, President Barack Obama granted 1,715 clemencies. Most of these were for nonviolent drug offenders, in an effort to get non-serious offenders out of prison and to reverse the negative outcomes from the War on Drugs. Third is the individual's acceptance of responsibility and self-awareness of how serious their actions were. The individual's behavior, if they are creating excuses or reasons why they committed the crime, will greatly lower the chances of pardon. If the individual desires forgiveness and portrays complete responsibility for their actions, then the chances are much higher. Generally, every person who is considered for a pardon exudes these behaviors. Fourth is the legal disabilities the individual suffered from the conviction. Someone like a lawyer or doctor may have lost their licenses as a result of their conviction. This may grant reason to consider a pardon. Though pardons for this type of relief are minimal and very rare, they will not be put at a higher priority over an otherwise deserving person who has a desire for forgiveness. An example of this would be when President Andrew Johnson pardoned Dr. Samuel Mudd in 1869. Dr Mudd was imprisoned because he treated John Wilkes Booth‚Äôs leg after Booth assassinated President Lincoln in 1865. This crime wasn't a very serious crime, considering Mudd claimed he wasn't aware of Booth's actions at the time and he was doing what his profession entailed. Lastly, referrals and recommendations from people in powerful positions like politicians, attorneys, judges, and even victims are looked over carefully to decide if an individual is worthy of a pardon. A controversial pardon was President Bill Clinton pardoning his half- brother, Roger Clinton Jr., for cocaine possession and trafficking convictions.  Posthumous pardons  Posthumous pardons are rare because it is generally Department of Justice policy to not accept requests for non- living persons. This is due to the limited resources and personnel at the Department of Justice, and cases involving living persons take precedence over those who are deceased. The same procedure and reasoning are applied to clemency applications for federal misdemeanors, giving precedent to cases involving federal felony convictions. This structure is designed to allow the DOJ to devote its time to those who will receive the greatest benefit from Federal clemency. Only Presidents Clinton, W. Bush, and Trump have granted posthumous pardons.  Steps and process  The Office of the Pardon Attorney handles all and every clemency related correspondence and issue, including petitions and applications. This involves several steps. The Office receives and reviews clemency correspondences, and investigates applications along with the files sent with them to make more valid the petitioner's plea for pardoning. It then prepares a recommendation for each application, and sends it to the president for his final decision as to whether or not to grant a pardon. For 125 years, the key adviser to the president on clemency has been the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney (PARDON) which normally reviews all requests for pardons. Based on government data, lawyers, advocates for criminal justice advocates, and former officials from both the White House and pardon, President Trump has regularly bypassed the pardon attorney, according to a 2020 investigation by The Washington Post. Unlike previous Presidents, Trump has granted clemency to \\"well-connected offenders who had not filed petitions with the pardon office or did not meet its requirements.\\" References Further reading  Crouch, Jeffrey (2009).

Sponsored by the Student Association, WNYF was founded in 1979 by two communications students, Robert Raff and Ken Kazubowski. At the time, the TV and Radio majors (BA) were classified under Special Studies, and students developed a custom degree program. Students were limited in hands-on time in the existing black and white studio, and the color studio controlled by the IRC was often booked for months at a time. WNYF immediately gave students enhanced opportunities to develop the necessary skills to excel in the TV industry. The original student leaders, along with John Malcolm and engineer Bob Kovacs, were able to locate surplus video equipment scattered across the many departments of the college. Negotiations, trades and some \\"midnight raids\\" produced almost enough equipment to get the station running. The only piece missing was a small master control switcher, which was purchased with the very first funding from the Student Association. WNYF's original local programming included a wide variety of student produced programs ranging from entertainment, music, educational and even a student-written soap opera. In the station's first few months of existence, it began televising the annual dance marathon known as Superdance. The event raised funds for Muscular Dystrophy. The around-the-clock coverage of the dance raised the awareness and prestige of this event and substantially increased participation over the next few years. WNYF maintains an archive of every show produced by the students since then. Relocated several times, WNYF settled into its current location in Hendrix Hall in 1997. WNYF broadcasts to the campus on cable Channel 11, and to community on Channels 17 in Fredonia and 19 in Dunkirk. The station also uploads every episode to their YouTube channel.

In this universe, humans are slaves of aliens, the humanoid Catteni. Woven through all four of the books are details of the relationship between Kristin Bjornsen, a former slave, and Zainal, a renegade Catteni. The Catteni Series consists of the following books: *Freedom's Landing (published 1995) *Freedom's Choice (1996) *Freedom's Challenge (1998) *Freedom's Ransom (2002) Story The initial story about the Catteni preceded the books by many years. The Thorns of Barevi first appeared in 1970 (and is included in the collection Get Off the Unicorn, 1977). A human female, Kristin Bjornsen, escapes slavery, but unlike others before her, she resourcefully evades capture for months. However, a Catteni gets injured nearby, and helping him betrays her fugitive existence. This story was modified and included as the beginning of the Freedom's Landing novel. In Freedom's Landing, the Catteni routinely round up human troublemakers and drop them on empty planets ‚Äì if they survive, the world is suitable for their own people. Kristin is included in such a group, which is dropped on a world they name Botany (after the Australian destination for transportees, Botany Bay). Surprisingly, a Catteni noble, Zainal, is among their group - the same one Kristin helped earlier. While trying to cope with their new situation, they discover the existence of another alien race that is using the planet as a gigantic farm. Kristin is at first the only one to vouch for Zainal but he soon proves his usefulness to the rest of the improvised colony. They steal technology from the mechanisms that are used to farm the planet Botany. She and Zainal fall in love. In Freedom's Choice, the humans begin to create a real colony, a community that can support itself. They also attempt to contact the aliens farming the planet, hoping to receive information about them, their origins, and possible help against the Catteni. The colonists also learn that the Catteni are not the real enemies: they are being dominated and controlled by another race, the Eosi. In Freedom's Challenge, having discovered that the Catteni are dominated by another alien species, the Eosi, the colonists lead an effort to rescue the families of some of the dissident Catteni from the Eosi-controlled world Catten and create a rebellion against the Eosi to free not only Catten, but also Earth and every other planet and colony controlled by the Eosi. Freedom's Ransom deals with the aftermath of the rebellion. Starting on Botany, then to Earth, then to Barevi, Zainal conceives of a complex trade relationship that will benefit the humans, the Catteni, and their other alien allies. Many of the things they trade are coffee and dentistry. They need the vast amount of supplies looted from Terra. Comments The original short story, \\"The Thorns of Barevi\\" (1970), had a rape-fantasy component that was removed when it was reworked into the first novel, Freedom's Landing.

Biography McClellan was born in Kobe, Japan, in 1925 to a Japanese mother, Teruko Yokobori and British father, an early representative of Lever Brothers in Japan. His mother and older brother died when he was two. McClellan and his father were repatriated to Britain in 1942 aboard the Tatsuta Maru, a passenger liner requisitioned by the Japanese navy (and later torpedoed by a U.S. submarine) to repatriate British nationals from throughout Southeast Asia. In London, McClellan taught Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies as part of the war effort. At 18, he joined the Royal Air Force, hoping to become a pilot, but his fluency in Japanese made him more useful to Allied intelligence. He spent the years 1944-1947 in Washington, D.C., analyzing intercepted Japanese communications. In 1948, he went to the University of St. Andrews, where he earned a degree in British history and met his future wife, Rachel Elizabeth Pott. At St. Andrews he also met the noted political theorist Russell Kirk, who took him on as his graduate student at Michigan State University. Two years later, McClellan transferred to the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago to work with classicist David Grene and economist and philosopher Friedrich von Hayek. McClellan appealed to Hayek to write his doctoral dissertation on the novelist Natsume S≈çseki, whose work was much admired in Japan but unknown in the West. To persuade Hayek of S≈çseki's importance as a writer and interpreter of Japanese modernity, McClellan translated S≈çseki's novel Kokoro into English. McClellan's definitive translation of Kokoro was published in 1957. Awarded his doctorate in 1957, McClellan taught English at Chicago until 1959 when he was asked to create a program in Japanese studies, housed in the university's Oriental Institute. He became full professor and founding chair of the Department of Far Eastern Languages and Civilizations in 1965, and later was made the Carl Darling Buck Professor. In 1972, he moved to Yale University and served as chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Literature 1973-1982 and 1988-1991. He was appointed as the Sumitomo Professor of Japanese Studies in 1979, the first chair at a U.S. university to be endowed by a Japanese sponsor. In 1999, McClellan was named a Sterling Professor, Yale's highest professorial honor. McClellan was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1998 he was honored by the Japanese government with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon. His other major awards include the Kikuchi Kan Prize (ËèäÊ±†ÂØõË≥û) for literature in 1994, the Noma Prize for literary translation in 1995 and the Association for Asian Studies Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies in 2005. In addition to his committee work at Chicago and Yale, McClellan served on the Board of the Council for International Exchange of Scholars (CIES), the American Advisory Committee of the Japan Foundation, the American Oriental Society, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the editorial board of the Journal of Japanese Studies, and visiting committees in East Asian studies at Harvard and Princeton. His publications include translations of novels by Natsume S≈çseki (in addition to Kokoro, Grass on the Wayside) and Shiga Naoya (A Dark Night's Passing); the translation of a memoir by Yoshikawa Eiji; a book of essays, Two Japanese Novelists: Soseki and Toson; and a biography of 19th-century Japanese \\"bluestocking\\" Shibue Io, Woman in a Crested Kimono. A festschrift published in his honor by the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, notes: \\"Among McClellan's students his seminars have become lore. ... The depth and breadth of readings these seminars required were a revolution in pedagogy when McClellan first began them over 20 years ago; and they continue to represent an ideal of graduate training in the field. ... He taught his students to ask the most fundamental questions about the literary imagination: how language functions within the history of literary forms and in the context of society, history, politics and the existential yearnings of a singular imagination.\\" McClellan remained a British citizen until his death. His wife, Rachel, died in January 2009. He is succeeded by a son, Andrew, of Watertown, Massachusetts; a daughter, Sarah, of Somerville, Massachusetts; and five grandsons.

Chemin de la Montagne also used to have a northern section which started from Chemin Pink and ended in Luskville in the Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais region. In the past, it also used to run all the way to the Casino du Lac-Leamy before it was renamed Boulevard du Casino east of Saint-Joseph. Eastern section The eastern section passes between two residential areas and is often very crowded (if not overcrowded), especially in the rush hours, where long lineups can be seen as motorists head towards Autoroute 5 (also caused by the lack of adequate access to Autoroute 50. There is also heavy volume near Cite-des- Jeunes Boulevard and it is sometimes congested due to the increasing amount of traffic heading towards Le Plateau. There have also been complaints of speeding during the night as numerous motorists are traveling at very high speed in that stretch due to a hill. Southern Section After passing Boulevard de la Cite-des-Jeunes, it becomes a four-lane divided road (near freeway status) crossing Gatineau Park.

Andorra is a part of Roxborough, being within the borders of the original Roxborough Township and having the same zip code (19128). At some point during the 19th or 20th century, Andorra developed a cultural identity as a neighborhood within Roxborough. Andorra (which occupies one of the higher elevations in Philadelphia, on bluffs overlooking the Schuylkill River) was named \\"Andorra\\" after a fancied resemblance to the small country of the same name which sits astride the Pyrenees between France and Spain.. Andorra borders Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Although within Philadelphia city limits, Andorra resembles suburban Montgomery County more than Philadelphia city neighborhoods. Andorra was established and developed in 1950 and therefore has stereotypically suburban characteristics, such as a strip mall, many single or double-family dwellings set back from the street, and apartment buildings on large lots with ample off-street parking. History Andorra was originally the site of two large estates originally purchased by Henry H. Houston in the 1880s. Houston and Pennsylvania Railroad President Alexander Cassatt lobbied for a railroad connection between Chestnut Hill and the Main Line suburbs that would have run parallel to Ridge Avenue, but ultimately did not come to fruition. In the early 20th Century, Henry H. Houston's son, Sam Houston, made several attempts to sell the estates to institutions; in 1921, Houston unsuccessfully lobbied to use the land to host the Sesquicentennial Exposition. Houston worked with the Roxborough government to create an east-west roadway and two bridges designed by Paul Philippe Cret that would have crossed both the Schuylkill River and Wissahickon Creek; the plan was approved in 1927 but was never built. In 1922, plans for the east- west road (the current Cathedral Drive) returned to the drawing board when the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania purchased from the Houston Estate to construct the world's largest Episcopal cathedral. Spearheaded by Bishop Philip M. Rhinelander, the Gothic-style cathedral was to be 1000 feet long and contain a 300-foot tall tower with bells cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Ground was broken in 1932, but construction was stalled following the Great Depression and the Episcopal Church's redirected efforts toward the Washington National Cathedral; only the apse and a side chapel were ever built and are currently home to St. Mary's Church. In the 1940s, Houston unsuccessfully attempted to sell additional estate land to both the Veterans Administration, Temple University, and a proposed site for the Headquarters of the United Nations. In 1948, the Houston Estate and Planning Commission recruited architect Eero Saarinen to design the master plan for a proposed suburban development called \\"Cathedral Hills\\". Houston began development of the Cathedral Hills plan, which was renamed to \\"Andorra\\". The development included plans for over 5,000 single-family homes, duplexes, and apartments designed by Robert Rodes McGoodwin, although only 400 were ever built. Houston created an \\"Indenture of Covenants\\" for Andorra homeowners, which included stipulations such as no signs larger than one square foot, no ‚Äúnoxious, dangerous, or offensive behavior‚Äù, and a ban on raising livestock. Following Houston's death in 1952, the Indenture was transferred to the community, which was eventually turned into the Andorra Homes Civic Association. Education The neighborhood Catholic grade school is Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM).

Transportation Ridge Avenue, along with Henry Avenue (which splits off from Ridge Avenue in Andorra), are the major thoroughfares in Andorra. Other significant streets are Bells Mill Road, a 2-lane link through Fairmount Park and over the Wissahickon Creek which is the quickest way for cars (trucks or buses are prohibited) to reach Chestnut Hill from Andorra and Roxborough; Port Royal Avenue; and Cathedral Road.

The property is historically part of the Irvine Ranch, and was a land preserve up until the creation of the community. The Irvine Company decided to build the planned community in 1982; it was approved for construction in 1986 by the County of Orange. It was annexed to the city of Tustin in 1986, and formed the 92782 ZIP Code. The Tustin Ranch was formerly a citrus ranch prior to the 1980s before its development. Today, no citrus ranches can be found on the Tustin Ranch plan, but almost all of the community streets are named after components of the former ranch. The plan called for the creation of 7,000 residential units, from mansions to apartments to accommodate the variety of residents living in Orange County. The community falls within the Tustin Unified School District, and currently includes four schools within the ZIP code.

A construction project add a new gym and classrooms. School design Allen W. Roberts School, built in 1962, was created in the style of a California high school; this means that students would have to venture outside in order to switch classes, go to the nurse, use the gym facility, etc. Unfortunately, the area does not have a climate that is ideal for this type of construction; most notably a wet and rainy fall, and occasional severe winters. In the early 1990s, a construction project was undertaken to transform the school from this style to be fully enclosed. Just recently, the open structure that connected the main building to the secondary building was closed with the addition of new classrooms. Population and expansion crisis New Providence used to have two other elementary schools, Hillview and Lincoln. Lincoln School was sold to the borough for $1 in 1980; the property was used for a new municipal center.Timeline, New Providence Historical Society. Accessed September 14, 2018. Hillview was being leased to a local child care provider, since student populations in the 1980s and 1990s did not necessitate a third elementary school. In the early 1990s, it was determined that it was no longer necessary to keep this school. Moreover, it was felt that the cost to modernize the school, mostly in HVAC infrastructure and asbestos removal, was too costly and would not be worth the fund allocation. In an effort spearheaded by then Superintendent Geoffrey Gordon, Hillview was sold to private and public interests: a YMCA currently operates there, as does the Morris-Union Jointure Commission. Right after the Hillview sale, 7th and 8th grade instruction was moved from the elementary schools to the high school, due to rising student populations in the lower grades. During the first few years of this facility merger, the high school population was low enough that they could effectively share facilities but did not have a need to share classrooms. However, school populations readily increased and both the middle and high schools saw the need for extra classrooms. Moreover, during the years of 1997-1998, the school population started to explode at the Kindergarten and first-grade levels, indicating that there would be a future need for expanded facilities. The district and town recognized the need for expanded facilities. In 1998 the Board of Education floated bonds to pay for several construction efforts. Four new classrooms were added in 1998. A new television studio and music room was added in 2001. In 2003, a new gym was built and the cafeteria was expanded. These construction projects would not have been necessary if the town had retained its Hillview facility, causing some residents to consider the wisdom of selling the facility in the first place. The critics' main concern is the perceivable lack of long-term considerations. Currently, the owners of Hillview have no desire to sell the facility back to the borough. As of September 27, 2005 a $10 million bond was passed by referendum for additional school construction.

Tohono O'odham version In the Tohono O'odham legend, at the beginning of time the Great Spirit finds clay by digging a hole; he then drops the clay into the hole again and out comes Montezuma, who assists him in bringing out all the Indian tribes, with the Apache last of all. It is said that all men and animals were speaking a common language in the early days; however a great flood destroyed everyone, with only Montezuma and his friend, Coyote, escaping. Because Coyote had warned him of the flood beforehand, Montezuma had fashioned a boat that he kept prepared on the peak of the Santa Rosa Mountains in Arizona. Coyote likewise made a boat for himself, by gnawing down a giant cane and stopping it with gum. After the flood had subsided, Montezuma and Coyote meet again atop Monte Rosa, and Montezuma sends Coyote out four times, once in each direction, to find out how far the sea is. He quickly returned from the south and the west, reporting that it was nearby. The journey east took a bit longer, but eventually he found the sea there also. Finally, he journeys northward and never finds water before growing tired. Meanwhile, the Great Spirit, helped by Montezuma, has again repopulated the world with people and animals. Montezuma is entrusted with the governance of mankind, but becoming proud and wicked, he rebels against the Great Spirit, dismisses Coyote, and commands mankind to build a house tall enough to reach Heaven. Before he can succeed at this endeavour, the Great Spirit casts it down with thunderbolts, causing a confusion in the languages of mankind. Persisting in his wickedness, Montezuma commands all the temples be destroyed; in response, the Great Spirit punishes him by sending a locust to the east to summon the Spanish, who make war on Montezuma and destroy him. This legend was related by chief Con Quien of the Tohono O'odham and published in the Indian Affairs Report of 1865, p. 131. Bancroft, writing later in the 19th century (Native Races vol 3), speculates that the name of the historical Aztec Emperors Moctezuma (more properly Motecuhzoma in Nahuatl) was the ultimate origin of the mythical hero-god's name -- the name being \\"gradually associated in the minds of some of the New Mexican and neighboring tribes, with a vague, mythical, and departed grandeur\\", until \\"all the lesser heroes would be gradually absorbed in the greater, and their names forgotten. Their deeds would become his deeds, their fame his fame.\\" However, other references among the Arizona and New Mexico tribes indicate a belief in \\"Montezuma\\" as having been the name of a great king and law-giver of the remote past, who ruled over a vast empire including Mexico, and who is said to be buried inside a particular mountain in Arizona that allegedly bears his image. In 1737, a religious prophet appeared among the Guaima and Pima Indians (Akimel O'odham), close relatives of the Tohono O'odham. This was Agust√≠n Ascuchul, who claimed that the god Moctezuma had appeared to him and named him his prophet. He called on the Indians to follow him to a new place, to worship the god. More than 5,000 Indians abandoned their homes to follow the prophet. The governor of Sonora, Juan Bautista de Anza, interpreted this as a rebellion. He soon suppressed it and hanged the prophet. Pueblo version Montezuma also figures prominently in the religion of the Pueblo, who held that their god- king Montezuma was variously from Taos, Acoma, or one of the other pueblos, and was conceived from a beautiful virgin and a pinyon pine nut. Although weak as a youth, he was chosen to be their unlikely leader, and surprised everyone with his miracles, including the ability to produce rain. He taught the people their customs, and how to build the adobe pueblos. One day he kindled a fire that they were never to allow to burn out, then departed for Mexico (in some versions, on the back of an eagle), promising to return some day and save them from the Spanish. U.S. Attorney W.W.H. Davis, who visited the Laguna Pueblo in 1855, was allowed a rare glimpse at some sort of idol or icon of their god Montezuma, whereof he gave a vivid description in his book El Gringo. According to Davis, this object was round, nine inches tall and in diameter, and made of tanned skin. The cover was painted half red and half green, and on the green side were triangular holes for eyes, round pieces of leather for the mouth and ears, and no nose. He said it was kept wrapped in cloth, and was sprinkled with a 'white powder'. The Swiss-American ethnographer Adolph Bandelier asserted in the 1890s that these legends had been invented by the Pueblos fifty years earlier solely to impress American explorers, and were not really part of their religion; he cited a document purporting to be a secret plot to 'teach' the natives that they were the descendants of Emperor Montezuma for political purposes, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. However, other documents have since come to light showing that the Spanish too were quite aware of Montezuma's renown in the Pueblo region long before then‚Äîthe earliest such recorded reference dating to 1694, when the natives told Jesuit Father Eusebio Francisco Kino that Montezuma had built what is today known as Casa Grande (Wilson 1999, p.16). Finally, Llewellyn Harris, a Welsh-American Mormon missionary who visited the Zuni in 1878, claimed that they told him they were descended from Montezuma, who was himself descended from white men called \\"Cambaraga\\" who came from over the sea 300 years before the Spanish, and that they still had many Welsh words in their language (see Madoc for many more tales along this theme). However, these much more sensational claims have never been independently verified.

This road starts at Chemin Vanier in Aylmer before it finishes at Boulevard Saint-Raymond, and Route 148. It is home to the new D'Arcy McGee English high school which recently moved from its former location near the Hull Hospital, several kilometers away. This roadway, which was fairly tranquil until the mid 1990s became very busy after 2000, as the community has grown rapidly. The increasing number of residents, was one of the reasons why retail and commercial development has exploded, similar to the likes of Barrhaven's Marketplace district as well as the Kanata Centrum and the Holy Trinity/Avalon district of Orleans. Since the late 1990s Loblaws, SuperC, Reitmans, Moores, Wal-Mart Canada, Rona and Bureau en Gros stores have been built in rapid succession, A large 16 theatre movie complex known as StarCit√© Hull was also built, making it the largest of its kind in the city of Gatineau. Local residents have expressed concerns about the growing number of superstores in the area, and have asked the city to slow the expansion of the commercial district, as traffic has been getting increasingly congested during shopping hours. However, there is still ample open space left for development, allowing for more stores in the future when the road is completed. In addition, the nearby Boulevard des Allumetti√®res (formerly Boulevard de l'Outaouais) highway, also known as the Highway 50/148 extension will give eastern residents of the city much faster and easier access to the big-box stores in the area which would add to traffic congestion.

Brewton-Parker is affiliated with the Georgia Baptist Convention and celebrated its centennial in 2004.Turner, Ann C.: \\"Brewton-Parker College\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia, July 7, 2005 History In 1904, Reverend John Carter Brewton, pastor of the McRae Baptist Church, and Charles Benton Parker, a prominent businessman in McRae, resolved to establish a private boarding school to serve elementary and high school students from Montgomery County and the surrounding area. As there were no public high schools at that time, the school played an important role in furthering the education of the area‚Äôs youth. The Telfair and Daniell Baptist associations were enthusiastic supporters. The school was placed between Mount Vernon and Ailey, as working together the town bid more support than any either community. The Union Baptist Institute, chartered April 28, 1904, joined with other Baptist associations, with Rev. Brewton as elected president of its board of trustees. The co-ed Union Baptist Institute formally opened on September 12, 1905 with a four-building campus, serving 160 students in grades one through eleven. The school's first year was very successful and as word spread, enrollment more than doubled to 365. In 1912 the school was renamed to Brewton-Parker Institute; it was accredited in 1918 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Brewton-Parker Institute became a junior college after college freshmen and sophomore classes were added in 1923 and 1927. Elementary classes were removed in 1929. In 1948, high school classes were also removed. The school was renamed Brewton-Parker Junior College and transferred to the governance of the Georgia Baptist Convention. By the early 1980s, public two-year community colleges had been established throughout the state. At the same time, there was a greater demand for graduates of four-year colleges. In mind of these changes, the school evolved on December 9, 1986 into a four-year institution, Brewton‚ÄìParker College. Fraud Scandal hit the college in the late 1990s over fraud in the school's financial aid department. A lawsuit against the school was brought about by Martha Faw, then the assistant director of financial aid. An investigation begun by the United States Department of Education confirmed that Pell Grants had been given to ineligible students, payments had been made to non-U.S. citizens, and guidelines for work-study programs were not followed. In 1998, Brewton‚ÄìParker College agreed to repay the government $4 million in what was said to be the largest qui tam recovery in Georgia history. College president Y. Lynn Holmes resigned.Taxpayers Against Fraud Quarterly Review, Vol. 14, July 1998, 54-55.Thompson, Ginger: \\"Whistle-blower Gives Back To Target\\" Chicago Tribune, June 16, 1998\\"Brewton-Parker College Sued for Financial-Aid Fraud\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, October 3, 1997 Dr. David R. Smith became college president in 1998, and at his first graduation address, Smith stated: \\"To any and all who recognized inept policies and errant behavior, and who continued to speak out against such things even in the face of opposition from those who preferred not to hear it, you should be applauded, not ridiculed.\\" The college briefly outsourced the administration of their financial aid program until a new college policy and procedures manual was established in the Fall of 2000. A new position, Director of Financial Aid Compliance was established.\\"5.6.2.5 Director of Financial Aid Compliance\\" Brewton-Parker College, Policy and Procedure Manual Campus The main college campus is in Mount Vernon on and includes forty- six buildings, outdoor athletic properties, and a lake.  Organization and administration  Brewton-Parker is affiliated with the Georgia Baptist Convention. Its endowment was $13.3 million in 2007.  Academic profile  BPC now offers undergraduate degrees in seven academic departments with 19 majors. Most of its programs have internships, offering practical, hands-on experience as well as academic content. Further, in applicable areas, undergraduates are encouraged to participate with faculty in performing research and presenting papers. As the only independent college in rural southeast Georgia, BPC plays an important educational role in one of the state‚Äôs poorest areas. It serves many first generation college students and provides learning assistance to other, non-traditional students seeking to improve their knowledge and skills. Among private colleges, Brewton-Parker enrolls three times as many minority students as the national average. There is a 2:1 female-male student ratio and a 15:1 student-faculty ratio. The student body is 73.2% Caucasian, 24% African American, 2% Hispanic, 0.5% Asian American or Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American. Regional accreditation issues In June 2012, the college's regional accreditor placed the college on probation. Two years later, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) voted to remove Brewton‚ÄìParker College from membership. The college appealed the decision and retained its accreditation during the process. In late 2014, the college successfully presented evidence compliance SACS standards; its accreditation was reaffirmed and its probation status lifted.  Student life  Intramural sports include basketball, football, softball, table tennis, tennis, ultimate Frisbee, and volleyball.

History Sussex Swans were formed in the early 1990s, with the British Australian Rules Football League quite keen to expand with teams outside London. The Sydney Swans donated on the first set of footy jumpers that was to last three years. It was intended to replace the Sydney Opera House logo with a representation of the Brighton Pavilion when a new set of jumpers was needed. The Swans' first game in the BARFL was on 21 April 1991 at King's Manor Upper School ground in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex against the Bristol Bears. The Swans were defeated by a large margin. In the first year the Swans lost every game with the team largely being made up of British players and with only an average of four Australians. Their first victory finally came during the 1992 season. In 1993 the Sussex Swans moved to Crawley Rugby Club, won the first game of the season against the Bristol Bears and then beat the East Midland Eagles in round two - the only time to date the Swans have led the BARFL ladder. 1998 saw the Swans reach the BARFL Premiership finals for the first time, losing to the Wimbledon Hawks in the semi-finals. 1999 saw the Swans reach the semi final of the Pre Season Cup for the first time, though they were defeated by the more experienced Wandsworth Demons. In 2001, ten members of the Swans' squad were selected for the British Bulldogs side for the Atlantic Alliance Cup held in London. And the Swans made it through to the semi-finals of the pre season cup narrowly missing out on a grand final spot after being defeated by North London. (future AFL player Michael Rix then on o/s travel played in these matches). The Sydney Swans at this time were again supportive and interested in the club. And donated a set of playing jumpers to the club. Sent directly after an AFL game in Adelaide. This gesture was warmly received. The Swans also gained media attention in the back pages of the Melbourne's 'Herald Sun' in 2001 after an audacious attempt to lure AFL bad boy Wayne Carey to play while he was in AFL limbo. 2002 and 2003 seasons turning point In 2002 the club playing numbers and on-field performance continued to improve and many new players could no longer be guaranteed a game. In what was a bold plan it was decided at the end of this season that in 2003 the Swans would enter a second team into the then BARFL. This team would not be based in Sussex. It would be London based. It would be known to start with as the City Swans and play in the conference league while Sussex remained in the premiership division. The idea did have its doubters and met with initial resistance from some quarters. One league official was quoted as saying \\"we will never allow it\\". This view instead of closing the idea of a new London based Swans team actually inspired then Club President Sam Dixon, Coach Alex Hill and Captain Dave Sheehan to push ahead with the plan regardless. As they shared a collective vision for the Swans having a team in London which would enhance on field performance and player growth strategies. 2003 The first London based pre-season training session was promoted to take place in Regents Park. Over 60 new and existing players turned up validating the belief the London Swans could start a London team and training base. A new sponsor the Shaftesbury Walkabout came on board donating new jumpers, club shirts, VIP entry and player half price drink cards. As well providing the 'Red Room' in the West End Walkabout to conduct what became very, very popular social events. On the field the new Swans London team debuted in the first match of the season. A a double header played against the two reigning premiers of premiership and conference divisions both from the North London Lions club. In what was a huge BARFL upset result at the time, both Swans teams recorded victories for the first time ever respectively against the BARFL powerhouse North London club. It was a highpoint for this era and the genesis of the London Swans as they are known today. One of the Swans players' wives, Aleisha Scanlon, was instrumental in entering the 'Swanettes' netball teams into a London netball league for the first time. The City Swans made it through to the BARFL finals in their first year. And Brian Clarke's Australian touring composite team 'The Convicts' chose to play an end of season non-league fixture against the Swans in what was a great match. The Swans continued in the BARFL Premiership competition and field a second team - the City Swans - in the BARFL London Conference. This Conference team finished fifth in the ladder in 2006, narrowly missing a place in the Finals. In 2007 the Swans moved from their traditional Sussex home to a London base, with a presence remaining in Sussex through the new third team created to compete in a new regional league. 2007 and 2008 seasons Throughout 2007 and 2008 the Swans established themselves as one of the leading clubs in the London AFL league. They are now the only club truly based in Central London, with training and home games held at Regent's Park. The 2008 season was key to the club, with the EU base expanding, and a memorable win against the Wandsworth Demons in the last game of the season, held on 26 July 2008. The Swans kicked four goals in the last five minutes of the game, defeating the Demons by one goal. However, after mixed fortunes on the pitch during the year, they ended the season fifth in the ladder. 2010 ANZAC Cup victory In 2010, the London Swans were victorious in the 16th Annual ANZAC Cup held at Osterley.http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/sport/Happy-21st-for-Swans The Swans went through the round-robin tournament undefeated, with victories over West London Wildcats and North London Lions in the preliminary stages, before defeating Putney Magpies in the semi final. In the Grand Final, the Swans faced North London Lions and after a strong second half, ran away victors by 2 goals. Best on ground was awarded to new recruit Anthony Raso, who dominated across the forward line all day, taking several spectacular 'Warwick Capper- style' marks. Future developments The Swans are currently undergoing a period of extensive change, resulting in many areas of the club expanding. The club is being successful in recruiting many new EU players, and full-fledged Netball teams are now also part of the club's London operations. The Swans are currently the only BARFL club in the country working towards their own youth academy.

He was released from prison to his family on the night of 27 March. On 29 March, Abdul Rahman arrived in Italy after the Italian government offered him political asylum. Abdul Rahman's arrest and trial brought international attention to an apparent contradiction in the Constitution of Afghanistan, which recognizes both a limited form of freedom of religion and the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, which mandates the death penalty for male apostates from Islam. The case became a cause c√©l√®bre and attracted widespread international condemnation, notably from the United Kingdom and the United States, both of whom led the campaign to remove the fundamentalist Taliban regime in 2001 and are the main donors of aid to Afghanistan. Early life Abdul Rahman was born in 1965. In 1990, when working as a staff member for a Catholic non-governmental aid group providing medical assistance to Afghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan, he came in touch with Christianity and was subsequently baptised into the Roman Catholic Church.

He is not going in the right direction. I have thrown him out of my house\\", while his daughters said that \\"He behaves badly with us and we were threatened and disgraced by him.

Authorities barred attempts by the Associated Press news agency to see him. Legal experts say Abdul Rahman's case existed because of contradictory laws in the Afghan Constitution recognizing both freedom of religion and the Hanafi school of sharia law. Article 130 of the Constitution of Afghanistan enables prosecutors to charge him for apostasy \\"in accordance with the Hanafi jurisprudence\\". The text of the article says: > In cases under consideration, the courts shall apply provisions of this > Constitution as well as other laws.

Ansarullah Mawlawizadah, the chief judge in the case, said that Abdul Rahman would be asked to reconsider his conversion: \\"We will invite him again because the religion of Islam is one of tolerance. We will ask him if he has changed his mind. If so we will forgive him.\\" Ansarullah Mawlafizada also said \\"the Prophet Muhammad has said several times that those who convert from Islam should be killed if they refuse to come back, Islam is a religion of peace, tolerance, kindness and integrity. That is why we have told him if he regrets what he did, then we will forgive him\\". The judge added more: \\"If [he] does not repent, you will all be witness to the sort of punishment he will face.\\" When facing a possible death sentence, Abdul Rahman held firm to his convictions: \\"They want to sentence me to death and I accept it‚Ä¶ I am a Christian, which means I believe in the Trinity‚Ä¶ I believe in Jesus Christ.\\"\\"Afghan Man Faces Execution After Converting to Christianity\\" , by Benjamin Sand, VOA News, March 18, 2006, retrieved March 28, 2006 Efforts by Afghan Christians While Abdul Rahman was on trial, a number of Afghan Christians worked to bring the attention of the International Media towards the suffering of the Afghan Christians and especially Abdul Rahman. Mental fitness to stand trial The Afghan Embassy in Washington, D.C. announced on March 22 that the country's judicial system was evaluating Abdul Rahman's mental fitness. Moayuddin Baluch, a religious adviser to President Hamid Karzai confirmed Abdul Rahman would undergo a psychological examination. Judge Mawlawizadah stated that since Rahman refused to repent then his mental state was being examined. If he was found to be mentally unfit, the case would be dismissed. Abdul Rahman's conversion to Christianity, while knowing that doing so is punishable by death, was viewed by some as evidence of mental incompetence. An Afghanistan state prosecutor Sarinwal Zamari said of Abdul Rahman in an interview with the Associated Press on March 22, 2006, \\"We think he could be mad. He is not a normal person. He doesn't talk like a normal person. Doctors must examine him. If he is mentally unfit, definitely Islam has no claim to punish him. He must be forgiven. The case must be dropped.\\" Other sources said Rahman is \\"perennially jobless and mentally unbalanced\\". Prosecutor Abdul Wasei said he doubted claims regarding Abdul Rahman's mental instability. \\"I did not see any kind of mental problem in this case,\\" he said. Wasei said that Rahman, when asked about his mental health, insisted that it was fine. \\"I am O.K., you can prosecute me, I can answer your questions,\\" Wasei said Rahman told him. Diplomats said that the Afghan government was \\"desperately searching for a way to drop the case\\" by declaring Abdul Rahman mentally unfit to stand trial. The court also raised questions about Rahman's nationality. Rahman had lived abroad, in Germany, Greece and Belgium. If he had acquired dual nationality, it was argued, the status of his case could change. There were various opinions regarding Abdul Rahman being declared unfit for trial. Critics said that declaring him insane would not solve what they regarded as a constitutional flaw that allows prosecution under Islamic law. An editorial in The Washington Times wrote that declaring him mentally unfit is \\"a manufactured loophole\\" which would enable the Afghan government \\"to back down to avoid a disastrous internal and diplomatic crisis. This solution, such as it is, won't resolve the underlying discrepancy in Afghanistan's constitution.\\" A New York Times editorial echoed these sentiments, saying that declaring Abdul Rahman mentally incompetent was a way for the Afghan government to \\"avoid the mess\\" and \\"that would be a cheap trick because the law would remain on the books.\\" In France, Marianne magazine stated Western critics of the case might not be satisfied if the Kabul court avoided the death sentence for Abdul Rahman by declaring him insane and unfit for trial. \\"If he is not tried, he will probably end up in a psychiatric hospital, which for a man of sound mind is sometimes worse than death.\\" Release On March 24, 2006, Afghan authorities announced that they were considering releasing Abdul Rahman soon. A special government meeting on his case was held on the following day during which President Hamid Karzai conferred with several Cabinet ministers for a way to free him without angering the country's powerful conservative Muslim clerics who have called for Abdul Rahman's execution. After this meeting an unnamed senior government official said there is a \\"strong possibility\\" that Abdul Rahman would be freed on Sunday the 26th.Afghan convert likely to be freed after Karzai intervention , by Sardar Ahmad, mq7.net, 26 March 2006, retrieved 28 March 2006 However the case prosecutor dismissed any claims that Abdul Rahman was to be released.

Nicholas Burns, \\"I know that it is a very sensitive issue and we know the concerns of the American people. In fact, in our embassy we received hundreds of messages of such kind. As far as I understand the nature of the case has been that the wife of the gentleman has registered a lawsuit against her husband. And then the Government of Afghanistan has nothing to do in it. It's a legal and judicial case. But I hope that through our constitutional process there will be a satisfactory result out of that process.\\"U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Briefing , Scoop, March 23, 2006, retrieved March 28, 2006 He also stated: \\"Every time we have a case it is like an alarm. These contradictions [between freedom of religion and sharia] will not go away with one or two cases.\\" Ansarullah Mawlawizadah announced international pressure will not affect his rulings in the case, saying: \\"There is no direct pressure on our court so far, but if it happens we will consider it as an interference. We have a constitution and law here. Nobody has the right to put pressure on us.\\" In an interview to AFP, Mawlawizadah confirmed his position: \\"We have nothing to do with diplomatic issues. We'll do our job independently.\\" He says that he expects to rule in the case in the next several days. Muslim clerics After Abdul Rahman's arrest and the subsequent outrage and criticism of the Afghan government, notable Afghan clerics spoke out against his possible release. Afghan clerics have denounced what they assert is interference by other countries and by President Hamid Karzai with the autonomy of the Afghan courts. Maulavi Habibullah told more than a thousand clerics and young people gathered in Kabul that \\"Afghanistan does not have any obligation under international laws. The prophet says, when somebody changes religion, he must be killed.\\"\\"Preachers in Kabul Urge Execution of Convert to Christianity\\" , by Abdul Waheed Wafa, The New York Times, March 25, 2006, retrieved March 28, 2006 Many clerics have spoken out to the media saying that Abdul Rahman should receive the death penalty for apostasy. Cleric Enayatullah Baligh, speaking at one of Kabul's main mosques said, \\"We respect all religions but we don't go into the British embassy or the American embassy to see what religion they are following. We won't let anyone interfere with our religion and he should be punished.\\" Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai, a prominent mujahidin leader and head of the Hizb-i-Iqtadar-i-Islami Afghanistan, and former acting prime minister in the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani before the Taliban came to power in 1996, said, \\"Regardless of the court decision [whether or not he is hanged], there is unanimous agreement by all religious scholars from the north to the south, the east to the west of Afghanistan, that Abdul Rahman should be executed. There is widespread dissent among the masses against the activities of Christian missionaries. These missions exploit the poverty of Afghan people and they pay them to convert. These activities will only translate into fierce reaction as Afghans do not tolerate anything against their religion. Since Abdul Rahman comes from Panjshir, people of the area are coming down to Kabul to show their dissent against him and demand that the court execute him.\\" Muslim cleric Abdul Raouf, a member of Afghanistan's main Islamic organization, the Afghan Ulama Council, stated \\"Rejecting Islam is insulting God. We will not allow God to be humiliated. This man must die.\\" Raouf, who is described by the AP as \\"moderate\\", is quoted as saying: \\"Cut off his head!\\" and \\"We will call on the people to pull him into pieces so there's nothing left.\\" Raouf said Abdul Rahman will only survive if he goes into exile. During his sermon at Herati Mosque on March 24, 2006, Raouf told around 150 worshippers that Abdul Rahman deserved death since he had \\"committed the greatest sin. God's way is the right way, and this man whose name is Abdul Rahman is an apostate.\\" Mirhossain Nasri, the top cleric at Hossainia Mosque, said \\"If he is allowed to live in the West, then others will claim to be Christian so they can too,\\" he said. \\"We must set an example. ... He must be hanged.\\" Muslim cleric Mohammed Qasim who resides in the northern city of Mazari Sharif, said: \\"We don't care if the West drops its support for us. God will look after Afghanistan.\\" Afghan public The BBC assesses that many members of the Afghan public are vocal in support of Abdul Rahman's execution, though it does not estimate if these are in the majority. \\"The courts should punish him and he should be put to death,\\" said Kabul dweller Abdul Zahid Paymen. Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: \\"According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land\\". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: \\"there is no way we are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian.\\" Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said \\"he will have to be executed‚Ä¶ If somebody at one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. This is such a big offense that the penalty can only be death. At the very most, some scholars argue that the person should be given time to rethink, and if he embraces Islam again, he will be forgiven.\\" International reactions=Calls for Abdul Rahman's release A number of Western countries and NGOs condemned his trial as a human rights violation and called for the release of the Afghan convert. * : Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Abdul Rahman's case was \\"appalling\\" and that \\"when [he] saw the report about this [he] felt sick literally. The idea that a person could be punished because of their religious belief and the idea they might be executed is just beyond belief.\\" * : The Canadian government has expressed concern, especially as the Canadian Forces have recently taken command of the coalition force in Kandahar province and the government is facing pressure to ensure the mission leads to an open, democratic Afghanistan. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper phoned Hamid Karzai and said in a written statement, \\"I phoned President Karzai personally yesterday to express our concern.

German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble has stated \\"I highly support the idea that we make it clear to Afghanistan, in every way possible, that abiding by and protecting human rights, which Afghanistan is obliged to, includes [protecting the] freedom of religion.\\" Sch√§uble also said, \\"We contribute a lot to rebuilding Afghanistan and towards its stability, so I truly believe that Afghanistan must realize that we insist upon the freedom of religion. You cannot punish people because they change their religion.\\" In response to Sch√§uble's comments, Afghan Economy Minister Amin Farhang said that the government in Kabul cannot stop donor countries from withholding aid or technical support, but consequences of such withdrawals would be worse for Western countries than Afghanistan. Farhang stated: \\"I think that politicians in the West, including in Germany, reacted very emotionally. It shouldn't be like that. There's a lack of information. And besides, while the situation hasn't been resolved and the final decision hasn't been made yet, they can't threaten to withdraw security forces or foreign aid. That amounts to blackmail.\\" Farhang also said that Kabul is attempting to build democracy after the Taliban was forced from power by US forces in 2001, but that the right to convert from Islam to Christianity is too extreme for a traditional Islamic society such as Afghanistan which upholds the Islamic punishment for apostasy. He also stated: \\"Afghanistan cannot switch suddenly from one extreme to the other.\\" See also * Islam *Kamilia Shehata *Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam *Islam and other religions *Persecution of Christians *Universal Declaration of Human Rights NotesExternal links *\\"ICC Calls on Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai to Pardon Christian under Death Sentence for Apostasy\\" - Persecution.org, 20 March 2006 *\\"In quotes: Afghan convert case\\" - BBC, 22 March 2006 * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Afghan former Muslims Category:Afghan Roman Catholics Category:Persecution of Catholics Category:Catholic Church in Afghanistan Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Islam Category:Victims of human rights abuses Category:People from Kabul Category:Afghan refugees Category:Afghan prisoners sentenced to death Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Afghanistan Category:Afghan Tajik people Category:Afghan emigrants to Italy Category:Afghan expatriates in Pakistan ","title":"Abdul Rahman (convert)"},{"id":"4451073","text":"The Mohave and Milltown Railway was a narrow gauge private railroad built in 1903 to serve the Leland Gold Mine near Oatman, Arizona, USA.

It included show openings and reviews, audition listings, and industry and union news for Chicago actors, directors, dancers, designers, and other entertainment professionals. History PerformInk started a bi-weekly trade paper for the theatre and film industries as a quarterly newsletter in 1987 in the back of Act I Bookstore. Sometime in 1989, the owner of the bookstore, Rick Levine, started printing on a bi-weekly basis and on newsprint. Carrie Kaufman was hired in June 1990 as a typist for 10 hours a week. By the end of 1990, Levine presented Carrie with the ultimatum of either making the paper profitable by the end of 1991 or closing the presses on it. It didn't make a profit that year, but it did almost triple its revenues and by the end of 1991, they were negotiating a purchase. In February 1992, PerformInk, Inc., headed by Kaufman, was created. On June 19, 2009, PerformInk published its final print edition as it switched to an all- online format. By November 2011, PerformInk published its last web update. On March 23, 2016, the website re-launched under the new ownership of Lotus Theatricals LLC, headed by Chicago theater professionals Jason Epperson and Abigail Trabue when Kaufman transferred the publications rights to them. Contents of newspaper It provided a wide range of news and information for professionals in the Chicago theatre industry. Theatre news, theatre business and Chicago industry personalities were just a few of the areas covered and discussed in each issue. Subjects affecting the careers of not only Chicago performers, but also directors, producers, designers, filmmakers and dancers were always PerformInk's focus. There were regular columns discussing specific facets of business for theater professionals. These columns include \\"Money and Taxes\\", which looked at tax and financial matters unique to the business of performing, by Greg Mermel, CPA; \\"Comedy Bites,\\" which looked at the improv industry in Chicago; and \\"Out Takes,\\" a behind the scenes look at independent film in Chicago. PerformInk was one of the primary sources for actors to get information regarding auditions. The print edition of PerformInk had a readership of over 12,000, about half of which were subscribers. PerformInk also printed ‚ÄúThe Book: An Actor‚Äôs Guide to Chicago.‚Äù The Book contained information about the business of living as an actor in Chicago, in addition to acting as a directory of services and products for industry professionals.

Machis play significant roles in Mapuche religion. In contemporary Mapuche culture, women are more commonly machis than men but it is not a rule. Description Illustration of a machi healing a patient, from Atlas of Physical and Political History of Chile (Atlas de la historia f√≠sica y pol√≠tica de Chile), by Claudio Gay As a religious authority, a machi leads healing ceremonies, called Machitun. During the machitun, the machi communicates with the spirit world. Machies also serve as advisors, and oracles for their community. In the past, they advised on peace and warfare. The term is sometimes interchangeable with the word kalku, however, kalku has a usually evil connotation whereas machi is usually considered good; this, however, is not always true since in common use the terms may be interchanged. The Mapuches live in southern South America mostly in central Chile (Araucan√≠a and Los Lagos) and the adjacent areas of Argentina. To become a machi, a Mapuche person has to demonstrate character, willpower, and courage, because initiation is long and painful. Usually a person is selected in infancy, based upon the following: * premonitory dreams * supernatural revelations * influence of the family * inheritance * her or his power of healing disease * own initiative Machiluwun is the ceremony to consecrate a new machi. The chosen child will live six months with a dedicated machi, where he or she learns the skills to serve as a machi. Role in Mapuche medicine The machi is a person of great wisdom and healing power and is the main character of Mapuche medicine. The machi has detailed knowledge of medicinal herbs and other remedies, and is also said to have the power of the spirits and the ability to interpret dreams, called pewma (IPA pronunciation: ) in Mapudungun. Machis are also said to help communities identify witches or other individuals who are using supernatural powers to do harm. Mapuche traditional medicine is gaining more acceptance in the broader Chilean society. Gender Becoming a Machi is a spiritual transformation that also fosters a place where people can flow between spectrums of gender. Within Machi rituals and ceremonies, gender is fluid and dynamic. The majority of Machi are female, but males can also be Machis. The Machi power is usually passed down from the maternal grandmother. Gender is not determined by sex, as it typically is in Chilean society, but rather by identity and spirituality and is ambiguous among Machi. Some scholars have coined this as \\"cogender\\", which is a partly feminine and partly masculine identity. Most of this research has focused on males and femininity versus females and masculinity, but all forms of gender fluidity are present within Machi culture. During some ceremonies gender is transcended and transformed spiritually, where binaries between genders do not exist and new gender identities are explored. Within Machi culture, plants and spirits are given gender. Usually these assigned genders are based upon perceptions of masculinity and femininity. E.g. Laurel is a feminine plant because it is regarded as soothing and soft, whereas Triwe is masculine because it has protective powers. These genders are fixed and do not change. Machi, however, transcend static gender and dynamically flow between them. For example, during healing ceremonies Machis can flow between male, female, and cogendered identities in order to balance the spirit of the person they are healing. As Shamans of the Foye Tree says, ‚Äúgender of spirits remain permanent, whereas Machi move between gender identities‚Äù. This is because in Machi cosmology, the Nguchen, or the giver of life, is balanced by 4 identities; the man, the woman, the young man and the young woman. Therefore, during ceremonies Machis embody some or all of these identities at different times or simultaneously in order to heal. When someone is sick, Machis believe it is because the 4 are out of balance. Thus within Mapuche culture, there are ‚Äúwell defined notions of gender, but Machis are able to manipulate them‚Äù. Thus, gender exists in two realities, the earthly where gender is fixed and spiritual where gender in fluid. Machis are able to flow between both realities freely.  Gender roles and discrimination  While the Machis accept many different and even conflicting identities, Chilean society does not. Transgender Machi women who do not fit into traditional gender roles face a lot of discrimination and transphobia. Homophobia and transphobia are rampant in Chilean and Mapuche culture. The Machis are respected, but also shunned. Machi women are not viewed fully as women by Mapuche society because of their ‚Äúmasculine power‚Äù and Machi men are not viewed fully as male because of their femininity. Male machis, also called the Machi Weye, face discrimination from other Mapuches. Males are perceived as weak for taking upon a feminized role but are simultaneously regarded as more powerful than female machis. Yet other people view them as ‚Äúnot possessing as many powers as the [female] machis‚Äù because ‚Äúfemales are more connected to nature‚Äù. Some people view male machis as more powerful and adept than female machis due to traditional gender stereotypes of women inherently being weaker. One Mapuche person states that while he discriminates against Machi men that ‚Äúwhen [he] is sick, when [he] needs a ngillatun, [he] goes begging to the male machi‚Äù. As a result of the gendered perception of Machis i.e. that they are usually female, many male machi face discrimination from fellow Mapuche and Chilean society as a whole. Since they do not fit conventional gender stereotypes, these feminine male Machis are made outcasts and called derogatory names. One Mapuche states ‚Äúthey [male machi] may be stronger, but they wear women‚Äôs clothes...He must like pigs legs‚Äù. Many male Machi dress in women‚Äôs clothing as this is perceived to be more pious and connected to nature. Machismo in Chilean society plays a large role in such discrimination as men are made outcasts from groups because they are seen as ‚Äútoo feminine‚Äù. In this way patriarchal culture simultaneously outcasts male Machi but also reinforces stereotypes that males are more powerful than females. As a result many male Machi have reinvented themselves as ‚Äúcelibate priests‚Äù or ‚Äúspiritual warriors‚Äù in order to avoid further criticism and protect their masculinity. In some healing ceremonies and rituals male Machis are not permitted to participate because ‚Äúthey are not close enough to nature‚Äù and ‚Äú[women] are more patient with the sick and know more about herbs‚Ä¶the spirits get along with women better‚Äù. Therefore, patriarchal culture works in multiple ways. It leads to discrimination and misogyny against male and female machi and also creates complicated power dynamics where in some circles women are perceived as inferior and in other circles perceived as more powerful. Machi women are sometimes out-casted from traditional Mapuche gender roles. Machi women are revered and feared. Masculine female machi are called derogatory terms such as bruja (witch) mujer de la calle (woman of the street) or marica (derogatory term of homosexual). One Machi describes that Machi women are given a higher status than Mapuche women because ‚Äúthey are sent here [earth] by god‚Äù and are therefore divine. She says for example ‚Äúshe is served before other people [at meals]‚Äù. In this way the Machi regulate their own gender norms but are also combatted with traditional gender norms of Mapuche and Chilean society. This further complicates the notion of gender within the society. Gender in Machi culture is filled with contradictions, paradoxes, and complications because they simultaneously exist within the gender binary and defy it. ‚ÄúWhereas male Machi legitimate their sexuality as celibate priests, most female Machi gain status and virtue by marrying and having children‚Äù. Thus Machi still abide by the gender roles and norms of Mapuche culture, but then fight against them during spiritual ceremonies and rituals where they challenge traditional roles and perceptions of gender and embrace cogendered identities. The gender identity and construction of the Machi is nuanced and complex. Machi are able to fluidly move between genders throughout different ceremonies, but then face discrimination from Chilean society and fellow Machis themselves. One Machi states, ‚ÄúHere people don‚Äôt talk much about homosexuality because it is looked down upon‚Äù. Some Machis are concerned about the way the West portrays Machis, afraid that they are only perceived as homosexuals or brujas ‚Äúwitches‚Äù. One Machi states ‚ÄúWhy do anthropologists always say who we are? Why don‚Äôt they ask us?‚Äù Ana Bacigalupo, a distinguished anthropologist in the field of Machi gender roles, urges people to see the nuances in Machi gender identity and allow complexity to exist.‚Äù Machis gendered identities and practices can be experienced and interpreted endlessly along different paths and for different purposes that simultaneously bind people together and draw them apart‚Äù Controversy A modern ritual human sacrifice occurred during the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 1960 by a machi of the Mapuche in the Lago Budi community.Patrick Tierney, The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice (1989) The victim, five-year-old Jos√© Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pa√±√°n and Juan Jos√© Painecur (the victim's grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the Pacific Ocean then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumored to be at the behest of the local machi, Juana Namuncur√° A√±en. The two men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after two years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had \\"acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition.\\" The arrested men's explanation was: \\"We were asking for calm in the sea and on the earth.\\"\\"Asking for Calm.\\" Time Magazine. 4 July 1960 (retrieved 28 June 2011) See also *Kalku *Kallawaya *Medicine man *Lonko *Toqui *Warlock of Chilo√©  Notes  References  *Ana Mariella Bacigalupo.

They changed their name to the Esher Kangaroos for the 1992 season, then to the Firkin Roos for the 1996‚Äì97 seasons, then folded after the 1997 season. They appeared in the inaugural Grand Final in 1990 and were defeated by the Wandsworth Demons. They returned to the next Grand Final in 1991 and defeated the Wandsworth Demons by the biggest winning margin in the history of BARFL Grand Finals. This was probably the highlight of the Roos existence, although former players attempted to get the club back on a sound footing, managed mainly under the guidance of Craig 'Howie' Howard. After the semi-final defeat in 1997, Howard decided he couldn't carry on with the clubs and decided to leave for Canada, where he helped coach an AFL club there.

Prior to becoming the head coach at Utah, Whittingham served as Utah's defensive coordinator for ten seasons. He was named head coach of Utah after Urban Meyer left for the Florida Gators in 2004. He won AFCA Coach of the Year and the Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award in 2008. Playing career Whittingham played linebacker for the BYU Cougars from 1978 to 1981. In 1981, he earned first-team all-WAC and WAC Defensive Player of the Year honors. Whittingham was also named the defensive MVP of the 1981 Holiday Bowl. He played in all of the first four Holiday Bowls. In his first appearance, he played as a running back and the other three as a linebacker, during which he recorded 27 tackles. In 2009, he was inducted into the Holiday Bowl Hall of Fame. He graduated from BYU in 1981 and went on to play linebacker for the Denver Gold and New Orleans Breakers of the USFL and the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL. He also played for the Los Angeles Rams' replacement squad in 1987. Coaching career=Early coaching career Whittingham became a graduate assistant for BYU during the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In 1987, Whittingham was named defensive coordinator at the College of Eastern Utah. He coached there for a season before taking a job at Idaho State. After five seasons with Idaho State, Whittingham joined the Utah staff as defensive line coach, working alongside his father, Fred Whittingham. In the 1995 season, Whittingham replaced his father as the defensive coordinator, serving under both Ron McBride and Meyer until being named head coach in 2004. Head coaching career The 2004 season ended with Utah becoming the first BCS non-AQ conference team to make a BCS bowl game, the Fiesta Bowl. After winning the Fiesta Bowl, the Utes' overall record improved to 12‚Äì0. After the 2004 season, the Utes lost junior starting quarterback Alex Smith to the NFL and head coach Urban Meyer who left to the University of Florida. After the regular season, and before the Fiesta Bowl, Whittingham was offered the head coaching job at Utah and also the head coaching job at his alma mater, Brigham Young University. After struggling with the decision for four days he chose the Utes. Because Urban Meyer had already officially accepted the head coaching job at Florida before the Fiesta Bowl, Whittingham and Meyer acted as co-head coaches of the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. Utah and the NCAA credit the Fiesta Bowl to both Meyer and Whittingham. =2005= Whittingham's first season was an up and down ride for Utah as the team not only adjusted to a new coaching staff, including Andy Ludwig, but also a new offense led by quarterback Brian Johnson. Utah struggled early on, going 3‚Äì4 in their first 7 games, however, a strong finish gave Utah their third straight bowl invite. In the 2005 Emerald Bowl the Utes faced the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Utah beat Georgia Tech 38‚Äì10, the Yellow Jackets' worst bowl loss by point margin in school history. Whittingham finished his first year at Utah with a 7‚Äì5 record. =2006= In 2006, Whittingham's team faced a degree of adversity. Starting quarterback Brett Ratliff struggled through parts of the year, and so did the Utes. Like the year before, the Utes rebounded toward the end of the season, but lost to rival BYU at home by a score of 33‚Äì31. The Utes became bowl eligible for the fourth straight year, a school record. Whittingham led the Utes to a 25‚Äì13 victory over the University of Tulsa in the 2006 Armed Forces Bowl, running his record to 15‚Äì10 (.600) with Utah. =2007= 2007 would provide more adversity. In Johnson's first start since 2005, he broke his collarbone against Oregon State and starting running back Matt Asiata broke his leg as Utah got routed 24‚Äì7 by the Beavers. The following week, wide receiver Brent Casteel was lost for the season in an embarrassing 20‚Äì12 loss at home to Air Force. Utah looked as if it righted the ship the following week with a 44‚Äì6 rout of No. 9 UCLA, the highest-ranked team ever defeated by the Utes. But the following week represented the worst week of Whittingham's head coaching career‚Äîa 27‚Äì0 loss to perennial cellar-dweller UNLV that had many wondering if Whittingham could survive as a head coach at Utah. But like past seasons, the Utes regrouped and won seven consecutive games, using a stingy, big-play defense and the sledgehammer running attack of Darrell Mack (253 carries, 1,204 yards and 16 total touchdowns), who had been scheduled to redshirt in what was going to be his junior season. The Utes 50‚Äì0 drubbing of Wyoming proved controversial. Up 43‚Äì0 in the second half, Whittingham decided to go for an onside kick. An emotional Joe Glenn was caught on camera giving Whittingham the bird after the play. In the season finale, Utah suffered its second consecutive loss to rival BYU to end the regular season, 17‚Äì10. Whittingham and Utah overcame that disappointment to beat Navy, 35‚Äì32, in the 2007 Poinsettia Bowl. It marked the Utes' seventh consecutive bowl victory, which placed them second to Boston College in longest active bowl winning streaks. =2008= In 2008, Utah completed an undefeated regular season and qualified for the 2009 Sugar Bowl. Along the way were wins at Michigan, late come-from-behind wins over Oregon State and TCU, and a convincing victory over rival BYU. Overall, Utah finished the regular season holding wins over three teams in the final AP Top 25. Utah defeated Alabama, 31‚Äì17, in the Sugar Bowl, completing the fifth undefeated and untied season in school history. The American Football Coaches Association selected Whittingham as the 2008 AFCA National Coach of the Year Award. The announcement was made at the football coaches' convention, which Whittingham attended. The AFCA award is the oldest national coach of the year award, dating back to 1935, and is the only one chosen exclusively by the coaches. He also won the 2008 Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award. The team was selected national champion by Anderson & Hester, MCFR, and W postseason polls. =2009= In 2009, Utah had its second consecutive 10-win season. They finished with a 10‚Äì3 (6‚Äì2 MWC) record and a 37‚Äì27 win over California in the 2009 Poinsettia Bowl. Whittingham helped the Utes reach these benchmarks with two new coordinators: Dave Schramm as the offensive coordinator and Kalani Sitake as the defensive coordinator. Utah's three losses came against teams that finished the season ranked: Oregon, TCU, and BYU who finished the season ranked No. 11, 6, and 12 in the AP Poll, respectively. Utah finished ranked No. 18 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. =2010= Kyle Whittingham turned down the head coaching position at Tennessee early in 2010. Utah started the 2010 season with an upset of then-15th ranked Pittsburgh. The Utes then managed the third 8‚Äì0 start in program history, rising to fifth in the BCS rankings. However, during a 68‚Äì27 victory over Iowa State, Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn injured his arm and though he continued to play, the injury impacted the remainder of the season. After that 8‚Äì0 start, the Utes stumbled badly at home against the TCU Horned Frogs, lost a sloppy contest to Notre Dame and then bounced back to end the regular season with victories over San Diego State and rival Brigham Young University. Due to the injury, Wynn, who finished the regular season in spite of his injury, missed the Las Vegas Bowl ‚Äì a 26‚Äì3 loss to the Boise State Broncos. It was the program's first bowl loss since the 1996 Copper Bowl and snapped a 9-game bowl winning streak, which was, at the time, the longest active streak in college football. The Utes finished the 2010 campaign 10‚Äì3 and 23rd in the nation. It marked the first time in program history that Utah produced three consecutive ten-win seasons. =2011= In its inaugural season in the Pac-12 Conference, Utah finished with an 8‚Äì5 record (4‚Äì5 Pac-12). 2016 On January 29, 2016, The University of Utah announced Whittingham had agreed to a contract extension through the 2020 season. The contract will pay Whittingham $3.3 million per year. This came on the heels of Whitthingham surging past McBride to become the second-winningest coach in school history, behind only Ike Armstrong.

( ) was an English Franciscan scholar. His scholastic epithet was ''''' (Latin for \\"Most Aristotelian among the Aristotelians\\"), referring to his stature among the Scholastics during the Recovery of Aristotle amid the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance. He acquired fame as a lecturer at the University of Paris and also as a preacher when he entered the Order of Friars Minor, probably in 1224 or 1225. He served as the Minister Provincial for England (1239‚Äì1240) and as the Minister General of the Order (1240‚Äì). Life Haymo was born in Faversham, Kent. Thomas of Ecclestone tells us that he entered after having a vision of himself praying in the church in Faversham before the crucifix. A cord was lowered from heaven and he was drawn up to heaven by it. When Haymo saw the Friars Minor he recognised the cord and, after having asked the advice of the Dominican Master General Jordan of Saxony, Haymo and three others entered the Friars Minor at St. Denis, just outside Paris, on Good Friday after having preached the Good Friday sermon. Shortly after this he was appointed custos at Paris, in which capacity he seems to have attended the general chapter of the order at Assisi in 1230, and was one of the deputies sent by the chapter to Pope Gregory IX to petition for an explanation of certain points in the rule about which there had arisen some discussion in the order. The pope replied with the celebrated Bull \\"Quo elongati\\" of 28 September 1230. After this chapter Haymo probably went to England, for from a mention of him in the Patent Rolls Henrici III\\" he seems to have been at Oxford in 1232, probably as a lecturer in the Franciscan school there. In 1233 he was one of the Friars Minor sent by the Holy See to Constantinople to negotiate for the reunion of the Latin and Greek Churches. He led a peculiarly active life, for during these years he not only lectured at Oxford, but also at Tours, Bologna, and Padua. He was, moreover, employed by Gregory IX in revising the Breviary of the Roman Curia, and the edition published in 1241 of this Breviary (which afterwards was ordered to be used in all the Roman churches and eventually, with some modification, became the Breviary of the whole Catholic Church) was chiefly the work of Haymo (cf. trans. of Pierre Batiffol, \\"Hist. of the Roman Breviary\\", p. 213). In 1239 he took part in the general chapter of the order held at Rome when the notorious Elias of Cortona was deposed from the office of general. From Thomas of Eccleston's account of this chapter it appears that Haymo was one of the chief spokesmen against Elias. He also brought about the degradation of Gregory of Naples, a lieutenant of Elias and a nephew of the pope. After the deposition of Elias, Albert of Pisa, Provincial of England, was elected general, and Haymo succeeded him in the English provincialate. Albert, however died during the first year of his generalate, and Haymo was then elected to the supreme office in the order. According to Luke Wadding, Haymo was elected general in 1239, but this is an evident error. Eccleston expressly says that Haymo, while Provincial of England, gave the habit of the order to Ralph of Maidstone, Bishop of Hereford; but Ralph only resigned his bishopric on December 17, 1239; Haymo, therefore, could not have been elected general of the order until 1240. While Minister Provincial for England, he reversed the work of the earlier ministers who had kept the order humbly equipped and situated. Instead, he began to enlarge the Order's lands‚Äîparticularly around Oxford's College of the Franciscans outside the old wall's Watergate‚Äîso that the friars would be able to work for their own sustenance instead of depending on charity. Haymo at once set about rectifying the disorders caused among the friars by Elias. The latter had increased the number of provinces in the order to seventy-two, \\"after the manner of the seventy-two disciples\\", says Eccleston, and because he wished to rival the Dominicans, who had divided their order into twelve provinces in honor of the twelve Apostles. Haymo reduced the number of provinces. As Elias had found his chief supporters amongst the lay brothers, whom he had attached to his person by promoting them to high places, Haymo decreed that in future no lay brother should be appointed superior except when there were no priests to fill the office. He also defined the rights of superiors, and set their jurisdiction within definite bounds. Although very zealous for the poverty of the rule, he yet was aware of the disadvantages of depending too much on alms, preferring that the friars live by their own labours. Thus, when Provincial of England, he obtained several larger grounds for the friars, so they could cultivate land. That way, they could supply themselves with food, and not have to beg. He died at Anagni in Italy . On his death-bed, says Eccleston, he was visited by Pope Innocent IV; but Innocent IV was at Anagni only from 25 June until the middle of October, 1243, and during the whole of 1244 was resident at Rome. Haymo's epitaph runs: \\"Here lies Haymo, highest glory of the English; in his living a brother [friar] of the Minors, in ruling them a father; an eminent lecturer, and rector general in his order.\\" As a schoolman he was styled, in the fashion of the time, Speculum honestatis. Besides his lectures on the Sentences he left a treatise on the ceremonies of the Mass and a book of sermons.

It runs from U.S. Route 5 (US 5) in Rockingham in the east to US 7 in Clarendon near Rutland in the west. The Vermont Country Store's second branch is one attraction along the route, as well as the Okemo Ski Resort in Ludlow. Route description VT 103 is a major arterial road for Vermont, being the most direct path from Boston and southeastern New England to Rutland and the Green Mountains ski areas and attractions. Although U.S. Route 4 is a shorter and slightly better road across the Green Mountains to Rutland, it is a direct east-west road intersecting Interstate 91 significantly north of the diagonal 103. Numerous proposals to widen 103 into a two-lane freeway or similar limited-access roadway have failed, even though a substantial power company right of way shadows the road for much of its length. Vermont Country Store location on VT 103 VT 103 begins at U.S. Route 5 in Rockingham just east of Interstate 91 and just north of Bellows Falls. From there, it interchanges with I-91 at exit 6 and proceeds northeast to a pair of intersections with Meetinghouse Road, a loop road connecting VT 103 to the Rockingham Meetinghouse. Farther northwest, the route passes by one of Vermont Country Store's two locations and intersects Williams Road and Lower Bartonsville Road, a pair of local roads leading to the Worrall Covered Bridge and the Bartonsville Covered Bridge, respectively. VT 103 continues as a wide sweeping road into Chester, Windsor County, where it briefly overlaps VT 11 and crosses the Williams River on a new bridge. Ludlow Baptist Church and Black River Academy Just north of Chester, VT 103 passes through Stone Village, an area listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Here, houses made of local granite line both sides of VT 103. Outside of Stone Village, the road varies from a narrow and winding shoulder-less 2-lane between the river and mountains to a more wide-shouldered road. This variation remains until the village of Ludlow, where the route passes by the Ludlow Baptist Church and the Black River Academy near the village green. A few blocks to the west, VT 103 intersects VT 100 and joins VT 100 north past the Okemo Ski Resort into the town of Ludlow, where the concurrency ends roughly north of the village. While VT 100 continues north and parallels the county line, VT 103 turns west and crosses into Rutland County. Across the county line in Mount Holly, VT 103 passes within a few miles of the Crowley Cheese factory as it heads into the Shrewsbury village of Cuttingsville with even more variations in road quality. Outside Cuttingsville, it proceeds through Clarendon, where it crosses over the conjoined Long and Appalachian Trails and intersects Airport and East Clarendon Roads, two local roadways leading, respectively, to the Kingsley and Brown Covered Bridges. Shortly after the junction with East Clarendon Road, VT 103 intersects VT 7B, the former routing of U.S. Route 7, before terminating at modern US 7 adjacent to the Rutland Airport, just south of Rutland.

The museum houses collection that currently numbers nearly 36,000 artworks and artifacts in all media. The collection spans the history of European and American art from ancient to contemporary, and includes broad holdings of East Asian art. Areas of special strength include medieval art; European and American paintings, sculpture and prints; photography; Japanese Edo period painting and prints; 20th-century Chinese painting; and KU‚Äôs ethnographic collection, which includes about 10,000 Native American, African, Latin American and Australian works.  History  In 1917 Sallie Casey Thayer, a Kansas City art collector, offered her collection of nearly 7,500 art objects to the University of Kansas to form a museum \\"to encourage the study of fine arts in the Middle West.\\" Her eclectic collection included paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, furniture, rugs, textiles, metalwork, ceramics, glass, and other examples of decorative arts, primarily from Europe and Asia. Eventually the University of Kansas Museum of Art was established in 1928, based on this collection. By the late 1960s the Museum had outgrown its quarters in Spooner Hall. Helen Foresman Spencer, another Kansas City collector and patron of the arts, made a gift of $4.6 million that funded construction of a new museum, overseen by Charles C. Eldredge, a former curator and director of the museum. The building housing the Helen Foresman Spencer Museum of Art, the Kress Foundation Department of Art History, and the Murphy Library of Art and Architecture opened in 1978. The neo-classical structure, built from Indiana limestone, was designed by Kansas City architect Robert E. Jenks, a 1926 graduate of KU. In 2007, the Spencer Museum grew again when approximately 9,500 ethnographic collection objects from the former University of Kansas Museum of Anthropology were transferred to the Spencer Museum of Art. The collection includes a wide variety of cultural materials from all around the world, with a particular emphasis on American Indian materials. The collection is still housed in Spooner Hall and the storage space has been upgraded to include specially designed cabinets to house and protect the collection. In 2016 the first phase of a major renovation project was completed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The works covered 30,000 square feet of the building and, according to the architects, added features that: > \\"infuse the building with natural light, connecting art and nature with > breathtaking views into historic Marvin Grove. A glass-enclosed entry and > new windows on the east and west bring natural light into the galleries for > the first time. A new staircase and elevator improve circulation, while > balcony overlooks offer glimpses from one gallery into another. An expanded > study center and teaching gallery accommodate temporary installations and > up-close investigations of objects in the collection.\\" The museum has received grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support interdisciplinary research, first $487,000 in 2016 to launch the program, and a second round of funding of $650,000 in 2019.  Mission  The Spencer Museum of Art sustains a diverse collection of art and works of cultural significance. It encourages interdisciplinary exploration at the intersections of art, ideas and experience. Among its collections are items from the estate of local literary icon William S. Burroughs, e.g., a Dreamachine fabricated by David Woodard. According to the Spencer Museum of Art's webpage, the museum strives to strengthen, support, and contribute to the academic research and teaching of the University of Kansas, and it is committed to serving communities of learners across Kansas and beyond.

It centers around four kids from Beverly Hills who form a ruthless gang. The entire film features Steve's (Woodrow) feeble attempts to obtain Heather Smith (Hilton) as his girlfriend, and a ruthless rebel child with some clear psychological disorders named Duff and his friend T trying to earn respect in their gang. Plot The film follows the experiences of a promising athlete named Steve and his friends who live in a small southern California town. Steve's three friends, Duff, Seb, and T, all come from wealthy families and spend most of their time getting high, drinking at parties, and harassing Ahkmed, a convenience store clerk. After finding a gun in a girl's house, Duff starts violently pursuing a life of crime with T, the loudmouthed instigator with a Napoleon complex, at his side. After Duff kills a kid who volunteers at the police department, the story fades away and we come back to find Steve returning home from college a year later just after being successful in college baseball. Steve came back to get his dream girl, Heather Smith, who told him that if he made it as a baseball player she would consider dating him. Steve runs into Duff's gang. Things spiral out of control for Steve as we learn that Duff and T have become submerged in what they think is one of the hardest gangs ever. In fact, shortly after Steve joins up with Duff and T, he witnesses them kill a man in broad daylight in the middle of the street over $80. As the story unfolds, it is clear that Heather is being used and abused by her new boyfriend Todd, whom she is reluctant to leave for Steve. Later Steve convinces Seb, who broke his ties with Duff's crew, to come out and party with Duff and the old gang for a night. T insults two Korean men by calling them Gooks, who then fire an Uzi into Duff's car, killing Seb. Duff and T were later sold out to a crooked undercover cop and the older brother of the man who was previously shot over $80. They killed T and then a narcotics officer, and his team busted the door down and were all killed. The end of the movie has Steve and Duff driving along the street when a couple of young kids throw something at Duff's car causing the two get to out of the car and chase after them.

Rabbinical eras; eras of the Halakha Chazal are generally divided according to their era and the main writing done in that era:http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=3917 * Soferim (\\"scribes\\"): Sages from before the era of Ezra the scribe until the Zugot era, including the men of the Great Assembly. This era stretches from the Matan Torah (\\"giving of the Law\\"; Moses receiving the Torah on Biblical Mount Sinai), to the Halakha (\\"traditions\\") era, including the times of Simeon the Just. * Zugot (\\"pairs\\"): Five pairs (zugot) of sages from consecutive generations, who lived during a period of around 100 years towards the end of the Second Temple era. (142 BCE ‚Äì ' 40 BCE) * Tannaim (\\"teachers\\"): Refers to the sages of the Mishnah, who lived in the Land of Israel until 220 CE. In addition to the Mishnah, their writings were preserved in the Midrash. Key figures among the Tannaim include Hillel the Elder, Rabbi Akiva, and Judah haNasi. * Amoraim (\\"expounders\\"): Refers to the sages of the Talmud who were active during the end of the era of the sealing of the Mishnah, and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220 CE ‚Äì 500 CE). The Amoraim sages were active in two areas, the Land of Israel, and Babylon. In addition to the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, their writings were preserved in midrashs such as Midrash Rabba. * Savoraim (\\"reasoners\\"): Refers to the sages of Beth midrash (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the Geonim (from the end of the 6th century or the midst of the 7th century). Chazal's authority Until the end of the Savoraim era, Chazal had the authority to comment on the Torah according to the Talmudical hermeneutics standards required by the Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai \\"◊î◊ú◊õ◊î ◊ú◊û◊©◊î ◊û◊°◊ô◊†◊ô\\" (Hebrew wikipedia); Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai, Jewish Virtual Library (The unwritten laws believed to have been given to Moses at Sinai), sometimes even expounding a word or phrase outside its plain and ordinary sense. Nowadays in Orthodoxy, this authority is not delegated to the current generation's sages, and thus the Torah can not be commentated on, in matters concerning the halakha (\\"tradition\\"), if it contradicts Chazal's commentary. Until the middle of the Tannaim era, when there was a Sanhedrin (a High Court of Jewish law), Chazal had also the authority to decree restrictions and to enact new religious regulations, in any matter they saw fit, concerning issues that were not included in the written Torah, or were not delivered at Mount Sinai. These rabbinical mitzvot (\\"commandments\\") include the holidays of Purim and Hanukkah, the laws of muktzah (\\"set-aside items\\") on Shabbat, the ritual washing of one's hands (netilat yadayim) before eating bread, the construction of eruvim (liminal gateways), and the institution of the current schedule of daily prayer services ‚Äì shacharit (morning prayer), mincha (afternoon prayer), and ma'ariv (evening prayer).

This is achieved by giving scheduling priority to the least \\"expensive\\" data flows in terms of consumed network resources per transferred amount of information. In advanced packet radio systems, for example the HSDPA 3.5G cellular system, channel-dependent scheduling is used instead of FIFO queuing to take advantage of favourable channel conditions to make best use of available radio conditions. Maximum throughput scheduling may be tempting in this context, especially in simulations where throughput of various schemes are compared. However, maximum throughput scheduling is normally not desirable, and channel-dependent scheduling should be used with care, as we will see below.  Cost function in wireless packet radio systems = Example 1: Link adaptation  In a wireless network with link adaptation, and without co-channel interference from nearby wireless networks, the bit rate depends heavily on the carrier to noise ratio (CNR), which depends on the attenuation on the link between the transmitter and receiver, i.e. the path loss. For maximum throughput scheduling, links that are affected by low attenuation should be considered as inexpensive, and should be given scheduling priority.  Example 2: Spread spectrum  In the uplink of a spread spectrum cellular system, the carrier- to-interference ratio (CIR) is held constant by the power control for all users. For a user that suffers from high path loss, the power control will cause high interference level to signals from other users. This will prevent other more efficient data flows, since there is a maximum allowed interference level in the cell, and reduce the throughput. Consequently, for maximum throughput scheduling, data flows that suffer from high path loss should be considered as the most expensive, also in this case.  Example 3: Dynamic channel allocation  In wireless network with fast dynamic channel allocation (DCA), on a packet-by-packet or slot-by-slot basis, a user that is situated in the overlap between the coverage areas of several base stations would cause, or would be affected by, interference to/from nearby cells. The DCA algorithm would prevent the nearby cells from using the same frequency channel simultaneously. The cost function would correspond to the number of blocked nearby base station sites.  Comparison with other resource sharing policies  If there are large differences between the \\"cost\\" of each data flow, which is the case especially in wireless networking, resources may be assigned to only one or very few data flows per physical channel in the network. If there are many simultaneously active data flows, a majority of the data flows will have to wait until the most inexpensive flows have no more data to transfer, and will suffer from scheduling starvation. A maximum throughput scheduling policy may be tempting since it would optimize the resource utilization in a given network, but it would not be likely to maximize profit for the network operator. The levels of customer satisfaction would remain low due to many customers experiencing long or permanent service outages. Proportional fairness would result in lower throughput, but starvation would be avoided. Max-min fairness would result in even lower throughput, but higher level of fairness, meaning that the service quality that each data flow achieves would be even more stable. Unlike max-min fair scheduling based on the fair queuing or round robin algorithms, a maximum throughput scheduling algorithm relies on the calculation of a cost function, which in wireless networks may require fast and truthful measurement of the path loss. Proportional fairness based on weighted fair queuing also require measurement or calculation of the cost function.

The station's studios are located in Northeast Oklahoma City and a transmitter site is located a mile east from the studio. History The station began broadcasting in 1965 in Oklahoma City and was known by the call letters KOFM. It signed on the air as a beautiful music station and the home for the Indian Nations News Network (INN). During the early 1970s, KOFM Fresh Air adopted a unique format programmed by John Hendrix (formerly OKC's KOCY FM Underground) and the later VP of Programming for the FOX Talk Radio Network- Mike Elder. The format provided a unique progressive rock sound that included rock album cuts, special interrelated song sets, and was called \\"Fresh Air Radio\\" years before NPR's usage of the same name. KOFM's Fresh Air format was similar to KBCO FM in Boulder, Colorado. Later, with new American Media Ownership, KOFM tried to duplicate AM Top 40 with an FM top 40 hit station programmed by Mike Miller, John Jenkins and Charlie Cooper and used the positioning statement \\"Rockin' With The Hits\\". On June 2, 1986, KOFM became KMGL and changed formats to Transtar's Format 41. Over time KMGL became a fully live adult contemporary formatted station under the direction of PD and morning personality Steve O'Brien. KMGL has been one of Oklahoma City's top rated stations since the mid 1980s. Today, the KOFM call letters are now used by a station in Enid, Oklahoma. Ownership changes On July 15, 2012, Ty and Tony Tyler's Tyler Media entered into an agreement with Renda Broadcasting to purchase that company's Oklahoma City radio cluster (KMGL, KOMA, KRXO and KOKC) for $40 million. In accordance to limits imposed by the Federal Communications Commission on the number of radio stations a single broadcasting entity can own in a single market, Tyler sold KTLR and KKNG to WPA Radio for $1.6 million.Is Renda Cashing Out? , RadioInk, July 16, 2012.In Oklahoma City, Tyler spins two so it can buy four from Renda (for $40M) , RadioInfo, July 16, 2012.

In 2006 KMGL would flip to all-Christmas music the following Monday after KQOB started Christmas music on the Friday before, since then KMGL has flipped to all- Christmas usually the week before Thanksgiving or the Friday after. KMGL usually has a good ratings following during this time. Oklahoma City's first radio station to do all-Christmas music was 97.7 KWHP during the 1960s followed by 94.7 KQSR starting on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

It is the first book in the Twilight series, and introduces seventeen-year-old Isabella \\"Bella\\" Swan, who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington. She is endangered after falling in love with Edward Cullen, a 108-year-old vampire frozen in his 17-year-old body. Additional novels in the series are New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. Twilight received lukewarm reviews. Some praised the novel's tone and its portrayal of common teenage emotions such as alienation and rebellion. Others criticized Meyer's prose and argued the story was lacking in character development. It reached number five on the New York Times bestseller list within a month of its release and eventually reached first place. The novel was named one of Publishers Weekly's Best Children's Books of 2005. The film adaptation, released in 2008, was a commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide and making an additional $157 million in North American DVD sales as of July 2009. The book was the biggest-selling of 2008; in 2009, it was the second-biggest selling, losing only to its sequel New Moon. As of 2008, Twilight has been translated into 37 different languages. In October 2015, Stephenie Meyer announced a new gender-swapped version of the novel, entitled Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, with characters Beau and Edythe, in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Twilight saga.New Twilight Book, New York Times Plot=Plot summary Bella Swan is a seventeen-year-old introvert girl who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula to live with her father, Charlie. Her mother, Ren√©e, is traveling with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, a minor league baseball player. Bella is admitted to Forks High School, where she easily befriends many of the students. A somewhat inexperienced and shy girl, Bella is dismayed by several boys competing for her attention. On the first day of her school, Edward Cullen, a mysterious and beautiful boy stares at Bella, frustrated. Bella sits next to Edward in biology class, but he seems to be utterly repulsed by her, much to her bewilderment. He disappears for a few days but when he returns, he is unexpectedly friendly to Bella. Their newfound relationship is interrupted after Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward saves Bella, narrowly stopping the van with his bare hands. Bella questions Edward about how he saved her life but he refuses to tell anything. During a campout, she meets Jacob Black, a local boy from the Quileute tribe. She learns from him that Edward and his family are actually vampires who consume only animal blood. Disturbed and riddled by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. She compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens. Convinced that he is a vampire, she finds herself in a state of enigma. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked by a group of men. Furious, Edward drives Bella away and takes her to a restaurant for dinner and then back home. On the way, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Seeing that there's no point denying, he agrees to it. He confesses that Bella's blood is more desirable to him than to any other vampire. He wanted to kill her on the first day of school. He tried to stay away so that he couldn't hurt her. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love. Their relationship is affected when a nomad vampire coven arrives in Forks. James, a tracker vampire, who is intrigued by Cullen's relationship with a human, wants to hunt Bella for sport. Bella and Edward are forced to separate as Bella escapes with Alice and Jasper (Edward's brother and sister), to hide in a hotel in Phoenix. James calls Bella and claims to be holding her mother hostage. Bella sneaks out and hurries to save her mother. When she arrives at the place, she finds that the hostage claim was a ruse. James attacks her, but before he can kill her, she is rescued by Edward and the other Cullens who kill James. However, James has already bitten Bella. Edward prevents her from becoming a vampire by sucking the venom out of her wound, and she is treated at a hospital, using the story that she fell out of a window as an excuse. After they return to Forks, Edward takes her to the school prom, as Edward did not want Bella to miss any normal human experience because of him. Bella says that she wants to become like him, a vampire, but Edward reiterates he is against this. Bella's desire to become a vampire increases throughout the series. Edward continues to refuse to turn her, as he thinks being a vampire is being a monster, and does not want Bella to suffer the same fate. Main characters * Isabella \\"Bella\\" Swan - A 17-year-old girl who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington to live with her father. Her mother moves to Florida with her second husband. Bella has a kind and awkward personality that is more mature than most girls her age. She is intelligent and observant, noticing and formulating theories about the Cullens' strange behaviors, physical features, and unusual abilities. As the novel progresses, Bella unconsciously learns how to make difficult choices and accept their consequences. * Edward Cullen - A 109-year-old vampire who was transformed by Carlisle Cullen when he was near death with Spanish flu in 1918. He has a supernatural gift for reading people's minds. Since Edward's transformation into a vampire, he had never fallen in love nor believed that he needed to. He later realizes that his existence was completely pointless and without an aim. In Bella he finds compassion, love, acceptance and care. In Twilight, Edward has a pessimistic personality influenced by Meyer's naturally pessimistic character.. His character was also influenced by Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre.. * James - A vampire with an unusual ability to track people. When the Cullens try to protect Bella, James figures she will be the biggest hunt of his life. * Jacob Black - A non-vampire, Quileute Indian who lives on the La Push reservation near Forks. Upon first meeting, Bella is charmed and impressed by Jacob in many ways. Jacob learns that he is similar to Bella in many ways. Her father Charlie sees that Jacob is safe boyfriend material, the kind of guy he would approve her dating. * Carlisle Cullen - A handsome, conscientious doctor. As patriarch of the Cullen clan, Carlisle started the practice of a 'vegetarian' (no human) diet. As a human in the 17th century, Carlisle was the son of an anti-'evil-being' pastor. Development Meyer claims that the idea for Twilight came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003. She dreamed of a human girl and a vampire who loved her but still wanted her blood. Inspired by her dream, Meyer wrote the draft of what is now Chapter 13 of the book. The first drafts were titled Forks instead of Twilight; the publisher requested the title change. At first, Meyer didn't name her two main characters. She chose Edward, influenced by Edward Rochester from Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre and Edward Ferrars from Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. She named the female lead Isabella, thinking she would have chosen that for a daughter. Rosalie and Jasper were originally named Carol and Ronald. Meyer continued writing to the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, she realized that she wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters by the time she was finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003. Her sister liked the book and encouraged Meyer to send the manuscript to literary agencies. Of the 15 letters she wrote, five went unanswered, nine brought rejections, and the last was a positive response from Jodi Reamer of Writers House. Meyer had merely sent out letters to literary agents inquiring if they would be interested in a 130,000-word manuscript about teenage vampires. Luck helped. An inexperienced assistant at Writers House responded to her inquiry, not knowing that young adult books are expected to be about 40,000 to 60,000 words in length. Due to that error, Reamer eventually read Meyer's manuscript and signed her up as a client. During the editing process, a chapter that used to be Chapter 20 was cut out of the manuscript along with Emmett's account of his bear attack and some parts of the epilogue. Cover Stephenie Meyer has said the apple on the cover represents the forbidden fruit from the Book of Genesis and Bella and Edward's forbidden love. She uses a quote from Genesis 2:17 at the beginning of the book. It also represents Bella's knowledge of good and evil, and the choices she makes. Meyer says, \\"It asks if you are going to bite in and discover the frightening possibilities around you or refuse and stay safe in the comfortable world you know.\\" An alternative cover features Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, the actors who play the lead characters in the film adaptation. Awards and honors * Among Publishers Weekly's \\"Best Children's Books of 2005\\" * Among School Library Journal's \\"Best Books of 2005\\" Publication Meyer's inquiry letter was initially rejected by 14 agents. Eight publishers competed for the rights to publish Twilight in the 2003 auction. Little, Brown and Company originally bid for $300,000, but Meyer's agent asked for $1 million; the publishers finally settled on $750,000 for three books. Twilight was published in 2005 with a print run of 75,000 copies. It debuted at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list within a month of its release, and later peaked at #1. Foreign rights to the novel were sold to over 26 countries. In October 2008, Twilight was ranked #26 in USA Today's list of \\"Bestselling Books of Last 15 Years\\". Later, the book went on to become the best-selling book of 2008. and the second biggest selling of 2009, only behind its sequel New Moon. For the tenth anniversary release Meyer released Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined alongside the original Twilight. Life and Death is a reimagining of the story with Beau (a male human) and Edythe (a female vampire) as the leads. Critical reception Initial reviews for Twilight were generally positive, with Publishers Weekly calling Meyer one of the most \\"promising new authors of 2005\\". The Times praised the book for capturing \\"perfectly the teenage feeling of sexual tension and alienation\\", and Amazon.com hailed the book as \\"deeply romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful\\". Hillias J. Martin of School Library Journal addresses the appeal of the novel to be due to its clear and understandable nature, allowing readers to become fully engaged Norah Piehl of TeenReads also wrote, \\"Twilight is a gripping blend of romance and horror\\". Publishers Weekly's starred review described Bella's \\"infatuation with outsider Edward\\", their risky relationship, and \\"Edward's inner struggle\\" as a metaphor for sexual frustration accompanying adolescence. Booklist wrote, \\"There are some flaws here‚Äìa plot that could have been tightened, an over reliance on adjectives and adverbs to bolster dialogue‚Äìbut this dark romance seeps into the soul.\\" Christopher Middleton of The Daily Telegraph called the book a \\"high school drama with a bloody twist ... no secret, of course, at whom this book is aimed, and no doubt, either, that it has hit its mark. Jennifer Hawes of The Post and Courier said, \\"Twilight, the first book in Stephenie Meyer's series, gripped me so fiercely that I called the nearest teenager I know and begged for her copy after I misplaced my own.\\" Roberta Goli of Suite101.com gave the novel a positive review, saying that while \\"the first half of the novel lacks action\\", the writing is \\"fluid\\" and the story \\"interesting\\". She also praised the depth of emotion shown between the main characters for pinpointing \\"the angst of teenage love.\\" Jana Reiss noted the presence of Mormon themes in the Twilight series, seeing Edward Cullen's struggle against carnal desires as an example of Mormonism's \\"natural man.\\" Kirkus gave a more mixed review, noting that, \\"[Twilight] is far from perfect: Edward's portrayal as monstrous tragic hero is overly Byronic, and Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character. Nonetheless, the portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot; fans of dark romance will find it hard to resist.\\" The New York Times review stated, \\"The premise of Twilight is attractive and compelling ‚Äî who hasn't fantasized about unearthly love with a beautiful stranger? ‚Äî but the book suffers at times from overearnest, amateurish writing. A little more \\"showing\\" and a lot less \\"telling\\" might have been a good thing, especially some pruning to eliminate the constant references to Edward's shattering beauty and Bella's undying love.\\" Although the Daily Telegraph later listed Twilight at number 32 on its list of \\"100 books that defined the noughties\\", it said that the novel was \\"Astonishing, mainly for the ineptitude of [Meyer's] prose\\". Elizabeth Hand said in a review for the Washington Post, \\"Meyer's prose seldom rises above the serviceable, and the plotting is leaden\\". Book challenges Twilight was on the American Library Association Top Ten List of the Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2010, for containing a \\"religious viewpoint\\" and \\"violence\\".. The Twilight series was on the same list in 2009 for being \\"sexually explicit\\", \\"unsuited to age group\\", and having a \\"religious viewpoint\\".. A New York City Psychologist addressed issues in the Twilight series and how it relates to women and expectations of healthy relationships versus illusion based relationships with her short film \\"Into The Twilight Haze\\".. The Marshall University Libraries also pinpoints areas wherein several schools have removed the novel off their shelves since its release. These Libraries mention the hyper-sexual nature of the novel, as well as the religious controversy within the plot. Acclaimed author and critic, Doctor Alyson Miller explains the skeptical nature of the church in regards to all controversial literature due to the inherent \\"impressionable\\" feature of the young demographic. Adaptations=Film Twilight was adapted as a film by Summit Entertainment. The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke and stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as protagonists Bella and Edward. The screenplay was adapted by Melissa Rosenberg. The movie was released in theaters in the United States on November 21, 2008, and on DVD on March 21, 2009. The DVD was released in Australia on April 22, 2009. Graphic novel On July 15, 2009, Entertainment Weekly confirmed rumors that a graphic novel adaptation of Twilight was in the works. The book was drawn by Korean artist Young Kim and published by Yen Press. Stephenie Meyer reviewed every panel herself. According to EW, \\"it doesn't look simply like an artist's rendering of Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson. In fact, the characters seem to be an amalgam of Meyer's literary imagination and the actors' actual looks.\\" EW magazine published finished illustrations of Edward, Bella, and Jacob in their July 17, 2009 issue.

Biography Hemenway was born in August 10, 1941 in Nebraska. He arrived at KU in 1995 as the successor to interim chancellor, Del Shankel. Prior to his tenure at KU, Hemenway served as chancellor of the University of Kentucky from 1989 to 1995 and Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Oklahoma from 1986 to 1989. Hemenway was succeeded as chancellor by Bernadette Gray-Little. In addition to his duties as chancellor, Hemenway served as Chair of the 18-member NCAA Division I board of directors from 2002 to 2005 and as a member of the Board of Directors of the American Council on Education. Starting in 2002, Hemenway served on the Board of Directors of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. Upon his arrival at KU, Hemenway prioritized making KU a Top 25 academic institution in America, which he continued at an even greater pace in more recent years. In 2007, KU ranked 88th according to the US News & World Report ranking of all national universities (public & private). During Hemenway's tenure, KU ranked as high as 30th (1998) in the US News & World Report ranking of public universities and was ranked 45th in 2005. KU ranks 3rd among public colleges and universities for the number of Academic All- Americans since 1990.

The film is also known as The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings, a literal translation of its original French title, Le battement d'ailes du papillon. The title references the butterfly effect from chaos theory which is quoted at greater length by one of the characters in the film. Synopsis Audrey Tautou plays shop assistant Ir√®ne, who on the way to work takes a seat on the Paris metro opposite an older woman who tries to interview her for a marketing survey. On hearing that Ir√®ne's birthdate is 11 March 1977, the woman reads her horoscope: today she'll meet her true love, but she must be patient. After she leaves the metro, a young man sitting alongside (Faudel) tells the older woman he was born on the same day and asks her to read the rest of the horoscope. The film then traces a range of characters of diverse ages, ethnicities and social status whose daily lives intersect with Ir√®ne and Faudel's in a variety of ways and come together at the end of the day. Seemingly trivial events‚Äîsuch as the throwing of stones or a shoe, the theft of a coffeemaker, a pigeon's consumption of a macaroon‚Äîdetermine the decisions and lives of the many characters. Cast * Audrey Tautou : Ir√®ne * Faudel : Youn√®s * √âric Savin : Richard * Fr√©d√©ric Bouraly : Bobby * Fran√ßoise Bertin : Luc's Grandmother * Pierre Bellemare : Taxi Driver Commentary The film relies heavily on the notion of chance and happenstance interacting in unpredictable ways on people's lives. It is a film whose action/plot appears heavily driven by the underlying chaos theory that gives the French film its title.

He was born in Suffolk County, New York. Life Post was born in Bayport, New York, the son of Albert Kintzing Post (1843-1872) and Marie Post (n√©e de Trobriand, 1845-1926). His maternal grandfather was R√©gis de Trobriand. He had an older sister, Lina Post Webster, and an older brother, Waldron Kintzing Post Sr. His father drowned at the age of 29 on Long Island when Regis was only two. His mother remarried to his father's 2nd cousin once removed, Charles Alfred Post (1844-1921). Regis had two step-sisters from this union, Beatrice Post Candler and Edith Post Gallatin. Post graduated from Harvard University in 1891 where he was a member of The Delphic Club. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Suffolk Co., 2nd D.) in 1899 and 1900. He was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt as Auditor of Puerto Rico in 1903, as Secretary of Puerto Rico in 1904, and as governor in 1907. Post held the office of governor from April 18, 1907 to November 5, 1909. His governorship was extremely controversial, as his frequent disagreements with the Puerto Rico Legislature led to the Legislature's failure to pass any budget in 1909, resulting in a political crisis on the island and passage of the Olmsted Amendment at the request of President William Howard Taft. Following Post's time in Puerto Rico, he worked with the American Ambulance Corps in France from 1913 to 1914. He joined the American Red Cross in 1917. Personal life He married Carolyn Beatrice Post, daughter of Colonel Henry A. V. Post and his 2nd cousin once removed, on March 6, 1895. They had a son, Regis Henri Post Jr.(February 17, 1897). In 1916, Post was discovered by his wife having an affair and they separated. She filed for divorce in 1922. He married Leila Ellis in 1925. She died in 1931. Post married thirdly Marguerite Denis de Lagarde on April 5, 1933. She was his distant cousin. Marguerite's great-niece through her sister was Mimi Lee. Death Regis Post died October 5, 1944 in Nantucket, Massachusetts at the age of 74. He left behind his wife, Marguertie, and his son, Regis H. Post, Jr. Relations Regis was part of the Post political family. His great-great-grandfather was Jotham Post, Jr., a United States Representative from New York and an assemblyman. His nephew was New York State assemblyman Langdon Post, and his distant cousin was New York State assemblyman Erastus F. Post. His sister, Lina Post Webster, married Hamilton Fish Webster, a grandson of Hamilton Fish. His step-sister, Edith Post Gallatin, married Goelet Gallatin, a great-grandson of Albert Gallatin, great-grandson of Elbridge Gerry, and first cousin of Peter Goelet Gerry.

The technique was developed by Walt Wright, a long time beekeeper from Tennessee.Web links to all articles written by Walt Wright, accessed June 2006Wright, Walt ; Swarm Prevention Alternative ‚Äì Checkerboarding Results and Conclusions 1996, Elkton, Tennessee Checkerboarding takes advantage of the bee colony's primary motivation, which is survival as survival of the existing colony takes priority over swarm preparation and swarming. Bees will not prepare for a reproductive swarm if they perceive the survival of the existing colony might be jeopardized. It is hypothesized that swarm preparation starts in the late winter. The over- wintering colony consumes honey and expands the brood volume. At this point, the bee colony apparently senses that it has enough remaining honey stores and a large enough brood nest to risk swarm preparation. The bee colony's first activity of swarm preparation is to reduce the brood volume by creating additional stores inside the brood area. As brood emerges, selected cells are back-filled with honey, nectar, or pollen. Later into the season, as space for egg laying decreases the queen will not be able to lay as many eggs. This forces the queen to diet and lose weight so she becomes fit for the swarm flight. Apparently, at the first time this type of backfilling behavior starts is the best time to do the Checkerboarding intervention. It requires filling two hive boxes above the broodnest each alternately with capped honey-filled frames and empty drawn frames. Alternating empty drawn combs above the brood nest \\"fools\\" the bees into thinking they don't have enough stores yet for swarming and causes them to expand the brood nest, giving both a bigger field force and avoiding reproductive swarming. Timing the checkerboarding intervention is very important (note that all these times are different reference points that refer to the same time in the United States). The best time for the intervention is: * at the time the elm trees bloom * four weeks before the maple trees bloom * five weeks before redbud trees bloom * eight weeks before the start of the apple tree blossom * nine weeks before the peak of the apple tree blossom  Sources  * Category:Beekeeping ","title":"Checkerboarding (beekeeping)"},{"id":"4451352","text":"Vermont Route 11 (VT 11) is a east‚Äìwest state highway in Vermont, United States. The western end of the highway is at VT 7A in Manchester. The eastern end is at the New Hampshire border at the Cheshire Bridge over the Connecticut River, connecting Springfield and Charlestown, New Hampshire. The route continues into New Hampshire as New Hampshire Route 11, and then following that into Maine as Maine State Route 11. The three Routes 11, totaling in length, were once part of the New England Interstate system. Route description View east along VT 11 at its split from VT 30 in Winhall VT 11 begins as Depot Street at an intersection with VT 7A and VT 30 in Manchester Center within the Batten Kill river valley at the edge of the Green Mountains. It proceeds eastward across railroad tracks and the US 7 expressway, intersecting it at Exit 4. VT 11 and VT 30 then proceed northeast and east following along the path of Bromley Brook for another five miles (8 km) into the northern edge of the town of Winhall, where VT 30 then separates to the southeast. VT 11 continues on its eastward track, passing through the Big Bromley Ski Area and town center of Peru, on its way to the town center of Londonderry. In Londonderry center, VT 11 is known as North Main Street and has a junction and short overlap with VT 100. VT 11 continues past Londonderry center, passing by the Magic Mountain Ski Area, towards the village of North Windham. From here, VT 11 turns northward, entering the town of Andover, following the path of the Middle Branch Williams River. VT 11 follows the river for about eight miles (13 km), as it turns eastward again in the village of Simonsville and continues towards the town center of Chester. In Chester center, VT 11 runs along Main Street, South Main Street, and Pleasant Street, overlapping with VT 103. After crossing the main Williams River, VT 11 heads east for three miles (5 km) then enters the town of Springfield. Within the urban compact of Springfield, VT 11 uses Chester Road, River Street, Main Street, and Clinton Street. VT 11 continues past the urban area following the Black River towards the Connecticut River as a 4 lane, undivided surface arterial. About a mile before reaching the Connecticut River, VT 11 is joined by U.S. Route 5 for about , with an interchange with I-91. After US 5 separates, VT 11 continues east for another , reverting to 2 lanes, one each way, before ending at the Cheshire Bridge at the New Hampshire state line. The road continues into New Hampshire as New Hampshire Route 11. History A portion of modern VT 11 in the town of Winhall was part of an early toll road known as the Peru Turnpike. 50px In 1922, the six New England states adopted a uniform road marking system that assigned route numbers from 1 to 99 for inter-state routes. VT 11 was originally assigned its designation as part of New England Interstate Route 11, which ran between New England Route 4 in Manchester, Vermont and New England Route 1 in Biddeford, Maine. Vermont formally established its state highway system in 1931, at which time the state took over maintenance of the western two-thirds of the route, between Manchester Center and Chester center, as well as the portion in Springfield along the Black River. The section from Chester center to Springfield center remained a town-maintained road until being transferred to the state in 1941. VT 11 was extended south from Manchester Center to the New York state line west of Arlington by 1938, replacing VT 123. The portion of VT 11 between the state line and Arlington was co-designated as VT 313 from New York to Arlington by 1940, leading to the truncation of VT 11 back to Manchester Center between 1947 and 1952.

History Tor Hansen started the label in 1997, two years after moving to North Carolina to help manage a chain of record stores in the South. He recruited his friend and former bandmate Glenn Dicker, with whom he had worked at Rounder Records. They made the decision to also start a distribution wing, Redeye. The first releases were local compilations, followed in subsequent years by records by H√ºsker D√º's Bob Mould, Marah, Dolorean, The Legendary Shack Shakers, Cities, Dave Alvin, and Los Straitjackets. The success of Los Straitjackets and the experience of working with Dicker on the Rounder-distributed Upstart convinced Nick Lowe to join Yep Roc. Scott McCaughey (The Minus 5, Young Fresh Fellows, The Baseball Project, The No Ones) joined the label because of Nick Lowe's presence, and has remained for almost a decade.

Route description The southern terminus of the route is at the Massachusetts state line in Stamford, where it continues south as Route 8\\\\. Its northern terminus is at VT 105 in the town of Newport, which lies on the Canadian border. VT 100 passes along the eastern edge of the Green Mountain National Forest for much of its length and also passes through the Mad River Valley. It runs parallel to, and lies between, U.S. Route 7 (US 7) to the west and US 5 to the east. Approaching VT 100B on VT 100 in Moretown The road is the main thoroughfare for some of Vermont's most well-known resort towns, including Wilmington, Ludlow, Killington, Warren, and Stowe. As such, many of Vermont's ski resorts are located either directly on, or in proximity to, VT 100; these include Okemo Mountain Resort, Mount Snow, Killington, Sugarbush, Mad River Glen, Stowe Mountain Resort and Jay Peak. VT 100 is a popular tourist route during the fall (for foliage) and winter (for skiing), and can be heavily trafficked during those seasons. Despite this, the road retains a rural feel through most of the towns it traverses and is relatively free of development, except for some of the areas around the ski resorts. The most populous town through which VT 100 passes is Morristown, with a population of just over 5,200. Several of the most heavily traveled sections of VT 100 (such as the section between Waterbury and Stowe and Warren to Waitsfield) were in very poor condition due to state and local road maintenance budget shortfalls, recent harsh winters and heavy damage by Tropical Storm Irene; since that storm, the state has undertaken the reconstruction of many segments of the road.

He earned a bachelor's degree from Kent State University and a master's degree from the University of Vermont. In 1969, he was hired as a sportscaster by WVNY in Burlington, Vermont despite no previous experience or education in broadcasting. After his wife became pregnant, Lobel took a higher paying job at WJOY. In 1972, he joined WGIR in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he hosted a nightly call-in show and called high school sports, Saint Anselm and Dartmouth hockey, and American Legion baseball. Lobel's show gained a following on Massachusetts' North Shore, where he became an alternative to WBZ's Guy Mainella. In October 1976, Lobel joined WBZ, where he succeeded Ken Beatrice as host of the 10 pm to midnight program, Calling All Sports. In February 1977 he was given the additional assignments of drive- time sports reporter and color commentator for Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins home games. In March 1977, Calling All Sports was moved to weekends with Upton Bell as a co-host. During the 1977 NBA Playoffs, Lobel filled in for Boston Celtics play by play announcer Johnny Most. WBZ-TV Lobel joined WBZ-TV as weekend sports anchor in 1979 and was promoted to weekday anchor and sports director in 1981. Lobel has also done some play-by-play work, calling WBZ's annual broadcast of the Boston Marathon, Boston Celtics games from 1989‚Äì1993, Boston College Eagles football games in 1986, New England Patriots preseason games from 1985‚Äì1991, and two NFL games for NBC in 1985. He was a sideline reporter for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament between 1995 and 1997. On the air, Lobel was known for using props and catchphrases during his sportscasts: * \\"Why can't we get players like that?\\" ‚Äì when any former player for a Boston team is shown making a big play for his new team. This is emphasized in instances when the former Boston player burns a Boston team. * the \\"Panic Button\\" when a local team is on a losing streak * a support beam from the Boston Garden occasionally used for Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics highlights.

Kidd had recently faced charges of domestic violence. Lobel immediately interrupted Ryan and tried to get Ryan to retract his comment, but Ryan refused. The Globe suspended Ryan for three weeks. In an Internet chat that summer, Lobel said that his actions were not \\"an act of heroism on my part, just knowing what is acceptable and what is not acceptable\\".

It is loosely based on the graphic novel From Hell by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell about the Jack the Ripper murders. The film stars Johnny Depp as Frederick Abberline, the lead investigator of the murders, and Heather Graham as Mary Kelly, a prostitute targeted by the Ripper. Other cast members include Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, and Jason Flemyng in supporting roles. From Hell was theatrically released in the United States on October 19, 2001, by 20th Century Fox. The film grossed over $74 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly Depp and Graham), atmosphere and production values, but was negatively compared to its source material. Plot In 1888, Mary Kelly and a small group of London prostitutes trudge through unrelenting daily misery. When their friend Ann Crook is kidnapped, they are drawn into a conspiracy with links to high society. The kidnapping is followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, Martha Tabram; and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down one by one as prostitutes are murdered and mutilated post-mortem. The murder of Martha and her companions grabs the attention of Whitechapel Police Inspector Frederick Abberline, a brilliant, yet troubled, man whose police work is often aided by his psychic \\"visions.\\" His colleague, Sergeant Peter Godley, tries to grasp his friend's wild theories. Abberline's investigations reveal that the murders, while gruesome, imply that an educated person is responsible due to the precise and almost surgical method used. Ann is found a few days later in a workhouse having been lobotomized after officials and doctors supposedly found her to be insane, though it is implied this was done to silence her. Abberline consults Sir William Gull, a physician to the Royal Family, drawing on his experience and knowledge of medicine. During this meeting, it is revealed Abberline is struggling with opium addiction. Gull's findings, coupled with his superiors impeding his investigations, point Abberline to a darker and more organized conspiracy than he originally thought. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love. Abberline deduces that Freemason influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter Albert Sickert's forbidden Catholic marriage to Crook, who bore his legitimate daughter, Alice. Sickert is actually Prince Albert, grandson of reigning Queen Victoria, and therefore Alice is heiress to the British throne. Gull boasts to Abberline that he will go down in history for giving \\"birth to the 20th century.\\" Abberline draws his gun, vowing that Gull will never see the 20th century, but before he is able to shoot Gull, he is knocked out by Ben Kidney, another Freemason. The Freemasons try to have Abberline eliminated without leaving any witnesses, but Abberline fights back and kills two of the assassins by overturning a carriage. Abberline tries to save Mary, but arrives too late, and blames his superior for not helping him or Godley on the cases. Abberline does nothing but watch Mary's mutilated body being taken away. Gull's increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated, mind. Rather than publicly charge Gull, the Freemasons decide to lobotomize him to protect themselves and the Royal Family from the scandal. Gull defiantly states he has no equal among men, remaining unrepentant up to his lobotomy, resulting in him becoming invalid just as Ann had been. Abberline goes to the Ten Bells Tavern in Whitechapel and receives a mysterious letter, which he soon realizes is from Mary. As it turns out, Gull mistook a sleeping Ada for Mary and killed her instead. Abberline decides not to look for her as a way to offer her protection, as the Freemasons are watching his every move. Abberline then burns the letter, knowing that he can never have a normal life with her. Years later, Mary is seen living with Alice as her daughter, in a cottage on a cliff by the sea. Abberline is found dead in an opium den of an overdose by Sergeant Godley. Godley places coins with Queen Victoria's image on them over Abberline's eyes, pats him on the arm, and tells him to \\"Good night, sweet prince.\\" Cast * Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline, a sympathetic police officer who investigates the Ripper murders.

Plot Ryan (Shane West) is a bit of a geek with eyes for the school sex bomb, Ashley (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), which induces cringing in his neighbor and best friend, Maggie (Marla Sokoloff), a cute, intellectual girl. But popular jock Chris (James Franco) has his eye on Maggie, and he offers to help Ryan win Ashley if Ryan will help Chris with Maggie. So begins a two-headed variation on Cyrano de Bergerac; Ryan composes soulful e-mails for Chris, and Chris advises Ryan to treat Ashley like dirt, which seems to be the only way to get her attention. At first, neither finds it easy to change their ways; Chris comes on too strong, and Ryan is too nervous to be a jerk. But as they start to succeed, Ryan begins to see Maggie in a new light and wonders if he's pursuing the right girl.

The Court held that the lack of a positive framework that protected farm workers from employer reprisals for exercising their associational rights under the Charter constituted a \\"substantial interference\\" of their right to freedom of association. The Ontario government responded with the Agricultural Employees Protection Act, which extended only to agricultural workers and prohibited employer reprisals against employees exercising their rights under section 2(d) of the Charter. Background In 1994, the Ontario government under the New Democratic Party of Ontario passed the Agricultural Labour Relations Act which gave trade union and collective bargaining rights to Ontario's agricultural workers. The following year, the Conservatives were elected into power and subsequently passed the Labour Relations and Employment Statute Law Amendment Act (LRESLAA), which repealed the 1994 Act and terminated any collective agreements made under that Act. Tom Dunmore, Salame Abdulhamid, Walter Lumsden and Michael Doyle with support from the United Food and Commercial Workers brought an application on behalf of the agricultural workers of Ontario to challenge the LRESLAA as a violation of their right to freedom of association and equality rights under sections 2(d) and 15(1) of the Charter respectively. At trial, the judge found that the LRESLAA did not prevent the agricultural workers from forming a labour union and that any obstacles were the result of the actions of their employers which are private parties and beyond the scope of the Charter. The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The issues before the Supreme Court was whether the LRESLAA violated section 2(d) or 15(1) of the Charter, and if so, whether it could be saved under section 1. The majority of the Court held that section 2(d) was violated and could not be justified under section 1. Opinion of the Court Bastarache J wrote the opinion for the majority. He began by describing the purpose of section 2(d) which is \\"to allow the achievement of individual potential through interpersonal relationships and collective action\\".para. 17 The previous interpretation of section 2(d) which only protected individuals, said Bastarache, was insufficient. The right should be broader and should create a \\"positive obligation on the state to extend protective legislation to unprotected groups\\".para. 20 For a claimant to successfully argue that the under-inclusiveness of legislation violated his or her right to freedom of association, he or she must \\"demonstrate that exclusion from a statutory regime permits a substantial interference\\"para. 25 of their right. Bastarache examined the LRESLAA and found that its purpose was \\"to establish and maintain an association of employees\\", which would fall under section 2(d). Though the purpose of the Act did not violate the Charter, the effect of the Act did violate the Charter. By removing the ALRA and excluding the agricultural workers, their vulnerable position was reinforced and they became substantially incapable of exercising their rights. Dissent In dissent, Major J argued that section 2(d) did not impose any positive rights and that there was nothing preventing the workers from forming their own association.

In 1954, while employed as a chemical engineer for North American Aviation, Kanarek had his security clearance revoked by the Air Force on suspicion of communist associations.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/irving-kanarek-dead.html He successfully sued for reinstatement of the clearance and back pay. He then attended the University of Washington as an undergraduate and Loyola Law School. He was admitted to the California Bar in 1957. He married, fathered two daughters, and later divorced. Legal tactics According to Tate- LaBianca prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, Kanarek was legendary in Los Angeles courts for his dilatory, obstructionist tactics. In his book, Helter Skelter, Bugliosi claimed Kanarek, in a different case, had once objected to a witness identifying himself: Kanarek claimed that the witness‚Äôs name was hearsay because the witness had first heard it from his mother.Bugliosi page 549 In the Tate-LaBianca trial, Kanarek objected nine times during opening statements, despite continuous censure by Judge Charles Older. During a later objection, he called witness Linda Kasabian insane, and by the third day of the trial, he had objected more than 200 times. Bugliosi, also wrote of Kanarek as opposing counsel during the Manson case saying, ‚ÄúThe press focused on his bombast and missed his effectiveness. He fought as if he were personally on trial.\\" During the course of the trial he was jailed twice by Judge Older for contempt of court. In his summation, Bugliosi dubbed Kanarek \\"the Toscanini of Tedium.\\" Kanarek believed fiercely in the constitutional right to counsel, and that everyone was entitled to their day in court. He said, ‚ÄúI would defend a client who I knew was guilty of horrific crimes. They have to be proved guilty. I‚Äôve had cases where people were guilty as hell but they couldn‚Äôt prove it. And if they can‚Äôt prove it, he‚Äôs not guilty. In that case, the person walks free. That‚Äôs American justice.‚Äùhttps://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/27/lawyers-defended- toughest-cases-charles-manson-jon-venables-ted-bundy-charles-ng Later life and death Throughout his later life, Kanarek lived in Orange County, California. A mental breakdown in 1989 led the Bar to suspend his law license, leaving him in financial difficulties. He died at 100 on September 2, 2020.  Legacy  In November 2008, a stage play premiered at Caltech in Pasadena, California, entitled Rocket Girl, about the life of Mary Sherman Morgan, a former co-worker of Kanarek at North American Aviation. The play was written by her son, George D. Morgan. The character of Kanarek appears throughout most of the play. The play was later turned into a book of the same name.Rocket Girl, georgedmorgan.com; accessed March 18, 2017.

Its contributors criticize Chomsky's political and linguistic writings, claiming that he cherry-picks facts to fit his theories. Contents The Anti-Chomsky Reader contains the following articles: * An introduction by Peter Collier * \\"Whitewashing Dictatorship in Vietnam and Cambodia\\" by Steven J. Morris, Senior Fellow at The Foreign Policy Institute, Johns Hopkins University, accuses Chomsky of denying repression and mass murder under the communist regimes of Vietnam and Cambodia. Morris claims that Chomsky adheres to a Marxist-derived view of the Indochina wars which refuses to acknowledge the totalitarian nature of the regimes in question. (pages 1‚Äì34) * \\"Chomsky and the Cold War\\" by Thomas M. Nichols, chairman of the Department of Strategy and Policy, U.S. Naval War College, claims that Chomsky has distorted the history of the Cold War in order to minimize the role of Communist ideology and blame the conflict on the United States. He accuses Chomsky of misusing sources and footnoting his books in manipulative and dishonest ways \\"to create a kind of pseudo-academic smog\\" often leading back to Chomsky's own work. He discusses a 1990 letter from Chomsky to Alexander Cockburn which Nichols claims laments the defeat of the Soviet Union and other Communist states and movements at the end of the Cold War, particularly singling out Czech dissident V√°clav Havel for vituperation. (pages 35‚Äì65) * \\"Chomsky and the Media: A Kept Press and a Manipulated People\\" by Eli Lehrer, former editor of American Enterprise, is a critique of Chomsky's \\"propaganda model\\" of the American media as stated in Chomsky's book, Manufacturing Consent. Lehrer accuses Chomsky of being \\"an outsider who knows relatively little about the media... except to the degree that 'media subservience' serves to explain why there is no outcry against the evil he sees everywhere in the American enterprise.\\" (pages 67‚Äì84) * \\"Chomsky's War Against Israel\\" by Paul Bogdanor criticizes Chomsky's stance on Israel. Bogdanor charges that Chomsky distorts historical fact and falsely accuses Israel of atrocities and rejectionism while downplaying Arab aggression and violence against the Jewish State. (pages 87‚Äì116) * \\"Chomsky and Holocaust Denial\\", by Werner Cohn of Brooklyn, New York and professor emeritus of sociology at the University of British Columbia, analyzes Chomsky's role in the Faurisson affair through his connections to Faurisson's publisher La Vieille Taupe. Cohn accuses Chomsky of close connections to French anti-semites and Holocaust Deniers through this organization (pages 117‚Äì58). Chomsky replied in Outlook.Reply to Werner Cohn by Noam Chomsky. Outlook, June 1, 1989 * \\"Chomsky and 9/11\\" by David Horowitz and Ronald Radosh analyzes a speech given by Chomsky at MIT immediately after 9/11. Horowitz and Radosh allege that \\"Chomsky detected [a] plot by Washington to deliberately starve 3 to 4 million innocent Afghan civilians\\". They also claim that Chomsky justifies the 9/11 attacks in his speech and distorts American history to make the United States appear to be a terrorist nation. (pages 161‚Äì80) * \\"Noam Chomsky's Anti-American Obsession\\", by David Horowitz, accuses Chomsky of being an anti-American ideologue who sees the United States as evil and rewrites American history accordingly. Horowitz claims that Chomsky is the intellectual source of left-wing anti-Americanism today. (pages 181‚Äì200) * \\"A Corrupted Linguistics\\" by Robert D. Levine and Paul M. Postal, both professors of linguistics, claims that Chomsky's linguistic work has been largely superseded or abandoned. They also accuse Chomsky of intellectual misconduct in his linguistic writings. (pages 203‚Äì31) * \\"Chomsky, Language, World War II and Me\\" by John Williamson criticizes Chomsky's linguistic work and recounts a long email debate between Chomsky and the author in which Williamson claims Chomsky repeatedly lied about his own statements and about historical facts and sources. (pages 233‚Äì48)  Reception  The conservative historian Keith Windschuttle, in a review in the conservative magazine New Criterion, states that \\"Collier, Horowitz, and their six other authors have produced a book that has long been needed. It provides a penetrating coverage of the disgraceful career of a disgraceful but very influential man, who has so far avoided a criticism as thoroughgoing as this.\\" The English professor Mark Bauerlein, in a generally positive review in the libertarian magazine Reason, claims that \\"Collier and Horowitz understand well the manufactured reality of political fame, and to dismantle it requires not contrary vitriol or clever rejoinders but direct, fact-based assertions that undermine the authenticity of the image. To that end, the contributors follow a simple procedure: Quote actual statements by Chomsky and test them for evidence and logic. The best contributions to the volume add the effective and timely tactic of citing Chomsky's progressive virtues and revealing how smoothly he abandons them.\\" Michael Leon, in a review in CoreWeekly, wrote a scathing critique claiming that \\"The Anti-Chomsky Reader is mired in a thick haze of loathing and hard- right ideology, short on verifiable facts and long on ideologically-steeped assertions\\" and that the book is full of baseless claims that are intended for character assassination. The author Anthony F. Greco criticized Collier and Horowitz for being biased and selective and not acknowledging any merit in Chomsky's writings.Greco, Anthony F. Chomskys Challenge to American Power a Guide for the Critical Reader. Vanderbilt University Press, 2013. John Feffer accused Collier and Horowitz of blatant dishonesty and has stated that they wrote the book to attack Chomsky because their careers were failing after their popularity died out during the Clinton administration years. Feffer also added that they had to make a dishonest living creating fictitious allegations of liberal bias in academia.Feffer, John. ‚ÄúSecond Thoughts.‚Äù Institute for Policy Studies, 9 May 2014.

This battle was part of the establishing of a new form of government, the so-called Directory, and it was a major factor in the rapid advancement of Republican General Napoleon Bonaparte's career. Background The social reforms of the French Revolution had been well received by the majority of the populace of France, but the Revolution's strongly anti-Catholic stance had created anti- republican sympathies in many Roman Catholics. In March 1793, this sentiment boiled over into an armed insurrection in the fiercely Catholic Vend√©e region of western France. A rebel army titled Arm√©e catholique et royale now proved to be a thorn in the side of the Revolutionary Government in Paris, under leaders such as Fran√ßois de Charette de la Contrie and Maurice d'Elb√©e. The rebels were known as Chouans, a title which comes from early royalist leader Jean Cottereau's nickname Jean Chouan. He was known for his perfect imitation of an owl's cry, a noise which had become the rallying cry of the insurgents of Vend√©e. The Arm√©e catholique et royale quickly garnered British support and got off to a promising start, severely defeating several Revolutionary Armies. The Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety ordered General Jean-Baptiste Carrier to pacify the region, and over several months Carrier ruthlessly decimated the populace of the Vend√©e. The local population dubbed Carrier's forces the colonnes infernales (hellish columns). On 22 December 1793, the Chouan rebellion subsided following a major defeat at the Battle of Savenay. Following the 9th Thermidor, those Chouans willing to lay down arms were granted amnesty by the reformed National Convention. The Chouans responded by attacking the Republican-held town of Gu√©men√© on 28 January 1795. The Convention immediately ordered General Hoche to proceed to the Vend√©e and force the Chouans to agree to a cessation of hostilities. Hoche quickly defeated the Chouan army and on 17 February Fran√ßois de Charette de la Contrie signed a very generous peace settlement. A small contingent of Royalists under the command of General Stofflet and the fanatical Abb√© Bernier refused to accept the peace settlement and continued to offer resistance to Hoche's Army. They were supported by the British in the form of 4,000 √©migr√©s, 80,000 muskets, and 80 cannon, along with food, clothing, and even a large quantity of counterfeit assignats (to provide the Chouans with funding, but also to unbalance the French economy). This large force was placed under the command of √©migr√© G√©n√©rals Puisaye and Hermilly. Hearing of this, de Charette de la Contrie broke the peace agreement and reopened hostilities. On 26 June, the √©migr√© force landed at Carnac. Hermilly quickly advanced on Auray before engaging and being defeated by Hoche at Vannes. By early July, Hemilly had been forced out of Auray and was besieged in the Fortress of Penthi√®vre. This meant that the entire insurgent army was now trapped on the Quiberon peninsula. On 15 July, an additional √©migr√© division arrived to bolster the defense, under the command of G√©n√©ral Sombreuil, but Hermilly was killed in action on 16 July. By the 20th, the fortress had fallen and Hoche swiftly advanced down the peninsula, defeating the hopelessly trapped √©migr√© army. Only G√©n√©ral Puisaye and a small force were able to escape with the British fleet; the remainder were killed in action, taken prisoner, or executed. Despite the failure of the √©migr√© army, de Charette de la Contrie continued to offer resistance. In early September, a popular revolt broke out in the area around Dreux, but it was defeated in battle at Nonancourt. De Charette de la Contrie himself suffered a major defeat at Saint-Cyr on 25 September. Despite this, the Comte d'Artois landed at √éle d'Yeu with 1,000 √©migr√©s and 2,000 British troops. Bolstered by this force, the Royalist troops began marching on Paris in early October 1795. The arrival of the Comte d'Artois excited the jeunesse dor√©e royalist supporters in the Le Peletier section of the capital (named for the Rue Le Peletier in what is now the Second Arrondissement), and they began demonstrations in the form of felling Liberty Trees and trampling cockades of France. Rumours began to circulate regarding the likely defection of the entire Paris National Guard. Vend√©miaire Pro-Convention gunners firing on the Royalist mob The Convention quickly realised that it was in severe danger, and that an enemy force was on French soil; indeed, the uprising in Paris meant that there was now an enemy force within the capital itself. The Convention declared its intention to remain in their meeting rooms until the crisis was resolved. It called for the formation of three battalions of patriots to be raised from the Jacobin military staff dismissed after 9 Thermidore. G√©n√©ral Menou was given command of the defence of the capital, but he was severely outnumbered with only 5,000 troops on hand to resist the 30,000-man Royalist Army. On 12 vend√©miaire (4 October 1795), the National Guard arrived in Le Peletier in an attempt to put down the unrest. The Military Committee of the Sections of the Capital under the command of Richer de S√©vigny announced that the decrees of the Convention were no longer recognised. G√©n√©ral Danican took command of the National Guard in the Le Peletier section. The Convention ordered Menou to advance into Le Peletier, to disarm the entire area, and to close Danican's headquarters. Generals Despierres and Verdi√®re were sent to Menou to assist him. Menou divided his force into three columns and planned an advance into Le Peletier on the evening of 12 vend√©miaire. When the advance was set to begin, Despierres reported that he was unwell and unable to proceed, and Verdi√®re refused to advance. Menou timidly advanced towards the Royalist force, inviting the rebels to discuss terms of their dispersal. He withdrew after receiving the insurgents' promise to disarm. The Le Peletier section, seeing this as a sign of weakness on the part of the Convention, called upon the other sections of Paris to rise up. Menou realised his mistake, and launched a cavalry attack down the Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre, temporarily clearing the area of royalists. The Convention dismissed Menou from the command and ordered Paul Barras to take over the defence of the Convention. A whiff of grapeshot Bonaparte orders to shoot at the section members), Histoire de la R√©volution, Adolphe Thiers, ed. 1866, design by Yan' Dargent Young General Napol√©on Bonaparte was aware of the commotion, and he arrived at the Convention around this time to find out what was happening. He was quickly ordered to join Barras' forces mustering for the defence of the Republic. Bonaparte accepted, but only on the condition that he was granted complete freedom of movement. At 1 am on 13 Vend√©miaire (5 October), Bonaparte overrode Barras, who was content to let him do as he wished. Bonaparte ordered Joachim Murat, a sous-lieutenant in the 12√®me R√©giment de Chasseurs √† Cheval, to ride to the plain of Sablons and to return with the 40 cannons which Menou had indicated were located there. Murat's squadron retrieved the cannons before the Royalists arrived and Bonaparte organised their arrangement, placing them in commanding areas with effective fields of fire. At 5 am, a probing attack by the royalist forces was repulsed. Five hours later, the major Royalist assault began. The Republican forces were outnumbered by approximately 6 to 1, but they held their perimeter all the same, the cannons firing grapeshot into the massed royalist forces. The \\"patriot battalions\\" supporting the artillery also cut down the advancing Royalist ranks. Bonaparte commanded throughout the two-hour engagement, and survived unscathed despite having his horse shot from under him. The effect of the grapeshot and the volleys from the patriot forces caused the Royalist attack to waver. Bonaparte ordered a counterattack led by Murat's squadron of Chasseurs. At the close of the battle, around three hundred royalists lay dead on the streets of Paris. Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle later famously recorded that, on this occasion, Bonaparte gave his opponent a \\"Whiff of Grapeshot\\"Carlyle, The French Revolution, vol.III, book 3.VII and that \\"the thing we specifically call French Revolution is blown into space by it.\\" That is, 13 Vend√©miaire marks the ending of the French Revolution. (The phrase is often ascribed to Bonaparte himself, but the words are probably Carlyle's.Napoleon's Whiff of Grapeshot. By Jonathan Gifford (undated). Accessed 2015-01-20. Archived 2015-04-09.) Aftermath The defeat of the Royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the Convention. Bonaparte became a national hero, and was quickly promoted to G√©n√©ral de Division.

Mabelvale was a small, unincorporated train station town in southwestern Pulaski County, Arkansas, until being annexed into Little Rock following a special election that was held on May 3, 1973. The area today is part of Little Rock's seventh ward, although it retains a separate postal designation and ZIP code [72103] from most of the rest of the city. The neighborhood is currently represented on Little Rock's City Board of Directors by Brenda \\"B.J.\\" Wyrick. The neighborhood is generally defined as the homes and businesses in the immediate area surrounding the intersection of Mabelvale Main Street and the Union Pacific railroad line. However, its location on the southwestern fringe of Little Rock proper ‚Äî as well as its proximity to unincorporated communities, to other neighborhoods in Southwest Little Rock, and to adjoining towns such as Shannon Hills which share the ZIP code ‚Äî often leads to varying definitions of Mabelvale's boundaries. Even so, most would agree that the area generally referred to contemporarily as Mabelvale spans multiple counties: while primarily located in Pulaski County, some of its areas spill over into neighboring Saline County. Neighborhood Services Most major community services are linked with the various governmental departments of the City of Little Rock. The city's street department maintains all streets in Little Rock's incorporated parts of Mabelvale, notably Mabelvale Main Street, Mabelvale Cut-Off Road, and Mabelvale West Road ‚Äî three of the neighborhood's busier paths. Little Rock Fire Station #18, which provides fire protection for the area, is located on Mabelvale West Road. Police service is covered by the Little Rock Police Department's Southwest Substation on Baseline Road. Public transportation is provided by bus service on the Central Arkansas Transit Authority's Route #17. Three Little Rock School District campuses are located around the neighborhood, providing education from pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade. Mabelvale Elementary School is located on Mabelvale Cut-Off Road across the street from Morehart Park and has served the area since opening in 1980. Across the neighborhood is Mabelvale Magnet Middle School on Mabelvale West Road near the post office. The middle school first opened in 1952, and joined the Little Rock district in 1987 to serve a large portion of southern neighborhoods throughout the city. Also in the area is Chicot Elementary, which serves students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Morehart Park, a forty-three-acre municipal park, is owned and operated by the City of Little Rock's Parks and Recreation Department. Initial preparation for the park was conducted by the Arkansas Archeological Survey in 1978. Today, Morehart Park includes a pavilion, a disc golf course, separate tennis and basketball courts, a softball and baseball field, playground areas for children, and hiking and jogging paths. The Morehart Spring is nestled away in a heavily wooded eastern portion of the park; it is the source of a small northward- flowing brooklet that throughout the year provides vitally needed pure, crystalline water for the park's wildlife and birdlife. The park takes its name from the family of Amos Morehart and his wife Emma Harrison Morehart. Amos Morehart and his new bride Emma first settled on what is now a portion of the park land in 1890: in that year the land had been given as a wedding present to Amos Morehart by his father, Henry Morehart.Ina Mae Word, \\"Pioneer of Mabelvale: Biography of Mr. and Mrs. Amos Morehart,\\" Mabelvale Legionnaire, Volume I, Number 7, June 28,1940, p. 3. Thereafter, Amos Morehart regularly purchased additional surrounding acreage over the years (most of which subsequently would also become part of the park). He operated on his property a berry, fruit, and vegetable farm; an apiary; a sawmill camp; and a tanyard, having purchased the license for the latter business from previous owners, who had already incorporated it under the name of the \\"Swamp Angel Tannery.\\" A community leader who was active in civic affairs, for many years Amos Morehart served as a president and a member of the Board of Directors of the former Mabelvale Rural School District. Amos Morehart's father, Henry Morehart, had likewise been active in local Mabelvale community life: he was a leader of the agrarian insurgency and farmers' third-party political rebellion of the late 1880s and ran for the state legislature in 1888 as a third-party candidate. Despite a theft of ballot boxes by his opponents, he and his running mates were eventually declared victorious and assumed their seats as Pulaski County state representatives in the Arkansas General Assembly on February 18, 1889. In addition to their public service as office-holders, both men are remembered for their community involvements and philanthropic contributions to the Mabelvale community. During the era of the Second World War, Amos Morehart deeded a parcel of his land to the local chapter of the American Legion, to be used as the location for a new Legion meeting post. Earlier, his father, Henry Morehart, donated several acres of his farm on Sardis Road (which he had homesteaded beginning in 1881), so that they could be used as the location for Mabelvale's pioneer Good Hope School. A number of descendants of Amos and Henry Morehart still reside in the Mabelvale area. While Morehart Park is by far the largest park within Mabelvale, a non-contiguous much smaller park lies just to its north. Known as Little Oaks Park, this smaller recreational area was begun as a ballpark for Little League games. Located near the intersection of Leah Lane and Sardis Road in downtown Mabelvale, its name may have derived from the old adage, \\"From a small acorn a mighty oak will grow.\\" Community organizations The Vedanta Society of Arkansas has a temple in Mabelvale. Other community groups include Adoniram Lodge Number 288 of Free and Accepted Masons and its affiliated Masonic organizations, Adoniram Chapter Number 604 of the Order of Eastern Star for women and Adoniram Assembly Number 99 of the International Order of the Rainbow for girls. All three of these latter groups meet regularly at the Masonic Temple, which is located at 9725 Mabelvale Main Street, on the southeast corner of Mabelvale Main and Sardis Road.

McNab won the Stanley Cup with the Detroit Red Wings in 1950, centering a line with Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay. He later played in the Western Hockey League, earning league MVP honors in 1955 with the New Westminster Royals. McNab's coaching and management career included stints as the general manager of the Washington Capitals and New Jersey Devils. He also spent time as president of the Central Hockey League; the Max McNab Trophy, awarded to the MVP of the league playoffs, would later be named in his honour. In 1998, McNab was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy in recognition of his contributions to hockey in the United States. Playing career After playing junior hockey in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, McNab played on the Omaha Knights of the USHL in the 1946‚Äì48 season before being called up to the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League in 1947. He would play on and off with the Red Wings until 1951, playing on the team that won the Stanley Cup in 1950. He played for the Indianapolis Capitols of the American Hockey League in 1950‚Äì51. Before the 1951‚Äì52 season, he was traded by the Red Wings to the Chicago Black Hawks, but never played for the team. Back surgery kept him out of action in 1951‚Äì52 and McNab then joined the New Westminster Royals of the Western Hockey League, where he played for seven seasons, retiring in 1959. He was voted league MVP in 1955, scoring 32 goals and 81 points. Coaching and managing In 1961, McNab became general manager and coach of the San Francisco Seals of the WHL. He was then coach of the WHL's Vancouver Canucks and in 1966 was hired as coach and general manager of the San Diego Gulls. He rose in the front office to vice-president by 1971. In 1974 he was named president of the Central Hockey League. Although he would only remain with the CHL for a year, the Max McNab Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player in the league's playoffs, would be named in his honor. Near the end of 1975, he joined the NHL as general manager of the Washington Capitals, succeeding Milt Schmidt. McNab remained in that job until 1982. Under his watch, the team drafted players such as Rick Green, Ryan Walter, Mike Gartner, and Bobby Carpenter. Midway through the 1983‚Äì84 season, McNab joined the New Jersey Devils as vice- president and general manager. He would remain their general manager until 1987, and then retired from the team and hockey in the 1990s. During his tenure as Devils' GM, players such as Chris Terreri, Kirk Muller, Sean Burke, and Eric Weinrich would be drafted. In 1998, McNab was recognized for his contribution to ice hockey in the United States by the NHL and USA Hockey as co-recipient of the Lester Patrick Trophy. Family Two of McNab's three sons have hockey-related careers: Peter McNab played in the NHL for 15 seasons, scoring 363 goals and 813 points, and is currently a television color analyst for the Colorado Avalanche; and David McNab is currently Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations with the Anaheim Ducks.

He also played on hit records by Bob James, Duran Duran, Carly Simon, Barbra Streisand, Yoko Ono, Meatloaf, Alice Cooper, BJ Thomas, and many others. Barely out of junior high school, his first group was a doo- wop street corner quintet called the Velons. By the early 1960s, he had become an excellent percussionist, playing almost exclusively with Latin bands around New York. Maelen became lead singer, percussionist and founding member of Ambergris, and played with them for a few years. For the next two or three years, he worked with several bands and did session work. By the mid 1970s, his career took off. For most of the late 1970s into the 1980s he was one of the \\"first call\\" percussion players in New York City. During the golden years of the disco era he was especially successful, working with the remix team of Michael Barbiero and John Luongo and overdubbing on extended dance versions of disco classics such as Gonzales' \\"I Haven't Stopped Dancin' Yet\\", The Jacksons' \\"Blame It on the Boogie\\" and \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\\", Dan Hartman's \\"Vertigo/Relight My Fire\\", Jackie Moore's \\"This Time Baby\\" and many more. He can be heard playing seven tracks of percussion on Barry Manilow's classic hit \\"Copacabana\\". As a percussionist, he also appeared on the album, Desire Wire (Cindy Bullens album), made from 1978, done by Cindy Bullens. His working relationship with Barbiero and Luongo led to a solo album for Epic/Columbia in 1980, produced by the trio and entitled Beats Workin. Both the Doobie Brothers' \\"What a Fool Believes\\" and The Jacksons' \\"Shake Your Body\\" credit him not just on the back covers but on the record labels themselves. Maelen's first album with Roxy Music was the critically acclaimed Avalon. He also played on the Dire Straits Brothers in Arms album, and appeared with both Roxy Music and Dire Straits at Live Aid in London. He also toured with Peter Gabriel on his first solo tour in 1977. Maelen worked as a studio musician on Alphaville's 1986 album, Afternoons in Utopia. At the time of his death he was producing his first rock band Cherri Red, along with Gary Chester at the Edison Recording Studio in New York City. Subsequently, one of the songs \\"Be With You Tonight\\" which was written by John Bussi, was used in the film See You in the Morning directed by Alan J. Pakula. Maelen died of leukemia on January 14, 1988. He was 47 years old.

He founded the Indian National Association, through which he led two sessions of the Indian National Conference in 1883 and 1885, along with Anandamohan Bose. Banerjee later became a senior leader of the Indian National Congress. Surendranath welcomed Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms, unlike Congress, and with many liberal leaders he left Congress and founded a new organisation named Indian National Liberation Federation in 1919. He was one of the founding members of the Indian National Congress. Banerjee on a 1983 stamp of India Early life Surendranath Banerjee was born in Calcutta (Kolkata), in the province of Bengal to a Bengali Brahmins family. He was deeply influenced in liberal, progressive thinking by his father Durga Charan Banerjee, a doctor. After graduating from the University of Calcutta, he travelled to England in 1868, along with Romesh Chunder Dutt and Behari Lal Gupta, to compete in the Indian Civil Service examinations.https://www.forwardpress.in/2019/05/s-n-banerjea- epitomized-the-brahmanical-numbness-to-injustice/ He cleared the competitive examination in 1869, but was barred owing to a claim he had misrepresented his age. After clearing the matter in the courts by arguing that he calculated his age according to the Hindu custom of reckoning age from the date of conception rather than from birth, Banerjee cleared the exam again in 1871 and was posted as assistant magistrate in Sylhet. Banerjee also attended classes at University College, London. He took his final exams in 1871 and returned to India in August 1871. In 1874, Banerjee returned to London and became a student at the Middle Temple. Banerjee was soon dismissed for making a minor judicial error. He went to England to appeal his discharge, but was unsuccessful because, he felt, of racial discrimination. He would return to India bitter and disillusioned with the British. During his stay in England (1874‚Äì1875), he studied the works of Edmund Burke and other liberal philosophers. These works guided him in his protests against the British. He was known as the Indian Burke.For his tenacity he was called 'Surrender Not Banerjee' by the British. Surendranath was influenced by the writings of Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini. He studied the writings of Mazzini in his stay in England (1874-1875) on Anandmohan's suggestion.Asoka Kr. Sen, The Educated Middle Class and Indian Nationalism, (Progressive Publishers, 37 A college street, Cal- 73, 1988), p. 102. Political career Upon his return to India in June 1875, Banerjee became an English professor at the Metropolitan Institution, the Free Church InstitutionStaff List: Free Church Institution and Duff College (1843‚Äì1907) in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 570 and at the Rippon College, now Surendranath College, founded by him in 1882. He began delivering public speeches on nationalist and liberal political subjects, as well as Indian history. He founded the Indian National Association with Anandamohan Bose, one of the earliest Indian political organizations of its kind, on 26 July 1876. In 1878 in a meeting to preach the Indian people he said \\"The great doctrine of peace & goodwill between Hindus & Musulmans, Christians & Paresees, aye between all sections of our country's progress. Let the word \\"Unity\\" be inscribed therein characters of glittering gold........There may be religious difference between us. There may be social difference between us. But there is a common platform where we may all meet, the platform of our country's welfare\\". He used the organization to tackle the issue of the age-limit for Indian students appearing for ICS examinations. He condemned the racial discrimination perpetrated by British officials in India through speeches all over the country, which made him very popular. In 1879, he founded the newspaper, The Bengalee In 1883, when Banerjee was arrested for publishing remarks in his paper, in contempt of court, protests and hartals erupted across Bengal, and in Indian cities such as Agra, Faizabad, Amritsar, Lahore and Pune. He became the first Indian journalist to be imprisoned. The INC expanded considerably, and hundreds of delegates from across India came to attend its annual conference in Calcutta. After the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 in Bombay, Banerjee merged his organization with it owing to their common objectives and memberships in 1886. He was elected the Congress President in 1895 at Poona and in 1902 at Ahmedabad. Surendranath was one of the most important public leaders who protested the partition of the Bengal province in 1905. Banerjee was in the forefront of the movement and organized protests, petitions and extensive public support across Bengal and India, which finally compelled the British to reverse the bifurcation of Bengal in 1912. Banerjee became the patron of rising Indian leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Sarojini Naidu. Banerjee was also one of the senior-most leaders of the moderate Congress ‚Äî those who favoured accommodation and dialogue with the British ‚Äî after the \\"extremists\\" ‚Äì those who advocated revolution and political independence ‚Äî led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak left the party in 1906. Banerjee was an important figure in the Swadeshi movement ‚Äì advocating goods manufactured in India against foreign products ‚Äî and his popularity at its apex made him, in words of admirers, the uncrowned king of Bengal. Later career The declining popularity of moderate Indian politicians affected Banerjee's role in Indian politics. Banerjee supported the Morley-Minto reforms 1909 ‚Äì which were resented and ridiculed as insufficient and meaningless by the vast majority of the Indian public and nationalist politicians. Banerjee was a critic of the proposed method of civil disobedience advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, the rising popular leader of Indian nationalists and the Congress Party. Surendranath Banerjee, a moderate and veteran leader of Congress were in favour to accept the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. They left the Congress and founded Indian Liberation Federation. They were termed as Liberals and they lost their relevance in Indian National Movement thereafter.http://www.galaxyiasacademy.com/uploads/Modern-India-by- Bipan-Chandra-XIIOld-Edition-NCERT.pdf, pg 263 Accepting the portfolio of minister in the Bengal government earned him the ire of nationalists and much of the public, and he lost the election to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1923 to Bidhan Chandra Roy, the candidate of the Swarajya Party ‚Äì ending his political career for all practical purposes. He was knighted for his political support of the British Empire. Banerjee made the Calcutta Municipal Corporation a more democratic body while serving as a minister in the Bengal government. He is remembered and widely respected today as a pioneer leader of Indian politics ‚Äî first treading the path for Indian political empowerment. ' But nationalist politics in India meant opposition, and increasingly there were others whose opposition was more vigorous and who came to center stage. Banerjee could accept neither the extremist view of political action nor the noncooperation of Gandhi, then emerging as a major factor in the nationalist movement. Banerjee saw the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms of 1919 as substantially fulfilling Congress's demands, a position which further isolated him. He was elected to the reformed Legislative Council of Bengal in 1921, knighted in the same yearhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Surendranath-Banerjea and held office as minister for local self-government from 1921 to 1924. His defeat at the polls in 1923 brought his political career to a close and he went on to write the widely acclaimed A Nation in Making, published in 1925. After Surendranath died at Barrackpore on 6 August 1925.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 312. It is due west of the city of Lincoln and east of the market town of Retford. Geography The Parish of Laneham had a total population of 279 people at the 2001 census, somewhat reduced from the 410 people who lived in the village in 1851. The parish covers an area of , and includes the two settlements of \\"Town\\" Laneham and \\"Church\\" Laneham, separated by the village beck and a short stretch of low-lying ground. The eastern boundary is formed by the River Trent. Prior to 1884, the parish included of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of Kettlethorpe. Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922. The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry. In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768‚Äì9 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land. Infrastructure There are a number of listed buildings in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century, and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century. Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic, while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable- ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing. As a result of the influence of the enclosure movement, the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village. Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of George III's reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's . Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained. There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 messuages and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists. The village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009‚Äì10), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. The Ferryboat Inn continues to operate as a free house in Church Laneham under new ownership following a period of closure in 2019. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The Parish Church of St. Peter remains open, and is a grade I listed building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of Church Laneham; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636. A small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799. The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884. Laneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now. Charities Information about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men ‚Äòsurrendered‚Äô a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around ¬£11 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost ¬£5-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor. During the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left ¬£20 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been ‚Äòvested‚Äô in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to ‚Äòhonest widows.‚Äô The population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \\"poor\\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time. Historical events The archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. William was Prebendary of Bole by 1212 and Archdeacon of Durham by 1224 but in October 1243 'some men were imprisoned at York under suspicion of being concerned in his death.' Fast Ecclesiae Anglicanae, vol 6/26 King Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255 and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7. Thomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 ‚Äì to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and the Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2. There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s. In 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87. Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William‚Äôs conduct ‚Äòinflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace‚Äô. Damages to Richard‚Äôs property amounted to 40 marks. Little is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \\"6d for riot\\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth. An old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years. At the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. He was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood ‚Äì to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages. Ellis Markham had two sons ‚Äì Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge ‚Äì Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel. This was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham ‚Äì the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' ‚Äì and father of Thomas Helwys the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily. Jerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life ‚Äì with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.‚Äô In 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park ‚Äì territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.‚Äô This incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge ‚Äì but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth ¬£5000 ‚Äì at least ¬£800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church. He cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending ¬£40 a year though his income from land was ¬£800 and he had ¬£40,000 in money ‚Äì so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested. The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years ‚Äì so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow! He died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already ‚Äì having been presumably commissioned by his father. In the Stuart era William Tirwhitt (or Tyrwhitt) was a landowner in the village. He died in 1642 and by 1648 his Laneham lands were sequestered due to his being 'a delinquent Papist' and a 'Papist in arms' but they were restored after the Restoration.Calendar: Committee for Compounding, Part 3 September 1648, published 1891 There also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence. In 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of ¬£800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.' According to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription: :My tongs and hammer I‚Äôve declined :My bellows they have lost their wind :My fires extinct my forge decayed :And in the dust my vice is laid :My coals are spent my iron gone :My nails are drove my work is done. Only a few parts of this text are still legible. The poverty of Laneham‚Äôs former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached: :There‚Äôs nothing here but poverty, :Scottish rags and hunger; :If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here :Surely it was in anger. The writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the ‚Äòshamefully small‚Äô stipend of ¬£50 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector ‚Äì usually well-connected ‚Äì who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well- connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10 shillings (¬£0.50) a week ‚Äì so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham‚Äôs rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place ‚Äì without success. To make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him. Some of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \\"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story. A few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women ‚Äòhad words‚Äô in the street and then took to blows in a ‚Äòdesperate encounter‚Äô, which ended with one at death‚Äôs door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local ‚Äòruffians‚Äô were found ‚Äòabsolutely roasting‚Äô a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened. Local boys made good Laneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught ‚Äòshoplifting‚Äô from the ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô shop they ran. George (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner‚Äôs letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George‚Äôs most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School. Enoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child‚Äôs Hill, Middlesex. He was living ‚Äòabove the shop‚Äô in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors. Suspected murder case Laneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p. 872) Most of the farm was left to Draper‚Äôs younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop'). Draper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. ‚ÄúFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,‚Äù The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an ‚Äòaperture‚Äô in the window. In 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head. Draper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched ‚Äì she had ¬£40, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood‚Äôs cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper‚Äôs head had seemed ‚Äòsoft and boggy‚Äô on one side. It was decided to exhume him. The body was dug up and placed in ‚Äòan empty tenement‚Äô near the church while the coroner‚Äôs inquest ‚Äì with a jury ‚Äì met at the Butcher‚Äôs Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant ‚Äì ‚Äúthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,‚Äù The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that ‚Äòthere was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.‚Äô Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery. Laneham drainage In December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer John Grundy, Jr. to investigate the possibility of draining some of land on the west bank of the River Trent, stretching from Laneham to West Burton. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture. The landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an Act of Parliament to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that would be improved by the scheme, which would cost ¬£2,700 for the catchwater drain, ¬£6,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, ¬£2,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional ¬£1,200 for the side drains, and ¬£900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of ¬£14,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received ¬£329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published. The Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a scoop wheel, and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from Spalding, at a cost of ¬£458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around ¬£15,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met. The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's Report Books, which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the University of Leeds in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11. The drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was in diameter and wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an Allen-Gwynnes electric pump. With the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, most land drainage authorities were superseded by Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of of low-lying land. They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain. In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.

Fighter kites in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan fly on abrasive string called manja (or manjha). In Brazil, similar string is called \\"cerol\\", and in Chile \\"hilo curado\\". Kites are typically flown in specific seasons or festivals. All flyers will use coloured manja line, coated with powdered glass, and attempt to cut down opposing kites - which will drift away.

So-called \\"chemical manja\\" or \\"Chinese manja\\" is a relatively recent introduction. It is based on non biodegradable synthetic fibers. This makes it harder to break, which can be seen as unsportsman-like, and makes the string more dangerous to bystanders and birds.  Safety and risks  There are a ranges of risk associated with flying fighter kites, many directly around the use of manja. Tati Fighters often fly the kites from rooftops, which poses risks to their safety. Kite runners Kite runners gazing at the kite while following it often lose focus of their surroundings and they may run onto roads or train tracks without paying attention to oncoming traffic or trains. They may also run risks by scaling trees and buildings in order to retrieve kites that land there, where they may fall as a result. Bystanders being cut Others are also at risk, with many reports of motorcyclists and others having their throats cut by manja - especially when driving through hanging strings. These sorts of incidents have led to calls for bans of the sale of glass-coated kite string in many regions. The Chamber of Deputies of Chile enacted a law in 2013 forbidding the use of \\"hilo curado\\" by law, with the only exceptions being for professional kite flyers in secured locations for competitive use, using strings coated with silicon powder. In 2010, one report said that the ban on Chinese manja in India did not work to curb its sale.  Threat to birds  Manja is also dangerous to birds as kites that land in trees do not allow for the strings to break apart easily, frequently causing injuries that require their rescue. A pair of volunteer bird medics in New Delhi care for about 1,000 black kites each year, 90% of which are injured by manja and half of which die. At the Uttarayan festival, veterinarians had to repeatedly respond to situations where birds had been injured.Sources:   References Category:Kites ","title":"Manja (kite)"},{"id":"4451671","text":"Leslie Irving Morrow, known as Jeff Morrow (January 13, 1907 - December 26, 1993), was an American actor educated at the Pratt Institute in his native New York City. Morrow was a commercial artist prior to turning to acting. Early in his career, he acted on the Broadway stage using the name Irving Morrow.Irving Morrow (Jeff Morrow) at IBDB Biography=Acting career As early as 1927, aged 20, Morrow acted onstage as Irving Morrow in Pennsylvania. He later appeared in such plays as Penal Law and Once in a Lifetime, as well as repertory in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Morrow spent the late 1940s on the stage and in radio, where he won the title role in the Dick Tracy radio series. He appeared in many Broadway productions, notably Three Wishes for Jamie, Billy Budd, the Maurice Evans production of Macbeth and the Katharine Cornell production of Romeo and Juliet. Morrow turned to film acting relatively late in his career, commencing with the Biblical epic The Robe in 1953. Often parodied as the 'Cro-Magnon Man' for his prominent brow, Morrow spent much of the 1950s appearing in a mix of A-budget films such as Flight to Tangier (1953) and Captain Lightfoot (1955), 'B' Westerns such as The First Texan (1956), and science fiction films as a leader and screen hero. Morrow carried over much of his acting persona from his radio days to his film acting roles, where his ability to rapidly alter both the tone and volume of his voice for dramatic effect frequently gave sound editors fits. He entered the science fiction/monster movie genre with This Island Earth (1955), followed by The Creature Walks Among Us (1956), Kronos (1957) and The Giant Claw (1957). He returned to television for most of his later roles, with six appearances on the religion anthology series, Crossroads. In two episodes, he portrayed the Reverend M.R. Watkinson in \\"In God We Trust\\" and the Reverend Richard C. Smith in the series finale, \\"Half Mile Down\\" (both 1957). Other appearances were on such series as The Rifleman, Bonanza, Wagon Train, My Friend Flicka, The Deputy, and Daniel Boone. He was cast three times in guest- starring roles on Perry Mason as Franz Lachman in the 1962 episode The Case of the Ancient Romeo, as Alex Chase in the 1962 \\"The Case of the Dodging Domino\\" and as Lawton Brent in the 1965 episode \\"The Case of Festive Felon\\". In 1957, Morrow was cast as Jim Bradford in the episode, \\"Blood in the Dust\\", on CBS's Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre. In the story line, Bradford will not back down when a gunman orders him to leave town. His wife Lucy (Claudette Colbert), is particularly distressed because Jim has not shot a weapon since he was in the American Civil War. In 1958-1959, he starred as Bart McClelland, the fictitious supervisor of construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in the syndicated half-hour Western series Union Pacific, based loosely on a film of the same name. In 1960, Morrow played Tob, the older brother of Boaz in the biblical drama, The Story of Ruth. In 1960, he was cast as a geologist (astronaut) in The Twilight Zone episode \\"Elegy\\". During the '60s and onwards, Morrow appeared in such films as Harbor Lights (1963), the Italian comedy Il giovane normale (1969), Blood Legacy (1971), and in a bow to his earlier career, a cameo in the 1971 monster film Octaman for veteran 1950's monster movie writer/director Harry Essex. After the 1974 cancellation of the sitcom The New Temperatures Rising, and completion of filming the low-budget film Fugitive Lovers, Morrow largely retired from acting, though he returned for a 1975 appearance in the series Police Story. His last television role was in 1986, with a guest appearance in The Twilight Zone episode \\"A Day in Beaumont\\". Death He died on December 26, 1993 in Canoga Park, Los Angeles County, California. He was survived by his wife of nearly fifty years, the late actress Anna Karen Morrow, and their daughter, Mrs. Lissa Morrow Christian (born in 1948). His ashes were scattered off the coast of Palos Verdes. Partial filmography * The Robe (1953) as Paulus * Flight to Tangier (1953) as Colonel C. M.

Early life Kenyon was raised in Gawler and Adelaide. He was educated at Saint Ignatius College, South Australia and studied Asian Studies at Flinders University. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Applied Science in Environmental Management at the University of South Australia. After working in a number of positions, including as a jackaroo and union organiser, Kenyon was employed as an advisor to Minister for Mineral Resources and Development Paul Holloway, a position which he held until his election to parliament. Kenyon is linked with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). Parliament Kenyon made his first bid for parliament in his early 20s, as the Labor candidate in the safe Liberal state seat of Heysen at the 1997 state election, achieving a 12.3-point two-party swing. Kenyon was endorsed unopposed as the party's candidate for the electorate of Newland at the 2006 state election, where veteran Liberal MP Dorothy Kotz was retiring. He singled out increasing the use of public transport and addressing youth employment as priorities, and there was some media speculation that his status as a young, relatively conservative father of three would be well-supported in the area of Adelaide known as the \\"Bible Belt\\". To this extent, polls as early as 2005 began showing that Kenyon was in with a real chance of winning the seat, although Kotz had previously held the seat by a fair margin. There was ultimately a landslide result across the city on election day, and he achieved a 12.5-point two-party swing to finish with a 56.8 percent two-party vote, polling more than double the required swing needed to take the seat, claiming victory after only 90 minutes of counting. Kenyon is on the right of the Labor Party, with links to the rightwing Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. He was the only Labor member to state that he would vote against the planned Relationships Bill removing discrimination against gay couples if a conscience vote were granted ‚Äì although in the end he voted for the revised Domestic Partners Bill in 2006. Kenyon used his maiden South Australian House of Assembly speech to criticise the SA Greens environmental credentials, and stating that he does not believe South Australia should accept nuclear waste from other countries, and that burial of waste materials is a suitable option. His maiden speech was also used to speak out against abortion. Kenyon was appointed as Minister for Manufacturing, Innovation and Trade, Minister for Small Business as well as becoming a Member of Executive Council. Kenyon suffered a 4.6-point two-party swing to finish with a 52.2 percent two-party vote at the 2010 state election in Newland. At the 2014 state election, Kenyon's seat became Labor's most marginal on a 51.4 percent two-party vote from a 1.2-point swing. Kenyon quit cabinet following the 2014 election stating he wanted to spend more time with his family.  Nuclear industrial advocacy  Since his election, Kenyon successfully advocated within the Labor party for the expansion of uranium mining with Paul Holloway, including the abandonment of the Three-Mine Policy. In 2007, his advocacy extended beyond uranium mining to the nuclear fuel cycle generally. In an Opinion Editorial for The Australian he wrote: \\"It's time we in the ALP gave up pretending that nuclear energy is Satan's power supply of choice... It's time we stopped repeating the myth that waste is an issue that can't be dealt with.\\" Since that time he has also advocated for the consideration of an expanded nuclear industry in South Australia. In 2015, the Weatherill government initiated the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission. While the Commission was undertaking its work, Kenyon became a public advocate for the importation of spent nuclear fuel to South Australia for storage and disposal. He expressed his belief that the funds raised by such an activity could fund major public infrastructure projects and advance the South Australian economy. Kenyon spoke on the subject at various events, to the media and demonstrated the potential for bi-partisan support in a public meeting with Liberal party senator, Sean Edwards in which he applauded Edwards' submission to the Royal Commission. He noted that Edwards proposition went beyond his own by introducing the potential reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to generate electricity using advanced nuclear reactors. In a 2016 opinion editorial published in The Advertiser, Kenyon wrote that he had been exploring the potential economic benefits of nuclear waste importation since learning that Taiwan had established a $9bn fund to dispense of their spent nuclear fuel while on a delegation there in 2006. Personal life Kenyon is a devout Catholic.

His birth name was Jay John Fox; he was born in Gainesville, Texas. His father, Frank Fox, was white; his mother Sallie (Priddy) Fox was Chickasaw. Edwin and his two brothers, F. Finis and Wallace Carewe were enrolled members of the Chickasaw Nation. He was likely the most prolific of Native American directors of feature films in Hollywood history. Career After brief studies at the Universities of Texas and Missouri and a period of work with regional theatrical groups, Carewe moved to New York City in 1910, where he became a member of the Dearborn Stock Company. Although Jay Fox was his given name, Carewe chose Edwin (from stage actor Edwin Booth) and Carewe from a character he was playing.The New York Times, January 23, 1940, p. 21; Variety January 24, 1940. Carewe was on stage as an actor before he worked for Lubin studios. Later, he directed films for MGM, First National, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and United Artists. During his career, he provided early screen exposure to many actors such as Dolores del R√≠o, Warner Baxter, Francis X. Bushman and Gary Cooper. He directed 58 films including the acclaimed 1928 version of Ramona starring Dolores del R√≠o and Warner Baxter, which was rediscovered and restored by the Library of Congress and had its world premiere at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2014. Carewe and his two brothers, Wallace Fox (a director/producer) and Finis Fox (a scenario writer), were all registered Chickasaw according to the 1907 Chickasaw Rolls. Another of Carewe's notable films was Evangeline in 1929 also with Dolores del R√≠o and written by his brother Finis Fox. Evangeline was based upon the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and earned praise for its exceptional lighting and camera work.The New York Times, August 20, 1929. Although Carewe directed and produced a number of critically and financially successful pictures during the silent era, he was not fully able to make the transition to sound. After resorting to sound remakes of his earlier successes, and later to low-budget and religious films, he made his last feature Are We Civilized? in 1934. Carewe was married three times, twice to actress Mary Akin. By his first wife, Mary Jane Croft (married 9 January 1909 in Toronto, Ontario), he had two daughters, Violette and Mary Jane. During his first marriage to his second wife, Mary Akin, he had two children, Sally Ann and William (born Edwin Gilbert). During his second marriage to Mary Akin, they had one more child, Carol Lee. Death Carewe died from a heart ailment in his Hollywood apartment, and is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.See Edwin Carewe, State of California Standard Certificate of Death, 22 Jan 1940 (filed 24 Jan 1940), Local Registered No. 1904. Although a few writers have said that Carewe had committed suicide, his death certificate actually states arteriosclerosis general and coronary sclerosis as the cause of death. He had a previous condition of coronary thrombosis. Even if suicide had been suspected, the LA County Coroner's Office would have been required by law to perform an autopsy and none was ever performed.

The doctor tells the man that he has to fill out paperwork before receiving any care.

This was a time of profound social instability and continuing civil war which led his government to coexist with that of Pedro Pablo Berm√∫dez, and later with Felipe Santiago Salaverry. Orbegoso was born in Chuquizongo, Huamachuco, on August 25, 1795. His parents were Justo de Orbegoso y Burutar√°n and Francisca Moncada-Galindo y Morales, 4th countess of Olmos. Orbegoso was therefore the 5th count of Olmos. He participated with Jos√© de San Mart√≠n in the war for independence and in the war against Gran Colombia during the government of Jos√© de La Mar. After the collapse of Agust√≠n Gamarra's first government, Orbegoso was elected president in 1833, winning over Pedro Pablo Berm√∫dez, whom Gamarra had preferred as his successor. During his government, he suffered the enmity of Gamarra, who while in exile had supported Berm√∫dez in his eventual presidency. Orbegoso had also to deal with the young Felipe Santiago Salaverry, who overthrew him 1835. Orbegoso, however, did not lose the support of southern Peru and, with the support of then President of Bolivia, Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, he regained his leadership throughout the country and executed Salaverry. In retribution to the support he received from Santa Cruz, he acceded to form the new Peru- Bolivian Confederacy. Santa Cruz assumed the \\"Supreme Protectorship\\" of the confederation and Orbegoso maintained only the presidency of the Republic of North Peru. After being defeated by Gamarra's efforts to regain power with the support of Chile, Orbegoso had to abandon the country, returning later and staying away from an active political life. He died in Trujillo in 1847.

It was published in 1910 by the Gotham-Attucks Music Publishing Company and used by Aida Overton Walker in His Honor the Barber, an African- American road show. According to Perry Bradford, himself a songster and publisher, the song was written about an actual man named Shine who was with George Walker when they were badly beaten during the New York City race riot of 1900. It was later recorded by jazz and jazz influenced artists such as The California Ramblers (their version was very popular in 1924), Louis Armstrong (recorded March 9, 1931 for Okeh Records, catalog No. 41486), Ella Fitzgerald (recorded November 19, 1936 for Decca Records - catalog. No. 1062), Benny Goodman, Harry James, and Frankie Laine (1947 and 1957 - the 1947 version reached No. 9 in the Billboard charts), usually without the explanatory introduction. Bing Crosby & The Mills Brothers recorded the song on February 29, 1932 with Studio orchestra conducted by Victor Young. It was issued on Brunswick Records 11376-A, a 78 rpm record and it is assessed by Joel Whitburn as reaching the No. 7 position in the charts of the day.

It was founded by socialist George Cecil Ives in 1897, as a result of his belief that homosexuals would not be accepted openly in society and must therefore have a means of underground communication.Cook, London and the Culture of Homosexuality 1885-1914, Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp.137-40 The society is named after the location of the battle where the Sacred Band of Thebes was finally annihilated in 338 BC. Establishment and organization George Ives around 1900 In the 1860s, the German lawyer Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, may have been the first modern European to publicly declare his homosexuality. Ulrichs wrote dozens of books and pamphlets that made a crucial argument: The preference for same-sex love is hereditary; therefore it should not be a crime. He introduced the word \\"Uranian\\" as a synonym for homosexual relations, and even demanded that homosexuals be granted the right to marry. Less radical thinkers in Germany, Austria and France began to argue that same-sex attraction and relations between men were a psychological disturbance to be treated by physicians, rather than a crime to be punished by the courts. As a result, by 1876 \\"psychological\\" had become a term that Oscar Wilde and his peers used to describe anything pertaining to gay sex. At the same time, McKenna writes, \\"aestheticism seemed to spring to life, fully formed, towards the end of the 1870s.\\" It was \\"a heady mix of art, idealism and politics, which sought to propagate a new gospel of Beauty.\\" In 1893, shortly after meeting Wilde, George Cecil Ives, a friend of Wilde's whose diaries contain many new details of the writer's life, founded a secret society called the Order of Chaeronea, aimed at promoting 'the Cause'.Neil McKenna, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Arrow Books, 2004 The society was named \\"after the battle where the male lovers of the Theban Band were slaughtered in 338 BC.\\" Ives and other members dated letters and other materials from the year of the battle, so that 1900 would be written as C.2238. Battle of Chaeronea. The 'Rules of Purpose' stated that the Order was to be 'A Religion, A Theory of Life, and Ideal of Duty', although its purpose was primarily political. Members of the Order were 'Brothers of the Faith', and were required to swear under the 'Service of Initiation', that \\"you will never vex or persecute lovers\\" and \\"That all real love shall be to you as sanctuary.\\" The group was male dominated, but did include a few lesbian members.Neil McKenna, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Arrow Books, 2004 At its peak 'the Elect' numbered perhaps two or three hundred, but no membership lists survive. Oscar Wilde was, however, likely an early recruit, along with Lord Alfred Douglas \\"Bosie\\".Neil McKenna, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Arrow Books, 2004 Other members may have included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson. An elaborate system of rituals, ceremonies, a service of initiation, seals, codes, and passwords were established. The Order, according to Ives' notebooks, had a specific purpose, distinct prescriptions and philosophy, and its particular symbolism: the \\"sign-word\\" AMRRHAO and \\"the seal of the double wreath.\\" The prerequisites of membership were indicated to be \\"Zeal, Learning and Discipline.\\" The principle of secrecy was conveyed by the metaphor of \\"The Chain\\" underlining that one should never reveal any information about the order or its members. The writings of Walt Whitman were particularly revered.Keth Stern, Queers in History: The comprehensive encyclopaedia, BenBella Books, 2009 Ives was keen to stress that the Order was to be an ascetic movement, not to be used as a forum for men to meet men for sex, although he accepted a degree of 'passionate sensuality' could take place. He also believed that love and sex between men was a way to undermine the rigid class system, as a true form of democracy.Neil McKenna, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, Arrow Books, 2004 The Secret Society became a worldwide organisation,Keth Stern, Queers in History: The comprehensive encyclopaedia, BenBella Books, 2009 and Ives took advantage of every opportunity to spread the word about the \\"Cause.\\" In Ives' words: > We believe in the glory of passion. We believe in the inspiration of > emotion. We believe in the holiness of love. Now some in the world without > have been asking as to our faith, and mostly we find that we have no answer > for them. Scoffers there be, to whom we need not reply, and foolish ones to > whom our words would convey no meaning. For what are words?

Career The group started in 1995 when Caroline Hoffman (born 7 March 1975) and sisters Ni√±a (born 24 April 1985) and Djem van Dijk (born 23 January 1987) met during a party, where Caroline was performing with a friend. The parents of the van Dijk sisters asked Caroline to become the music teacher of the two girls. A close-knit group was born, starting with street concerts where they accompanied themselves with acoustic guitar and djembe. Their harmonised and contagious African rhythm soon attracted a lot of attention. Treble is unique for its use of a fictitious language, called \\"Treble. As they put it, \\"In order to be able to get emotions across, music does not always require understandable language.\\" The van Dijk sisters were in their early teens when the collaboration with Caroline started, and were therefore better able to pick up foreign languages. Although the girls have been singing in English and occasionally in French, the Treble language still is an integral and important part of their songwriting and performances. After performing in the Netherlands and traveling abroad, the girls recorded their debut single \\"Ramaganana\\" at the end of 2003, which turned out to be the major breakthrough for the trio, reaching the number one slot on the Dutch singles Hit List. To promote the single, Treble hit the streets again. Performing with a placard requesting the listeners purchase their single and bring it to first place, they succeeded. In June 2004, their first album, No Trouble, made its debut. The girls, by then, had a record deal with CNR Music. Backed up by a group of session musicians they show the many different styles Treble has mastered, ranging from ballads to uptempo rock songs. The album is supported by a full theatre tour and several festival appearances. On stage the three girls are accompanied by a three-man live band: Olaf Fase (drums), Emanuel Platino (bass) and Willem Philips (guitar). Their second album Free came out in April 2006. By then, the group has teamed up with World Sound Management from the USA. The American management firm became interested in Treble when the group performed in France during Midem. In true Treble style, the girls weren't invited. They went to France and just hit the streets of Cannes without any planned gigs. The album is recorded in Hawaii and Los Angeles, under the guidance of Keith Olsen. His involvement lead to a much more coherent sound and the inclusion of the Fleetwood Mac song Crystal, which also was produced by Keith Olson in its original form. The band returns to familiar water when they went on a theatre tour (Omne trivium perfectum) and a full festival agenda. Treble will compete in the National Song Festival, which is the national final for the Eurovision Song Contest. Eurovision Song Contest 2006 On 12 March 2006, an overwhelming victory at the National Song Festival in Amsterdam made Treble the Dutch representatives in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens. During a live television show on the Dutch channel NOS, their song \\"Amambanda\\" was chosen as the best by 72% of the viewers. After this, Treble went on tour, planning to visit every country that was to send a contestant to Athens. They succeeded in doing so, but did not qualify from the Semi-Final. Lordi, the Finnish heavy metal band, won the semis and the final. (During their European tour, Treble met Lordi and they became good friends.) After Eurovision The schedule for Treble after the Eurovision Song Contest was relatively unfruitful. A single \\"Fly\\" off the Free album was scheduled as a CD-single, but was later rescheduled to appear only as a download. yet another single \\"Leave Me Alone\\" was scheduled for 2006 but later postponed to early 2007. Djem and Ni√±a van Dijk have both enrolled in the Amsterdam Conservatorium to sharpen their musical skills reducing their participation in Treble. The band eventually split up in March 2010. Each of the girls have decided to make their own solo career in music.

Barnes advanced to three NCAA tournaments at Providence and three consecutive at Clemson before leaving for Texas in 1998. Barnes won his only post-season conference tournament championship to date in 1994, while at Providence. At Clemson, his Tigers spent one week of the 1996-97 season ranked second in the AP Poll, the highest ranking in school history. Texas Barnes was hired by Texas in April 1998, and the basketball program immediately displayed his impact. Despite playing with just seven scholarship players for the majority of the 1998-99 season and opening the season with a 3-8 record, the Longhorns won 16 of their final 21 games, winning the regular season Big 12 conference championship by a two-game margin, and finishing the year at 19-13 and in the NCAA Tournament. Barnes' success at Texas, a traditional football powerhouse, sparked interest in college basketball at the university and throughout the state. At Texas, Barnes won a school-record 402 games and transformed the school into one of the top college basketball programs in the nation. He guided the Longhorns to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances. They reached the Final Four in 2003, their first in over 50 years, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2006 and 2008.

Cuonzo Martin had left for California after the 2013-14 season; his successor, Donnie Tyndall, had been fired after just one season for lying about NCAA violations at his previous stop, Southern Mississippi. Barnes increased the Vols' win total in each of his first four seasons. In 2018, he was named Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year after leading the Volunteers to a share of their first regular-season SEC title in a decade and a spot in the conference championship game, earning his sixth-career conference coach of the year award. In 2018‚Äì19, he was named the Naismith College Coach of the Year after the Vols finished 31‚Äì6 (tying a school record for wins in a season) and reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.

The Court held that, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in most circumstances the government cannot deport someone to a country where they risk being tortured, but refugee claimants can be deported to their homelands if they are a serious security risk to Canadians. Background Manickavasagam Suresh had come to Canada from his native Sri Lanka in 1990, and had been accepted as a refugee under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees on the basis that his life was in danger in Sri Lanka because of his involvement in the struggle for Tamil independence. In 1995, the government rejected his application for permanent resident status on the basis that he was a security risk, and ordered that he be deported. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had claimed that he was a supporter and fundraiser for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a terrorist group in Sri Lanka. The Federal Court of Canada upheld the deportation order. Following this the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued an opinion that declared him a danger to the security of Canada under section 53(1)(b) of the Immigration Act and consequently should be deported. Suresh had been given an opportunity to present written and documentary evidence to the Minister, however, he was not provided with a copy of the memorandum of the immigration officer and he consequently was not provided with the opportunity to respond to the memorandum. Due to this inability to respond Suresh applied for judicial review of the decision. He argued that: # the Minister's decision was unreasonable; # the procedures of the Immigration Act were unfair; # the Immigration Act infringed sections 7, 2(b), and 2(d) of the Charter. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Federal Court, Trial Division. The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of the Court The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court was written By the Court. Section 7 The Court first considered the claim for violation of section 7 of the Charter. The Court agreed that the words \\"everyone\\" within the provision included refugees. It was further held that deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture deprives the refugee of their right to liberty and security of person. The primary issue was whether the deprivation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Court found that section 53(1) is constitutional but that it may be unconstitutional in application. The constitutionality of the deportation depends on a balancing of the likelihood of torture and the objective of combating terrorism. The Court identified fundamental justice to be \\"the basic tenets of our legal system\\" and are determined by a contextual approach that considers the \\"nature of the decision to be made.\\" Here, the Court must balance between the government's interests in combating terrorism and the refugee's interest in not being deported to torture. The test proposed by the Court was whether the deprivation would \\"shock the Canadian conscience\\". That is, whether \\"the conduct fundamentally unacceptable to our notions of fair practice and justice\\" (this test was first developed in Canada v. Schmidt, 1987). The Court found that the Minister should generally decline to deport refugees if there is a substantial risk of torture but that it may be constitutional in exceptional cases. The law is constitutional but administrative decision makers should exercise discretion and usually weigh in favour of the claimant. The Court also considers the \\"international perspective\\" and finds that it too is incompatible with the practice of deportation where there is a risk of torture. In conclusion, the Court finds that the deportation order given by the Minister to be unconstitutional but the provisions of the Immigration Act are constitutional. Vagueness The second ground of appeal was whether terms \\"danger to the security of Canada\\" and \\"terrorism\\" were unconstitutionally vague. The Court held that they were not. Citing R v Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, the Court observes that a vague law will be unconstitutional where it \\"fails to give those who might come within the ambit of the provision fair notice of the consequences of their conduct\\" or where \\"it fails to adequately limit law enforcement discretion.\\" The phrase \\"danger to the security of Canada\\" was found not to be vague. The political nature of the term means that the courts should be careful not to interfere. The Court concludes that \\"danger to the security of Canada\\" means: :a person constitutes a \\"danger to the security of Canada\\" if he or she poses a serious threat to the security of Canada, whether direct or indirect, and bearing in mind the fact that the security of one country is often dependent on the security of other nations. The threat must be \\"serious\\", in the sense that it must be grounded on objectively reasonable suspicion based on evidence and in the sense that the threatened harm must be substantial rather than negligible. As well, the Court finds that the word \\"terrorism\\" is not unconstitutionally vague. Though the word has no clear definition, it is possible to set boundaries to the meaning. The Court adopts the definition from the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which defines it as: :an act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act. Procedural fairness The court applied the five-question framework from Baker to determine the level of procedural protection required by s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in this case. The court finds that Suresh was not owed \\"a full oral hearing or a complete judicial process.\\"Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, para. 121 However, the court finds that Suresh was owed a level of procedural protection greater than that required by the act (no protection whatsoever) and greater than that which Suresh received. Specifically, the court found that a person facing deportation to torture under s. 53(1)(b) of the Immigration Act should receive a copy of the material on which the Minister is basing their decision, subject to valid reasons for reduced disclosure such as safeguarding public security documents, and that an opportunity be provided for the person to respond to the case presented to the Minister. Furthermore, the refugee who is being deported has the right to challenge the information of the Minister, including the right to present evidence.Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, para. 123 Remedy The court finds that because Suresh made a prima facie case that he would be subject to torture upon being returned to Sri Lanka and because he was denied the procedural fairness owed to him by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the case should be returned to the Minister for reconsideration in accordance with proper procedure.Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, para. 130 See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) * Ahani v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 72; 2002 SCC 2 - accompanying case to Suresh * non-refoulement * Suresh Joachim Canadian work for peace ReferencesExternal links * Court documents and more background information The Hague Justice Portal * * Federal Court of Appeal decision Category:Canadian immigration and refugee case law Category:Canadian administrative case law Category:Canadian freedom of expression case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Section Seven Charter case law Category:Torture in Canada Category:2002 in Canadian case law Category:2002 in international relations Category:Deportation from Canada ","title":"Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)"},{"id":"4451870","title":"Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's 100 metre freestyle"},{"id":"4451883","title":"Anthony Mackie"},{"id":"4451892","text":"John Wilson Vermillion (1842‚Äì1911), also known as \\"Texas Jack\\" or later as \\"Shoot-Your-Eye-Out Vermillion\\", was a gunfighter of the Old West known for his participation in the Earp Vendetta Ride and his later association with Soapy Smith.  Early life  Vermillion was born in 1842 in Russell County, Virginia, the second of 12 children born to William and Nancy Vermillion (n√©e Owens). He was a Confederate Civil War veteran and fought under the command of General Joseph Wheeler and Nathan Bedford Forrest. After the war, Jack went to Indiana, where he married Margaret Horton in September, 1865. They moved to Missouri, where Jack accepted the position as Territorial Marshal for the eastern section of Missouri. Jack's wife and two young children (a daughter and son) died in a diphtheria epidemic in Missouri, while Jack was away.Bio page on Vermillion, including a photo of him in old age with his second wife, taken circa 1910.  Out West  Vermillion wound up in Kansas in the late 1870s. From Dodge City, Kansas, he went to Tombstone, Arizona (Arizona Territory), where he possibly previously knew the Earps and Doc Holliday. He was listed by Virgil Earp as special policeman (i.e., deputy city policeman) June 22, 1881. This is the day of the large Tombstone fire of 1881, with which Virgil had to cope as acting city marshal; the date suggests that Jack is one of the extra men Virgil hired to help cope with looting, during and after the disaster. Nickname The origin of Texas Jack, Vermillion's nickname, is unknown, but he is first listed by this moniker on a wanted poster, for shooting a man during an argument at cards. When asked about why he was called Texas Jack, he replied: \\"Because I'm from Virginia\\".  Earp Vendetta Ride  Vermillion did not accompany Virgil Earp as a member of the protective squad which escorted him to Tucson, on March 20, 1882. Instead, Vermillion joined the vendetta posse March 21, 1882 in Tombstone, a day after the killing of Frank Stilwell in Tucson; thus Vermillion was not one of the five men indicted for Stilwell's killing. He presumably did participate in the killing of Florentino Cruz on March 22. Vermillion had his horse shot out from under him during the fight at Iron Springs (March 24), in which \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius was killed. Vermillion was himself not hit in that fight, but he had to be picked up by Doc Holliday after exposing himself to fire from the cowboys, while trying to retrieve the rifle wedged under his fallen horse. This episode, combined with Wyatt's memory in the Flood manuscript and Vermillion's family history suggest that Vermillion may have participated in the Earp posse more as a friend of Holliday's, who was a fellow Methodist and fellow southerner. Note that Holliday's father had also served as a Confederate soldier. In the unpublished 1926 John H. Flood manuscript of Wyatt Earp's biography, Vermillion is mentioned (as \\"Texas Jack\\") several times as not being a close friend of the Earps', but rather a relative stranger. This fact caused Wyatt some chagrin in memory, since Vermillion stayed by him at Iron Springs when the other three men in his posse at the time (Holliday, Johnson, and McMasters) fled under fire. (Warren Earp was away on an errand for the posse.).  Dodge City war  In 1883, Vermillion was involved with the Dodge City War. Sometime during Jack's stay in Dodge he killed a card cheat. This is when he appears on the wanted poster as Texas Jack Vermillion. Sometime between 1883 and 1889, perhaps due to this charge, his handle of \\"Texas Jack\\" changed to \\"Shoot-Your-Eye-Out-Jack\\" Vermillion. Reportedly, he had shot a man in the eye.  Later life  Sometime around 1890, Vermillion returned permanently to Virginia, settled near the town of Big Stone Gap, and worked as a Methodist preacher. He and his second wife, Nannie Fleenor (whom he wed in 1883?), had a son, Opie Vermillion, and a daughter, Minnie Bell Vermillion.  Death John Wilson Vermillion Photos 1861 and 1910 Vermillion is said in many sources (including Earp's biography by Flood, which is probably the primary source for the information) to have drowned in Lake Michigan near Chicago, about 1900. Young states that Vermillion's body was returned to Virginia for burial, but Flood does not say this, and Young does not cite his source. A self-published but useful compendium of biographical information on minor Tombstone characters. Young may have assumed the body was returned, since there is evidence that Vermillion is buried in Virginia (see below). In contrast to the ca. 1900 drowning theory, Vermillion family records suggest that Jack Vermillion died peacefully in his sleep in 1911. A photograph of him and his second wife ca. 1910 survives in the family record. A John W. Vermillion (farmer) is also listed in the 1910 census in Washington Co., Virginia (this is just South of Russell County and the town of Big Stone Gap). This man, listed as aged 66, is listed as being born in Virginia, married in Virginia, 35 years(?) to wife Nannie. Whether or not this is the same man is not definitely known. The implied birth date would be wrong, but reasonably close (circa 1844, not 1842); however, the given marriage date would be far off (35 years from 1910 is 1875, not 1883). The place of residence is in the same relatively small area in the western tail of Virginia where Texas Jack was born and is said in other sources to have returned. The issue is not resolved. Visually, the elderly man in the 1910 photograph could well be the young J.W. Vermillion from the Civil War photo (see comparison photo). According to Vermillion family history, Jack killed a man in a gunfight in 1890 and was forced to move 60 miles east to Mendota, Virginia, in Washington County (which fits with the census report), where he spent the rest of his days. John W. Vermillion's grave and that of his wife are in the Mendota Cemetery. Contains photo of John W. Vermillion tombstone in the Mendota cemetery, and some photos of surviving Vermillion family. Portrayals in the media Vermillion appears as a minor character in most Wyatt Earp films. For example, he is portrayed in Hour of the Gun (1967) by actor William Windom and in Tombstone (1993) by actor Peter Sherayko.

The ride is in mid-cycle, and the riders are stuck to the wall of the barrel by the force of friction due to centrifugal force. The yellow lines on the barrel wall indicate the level the floor is at during different points of the ride; the higher line is level with the floor when the ride begins. The Rotor is an amusement park ride, designed by German engineer Ernst Hoffmeister in the late 1940s. The ride was first demonstrated at Oktoberfest 1949, and was exhibited at fairs and events throughout Europe during the 1950s and 1960s. The ride still appears in numerous amusement parks, although travelling variants have been surpassed by the Gravitron. Design and operation The Rotor is a large, upright barrel, rotated at 33 revolutions per minute. The rotation of the barrel creates a centrifugal effect equivalent to almost 3 g. Once the barrel has attained full speed, the floor is retracted, leaving the riders stuck to the wall of the drum. At the end of the ride cycle, the drum slows down and gravity takes over. The riders slide down the wall slowly. Most Rotors were constructed with an observation deck. Although Hoffmeister was the designer, most Rotors were constructed under license. In Australia, the Rotors were built by Ted Hopkins of Luna Park Milsons Point. In the United States, two main companies were responsible for production; the Velare Brothers and the Anglo Rotor Corporation. A dispute between these two companies was resolved when the construction rights to touring Rotors were assigned to the Velare Brothers, while permanent-standing Rotors (later becoming known as Chance Rotors) became the domain of ARC.

Cold Dark Matter (An Exploded View) 1991 In contrast, in 1997 at the Turner Prize exhibition, Parker exhibited Mass (Colder Darker Matter) (1997), suspending the charred remains of a church that had been struck by lightning in Texas. Eight years later, Parker made a companion piece \\"Anti-Mass\\" (2005), using charcoal from a black congregation church in Kentucky, which had been destroyed by arson. The Maybe (1995) at the Serpentine Gallery, London, was a performance piece conceived by Tilda Swinton, who lay, apparently asleep, inside a vitrine. She asked Parker to collaborate with her on the project, and to create an installation in which she could sleep. Swinton's original idea was to lie in state as Snow White in a glass coffin, but through the collaboration with Cornelia the idea evolved into her appearing as herself and not as an actor posing as a fictional character. Parker filled the Serpentine with glass cases containing relics that belonged to famous historical figures, such as the pillow and blanket from Freud's couch, Mrs. Simpson's ice skates, Charles Dickens' quill pen and Queen Victoria's stocking. A version of the piece was later re-performed in Rome (1996) and then MoMA, New York (2013) without Parker's involvement. Parker has made other interventions involving historical artworks. For example, she wrapped Rodin's The Kiss sculpture in Tate Britain with a mile of string (2003) as her contribution to the 2003 Tate Triennial Days Like These at Tate Britain. The intervention was titled The Distance (A Kiss With String Attached). She re-staged this intervention as part of her mid-career retrospective at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, in 2015. Subconscious of a Monument (2005) is composed of fragments of dry soil, which are suspended on wires from the gallery ceiling.

Embryo Firearms, 1995. Colt 45 guns in the earliest stage of production Avoided Object is the title of an ongoing series of smaller works which have been developed in liaison with various institutions, including the Royal Armouries, British Police Forces and Madame Tussauds. These \\"avoided\\" objects have often had their identities transformed by being burned, shot, squashed, stretched, drawn, exploded, cut, or simply dropped off cliffs. Cartoon deaths have long held a fascination for Parker: \\"Tom being run over by a steamroller or Jerry riddled with bullet holes. Sometimes the object's demise has been orchestrated, or it may have occurred accidentally or by natural causes. They might be 'preempted' objects that have not yet achieved a fully formed identity, having been plucked prematurely from the production line like Embryo Firearms 1995. They may not even be classified as objects: things like cracks, creases, shadows, dust or dirt The Negative of Whispers 1997: Earplugs made with fluff gathered in the Whispering Gallery, St Paul's Cathedral). Or they might be those territories you want to avoid psychologically, such as the backs, underbellies or tarnished surfaces of things.\\" Another example of this work is Pornographic Drawings (1997), using ink made by the artist who used solvent to dissolve (pornographic) video tape, confiscated by HM Customs and Excise. In 2009, for the opening of Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Edinburgh, Parker created a firework display titled Nocturne: A Moon Landing containing a lunar meteorite. Therefore the moon landed on Jupiter. The following year Parker made Landscape with Gun and Tree for Jupiter Artland, a nine metre tall cast iron and Corten steel shotgun leaning against a tree. Inspired by the painting \\"Mr and Mrs Andrews\\" by Thomas Gainsborough where Mr Andrews poses with a gun slung over his arm. The shotgun used in the piece is a facsimile of the one owned by Robert Wilson, one of the founders of Jupiter Artland. Folkestone Harbour Mermaid For the Folkestone Triennial in 2011, Parker created a Folkestone version of one of the popular tourist attractions in Copenhagen, Little Mermaid. Through a process of open submission, Parker chose Georgina Baker, mother of two and Folkestone born and bred. Unlike the idealised Copenhagen version, this is a life-size, life-cast sculpture, celebrating the local and the everyday.

The top-left corner of Magna Carta (An Embroidery) To celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, Parker created Magna Carta (An Embroidery), a hand embroidered representation of the Wikipedia article Magna Carta as it was on 15 June 2014, completed in 2015. Whilst Magna Carta (An Embroidery) was on display at the British Library, Parker presented One More Time, a Terrace Wires commission for St Pancras International Station, London, co-presented by HS1 Ltd. and the Royal Academy of Arts. Embroiderers included members of the Embroiderers Guild, HM prisoners, Peers, MP‚Äôs, judges, human rights lawyers, a US ambassador and his staff, and various personalities including Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Jimmy Wales, Jarvis Cocker and Doreen Lawrence. In 2016 Parker became the first female artist to be commissioned to create a new work for the Roof Garden of the Met in New York. Transitional Object (PsychoBarn) is a scaled down replica of the house from the 1960 Hitchcock film ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù and was constructed using a salvaged red barn. Parker continued her work as a curator for the Found exhibitionhttps://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/found/ for The Foundling Museum, which incorporated sixty-eight artists from an array of creative disciplines, as well as contributing her own piece, A Little Drop of Gin. This limited-edition print, nicknamed 'mother's ruin', was a photogravure using a 1750s gin glass and droppings of gin. Parker was named Artist of the Year in the 2016 Apollo Awards for her involvement and contributions in the art world. Parker appeared in the BBC Four television series What Do Artists Do All Day?, a BBC Scotland production, first broadcast in 2013. In the programme she talks about her life and work. In May 2015, Parker was included in the Brilliant Ideas series broadcast by Bloomberg TV in which she reveals her inspirations and discusses some of her best-loved works. In summer 2016, BBC One broadcast \\"Danger! Cornelia Parker\\" as part of the TV series Imagine. In autumn 2016 she was included in Gaga for Dada, a programme to mark the 100th anniversary of Dada, presented by Vic Reeves. She also contributed to the BBC Four production Bricks! broadcast on 21 September 2016, marking the 40th anniversary of Carl Andre's sculpture Equivalent VIII, better known as 'The Tate Bricks'. On 1 May 2017 Parker was chosen as the official election artist for the 2017 United Kingdom general election; she was the first woman in that job. In November 2019 Parker opened her first major retrospective exhibition in Australia at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney for the Tenth Sydney International Art Series, featuring over 40 artworks spanning the artists' career. Curatorial In 2011 Parker curated an exhibition titled Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain for the Collections Gallery at the Whitechapel Gallery in London using selected works from the Government Art Collection arranged as a colour spectrum. For the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 2014, Parker curated the Black and White Room which included a number of well-known artists who she thought should be future Royal Academicians. In 2016, as part of her Hogarth Fellowship at the Foundling Museum, Parker curated a group exhibition titled FOUND presenting works from over sixty artists from a range of creative disciplines, asked to respond to the theme of ‚Äòfound‚Äô, reflecting on the Museum‚Äôs heritage. Recognition In 2010 Parker was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts, London and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In 2000, 2005 and 2008 she received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Gloucestershire respectively. Parker won the Artist of the Year Apollo Award in 2016. Other shortlisted artists were Carmen Herrera, David Hockney, Ragnar Kjartansson, Jannis Kounellis and Helen Marten. Parker was named as the official Election Artist for the 2017 general election in the United Kingdom. In this role she observed the election campaign leading up to the vote on 8 June, and was required to produce a piece of art in response. Parker created two films and a series of 14 photographic works as a result of this commission, which were previewed on BBC Newsnight on 2 February 2018 and made available online via the UK Parliament website. prior to an exhibition in Westminster Hall. Politics In politics, prior to the 2015 general election, she was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.

This approach to theology seeks to give practical expression to theology. Normally viewed as an \\"equipping\\" of ministers, practical theology is often considered to be more pragmatic than speculative, indeed, essentially a practical science. Hence its main interests are in those areas of theology which will aid clergy in ministry. Topics tend to include homiletics, pastoral care, sacramental theology, and ethics. All branches of theology, whether theoretical or practical, purpose in one way or another to make priests, pastors, and others in a pastoral role \\"the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God\\" (1 Corinthians 4:1). Pastoral theology presupposes other various branches, accepts the apologetic, dogmatic, exegetic, moral, juridical, ascetical, liturgical, and other conclusions reached by the ecclesiastical student, and scientifically applies these various conclusions to the priestly ministry. History During the Middle Ages, there was not yet a separated and systematized science of pastoral theology. Scholasticism did not recognize this science apart from other branches of theology. Dogma and moral were so taught as to include the application of their conclusions to the care of souls. Still, even then writings of the great Doctors of the Church were at times purely pastoral; such were the \\"Pastoral Care\\" of Pope Gregory I; \\"Opuscula\\", 17‚Äì20, of Thomas Aquinas; Bonaventure's \\"De sex alis seraphim\\", \\"De regimine anim√¶\\", \\"Confessionale\\"; the \\"Summa theologica\\" (Books II, III), together with the \\"Summa confessionalis\\" of Antoninus, Bishop of Florence. At the same time, writers on mystical theology have often entered into the domain of pastoral theology. Not until the period of the Counter-Reformation did the science of pastoral theology take its present systematized form. During the latter half of the fifteenth century, in certain places, pastoral duties were very much neglected. By the dawn of the sixteenth century, the care of souls was to many priests and not a few bishops a lost or a never-acquired art, with the result that the laity were ready to throw off what was deemed to be a useless clerical yoke. The Council of Trent set itself to bring about a true reformation of the priesthood. Catholic bishops and theologians followed the lead of the council. The result was the treatment of the care of souls as a science by itself.

It was described by a number of ancient sources, including a lost work by Callixenus of Rhodes and surviving texts by Athenaeus and Plutarch. According to these descriptions, supported by modern research by Lionel Casson, the enormous size of the vessel made it impractical and it was built only as a prestige vessel, rather than an effective warship. The name \\"forty\\" refers not to the number of oars, but to the number of rowers on each column of oars that propelled it, and at the size described it would have been the largest ship constructed in antiquity, and probably the largest human- powered vessel ever built. Sources Ptolemy IV, who ordered the ship built The \\"forty\\" was reportedly built by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt in the 3rd century BC. It was first described by his contemporary Callixenus of Rhodes in the lost Peri Alexandreias. In the early-3rd century AD, Athenaeus quotes this in his Deipnosophistae. Plutarch, writing in the late 1st century AD, also mentioned this immense vessel in his Life of Demetrius, part of his Parallel Lives series, disagreeing or misquoting slightly on the height to top of stern, which he reports as forty-eight cubits: Note that the translation of \\"forty banks\\" is overliteral; see below. Configuration of the oars Greek trireme. The trireme, a three-ranked galley with one man per oar, was the main Hellenistic warship up to and into the 4th century BC. At that time, a requirement for heavier ships led to the development of \\"polyremes\\" meaning \\"many oars\\", applied to \\"fours\\" (tetre- in Greek, quadri- in Latin) or more and \\"fives\\" (penta- in Greek, quinque- in Latin) and later up to \\"tens\\", the largest that seems to have been used in battle. Larger polyremes were built, with Ptolemy II Philadelphus eventually building a \\"twenty\\" and a \\"thirty\\", and Ptolemy IV Philopator building the \\"forty\\". The maximum practical number of oar ranks a ship could have logistically was three (Greek and Latin tri-). Beyond three, the number in the type name did not refer to the number of ranks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes, respectively two and three ranks of oars with one rower per oar), but to the number of rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. Indeed, just because a ship was designated with a larger type number did not mean it necessarily had or operated all three possible ranks: the quadrireme may have been a simple evolution of a standard trireme, but with two rowers on the top oar; it may also have been a bireme with two men on each oar; or it may just have had a single rank with four men on a each single oar. Classes of ship could differ in their configuration between regions and over time, but in no case did a \\"four\\" ship have four horizontal ranks of oars. From galleys used in the 16th to 18th centuries AD, it is known that the maximum number of men that can operate a single oar efficiently is eight. Further, Casson writes that the oars were the proper length for no more than eight rowers. Mention by Callixenus of the \\"forty's\\" thranite (the uppermost rowing level of a trireme) oars leads Casson to determine that the \\"forty\\" had three ranks. He points to the practical limit of eight rowers to an oar, giving a maximum size class of \\"twenty-four\\", as well as to the need for a vastly larger deck than one ship could provide in order to accommodate the reported numbers of marines. Combined with Callixenus description of the ship having two heads and two sterns, Casson suggests that the \\"forty\\" must have been a catamaran made up of two three-ranked \\"twenties\\" joined together by a deck. Each column or section of the ship would be composed of twenty rowers; perhaps eight rowers on each section's top rank, seven in the middle, and five on the bottom rank. Specifications catamaran hulls, as Casson suggests As a catamaran of two \\"twentys\\" with 4,000 oarsmen, there would be 2,000 per hull and therefore 1,000 per side. The 130m length would allow ample room for the 50 vertical sections of three oars each, with each vertical section accommodating 20 rowers (hence the designation \\"twenty\\"). Thus there would be 150 oars per side. Casson has suggested that it was possible that the two internal sides were not equipped with oars and that the rowers there acted as reserve crew for those on the outer side, so the \\"forty\\" would have had either 300 or 600 oars. Details Source: * Length: 280 cubits, * Beam: 38 cubits, (per catamaran hull if Casson is correct) * Height from waterline to tip of stern: 53 cubits, * Height from waterline to tip of prow: 48 cubits, * Length of steering oars (4): 30 cubits, * Longest rowing oars: 38 cubits, * Oarsmen: 4,000 * Officers, ratings, deckhands: 400 * Marines: 2,850 Use It had seven naval rams, with one primary, and the deck would have provided a stable platform for catapults that were often mounted on supergalleys. However, the \\"forty\\" was likely just a showpiece; Plutarch describes the ship as for exhibition only. Launch In order to launch the huge ship the engineers devised a ‚Äì then novel ‚Äì dry dock construction: It has been calculated that the dock might have needed around 750,000 gallons of water to lift up the vessel.

The objectives of this Association were \\"promoting by every legitimate means the political, intellectual and material advancement of the people\\". The Association attracted educated Indians and civic leaders from all parts of the country, and became an important forum for India's aspirations for independence. It later merged with the Indian National Congress. Timeline Indian Association formed in 1876 was one of the pioneer political associations with an all India outlook. During the second half of the 19th century, India witnessed marked changes in social and economic life. One of the striking developments of this time was the growth of political consciousness leading to the birth of political associations and national movements for independence. Prior to the Indian Association, Sisir Kumar Ghosh along with Sambhu Charan Mukherjee founded 'The India League' in Calcutta on 25 September 1875. The nationalist leaders like Ananda Mohan Bose, Durga Mohan Das, Nabagopal Mitra, Surendranath Banerjee and others were associated with this organisation. The League represented the middle class and worked to stimulate the sense of nationalism among the people and to encourage political education. With a broad vision of an all India outlook, the leaders kept the organisation above narrow provincial and communal politics. But soon the League foundered and shortly afterwards Surendranath Banerjee founded the Indian Association along with his friend Ananda Mohan Bose on 26 September 1876. The leaders who were associated with this organisation were Sivanath Sastri, Kristodas Pal, Dwarakanath Ganguly, Narendra Kishore, and others. Rev Krishna Mohan Banerjee and Ananda Mohan Bose were elected the first President and Secretary respectively of the Association. There was not much difference between the India League and the Indian Association in objectives and outlook. Both of them had worked to help the growth of national awakening and political unity among the educated middle class in India. The very name 'Indian Association' implied that national movement was assuming an all India character in outlook and approach. The Association started its programme with a number of objects: (a) the creation of a strong body of public opinion in the country; (b) the unity of the Indian races and peoples on the basis of common political interest and aspirations; (c) the promotion of friendly feeling between Hindus and Muslims and (d) the inclusion of the masses in the great public movement of the time. Prior to Indian National Association, there was no political organisation in Bengal that represented the interest of the middle class and the raiyats. The Association gave the young middle-class community a political platform on a more democratic basis. The leaders of the Association were mostly educated young men, lawyers, and journalists. Surprisingly it did not include big business leaders and landlords as members. In the words of Anil Seal, the Indian Association had worked as a pressure group for graduates and professional men, which claimed to represent 'The middle class'. Being founded by moderate leaders like Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose, who were also at the helm of its affairs, the Association was above extreme and narrow Hindu nationalism and parochialism. As a gesture of friendship and goodwill towards the Muslims, they invited Nawab Mohammad Ali to preside over its second annual conference. Indeed, the Indian Association had laid the foundation for the growth of national awakening and political consciousness that ultimately saw the establishment of the Indian national congress in 1885, and for this Surendranath Banerjea deserves credit. In fact, the Association was the forerunner of the Congress. Right from its birth, the Association started its work in right earnest. The reduction of age limit (1877) from 21 to 19 years for the candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination gave it an excellent opportunity to start an all India movement. Under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjee, the Association strongly protested against this unjust decision. Surendranath was chosen as a special delegate to visit different parts of India to secure support for the memorial that the Association intended to send to British Parliament. Surendranath's tour of India was a great success. It enkindled a new spirit of nationalism, which helped to create a feeling of national unity on important political issues. He was the first politician to receive all India popularity. Under his able leadership, the Association demanded simultaneous holding of civil service examination in England and India and Indianisation of higher administrative posts. Besides, the Association led the campaign against the repressive arms act (1878), the vernacular press act, and the exemption of duties on cotton goods. Public meetings were held in Calcutta demanding the removal of racial inequality between Indians and Europeans and reduction of the salt tax. The Association gave its support to the Bengal tenancy act of 1885 and demanded self Government in India. It is true that with the establishment of the Indian National Congress, the Association gradually lost much of its political importance. Yet it must be given the credit for initiating the idea of holding an all India conference with representatives from every province. The first Indian National Conference was accordingly held in Calcutta in 1883. The second National Conference, organised by the Association, held in 1885 in Calcutta. It coincided with that of the National Congress, which was meeting for the first time in Bombay in December 1885. The Indian Association expressed its solidarity and decided its merger with the Congress when the National Congress was organising its second annual conference in Calcutta in December 1886. It is true that the Indian Association lost its earlier political importance as soon as Congress began to function as an all India organisation. Even then when the partition of Bengal (1905) occurred, the Association under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjea became very active. The Association, under the leadership of Surendranath, organised the Boycott and swadeshi movement against the partition, raised a National Fund, drew up a National Educational Policy and, in 1906, formally inaugurated the National Council of Education. Violent agitation compelled the government to revoke the partition of Bengal in December 1911. After the annulment of the partition, the Indian Association lost much of its political importance and continued its existence being engaged mainly in social works.

If the opponent players do manage to pile onto the character holding the ball, the play stops and the team goes back to the previous line. A quirk in the gameplay allows the defensive player to get an easy sack if they dive with the nose tackle at the precise moment the ball is snapped.

When the optical power from a wavelength impacts the refractive index, the impact of the new refractive index on another wavelength is known as XPM.  Applications of XPM  Cross-phase modulation can be used as a technique for adding information to a light stream by modifying the phase of a coherent optical beam with another beam through interactions in an appropriate non-linear medium. This technique is applied to fiber optic communications. XPM is among the most commonly used techniques for quantum nondemolition measurements. Other advantageous applications of XPM include: *Nonlinear optical Pulse Compression of ultrashort pulses *Passive mode-locking *Ultrafast optical switching *Demultiplexing of OTDM channels *Wavelength conversion of WDM channels Disadvantages of XPM = XPM in DWDM applications  In dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) applications with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM-DD), the effect of XPM is a two step process: First the signal is phase modulated by the copropagating second signal. In a second step dispersion leads to a transformation of the phase modulation into a power variation. Additionally, the dispersion results in a walk-off between the channels and thereby reduces the effect of XPM. *XPM leads to interchannel crosstalk in WDM systems *It can produce amplitude and timing jitter  See also  * Self-phase modulation -- SPM * Four wave mixing -- FWM * Stimulated Raman scattering -- SRS * Cross- polarized wave generation -- XPW External links * Cross-phase modulation (RP Photonics, Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology) Category:Nonlinear optics Category:Fiber optics ","title":"Cross-phase modulation"},{"id":"4452005","text":"Drowned lands is a name sometimes given to seasonally flooded areas, or to areas flooded by reservoirs.

The creek originates in Nunawading near Springvale Road, and flows to join the Yarra at the border between Ivanhoe East, Bulleen and Balwyn North. The place the two waterways meet forms the borders between these suburbs. Bushy Creek (now carried by an underground pipe) is a tributary to the creek, joining near Elgar Park in Mont Albert North. A shared use path follows the course of the creek (and therefore also the Freeway), known as the Koonung Creek Trail. Melbourne Water rates the condition of the creek as 'Very Poor'. Also according to Melbourne Water, the river is the unhealthiest waterway in Melbourne. Melbourne Water's monitoring station for the creek at Bulleen Road in Bulleen, detected an average E. coli count of 1800, this is nine times the safe swimming level (200). This was the highest level of E. coli measured in all of metropolitan Melbourne's waterways. The poor condition of the creek has been evident from the earliest days of European settlement. Five species of frog call the creek home, these are the Common Eastern Froglet, the Spotted Marsh Frog, the Striped Marsh Frog, the Eastern or Pobblebonk Frog and the Southern Brown or Ewing's Tree Frog. The Eastern Freeway follows the path of the creek within the band of parkland that adjoins the creek over its entire length. Geography The creek's headwaters meet near the borders of Nunawading and Donvale, 21 km east of Melbourne. From here, the creek flows in a roughly westerly direction for around 11 km, before reaching the Yarra River below the Yarra Flats in southern Bulleen.

It is located along the subterranean Kissena Creek, which flows into the Flushing River. It is bordered on the west by Kissena Boulevard; on the north by Rose, Oak, Underhill, and Lithonia Avenues; on the east by Fresh Meadow Lane; and on the south by Booth Memorial Avenue. The park contains the city's only remaining velodrome, a lake of the same name, two war memorials, and various playgrounds and sports fields. The site of Kissena Park was originally part of a tree nursery operated by Samuel Parsons in the late 19th century, though parts of the park were also the site of a Long Island Rail Road line. The lake on Parsons's property was named \\"Kissena\\", which comes from the Chippewa language meaning \\"it is cold\\", \\"cold place\\", or \\"cool water\\", and the park was later named after the lake. After Parsons died in 1906, part of his former nursery was incorporated in the modern-day park. The name \\"Kissena Park\\" can also refer to a residential section of Flushing just north of the park. Kissena Park opened in 1910, and it was incorporated into Kissena Corridor Park in the mid-1950s. Various improvement projects have been conducted during Kissena Park's history, including the addition of the velodrome in 1962 and restorations of the lake in 1942 and 1983. Subsequently, the Kissena Velodrome was restored and rededicated in 2004, and a Korean War memorial was dedicated in 2007. Description Kissena Park is bounded by Booth Memorial Avenue to the south; Kissena Boulevard to the west; Rose, Oak, Underhill, and Lithonia Avenues to the north; and Fresh Meadows Lane to the east. The south side of the park is mostly meadow land. Kissena Park contains a small lake, Kissena Lake, on the northeast corner. Formerly a wetland, it was transformed into a \\"bathtub lake\\" during a 1942 renovation. A freshwater marsh is located on the southern shore of the lake. The Historic Grove is located on a site on the north end of the park, and contains trees from a nursery that formerly occupied the park site. It contains an old-growth forest that existed prior to the park's creation. The Kissena Velodrome, at the center of the park, is used for track cycling and is the city's only remaining bicycle track. The velodrome hosts multiple bicycling programs, including Star Track. The rest of the park contains various playgrounds, soccer fields, tennis courts, and baseball fields. A Korean War memorial is located at a northern entrance to Kissena Park, at Parsons Boulevard and Rose Avenue. Another memorial, a boulder with an inscription dedicated to World War I soldiers from Queens, is located on the southern shore of Kissena Lake. Kissena Park is located in the center of the Kissena Corridor Park, a mostly continuous chain of parks several miles long, and is part of the Brooklyn- Queens Greenway. The corridor, in turn, runs along the path of a former Long Island Rail Road line that was originally known as Central Railroad of Long Island. A plaque commemorating the railroad is located at the northwest corner of the park. Bicycle paths connect the park westward to Main Street. The former Long Island Motor Parkway, now a bike path, connects Kissena Park with Cunningham Park and Alley Pond Park via the Kissena Corridor. Etymology Kissena Park and the adjacent Kissena Corridor Park are named after Kissena Lake. The word \\"Kissena\\" is from the Chippewa language meaning \\"it is cold\\", \\"cold place\\", or \\"cool water\\". The Chippewa (Ojibwe) Native Americans are not native to the New York area, but rather to the Midwestern United States. However, the New York area was inhabited by the Canarsee and Rockaway Lenape groups, who are Algonquian peoples along with the Chippewa. The name was given to the lake by horticulturalist Samuel Bowne Parsons (father of Samuel Parsons Jr.), who operated a nursery near the lake in the late 1800s. Kissena and Kissena Corridor Parks share the name with Kissena Boulevard which runs north- to-south between the two parks, and Kissena Creek, which formerly ran through the park. The area of Flushing surrounding the two parks is also informally known as \\"Kissena Park\\". History Dusk at Kissena Park Origins Kissena Park's natural features were formed during the Wisconsin glaciation, about 20,000 years ago. The site of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, slightly west of Kissena Park, was originally part of the ancestral path of the Hudson River, and the present-day Kissena Lake was located on the eastern shore of the river. The glacier covered much of Long Island, where Queens is located, and formed a terminal moraine through the center of the island. One of these recesses became Kissena Lake. When the glacier receded, it created several recesses in the land, some of which were filled with water. The topography of Flushing and Northeast Queens was formed during this time, including the creation of Kissena Lake. Glaciation also created a natural source of well water for the area. Kissena Lake was part of a watercourse called Kissena Creek, previously known as Mill Creek or Ireland Mill Creek, which ran east- to-west through what are now Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park. The creek began at a swamp in the modern Kew Gardens Hills and Pomonok areas south of Kissena Park. Past the swamp, the creek traveled east parallel to 72nd Avenue, then turning north in modern Fresh Meadows, traveling parallel to today's Utopia Parkway to the modern Kissena Park Golf Course just south of Flushing Cemetery. The creek then turned west through the modern Kissena Park, Kissena Corridor Park, and Queens Botanical Garden sites before meeting Flushing Creek at what is now the Fountain of Planets / Pool of Industry in Flushing Meadows. The system included several lakes, including Kissena Lake, as well as a pond in Fresh Meadows now occupied by the Utopia Playground. The system of waterways was mostly a wetland area. The very first people to occupy the area were the Native Americans, though little evidence remains of their settlements. The site was then settled by Dutch and English settlers who founded the town of Flushing. Parsons Nurseries In 1868, Samuel Parsons opened Parsons Nurseries, one of the earliest commercial gardens, near what is now Fresh Meadows Lane. With help of a team of collectors, Parsons Nurseries found exotic trees and shrubs to import into the United States, and its advertisements filled gardening magazines with depictions of these exotic plants. During the late 1880s, Parsons Nurseries was importing 10,000 Japanese maples into the United States each year with help from Swiss immigrant John R. Trumpy. Parsons Nurseries also was the first to introduce the California privet in the United States from Japan. Kissena Lake was initially used as a mill pond. Parsons later used Kissena Lake for ice cutting, where surface ice from lakes and rivers is collected and stored in ice houses and use or sale as a cooling method before mechanical refrigeration was available. However, as recently as the 1900s, both Kissena Lake and Gutman's Swamp served as a habitat for wood duck. Just east of the lake was a water pumping station. It was used first by the College Point Water Works, then by the Citizens Water Supply Company of Newtown, and finally as a city-owned pumping station. Samuel Parsons's children, Samuel Bowne Parsons and Robert Bowne Parsons, later took over running the nursery, and by 1898, Samuel Bowne Parsons's son George H. Parsons, had taken over as superintendent of Parsons Nurseries. Later that year, George was found in the lavatory by his father; he had died of heart failure. Parsons Nurseries closed in 1901. Creation The land was acquired for Kissena Park (then called Kissena Lake Park) between 1904 and 1914. The family of Samuel Bowne Parsons had sold off his nursery following his 1906 death. The nursery was located at the north end of the modern park at Parsons Boulevard and Rose Avenue. Real estate developers John W. Paris and Edward McDougal (or MacDougall) bought most of the Parsons land. This land was used to create the \\"Kissena Park\\" residential development. New York City bought the rest of the Parsons land and a few other land parcels to create Kissena Park. A tract of Parsons's exotic specimens was preserved and is now the Historic Grove. In 1907, Paris and McDougal were accused of graft and fraud after they attempted to sell of land back to the city at inflated prices, earning $140,000 as a result. A grand jury was convened to investigate the transaction. Joseph Bermel, the Queens borough president at the time, was later found to be involved in the deal, having allegedly received $12,000 from the transaction. In March 1908, the grand jury recommended that those involved be found guilty of graft. Later that month, Bermel was charged with perjury and bribery after he tried to hide his involvement in the scandal. He resigned his post as borough president in April 1908 and was subsequently scheduled to give testimony at a grand jury trial, but fled the United States the day before he was to testify. Bermel's lawyer and brother were also charged with perjury. The actual construction of the park involved draining and filling in the marshland that made up the majority of the park's area. Kissena Park opened in 1910, while the World War I memorial knoll on the south side of Kissena Lake was dedicated in 1921. Kissena Park was originally envisioned as the primary park of Queens, similar to Central Park in Manhattan and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. It contained landscaping, similar to both parks: the western end of Kissena Lake drained into the creek and was traversed by a bridge, similar to Central Park's Gapstow Bridge. The park also included a gazebo and a swimming pool with lake water, both of which were removed. Incorporation into Kissena Corridor Park Steward Railroad right-of-way at the northwest corner of Kissena Park Kissena Park is located on a 19th-century railroad right-of-way. A raised nature trail running through Kissena Park was originally the main line of the Central Railroad of Long Island of A.T. Stewart (later the White Line or Creedmore branch of the Long Island Rail Road. It ran from Flushing to Bellerose and was later extended from Bellerose to Garden City. In August 1940, the New York City Board of Estimate approved Queens Borough President George U. Harvey's request to acquire the former Stewart Railroad right-of-way from Flushing Meadows at Lawrence Street (College Point Boulevard) east to Fresh Meadow Road (now Utopia Parkway). The right-of-way was acquired into two tracts. The western tract west of Kissena Park and Kissena Boulevard extended with an average width of . The eastern segment also extended one mile past Kissena Park, with an average width of . The western stretch of the land west of Kissena Boulevard was to become the Kissena Corridor Park, which would connect Flushing Meadows and Kissena Parks. The eastern stretch of the land would be developed into a second corridor called the \\"Cunningham Corridor\\", which would connect Kissena Park with Cunningham Park further southeast. The corridors would include playgrounds, sports fields, park trails, and bicycle and bridle paths which would connect to existing paths in Cunningham Park. The Kissena Corridor project was also supposed to include the construction of a major storm sewer through the corridor, which the Parks Department said was necessitated as a result of \\"the great extent of this natural drainage basin.\\" In 1942, the federal War Production Board barred the construction of the Corridor Sewer, due to steel requirements for the World War II effort. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the sewer project were held on April 1, 1947, at the intersection of Lawrence Street and Fowler and Blossom Avenues, near the modern-day Queens Botanical Garden west of Kissena Park. On February 19, 1948, the final contract for the project, including the trunk line from 188th Street to Francis Lewis Boulevard, was authorized from the Board of Estimate. On February 27, the Queens borough sewer engineer announced that the cost of the sewer project would run to over $10 million, $2.25 million higher than the previous figure. The main trunk of the Corridor Sewer was completed by September 1948, although many of the feeder lines had yet to be constructed. At the end of the 1939‚Äì40 New York World's Fair in 1940, debris from the demolition of the fair exhibits was used to fill the section of the future Kissena Corridor west of Main Street (today's Queens Botanical Garden). By 1941, the New York City Department of Sanitation led by Commissioner William F. Carey began planning to fill the Kissena Corridor site between Main Street and Kissena Boulevard with municipal waste as a landfill. Afterward, the landfill would be excavated to install the sewer, and would act as a cover for the sewer. At the time, using garbage to fill the marshlands was considered more economical than filling it with clean dirt. In addition, the fill would help mitigate mosquitoes which inhabited the area around Kissena Creek. An existing landfill was already present on Rose Avenue in Kissena Park. This dump, which collected ashes, garbage, and refuse from Flushing, began operations in the 1930s. A second Kissena Park landfill on North Hempstead Turnpike (Booth Memorial Avenue) was opened on November 14, 1943 and closed in July 1945. Concurrently with the Kissena Corridor project, Kissena Lake was dredged in 1942 as part of a Works Progress Administration initiative. This transformed Kissena Lake into a \\"bathtub lake\\". Prior to the renovation, Kissena Lake was part of a wetland, which was believed to be a worthless type of land during the 20th century. A later renovation entailed categorization and major cleanup of the tree groves by Parks Department interns. In May 1951, Robert Moses announced plans to raise the grade the western stretch of Kissena Corridor Park between Flushing Meadows and 164th Street, including Kissena Park, by using it as a temporary garbage dump. Moses had already began filling the sites of other future parks with municipal waste, including Spring Creek Park and Marine Park in Brooklyn. The plans were opposed by Queens Borough President Maurice A. FitzGerald. On June 7, 1951, Moses eliminated plans for the dump, as well as an extension of 146th Street that had been planned along with the dump. The western stretch of the Kissena Corridor was eventually landfilled in the 1950s from dirt excavated for the construction of the Long Island Expressway. Renovations and additions The Stewart Railroad rail trail in Kissena Park The Kissena Velodrome, a velodrome, was constructed in the center of the park in 1962. It was used during the 1964 New York World's Fair and the U.S. team trials for the 1964 Summer Olympics. It is the only remaining bicycle track in New York City. By the 1980s. the park was being used as an illegal dumping ground. Algae buildup in Kissena Lake necessitated another restoration project, which was undertaken in 1983. Subsequently, a local naturalist named Charlie Emerson started planting a garden in 1986. The garden and an adjoining nature center were dedicated for Emerson in 1990. Meanwhile, the Velodrome had deteriorated over the years, and by 2000, efforts were underway to renovate the track. In 2003, a $2.3 million restoration drained the lake in stages, resulting in its current appearance. The city water was replaced with well water, an aeration system was installed the concrete bulkheads were replaced with natural-looking materials such as rocks and plants, and a small island for birds and turtles was built within the lake. The Kissena Velodrome was also restored, and the track was rededicated in 2004. In 2007, the Korean War memorial was unveiled at the park's northern entrance at Parsons Boulevard. The memorial, designed by William Crozier, commemorates Korean War veterans from Queens. Its centerpiece is a bronze sculpture called The Anguish of Experience, which depicts \\"a solitary soldier whose face portrays the agony of war\\", followed by five soldiers who carry a stretcher.

Launched on STS-117, he replaced Sunita Williams on June 10, 2007 as a member of the ISS Expedition 15 crew. He is currently an author, a motivational speaker, and a Professor of Practice at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Education Anderson graduated from Ashland-Greenwood High School, Ashland, Nebraska, 1977, received a bachelor of science degree (cum laude) in physics at Hastings College, Nebraska, in 1981 and a master of science degree in aerospace engineering at Iowa State University in 1983. NASA career=Astronaut duties Anderson watches as a water bubble floats in front of him on the shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission. Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1998, he reported for training in August of that year. Training included orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) systems, physiological training, ground school to prepare for T-38 flight training, as well as learning water and wilderness survival techniques. Prior to being assigned to a spaceflight, Anderson served as the lead for the Enhanced Caution and Warning (ECW) System development effort within the Space Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) Project. Previously, he was the Crew Support Astronaut for ISS Expedition 4, providing ground support on technical issues in addition to supporting the crew families. Anderson also served as an ISS Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) and as the Astronaut Office crew representative for the Station's electrical power system. In November 2002, Anderson completed training in the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Skills program. He was back-up flight engineer for Expedition 12, Expedition 13 and Expedition 14 to the International Space Station. Anderson served as an astronaut family escort for the STS-107 mission at the request of Rick Husband. In June 2003, Anderson served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 5 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for fourteen days. During a NEEMO 5 underwater EVA, Anderson cut his thumb with a knife. The wound was stitched up by hand surgeon and extreme medicine specialist Kenneth Kamler, who was observing the NEEMO project and dove to Aquarius to perform the procedure. He was a Mission Specialist on STS-131, launched in April 2010. The primary payload of this mission was a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module loaded with supplies and equipment for the International Space Station. =International Space Station= Destiny module of the International Space Station. Anderson was a member of the Expedition 15 crew and spent 152 days on board the International Space Station. He launched to the station aboard Shuttle Atlantis as Mission Specialist 5 for the STS-117 mission on June 8, 2007, and remained on board as a member of the Expedition 16 crew before returning to earth aboard Discovery on mission STS-120 on November 7, 2007. On return his official title was Mission Specialist 5. Two of the photos that he took during his July and August 2007 spacewalks were listed on Popular Science's photo gallery of the best astronaut selfies. Anderson continued a tradition aboard the International Space Station, started by Michael Lopez-Alegria, of conducting daily \\"trivia\\" contests with mission control team members on the ground. During Alegria's seven-month stay on the station he would routinely call down movie quotes and challenge the team members to determine the movie the quote was from. Towards the end of his mission, he changed to music trivia playing a portion of a song and challenging the team to complete the line. Anderson has taken this tradition and put his own personal twist on it, using the \\"Book of Answers: The New York Public Library Telephone Reference Service's Most Unusual and Entertaining Questions\\". Anderson often played song clips for the ground control team, or specific individuals, most notably when he played the song \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\\" by Bryan Adams for his wife on her birthday. Personal Anderson was born in Omaha but considers Ashland, Nebraska to be his hometown. Married to Susan Jane Anderson (n√©e Harreld) of Elkhart, Indiana. They have two children; a son, Clayton \\"Cole\\" and a daughter, Sutton Marie. His mother, Alice J. Anderson, died in December 2007, shortly after his return to earth. His father, John T. Anderson, is deceased. Like many of the other astronauts and cosmonauts, he is a licensed amateur radio operator having passed the technician class license exam in 2001 and was issued the call sign KD5PLA by the Federal Communications Commission on August 13, 2001.KD5PLA During his stay on the ISS in September 2007, he used one of the two amateur radio stations on board to talk with school children.for information on ARISS ‚Äì Amateur Radio on the International Space Station.

Biography Born in Den Helder, Ket spent his childhood in Hoorn and then Ede before attending the Kunstoefening in Arnhem from 1922 to 1925. Born with a serious heart defect (believed to be tetralogy of Fallot with dextrocardia),\\"Genetic Disorders in Portraits\\" @ PubMedLock, Last, & Dunea 2001, p. 66. he was prevented from traveling by debilitating weakness as well as by phobias, and lived secluded in his parents' house in Bennekom after 1930. Exposed to modern art mainly through reproductions, he concentrated on painting still lifes and self-portraits. His health worsened in his last decade, leading to his early death in Bennekom in 1940. Works While Ket's earliest paintings are impressionistic in style, he was influenced decisively by the art of the Neue Sachlichkeit in 1929, and thereafter painted in a magic realist style. His meticulously composed and rendered still lifes feature favorite objects such as bottles, an empty bowl, eggs, and musical instruments. Ket juxtaposed these objects in angular arrangements, seen from a high vantage point, their cast shadows creating emphatic diagonals. These compositions reveal the influence of cubism as filtered through the posters of Cassandre, which are frequently depicted in Ket‚Äôs paintings. Another source of inspiration came from early Netherlandish painting, which Ket admired for its atmosphere of austere reverence that he called its quality of \\"intrusiveness\\".Grove Art Online: Dick Ket Ket completed approximately 140 paintings, including forty self-portraits. As a result of his technical experimentation with different formulations and additives to the glaze medium, some of his paintings are not completely dry after six decades. In his self- portraits the progressive symptoms of his physical deterioration, such as cyanosis and finger clubbing, are apparent. Museums holding works by Dick Ket include the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Museum Arnhem, and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. ReferencesFurther reading *Lock, S., Last, J.

For the American rock band of that name, see Polski Fiat (band). Polski Fiat (literally in English: the Polish Fiat) was a Polish car brand. Under this brand, cars under licence of the Italian manufacturer FIAT were manufactured or assembled in Poland. Before World War II The brand was created in 1932, when the Polish government made an agreement with FIAT to produce licence cars in a state factory PZIn≈º. (Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady In≈ºynieryjne) in Warsaw. The cars were sold and serviced by the newly created Polish-Italian company Polski Fiat SA. First cars were assembled from Italian parts (a compact car PF 508/I), other later models were also assembled from parts, such as the small car Fiat Topolino. From the mid-1930s, the factory started to produce whole cars. The main produced models were (PF stands for Polski Fiat): *PF 508/III Junak - a compact car *PF 518 Mazur - a mid-size car *PF 618 Grom - 1.5 t truck *PF 621L - 2.5 t truck, also in a bus variant PF 621R Special military models, developed in Poland: *PF 508/IIIW ≈Åazik - passenger off-road car *PF 518 ≈Åazik - passenger off-road car *PF 508/518 - utility off-road car and a light artillery tractor (based on parts of PF 508 and PF 518) The brand ceased to exist after the outbreak of World War II, when the factory was seized by the Germans in 1939. After World War II The brand Polski Fiat re-appeared in the 1960s, when the Polish government renewed connections with Fiat and bought a licence for a mid-size car Polski Fiat 125p. The deal was signed in 1965, and the first cars were assembled from parts by the factory, FSO, in 1967, their production started from 1968 and ended in 1991, however the brand Polski Fiat was replaced with FSO (which had already been seen on other models such as the 125p-based FSO Polonez) in 1983.

The magazine is the feature publication for the corporation. Related publications, web sites and a nonprofit organization are among the corporate projects. The magazine includes local, national and world news, an extensive opinion section, arts and entertainment, a bar guide and classifieds. The magazine moved in 2007 to new offices in the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City, and created a news-portal web site. History Longtime Utah gay activist Michael Aaron approached Steven Peterson in 2004 to publish what Aaron called a much-needed professional newspaper for Utah's LGBT community. Aaron had co-published the Community Reporter newspaper and Triangle Magazine in the 1980s and 90s. Peterson had published the Little Lavender Book business and organization directory. The first issue of Salt Lake Metro newspaper was published in 2004 by Metro Publishing Inc. with Aaron as publisher and Peterson as sales manager. The newspaper began publishing when an LGBT campaign against a proposed state constitutional amendment to prohibit same- sex marriage was developing. The focus on hard news and editorial content was intended to distinguish it from other local publications. Salt Lake Metro found quick success in attracting readers and web-site visitors, but the business partnership was wrought with disputes as advertising sales failed. Aaron was forced to scale back on writers, editors and syndicated content. By the end of 2005, Aaron was acting as publisher, editor and art director. In 2005, the newspaper created the \\"Metro Cares Foundation,\\" a nonprofit organization to support LGBT groups in the state. Aaron left Metro Publishing Inc. in 2006 after a failed attempt to purchase it. The remaining writers and office staff went with him and QSaltLake newspaper was published two weeks later by Salt Lick Publishing LLC. The newspaper featured local and national news, opinion--both serious and camp, arts and entertainment, and sports. Cover stories ranged from the use of methamphetamine in the LGBT community to an interview with entertainer RuPaul. The newspaper created its annual readers' choice Fabby Awards ceremony in 2005. Salt Lick Publishing LLC created Pride365, a series of annual events which celebrated LGBT pride throughout the year in Salt Lake City and which culminated in the Utah Pride Festival. Pride365 ended its activities in 2007 when its director, Chad Keller, died. As QSaltLake owner and publisher, Aaron won the 2011 Utah Pride Festival \\"Dr. Kristen Ries Community Service Award.\\" QSaltLake was redesigned as a magazine in 2012 when Salt Lick Publishing LLC. The corporation continued the management and publication of the magazine and its projects despite a financial-loan shortfall that year.

Features This game has quite a few new features. Some of the features are for graphical purposes (e.g. new weather effects), and others are purely for gameplay purposes (e.g. new tackle options and off-load passing options). Some of the features are listed below, with a brief explanation: Playable modes 6 Nations, Tri-Nations (with the Bledisloe Cup), Ten Nations, Lions Tour (SA, NZ, Australia), Super 14, Guinness Premiership, World League, World Championship, European Trophy, manager mode Increased tactical plays 25+ new tactical plays can be chosen. If the player chooses wisely, he can gain the upper hand. Off-load passing When the player draws a defender to him, he is able to quickly off-load the ball to a teammate, before the defender actually tackles him. This can cause a gap in the defensive line, which can be exploited by the player to the players advantage. Comprehensive commentary Ian Robertson returns for this game, next to former All Black great Grant Fox, as well as comments from Murray Mexted. Impact Players Impact/Star players, are players in the game that could potentially turn a match in the player's favour. These player are the best in-game in their specialised area.

Synopsis The story takes place at the time of the conquest of the Aztecs by Cortez. The Tlascalan Prince Xalca and Ramatzin, General of Montezuma's Army, vie for the hand of Montezuma's daughter Azora; the former having prevailed, Montezuma condemns the lovers to death. In a scene set at dawn in a cavern, all gather by the sacrificial stone, but before the execution can proceed Cortez and his priests appear, and the lovers are set free.  Roles  *A Spanish Priest *Azora, the Daughter of Montezuma (soprano) *Canek, High Priest of the Sun (bass) *Hernando Cortez, Conqueror of Mexico *Montezuma II, Emperor of Mexico (bass) *Ramatzin, General of Montezuma's Army (baritone) *Papantzin, Sister of Montezuma (contralto) *Piqui-Chaqui (Flea-footed), A Runner *Xalca, A Tlascalan Prince (tenor) Performance history The Chicago Opera Association gave the work its world premiere in Chicago, Illinois on December 26, 1917 and performed it once more in Chicago shortly thereafter. As a single performance during an out-of-town residency that opened with the New York premiere of Mascagni's Isabeau, the Chicago company gave Azora its New York premiere on January 26, 1918 at the Lexington Opera House. The composer conducted, and the cast included Anna Fitziu as Azora, Forrest Lamont as Xalca, Cyrena van Gordon as Papantzin, Arthur Middleton as Ramatzin, Frank Preisch as Canek, and James Goddard as Montezuma. Although all members of the cast were promoted as young American singers, Lamont, who admittedly first trained and would make most of his career in the United States, was actually of Canadian birth. There were further performances given the same season in Boston and St. Louis. The New York Times offered mostly praise for the \\"fresh, young, powerful voices\\" of the cast; only Goddard was \\"out of voice,\\" and even he received high marks for his dramatic presentation. The paper's assessment of the work itself, however, although on balance favorable, was not unmixed: \\"...[W]hile [the] opera lacks somewhat the routine of the theater, and still more the dramatic note, it nevertheless escapes being either mere scholar's music or unsingable.\\" The Times singled out for praise \\"a fine barbaric dance in the first act,\\" the heroine's aria \\"Now Fades the Opal Sky\\" in Act 2, and some ensembles but suggested that more than one segment of the score somewhat outstayed its welcome. The paper also faulted the work for setting the execution in a cave: \\"The opera should have ended in the open, for the Aztecs worshipped on plateaus, on the pyramid of Cholula, for example, and not in caves.\\" Nonetheless, it deemed the setting appropriately atmospheric for the drama's purposes. After the performance, both Hadley and Stevens appeared for curtain calls. Fitziu presented Hadley with a large silk American flag, and the \\"representative audience of New York musicians and society folk\\" joined in singing as the orchestra played The Star Spangled Banner.

The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1963. It was located in the Jostedalen valley in the northern part of the present-day municipality of Luster (in Vestland county), north of the village of Gaupne. The administrative centre was located near the Jostedal Church in the central part of the valley. Name The Old Norse form of the name was probably . The first element is then the genitive of Jastra (the old name of the river Josted√∏la) and the last element is dalr which means \\"valley\\" or \\"dale\\". The river name is probably derived from j«´str which means \\"yeast\\". The water in the river comes from glaciers, and in summer time the river gets \\"frothy\\" or \\"foamy\\" due to all of the melting ice and the many waterfalls. History Jostedal was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1963, Jostedal municipality (population: 796) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Luster (population: 2,674) and Hafslo (population: 2,384) which created a new, larger Luster Municipality. Geography The former municipality consisted of Jostedalen valley which empties into the Gaupnefjord at the village of Gaupne. The Gaupnefjord is an arm of the Lustrafjorden, which is an arm of the famous Sognefjord, the second largest fjord in the world. There are three major glacial lakes in the area: Tunsbergdalsvatn, Nigardsbrevatn, and Styggevatn (vatn is Norwegian for lake). Other lakes in Jostdedal include Austdalsvatnet and Styggevatnet. The river Josted√∏la runs through the valley up to its headwaters at the Jostedalsbreen glacier, a plateau glacier which is the European mainland's largest with an area of .

History of investigation There is no designated type locality for the group. It was named for exposures in the San Rafael Swell in Emery County, Utah by Gilluly and Reeside in 1928. That same year they divided the group into (ascending): Carmel Formation, Entrada Sandstone (new), Curtis Formation (new), and Summerville Formation (new). Areal extent limits were established by Gregory and Moore in 1931. Smith in 1954 revised and divided the group into Entrada, Todilto, and Thoreau (new) formations in the San Juan Basin. In 1959 another revision, this time by Griggs and Read, divided it into Entrada and Bell Ranch (new) formations in the Palo Duro Basin and Sierra Grande Uplift. The Carmel-Navajo contact was revised by Wright and others in 1962 and the Carmel-Entrada contact was revised by Phoenix in 1963. Thompson and Stokes created an overview and named the Henrieville Sandstone in 1970. The Temple Cap Sandstone was revised and the Page Sandstone added (new) by Peterson and Pipiringos in 1979. A revision by O'Sullivan in 1980 divided the group into Carmel, Entrada, and Wanakah formations in Paradox Basin. O'Sullivan revised the upper contact in 1984.

Books and investigations on the subject that have received general notice include works by the historian Alfred McCoy, professor and diplomat Peter Dale Scott, journalists Gary Webb and Alexander Cockburn, and writer Larry Collins. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial. The following is a summary of some of the main claims made by geographical area. Golden Triangle During the Korean War, the first allegations of CIA drug trafficking surfaced after 1949, stemming from a deal whereby arms were supplied to Chiang Kai-shek's defeated generals in exchange for intelligence. Later in the same region, while the CIA was sponsoring a \\"Secret War\\" in Laos from 1961 to 1975, it was openly accused of trafficking heroin in the Golden Triangle area. To fight its \\"Secret War\\" against the Pathet Lao communist movement of Laos, the CIA used the Miao/Meo (Hmong) population. Because of the war, the Hmong depended upon opium poppy cultivation for hard currency. The Plain of Jars had been captured by Pathet Lao fighters in 1964, which resulted in the Royal Lao Air Force being unable to land its C-47 transport aircraft on the Plain of Jars for opium transport. The Royal Laotian Air Force had almost no light planes that could land on the dirt runways near the mountaintop poppy fields. Having no way to transport their opium, the Hmong were faced with economic ruin. Air America, a CIA front organization, was the only airline available in northern Laos. Alfred McCoy writes, \\"According to several unproven sources, Air America began flying opium from mountain villages north and east of the Plain of Jars to CIA asset Hmong General Vang Pao's headquarters at Long Tieng.\\" The CIA's front company, Air America was alleged to have profited from transporting opium and heroin on behalf of Hmong leader Vang Pao, or of \\"turning a blind eye\\" to the Laotian military doing it. This allegation has been supported also by former Laos CIA paramilitary Anthony Poshepny (aka Tony Poe), former Air America pilots, and other people involved in the war. It is portrayed in the movie Air America. Larry Collins alleged: Further documentation of CIA-connected Laotian opium trade was provided by Rolling Stone magazine in 1968, and by Alfred McCoy in 1972.The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, by Alfred W. McCoy, with Cathleen B. Read and Leonard P. Adams II, 2003, p. 385 McCoy stated that: However, aviation historian William M. Leary, writes that Air America was not involved in the drug trade, citing Joseph Westermeyer, a physician and public health worker resident in Laos from 1965 to 1975, that \\"American-owned airlines never knowingly transported opium in or out of Laos, nor did their American pilots ever profit from its transport.\\" Aviation historian Curtis Peebles also denies that Air America employees were involved in opium transportation. CIA response In a 2006 CIA history of covert warfare in Laos, released in 2009 under an FOIA request, CIA historian Thomas Ahern writes that from the beginning of CIA's work organizing tribal military forces, troops were prohibited from carrying opium on U.S. chartered flights. Only large packages were inspected, so that small amounts of opium for local consumption might have been carried by individuals, but \\"the prohibition of commercial traffic was unequivocal\\". United States Several conspiracy theories assert that the CIA used Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport to smuggle weapons and ammunition to the Contras in Nicaragua, and drugs back into the United States. Some theories even invoke the involvement of political figures, including Oliver North and former presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. The CIA's self-investigation, overseen by the CIA's inspector general, stated that the CIA had no involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activities that may have occurred in Mena. The report said that the agency had conducted a training exercise at the airport in partnership with another Federal agency and that companies located at the airport had performed \\"routine aviation-related services on equipment owned by the CIA\\". The film American Made is a fictionalized telling of the story of Barry Seal, a pilot and Medell√≠n Cartel drug smuggler who based his operations in Mena. Mexico In October 2013, two former federal agents and an ex-CIA contractor told an American television network that CIA operatives were involved in the kidnapping and murder of DEA covert agent Enrique Camarena, because he was a threat to the agency's drug operations in Mexico. According to the three men, the CIA was collaborating with drug traffickers moving cocaine and marijuana to the United States, and using its share of the profits to finance Nicaraguan Contra rebels attempting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The CIA spokesman responding to the allegation called it \\"ridiculous\\" to suggest that the agency had anything to do with the murder of a US federal agent or the escape of his alleged killer. Honduras The Honduran drug lord Juan Matta-Ballesteros was the owner of SETCO, an airline which the Nicaraguan Contras used to covertly transport military supplies and personnel in the early 1980s. Writers such as Peter Dale Scott and Jonathan Marshall have suggested that the U.S. government's desire to conceal or protect these clandestine shipments led it to close the DEA office in Honduras when an investigation began into SETCO, allowing Matta-Ballesteros to continue and expand his trafficking. Nicaragua In 1986, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations began investigating drug trafficking from Central and South America and the Caribbean to the United States. The investigation was conducted by the Sub-Committee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations, chaired by Senator John Kerry, so its final 1989 report was known as the Kerry Committee report. The Report concluded that \\"it is clear that individuals who provided support for the Contras were involved in drug trafficking, the supply network of the Contras was used by drug trafficking organizations, and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers.\\" In 1996, Gary Webb wrote a series of articles published in the San Jose Mercury News, which investigated Nicaraguans linked to the CIA-backed Contras who had smuggled cocaine into the U.S. which was then distributed as crack cocaine into Los Angeles and funneled profits to the Contras. His articles asserted that the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large shipments of drugs into the U.S. by the Contra personnel and directly aided drug dealers to raise money for the Contras. The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and The Washington Post launched their own investigations and rejected Webb's allegations. In May 1997, The Mercury News executive editor Jerry Ceppos, who had approved the series, published a column that acknowledged shortcomings in the series reporting, editing, and production, while maintaining the story was correct \\"on many important points.\\" Webb later published a book based on the series, Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. The 2014 movie Kill the Messenger depicted actor Jeremy Renner as Gary Webb. Panama The U.S. invasion of Panama after which president Manuel Noriega was captured. In 1989, the United States invaded Panama as part of Operation Just Cause, which involved 25,000 American troops. General Manuel Noriega, head of Panama's government, had been giving military assistance to Contra groups in Nicaragua at the request of the U.S.‚Äîwhich, in exchange, allowed him to continue his drug-trafficking activities‚Äîwhich they had known about since the 1960s. When the DEA tried to indict Noriega in 1971, the CIA prevented them from doing so. The CIA, which was then directed by future president George H. W. Bush, provided Noriega with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year as payment for his work in Latin America. However, when CIA pilot Eugene Hasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua by the Sandinistas, documents aboard the plane revealed many of the CIA's activities in Latin America, and the CIA's connections with Noriega became a public relations \\"liability\\" for the U.S. government, which finally allowed the DEA to indict him for drug trafficking, after decades of allowing his drug operations to proceed unchecked. Operation Just Cause, whose ostensible purpose was to capture Noriega, pushed the former Panamanian leader into the Papal Nuncio where he surrendered to U.S. authorities. His trial took place in Miami, where he was sentenced to 45 years in prison. Venezuela A failed CIA anti-drug operation in Venezuela resulted in at least a ton of cocaine being smuggled into the United States and sold on the streets. The incident, which was first made public in 1993, was part of a plan to assist an undercover agent to gain the confidence of a Colombian drug cartel. The plan involved the unsupervised shipment of hundreds of pounds of cocaine from Venezuela. The drug in the shipments was provided by the Venezuelan anti-drug unit which was working with the CIA, using cocaine seized in Venezuela. The shipments took place despite the objections of the U.S. DEA. When the failed plan came to light, the CIA officer in charge of the operation resigned, and his supervisor was transferred. In addition, the former Venezuelan anti-narcotics chief General Ramon Guillen Davila and his chief civilian aide were both indicted in connection with the shipments. Because Venezuela does not extradite its citizens, Guillen was not tried in the U.S., but his civilian aide was arrested while in the United States and sentenced to 20 years.

He is known as the founder of The Jargon Society, which has published poetry, experimental fiction, photography, and folk art since 1951. Overview Williams was born in Asheville, North Carolina to Thomas Benjamin and Georgette Williams, and raised in Washington, DC. He attended St. Albans School in Washington, and then Princeton University,The Poetry Foundation before dropping out to pursue the arts. Williams studied painting with Karl Knaths at the Phillips Gallery in Washington DC, and engraving and graphic arts with Stanley William Hayter at Atelier 17 in New York, followed by a semester at the Chicago Institute of Design. In 1951, he arrived at Black Mountain College to study photography with Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind. At Black Mountain College, Williams met and was influenced by the College's rector, Charles Olson. Also in 1951, Williams founded Jargon Books (later The Jargon Society) together with David Ruff, with the goal of publishing obscure writers. Based in Scaly Mountain, North Carolina, as well as the Yorkshire Dales in England, Jargon was long associated with the Black Mountain Poets. The press has published work by Charles Olson, Paul Metcalf, Lorine Niedecker, Lou Harrison, Mina Loy, Joel Oppenheimer, Ronald Johnson, James Broughton, Alfred Starr Hamilton and many other works by the American and British avant-garde. Since Williams' death, The Jargon Society has continued publication through the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center.

In 2003, he wrote Journalistic Fraud: How The New York Times Distorts the News and Why It Can No Longer Be Trusted, a book with a thesis similar to that of Bernard Goldberg's Bias. Kohn's book describes a climate of liberal bias in which reporters routinely slant or spike news stories to ensure that the media presents a liberal point of view. Journalistic Fraud specifically speaks of The New York Times' news pages, as opposed to its opinion pages or media in general, which are not the concern of the book. Kohn cites copious examples of what he claims to be journalistically poor leading sentences and biased topic choice and placement in the news articles of the paper. He states that the news articles are (or were at the time) biased, and political opinion in newspapers should be confined to the editorials. On September 4, 2012, Kohn submitted an amicus brief in US v. Apple opposing the Department of Justice's settlement and theory of the ebook price fixing case in a 5-page comic strip.

He was the first Head of State who had the title of President of the Republic. He wanted to finish the Peruvian independence process only by Peruvians' own efforts organized by the Segunda Campa√±a de Intermedios, but failed. His disagreements with Congress and Bolivar's Arrival determined en end of his mandate and his deportation, first to Guayaquil and then to Europe, where he lived until he came back to America in 1828. He went first to Chile and then returned to Peru in 1833 and was elected deputy to a Convention that reincorporated him in the army with the title of Grand Marshal. Supporter of President Luis Jos√© de Orbegoso, he was plenipotentiary minister in Chile and President of the Nor Peruvian State in the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. After the end of that political entity, he went again to Ecuador in 1843.  Early life and political career  Riva Ag√ºero was son of Jos√© De la Riva Ag√ºero y Basso della Rovere, a Spanish aristocrat of Italian origin, member of the Della Rovere family, and the criolla Mar√≠a Josefa S√°nchez Boquete Rom√°n de Aulestia Marquess De Montealegre de Aulestia, and married the Belgian princess Caroline Arnoldine de Looz -Corswarem. He inherited from his mother's family the title of Marquess of Montealegre de Aulestia and was baptized in the parish of San Marcelo of Lima in 1784. He spent his childhood and youth in Spain, where he was educated and later participated in the wars against the Napoleonic invasion. He moved to France for a time and then, when he was back in Madrid, was awarded with La Orden of Carlos III (1807). Moved by the nationalist ardor caused by the Napoleonic invasion in 1808, he enlisted in the Spanish army and participated in some early actions against the French in Guip√∫zcoa, Burgos and C√≥rdoba. During his brief military experience, he was awarded and recognized by the Spanish Royal Crown because of the courage showed in a campaign where he saved the lives of 10 comrades after the mission's General was shot to death. In 1809, he returned to Lima and participated in the independence cause. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n named him prefect of Lima in 1822. Upon the departure of San Mart√≠n and the ensuing social instability in the country, Andr√©s de Santa Cruz revolted against the Peruvian Congress on February 26, 1823 and forced it to elect Riva Ag√ºero as President. Riva Ag√ºero proclaimed himself \\"President of Peru\\", the first to use such title. During his short government, he suffered the entry of Spanish troops into the capital and the departure of the government towards a new installation at the port of Callao. Under this situation, Riva Ag√ºero lost all support of the Peruvian Congress, which awaited anxiously the arrival of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. He was later deposed by Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Sucre was succeeded by Jos√© Bernardo de Torre Tagle until the arrival of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Congress had been waiting for the Venezuelan \\"Liberator\\" to come to Peru and help to consolidate the Independence of the country, and was more than willing to grant him all necessary powers. Fearing the loss of leadership, Riva Ag√ºero sought to conciliate with the Viceroy to prevent the arrival of Bol√≠var, only to be arrested and accused of high treason. He was subsequently exiled to Chile. There he wrote the Memorias y documentos para la Historia de la Independencia del Per√∫ y causas del mal √©xito que ha tenido √©sta (Memories and documents for the history of the independence of Peru and causes for its failure so far), one of the most important sources for the period. During the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation Riva Ag√ºero supported Mariscal Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, and became president of the Republic of North Peru in 1838. After its collapse, he retired from public life until his death in 1858. He had five children with Caroline-Arnoldine de Looz-Corswarem. His eldest son was Jos√© de la Riva-Ag√ºero y Looz-Corswarem.  Conspiracy in Lima  Cover page of Manifestaci√≥n hist√≥rica y pol√≠tica de la revoluci√≥n de Am√©rica. During his time in Spain, he joined an American lodge that worked for the independence of America. He came back to Peru after he was appointed as accountant and conservative judge in the area of luck and lotteries in the Tribunal Mayor de Cuentas de Lima (1810), returned to Peru, via Buenos Aires, decided to support the independence movement. During his trip, he avoided harassment from the authorities: he was briefly arrested in Montevideo but; in Buenos Aires, he had to flee furtively after realizing that they were going to return him to Spain. Something similar happened in the city of Mendoza. Already established in Lima, he was associated with various groups of patriots and maintained active correspondence with those of Chile and Buenos Aires, which had already been installed Governing Boards. He ran Lima's Lodge from home, located at Santa Teresa (now fifth block of Jir√≥n Puno) or the house of the Count of Vega del Ren, in the street of Botica San Pedro (now fourth block of Jir√≥n Mir√≥ Quesada). He was involved in almost all Lima conspiracies, which were closely monitored by the authorities and eventually persecuted. However, the intervention of powerful friends and relatives saved him. In 1816 he wrote a Manifestaci√≥n hist√≥rica y pol√≠tica de la revoluci√≥n de Am√©rica, published anonymously in Buenos Aires in 1818 in which he exposed 20 causes justifying the insurgency against the colonial regime.  Contact with San Mart√≠n  Riva Ag√ºero was then in intensive contacts with Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who after securing the independence of Chile planned to go to Peru. He sent valuable data on the situation of the royalist forces and helped define the plan of operations of the Army of the Andes to attack the central coast of Peru to penetrate the Alto Peru. For all these reasons, the figure of Riva Ag√ºero was instrumental in achieving the emancipation of Spanish America. At that time, a messenger of San Martin was captured with correspondence that was addressed to Riva Ag√ºero and other Lima patriots in April 1819. The Viceroy Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela then ordered the confinement of Riva Ag√ºero in Tarma (central highlands of Peru) while preparing a boat to take him to Spain, but the legal appeal and the disruption caused by the arrival of San Martin during his Freedom Expedition led such a severe measure to be abandoned. Even in such conflict, Riva Ag√ºero continued laboring for the cause of independence, convincing many officers to desert the royal troops. Indeed, he was one of those who influenced over Numancia Battalion's celebrated change to the patriot ranks. Similarly, he promoted the guerrilla organization to sever accesses in Lima. He also helped to produce the schism and disagreement among the Spanish generals themselves and help to infiltrate the royal army with double agents.

There have been very few cases in which the defence of necessity has succeeded, and in general terms there are very few situations where such a defence could even be applicable. The defining feature of such a defence is that the situation is not caused by another person (which would fall under either duress or self-defence) and that the accused was in genuine risk of immediate harm or danger. For the most part crimes that could be justified as necessary are minor in nature, such as driving over the speed limit to reach medical care, or damaging property to escape a fire. In almost all cases where a serious crime has taken place, necessity is unlikely to be a successful defence as courts have mostly taken the view that directly harming another person could not be justified even by extreme circumstances unless it directly prevented immediate serious harm or death. Even if a person were already likely to die, and their death would allow others to survive, killing them is not necessary until the point where harm is imminently likely to occur to the others and if that harm is not immediate, then necessity cannot apply. As such the circumstances where necessity could apply to a serious crime are extremely narrow, involving two or more people in an immediately life- threatening situation where only one could survive. Even in this situation, as the law does allow for a person not to take actions that would save another person if to do so would put their own life at risk, it is seldom strictly necessary for one person to kill another, one allowing the other to die in the course of the situation, then saving themselves. The Crown Prosecution Service has historically chosen to exercise its discretion not to prosecute those cases where it believes potential defendants have acted reasonably in all the circumstances, and as such where necessity is a strong defence. History This defence was used in the early trial of Regina v. Dudley & Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273 DC, where four shipwrecked sailors were cast adrift in a small boat without provisions. To save themselves, the three strongest decided to eat the fourth, the 17-year-old cabin boy. The court ruled that cannibalising the boy was not urgently necessary. Even though the cabin boy would almost certainly have died of natural causes, the sailors killed the boy intentionally and were guilty of murder. There was some degree of necessity arising from the threat of starvation but, at any moment, a ship could have sailed over the horizon to save them as, indeed, the three were rescued. Since they could never be sure that the killing was actually necessary from one minute to the next, the defence was denied. Cannibalism itself is not an offence so long as the death occurs naturally. Dudley and Stephens were convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged; however, their sentence was later reduced to just six months in prison. The third man, Brooks, was not tried, as he had not participated in the murder. The principles from this case form the basis of the defence of necessity not being available for murder. The principles There must be an urgent and immediate threat to life which creates a situation in which the defendant reasonably believes that a proportionate response to that threat is to break the law. This reflects the distinction between the defences of necessity and duress in that the former is pressure of circumstances arising naturally, whereas the latter is a threat from an entirely human agency that overpowers the will of the defendant. The general approach was laid down by Lord Denning in Southwark London Borough Council v Williams (1971) 2 AER 175 that necessity should be denied as a general defence because otherwise anarchy and disorder would follow. If hunger was allowed to become the basis of necessity, any poor person might seek to justify burglary to steal food by arguing that he or she had reasonably believed that this was a proportionate response to the threat of malnutrition. Thus, the fact that hunger does not arise spontaneously, and there are other ways in which to seek relief from poverty (e.g. work or by seeking welfare support or charity), would deny the defence of necessity. The Canadian courts put the issue succinctly. In Perka v The Queen (1984) 2 SCR 232, Dickson J. held at p250 that :If the defence of necessity is to form a valid and consistent part of our criminal law it must, as has been universally recognised, be strictly controlled and scrupulously limited to situations that correspond to its underlying rationale. When considering necessity in R v Cole (1994) Crim. LR 582 Simon Brown LJ. held that the peril relied on to support the plea of necessity lacked imminence and the degree of directness and immediacy required of the link between the suggested peril and the offence charged. This defendant robbed two building societies in order to repay debts. The form of defence was \\"duress by circumstance\\" which attempts to extend the coverage of duress by borrowing the idea of an uncontrollable external circumstance forcing a choice by the defendant to break the law. Medical necessity In Quayle and Others v R; Attorney General's Reference (No. 2 of 2004) (2005) EWCA Crim 1415 each defendant appealed convictions associated variously with the cultivation or possession of cannabis resin to be used for pain management. The choice facing the appellants was not severe pain without cannabis or absence of pain with cannabis, rather it was the absence of pain with adverse side effects without cannabis, and absence of pain with minimal side effects with cannabis. The difference was restricted to the adverse side effects which, however unpleasant, could not sensibly be said to raise a prima facie possibility of serious injury, let alone one such as would overwhelm the will of the defendant. There was no evidence from an objective standpoint that the appellants were acting reasonably and proportionately to a threat of injury. The evidence was clear that it was possible for the appellants to control pain by conventional and legal means. To admit the medical use of cannabis on the ground of necessity would defeat the legislative purpose underpinning the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Further, for the defence of necessity to succeed, the threat of injury must be immediate and imminent and come from an extraneous source. The parties were responding to continuous pain over a period of time and, in any event, pain is too subjective to qualify as an external threat. There was nothing urgent that overwhelmed their will to resist. The parties then argued that the law breached Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with the right of privacy. Interference with the right of respect for private life is permissible under Article 8(2) if \\"in accordance with the law and ... necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". Within the limits indicated in Taylor (Joseph) v Lancashire County Council (2005) EWCA Civ 284, the court's decision would involve an evaluation of the medical and scientific evidence, but their conclusion was that this was a policy matter more properly within the remit of the relevant Minister. Thus, this unlawful self-help did not qualify as necessity and did not fall within the protection of Article 8 ECHR. In Altham (2006) EWCA Crim 7 the defendant used cannabis for pain relief following injury in a road accident. He was charged with possession under s5(2) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The judge at first instance refused to leave the defence of medical necessity to the jury so the defendant changed his plea to guilty. The Court of Appeal held that Article 3 ECHR (not to subject a person to inhuman or degrading treatment) does apply to the state. The defendant argued that using cannabis was the only way in which his symptoms could be alleviated and that he could not do so without committing a criminal offence. Thus, the state, by prosecuting him, subjected him to degrading treatment. The court said that the state, by refusing cannabis, neither did nor refrained from doing anything that would subject the defendant to degrading treatment. The state had done nothing to change the defendant's condition for better or worse, and there was nothing to require the court to read the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as subject to a defence of medical necessity. The court applied Quayle where the focus was on Article 8, and the defence of necessity was denied because it would be in conflict with the purpose and effect of the legislative scheme. In Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) (2000) 4 AER 961 Jodie and Mary were ischiopagus conjoined twins (i.e. joined at the pelvis) and the Court of Appeal had to decide whether it was lawful to perform surgery to separate them when the separation would kill Mary. If the operation did not take place there was evidence that both would die within six months. The court proceeded on the basis that the potential charge would be murder in that, although the girls were physically joined, they were separate \\"lives in being\\". The court decided that the operation would be lawful. Ward LJ concluded that, by analogy with self-defence, it was lawful to kill Mary because she was, albeit lawfully, killing Jodie. Ward reasoned that causing Mary's death did not breach the public policy of \\"sanctity of life\\" because of the \\"quasi self-defence\\", but Brooke LJ, rejected self-defence because Mary was not unlawfully threatening Jodie's life. He concluded that necessity rather than duress of circumstances would apply because the doctor's will was not being overwhelmed by the threat. Instead, the doctors were making a rational choice to adopt the lesser of two evils, i.e. the death of one rather than the death of both twins. Ward LJ. reasoned that separation surgery was clearly in Jodie's best interests, but not in Mary's best interests because it denied her \\"inherent right to life.\\" Given the conflict of the children's interests and the consequent conflict in the doctor's duties to each child, there was \\"no other way of dealing with it than by choosing the lesser of the two evils and so finding the least detrimental alternative.\\" Jodie could benefit from the surgery to enjoy probably a near-normal life; refusal to allow separation would result in the death of both twins. So \\"the least detrimental alternative\\" was to allow separation. Necessity would not usually be allowed as a defence to murder, but Brooke LJ. distinguished Dudley & Stephens on the basis that the doctors were not selecting the victim unlike the cabin boy in Dudley. The decision is restricted to cases of medical necessity and a conflict of duty owed both by doctors to different patients and by parents to their children but does provide an interesting expansion of the law albeit, as Michalowski (2001) comments, it poses difficult questions as to who should take such decisions on behalf of patients.

DPR for Baramulla to Kupwara Railway Line is submitted again in July 2020 by Railway Board. Timeline First train to Jammu from Sialkot, 1897 *1897: The Jammu‚ÄìSialkot railway line is built from Sialkot to Jammu, the first rail line in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. *1902: Britain proposes a rail link following the Jhelum River, connecting Srinagar to Rawalpindi. The proposal is politically unpopular in the Maharaja's court, since most of the state's population centers are strung along the more-southerly Moghul road connecting Jammu and Srinagar. *1905: Britain again proposes a link between Rawalpindi and Srinagar. Maharaja Pratap Singh approves a rail line between Jammu and Srinagar via Reasi and the Moghul road. The line would have had or -gauge rail, climbing to the Moghul road pass at over the Pir Panjal Range (compare the present-day Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel's average elevation of ). The electric line would have used mountain streams as a source of hydro- electric power. The narrow gauge and high-altitude pass would have made the line weather-dependent and restricted its speed and capacity, similar to the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. However, this line was never built. *1947: With the partition of India, the Jammu-Sialkot line is closed since Sialkot is now in Pakistan. Jammu (and thereby the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir) is disconnected from the Indian rail network, and Pathankot is the nearest railhead. A new line from Pathankot to Jammu is obviously needed, but no work on such a line is initiated for the next twenty-four years. *1971: The foundation stone is laid and construction commences for a railway line linking Jammu to Pathankot and thereby to the Indian rail network. The imminent Indo- Pakistani War of 1971 may have given an impetus to this long-neglected project. *1975: The rail link between Jammu and Pathankot is established and the renovated Jammu Tawi railway station is opened. It will remain the northern end of the line (and the Indian Rail Network) for the next thirty years. *1983: Construction of a railway line from Jammu Tawi to Udhampur (northward of Jammu) begins, with an optimistic schedule of five years and a budget of . In fact, it will take 21 years and cost to build the 53 km line through mountainous terrain. A proposed extension to Srinagar is dismissed as economically unfeasible after a cursory, preliminary survey of the Pir Panjal Range. *1994: The railway minister declares the need for a rail line to Baramulla, well beyond even Srinagar, and it is learned that the proposed line will begin from Qazigund and run to Srinagar and then onwards to Baramulla. This means that there will be two disconnected stretches of track within the state, and that the proposed new line, which will service only the Kashmir valley, will not connect to the national network. The reason for this is that laying a railway line from either Katra or Udhampur to Qazigund through the mountains still appears unattainable. *2002: Little progress has been achieved since 1994 on the proposed \\"Valley\\" line (later known as \\"Leg 3\\"), mainly due to militancy and unrest. The Government of India declares the railway line a national project, funded entirely by the central government. It also states that an unbroken rail link is imperative, and that they will spend whatever money is required and provide all required environmental or other clearances to establish a rail link from Katra to Qazigund, and onwards through Srinagar to Baramulla. The estimated cost is now . *2005: The 53 km long Jammu-Udhampur section finally opens, 21 years and after its beginning, the line's Leg 0. The line, which cuts through the Shivalik Hills, has 20 major tunnels and 158 bridges. Its longest tunnel is 2.5 km in length and its highest bridge is (India's highest railway bridge). *2008: The Ministry of Railways cancels the project on the existing alignment between Katra and Qazigund due to suspected geological instability, ordering Konkan Railway (which had been tasked with the project) to stop all work on the section (including the Chenab Bridge) and terminate all contracts issued for work on the section before major route changes. The Railway Board appoints a committee to examine the feasibility of the project's Leg 2 and rework the Pir Panjal Range route, proposing a fresh survey for a shorter line. *2008: The 66 km section between Anantnag and Manzhama (Mazhom near Pattan, outside Srinagar) opens on 11 October 2008, with twice-daily service in both directions. Complications continue to affect the project for connection with the plain. *2009: On 14 February 2009, Leg 3 service is extended beyond Mazhom/Pattan to Baramulla. An extension of the track from Baramulla to Kupwara had been proposed, and its survey was completed in 2009, but the proposal is kept in abeyance for the time being. On 29 October the same year (2009), the 18 km-long section from Anantnag to Qazigund is inaugurated by the prime minister, marking the completion of Leg 3. This means that the entire \\"Valley\\" portion of the line, from Qazigund to Baramulla, as proposed in 1994, is now operational, but it remains disconnected from the national railway network. Meanwhile, in June 2009, work on the section between Katra and Qazigund had resumed after the committee approved the existing alignment with only minor changes. Additional geotechnical tests of rock strata and changes to other portions of the alignment would be reviewed. *2010: In December, Indian Railways completes a crucial tunnel in Sangaldam on the route between Katra and Banihal (on the Katra-Banihal-Qazigund section). *2011‚Äì12: Boring of the 11.215 km (7-mile) long Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel, known informally as the Banihal-Qazigund tunnel, is completed in October 2011. This was a crucial and extremely challenging project and its completion is hailed as an achievement. Tracks are laid during the following year, and a trial run begins on 28 December 2012. This means the line northward from Banihal (to Qazigund and on to Baramulla) is ready, but not the southward stretch towards the rest of India. Eight years after the contract to design and build the world's tallest rail bridge was awarded to Afcons Infrastructure Limited, excavation of the foundations of the bridge across the Chenab River begins.http://pugodesk.winwinhosting.net/dailyexcelsior/excavation-for- foundation-of-worlds-tallest-rly-bridge-begins/ The construction of all tunnels between Udhampur and Katra, including the T1 Tunnel which had seepage problem, was completed. *2013: The Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel and Banihal station are opened. On 9 December, a trial train reaches Katra from the Udhampur side. *2014: On 11 June, a trial train from Delhi arrives in anticipation of the opening of the Udhampur-Katra line, which will connect Katra to the rest of the country. On 4 July, the Udhampur-Katra line is opened and the Katra railway station is inaugurated. Commercial railway services now exist from the rest of India up to Katra, and also from Banihal all the way north to Baramulla, but the stretch from Katra to Banihal, an extremely challenging stretch, as described below, remains unfinished. *2018: On 08 November 2018, the Central Government approves extension of railway line from Baramulla to Kupwara. It may be recollected that the project had been proposed in the mid-2000s and a survey had been carried out in 2009. *2019: Status as of July 2019 is as follows. All portions of the track are ready except for the link between Katra and Banihal. This stretch of track is no more than 111 km long, but as much as 97.34 km of this is made up of tunnels. There are also to be 27 major bridges and 10 minor bridges. Among these bridges will be one built across the deep gorge of the Chenab river near the Salal hydro-electric dam. This bridge of steel arches, 1315 metres long, will stand at a height of 359 metres from the ground, which is 35 metres more than the height of the Eiffel tower. The project, which also encompasses 203 km of access roads, is expected to be ready by 2021. Progress The railway line is divided into four sections: * Leg 0, running 53 km from Jammu to Udhampur and completed in April 2005. * Leg 1, running 25 km from Udhampur to Katra. The section was dedicated on 4 July 2014. * Leg 2, running 111 km from Katra to Banihal. Under construction, expected to open in 2022.Total tunnels 35 ie 27 main 8 escape. 18 main tunnels and 2 escape tunnels are completed. Out of 37 bridges 20 are completed. * Leg 3 running 135 km from Banihal to Baramulla. The section was dedicated on 26th June 2013. Leg 0 Jammu Tawi railway station Leg 0 has been operational since 2005. Leg 1 Leg 1 has been operational since July 2014. The leg had missed opening dates in the past, including December 2005, December 2006 and May 2009. Work on the section, suspended for two years due to a partial tunnel collapse, resumed in September 2009. Although the section was planned to open by 2 February 2014, passenger service was delayed due to Commission of Railway Safety concerns about one bridge and tunnel. The route includes seven tunnels and 30 bridges. The section was opened on 4 July 2014. Leg 2 Leg 2, running 111 km from Katra to Banihal is under construction, may be completed in 2022. Construction on the leg has been beset by technical difficulties with alignment and disputes with contractors, and was originally expected to be finished in 2017‚Äì18. This is the line's most difficult section of the rail line, with 62 bridges and a number of tunnels totalling 10 km out of total 129 km. It requires 262 km of access roads connecting 147,000 people in 73 villages; 160 km, connecting 29 villages, is completed. In July 2008, work on part of the Katra-Banihal section was suspended for a possible realignment. The alternative alignment, proposed by the railway, reduced the track length from 126 km to 67 km. A committee appointed by the Railway Board recommended abandoning 93 km of the previously-approved alignment. On 12 November 2014, the Delhi High Court directed the central government to appoint a committee to review the 126 km-long section. An 18 km stretch of Leg 2, between Quazigund and Banihal, was authorised on 26 June 2013. The stretch includes the 11.215-km (7-mile) Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel, also known as the Banihal railway tunnel. India's longest rail tunnel, it is 8.4 m wide and 7.39 m high. The tunnel includes a 3 m-wide service road for maintenance and emergency use. Its average elevation, 1760 m, is 440 m below the existing road tunnel. The tunnel facilitates transportation during winter (when inclement weather closes the Srinagar-Jammu highway), and halves the distance between Quazigund and Banihal (35 km by road and 17.5 km by train). The Banihal railway station is 1,702 m (5,584 ft) above mean sea level, and trains run from Banihal to Qazigund through the tunnel. The 5 km Banganga section was expected to be operational before the completion date of 2017‚Äì18 for the entire project. This leg contains the construction of two extremely challenging bridges, an arch bridge on the Chenab river and cable-stayed Anji Khad Bridge. =Status updates= Status update of under construction 148 km route from Katra to Banihal. * Oct 2018: work on Chenab Bridge have stopped due to difference of opinion between contractor and railway staff.https://thewire.in/government/construction-iconic-chenab-rail-bridge- stops-contractual-issues-kashmir-rail-link-project-delayed * Dec 2018: Rail line described as likely to miss 2020 deadline.https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/kashmir/kashmir-railway-project- likely-to-miss-2020-deadline-too/305216.html * Aug 2019: New target period for completion is 2021‚Äì22.https://www.business-standard.com/article/current- affairs/railway-project-to-link-kashmir-with-rest-of-india-put-on-fast- track-119081901302_1.html * July 2020: The Railways have completed the construction of over 20 out of 37 small and large bridges. The Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal announced that the construction of this leg will be completed by August 2022. Leg 3 Banihal railway station Leg 3 has been operational since October 2009. The line from Baramulla to Banihal, across the Pir Panjal Range, is 130 km long. Since the 25 km-long Udhampur-Katra section was commissioned in October 2013, only the 148 km Katra-Banihal section of Leg 2 remains to be constructed. Until the Katra-Laole section of railway is finished by 2020, travel from Jammu Tawi (or Udhampur) to Banihal by road and from Banihal to Srinagar by rail is possible. Banihal - Baramulla section railway tracks is also being electrified, tracks electrification works is in full swing since July 2020. In June 2017 Ministry of Railways also laid the foundation stone of five new halt railway stations on Banihal - Baramulla section i. e. Sangdan , Ratnipora, Razwan , Monghall and Nadigam but civil works of these halt railway stations is yet start. https://t.co/mRYKyL33XZ =Extension= * Nov 2018: Central Government have approved extension of the railway line upto Kupwara.https://www.hindustantimes.com/india- news/credit-war-in-kashmir-after-centre-approves-railway-link/story- jcraISRn4F9xvbd16SQy6M.html On 22 August 2020 , Railway Officials told in meeting with Lt. Governor of J & K, \\"39-km-long Baramulla-Kupwara rail link with an estimated cost of Rs ,3843 crore, the survey was completed and submitted to the Railway Board in July 2020.\\" Infrastructure and construction Rail bridge in Banihal The line may be the most difficult rail project undertaken on the Indian subcontinent. The young Himalayas are geologically surprising and problematic. The track's alignment presents one of the greatest railway engineering challenges ever faced; only Tibet's Qingzang Railway, completed in 2006 across permafrost and climbing to over above sea level, is comparable. Although the Indian temperatures are less severe, the region experiences harsh winters with heavy snowfall. In the Pir Panjal Range, most peaks exceed in height. The route includes many bridges, viaducts and tunnels. The railway is expected to cross over 750 bridges and pass through over of tunnels, the longest of which is . Engineering challenges include crossing the Chenab River on a bridge above the riverbed and crossing the Anji Khad on a bridge above the riverbed. The Chenab Bridge will be the highest railway structure of its kind in the world, higher than the top of the Eiffel Tower. Both bridges will be simple. Weathering steel is planned for an environmentally-friendly appearance and to eliminate the need for painting. The design and structure is similar to West Virginia's New River Gorge Bridge. The project is managed by the Konkan Railway Corporation. Completion was scheduled for 2012 (four years after the first isolated section of the route was opened for local passenger service), and it requires 26,000 tonnes of steel. Rounding a curve in Qazigund All tunnels are built with the New Austrian tunnelling method, and a number of challenges have been encountered while tunnelling through the geologically-young, unstable Sivalik Hills. In particular, water entered the Udhampur-to-Katra section; this required drastic solutions with steel arches and several feet of shotcrete. Along with shotcrete, lattice girder support were provided according to different class of rocks found along the entire terrain of mountains in the proposed project. Although the rail line is being built through a mountainous region, a one- percent ruling gradient has been set to provide a safe, smooth, reliable journey. Bank engines will not be required, making the journey quicker and smoother. It will use Indian broad gauge continuous welded rail laid on concrete sleepers, with a minimum curve radius of 676 m. The maximum speed will be . Provision for future doubling will be made on major bridges. Provisions for future electrification will also be made, although the rail line will use diesel locomotives initially; the region is presently electricity-scarce. There will be 30 stations on the route, initially served by 10‚Äì12 trains per day. Closed-circuit television cameras at major bridges, tunnels and stations are planned, and all major bridges and tunnels are illuminated. Rolling stock Passenger train at Srinagar railway station Passenger service will be provided by high-power diesel multiple units and heated, air-conditioned coaches have wide windows, sliding doors and reclining seats. The driver's cabin has a heating and defogging unit, and is fitted with a one-piece glass window for a wider view. A snow-cutting cattle guard is attached to the front of the train to clear snow from the tracks during winter. Due to the valley's cold climate, the 1,400-horsepower diesel engine has a heating system for quick, trouble-free starts. Coaches have a public- information system (display and announcements) and a pneumatic suspension for riding comfort. There is a compartment for the physically disabled, with wider doors. Freight rolling stock for the route will come from the existing national fleet. Freight service (grain and petroleum products) will run between the 10‚Äì12 daily passenger trains. Maintenance will be done at the Badgam workshop, north of Srinagar. Three-aspect colour-light signalling is being installed on the route for safety, and GSM-R equipment may be installed in the future to improve its quality. Project agencies Indian Railways is in charge of the Udhampur-Katra section. The subsidiary Konkan Railway Corporation is in charge of the Katra-Laole section. This is arguably the line's most difficult portion, with over 92 percent tunnels or bridges‚Äî of bridges and of tunnels. Ircon International, a public-sector company, is in charge of the Dharam-Qazigund-Baramulla section. One hundred thirty-eight kilometres of the line, including the valley and the Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel, is operational. Hindustan Construction Company built the Pir Panjal tunnel through the range for about ‚Çπ900 crore. Afcons Infrastructure Limited and South Korea's Ultra Engineering will design and build the Chenab Bridge for around ‚Çπ974 crore. Gammon India and South Africa's Archirodon Construction will build the Anji Khad Bridge for ‚Çπ745 crore.

He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and studied civil engineering at the University of Edinburgh as well as geology under Robert Jameson. In 1838 he joined the ordnance survey in Ireland as a chief assistant under Joseph Ellison Portlock who was studying the geology of Londonderry and neighbourhood. Portlock wrote of him He discovered radiating fans shaped impressions in the town of Bray in 1840. He showed this to the English palaeontologist Edward Forbes, who named it Oldhamia after him. Forbes declared them to be bryozoans, however later workers ascribed it to other plants and animals. For a while these were considered the oldest fossils in the world. He became Curator to the Geological Society of Dublin, and in 1845 succeeded John Phillips, nephew of William Smith, in the Chair of Geology at Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1848. He married Louisa Matilda Dixon of Liverpool in 1850. He resigned in November that year and took a position as the first Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India. He was to be the first of the Irish geologists to migrate to the Subcontinent. He was followed by his brother Charles, William King Jr., son of William King the Professor of Geology at Queen's College, Galway; Valentine Ball and more than 12 other Irish geologists. In India he oversaw a mapping program that focussed on coal bearing strata. The team of geologists made major discoveries. Henry Benedict Medlicott coined the term \\"Gondwana Series\\" in 1872. Oldham's elder son Richard Dixon Oldham distinguished three types of pressure produced by earthquakes: now known as P (compressional), S (shear), and L (Love)-waves, based on his observations made after the Great Assam Earthquake of 1897. Richard showed in 1906 the arrival patterns of waves and suggested that the core of the earth was liquid. His younger son Henry became a reader in geography at Kings College, Cambridge. He also started the Paleontologia Indica, a series of memoirs on the fossils of India. For this work he recruited Ferdinand Stoliczka from Europe. Oldham resigned from his position in India in 1876 on the grounds of poor health and retired to Rugby in England. In recognition of his lifetime's \\"long & important services in the science of geology\\", including Palaeontographica Indica, he was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal.

A fourth program stream airs PBS programming. It is available only on cable. Previously broadcast as separate analog channels, KVZK-TV converted to digital in the late 2000s. In 2010, it received $300,000 in 2010 to convert the transmitter serving the Manu ªa Islands. History=The educational years KVZK-TV was established in 1964 as the first television service in American Samoa. It was a massive effort with a staff of 500 producing programming from four different studios to air over eight separate channels, one for each school level. Slowly, the educational uses were phased out, first in secondary and then in primary schools. Most of the non-local staff returned to the U.S. mainland. Eventually, KVZK-TV shrunk from eight channels to five, then to three‚Äîchannels 2, 4 and 5‚Äîin 1977. By 1993, KVZK-TV operated channel 2, which aired PBS programming and news from CNN; Channel 4, airing NBC programs; and Channel 5, which had aired CBS and ABC programs recorded from the Hawaii stations prior to being damaged in a 1991 hurricane. Channel 2 was also the channel on which all local programs aired‚Äîat the time, some 8.5 hours a week, including bilingual newscasts in English and Samoan, as well as special presentations. After having aired on KKHJ-LP from 2005 to 2012, NBC returned to KVZK in 2014, utilizing a direct feed of KHNL-TV provided by the American Samoa Telecommunications Authority (ASTCA). History KVZK-2 was American Samoa's first television station. It began broadcasting in black and white in 1964. Its broadcasts transitioned to color in 1969. The station, and 5 others at the same site on Mount Alava were designed to broadcast instructional material to the American Samoa Schools, many of which were located in almost inaccessible villages. The materials were produced by imported stateside teachers who prepared their instructional broadcasts in a 4-studio television center in Pago Pago. The project brought increased literacy and opened educational opportunities for the Samoan students, and was maintained for several years. Eventually, however, differences about educational theory, budget, and politics, brought the end of the comprehensive instructional program, with the remaining two stations now offering U.S. television reruns and some local programming.

McCarney was an offensive lineman at the University of Iowa from 1972 to 1974 and was named team captain in 1974. He returned to Iowa as a graduate assistant from 1977 to 1978 under Bob Commings. When Hayden Fry arrived at Iowa in 1979, he named McCarney as defensive line coach, a post he held for 10 years--during which Iowa made two appearances in the Rose Bowl. He served as the defensive coordinator and defensive line coach at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison under Barry Alvarez from 1990 to 1994. He served as head coach at Iowa State University from 1995 to 2006. During that span, McCarney led the Cyclones to five bowl games, more than any other Iowa State coach in history. The Cyclones had been to only three bowl games in their entire history before his arrival. In their first bowl appearance under McCarney, the 2000 Insight.com Bowl, the Cyclones notched their first bowl win in school history. His 56 wins and 85 losses are both school records. At the time of his resignation in November 2006, he was the longest tenured head football coach in the Big 12 Conference.

He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from through , most notably as a member of the New York Mets team that became known as the Miracle Mets when, they rose from being perennial losers to defeat the favored Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series for one of the most improbable upsets in World Series history. Swoboda performed one of the most impressive defensive plays of the series in the ninth inning of Game 4 to help preserve a Mets victory. He also played for the Montreal Expos and the New York Yankees. Major league debut Swoboda was born in Baltimore, Maryland where he graduated from Sparrows Point High School. He then played for one season at the University of Maryland, and after an impressive showing in the AAABA tournament in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Swoboda was offered a $35,000 contract to sign with the New York Mets and scout Pete Gebrian on September 5, . Swoboda spent only one season in the Mets' farm system in AA with the Williamsport Mets before making the Major League team in spring training, . At the age of 20 he made his major league debut as a pinch hitter in the season opener, and lined out in his only at- bat. He pinch hit, again, in the second game of the season, this time hitting an 11th-inning home run (the Mets still lost, as the Houston Astros had scored four runs in the top of the inning). He homered again in his first at-bat on April 18, giving him two home runs in his first four Major League at-bats. Swoboda hit 15 home runs by the All-Star break, the most ever by a Mets rookie in the first half of a season until Pete Alonso broke his record with 25 home runs in 2019. He commented during a television interview that he loved hitting fastballs; then he began seeing a lot more breaking balls and hit only four more home runs in the season. Still, his 19 home runs stood as a Mets rookie record until Darryl Strawberry's 26 in . His rookie fielding percentage was a below-league-average .947, however, he had nine outfield assists. For his efforts, he was selected to the 1965 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. His 1966 Topps baseball card was imprinted with a gold trophy symbol. In the 1966 movie Penelope, Natalie Wood, as the title character, opens a pack of 1966 Topps baseball cards, sees Swoboda's rookie card, and asks police lieutenant Horatio Bixbee (Peter Falk) \\"Who's Ron Swoboda?\\" 1966 to 1968 Swoboda wore number 14 as a rookie in 1965. When the Mets acquired third baseman Ken Boyer from the St. Louis Cardinals prior to the start of the season, they granted him number 14, as he'd worn it in St. Louis. Swoboda wore number 17 briefly during spring training in 1966, then switched to number 4. His home run drought continued through the 1966 season, when he hit only eight home runs and batted .222, with 50 runs batted in. During his early years with the Mets, Swoboda acquired the nickname \\"Rocky\\" as a result of his less-than-reliable fielding. Although he possessed a strong, accurate throwing arm, a fly ball hit in his direction was by no means a sure out. After having spent most of his time in left field his first two seasons, Swoboda was shifted to first base in to make room for newly acquired Tommy Davis in left. Swoboda's fielding at first was no better, and he was soon shifted to right field. Offensively, he had perhaps his best season, hitting .281 with 13 home runs and 53 RBIs. He led the Mets with six triples and a career-high 59 RBIs in , and also had a career-high 14 outfield assists. Miracle Mets By May 21, , the Mets won their third game in a row for a .500 winning percentage 36 games into the season for the first time in franchise history. This was followed by a five-game losing streak that saw the team fall into fourth place in the newly aligned National League East. The Mets then went on an eleven-game winning streak that brought them back into second place, seven games behind the Chicago Cubs. On September 10 the Mets swept a doubleheader against the Montreal Expos. Coupled with a loss by the Cubs, the Mets found themselves in first place for the first time in franchise history. On September 13, Swoboda hit a grand slam against the Pittsburgh Pirates to propel the Mets to a 5‚Äì2 victory. Two days later, as the St. Louis Cardinals' Steve Carlton struck out a record nineteen Mets batters in a losing effort, the Mets defeated the Cards 4‚Äì3 at Busch Memorial Stadium on a pair of two-run home runs by Swoboda. On September 24, facing Carlton and the Cardinals again, this time at Shea Stadium, the Mets clinched the NL East as Donn Clendenon hit two home runs in a 6‚Äì0 Mets victory. The Mets won 38 of their last 50 games, and finished the season with 100 wins against 62 losses, eight games ahead of the second-place Cubs. 1969 World Series Swoboda did not appear in the Mets' 1969 National League Championship Series three- game sweep of the Atlanta Braves to reach the World Series. The Mets were heavy underdogs heading into the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. In Game 4, Swoboda, not known for his fielding, made a spectacular catch of a ball hit by Brooks Robinson in the ninth inning to stop an Orioles rally. The Mets won the game 2‚Äì1 in ten innings, and subsequently, the World Series. For the World Series, Swoboda batted .400. His only RBI was the game winner of the fifth and final game. A photograph of Swoboda, stretched almost horizontally, just inches off the ground, became an iconic image for Mets fans. The Right Field entrance gate of Citi Field, the current home of the Mets, features a metal silhouette of a baseball player making a diving catch similar to the one Swoboda made during the 1969 Series.Vecsey, George. \\"Amid Great Postseason Defense, Recalling Swoboda's Catch,\\" The New York Times, Thursday, October 15, 2009. Trades In March 1971, Swoboda and minor- leaguer Rich Hacker were traded to the Montreal Expos in exchange for young outfielder Don Hahn. Three months later, the Expos traded Swoboda to the New York Yankees in exchange for outfielder Ron Woods. Swoboda played in his final major league game on September 30, 1973 at the age of 29 and, was released by the Yankees at the end of the 1973 season. He was signed by the Atlanta Braves during spring training of . The Braves, however, released him on March 25, 1974, after which Swoboda retired from baseball. He attempted an unsuccessful comeback with the Mets during spring training in . Post retirement After his retirement from baseball, Swoboda worked as a television sportscaster in New York City on WCBS-TV, on WISN - TV in Milwaukee, and for many years at WVUE in New Orleans. He also worked at Cox Sports Television. Swoboda is currently the color commentator for telecasts of games played by the New Orleans Baby Cakes, the AAA farm club of the Miami Marlins. He was also a recipient of the Thurman Munson Award in February . Swoboda appeared as himself in a episode of Everybody Loves Raymond along with several other members of the 1969 Mets. Swoboda is mostly remembered for his dramatic defensive gem during the 1969 World Series. In a guest column for the New York Daily News, Swoboda wrote, \\"I'm kidded, occasionally, by folks who wonder: 'How long are you going to keep living off of one catch?' My answer: 'How long have I got left?'\\" On June 11, 2019, Swoboda released his memoir entitled Here's the Catch: A Memoir of the Miracle Mets and More (Thomas Dunne Books). Swoboda met his wife, Cecilia, at the University of Maryland.https://ronswoboda.com/about-ron/ They were married on October 9, 1965, and had two sons, Ron, Jr. (September 13, 1966 ‚Äì January 27, 2020)https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-orleans-la/ronald- swoboda-9016667 and Brian Christopher.

Brecher was the uncle, by marriage, to Austrian bibliographer and Orientalist Moritz Steinschneider. Brecher was born in Prossnitz, Moravia. He was the first Jew of Prossnitz to study medicine or any other professional field. Brecher received his Master of Surgery and Obstetrics in Budapest in 1824. He received his Medical Doctor's or MD degree the University of Erlangen in 1849. His thesis was Das Transcendentale, Magie und Magische Heilarten im Talmud, (Vienna, 1850). Brecher's fame in Jewish literature rests principally on this work and upon his lucid commentary on the \\"Cuzari\\" of Judah ha-Levi, which appeared with the text in four parts (Prague, 1838‚Äì1840). Brecher's correspondence with Samuel David Luzzato about this commentary was also published. In addition to many contributions to scientific and literary periodicals and collections, and some important \\"Gutachten\\" (expert opinions) on social and religious questions submitted to him by imperial and local government officials, Brecher is the author of a monograph on circumcision, Die Beschneidung der Israeliten, etc., (Vienna, 1845), with an introduction by R. Hirsch Fassel of Prossnitz, and an appendix on Circumcision Among the Semitic Nations, by Moritz Steinschneider. Brecher also wrote Die Unsterblichkeitslehre des Israelitischen Volkes, Vienna, 1857, of which a French translation appeared in the same year by Isidore Cahen; and Eleh ha- Ketubim be-Shemot, a concordance of Biblical proper names, part of which was revised and published after his death by his son Adolph Brecher.

Mujahideen Should Attack Oil Infrastructure in the Middle East The strategy of enlightened moderation was unveiled by Musharraf during the 2002 OIC Summit Conference in Malaysia., p.63 Musharraf explained his position in an opinion piece that was published in various newspapers in 2004. His plan for enlightened moderation has two sides. It calls \\"for the Muslim world to shun militancy and extremism and adopt the path of socioeconomic uplift\\" and \\"for the West, and the United States in particular, to seek to resolve all political disputes with justice and to aid in the socioeconomic betterment of the deprived Muslim world\\".A Plea for Enlightened Moderation Musharraf pointed out that moderation and enlightenment have been the traits of the Islamic world since the times of Muhammad. Musharraf wrote: > I say to my brother Muslims: The time for renaissance has come. The way > forward is through enlightenment. We must concentrate on human resource > development through the alleviation of poverty and through education, health > care and social justice. If this is our direction, it cannot be achieved > through confrontation. We must adopt a path of moderation and a conciliatory > approach to fight the common belief that Islam is a religion of militancy in > conflict with modernization, democracy and secularism. All this must be done > with a realization that, in the world we live in, fairness does not always > rule. Criticism Fundamentalist Islamic organizations have criticized Musharraf's vision of enlightened moderation. The Jamaat-e-Islami condemns it as a neologism for Westernization and American imperialism. Islam is innately a religion of enlightened moderation, they argue, and needs no Westernized amendments.Jamaat-e-Islami \\"\\"Enlightened Moderation\\" or the new US 'Religious Order'\\", by prof.

M., Butler, R. J., Edwards, N. P., & Milner, A. R. (2008). Pterosaur distribution in time and space: an atlas. Zitteliana, 61-107. ) that inhabited what is now Italy. It contains a single known species, Preondactylus buffarinii, which was discovered by Nando Buffarini in 1982 at the Forni Dolostone near Udine in the Preone valley of the Italian Alps.\\"Preondactylus.\\" In: Cranfield, Ingrid (ed.). The Illustrated Directory of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Creatures. London: Salamander Books, Ltd. Pp. 284-285. Discovery Fossil wing bones When Buffarini first discovered Preondactylus, the thin slab of bituminous, dolomitic limestone containing the fossil was accidentally broken into pieces while being extracted. After reassembly the rock was cleaned with water by him and his wife and the marl and in it the bone was washed away and lost. All that was left was a negative imprint on the stone, of which a silicon rubber cast was made to allow for subsequent study of the otherwise lost remains. Most of the skeleton is known, but the posterior portions of the skull have not been preserved. This first specimen is the holotype: MFSN-1770. A second, disarticulated specimen, MFSN-1891, was found at the same locale in 1984 about 150‚Äì200 meters (490‚Äì650 ft) deeper into the strata than the original find. The second specimen appears to have been preserved in the gastric pellet of a predatory fish, which had consumed the pterosaur and vomited up the indigestible pieces that would later fossilize. More detailed knowledge of the variability of Triassic pterosaurs has made the identification of this specimen as Preondactylus uncertain, and it may even be that the remains are not those of a pterosaur at all. A third specimen is MFSN 25161, a partial skull, lacking the lower jaws. Description Restoration Preondactylus had single cusp teeth, meaning they had one point on each tooth. Its diet either consisted of fish, insects or both, but there is still debate going on as the tooth structure could indicate either diet (or both). It had short wings, whose total span was only 45 cm (18 in), and relatively long legs. The short wings were a \\"primitive\\" feature for pterosaurs, but Preondactylus was a fully developed flier. Phylogeny The species was described and named by Rupert Wild in 1984. The genus name refers to Preone, the specific name honours Buffarini. Rupert classified the new species within Rhamphorhynchidae, of which group very old species are known such as Dorygnathus, but soon it was understood the form was much more basal. A cladistic analysis by David Unwin found Preondactylus as the most basal pterosaur, and the species was accordingly used by him for a node clade definition of the clade Pterosauria. Other analyses however, have found a somewhat more derived position for Preondactylus. Fossil cast The following phylogenetic analysis follows the topology of Upchurch et al. (2015).

Center peel, \\"Australian peel\\", or simply \\"peel\\" for short, is a type of retreat practiced by modern-day infantry. This particular tactic is more specifically designed for situations where smaller groups of infantry withdraw from an engagement of a much larger force. In general terms, it is a sloped or diagonal retreat from the enemy. Definition This tactic was designed with human psychology in mind. It begins with an infantry unit facing off with a larger force of enemies. Once the command is called, the soldiers implement a column facing into the enemy's midst. The soldiers then begin, or continue, to use suppressing fire to delay the enemy's attack and advance. Depending on the direction of the retreat, the second to last soldier on the farmost end, opposite the retreating direction, calls out, \\"Peel one\\". Next, the infantryman next to him, on the end of the column, ceases fire, works his way behind the column towards the other side, takes a position one meter diagonally back from the farthest soldier on this side, and resumes suppressing fire. Then, the process repeats with the commands being simplified to \\"peel\\", the \\"one\\" only there to signify the actual start of the tactic, and continues until the party has safely disengaged the target. The slanting motion of the tactic gives the impression of increasing numbers of infantry joining the battle, a psychological move designed to deter the opposition. The slanting motion also has the benefit of keeping open one's field of fire. Retreating directly backwards would put the soldier too closely behind his own men, severely limiting his/her field of fire. In the Canadian Army, this technique is referred to as an \\"Aussie Peelback\\". In the Australian Army this tactic is known as \\"The Tunnel of Love\\" and is often used as the first part of \\"Break Contact\\" drills for small reconnaissance and special forces patrols when encountering larger enemy forces. References in film and literature The center peel tactic was demonstrated in the final gunfight of the 2003 movie, Tears of the Sun, where Lieutenant Waters (Bruce Willis) directs his men away from a significantly larger group of aggressive Nigerian troops. This tactic was also shown in episode 6 of season 2 of the Amazon Prime show, Jack Ryan, where a small group of 3 soldiers were ambushed in a ravine.

It is one of the largest crusader castles in the Levant. Construction of the castle began in the 1140s, under Pagan and Fulk, King of Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it Crac des Moabites or \\"Karak in Moab\\", as it is frequently referred to in history books. It was also colloquially referred to as Krak of the Desert.The Encyclopaedia Brittanica, Eleventh Edition, 1910. History Pagan was also Lord of Oultrejordain and Kerak Castle became the centre of his power, replacing the weaker castle of Montreal to the south. Because of its position east of the Dead Sea, Kerak Castle was able to control bedouin herders as well as the trade routes from Damascus to Egypt and Mecca. His successors, his nephew Maurice and Philip of Milly, added towers and protected the north and south sides with two deep rock-cut ditches (the southern ditch also serving as a cistern). The most notable Crusader architectural feature surviving is the north wall, into which are built immense arched halls on two levels. These were used for living quarters and stables, but also served as a fighting gallery overlooking the castle approach and for shelter against missiles from siege engines. In 1176 Raynald of Ch√¢tillon gained possession of Kerak Castle after marrying Stephanie of Milly, the widow of Humphrey III of Toron (and daughter-in-law of Humphrey II of Toron). From Kerak Castle, Raynald harassed the trade camel trains and even attempted an attack on Mecca itself. In 1183 Saladin besieged the castle in response to Raynald's attacks. The siege took place during the marriage of Humphrey IV of Toron and Isabella I of Jerusalem, and Saladin, after some negotiations and with a chivalrous intent, agreed not to target their chamber while his siege machines attacked the rest of the castle. The siege was eventually relieved by Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. Saladin besieged Kerak again in 1184. Saladin attempted to fill the ditches that prevented siege engines from getting in range of the castle wall. However, just like the first siege of Kerak, Saladin and his men left before a reinforcing crusader army could come to the castle‚Äôs aid. This siege only lasted four weeks.Lyons, M. C., and D. E. P. Jackson. Saladin: The Politics of the Holy War. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. The last siege of the 12th century was led by Sa‚Äôd Al-Din, Saladin‚Äôs nephew, in 1188. Unlike the sieges before it, the Muslim army was not under the threat of crusader reinforcements. The year before Saladin had defeated an outnumbered crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and therefore the crusaders could not gather enough troops to reinforce Kerak. The Muslim army cut off supplies to the castle, and Kerak surrendered several months after. When the castle had fallen, it is believed that it was due to lack of arms, not a lack of food. With the fall of Kerak, the Castle of Montreal, which had been replaced as the centre of the lordship by Kerak, surrendered soon afterward. In 1263, the Mamluk Sultan, Baibars, enlarged and built a tower on the northwest corner. Under the Ayyubid Dynasty, Kerak served as the administration centre for all of the regions of Jordan. When Saladin's brother, al-'Aldil was awarded control of the castle, he made it the site of one of his treasuries. Kerak would continue to serve as the home of a royal treasury for the remainder of the Ayyubid Dynasty. During some internal conflict by members of the Ayyubid Dynasty in the 1230s and 40s, Kerak was one of the three princedoms that was able to remain independent. The castle was retaken by the Egyptian Sultan al- Salih Ayyub in 1249. Kerak was so important to the Ayyubids that it is recorded that only the governors of Kerak and Damascus were allowed to carry their official correspondences on red paper. By 1263, Kerak was under the rule of the Mamluk Sultan Baybars. Under the Mamluks, Kerak continued to remain an important administrative centre. Ibn 'Abd al-Zahir stated that the castle held four ministries: the ministry of the army, the ministry of finance, the ministry of Kerak and the chancery. Due to the castle's importance, it also maintained a significant military force, which under the rule of al-Mughith, contained at least 700 horsemen. Kerak Castle was besieged again in 1834 by a rebel leader of the peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1840, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured the castle and destroyed much of its fortifications. In 1844, his troops, who did not have control over the surrounding countryside, came under siege. They were eventually starved out and many were killed.Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Report (1896). Page 328. During the Ottoman Empire, it played an important role due to its strategic location on the crossroads between the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and Greater Syria. In 1893, the Ottoman authorities reestablished control over the area by appointing a mutasarrƒ±f (governor) resident in Kerak Castle with a garrison of 1400, including 200 cavalry. Parts of the castle were reused. Some of the destruction that had occurred to the structure was due to locals removing stones containing potassium nitrate (\\"saltpetre\\"), which is used to make gunpowder.Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Report, (1896). Medieval historian Paul Deschamps studied Crusader castles in the 1920s. Amongst the important research done by Deschamps, in 1929 he and architect Francois Anus created the first accurate plans of Kerak Castle.Kennedy (1994), pp. 5‚Äì6 A night view of the castle On December 18, 2016, the castle was the site of a terrorist attack. Fourteen people were killed and 34 were injured, the majority being Jordanian security forces and local civilians. A Canadian tourist was also killed. Architecture The upper court Mamluk Sultanate with the seal of Baibars - two lions - on it Kerak Castle is an example of one of the first castles built by the Franks that used a fortified tower structure and is a notable example of Crusader architecture, a mixture of west European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. Many early Frankish castles that predate Kerak were merely towers built along the crusader states during the early years of crusading. In the second half of the twelfth century, the growing Muslim threat made crusaders update their castle design and prioritize defensive elements. Kerak Castle is a prime example of a spur castle, a castle built on top of a mountain to take advantage of the natural topography, as it is built on the southern end of a plateau surrounded on three sides by steep hills. This had the advantage during a siege of concentrating an attack on only one side of the castle, so the defenders could locate most of their manpower there. Spur castles also took advantage of \\"glacis,\\" a sloping hill that exposed attackers to the defenders. The steep hills around Kerak are characteristic of a glacis. A chapel was built on the east side of the castle, about half-way along the length of the curtain wall.Kennedy (1994), p. 47 The castle also used man-made fortifications, including ditches and thick stone walls. Because Muslim armies started to move with siege weapons such as siege engines, Frankish castles started adapting by building thicker and more solid walls. A \\"Byzantine ditch\\", a ditch to keep siege engines at a safer distance, was constructed near the castle. There is another ditch near the town which is much deeper but less wide, to the West of the castle (now almost completely filled-in). The crusaders used rough-shaped volcanic stone to build large walls around the perimeter of the castle. After Sa'd al-Din captured Kerak, the Muslims used limestone from nearby quarries to repair and expand the castle. Both the Muslim and Christian stonework show signs of draft masonry, stone blocks which are smooth on the edges, but the centre portion is left rough and raised. The castle walls are strengthened with rectangular projecting towers, pointing to the fact that it was one of the earlier castles constructed by crusaders, it was only later on in the crusades that the transition to round towers in the curtain wall was made to help with visibility. At Kerak, the towers are much closer together than at other castles, theoretically to help with visibility problems. The towers were also placed at regular points along the wall; this is called the Byzantine tower structure‚Äîthe square towers at Kerak are identical to the ones used by the Byzantine empire. While Kerak Castle is a large and strong castle, its design is less sophisticated than that of concentric crusader castles like Krak des Chevaliers, and its masonry is comparatively crude. Many of its defenses were destroyed and rebuilt during its conquest by the Ayyubid and Mamluk Dynasties. Under An-Nasir Dawud, much of the defenses of Kerak were expanded and improved in 1244-45. In 1227, the Sultan of Damascus al-Mu'azzam 'Isa, commissioned the construction of a tunnel that ran from the castle into the town.  Present day  The lower court While Kerak Castle had historically been used to protect the assets of crusader states in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, today its job is much more mundane. The city surrounding Kerak Castle is home to roughly 170,000 people and is a \\"lively tourist destination.\\" Many people travel along the ancient King's Highway to stop at Kerak on their way to other tourist sites. in 1985 the World Heritage Committee decided that Kerak should not be an UNESCO site as there were \\"more representative examples of crusader castles\\". This is in part because the castle is not in the best condition and there are multiple examples of crusader castles in the Transjordan that are in better repair. In December 2016, Kerak was the target of a terror attack that left 14 dead, including two civilians and a Canadian citizen. It is said that after clashing with police, the terrorists withdrew into the castle and held civilian hostages. There are not many references to Kerak Castle in popular-culture today, however it did play a large role in the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven. In the lower court of the castle is the Karak Archaeological Museum, which was opened in 2004 after renovation work. It introduces local history and archaeology of the region around Kerak Castle ‚Äì the land of Moab ‚Äì from prehistory until the Islamic era. The history of Crusaders and Muslims at Kerak Castle and town is introduced in detail.

Created by Presidential proclamation on January 11, 2000, the monument is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Bureau of Land Management already managed the lands; however, under monument status the level of protection and preservation of resources within the new monument have been enhanced. The monument is a unit of the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System. Over 450 distinct Native American structures have been recorded in the monument, some of large pueblos containing more than 100 rooms each. The enhanced protection status also provides greater habitat protection for the numerous plant and animal communities. Antiquities Ruins of a village built by Puebloans about 1000 years ago on top of Indian Mesa. This is part of the wall of the fort that surrounded the village. The holes in the wall are viewing holes so the defenders can view the only path to the top. There are several branches of an \\"ocotillo\\" plant in the foreground. Petroglyphs are scattered across the numerous puebloan ruins, which were built between 1250 and 1450 C.E. when several thousand Native Americans, known as the Perry Mesa Tradition, inhabited the region. The petroglyphs depict animals, geometric figures and abstract symbols and are found by the thousands. Numerous ruins of agricultural terraces and irrigation devices indicate that farming was widespread during this period. Other historical entities that are found include 19th century mining features and Basque sheep camps. Natural history Situated between and in elevation, the monument is primarily composed of semi-desert grassland but also contains extensive riparian stands of cottonwoods and willows which are tied to the Agua Fria River. More than 140 bird species have been recorded at the monument. Notable species of reptiles and amphibians, including the leopard frog, the garter snake, and the desert tortoise, can be seen at the monument. Mammals such as the pronghorn, mule deer, white-tail deer and javelina are relatively common. The elk, black bears and mountain lions are also found in the monument, but are much less common. Native fish including the longfin dace, the Gila mountain sucker, speckled dace, and three endangered native fish including the Gila intermedia, charalito, and desert pupfish exist in the -long Agua Fria River and its tributaries. In late 2004, the BLM and the Sierra Club helped spark the formation of the Friends of the Agua Fria National Monument, a non-profit organization created to assist the federal agency in monument protection, management, and outreach.

It is part of the municipality of Meg√≠sti (Kastellorizo), in the South Aegean region. Description Together with other islets in the surrounding region, Ro was the object of a sovereignty dispute in the 1920s between Turkey and Italy, which at the time was in possession of Kastellorizo and the Dodecanese islands. The dispute was solved in a 1932 treaty, which assigned Ro to the Italian side. It finally came under Greek sovereignty in 1947, together with the other former Italian possessions in the Aegean. The islet is named Kara Ada (\\"black island\\") in Turkish. History Anciently, the island was known as Rhoge ().

The species is well adapted to a variety of habitats, including city dwellings.. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by John Edward Gray in 1845.Gray, J. E. 1845. Catalogue of the specimens of lizards in the collection of the British Museum. Trustees of die British Museum/Edward Newman, London: xxvii + 289 pp. The name he gave placed this group in the genus Diplodactylus as Diplodactylus marmoratus. Gray's description was based on four specimens that were preserved in spirits. They were collected on the Abrolhos islands (off Western Australia), and were donated to the British museum from the collection of a \\"Mr. Gilbert\\". Gray examined another preserved specimen of D. marmoratus (from a different donor) which was discoloured, leading him to mistakenly describe it as a separate species (Goniodactylus australis) in the same publication. In 1885 Boulenger placed D. marmoratus in the genus Phyllodactylus (the leaf-toed geckos).Boulenger GA. 1885. Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.) I.

During the hot summer months they generally use deep crevices and burrows as their daytime retreat sites, and in cooler weather they aggregate under rocks. Riverine populations generally rest under the thick exfoliating bark of large eucalyptus trees during the daytime.Taylor D, Daniels CB, Johnston G. In Press.

C. marmoratus are commonly found in aggregations of up to 10 individuals, and most aggregations contain one male. Given that many geckos have been reported to engage in territorial behaviour,Marcellini D. 1977. Acoustic and visual display behaviour of gekkonid lizards. American Zoologist 17:251‚Äì260. it is surprising that C. marmoratus aggregate so commonly (Kearney et al. reported that one quarter of individuals they found were in aggregations).

Angiletta and Werner (1998) found that the preferred body temperature of C. marmoratus was 27.7 ¬∞C., which is much higher than their average body temperatures during the day or night. Subsequent investigation by Kearney and Predavec (2000) revealed that C. marmoratus may thermoregulate by adjusting its posture, for instance, by raising or flattening the body to contact the rock substrate. They also seem to touch the rock with their snout before doing so, as if testing the temperature. They do vocalise, however if they are not under attack (under which they may start squeaking) they rarely vocalise. References *Edgar r.

It involves three steps a fire victim should follow to minimize injury in the event their clothing catches fire. Procedure Stop, drop and roll consists of three components. # Stop ‚Äì The fire affected person must stop, ceasing any movement which may fan the flames or hamper those attempting to put the fire out. # Drop ‚Äì The fire affected person must drop to the ground, lying down if possible, covering their face with their hands to avoid facial injury. # Roll ‚Äì The fire affected person must roll on the ground in an effort to extinguish the fire by depriving it of oxygen. If the victim is on a rug or one is nearby, they can roll the rug around themselves to further extinguish the flame. The effectiveness of stop, drop and roll may be further enhanced by combining it with other firefighting techniques, including the use of a fire extinguisher, dousing with water, or fire beating one's skin. Those teaching the technique are advised to teach children the proper circumstances for its use. As such, some advice pamphlets regarding the technique suggest reminding children that this technique is only to be used in the event of catching on fire and not when a smoke alarm is sounding in a situation that requires immediate evacuation. Furthermore, some advice on the technique advises the procedure of \\"stop, drop and roll and cover your face,\\" as this will help to protect the face from any flames.

First constructed in 1930 to an American design, the wooden Big Dipper roller coaster was a mainstay of Luna Park Glenelg during its four years of operation. The ride was dismantled and shipped to Sydney when the Glenelg park went into voluntary liquidation in 1934, and became the biggest attraction of the newly opened Luna Park Milsons Point (which was later renamed Luna Park Sydney). The ride was long, lasted three minutes, could reach speeds of , and when all three roller coaster trains were operating, could carry 72 people. The Big Dipper remained popular throughout its operating life. The coaster became inactive when Luna Park was closed following the 1979 Sydney Ghost Train fire, and was demolished and burned, along with most of the 'old' Luna Park, when Australian Amusements Associates took over the site on 3 June 1981. Two of the nine roller coaster cars were purchased at the auction before the demolition; one is on display within Luna Park today, while the other is part of the Powerhouse Museum collection. Incidents The Big Dipper in its original location at Luna Park Glenelg On New Year's Eve 1932, a woman who was improperly seated and not holding on fell from the Big Dipper, and died in hospital the next day. Although allegations of intoxication or mechanical failure were made, the inquest concluded that the woman had committed suicide. On 26 April 1946, a 33-year-old man from New Caledonia was killed on the ride.Marshall, Luna Park, p. 82 He disobeyed safety instructions by sitting on the edge of a train car, and was thrown from the ride on one of the corners and into a support pole. On 16 April 1979, 13 people were injured on the Big Dipper. A steel runner had come loose, halting one of the three rollercoaster trains.Marshall, Luna Park, pp. 108-9 The following train rammed the stationary one, causing the injuries. Successor In 1994, a steel roller coaster was installed at Luna Park, and was given the Big Dipper name. Legal action against the new roller coaster led to significant restrictions in its operational availability, which contributed to the 1996 closure of Luna Park. The ride was sold to Dreamworld in 2001, where it currently operates as Hot Wheels SideWinder.

It was released on December 4, 1987 in Japan, and May 1988 in North America. It is based on the film Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). Gameplay The game starts off with Colonel Trautman asking Rambo whether or not he wants to leave the prison and start the mission. Players are given a choice, but cannot advance in the game unless \\"yes\\" is chosen. Players advance through the camp and talk to others, and when talking to Trautman again, he tells Rambo the mission. Rambo then drops into the forest and fights spiders and other forest creatures. Bosses include giant spiders and helicopters. The game is noted for its identical gameplay to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, in that the player can kill enemies for experience points and the layouts are similar. In the Japanese version, the experience meter is replaced by an anger meter, however, it functions exactly the same. Later in the game, Rambo picks up an arsenal of weapons and fights enemy soldiers, but this happens close to the end of the game. The ending sequence allows the player to throw a giant kanji character (ÊÄí, Ikari:Anger) towards Murdock after returning to the base, which inexplicably turns Murdock into a frog. The USA version ends with a simple \\"End\\", but the Japanese Famicom version contains staff credits. It is unknown why this was left out of the USA version.

In 2001, after the September 11 attacks in New York, the FAA would not allow travelers to carry bags or laptops in the passenger cabin, this derailed the company and it followed up by laying off 90% of its workforce. In the interim, Tenzing deployed a very-low-bandwidth system in partnership with Verizon AirFone's radiotelephone network. This system was in commercial operation on United Airlines and a few other U.S. carriers for more than a year before being discontinued. In 2004, Tenzing merged its operations into a new company, OnAir, formed with SITA and Airbus.

It usually overlaps with query tuning, but refers to design of the database files, selection of the database management system (DBMS) application, and configuration of the database's environment (operating system, CPU, etc.). Database tuning aims to maximize use of system resources to perform work as efficiently and rapidly as possible. Most systems are designed to manage their use of system resources, but there is still much room to improve their efficiency by customizing their settings and configuration for the database and the DBMS. I/O tuning Hardware and software configuration of disk subsystems are examined: RAID levels and configuration, block and stripe size allocation, and the configuration of disks, controller cards, storage cabinets, and external storage systems such as SANs. Transaction logs and temporary spaces are heavy consumers of I/O, and affect performance for all users of the database. Placing them appropriately is crucial. Frequently joined tables and indexes are placed so that as they are requested from file storage, they can be retrieved in parallel from separate disks simultaneously. Frequently accessed tables and indexes are placed on separate disks to balance I/O and prevent read queuing. DBMS tuning= DBMS users and DBA experts  DBMS tuning refers to tuning of the DBMS and the configuration of the memory and processing resources of the computer running the DBMS. This is typically done through configuring the DBMS, but the resources involved are shared with the host system. Tuning the DBMS can involve setting the recovery interval (time needed to restore the state of data to a particular point in time), assigning parallelism (the breaking up of work from a single query into tasks assigned to different processing resources), and network protocols used to communicate with database consumers. Memory is allocated for data, execution plans, procedure cache, and . It is much faster to access data in memory than data on storage, so maintaining a sizable cache of data makes activities perform faster. The same consideration is given to work space. Caching execution plans and procedures means that they are reused instead of recompiled when needed. It is important to take as much memory as possible, while leaving enough for other processes and the OS to use without excessive paging of memory to storage. Processing resources are sometimes assigned to specific activities to improve concurrency. On a server with eight processors, six could be reserved for the DBMS to maximize available processing resources for the database.  Automatic DB tuning  Utilizes machine learning to learn to evaluate performance under various workloads.https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/dbms_tuning.pdf Database maintenance Database maintenance includes backups, column statistics updates, and defragmentation of data inside the database files. On a heavily used database, the transaction log grows rapidly. Transaction log entries must be removed from the log to make room for future entries. Frequent transaction log backups are smaller, so they interrupt database activity for shorter periods of time. DBMS use statistic histograms to find data in a range against a table or index. Statistics updates should be scheduled frequently and sample as much of the underlying data as possible. Accurate and updated statistics allow query engines to make good decisions about execution plans, as well as efficiently locate data. Defragmentation of table and index data increases efficiency in accessing data. The amount of fragmentation depends on the nature of the data, how it is changed over time, and the amount of free space in database pages to accept inserts of data without creating additional pages.

Simoni and Robert L. Hill, 2009, DNA Transcription and tRNA Ligase: the Work of John Abelson, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 284, e20-21.) is an American molecular biologist with expertise in biophysics, biochemistry, and genetics. He was a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Biography Abelson graduated in 1960 with a bachelor's degree in physics from Washington State University. He obtained his Ph.D. in biophysics from Johns Hopkins University in 1965. He then did a postdoctoral fellowship in biochemistry at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Molecular Genetics Division, Cambridge, England, where he worked with Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick on the mechanism of nonsense suppressors in E.coli. This work involved both genetics and RNA sequencing (developed at that time by Fred Sanger). His first faculty position was in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, San Diego in 1968. In 1978, Abelson and his colleague Mel Simon founded Agouron Institute, a non-profit research organization that sponsors innovative research in biology. He is the president and executive director of the institute. The institute has a substantial endowment because it founded a for-profit-company, Agouron Pharmaceuticals, six years later. This company, a pioneer in rational drug design, discovered and brought to market Viracept, a leading drug used for controlling HIV infections. In 1999, the company was bought by Warner Lambert for $2.1 Billion, and in 2000 Warner Lambert was acquired by Pfizer Incorporated. The institute has funded more than $60 million of research in the fields of structural biology, geobiology and microbial ecology. Abelson was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1980‚Äì1981.John Simon Guggenheim Foundation  John N. Abelson In 1982 he joined the faculty at Caltech. He chaired the Division of Biology there and became the George Beadle Professor of Biology in 1991. He retired in 2002 and lives in San Francisco, where he currently works with his wife, Christine Guthrie, a noted RNA biochemist, geneticist and Professor at UCSF. Abelson was a key figure in the elucidation of RNA splicing, in collaboration with his wife, noted geneticist Christine Guthrie. His work has made possible an understanding of how genomic DNA can be transcribed and the transcripts processed to both messenger RNA and transfer RNA, particularly when there are introns present in the genome. He identified the enzymes that cleave RNA precursors into fragments, and elucidated the mechanisms by which fragments are spliced together to make the functional RNA. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1985. The same year Abelson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is currently an editor of the influential scientific book series, Methods in Enzymology.  See also  List of RNA biologists  Note  His uncle, Philip Abelson, a physicist, was the longtime editor of Science and his aunt, Neva Martin Abelson co- developed the blood test for Rh factor.

He has been an Emeritus Professor of biochemistry and genetics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison since 1997. Early life Adler was born in Edelfingen, Germany in 1930. He came to the United States in 1938 at the age of 8 and became a naturalized citizen in 1943. His family settled in Grand Forks, North Dakota where their relatives were among the first Europeans to arrive in 1880. Since he was child, Adler had been fascinated by how organisms sense and respond to the environment. Education Adler attended Harvard University and received his A.B. in Biochemical Sciences in 1952. He then studied with Henry A. Lardy at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and earned an M.S. in Biochemistry in 1954 and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1957. After graduating, Adler did postdoctoral fellowships with Arthur Kornberg in the Department of Microbiology at Washington University School of Medicine (1957‚Äì59) and A. Dale Kaiser in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine (1959‚Äì60).The postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford brought Adler into contact with Esther Lederberg. Adler's subsequent eight-year correspondence with Esther Lederberg resulted in See http://www.estherlederberg.com/EImages/Archive/Adler/Correspondence.html Adler returned to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison to join the faculty of the Departments of Biochemistry and Genetics as an assistant professor in 1960. He was promoted to associate professor in 1963 and became professor in 1966. He became an emeritus professor in 1997.Emeritus page for Julius Adler He became Edwin Bret Hart Professor in 1972 and was Steenbock Professor of Microbiological Sciences from 1982 to 1992. Contribution to understanding bacterial chemotaxis His work was inspired by a butterfly he saw in the woods when he was a child. This interest in butterflies expanded to include other organisms. It evolved into a curiosity about the behavior of organisms. He thought the behaviors of the monarch butterfly laying eggs on milkweeds and the caterpillars staying on the milkweed until maturity can be explained by volatile chemicals from the milkweed. To study how organisms sense and respond to the environment, Adler decided to study the behavior of bacteria and then ultimately broaden out to the behavior of all organisms. In 1880, Wilhelm Pfeffer, a famous German botanist, had used motile bacteria to study attraction and repulsion by various plant and animal extracts and chemicals. Adler built on this work. Using the system in Escherichia coli, Adler showed that bacteria sensed attractants and repellants with sensory proteins he termed chemoreceptors. These findings led to the discovery of the methylation of a protein in the envelope of E. coli that is involved in chemotaxis. This protein is methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) and it acquires methyl groups from methionine. Adler also identified the methylated residue of MCP. Adler eventually discovered that E. coli contain several MCPs which play important roles in chemotaxis sensory transduction system. Strains of bacteria without this protein, or lacking the ability to methylate and demethylate them were unable to respond to stimuli. An increase in concentration of attractants led to an increase in methylation level of MCP; similarly, a decrease in attractants or increase in repellents led to a decrease in methylation level. By the 1980s, it was determined that bacterial chemotaxis resulted from the regulation of flagellar rotation by chemoreceptors. Bacteria swam more smoothly due to a counterclockwise rotation of their flagella in the presence of increasing attractant. In a decreasing attractant gradient, there is an increase in bacterial tumbling, produced by a clockwise flagellar rotation. Adler isolated bacterial envelopes and found that he could restore counterclockwise flagellar rotation by adding artificial electron donors and an energy source. This suggested that the driving force behind counterclockwise flagellar rotation was the proton electrochemical potential. Current work Adler is currently doing research on sensory reception and decision making in Drosophila fruitflies. Flies are presented with attractant and/or repellent, and mutants that are neither attracted nor repelled are isolated. Defects in the mutants will be studied in hope of revealing the mechanisms involved.

Espuelas is one of the pioneers of the consumer Internet. He is the co-founder (along with Jack Chen) and first CEO of Starmedia, the first pan-Latin Internet portal, launched in 1996 and now part of Orange, France Telecom's Internet services company. Starmedia was the first venture-capital backed Latin Internet company and also the first initial public offering (IPO) in the Latin Internet industry. According to the Harvard Business School case StarMedia: Launching a Latin American Revolution, \\"by the fall of 1999, StarMedia had sprinted to a sizable lead in the race to acquire Latin American Internet users. Its pan-regional, horizontal portal was the first to target Spanish- and Portuguese-language speakers on the Internet, registering 1.2 billion page views in the third quarter of 1999. Thirty-three- year-old StarMedia co-founder Fernando Espuelas was the toast of \\"Silicon Alley\\" and a recognized hero throughout Latin America. A picture of him on the cover of Internet World magazine--ripping his shirt open to show the Starmedia logo, like Superman, summed up the spirit of the company.\\" By the year 2000, Starmedia was the world's leading Latin portal, serving over 25 million Spanish and Portuguese speakers every month across Latin markets in America and Europe, making it one of the top sites by audience size in the world. Espuelas is a Henry Crown Fellow at the Aspen Institute. Many years before social media would play a leading role in the Arab Spring, Espuelas presaged that the Internet would provoke an \\"uncontrollable wave of democracy\\" and give \\"the power of information and communication to the individual, not to institutions.\\" In 2012, Espuelas was named one of \\"The Nation's 100 Most Influential Hispanics\\" by Poder Magazine. Time included Espuelas on their list of the \\"Leaders of the Millennium\\", and he was recognized as a \\"2000 All-Star\\" business leader by Crain's New York Business magazine. The World Economic Forum includes him among its \\"Global Leaders of Tomorrow, \\" and he was also a recipient of Latin Trade Magazine 's Bravo Award, being named \\"Internet CEO of the Year\\". He received a New York Award in 1999. Hispanic Business magazine gave Espuelas its Hispanic Entrepreneur Award in 2000. He was also named a \\"Latin American Leader of the Internet\\" by CNN en Espa√±ol Espuelas has been part of the \\"power-list\\" of such diverse media as The Hollywood Reporter The Industry Standard, Latino Leaders Magazine, Red Herring Magazine, Silicon Alley Reporter, Hispanic Business Magazine, CNN, Upside Magazine, and Hispanic Magazine. Espuelas was also named \\"Immigrant of the Day\\" by Immigration Daily in 2008. Espuelas was the co-founder and Chairman of the StarMedia Foundation which, in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank and Microsoft, built technology training schools in poor neighborhoods in Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. Espuelas served on the Board of Directors of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, operators of PBS' New York flagship television station Thirteen (WNET) and sister station WLIW, as well as on the Board of Trustees of Connecticut College. In 2009, Espuelas became a spokesman for the Los Angeles Parent's Union, also known as Parent Revolution, a non-profit group that seeks to reform public education across the United States. In 2010, Espuelas was elected to the Board of Directors of Parent Revolution. Latinvision.com selected Espuelas as one of the \\"Top 50 Who Matter Most!\\" list of Latino media executives in 2008. The U.S. Hispanic IT Executive Council named Espuelas in 2009 and 2010 to its HITEC 100, the list of \\"Most Influential Hispanics and Rising Stars in Information Technology\\". In 2008, Espuelas created Radio Espuelas, a drivetime, daily bilingual talkshow broadcast on the Univision Radio Network, and online at Clear Channel Communications' IHeartRadio. A first for Univision, the leading Spanish- language media company in the United States, Espuelas' national show is broadcast in English. In 2012, The Fernando Espuelas Show was re-launched as part of the new Univision America Network. Espuelas also writes for the Huffington Post, The Hill, and CNN and is a frequent commentator on television, such as CBS News, radio on Univision and NPR, as well in print across the world. Childhood In Life in Action, Espuelas writes about studying at the Elbio Fern√°ndez school, a prestigious private school in Montevideo. Espuelas' family in Uruguay was financially secure until his father, a real estate entrepreneur, abandoned them when he was 8 years old. Seeking to survive at a time when Uruguay experienced acute political and economic crisis, Espuelas and his mother immigrated to the United States in 1976 with only $100. After a series of factory jobs making everything from dresses to ice cream sandwiches, his mother found work as a housekeeper in Greenwich, Connecticut. Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, \\"As a kid I had to leave my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got divorced and my mother couldn't support herself. We lost everything overnight, so we came to the United States. For 10 years we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and my mother worked 12 hours a day. It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world. Personally, I always know I'll be able to survive.\\" As he recounted on PBS' Tavis Smiley show, Espuelas started his first business in Greenwich while in the fifth grade, when he convinced his friends to invest in a kids' bank and insurance company. The next year, he founded the first student government in North Street School and was elected President of his class. He later began the school's newspaper, serving as editor-in-chief. According to the Latino Leaders article \\"Making a comeback: the Fernando Espuelas Story \\", \\"Espuelas had to become the man of the house, while his mother got a job as a housekeeper in wealthy Greenwich, Connecticut.\\" \\"It was quite difficult to have all that responsibility at first. We were one of the only Latin families growing up. It was very interesting to be in that environment; it was such a complete departure from our lives in Uruguay. Essentially, we were in a place where people didn't want you, and didn't understand what you were about\\", he said. And though Espuelas did not speak any English, \\"growing up like that provided a tremendous incentive for me to learn. \\" \\"Because they were desperate for money, a still-enterprising Espuelas started a bank and an insurance company--his first US business, at the age of ten. \\"I managed to convince some of my wealthy sixth grade friends to invest. It was a very simple business though: we were just able to give money to kids who needed to borrow it. It was successful, and I was very proud of that. \\" Espuelas attended Greenwich High School, graduating in 1984. At Greenwich High, Espuelas was the President of the Debate Team, the Connecticut State Champion debater in 1982, and the Chairman of the Political Action Club. Espuelas hosted the local Public-access television cable TV show \\"The Bottom Line with Fernando Espuelas\\", interviewing Greenwich personalities. Espuelas worked a series of jobs while going to junior high and high school: gardener, gas station attendant, Woolworth's clerk, restaurant worker; movie usher; newspaper delivery boy, messenger, Chinese food delivery person, pet shop cleaner, baby sitter, electronics board assembler in an electronic church organ manufacturing company, clerk at a soda fountain; greeting card salesman, and as an intern at Philip Morris' headquarters in New York. In 1988, Espuelas graduated \\"with distinction\\" from Connecticut College with a degree in history. While at Connecticut College, Espuelas was first Managing Editor, then Editor-in-Chief and eventually Publisher of the college's newspaper, The College Voice and its associated publications. Espuelas also served as the President of Branford House, as well as on several college-wide faculty- student-administration committees, including the College's Education Committee. He was later elected to the board of trustees of Connecticut College. Career In 1988, Espuelas was hired as an assistant account executive by Wunderman Worldwide, a division of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. While at Wunderman, Espuelas worked on the American Express, General Foods Gevalia and Weight Watchers accounts. After a year at Wunderman, he became an account executive at Interpublic Group of Companies's Lowe & Partners to work on the agency's Citibank Visa account. In 1991, Espuelas returned to South America to work at Ogilvy & Mather's Argentine operations. In Argentina, Espuelas was the founding Managing Director of Ogilvy & Mather Direct. Starting with one account, Espuelas led the company to be O&M; Argentina's single largest source of profit by the second year of operations. After two months in Argentina, Espuelas was additionally named head of the company's Unilever account, responsible for a portfolio of global brands such as Dove and Pond's. The Unilever business was one of the most important accounts for O&M; in Argentina and across its worldwide network. At the end of 1991, Espuelas was elected to the Board of Directors of Ogilvy & Mather Argentina, at the age of 25. \\"It was really unbelievable-I went from being an account executive in New York to being the managing director of a company and director of a big client's business. That was really incredible!... The experience would have taken me five years to accumulate in New York, and I was able to gather it in six months.\\" Espuelas said to Latino Leaders. \\"My businesses were 35 percent of the profits for the whole company it was just a tremendous growth experience. \\" With all the years he spent in the US, Espuelas found himself needing to relearn Spanish. \\"This was very challenging, but after two and a half years I was able to regain my proficiency in the language. The funny thing was that it actually helped business; the executives there loved the fact that I sounded like a gringo!\\" Another amusing fact: Espuelas had to lie about his age, because \\"I looked so young!\\" In 1994 AT&T; recruited Espuelas to lead the roll-out of the AT&T; brand throughout Latin America. Within a year, he was promoted to Managing Director of Marketing Communications for the Latin American and Caribbean region, becoming one of the youngest executives of that rank at the company. While at AT&T;, Espuelas conceived and launched AT&T; Hola and AT&T; Ola (in Portuguese), the company's first online service. A combination of news feeds from Reuters, interactive forums, online games and the first search engine that searched in Spanish and Portuguese, AT&T; Hola/Ola was positively received by both the media and consumers across Latin America. In 1996, Espuelas envisioned the portal that would \\"unite\\" Latin America: Starmedia. \\"With the Internet, we're talking about a fundamental shift in the power structure from the institution to the individual,\\" Espuelas said. After a frustrating year and a half of approaching venture capitalists to invest in his vision, only to have them uniformly refuse, many avowing that Latins \\"did not like technology\\" and would never use the Internet, the company went on to raise $2.5 million in 1997. It was the first venture capital ever invested in a Latin Internet company. Over the next four years, the company raised over $500 million in investments, including capital from Chase Manhattan Bank, GE Capital, eBay, the Hearst Corporation, Intel Capital, NBC and David Rockefeller. According to the New York City Investment Fund, \\"[Espuelas]... spoke about the impact, similar to that of economic integration on European nations, that his business would have unifying Latin American people separated by national borders. A board member interrupted him. It was David Rockefeller, retired head of Chase Manhattan, brother of Nelson, and a longtime pillar-the pillar-of corporate involvement in New York City life. Rockefeller wanted to hear more. He invited Espuelas to his office.\\" \\"It was the most exciting thing in my life\\", says the entrepreneur. He recalls how the meeting went: \\"I didn't close the sale with him until I showed him a map of Latin America without any borders. He said, 'Oh, that's good.'\\" Rockefeller and the Fund became investors in StarMedia, which moved its headquarters from Connecticut to the city and quickly grew to more than 700 employees worldwide. Espuelas tells this story at a reception that New York's corporate elite was throwing for Rockefeller's 86th birthday. He introduces Rockefeller as his \\"shareholder, partner, and inspiration.\\" \\"They have managed to come up with a pretty big capital raising at the intersection of two of the most volatile investment themes in America: the Internet and Latin America\\", said Lanny Baker, an analyst of on-line media industry for Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco.\\"San Francisco Chronicle, Viva Internet: StarMedia Inc. lands $80 million to fund Latin American Web community In 1999, the company went public on the Nasdaq, the first Latin Internet company ever to do so, eventually reaching a market valuation of over $3.8 billion USD at its peak. Starmedia had over 1,200 employees in 18 offices across 12 countries in the Americas and Europe. Today, Starmedia is France Telecom's single largest Internet operation in the world, according to company statements. Espuelas later launched Voy, a multi-platform media company focused on young Latino consumers. \\"Among younger, second-generation Hispanics, English is the preferred language, even as they celebrate their Latin backgrounds\\", reported The New York Sun. \\"What we wanted to do by launching Voy Music was really take advantage of two dynamics\\", said Voy Chairman Fernando Espuelas. \\"The majority of Latinos in this country are bilingual or English dominant, and there are millions of non- Latinos who love Latino music\\", Espuelas told the Associated Press in 2005. \\"You must have Latinos as part of your core strategy if you are looking for growth\\", Espuelas told The New York Sun in 2006. According to The Sun Sentinel, \\"Voy Music executives say they're tapping a strong market. A study this year by AOL/Roper that found that 55 percent of U.S. Hispanics like to listen to music when online, compared with 41 percent for the general U.S. population. And 37 percent of Latinos had downloaded music, vs. 25 percent for the U.S. population.\\" Voy was named winner of the best \\"Start-Up Company\\" award at the Multicultural Media Expo in 2006. In 2007, Forrester Research's study \\"Hispanic Social Computing Takes-off\\" ranked Voy's sites as the leading Latin social network pure-play brand in the United States. Voy also released the award-winning documentary, Favela Rising through its Voy Pictures unit. The film received widespread critical acclaim. Espuelas said at the time of the release, \\"Favela Rising encapsulates the Voy philosophy of optimism and self-empowerment. The film's message of hope transforms people, motivates and inspires us to action.\\" Telling the true story of one man's struggle against violence and racism to start a social movement for peace, Favela Rising won more than 35 major international awards and was short listed for an Academy Award nomination. It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2005 and was seen around the world through the film festival circuit. In 2006 it opened in theaters across the U.S. and Brazil and later made its U.S. television debut on HBO/Cinemax. Squeezed by the 2008 capital markets crisis and unable to raise additional venture funding, Voy restructured its operations, including lay-offs of staff in the U.S. and Latin America, and put itself up for sale. VOY however did not close transactions with competing buyers and ceased operations. The Deal magazine reported, \\"Espuelas couldn't have picked a more challenging era in which to launch a media company. The Internet has transformed everything from distribution to consumer behavior. Ironically, Espuelas erred in underestimating the one medium he should have understood best, the Internet. It took a middle-of-the-night epiphany to remind him of what he should have known all along: It's the Internet, stupid. In 2007, Espuelas was named a Henry Crown Fellow.Aspen Institute Aspen Institute Espuelas created in 2008 The Fernando Espuelas Show, a drive-time, daily radio talkshow on Univision Radio Los Angeles, the nation's second largest radio market and biggest market for Latino radio. Espuelas hosts and is managing editor of the radio program which is distributed nationally by the Univision Radio Network.

Espuelas makes frequent public appearances including live performances such as the Fernando Espuelas Live! show that sold out the historic Alex Theatre in Glendale, California. The Fernando Espuelas Show was Univision's first English-language talkshow. Poder MagazinePoder Magazine ‚Äì \\"The Nation's 100 Most Influential Hispanics\\" \\" named Espuelas one of \\"The Nation's 100 Most Influential Hispanics\\" in 2012 for the show's empowering of \\"...Latinos to be part of the American political system....\\" Also in 2012, The Fernando Espuelas Show was re-launched as part of the new talk-radio Univision America Network. StarMedia In a highly publicized moment of inspiration that was recounted in numerous articles and television segments, Espuelas envisioned a \\"virtual plaza to connect the peoples of Latin America\\" while hiking atop a mountain in Nepal. Soon after, Espuelas founded Starmedia with his Chinese-American childhood friend, Jack Chen. As Starmedia's Chairman and CEO, collaborating with co-founder and Starmedia President Jack Chen, Espuelas created the first Internet media company for Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking audiences worldwide. Using a combination of their 12 credit cards, family savings, and loans from friends, the pair managed to piece together the first $100,000 used to launch the Latin portal in September 1996. \\"Shares of StarMedia Networks, the most highly anticipated of last week's offerings, closed 74 percent above its initial offering price of $15 per share on Wednesday, its first day of trading,\\" reported The New York Times at the time of StarMedia's IPO. Gail Bronson, an analyst at IPO Monitor, said on CNN, \\"StarMedia is the behemoth south of the border.\\" Eventually Starmedia raised over US$500 million in equity in a series of private and public offerings. Starmedia's market capitalization reached over $3.8 billion. Starmedia's success served as an important catalyst in the development of the Latin Internet market by encouraging both entrepreneurs and financiers to back the development of the sector. According to ComputerWorld, \\"StarMedia's success is credited with igniting the vibrant enthusiasm that the Latin America Internet market currently enjoys, and which has led a number of companies to follow in StarMedia's footsteps, including big guns like Spain's Telefonica SA, America Online Inc. (AOL), Yahoo, Lycos, Brazil's UOL Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as cocky startups like Patagon.com International Ltd., Zona Financiera Inc. and Yupi Internet Inc.\\" As of 2011, there were an estimated 212+ million Internet users in Latin America. According to Institutional Investor, \\"the $110 million IPO in May [1999] for StarMedia Networks, the Internet company [Espuelas] founded three years earlier, marked a watershed in the history of Latin America's financial markets. For the first time, a pan-regional company built from scratch and headquartered in New York has sold shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market to mainly United States investors to finance its expansion in Latin America.\\" \\"Today, New York City-based StarMedia is widely seen as a market pioneer and, so far, as the player to beat in the Latin America portal market. The company has about 700 employees, operations in 9 countries and partnerships with companies such as AT&T;, Visa International Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co,\\" added ComputerWorld. Speaking to The New York Times, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said \\"I applaud the company for contributing to the continued growth of the city's high-tech community.\\" At the time of the IPO, Espuelas told CNET: \\"I think we present a unique story, where maybe the other companies were versions of companies that already existed. We also have market leadership, we have a big brand, we're the first mover into a really big market with a lot of growth potential, and I think the market recognized that and sort of differentiated us from just another Internet IPO.\\" \\"The strategy is simple: Build on being the first Internet service to cater to Latin American PC owners on a regional basis rather than country by country, and try to keep a step ahead of the inevitable competition. So far, the positioning has allowed StarMedia to make deals with Fox Latin America for sports and children's programming, with Dow Jones for financial news, and with Viacom Spelling Entertainment Group for TV show Melrose Place and other nighttime soap operas\\", explained Business Week in the article \\"Welcoming Spanish Speakers to the Web: Fast-growing StarMedia is Racing to Fill the Niche First\\" Espuelas added: \\"We are literally creating an industry, we have built, but will continue to construct, the biggest brand in Latin America.\\" In the 1999 story in The New York Times, \\"C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops\\", Espuelas explained his approach: \\"I spent a lot of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor‚Äînot having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement‚Äîto think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy.\\" According to a Harvard Business School case, written by professors Thomas Eisenmann and John K. Rust, \\"by the fall of 1999, StarMedia had sprinted to a sizable lead in the race to acquire Latin American Internet users. Its pan- regional, horizontal portal was the first to target Spanish- and Portuguese- language speakers on the Internet, registering 1.2 billion page views in the third quarter of 1999. Thirty-three-year-old StarMedia co-founder Fernando Espuelas was the toast of \\"Silicon Alley\\" and a recognized hero throughout Latin America. A picture of him on the cover of Internet World magazine-- ripping his shirt open to show the StarMedia logo, like Superman, summed up the spirit of the company.\\" Espuelas created a communications culture to connect StarMedia's 18 offices in 12 countries. \\"[Espuelas]... will set a goal at one meeting, and by the time the next one rolls around, we've made tremendous progress.... Each meeting has a clear goal‚Äîto deliver quarterly results, to announce a major initiative or partnership, to clarify our strategic vision. Whenever possible, Fernando and other executives make their comments trilingually. That sometimes generates good-natured teasing about accents, but our employees really appreciate the effort. To make certain that nothing is lost in the translations, someone from each office recaps the entire announcement in that country's native tongue. Then we follow up with an online chat, during which the management team fields questions from employees\\", said Gally Bar-on, chief of staff, StarMedia Network Inc. and president, StarMedia Foundation. \\"Our overriding goal is to communicate clearly across language barriers and geographic boundaries. By connecting with all of our offices -- and by addressing everyone in three languages -- we're able to unite our employees around one company vision...The one thing that we hear consistently from our employees is, 'We want more Fernando.' They want to know what he's thinking. This meeting allows him to communicate his vision\\", added Bar-on. In a ComputerWorld interview Espuelas said, \\"What we have to do is remain absolutely focused on giving our users the best possible experience, and giving our partners and advertisers a mutually profitable relationship. We're really looking forward, not backwards. All of this competition has stimulated the market in a very dramatic fashion, in terms of marketing, in terms of growing the market, in terms of the attention of advertisers, partners and Wall Street. So we see it very positively. We just need to make sure we're never satisfied with ourselves, and we're not. We can always be better and faster and more efficient.\\" In the Business Week cover story \\"La Vida Loca of a Latin Web Star\\" Espuelas is described as: \\"If ever there were a poster boy for the bilingual, bicultural executive of the Internet age, it's Fernando J. Espuelas, the 33-year-old chairman and chief executive of New York-based StarMedia Networks Inc. The Spanish- and Portuguese-language portal offers everything from chat rooms to shopping. Born in Uruguay, Espuelas moved to the U.S. at age 10. He has worked much of his adult life in Latin America, but when wooing investors, he's all Wall Street.\\" The company's high profile, as manifested in its thousands of press articles across the world, ensured that the whole Latin Internet sector benefited from a constant source of positive attention and relevance. Billions of dollars were subsequently invested in Latin America by foreign and local companies, international venture capitalists and buy-out firms seeking to capitalize in the fast growth of this new segment. Myriad companies were created and funded, telecommunications companies made significant investments in infrastructure to meet the demand, and governments and other key sectors of the society, specifically the news media, adopted Web tools to modernize. Espuelas sought to \\"...redefine history ‚Äì and I think that, in fact, is what happened...The StarMedia idea of Pan Latin Americanism, an idea with deep historical roots, was a profound turning point for Latinos across the world.\\" Espuelas, a skilled marketer armed with cash from his successful IPO, was the mastermind of massive marketing campaigns promoting the StarMedia brand. \\"We want to be the Coca-Cola of the Internet in Latin America,\\" Espuelas said. In the process, Espuelas became iconic as the \\"poster boy\\" of the Latin Internet, appearing on the cover of magazines, in television shows and even in CNN's own promotions: a brief image of Espuelas was included, amongst other renowned politicians and celebrities, within the 15 second top-of-hour CNN on-air network ID. On May 25, 1999, StarMedia completed the first public offering on Nasdaq for a Latin Internet company, selling 7 million shares at $15. The company went on to raise hundreds of millions more capital over the next two years. By 2000, at age 34, Espuelas was acknowledged as one of the main players in Silicon Alley and the Latino Internet industry. Uruguay's leading newspaper, El Pa√≠s, dubbed him \\"The Emperor of the Internet\\" on its front page. CNN filmed a documentary on Espuelas‚Äô life that was broadcast across the world. The media referred to Espuelas as \\"The Hispanic Bill Gates\\" and the \\"Sim√≥n Bol√≠var of the Internet\\", terms that would be often recapitulated in thousands of articles and interviews referencing Starmedia. In February 2000, Starmedia created Latin America's first free, ad-supported regional internet service provider with a $200 million investment from CMGI Inc., Flatiron Partners, Chase Capital Partners and 1stUp.com. On August 5, 2001, after a disagreement with the Board regarding the strategic direction of the company, Espuelas resigned as CEO of StarMedia but agreed to stay on as Chairman until November 15, 2001 to effect an orderly management transition. At that time, he was replaced by Susan Segal as head of the company; Segal was a venture capitalist, representing Chase Manhattan Bank's Chase Capital Partners, which had given Starmedia its first round of institutional financing in 1997. Segal then led the company's new strategy to divest itself of its market leading portal assets, including the StarMedia brand and network of websites, and focus the company on its mobile unit, StarMedia Mobile. The resulting new company, Cyclelogic, was led by Segal until it filed for bankruptcy in 2003. As part of Segal's new strategy, in July 2002, StarMedia was sold for $8 million to EresMas, a Spanish ISP. EresMas was then sold to a unit of France Telecom, Internet subsidiary Wanadoo, 10 days later for $255 million euros. EresMas' new leadership of the Latin Internet (through the purchase of StarMedia the previous week) was cited by France Telecom as the reason for the acquisition. Espuelas writes in Life in Action: \\"Because I believed in our company and our mission, I had never sold a single StarMedia share or stock option. I personally lost close to $500 million.\\" In 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Espuelas and the rest of StarMedia's senior executive team alleging in a civil lawsuit that the accounting treatment of a certain transaction relating to StarMedia's Mexican subsidiaries did not meet GAAP accounting standards. The civil lawsuit relates to accounting decisions made by StarMedia and its outside accounting firm Ernst & Young, and approved by the Starmedia Board of Directors' Audit Committee in 1999 and 2000. In 2011, Espuelas settled the suit \\"without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint\\". At the time of the filing, Espuelas, who cooperated with the SEC investigation over five years, told Adweek magazine: \\"I know that I did nothing wrong....It [the lawsuit] is related to accounting issues at the company. I personally was not involved in accounting at the company. I'm very confident that the company did things right. We had a rather elaborate control function, both internal and external, and to my knowledge that was undertaken correctly.\\" In company announcements made in 2006, StarMedia, now part of France Telecom's Orange subsidiary, the company claimed to be the global leader in Spanish language Internet services. In 2006, the company stated, Starmedia was serving over 22 million unique users a month and continued to expand by launching new services, such as finance and entertainment channels, and opening offices across Latin America. In the Hispanic Business article \\"The Kings of Comebacks\\", Espuelas said, \\"...we [at StarMedia] wanted to redefine history - and I think that... is what happened\\", Mr. Espuelas writes in his 2004 book Life in Action. \\"The StarMedia idea of Pan Latin Americanism, an idea with deep historical roots, was a profound turning point for Latinos across the world.\\" But in the spring of 2000, StarMedia suffered what the book calls \\"the near-complete collapse of the Internet economy.\\" By his own calculation, Mr. Espuelas' StarMedia holdings at one point had a value of nearly $500 million, but he never sold a single share. \\"I lived a full cycle\\", he tells Hispanic Business. \\"It was the best business and personal experience I could have had at this point in my life. \\" \\"What Fernando has been credited with is a vision that may be ahead of his time\\", says Adele Morrissette, a former angel investor in Starmedia and now a managing director at investment bank BMO Capital Markets Corp. of Toronto. \\"People who invested with Fernando early did well if they sold their stock when it went public. It was a good investment for me\\", reported The Deal.

It is the only German-speaking municipality in the canton, where all others are French-speaking. History Ederswiler is first mentioned in 1323 as Ernswilre. The village was part of the parish of Roggenburg, which fell under the control of the Bishop of Basel. Between 1389 and 1454, the parish was handed over as a fiefdom to the Count of Thierstein. Between 1793 and 1815, Ederswiler was part of France and was initially in the d√©partement of Mont-Terrible, but was merged with the d√©partement of Haut-Rhin in 1800. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna established that the municipality would become part of the canton of Bern. In the 1974 Plebiscite of Jura, Ederswiler objected to the creation of the French-speaking canton of Jura. However, the community had no border with the district of Laufen, so unlike all other border communities, it was not able to decide for itself which canton it would belong to. On 1 January 1979, Ederswiler was handed over from Bern to the new canton of Jura. For a long time, it was debated that Ederswiler should be returned to the canton of Bern, while the municipality of Vellerat, which had refused to join Jura for similar reasons, would finally become part of that canton. In 1990, when the population of Laufen voted to transfer to the canton of Basel-Country, Ederswiler was left with no common border with the canton of Bern. Since then, there has been no new discussion regarding Ederswiler switching cantons.  Geography  Ederswiler has an area of .

Biography=Early life and career Born in London, Harrison was the son of the author and jurist Frederic Harrison and his wife Ethel Bertha Harrison. Initially tutored by George Gissing, Harrison attended St Paul's School and Harrow School. After leaving school, he went to Switzerland and Germany to study foreign languages in preparation for the Foreign Office exam, which he subsequently failed. With a career in the civil service now unlikely, Harrison's father used his connections to find his son a position with The Times. Harrison was sent to their Berlin bureau, but he soon ran afoul of their bureau chief and was dismissed. He later found positions with the Manchester Guardian and Reuters, where he enjoyed greater success. Chafing at the restrictions imposed by the German foreign ministry, Harrison resigned from Reuters in 1904 and expressed his concerns about the Kaiser in his first book, The Pan-Germanic Doctrine. Returning to London, he worked briefly as a freelance journalist until he was offered the editorship of The Observer by Lord Northcliffe, the weekly newspaper's new owner. Harrison proved an able editor, using his position to warn his readers of the growing threat posed by the German empire to British security. Yet the paper continued to lose money, prompting Northcliffe to replace Harrison with J. L. Garvin at the end of 1907.Alfred M. Gollin, The Observer and J. L. Garvin, 1908-1914: A Study in a Great Editorship (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), 7-10 Despite his dismissal, Harrison remained with The Observer as literary editor, simultaneously working at the Northcliffe-owned Daily Mail as drama critic. Editorship of The English Review At the end of 1908, Harrison accepted an offer from Alfred Mond to assume the editorship of the newly acquired literary magazine The English Review. Recently started by the author Ford Madox Huffner (later Ford), it had proved critically successful but a business failure. Though his practices irritated some, Harrison soon boosted circulation, which had been at only 1,000 when he assumed the editorship, to 18,000 by 1911. Such was his success that he bought out Mond in 1915, assuming ownership while continuing to serve as editor. During this time he broadened the range of contributors, publishing works by authors as diverse as Anton Chekhov, Hermann Hesse, Katherine Mansfield, Aleister Crowley, Edward Gordon Craig, George Bernard Shaw, and William Butler Yeats. Politics was also a topic addressed in the pages of The English Review, and Harrison continued to warn readers about the threat posed by Germany in the years leading up to The First World War. The death of one of his brothers at the battle of Battle of Festubert turned the Liberal editor into a passionate critic of the government during the subsequent munitions scandal. Harrison also supported a lenient peace with Germany; the harsh terms offered by Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1918 drove Harrison to run against Lloyd George in the prime minister's own borough in the \\"coupon\\" election that December. Final years Harrison helped to found International PEN in 1921. Two years later, he sold The English Review to focus on writing books, though he published occasional journalism as well. Harrison died in 1928 at his home in Sussex from bronchopneumonia.

He appears on all of their albums between White Music (1978) and Mummer (1983). Biography Chambers was born in Swindon, Wiltshire. He originally wanted to learn to play the piano, but his parents could not afford to buy one. So instead he saved money from his Saturday job, stacking shelves at the local grocers, and at the age of 14 bought his first drum kit.Interview in XTC At the Manor, recorded at Richard Branson's Manor Studio on 22, 23 and 24 August 1980 and broadcast on 10 October 1980 by BBC2. Chambers played on XTC's 3D - EP, White Music, Go 2, Drums and Wires, Black Sea, English Settlement, and many live recordings, until his departure from the band during the 1982 sessions for Mummer. On Mummer he played on \\"Beating of Hearts\\", \\"Wonderland\\" and the B-side \\"Toys\\". Chambers' reasons for leaving the band included the band's decision to stop touring and performing live, as well his own plans with his Australian girlfriend, with whom he subsequently migrated to New South Wales. He became involved in session-drumming while living in Australia as well as recording and touring with the band Dragon between late 1983 and mid 1985. He was featured on the Dragon albums Body and the Beat (1984) and the live album and live home video Live One (1985). He is also featured in the promotional video clips for the songs \\"Wilderworld\\", \\"Cry\\", \\"Magic\\" and \\"Rain\\". Chambers married Donna Blanchard since August 1982. They have one son, Kai Chambers, and two daughters, Corie and Abbi-Lee. Kai has followed in his father's footsteps, and has played in Australia and around the world as the drummer for October Rage. Chambers has cited the philosopher Brett Abrahamsen as one of his intellectual heroes. Chambers returned to the UK in 2016 after living in Australia for over 30 years.

Biography Born in Penang, Malaya, Brown was the younger of two sons of Dr. William Carnegie Brown, a specialist in tropical diseases, and his wife Jean Carnegie. At an early age he was sent to Britain, where he attended Suffolk Hall preparatory school and Cheltenham College. After additional private instruction, he was accepted into Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a double first in classical honour moderations and Literae Humaniores. Early career Excelling on the civil service examination, Brown spent two days as a civil servant in the Home Office in 1913 before realising he was unsuited for the job and quit to become a freelance writer. At this time he was involved in left-wing politics, and was a conscientious objector during the First World War. Though he started authoring books at this time, his ability to write quickly and over a wide range of topics soon marked him out for a career in journalism. After writing for The New Age, he received a position in the London office of The Manchester Guardian in 1919.Philip Howard, \\"Brown, Ivor John Carnegie\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 8, p. 54. =Drama criticism= Though his contributions ranged over a number of subjects, Brown developed a particular interest in the theatre. He became a drama critic for the Saturday Review in 1923 and was named the Shute lecturer in the art of the theatre at Liverpool University three years later. In 1929, Brown joined The Observer as their drama critic. In the decade that followed, he emerged as the most influential and insightful drama critic in the British press, a status acknowledged in 1939 with his appointment as professor of drama in the Royal Society of Literature and his selection as director of drama for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts the following year. =Attacks on modernist poetry= Brown made quite a show of his unwillingness to follow fashionable literary and cultural nostrums. Some of his best writings are beautifully crafted and often hilarious polemics on modern poetry, music and manners. This can be seen (sometimes with a startling effect on today's reader) in such works as I Commit to the Flames, in which, for example, he is particularly scathing about Eliot and Pound: > Mr T. S. Eliot offers the public the balderdash of his Waste-Land > (pretentious bungling with the English language) and immediately becomes a > pundit, bestriding the Atlantic with his cultural messages....our immunity > from such poetry continually weakens; it has now been discovered that half- > baked intellectuals will worship baby-talk and even persuade other people to > pay for it....Gibberish levels all minds....Hence the popularity of modern > verse....the source of the trouble is a general flight from reason....belief > in the omnipotence of the sub-conscious for faith in self-determination of > the will by reason guided. And again: > ....the Prophet Ezra at large among the alphabet, his Ps and Qs in a fine > frenzy rolling....Mr. Pound 'uses quotations and translations and > reminiscence and single words which are often meant to convey a large burden > outside themselves' [here quoting Grigson]. This is one of T. S. Eliot's > antics, as readers of The Waste-land have somewhat painfully > discovered....Why, too, should he [the reader] grub about The Waste-land to > root up the dubious truffles of Mr. Eliot's scholarship? =Writings on Shakespeare= Brown had a particular interest in Shakespeare, publishing several books about his life and career, and one on the poet's love life. He also wrote a play about Shakespeare's lost love Anne Whateley in 1937, published in 1947, and broadcast on the BBC in 1953, starring Irene Worth as Anne and John Gregson as Shakespeare.Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, English, Summer 1953; 9: 179 ‚Äì 18 =Linguistics Observations= Brown showed an interest in grammar and the use of words from his earliest writings. His 1920s essay \\"Winning Out\\", published in The Saturday Review, lightly criticizes an observed trend coming from America to adorn verbs with prepositions. Brown went on to write an immensely popular series of fifteen books on the subject of how words are used and called attention to unusual features of language use with humor and charm. Editorship of The Observer In February 1942, J. L. Garvin, was forced out after 34 years as editor of The Observer because of a political dispute with the paper's owner, Waldorf Astor. After a succession of temporary editors, Brown was named as Garvin's successor in August. The paper at the time was undergoing considerable changes spearheaded by Waldorf's son, David Astor, with the introduction of new writers, many of them talented √©migr√©s from the Continent, and an ideological shift from an independent conservative stance to a far more liberal one. Brown's appointment was widely viewed as short-term, with Astor waiting in the wings to succeed him and already performing as many of the duties as editor as his war service permitted. Though uncomfortable with many of the new writers (possibly because of his growing political conservatism) Brown left the political side of The Observer to Astor and the paper's assistant editor, Donald Tyerman, and concentrated on the paper's coverage of cultural matters. Brown served as editor until David Astor officially succeeded him in 1948, after which he continued as The Observer's drama critic until he was replaced by Kenneth Tynan in 1954.Richard Cockett, David Astor and The Observer (London: Andre Deutsch, 1991), 102‚Äì104, 171. Final years Brown spent his final years concentrating on writing books. He would eventually publish over 75 books covering a wide range of topics and genres, but he was best known for his works on literature and the English language. He was chairman of the British Drama League from 1954 to 1962 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and he was named a CBE in 1957. He died in London in 1974.

It is also located directly to the south of Stowmarket, with a half-mile (800m) of glacial valley known locally as 'Slough'. History There are several interesting historic buildings including the old village school, the tannery, and the former model farm that has now been developed as dwellings. Combs Post Office is now a private dwelling but the original postbox is still there the building is Grade 2 listed. According to White's History, Gazetteer and Directory of Suffolk published in 1885 the village had 1,174 inhabitants at the 1881 census, although this does include Combs Ford, which nowadays is regarded as being a suburb of Stowmarket. White's also notes that at that time the Combs Tannery was owned by Messrs. Webb and Sons and carried on the tanning of leather and manufacture of glove and gaiter leather, leather machine bands and leather hose. At that time in 1885 the Tannery employed 150 persons. It also states that an artesian well had been sunk on the site at a depth of and a diameter of ten inches (254 mm) at the surface. Many interesting geological specimens were extracted and deposited in Ipswich Museum. The village was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi Churches= Combs Chapel  The following is from the United Reformed Churches website: :Combs was a rural backwater where Dissenters met hiding from the authorities. A house church was established there in 1696. In 1719, the people of Combs helped to form the Independent Chapel, Stowmarket. :Combs Chapel was one of seven causes under the direction of the Independent Chapel, Stowmarket with a common membership, Deacons‚Äô (then Elders‚Äô) and Church Meetings. It was an extremely effective way of ministering to people living in five hundred square miles of Suffolk. The chapel was built after folk had been meeting in a local barn since 1862. The big and grand occasions were held in Stowmarket. :The original chapel was replaced with a prefabricated building in 1969, and when that began to deteriorate, with most people journeying the two miles (3 km) to Stowmarket United Reformed Church, it was decided to cease having a separate building within the village. :A Service of Thanksgiving for its Life and Witness was held on Sunday, 11 October 1992. Non-conformist church life continues in the village somewhat as it did in 1686 ‚Äì in people‚Äôs homes, with a monthly coffee morning and an occasional service and event. The former congregation, with others from the village, fully participates in the life of the Stowmarket town church.  St Mary's Parish Church, Combs  The Church of St Mary is an ancient structure, consisting of a nave, chancel, aisles, and a square tower, in which are four bells. =1086= The Domesday Survey mentions the existence of 'one church at Combas'. No evidence of this building remains but it shows that there has been a church here, and almost certainly on this spot, for maybe 1000 years. =1300‚Äì1345= From c.1300 to 1345 the core of much of the present church took shape. The west window of the south aisle dates from c.1300. The much restored chancel arch is of a similar date. The north and south doorways are early 14th century, also the bold arches in the base of the tower suggest that it was begun about this time. Above these arches are carved the engrailed cross of the de Uffords, who were Lords of the Manor here from 1216 ‚Äì 1381. Around 1330, or just after, the chancel took shape. =Fifteenth century= The 15th century. There was a great period of church building in Suffolk and here at Combs the nave, aisles and tower assumed their present appearance. The nave was heightened and received a new shallow-pitched roof. Its walls were pierced with elegant clerestory windows. The north and south aisles were altered and possibly extended. They were given their three- light perpendicular windows. The tower was also completed and received its belfry windows and parapet. =1500= The South porch was built of Tudor brick, although it received a new entrance arch in the 18th century. =Seventeenth century= Before the Reformation, the interior must have been a kaleidoscope of colour and carving, providing a host of visual aids to teach the faith to ordinary people who could not read and were not Latin scholars. In the mid 16th century much of this was removed by the reformers. The Puritans in 1640s destroyed a great deal more in their zeal to rid our churches of 'superstitious images and inscriptions'. =Nineteenth century= 1851 The Census of Places of Worship taken this year records that the population of the parish was 1,148. On the census Sunday the morning congregation was 48+49 scholars whilst the afternoon congregation numbered 187+48 scholars. Holy Communion was celebrated four times a year with an average of 34 communicants. 1871 An explosion at the guncotton works at Stowmarket blew out much of the church's 15th century glass.Combs, retrieved 18 October 2009. 1885‚Äì1886 The church underwent a very thorough restoration to the designs of Herbert J Green of Norwich. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Monuments was consulted and the work was carried out very sensitively. The church was closed for 12 months, when services were held in the Board School or in a large marquee in the churchyard during summer months. The reopening service took place on 16 June 1886. The preacher in the morning service was Canon Samuel Garrett, vicar of St Margaret's Ipswich and the preacher in the evening service was Rev J C Girling, Rector of Coltishall, Norfolk. =Twentieth century= Much has been done over the past 100 years to keep this church intact. In 1943 the large candlesticks were given for use in the sanctuary and the two commandment panels were moved from the sanctuary niches to their present position at the west end of the church. In 1952, the 15th century glass now in the south-east windows of the south aisle finally came back to Combs. A good amount of stained glass at St Mary's survived both the destruction of the Reformers and also the explosion at Stowmarket gun- cotton works in 1871. The hundreds of assorted fragments were stored in two wooden boxes in the church. The Archdeacon of Suffolk had them deposited in the Victoria and Albert Museum, where they were seen in 1939 by Miss Joan Howson, a stained glass expert from Putney, who offered to reassemble the fragments free of charge. This was delayed by the war years, when the glass was hidden away for safety in a mine at Portmadoc, North Wales and also delayed by a commission for Miss Howson to repair damaged windows at Westminster Abbey. The work was completed in 1952 and the glass was replaced in the two south aisle windows. St Mary's Church Combs. Retrieved 7 February 2014. In 1963 the present organ was installed by William Boggis of Diss. In 1995, through the generosity of Mr Clifford Cook, the western sections of the aisles were transformed by the building of a kitchen and toilet facilities on the north side and a vestry and meeting room on the south.

Its main competitors are ESPN and beIN Sports, both available as part of a Foxtel or Kayo Sports subscription. Fox Sports in Australia differs from other Fox Sports-branded channels in the United States and elsewhere around the world in those are not owned by Fox Corporation and The Walt Disney Company respectively, but by Foxtel. Both the U.S and Australian companies nonetheless remain under the control of the Murdoch family, as Foxtel is majority-owned by the Murdoch-controlled News Corp Australia.  History  Fox Sports started life as the Premier Sports Network (later just 'Premier Sports') as the only fully operational local channel at the launch of Australia's first pay-television service, Galaxy. Premier Sports' backers included American company Prime International, which later became part of Liberty Media. The service was launched at 16:00 on 26 January 1995 in Sydney, and made a name for itself, securing the rights to Australia's cricket tour of the West Indies. Previously Australian cricket tours had been covered on the Nine Network on free-to-air, and Nine tried to stop the broadcast under Australia's 'anti-siphoning' rules, which state that certain popular sporting events cannot be screened exclusively on pay television. PSN signed a deal with Network Ten to share the broadcast rights. When Foxtel launched its cable service later that year, PSN was included as part of the package. Between 1995 and 2010, Fox Sports aired National Basketball League (NBL) games. On 1 March 1996, PSN was relaunched as Fox Sports Australia, to coincide with the new Super 12 rugby union competition and the proposed launch of the Super League. In 1997 a secondary channel was launched on Foxtel to carry broadcasts of the new Super League competition. Fox Sports and its chief competitor, Sports Australia shared the rights to NRL broadcasts as a result of the legal settlement in the Super League war. The channel on Foxtel was later relaunched as Fox Sports Two, at first broadcasting from Friday through Monday each week, and later expanding to a full 24-hour, 7-day service in 2002. When Optus Vision dropped the C7 Sport service in March 2002, they started carrying the Fox Sports channels. These were referred to by Optus as \\"Optus Sports 1\\" and \\"Optus Sports 2\\" in Optus promotional material; on-air programming referred to the channels as simply \\"Sports One\\" and \\"Sports Two\\", although programming such as the nightly Fox Sports News bulletins retained the Fox name. Optus dropped the \\"Optus Sports\\" name in October 2002. Fox Sports Two was generally used to cover bigger events that require large amounts of air time, such as the 1998 Winter Olympics, Grand Slam tennis tournaments, and the 2004 European Football Championship. It now specialises as a 24/7, dedicated Rugby League channel, Fox League. During the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Fox Sports carried an additional eight channels dedicated to Games events. These were available to customers at an additional charge. Fox Sports has been the exclusive broadcaster of the Hyundai A-League since its first season in 2005. In 2006, an A$120 million deal between the FFA and Fox Sports was reached after the end of the first season. Under the deal, Fox Sports will have exclusive rights from 2007 to all Socceroos home internationals, all A-League and Asian Cup fixtures, World Cup qualifiers through the AFC, and all AFC Champions League matches. The deal to cover the A-league live and exclusive has reaped big rewards for Fox Sports, its ratings were very strong in the 2006-07 season and the 2007 A-league grand final became at the time, Fox Sports' highest ever rating event. Ratings for football have generally been very good. The Socceroos first game of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, attracted 345,000 viewers, while their Quarter final drew an average of 419,000 \\\\- at the time, an all-time record for Australian Pay TV. This record was broken on 1 April 2009, when the Socceroos defeated Uzbekistan to put them very close to qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This match was watched by an average of 431,000 people. In 2007, Fox Sports reached a deal to broadcast 4 games live and exclusive from the AFL each week. This includes the exclusive only Sunday twilight match. In addition they will broadcast Friday night games live into New South Wales and Queensland via channel 518 at no extra charge - normally used for pay-per-view service Main Event. When channel 518 a is used in this way it is promoted as Fox Sports Plus on-air. The channel is being used increasingly to show live events when Fox Sports has a clash involving its main 3 channels. On Saturday 17 March 2007, for example, Fox Sports broadcast a match from the 2007 Cricket World Cup (Ireland v Pakistan) live on 518, as it was committed to football, rugby union and another cricket match on its main 3 channels. In 2010 Fox Sports coverage of National Rugby League games held 73 out of the top 100 programs of any type aired on Foxtel. In February 2012, the Premier Media Group changed its name to Fox Sports Pty Limited. On 5 March 2013, Fox Sports unveiled its new headquarters at Artarmon, New South Wales. It was announced that the main studio would be named the Clive Churchill Studio after the NRL immortal Clive Churchill, as the studio will house NRL coverage. Technical innovations were the main highlight, with CEO Patrick Delany unveiling the FoxKopter, the FoxMobile Segway, Ref Cam and Cornerpost Cam. Fox Sports also launched a new corporate logo in line with its global affiliate broadcasters. On 3 September 2014, Fox Sports announced that SPEED and Fuel TV would be rebranded as FOX Sports 4 and FOX Sports 5 on 3 November 2014, of which both will be available in HD. In addition, it was announced that FOX Sports News would launch a HD feed on the same day, taking FOX Sports' suite to 7 channels, all available in HD. On 23 February 2017, Fox Sports More, a new channel for live, pop-up events was launched. In 2018, as well as launching a second new channel in a row (Fox Sports Mix), Fox Sports Pty Ltd was merged with Foxtel. Corporate history Fox Sports Australia Pty Limited (formerly Premier Media Group Pty Limited) is a subsidiary of Foxtel that owns sports-related television networks and digital properties. It owns Australian subscription TV channels Fox Sports, Fox Sports News and Fox Footy and a range of video, text and statistical content for television, mobile phone and online delivery. It operates the Watch AFL and Watch NRL subscription streaming services which show Australian sports content to global audiences. In February 2012, Premier Media Group changed its name to Fox Sports, with CEO Patrick Delany explaining \\"The change from Premier Media to Fox Sports provides a stronger reflection of the core business of the company in its name, which is, and will continue to be, sport.\\" On 2 November 2012, News Corp. took control of Consolidated Media Holdings after a $2 billion merger was approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Federal Court and Consolidated Media Holding shareholders, making News Corp. 100% owner of Fox Sports Pty Ltd. In April 2018 News Corp Australia moved the ownership of the company to one of its subsidiaries Foxtel a joint venture with Telstra.

The first series aired in the UK on Channel 5 from 27 April 2006. It began airing in the United States on 22 March 2006 on Oxygen and in Germany on Comedy Central in 2007. The second series began on Channel 5 on 6 September 2007. Premise Joyce Hazeldine and her policeman husband Jeremy move to what seems to be an idyllic home counties town of Little Stempington from London. She soon discovers there are two rival gangs of housewives, one headed by Camilla Diamond and one by Barbara Du Prez. Once very good friends, Camilla and Barbara originally turned to weaponry and intimidation as a way of dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour, and gathered a small group of local women to help further their cause, but the group splintered into two smaller gangs when Camilla grew greedy and used their increased clout for her own personal gain, dealing in extortion, racketeering, coercion and threats to local businesses and residents of the town. Barbara's gang continues to take extreme action against perceived 'threats to Little Stempington life' (planned low- cost housing, teenagers wearing hoodies, etc.), while also working tirelessly against Camilla's gang. Timid Joyce, unfortunately, becomes a pawn in both gangs, enlisted by Barbara to work undercover as a way of getting closer to Camilla. The plot later thickens with Camilla racketeering the local recreational drugs market with 8 times strength HRT patches from their contacts in Marseille (hence the twinning with Marseille in the town sign). Cast * Amelia Bullmore as Joyce Hazeldine, the na√Øve newcomer to Little Stempington who on moving to the village is gobsmacked to discover that her well-dressed, well-mannered neighbours are in fact a female mafia. She is of a nervous disposition and frequently attempts to solve disputes by talking them over - not that this method ever gets her anywhere. She works for both Barbara and Camilla during the course of the series, but her true alliance is with the 'good' gang, and during series two she becomes their leader. Throughout the series she battles to keep her excursions into the murky underworld of Little Stempington a secret from her loving husband Jeremy. * Anna Chancellor as Camilla Diamond, head of the 'bad' gang. Originally very good friends with Barbara du Prez, the two formed an all-female mafia system after accidentally killing a burglar. They used it to keep Little Stempington free of crime, but Camilla saw what the crime could do for her own gain, and the two soon parted ways. She constantly masterminds a variety of schemes to make herself very rich, such as running a male prostitution ring and introducing a female fight club to Little Stempington. * Felicity Montagu as Barbara du Prez, head of the 'good' gang. Despite being 'good' she employs extreme and often violent methods in order to prevent the bad gang from gaining a stronghold of the town. She is an optimist who takes great pride in her status as a vigilante. * Rachael Blake as Hilary Davenport, one of Camilla's sidekicks. Hilary is an archetypal cougar, preying on a number of younger men throughout the series. When the bad gang initiate a male prostitution ring, Hilary takes it upon herself to give each of the men a thorough suitability check. * Cathryn Bradshaw as Margaret Littlefair, a sidekick of Barbara du Prez and the 'good' counterpart to Lillian. A remarkably ditzy woman who seems to know a lot about making explosives and handling guns, it is hinted that Margaret lost her virginity on a table tennis table and has not had sex in an extremely long time, hence her eager trigger finger. * Lucy Robinson as Pam Draper, a sidekick of Barbara du Prez and the 'good' counterpart to Hilary, although Pam is in fact rather violent and always relishes the opportunity to discipline the unruly youths of Little Stempington. She is particularly posh and is always seen in a clean and pressed suit. She has very little actual compassion for the people she combats, even threatening to castrate a man if he didn't start speaking 'the Queen's English'. * Emma Kennedy as Lillian Gordon-Moore, one of Camilla's sidekicks. Lillian has more than a passing passion for firearms, and can handle virtually any weapon you put in her hands. Usually dressed in trousers, jodhpurs or similar lady of the manor-style attire. Although not necessarily a lesbian, she is rather taken by Joyce and even saves her life at one point. * Ralph Ineson as Jeremy Hazeldine, Joyce's husband and the new local superintendent. After moving from the city he finds the job in Little Stempington suspiciously easy, what with the fact that no actual crime has been reported there in many years. At one point he suspects Joyce is having an affair with a French drug baron friend of Camilla's, but he enjoys life in Little Stempington and has no idea that the housewives are anything less than saintly, even after he is drugged by Camilla. * Tom Ellis as PC Haines, Jeremy's colleague in the force, and apparently the only police officer in Little Stempington. Haines has a habit of stating the obvious and frequently baffles Jeremy with his mind-numbingly boring observations as they sit on patrol in the hope that a crime may occur. * Ruth Wilson as Jewel Diamond, Camilla's teenage daughter with a rampant sexual appetite and eyes only for Joyce's son Bill. She has little in the way of self-awareness and seemingly no idea that Bill is terrified of her advances. As an aspiring actor (albeit one who cannot act), Jewel is melodramatic in the extreme, and at one point threatens to throw herself from the church roof unless Bill marries her. * Tom Hiddleston as Bill Hazeldine, Joyce and Jeremy's completely naive son. After coming back from missionary work in Africa, he becomes friends with Jewel Diamond, though he does not know how to handle her sexual advances. * Andrew Scarborough as Stuart Diamond, Camilla Diamond's hapless and oblivious husband who gets into slapstick situations with Barbra Du Prez's equally hapless husband. * Vincenzo Nicoli as Emile Lesoux Production *The Little Stempington town sign was only seen in the first four episodes in season one, because the writer, Roger Beckett, stole it from the set. It is currently under his bed in his house. *Most of the filming was done in Pinner, London. American remakes In 2008, HBO commissioned a pilot episode of a U.S. version of \\"Suburban Shootout\\". The script was written by Michelle Ashford, the episode directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and filmed in the Hamptons, Long Island, NY in September 2008. The cast included Kelly Preston as Camilla Diamond, Judy Greer, Mary Birdsong, Kerri Kenney-Silver, and Rachael Harris The pilot was not picked up to series and never aired. ABC have commissioned a separate pilot script, also an adaptation of the UK series, this time written by Byron Balasco in the format of a one-hour comedy-drama series. It remains to be seen if the script will be sent to pilot.

(... does not play dice) is a board game, designed by Ingo Alth√∂fer, a professor of applied mathematics in Jena, Germany. It was the official game of an exhibition about Einstein in Germany during the Einstein Year (2005). The name of the game in German has a double meaning. It is a play on Einstein's famous quote \\"I am convinced that He (God) does not play dice\\" and also refers to the fact that when a player has only one cube (ein Stein) remaining, they no longer need to \\"play dice\\", and may simply move the cube. Rules The starting board The game is played on a square board with a 5√ó5 grid. Each player has six cubes, numbered one to six. During setup, each player can arrange the cubes as he or she sees fit within the triangular area of their own color. The players take turns rolling a six-sided die and then moving the matching cube. If the matching cube is no longer on the board, the player moves a remaining cube whose number is next- higher or next-lower to the rolled number. The player starting in the top-left may move that cube one square to the right, down, or on the diagonal down and to the right; the player starting in the bottom-right may move that cube one square to the left, up, or on the diagonal up and to the left. Any cube which already lies in the target square is removed from the board. The objective of the game is for a player to either get one of their cubes to the far corner square in the grid (where their opponent started) or to remove all of their opponent's cubes from the board. Strategy The fewer cubes a player has, the \\"more mobile\\" those cubes are, since more die rolls can result in moving the same piece. Therefore, it can be helpful to aim to remove one's own cubes in order to be able to move them with a higher individual probability than having multiple cubes remaining. Schwarz tables The \\"mobility\\" of pieces given the removal of one or more pieces can be quantified with probability. The Schwarz score of a set of pieces on the board is defined as the expected number of remaining moves, assuming no capturing takes place, for one of the pieces to reach its goal. In general, players should minimize the Schwarz score of their pieces and maximize the Schwarz score of their opponent's pieces. As there are six pieces, and each piece can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 moves away from their goal, or out of play, there are 15,625 distinct situations in which Schwarz scores can be precomputed. Variants The game can also be played on a 6 √ó 6 board with ten pieces on each side, labeled 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. A pair of 6-sided dice are rolled. The game can also be played in rounds with a doubling cube as in backgammon.

He is also one of the Hulk's enemies. Fictional character biography Dr. Geoffrey Crawford was a physics professor at Desert State University who took undergraduate Bruce Banner under his wing and became his mentor. Years later, Banner went to his teacher for aid in finding a cure for the Hulk. At this time Crawford was a sick man, but he was nevertheless able to create a machine that could be used to filter the gamma radiation from Bruce's body. Crawford also saw this as a way to cure himself. By obtaining some of the Hulk's DNA, he knew he would be able to use the Hulk's recuperative powers on himself. First, Crawford reconfigured his own DNA so that it was a match with Banner's. This turned him into a stronger beast than the Hulk: the monster called Ravage.Rampaging Hulk Vol. 2 #2 Ravage is stronger than the Hulk and is slightly larger. The key element which makes Ravage such a dangerous enemy is that he still has Dr. Crawford's mind and a lust for power. Just after his first transformation, Ravage attacks Hulk, but he soon returns to being Crawford at sunrise, much like Banner initially transformed into the Hulk at sunset and returned to being Banner at sunrise. Crawford turns Banner over to General Ross for fear of being stopped from becoming Ravage again.Rampaging Hulk Vol. 2 #3 Crawford adjusts his machine so that it will change him into Ravage permanently. He then attacks the university as Ravage and terrorizes those who had pitied him as Dr. Crawford. Ravage is only stopped when the Hulk and General Ross formed an unlikely alliance that allows the army to trap the villain in a state of suspended animation.Rampaging Hulk Vol. 2 #4 Powers and abilities Ravage possesses superhuman strength and durability while maintaining Crawford's intellect and hunger for power. He is bigger and slightly stronger than the Hulk, with the ability to leap great distances, and Ravage also acquired the amazing healing and regenerative powers as well as immunity to all known diseases from Banner.http://marvel.com/universe/Ravage_%28Geoffrey_Crawford%29#axzz4vTepqt5p Other versions=Ultimate Marvel * In the Ultimate Marvel universe, although Ravage/Dr. Geoffrey Crawford has never appeared, there are some links of him in other Hulk related characters. The character of Tyrone Cash, a vicious mobster with Hulk abilities is portrayed as a former mentor of Bruce Banner, and once was a frail scientist, Dr. Leonard Williams with MS,Ultimate Avengers vol. 2 #1 (much like Crawford) and the Ultimate Dr. Samuel Sterns is a bitter, old, wheelchair-using man who became a Hulk-like monster.Ultimate Mystery #4 In other media=Video games * Dr. Geoffrey Crawford/Ravage appears in the 2003 video game adaptation of the 2003 Hulk feature film, voiced by Paul Dobson. Geoffrey Crawford initially appears as Bruce Banner's old mentor. In the game, he finds a cure for the Hulk by using the gamma orb, which draws out the gamma energy that created the Hulk. Then when he discovers the military plans to use it to defeat the Hulk. Crawford tells Banner to get to his lab before the military does. This version of Crawford is similar to the original comic book version in that he needs to use a wheelchair for mobility, but he attempts to regain his health to walk again. However, after Bruce Banner arrives in the lab, it is revealed that Crawford is just using him to get gamma radiation for himself, using it to become Ravage. Over the course of the game, it is revealed that Crawford is working with the Leader, who seeks to use the gamma energy from the orb to create an army of gamma warriors. During his boss fight, Ravage battles the Hulk alone at first until he summons two armed gamma creatures to assist him. After being defeated by the Hulk, he reverts to his human form and apologizes for his actions, realizing that his treachery has given the Leader all he needs to create an army. At the end of the game, Crawford is seen apparently trying to get more gamma radiation to become Ravage again, by building a copy of the gamma orb after the original was destroyed by the Hulk. However, it doesn't work and fails on him. * Ravage appears as an unlockable playable character in Lego Marvel's Avengers.

In it, after the huge Hammerklavier Sonata, Op. 106, Beethoven returns to a smaller scale and a more intimate character. It is dedicated to Maximiliane Brentano, the daughter of Beethoven's long-standing friend Antonie Brentano, for whom Beethoven had already composed the short Piano Trio in B major WoO 39 in 1812. Musically, the work is characterised by a free and original approach to the traditional sonata form. Its focus is the third movement, a set of variations that interpret its theme in a wide variety of individual ways.  History  Beethoven's studio (Johann Nepomuk Hoechle, 1827) Work on Op. 109 can be traced back to early in 1820, even before Beethoven's negotiations with Adolf Schlesinger, the publisher of his last three sonatas. Recent research suggests that Friedrich Starke had asked Beethoven for a composition for his piano anthology The Vienna Pianoforte School, and that Beethoven had interrupted work on the Missa Solemnis. In the end, though, he offered Starke numbers 7‚Äì11 of the Bagatelles, Op. 119.  Genesis  There is an April entry in Beethoven's conversation book describing a \\"small new piece\\" that is, according to William Meredith, identical to the first movement of Op. 109. In fact, the outline of the movement makes the idea of a Bagatelle interrupted by fantasia-like interludes seem very plausible. Beethoven's secretary Franz Oliva then allegedly suggested the idea of using this \\"small piece\\" as the beginning of the sonata that Schlesinger wanted.Barry Cooper: Beethoven. pp. 279‚Äì280. Cited by www.raptusassociation.org Sieghard Brandenburg has put forward the theory that Beethoven had originally planned a two-movement sonata, omitting the first movement. Apparently some of the motivic characteristics that link the first movement with the others were only introduced later.Sieghard Brandenburg: Die Skizzen zur neunten Symphonie, p. 105. Alexander Wheelock Thayer, on the other hand, put forward the view that the beginning of a sonata in E minor by Beethoven was not developed further and had nothing to do with Op. 109.Alexander Wheelock Thayer, cited in www.raptusassociation.org Manuscript of Op. 109 (start of the first movement) For the third movement, Beethoven first sketched a set of about six variations, then a set of nine, and finally a continuity draft for a set of six. See especially pp. 210‚Äì211. The differences in character between the individual variations seem to be smaller in the nine-variation version than in the final printed edition, but according to Kay Dreyfus this already indicates a \\"process of exploration and re-discovery of the theme\\".  Publication  It has not been conclusively established whether Beethoven completed the sonata in the autumn of 1820 or only in 1821. In letters to his publisher in 1820, he was already speaking of \\"Fertigstellung\\" (completion); but it is unclear whether Beethoven meant completed concepts, drafts or a fair copy that could be dispatched. The first edition was published by Schlesinger in Berlin in November 1821. It contained many errors, since Beethoven was prevented by illness from undertaking adequate proof-reading. The sonata is dedicated to Maximiliane Brentano, the musically gifted daughter of Franz and Antonie Brentano.  First performances  The date of the first performance is unknown. The first pianists to undertake to bring Beethoven's last sonatas, including Op. 109, to public attention were Franz Liszt, who regularly included them in his programs between 1830 and 1840, and Hans von B√ºlow, who even included several of the late sonatas in one evening.  General considerations  With regard to Beethoven's late work, and especially to his late piano sonatas, Op. 109 is particularly noteworthy for its divergence from the norms of sonata form and for its harmonic and structural innovations.  Beethoven's last sonatas  Opus 109 is one of Beethoven's last three, five or six sonatas that are counted among his late works. The different cut-off points arise from the fact that the sonatas from Opus 90 on are varied and contradictory in form and in their predominant musical tendencies. The pianistic means are reduced to leaner, chamber music-like voice leading, as in the first movement of Opus 110, or dissolved into recitative-like passages, as in the third movement of the same work. These procedures contrast with a heightened virtuosity, a broadening of the form and an increase in overall length, as for example in the Hammerklavier sonata, Op. 106.Zilkens, op. cit. pp. 128, 130, 230 In Op. 109, reminiscences of the straightforward style of the early, Haydn-influenced sonatas contrast with harmony that is sometimes harsh, anticipating the music of the 20th century. This gives special importance to the principles of polyphonic variation, as in the second movement of Op. 109, and consequently the use of baroque forms, especially fugue and fugato. Very wide intervals between the outer voices, a process of breaking the music into ever shorter note values (as in the sixth variation in Op. 109), use of trills to resolve the music into layers of sound (the same variation in Op. 109 and again in Op. 111), arpeggios, ostinati and tremolos gain increased significance.  General characteristics  This sonata seduces the listener with its intimate, less dramatic character and distinguishes itself by its special lyricism, \\"melodic and harmonic beauties\\" and ornaments and arabesques hinting at Chopin. In this sonata, as in many of Beethoven's late works, one interval is significant throughout. Here it is the interval of a third. It shares with other late Beethoven sonatas the shift of focus to the last movement, the dissolution into \\"pure sound\\" and the references to old baroque forms. Some similarities to the opening of the Sonata in A, Op.101 have been noted.  Key  Throughout the history of music there has been much philosophy and speculation about the character of the individual keys. In Beethoven, E major (frequently described as bright and radiant) and E minor (sad, lamenting) often appear together, as in Op. 14 No. 1, the second Razumovsky quartet and Op. 90. The combination has been said to mitigate both the light and the dark aspects of the music.  Differences from the standard model  Opus 109 differs from the \\"standard model\\" in several ways. Although written in three movements, it feels more like \\"two balanced movements\\", since the first movement is linked to the scherzo-like Prestissimo by holding down the pedal. The internal form of the first movement is based less on elaboration than on the contrasting juxtaposition of fast and slow, loud and soft, and major and minor. Hence the second movement takes on even more of the function usually assigned to the first movement, which would be in sonata-allegro form. Then the third movement is ‚Äì most unusually for a sonata ‚Äì a theme and variations. Thus the theme in the third movement takes on the role of the slow movement, which is usually the second movement in the standard model. Although the sonata is formally in three movements, many leading musiciansArnold Werner- Jensen: Reclams Musikf√ºhrer Ludwig van Beethoven, Reclam, 1998, p. 92. and recordings make it sound like two movements by going into the second movement without a pause and then clearly separating the third movement. However, musicologists J√ºrgen Uhde, , and Carl Dahlhaus divide the work into three movements in their detailed analyses.  Analysis  The three movements of this sonata are: A performance lasts about twenty minutes, of which the third movement takes more than half. Overall, the sonata is endowed with abundant melody and interesting, complex harmony.  First movement  : \\\\version \\"2.14.1\\" \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\mark \\" Vivace. ma non troppo.

The same tendency is manifest in the Missa Solemnis, composed at almost the same time, and in the piano sonatas following this one. A quiet, lyrical, rapid Vivace first theme is contrasted, after only eight bars, with a forte and Adagio second theme full of arpeggios. Even from a purely harmonic point of view, the contrast between the clear major in the first part and the extremely tense diminished seventh chords in the second could hardly be more obvious. Bar 8 does not complete the cadence in the dominant (B major) that was conventional when progressing to the second subject in sonata-allegro form. Bars 9‚Äì15 continue to avoid the cadence, which only appears in bar 15. Charles Rosen and others analyse the first movement as being in sonata form, in which the two opening sections form the first and second subjects, and bars 66 to the end as a coda. Richard Rosenberg confirms the three-part structure of sonata form, but cannot identify any thematic duality within the exposition. Rather, he sees a correspondence between the upper voices of the Vivace and the Adagio together with the bass of the Vivace on the one hand (E‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìG‚ÄìB‚ÄìE) and the middle voice in the left hand of the Adagio on the other (D‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìG‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìE). J√ºrgen Uhde and Richard Rosenberg point out a similarity between the opening theme of the present sonata and that of the Vivace movement of the Sonata in G major, Op. 79.

This movement is also in sonata form, although the usual contrast between the first subject (E minor) and the second subject (B minor) is completely absent here because of the nature of the thematic material.Alfred Brendel: Der sp√§te Stil.

The dotted notes emphasise the second beat of the bar, giving this song-like theme something of the character of a Sarabande.Hugo Riemann, cited in Richard Rosenberg: op. cit. pp. 408‚Äì409 Its \\"dignified, meditative feel is strengthened by emphasis on the tonic E\\", which is reached through the falling third in bars 1 and 3, and later through other, wider intervals such as the falling fifth in bar 5 and the rising minor sixth in bar 7. Bars 1‚Äì2 are present in various shapes throughout the first eight bars. Bars 1‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì6 are based on a common thematic shape: G‚ÄìE‚ÄìD‚ÄìB; bars 3‚Äì4 and 7‚Äì8 are based similarly on G‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìA‚ÄìB. = Variation 1 = This variation keeps the tempo of the theme. Compared with the quartet-like theme, it is more pianistic. The melody is an octave higher, thereby becoming more emotional. It is formed like a \\"ceremonial waltz\\". With its accompanying formulae in the left hand, its ornamentation and its nuanced dynamics, it calls to mind many later compositions, such as bars 16‚Äì20 of Chopin's Waltz in A minor Op. 34, No. 2. or Debussy's Prelude Danseuses de Delphe. = Variation 2 = This variation is marked leggiermente. Whereas the theme and first variation were a binary phrase structure, here we have three variations collated and presented as one. The first texture is a call and response which strongly recalls the beginning of the first movement. The second is a two-voice canon in the right hand over a steady quaver accompaniment. The two textures are then combined to form a third, with alternating semiquavers between the left and right hands as in the beginning, with a steady quaver chordal pulse as in the second part. This pattern is then repeated for the second half of the theme. = Variation 3 (Allegro vivace) = This variation breaks away from the original tempo and is marked Allegro vivace. It replaces the theme's time signature with . It is a virtuosic Allegro in a two-part contrapuntal texture reminiscent of a two- part invention. This is the only variation in this movement to end on forte. = Variation 4 = This variation is a little slower than the theme (\\"Etwas langsamer, als das thema. Un poco meno andante ci√≤ √® un poco pi√π adagio come il tema.\\"). It is in time. The first half (repeated) is a contrapuntal texture varying between two and four voices. In the second half, between zero and two voices continue in the same vein over an accompaniment of broken chords. = Variation 5 (Allegro ma non troppo) = After variation 4, Beethoven abandons numbering the variations and just provides tempo indications at the head of the remaining ones. The reasons are unknown. In spite of this, it is usual to refer to the remaining variations as numbers 5 and 6. According to Udo Zilkens, the driving rhythmic energy of the fifth variation gives the impression, at least to begin with, of a complex, many-voiced chorale-like fugue. The Schenker edition gives three different bar numberings for this variation, two of which imply the omission of some of the bars. Neither preface identifies the sources leading to these numberings.Heinrich Schenker (ed.) translated with new preface by Carl Schachter (1975): Ludwig van Beethoven: Complete Piano Sonatas, vol. 2, Dover Publications Inc., New York, , pp. 570‚Äì571 = Variation 6 (Tempo primo del tema) = In extreme contrast to the energy and speed of the previous variation, this one begins with a four-bar passage marked cantabile, in quiet, slow crotchets at the tempo of the theme. Its peaceful, static character is emphasised by the repeated B in the top voice. As the sonata progresses to its conclusion, Beethoven intensifies almost every musical parameter to the maximum. Note values intensify the rhythm by decreasing from crotchets through quavers, triplet quavers and semiquavers to demisemiquavers. Contrast of register is increased by alternating very prominent high notes and deep bass notes. From bar 12, long drawn-out trills in both hands and from bar 17, raging arpeggios and sequences in the top voice build further towards a climax. Then the last sixteen bars repeat the simple theme ‚Äì just as if nothing had happened ‚Äì and it fades away quietly.  The work as a whole  Already in the first two movements, many musicologists see motifs, scale passages, rhythmic models and characteristic idioms that reach their full potential only in the third movement. J√ºrgen Uhde does not consider the first two movements to be completely self-sufficient constructions in their own right. Rather, often in concealed ways, they already foreshadow the theme of the third movement as the goal of the whole sonata. Richard Rosenberg, in his \\"reductions\\", concentrates more on the commonalities among the bass and middle voices of the movements. Starting with the first eight bars of the first movement, he reduces the bass progressions of each movement to a fundamental model of a stepwise descent followed by an ascent in leaps. This approach recalls Heinrich Schenker's determination of an Ursatz through his technique of reductive analysis. Uhde and others often point out the danger of too much interpretative license indicating parallels between passages that are scarcely related.

It is found in forests at up to 1500 m altitude, always near water. The pair builds a bulky domed nest with a side entrance on a sloping bank next to a stream or path, and the female lays two white eggs which are incubated for 16‚Äì17 days with another 13‚Äì14 days to fledging. The buff-rumped warbler is 13‚Äì13.5 cm long and weighs 14.5 g. The nominate race M. f. fulvicauda of western Amazonia in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil is dark olive-brown above with a grey head, buff supercilium, and the conspicuous rich buff rump and upper tail that give this species its English and scientific names. The lower half of the tail is blackish. The underparts are whitish with some buff on the flanks. The sexes are similar, but the young bird is browner on the upperparts, head and breast, and its rump is paler. There are five other subspecies. * M. f. semicervina, is found in the Choc√≥ from eastern Panama to north-western Peru. It is similar to fulvicauda, but the buff area of the tail is larger and paler, and the buff on the flanks is more extensive. * M. f. motacilla, from the Magdalena Valley in Colombia, is similar to semicervina, but the buff area of the tail is paler, and upperparts more olive. * M. f. leucopygia, from the Caribbean slope in Central America is a distinctive form, with a much paler buff rump, a white supercilium, dark legs, and dark spotting on the breast. * M. f. veraguensis, from the Pacific slope in Central America is like leucopygia, but less spotted and with a somewhat darker rump. * M. f. significans of south-eastern Peru and northern Bolivia has a less extensive buff rump than other subspecies, and olive upperparts. This is a common species, easily seen and identified as it hops on the ground, pumping and swinging its broad tail constantly. The buff-rumped warbler primarily feeds on insects, spiders and other small invertebrates, taken on the ground or in flight in open areas along the banks of streams, puddles, roadsides or tracks. Pairs defend their linear feeding territories along a stretch of stream throughout the year. The call note of the buff-rumped warbler is a hard tschik like northern waterthrush, and the male's song is a warble followed by a series of 8-15 ringing chew notes. The female may give a soft reply.

It strives to advocate for the national recognition of Castile, and in some cases, its independence. Other current political parties include Tierra Comunera, Castilian Party, and Ahora Castilla. History Castilian Left and the other parties are categorized as part of a major political movement known as Castilian nationalism. It defends the traditions and values from the rebels of the Castilian War of the Communities, so they call themselves \\"comuneros\\". As a group of Castilian nationalists, they also seek to unify the other Spanish Autonomous Communities of Cantabria, Castile y Leon, Castile-La Mancha, La Rioja, and Madrid. Izquierda Castellana constituted a definitive movement in Madrid by the year 2002, as a section of Izquierda Comunera, which also included the organizations Unidad Popular Castellana, YESCA (formerly known as Juventudes Castellanas Revolucionarias), Mujeres Castellanas and the C√≠rculo Castellano de Toledo. The Communist Party of the Castilian People (a section of the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain in the autonomous region of Castilla y Le√≥n) joined on as part of Izquierda Castellana, but later left the organization. Izquierda Castellana also supports various nationalist movements around the world, such as those in the Basque Country, Palestine or Ireland, emphasizing a democratic perspective and the sovereignty of the working class. Ideology The goal of Izquierda Castellana is the attainment of what they call a united Castile, overcoming the current division of the Castilian \\"nation\\" between five autonomous regions (Cantabria, Castile and Le√≥n, Madrid, La Rioja and Castile-La Mancha) and a comarca (Requena-Utiel in the Valencian Community). It emphasizes socialism, sovereignty and republicanism, principles it reaffirms each year on April 23, in a special ceremony in the municipality of Villalar de los Comuneros. This day is celebrated by Castilian nationalist organizations such as Izquierda Castellana and Tierra Comunera as the National Day of Castile, but officially it is the festivity of the autonomous region of Castile and Le√≥n. Tierra Comunera A Castilian nationalist political party that seeks the defense of the rights and freedoms of the Castilian people, the constant exercise of their decision-making capacity, the progressive transformation of their society in order to achieve freedom and the preservation of their historical heritage, as the most valuable legacy to pass on to future generations. It currently does not assume a social, economic, and cultural role that defines Castile. It holds great value towards many aspects of the human nature, which includes cultural and environmental ideals, its production of raw materials of high quality, and most importantly, the existence of a political power at the service of its citizens, should allow the Castilian people build a society more prosperous and developed, that satisfaction appropriate to the needs of the people. As an organization that is fully committed to unify the Castilians amongst themselves and the rest of Spain, Tierra Comunera is responsible for multiple organized experiences that are developed by the people giving them continuity and gathering the best thing of all of them to plan a way that incorporates the illusion of all the persons and sectors that believe for a possible and united Castile. Yesca A Castilian youth organization that specialized in combat action that creates struggles by the Revolutionary Youth of their land: Castilla. Yesca arose from the militant representation that during the decade of the 90s and the early years of the new millennium that was carried out by the Revolutionary Youth Castilian. It was not simply a change of name but the natural evolution of the project after years of struggles and experiences of another step in the construction of a real Spanish organization qualified to give answers to the problems that they suffer as young. Yesca is committed to bring together people that want to real changes in society, fighting from the framework of the construction of Castile between everyone. It is something that traditionally ignite the spark; the symbolic name presents to us as what we aspire to be and a catalytic tool of ideas and actions that will lead us to kindle the flame of the social revolution, gender and national they need. Villalar de los Comuneros Day of Castile in Villalar de los Comuneros. For the last three decades, tens of thousands of Castilian attend \\"Villarlar of the Comuneros\\" on April 23 to celebrate the day of Castile. The Battle of Villalar was a battle in the Revolt of the Comuneros fought near the town of Villalar in Valladolid province, Spain. The royalist supporters of King Charles I won a crushing victory over the comuneros rebels. Three of the most important rebel leaders were captured, Juan de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado. They were executed the next day, effectively ending armed resistance to Charles I. The Battle of Villalar represents an important historical event in Castile because it marked the end of autocratic Spanish monarchy.

A significant concentration of ironwood (also known as desert ironwood, Olneya tesota) trees is found in the monument, along with two federally recognized endangered animal and plant species. More than 200 Hohokam and Paleo-Indian archaeological sites have been identified in the monument, dated between 600 and 1450. Flora and fauna Ironwood Forest National Monument, Arizona. Flora An array of flora are present in the Ironwood Forest National Monument. The higher elevations have the pinyon-juniper woodland plant community. The lower elevations are in the Sonoran Desert ecoregion. One of the notable trees native here is the elephant tree (Bursera microphylla).C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

Stromberg Small populations of the endangered Nichols turk's head cactus, although not found among ironwood trees, occur in very localized limestone-rich areas within the monument. ;Ironwood trees The desert ironwood (Olneya tesota) is a very long-lived tree, with some specimens estimated to be more than 800 years old.\\"The Importance of Olneya tesota as a Nurse Plant in the Sonoran Desert\\", Humberto Suzan, Gary P. Nabhan, Duncan T. Patten, Journal of Vegetation Science, Vol. 7, No. 5 (Oct., 1996), pp. 635-644 Desert ironwood is a keystone species because it provides a nursery environment of shade and protection that enables young seedlings of other species to become established despite the harsh desert climate, where daytime high temperatures can exceed . The ironwood also provides shade and roosting area habitats for birds. Its smoky lavender-colored blossoms provide nectar for bees and other insects, as well as forage for animals. The blossoms produce bean pods which also provide food for desert animals. ;Prehistoric ecology Lists of dominant plants in the prehistoric ecology and plant community of the Waterman Mountains area in the monument have been published in a sequence that currently dates back to the last glacial period, the Late Wisconsin glatial period. Dominant trees of that era, based upon pollen records, were Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), and redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii), and understory plants included Monardella arizonica. Fauna According to Proclamation 7320, 674 plant and animal species have been identified in the Silver Bell Mountains within the monument, including 64 species of mammals and 57 species of birds, although the Bureau of Land Management has been unable to verify those claims. Recent studies by the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, however, have documented 560 plant species.Biological Survey of Ironwood Forest National Monument, Vascular Flora. Thomas R. Van Devender, John F. Wiens, and Mark Dimmitt. Resident birdwatchers have documented more than 80 species of migratory and non-migratory birds.Public comments submitted to Bureau of Land Management regarding the Ironwood Forest National Monument Draft Resource Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement, May 30, 2007. One specimen of the endangered lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris curasoae) and a night roost were documented within the monument by bat researchers Karen Krebbs and Yar Petryszyn. They concluded that while the monument may be an important feeding stopover during spring migrations, the presence of L. curasoae in the monument is probably low or incidental.Biological Survey of Ironwood Forest National Monument, Karen Krebbs and Yar Petryszyn, Arizona Sonora Desert MuseumLeptonycteris curasoae is one of only a few bat species that migrate long distances, coming from as far south as Jalisco, Mexico, more than . The Arizona desert bighorn sheep herd located within the monument is the last remaining relict population of desert bighorn sheep in southeastern Arizona, having first migrated into North America during the Pleistocene epoch. One or two specimens of the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, which was listed as an endangered species in March 1997 and delisted by court order April 14, 2006, have been found within and near the monument by licensed surveyors.Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy Owl records of US Fish and Wildlife Service History The Hohokam people were the first miners in the area. They mined andesite, which was useful for making agave knives. Andesite knives that originated from Hohokham mines within the monument perimeter have been found as far south as the Gulf of California in Mexico. Silver and copper mining began in the Silver Bell Mountains around 1850 and continues today. Bighorn sheep ewes prefer mine tailings for lambing grounds because the high, steep and open terrain enables them to see and escape from predators. Activities The Ironwood Forest National Monument is managed for multiple uses including recreation, cattle grazing and mining, although new mining claims and motorized off-road travel are prohibited by the establishing Proclamation. Livestock grazing, which has occurred continuously for at least the last 125 years within the monument, is currently managed at very light or conservative levels of approximately one cow per every 300 to . Domestic sheep and goats are prohibited as a protection to the bighorn sheep. The monument offers almost no surface water but contains sufficient groundwater resources. The cattle ranchers maintain more than 80 individual man-made water sources within the monument, in addition to the 14 water sources maintained by the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society.

They were notable for having a small zippered pocket on the side of the shoe, large enough for a small amount of loose change, keys, etc. White KangaRoos sneakers KangaROOS were designed by American architect and jogging enthusiast Bob Gamm. Gamm was a running enthusiast who would go ten kilometers a day, but preferred light athletic clothes without pockets. He designed the sneakers for his own personal use as a place to store his keys and money, then marketed them effectively. His marketing design was successful, leading to sales in excess of 700,000 pairs a month by the early 1980s.KangaROOS website in the history section. Further refinements on the original design led to several significant innovations in athletic footwear. One such innovation, the Dynacoil, was a patented energy release system designed in the mid-1980s by former Nike designer Ray Tonkel and consultant Al Gross and tested by NASA.Pentland website -- a KangaROOS partner Many other athletic shoe manufacturers would later incorporate similar designs into their shoes. In the early- to mid-1980s many USA professional athletes wore ROOS football and baseball shoes as well as shoes for running and training. Notables included Clyde Drexler (Basketball), Walter Payton, O.J. Anderson, William (the Fridge) Perry (football), Ozzie Smith, Vince Coleman and Ron Darling (baseball), and Kenyan track stars (running). There was a faddish dimension to the shoes, which became very popular among both casual athletes and American schoolchildren. Gamm himself remained committed to KangaROOS as serious athletic footwear, and in 1985 he worked with a 10,000-square-meter testing facility called the KangaROOS Laboratory & Gymnasium at the University of Illinois. This allowed for refinement and development of the sneakers for many different sports, including American football, basketball, hockey, tennis, and track and field. By the end of the 1980s, the popularity of the sneakers was on the decline, executives departed the company and KangaROOS were quietly withdrawn from the market. However, nostalgia, combined with an appreciation both of the shoe's athletic design and its ubiquitous pocket, led to a reappearance of the shoe in the late 1990s. Today, KangaROOS are sold in over sixty countries worldwide.KangaROOS site, front page and history section Recent years have witnessed expansion through Central and South America as well as Asia. The footwear moved its strategic focus from performance sports to sports lifestyle footwear, most still bearing the zippered pocket on the side. Some, however, now have a side pouch up on the ankle, which can hold a small wallet.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, it is now the performing arts center of Mercer University.http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2009/090922Grand.htm  History  The Academy of Music was constructed in 1884 with the largest stage in the southeastern United States and seating for 2,418, almost one-fifth of Macon's population at the time. The building was renovated in 1905; the present seven-story facade was added and the building reopened as the Grand Opera House. The Grand has had numerous historic uses; live horses and chariots appeared in a 1908 production of Ben-Hur and during World War I, actor Charlie Chaplin led the John Philip Sousa band for a fundraising effort. The theater has also hosted, among others, Sarah Bernhardt, Will Rogers, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, Bob Hope, the Allman Brothers Band, and Ray Charles. Magician Harry Houdini was also a featured player at the Grand, leaving a well-known legacy: the stage sports a number of trap doors, one of which remains operational and is used occasionally today in performances such as annual production of The Nutcracker ballet. Local lore claims that the trap doors were installed specifically for Houdini. In 1936, as the popularity of vaudeville waned, the Grand changed to a movie theater, hosting Macon's only Hollywood premiere, 1945's God is My Co- Pilot.  Revival  By the 1960s, the Grand had ceased showing movies and plans were made to replace it with a parking lot. Those plans were blocked in 1967 by the Macon Arts Council, a group formed to save and restore the Grand; the group held a fundraising gala featuring the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and had the property placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Among the founders of the group was Macon architect Ellamae Ellis League who also supervised a restoration of The Grand so it could reopen as a live theater in 1969. (The second balcony, or peanut gallery, remained closed to the public and was dedicated to lighting equipment at this time, reducing the maximum seating to its current number of 1,030). Fund-raising efforts continued through the next several decades, with ongoing physical plant upgrades, with another renovation taking place in 1985. In 1995, Mercer University signed a lease with Bibb County to manage the Grand.

Life Magnus was born in Ratzeburg, the second son of John V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Dorothea of Brandenburg, daughter of Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg. In 1481 John V redeemed Saxe-Lauenburg's exclave Land of Hadeln, which had been pawned to Hamburg as security for a credit of 3,000 Rhenish guilders since 1407.Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, \\"Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der fr√ºhen Neuzeit\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)' (1995): pp. 321‚Äì388, here p. 331. . John V then made his son and heir apparent, Magnus, vicegerent of Hadeln, and finally regent as of 1498.Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, \\"Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der fr√ºhen Neuzeit\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)' (1995): pp. 321‚Äì388, here p. 332. . Vicegerent and regent of the Land of Hadeln In 1484 Magnus, who aimed at increasing his local revenues, had reached out to conquer the rich neighbouring Land of Wursten, a de facto autonomous region of free Frisian peasants in a North Sea marsh at the Weser estuary, but he failedKarl Ernst Hermann Krause, \\"Johann III., Erzbischof von Bremen\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. 14, pp. 183‚Äì185, here p. 184.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 266. . Magnus tried to justify his violent act with the pretence that Wursten used to be Saxon before the imperial deposition of Duke Henry the Lion and the carve-up of his Duchy of Saxony in 1180, which only brought Magnus' Ascanian dynasty to take the belittled dukedom.Heinz- Joachim Schulze, \\"Johann III. Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. 10, pp. 480seq., here p. 480. The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, claiming Wursten for itself, was alarmed. After becoming Regent Magnus planned a new conquest of Wursten. On 24 November 1498 Magnus allied with his father and Henry IV, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg to conquer Wursten. Henry IV obliged to send 3,000 lansquenets, who should gain their payment by ravaging and plundering the free peasants of Wursten, once successfully subjected. Bremen's Prince-Archbishop Johann Rode had prepared for this, he and Hamburg's three burgomasters (upcoming, presiding, and outgoing), Johannes Huge, Hermen Langenbeck and Henning Buring had concluded a defensive alliance on 16 November. Hamburg feared for its exclave Ritzeb√ºttel, its military outpost at the Outer Elbe to defend the free access to Hamburg via Elbe, thus the city became the driving force in preparing everything for Magnus' eventual attack. Rode appealed at the burghers of Bremen, Hamburg and Stade, which considered the areas downstream the rivers Elbe and Weser their own front yard existential for their free maritime trade connections, so the three cities supported Rode, who further won the Ditmarsians, free peasants under Bremen's loose overlordship. On 1 May Rode gathered representatives of the Land of Wursten, of the cities of Hamburg and Bremen and they concluded a defensive alliance in favour of Wursten in case of another invasion by John XIV of Oldenburg, who had conquered westerly neighbouring Butjadingen in April with the help of the Black Guard. Wursten was thus threatened by Oldenburg from the west and by Magnus from the east. In order to avoid war on two fronts Rode tried to ease the relation with Magnus, but in vain. On 1 August Rode, Bremen's cathedral chapter, more prelates from the prince-archbishopric, as well as the cities of Bremen, Buxtehude, Hamburg, and Stade concluded a war alliance to supply 1,300 warriors and equipment to defend Wursten and / or invade Hadeln, while all members of Bremian ministerialis and nobility abstained. Many a member of ministerialis and nobility rather sided with Magnus.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 267. . Finally on 9 September 1499 Rode waged feud against John V and Magnus. The allied forces easily conquered the Land of Hadeln, defeating Magnus and even driving him out of Hadeln. By 20 November 1499 Magnus hired the so-called Great or Black Guard of ruthless and violent Dutch and East Frisian mercenaries, commanded by Thomas Slentz, prior operating in Oldenburg. Their invasion into the prince-archbishopric was repelled at Bremen, however, upstream they succeeded to cross the Weser in the neighbouring Prince- Bishopric of Verden near Verden city by the end of November, ravaging the prince-bishopric, especially looting and robbing the monasteries, heading northeastwards towards L√ºneburg-Celle.Karl Ernst Hermann Krause, \\"Johann III., Erzbischof von Bremen\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. 14, pp. 183‚Äì185, here p. 185seq.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here pp. 267seq. Having crossed the latter's border the Guard turned westwards into the Bremian prince-archbishopric, by-passing the fortified Buxtehude and Stade, leaving behind a wake of devastation on the countryside and in the monasteries (, Neukloster, both localities of today's Buxtehude, Himmelpforten Convent).Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 268. . Since prince-archiepiscopal forces secured V√∂rde the Guard circumvented them southerly, not sparing Zeven . Finally on Christmas Eve arriving downstream the Weser in Lehe the Black Guard tried to invade Wursten, however, the free peasants there repelled their attack near Weddewarden on 26 December.Karl Ernst Hermann Krause, \\"Johann III., Erzbischof von Bremen\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. 14, pp. 183‚Äì185, here p. 185. So the Guard turned northeastwards, looting Neuenwalde Nunnery underways, into Hadeln, recapturing it for Magnus in early 1500. For the Hadelers, however, this invasion meant no less man slaughter, looting and incendiary than for the rural population in the prince- archbishopric.Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, \\"Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der fr√ºhen Neuzeit\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 321‚Äì388, here pp. 334seq. . By early December Rode turned for help to Duke Henry IV the Elder, who was actually allied with Magnus.Karl Schleif, Regierung und Verwaltung des Erzstifts Bremen, Hamburg: no publ., 1972, (=Schriftenreihe des Landschaftsverbandes der ehemaligen Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden; vol. 1), p. 20, also Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1968. In return Rode had to offer appointing Henry's 12-year-old son Christopher as his coadjutor, a position usually (as coadiutor cum iure succedendi), and in this case indeed, entailing the succession to the respective see. This exactly accomplished Henry's own expansionist ambitions, so he changed sides, dropped the alliance with Magnus and John V in order to militarily support the prince- archbishopric. Henry IV the Elder and his troops were now hunting the Black Guard. Magnus, unable to pay the mercenaries so that they turned even the more oppressive for Hadeln's population, was like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who could not get rid of \\"the spirits that he called\\". By mid-January 1500 King John of Denmark finally hired the Guard and guaranteed for its safe conduct to his Holstein. King John employed the Black Guard in order to subject Ditmarsh. It were the Ditmarsians then, who destroyed the Black Guard utterly in the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500 and thus King John's dream of subjecting them. Magnus conflict with Bremen was solved through the mediation of Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-Calenberg and Henry IV with the latter's son Coadjutor Christopher (Prince-Archbishop of Bremen as of 1511). So Rode and Magnus had concluded peace on 20 January 1500. Hadeln was restored to Magnus, while the Wursteners rendered homage to Rode on 18 August, who in return had confirmed their autonomy, thus in fact little had changed as compared with the status quo ante.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 269. . Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg proper During the declining years of his father he governed the country and succeeded his father as the regnant Duke in 1507. The first years of his governing has been filled by various conflicts with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and its suffragan Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg. Through his marriage with Catherine in 1509 Magnus further intensified his ties with her father Henry IV, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, his deserted former war ally. Magnus was the first Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, who adopted a compliant position as to the dispute on the electoral privilege between Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. He refrained from showing on his coat-of-arms on a sable and argent background the electoral swords () in gules. The electoral swords indicated the office as Imperial Arch-Marshal (Erzmarschall, Archimarescallus), pertaining to the privilege as prince-elector, besides the much more important right to elect the new emperor after the decease of the former. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, enfeoffed Magnus with the Duchy of Saxony, Angria and Westphalia (so its official name, but colloquially Saxe-Lauenburg) and the pertaining regalia at the imperial diet in Augsburg on 12 November 1530. The imperial writ of feoffment emphasises, that Magnus had requested to be also enfeoffed with the Saxon electoral privilege, however, further explaining that this could not happen at that time \\"due to moving reasons\\". For Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, had already enfeoffed the House of Wettin with the Electorate of Saxony on 1 August 1425. In 1531 Magnus introduced the Reformation in his duchy and became Lutheran, as did most of his subjects. Magnus died and was buried in Ratzeburg. Family and children He was married on 17‚Äì20 November 1509 with Catherine (1488 ‚Äì 29 July 1563) in Wolfenb√ºttel, daughter of Duke Henry IV, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and they had six children: * Francis I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg (1510 ‚Äì 19 March 1581) * Dorothea (9 July 1511 ‚Äì 7 October 1571), married on 29 October 1525 to King Christian III of Denmark * Catherine (24 September 1513 ‚Äì 23 September 1535), married on 24 September 1531 to King Gustav I of Sweden * Clara (13 December 1518 ‚Äì 27 March 1576), married on 29 September 1547 to Francis, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Prince of Gifhorn * Sophia (1521 ‚Äì 13 May 1571), married on 1 January 1537 to Anthony I, Count of Oldenburg-Delmenhorst * Ursula (ca. 1523 ‚Äì 31 December 1577, Minden), married on 14 May 1551 to Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin AncestryNotesReferences and external links * Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, \\"Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der fr√ºhen Neuzeit\\", in: Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser: 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg und Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.), Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem.

NASA photo by Richard F. Gordon Jr. The physical exploration of the Moon began when Luna 2, a space probe launched by the Soviet Union, made an impact on the surface of the Moon on September 14, 1959. Prior to that the only available means of exploration had been observation from Earth. The invention of the optical telescope brought about the first leap in the quality of lunar observations. Galileo Galilei is generally credited as the first person to use a telescope for astronomical purposes; having made his own telescope in 1609, the mountains and craters on the lunar surface were among his first observations using it. NASA's Apollo program was the only program to successfully land humans on the Moon, which it did six times. The first landing took place in 1969, when two Apollo 11 astronauts placed scientific instruments and returned lunar samples to Earth. The first unmanned landing on the far side of the Moon was made by the Chinese spacecraft Chang'e 4 in early 2019, which successfully deployed the Yutu-2 lunar rover. Before spaceflight Robert Hooke's Micrographia, 1665 The earliest surviving daguerrotype of the Moon by John W. Draper (1840) Lewis Rutherfurd in 1865 The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former. His non-religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile. In his book On the Face in the Moon's Orb, Plutarch suggested that the Moon had deep recesses in which the light of the Sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms. He also entertained the possibility that the Moon was inhabited. Aristarchus went a step further and computed the distance from Earth, together with its size, obtaining a value of 20 times the Earth radius for the distance (the real value is 60; the Earth radius was roughly known since Eratosthenes). Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì202 AD) believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi, their 'radiating influence' theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun (mentioned by Anaxagoras above). This was supported by mainstream thinkers such as Jing Fang, who noted the sphericity of the Moon. Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095) of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent. By 499 AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his Aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is what causes the Moon to shine.Hayashi (2008), Aryabhata I Habash al-Hasib al- Marwazi, a Persian astronomer, conducted various observations at the Al- Shammisiyyah observatory in Baghdad between 825 and 835 AD. Using these observations, he estimated the Moon's diameter as 3,037 km (equivalent to 1,519 km radius) and its distance from the Earth as , which come close to the currently accepted values. In the 11th century, the Islamic physicist, Alhazen, investigated moonlight, which he proved through experimentation originates from sunlight and correctly concluded that it \\"emits light from those portions of its surface which the sun's light strikes.\\" By the Middle Ages, before the invention of the telescope, an increasing number of people began to recognise the Moon as a sphere, though many believed that it was \\"perfectly smooth\\". In 1609, Galileo Galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the Moon in his book and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters. Later in the 17th century, Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi drew a map of the Moon and gave many craters the names they still have today. On maps, the dark parts of the Moon's surface were called maria (singular mare) or seas, and the light parts were called terrae or continents. Thomas Harriot, as well as Galilei, drew the first telescopic representation of the Moon and observed it for several years. His drawings, however, remained unpublished. The first map of the Moon was made by the Belgian cosmographer and astronomer Michael Florent van Langren in 1645. Two years later a much more influential effort was published by Johannes Hevelius. In 1647 Hevelius published Selenographia, the first treatise entirely devoted to the Moon. Hevelius's nomenclature, although used in Protestant countries until the eighteenth century, was replaced by the system published in 1651 by the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who gave the large naked-eye spots the names of seas and the telescopic spots (now called craters) the name of philosophers and astronomers. In 1753 the Croatian Jesuit and astronomer Roger Joseph Boscovich discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. In 1824 Franz von Gruithuisen explained the formation of craters as a result of meteorite strikes. The possibility that the Moon contains vegetation and is inhabited by selenites was seriously considered by major astronomers even into the first decades of the 19th century. In 1834‚Äì1836, Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich M√§dler published their four-volume and the book in 1837, which firmly established the conclusion that the Moon has no bodies of water nor any appreciable atmosphere. Space race The Cold War-inspired \\"space race\\" and \\"Moon race\\" between the Soviet Union and the United States of America accelerated with a focus on the Moon. This included many scientifically important firsts, such as the first photographs of the then-unseen far side of the Moon in 1959 by the Soviet Union, and culminated with the landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969, widely seen around the world as one of the pivotal events of the 20th century, and indeed of human history in general. The first view returned of another world from space, photographed by Luna 3 in 1959, showed the Moon's far side.

Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to a boulder at Taurus-Littrow during the third EVA (extravehicular activity). Luna 16 first lunar sample return for the USSR in Sep 1970. The first artificial object to flyby the Moon was uncrewed Soviet probe Luna 1 on January 4, 1959 and went on to be the first probe to reach a heliocentric orbit around the Sun. Few knew that Luna 1 was designed to impact the surface of the Moon. The first probe to impact the surface of the Moon was the Soviet probe Luna 2, which made a hard landing on September 14, 1959, at 21:02:24 UTC. The far side of the Moon was first photographed on October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe Luna 3. Though vague by today's standards, the photos showed that the far side of the Moon almost completely lacked maria. The first American probe to flyby the Moon was Pioneer 4 on March 4, 1959 which occurred shortly after Luna 1. But it was the only success of 8 American probes that first attempted to launch for the Moon.https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/beyond_earth_detail.html In an effort to compete with these Soviet successes, U.S. President John F. Kennedy proposed the manned Moon landing in a Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs: > Now it is time to take longer strides - time for a great new American > enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space > achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth. > > ...For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can > guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. > > ...I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, > before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him > safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more > impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of > space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. Ranger 1 launched in Aug 1961, just 3 months after President Kennedy's speech. It would be 3 more years and six failed Ranger missions until Ranger 7 returned close up photos of the Lunar surface before impacting it in July 1964. A number of problems with launch vehicles, ground equipment, and spacecraft electronics plagued the Ranger program and early probe missions in general. These lessons helped in Mariner 2, the only successful U.S. space probe after Kennedy's famous speech to congress and before his death in Nov 1963.https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth- tagged.pdf U.S. success rates improved greatly from Ranger 7 onward. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed Ranger with the Surveyor programhttps://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1964-082A ‚Äì 24 January 2020 sending seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. Five of the seven spacecraft successfully soft-landed, investigating if the regolith (dust) was shallow enough for astronauts to stand on the Moon. On December 24, 1968, the crew of Apollo 8, Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, became the first human beings to enter lunar orbit and see the far side of the Moon in person. Humans first landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. The first human to walk on the lunar surface was Neil Armstrong, commander of the U.S. mission Apollo 11. The first robot lunar rover to land on the Moon was the Soviet vessel Lunokhod 1 on November 17, 1970, as part of the Lunokhod programme. To date, the last human to stand on the Moon was Eugene Cernan, who as part of the Apollo 17 mission, walked on the Moon in December 1972. See also: A full list of lunar Apollo astronauts. Moon rock samples were brought back to Earth by three Luna missions (Luna 16, 20, and 24) and the Apollo missions 11 through 17 (except Apollo 13, which aborted its planned lunar landing). Luna 24 in 1976 was the last Lunar mission by either the Soviet Union or the U.S. until Clementine in 1994. Focus shifted to: probes to other planets, space stations, and the Shuttle program. Before the Moon race the U.S. had pre-projects for scientific and military moonbases: the Lunex Project and Project Horizon. Besides crewed landings, the abandoned Soviet crewed lunar programs included the building of a multipurpose moonbase \\"Zvezda\\", the first detailed project, complete with developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules. After 1990 Cassini‚ÄìHuygens took this image during its lunar flyby, before it traveled to Saturn In 1990 Japan visited the Moon with the Hiten spacecraft, becoming the third country to place an object in orbit around the Moon. The spacecraft released the Hagoromo probe into lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, thereby preventing further scientific use of the spacecraft. In September 2007, Japan launched the SELENE spacecraft, with the objectives \\"to obtain scientific data of the lunar origin and evolution and to develop the technology for the future lunar exploration\\", according to the JAXA official website. The European Space Agency launched a small, low-cost lunar orbital probe called SMART 1 on September 27, 2003. SMART 1's primary goal was to take three-dimensional X-ray and infrared imagery of the lunar surface. SMART 1 entered lunar orbit on November 15, 2004 and continued to make observations until September 3, 2006, when it was intentionally crashed into the lunar surface in order to study the impact plume. China has begun the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program for exploring the Moon and is investigating the prospect of lunar mining, specifically looking for the isotope helium-3 for use as an energy source on Earth. China launched the Chang'e 1 robotic lunar orbiter on October 24, 2007. Originally planned for a one-year mission, the Chang'e 1 mission was very successful and ended up being extended for another four months. On March 1, 2009, Chang'e 1 was intentionally impacted on the lunar surface completing the 16-month mission. On October 1, 2010, China launched the Chang'e 2 lunar orbiter. China landed the rover Chang'e 3 on the Moon on December 14, 2013, became the third country to have done so. Chang'e 3 is the first spacecraft to soft-land on lunar surface since Luna 24 in 1976. Since the Chang'e 3 mission was a success, the backup lander Chang'e 4 was re-purposed for the new mission goals. China launched on 7 December 2018 the Chang'e 4 mission to the lunar farside.China launches historic mission to land on far side of the Moon Stephen Clark, Spaceflight Now. 07 December 2018. On 3 January 2019, Chang'e 4 landed on the far side of the Moon. Chang'e 4 deployed the Yutu-2 moon rover, which subsequently became the current record distance-holder for lunar surface travel.

The lunar probe was originally intended to orbit the Moon for two years, with scientific objectives to prepare a three- dimensional atlas of the near and far side of the Moon and to conduct a chemical and mineralogical mapping of the lunar surface.http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Sep192008/national2008091890838.asp The orbiter released the Moon Impact Probe which impacted the Moon at 15:04 GMT on November 14, 2008 making India the fourth country to reach the lunar surface. Among Chandrayaan's many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in the lunar soil.Lunar Missions Detect Water on Moon This mission was followed up by Chandrayaan-2 which launched on 22 July 2019 and entered lunar orbit on 20 August 2019. Chandrayaan-2 also carried India's first lander and rover, but these crash-landed. Animation of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter trajectory from 23 June 2009 to 30 June 2009 The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and NASA launched the Clementine mission in 1994, and Lunar Prospector in 1998. NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, on June 18, 2009, which has collected imagery of the Moon's surface. It also carried the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), which investigated the possible existence of water in Cabeus crater. GRAIL is another mission, launched in 2011. The first commercial mission to the Moon was accomplished by the Manfred Memorial Moon Mission (4M), led by LuxSpace, an affiliate of German OHB AG. The mission was launched on 23 October 2014 with the Chinese Chang'e 5-T1 test spacecraft, attached to the upper stage of a Long March 3C/G2 rocket. The 4M spacecraft made a Moon flyby on a night of 28 October 2014, after which it entered elliptical Earth orbit, exceeding its designed lifetime by four times. The Beresheet lander operated by Israel Aerospace Industries and SpaceIL impacted the Moon on 11 April 2019 after a failed landing attempt. Plans Following the abandoned US Constellation program, plans for crewed flights followed by moonbases were declared by Russia, ESA, China, Japan and India. All of them intend to continue the exploration of Moon with more uncrewed spacecraft. China planned to conduct a sample return mission with its Chang'e 5 spacecraft in 2017, but that mission has been postponed due to the failure of the Long March 5 launch vehicle. However, after a successful return of flight by its Long March 5 in late December, 2019, China is targeting its Chang'e 5 sample return mission in late 2020. India may launch another lunar mission in 2021: the Chandrayaan-3, and it is studying a potential collaboration with Japan to launch the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission in 2024. Russia also announced plans to resume its previously frozen project Luna-Glob, an uncrewed lander and orbiter, which is slated to launch in 2021. In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place an astronaut on the Moon by 2030 leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid a space race Russian Orel spacecraft is planned to send cosmonauts into Moon orbit in 2025. Russian Lunar Orbital Station is then proposed to orbit around the Moon after 2030. In 2018 NASA released plans to \\"return to the Moon with commercial and international partners as part of an overall agency Exploration Campaign in support of Space Policy Directive 1, giving rise to the Artemis program and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). NASA plans to start with robotic missions on the lunar surface, as well as the crewed Lunar Gateway. As of 2019, NASA is issuing contracts to develop new small lunar payload delivery services, develop lunar landers, and conduct more research on the Moon's surface ahead of a human return. Artemis program involves several flights of the Orion spacecraft and lunar landings from 2022 to 2028.\\"National Space Exploration Campaign Report\\" (PDF). NASA. September 2018.

Kuwabara was born in Tokyo in 1913. He started taking photographs around 1931 with a Vest Pocket Kodak, but his interest increased as a result of an invitation by his neighbor Hiroshi Hamaya to go to a photo-shoot in Kamakura. His photograph, taken with a Leica C, won second prize in the related contest, leading him to submit his work to photographic magazines, which accepted them. In 1940, he went to Manchuria to take photographs for military purposes. He returned after the war and became editor of the magazine Camera and thereafter edited other photographic magazines, putting the nurture of new talent and photographic criticism ahead of his own photography. Kuwabara's own photographs received more critical attention from the late 1960s, but the revival in his work only took off in the mid-1970s.As late as 1973 he was not profiled within Shashinka hyakunin: Kao to shashin (, 100 photographers: Profiles and photographs), a 20th-anniversary special publication of Camera Mainichi magazine (Tokyo). He came to be regarded as one of the foremost street photographers, particularly among those active before the war. While his earlier photographs of Tokyo had concentrated on Asakusa and elsewhere in the Shitamachi (area traditionally populated by artisans), his later photographs (many in color) show Setagaya-ku, where he later lived. Nobuyoshi Araki did much to promote the revival of interest in Kuwabara's works, and the pair had a joint exhibition, \\"Love you Tokyo\\", in the Setagaya Art Museum in summer 1993. Kuwabara died on 10 December 2007, a fact that was only announced in February 2008. \\"Shashinka no Kuwabara Kineo-san no shikyo: Senzen-sengo no kiroku\\" (, Death of the photographer Kineo Kuwabara, who documented Tokyo before and after the war), Asahi Shinbun, asahi.com.

The Markandeya Purana especially, comprises a dialogue between Markandeya and a sage called Jaimini, and a number of chapters in the Bhagavata Purana are dedicated to his conversations and prayers.Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 12, Chapter 8: Markandeya's Prayers to Nara-Narayana Rishi He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata. Markandeya is venerated within all mainstream Hindu traditions. Today, Markandeya Tirtha, where the sage Markandeya wrote the Markandeya Purana is situated on a trekking route to the Yamunotri Shrine in the Uttarkashi district, Uttarakhand.Yamunotri Temple Uttarkashi district website. Rescued by Kalantaka-Shiva One legend relates the story of how Shiva protected Markandeya from the clutches of death, personified as Yama. The great sage Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result, he was given the choice of either a righteous son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life. Mrikandu rishi chose the former, and was blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of 16. Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva. Yama then came in person to take away Markandeya's life, and sprung his noose around the young sage's neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, and out of it, Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression. After defeating Yama in battle to the point of death, Shiva then revived him, under the condition that the devout youth would live forever. For this act, Shiva was thereafter also known as Kalantaka (\\"Ender of Death\\"). This event, it is said, took place on the bank of river Gomati in Kaithi, Varanasi. An ancient temple Markandeya Mahadeva Temple is made on this site. Its the place where river Ganga and river Gomati merges so being a Sangam area, its sacredness increases. As sourced from Sati Purana, a secret portion of Markandeya Purana, Goddess Parvati also gave him a boon to write a text on veera charitra (Brave character) on her, the text is famously known as Durga Saptashati, a valuable portion in Markandeya Purana.Sati Purana  David Kinsely English translation  2012 edition The place is known as Yamkeshwar. Eternal life Another story which deals with Markandeya's long life gives an account of how he lived past the death of the previous world and watched it end through gaining knowledge from Lord Vishnu. Bhagavata Purana Markandeya prays to Vishnu A tale from the Bhagavata Purana states that once sage Markandeya visited Narayana rishi and asked him for a boon. Markandeya prayed to the sage Narayana to show him his illusory power or Maya since sages Nara-Narayana are incarnation of Supreme Lord Narayana. To fulfill his wish, Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of a child floating on a leaf, and declared to the sage that he was Time and Death. Sage Markandeya entered into his mouth and saved himself from the surging water. Inside the boy's stomach Markandeya discovered all the worlds, the seven regions and the seven oceans. The mountains and the kingdoms were all there. So were all living beings. Markandeya did not know what to make of all this. He started to pray to Lord Vishnu. No sooner had he started, than he came out of the boy's mouth. Lord Vishnu now appeared before him and blessed him. The sage spent a thousand years with Lord Vishnu. He composed the Bala Mukundashtakam at this moment.http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/9/en1 Bhagavata Purana, Canto 12, Chapter 9: MƒÅrka·πá·∏çeya ·πöi·π£hi Sees the Illusory Potency of the Lord Narayana He taught [Bhishma] duties of Yatis.

It is a bitter with a straw-golden hue. Stones Bitter was first brewed in 1948 by William Stones Ltd at the Cannon Brewery in Sheffield. It was designed for the local steelworkers and became successful in its local area, becoming one of Sheffield's best known products. The brewing giant Bass acquired William Stones in the 1960s, and began to heavily promote the keg variant of Stones Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted at the expense of the traditional unpasteurised and unfiltered cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV of Stones was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, Stones reverted from a national into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, Stones has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, Stones became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors). Stones was promoted through a series of television advertisements in the 1980s that starred Michael Angelis and Tony Barton. It eventually became the United Kingdom's longest ever running bitter campaign. Stones sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship and its successor the Rugby Super League throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  History  The head brewer Edward \\"Ted\\" Collins first produced Stones Bitter at the Cannon Brewery in 1948. It was designed for the steelworkers of Sheffield's Lower Don Valley. The product was formulated as the working classes began to favour bitter over the dark mild style of beer. The beer's straw colour made it reasonably unusual for the time, and its individuality helped it to become an immediate success. By the 1960s its local reputation was \\"colossal\\", and it accounted for 80 per cent of William Stones' sales. Stones had such a strong local following that it was described as being \\"more of a religion than a beer.\\" From 1979, keg Stones began to be promoted heavily nationwide, and the beer was introduced to the South of England for the first time. CAMRA Hertfordshire Newsletter, February 1979, No. 13 The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s Stones Bitter was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this ceased after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer. Stones Bitter became the highest selling beer for Bass Breweries from 1981, when it overtook Worthington E in sales. Stones was the ninth most popular beer in the United Kingdom in 1989, with two per cent of all beer sales.Competition Commission 2001 Report, Chapter 4: The Market Demand was such that the Cannon Brewery was paying up to ¬£1.5 million per month in duty by 1991. Cask conditioned Stones won silver in the Bitter category in the CAMRA Champion Beer of Britain in 1991. Stones was the highest selling bitter in the UK by 1992, a million barrel a year brand, described by Bass as \\"a tremendously important brand with untapped potential\\". That same year, Bass were criticised for reducing the ABV of Stones from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV in order to reduce the impact of beer duty. The current packaging was introduced in 1994, and evokes Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and blacksmiths, and protector of craftsmen. In 1997, the Yorkshire Post described the beer as \\"one of Sheffield's most famous exports\\", and \\"a name which carries as much pride as the Made in Sheffield stamp.\\" In 1997, Bass decided to deprioritise Stones in order to concentrate on promoting Worthington as their national ale brand. Competition Commission Beer Report 1997, Chapter 4: The Market Stones' ABV was further reduced to 3.8 per cent in August 1998, and then to 3.7 per cent a few months later leading to its derision in the Yorkshire Evening Post.

In 2006, Off Licence News identified the canned variant as \\"continuing a slow but sure decline that has seen its status redefined from national brand to Yorkshire regional over the last decade.\\" As of 2012, Stones Bitter is among the twenty highest selling ales in the United Kingdom, with estimated annual volumes at over 100,000 hectolitres.Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics, 2012 Cask conditioned Stones Bitter is set to return, brewed under licence by Sheffield brewer TrueNorth.  Recipe and flavour  The recipes for brewery conditioned and cask conditioned Stones differed: Brewery conditioned Stones is brewed with a blend of hops from America (Columbus and Zeus) and Europe (Magnum and Admiral). The barley variety used is Pearl. The beer comes in kegs and 440ml cans, and is described as having a \\"fragrant grapefruit-citrus hop aroma, [which] cuts through a characteristically sulphury background with a fruity edge. The unusual salts balance ensures that the bitterness isn‚Äôt dry.\\" Cask conditioned Stones used Challenger hops, and was dry hopped with English Goldings. It was described as having an aroma of hops, sulphur and grapefruit, with a salty, moreish and zesty taste.  Advertising  A major television campaign ran nationally from 1983 until 1991 with the tagline (coined by playwright Peter Whelan): \\"(Wherever you may wander) there's no taste like Stones\\". The series initially starred Bernard Hill and Tony Barton, although Hill was replaced by Michael Angelis from 1984 onwards. The advertisements followed the characters of Jeff and Dave as they got into scrapes in various overseas locations, with humorous results. By 1987 it had become the UK's longest running bitter campaign of all time. From 1993 Stones was only advertised in the north of England. The 1994-96 \\"Sheffield Gold\\" campaign was set in a steel foundry: a nod to the city's heritage, although it was filmed in the Czech Republic because Sheffield's own foundries were considered to be too clean and automated for the desired gritty and industrial effect. A spokesman for Bass explained: \\"We wanted sparks and goggles.\\" It was to be the final major marketing push for Stones, and as of 2012 the only marketing support for the brand is the provision of Stones branded glassware and bar merchandise for regular stockists.  Sponsorships  Stones Bitter sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship from 1986 to 1995, and then its successor the Rugby Super League from 1996‚Äì7. A 1986‚Äì8 set of poster advertisements with the tagline \\"Stones, sheer poetry\\" supported the sponsorship. In 1995 and 1996, Stones sponsored the Doncaster Handicap and the Park Hill Stakes horse racing events. Stones Bitter are also sponsors of the Sheffield Steelers, they have a sponsor on the bottom of their jersey.

Its length is up to . Description The banded bellowsfish has a very deep, nearly round, highly compressed body, with a depth which is equivalent to 38‚Äì62% of its standard length. Its upper and lower body profiles are asymmetrical, as the nape of small specimens has an angular hump which becomes more angular and obvious as the fish grows into an adult. It has a long, tube-like snout, which is between a quarter and a third of the standard length. The spines of the dorsal fin are set into another hump on the posterior part of the fish's back, and the second dorsal fin is large, equivalent to just under half of the standard length. The pelvic fins are rather small. There are four well-developed bony plates located along the shoulder region, and the scales are modified into a coarse, teethlike form covering most of the body and head. The fish are predominantly whitish in colour with as many as five oblique orange bands with dark margins, although these bands lack dark margins in the largest adults. The ends of the dorsal, anal and caudal fins have a dusky to orange colour. The juveniles are bluish grey and have transparent fins and no bands. Juvenile banded bellowsfish were thought to be a separate species because of their very different appearance. Distribution The banded bellowsfish has a discontinuous, circumpolar distribution in the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere. In the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, it is found along the coast of South Africa from Cape Columbine to False Bay. The species has also been recorded in waters around Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. In the southwestern Atlantic, it is found off southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. In the southwest Pacific Ocean, these fish can be found in the coastal waters of Australia and New Zealand. In the southern Indian Ocean, it has been reported from √éle Saint-Paul to √éle Amsterdam. Habitat and biology The banded bellowsfish is a bathydemersal species of the continental shelf and the continental slope, found at depths of , although this range is restricted to between and off Australia. Unlike the seashorses and pipefishes, this species is oviparous, laying eggs which develop and hatch outside the body. It is carnivorous and preys on epibenthic invertebrates. Off Tasmania, it was found to prey mainly on benthic crustaceans and brittle stars, with the brittle stars making up most of the fish's diet, but it was also found to eat Hector's lanternfish (Lampanyctodes hectoris). It has been recorded in the stomach contents of New Zealand smooth skates (Dipterus innominatus) sampled along the Chatham Rise.

According to Hindu epics, Bhringi was an ancient sage (rishi), and a great devotee of Shiva, the Hindu God. According to epics, all the rishis paid homage to both Shiva and Parvati, consort of Shiva, but Bhringi would not worship Parvati and dedicated himself solely to Shiva . The story goes that Bhringi one day, came to Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva, and expressed his desire to go around Shiva . As he was going around, Shiva 's consort, Shakti, said, ‚ÄúYou cannot just go around him. You have to go around me too. We are two halves of the same truth.‚Äù Bhringi, however, was so focussed on Shiva that he had no desire to go around Shakti. Seeing this, Shakti sat on Shiva's lap making it difficult for Bhringi to go around Shiva alone. Bhringi, determined to go around Shiva took the form of a Bhring (Black Bee) and tried to slip in between the two. Amused by this, Shiva made Shakti one half of his body ‚Äì the famous Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva . This was God whose one half is the Goddess. But Bhringi was adamant. He would go around Shiva alone. So he took the form of a rat, some say a bee, and tried to gnaw his way between the two. This annoyed the Goddess so much that she said, ‚ÄúMay Bhringi lose all parts of the body that come from the mother.‚Äù In Tantra, the Indian school of alchemy, it is believed that the tough and rigid parts of the body such as nerves and bones come from the father while the soft and fluid parts of the body such as flesh and blood come from the mother. Instantly, Bhringi lost all flesh and blood and he became a bag of bones. He collapsed on the floor, unable to get up. Bhringi realized his folly. Shiva and Shakti make up the whole. They are not independent entities. One cannot exist without the other. Without either there is neither. He apologized. So the world never forgets this lesson. Bhringi was denied flesh and blood forever. To enable him to stand upright he was given a third leg, so that his legs served as a tripod.

Ayudhapurusha is the anthropomorphic depiction of a divine weapon in Hindu art. Ayudhapurushas are sometimes considered as partial incarnates of their divine owners.Anna L. Dallapiccola, ayudhapurusha or shastradevata. (2002). In Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend, Thames & Hudson. The sex of the personified weapon is determined by the gender of the weapon in the Sanskrit language.Rao p. 288 The suffix \\"purusha\\" (man) is added to masculine weapons and \\"devi\\" (goddess) to female ones. The weapons Shakti, Heti (a Hatchet-like weapon) and Gada (mace), especially Kaumodaki (the mace of Vishnu), Dhanus/Dhanushya (\\"bow\\") are women. Chakra, especially Vishnu's Sudarshana Chakra (discus of Vishnu), Shankha (\\"conch\\"), Padma (lotus), Ankusha (elephant goad), Pasha (noose), Trisula (trident), vajra (thunderbolt), Khadga (sword), Danda (a sceptre or club), Bana/Shara (\\"arrow\\") and Bhindi (sling) are depicted male. While weapons are personified in ancient Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the ayudhapurushas were depicted in sculpture starting from the Gupta era. They might be depicted as humans with the weapons against them or holding the weapon or with the weapon on their head or emerging from it. The most popular ayudhapurushas are associated with the god Vishnu and appear in his iconography. Textual references The first instance, where weapons are personified in Hindu scriptures, appears in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Two daughters of the Prajapati Daksha, Jaya and Vijaya are married to the sage Krisasva. For destruction of Rakshasas, Jaya bore fifty sons - powerful divine weapons who could take any form. Suprabha gave birth to fifty invincible sons who were called Samharas (\\"destroyers\\"). These magical weapons were known as Shastra-devatas ‚Äì the gods of weapons - and were given to king Kaushika, who later became the sage Vishwamitra. The weapons served him and later his pupil Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. The Mahabharata records at the time of the chakra-musala war, the weapons of Krishna ‚Äì another avatar of Vishnu and his brother Balarama appear in human form from the heavens to watch the battle. They include Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra and Kaumodaki, and Balarama's Samvartak plough and Saunanda musala (club). The Duta-Vakya (\\"envoy's message\\") of the Sanskrit playwright Bhasa (c. 2nd century BCE ‚Äì 2nd century CE) describes an episode from the Mahabharata when Krishna goes as an envoy to Kauravas' court to broker peace between them and their cousins the Pandavas, on behalf of the latter. However, when the Kauravas try to arrest Krishna, Krishna assumes his Vishvarupa (all pervading \\"Universal form\\") and summons his weapons, who appear as humans. The ayudhapurushas include the Sudarshana Chakra, the bow Saranga, Kaumodaki, Panchajanya the conch and Nandaka the sword, elaborate descriptions of whom are found in the text. This is the only Sanskrit play that depicts the weapons on stage as humans. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa mentions about dwarf-like ayudhapurushas denoting Vishnu's chakra, lotus, sword, bow and mace. Textual descriptions Sudarshana Chakra depicted as an ayudhapurusha and fierce aspect of his owner Vishnu. Treatises such as the Vishnudharmottara Purana and various Agamas describe the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black- complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja (\\"banner\\") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha is described as a white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black- complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.Rao pp. 289‚Äì90 While the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted as a subordinate figure with Vishnu, in many South Indian Vishnu temples, the Chakra as an ayudhapurusha is worshipped in its own shrine attached to the central temple. Here, the Chakra is regarded as an aspect of Vishnu and called Chakra-rupi Vishnu ‚Äì Vishnu in the form of the Chakra. In the outline of the ordinary circular Chakra with a hexagram inscribed in it (shat-kona-chakra) ‚Äì stands the personified Chakra in fierce form generally with eight arms. Often, Yoga-Narasimha, the lion-man ferocious aspect of Vishnu is depicted on the back of the Chakra sculpture. The Shilparatna describes that the fierce Chakra-rupi Vishnu should hold in his hands gada, chakra, a snake, a lotus, musala (a pestle), tramsha, pasha and ankusha. He is depicted as radiant as the sun and with protruding tusks from the sides of his mouth. Another description describes the Chakra as a sixteen-armed fierce form of Vishnu. He holds a chakra, shankha, bow, parashu, asi (sword), arrow, trishula, pasha, ankusha, agni (fire), khadga (sword), shield, hala (plough), musala, gada and kunta. Three-eyed and golden-coloured with protruding tusks, the Chakra stands in the shat-kona-chakra, with Narasimha on the reverse of the sculpture.Rao pp. 290‚Äì2 Sculptural depictions An ayudhapurusha is generally depicted as a two-armed figure, prescribed to shown with a karanda mukuta (conical crown). An ayudhapurusha may be depicted as a dwarf, concurring with Kalidasa's description in the Raghuvamsa. Such icons are present in Rajgir, Mahabalipuram and Badami. They may be depicted as normal humans as in Udayagiri Caves and in the Sheshashayi Vishnu panel of the Gupta era (320‚Äì550 CE) Deogarh temple. At Deogarh, the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted against the Chakra/wheel and the Kaumodaki holding a gada. In another instance, the ayudhapurushas are depicted without their weapons, though C. Sivaramamurti opines that there is enough evidence to identify them as ayudhapurushas. The human Chakrapurusha depicted against the Chakra is seen on the chakra-vikrama coin of the Gupta ruler Chandragupta II where the Chakrapurusha ‚Äì here denoting the wheel of sovereignty ‚Äì is dedicated bestowing the three pellets of sovereignty to the king. The Gupta era and medieval sculptures often depict the ayudhapurushas in normal human proportions. Chola and Chalukya sculptors continued the trend, mostly focussing on the Sudarshana Chakra in a fierce multiple-armed human form.C. Sivaramamurti pp. 128‚Äì30 Sometimes, the ayudhapurusha is depicted emerging from the associated weapon. In another variation, the ayushapurusha stands besides the deity with folded hands (in anjali mudra posture) with the weapon depicted on the head as part of the crown or the weapon mark on the forehead. The Sudarshana Chakra with the Chakra on his head in Deogarh and Chola era bronzes of Chakra and Gada in similar fashion are some illustrations.Rao pp. 288‚Äì9C. Sivaramamurti pp. 130‚Äì1 In the last variation of the ayudhapurusha iconography, he/she holds the associated weapon. Common examples are the Sudarshana Chakra, the Shankha-purusha and Kaumodaki, mostly found in Uttar Pradesh and Bengal art. Sharanga with the bow in his hand and Nandaka with the sword as in Deogarh are other examples. In some cases, the weapon may be depicted as in both anthropomorphic and their true form. While the central icon of Vishnu may hold the weapons, the ayudhapurushas of the same weapon may stand at the feet of the central icon.C.

It stars Brian Salsburg, Donna Dempsy, Stephen Charles Barry, and members of Merhige's theatre company Theatreofmaterial. The film contains no dialogue and mimics the style of aged black-and-white films. Its enigmatic plot, drawn from elements of various creation myths, opens with the suicide of a Godlike figure and the births of Mother Earth and the Son of Earth, who set out on a journey of death and rebirth through a barren landscape. According to art historian Scott MacDonald, the film's allegorical qualities and purposeful ambiguity invite multiple interpretations. Begotten was first conceived as an experimental theater piece with dance and live musical accompaniment, but Merhige switched to film after deciding that his vision would be too expensive to achieve as a production for live audiences. Antonin Artaud and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche were major influences on Begotten, as Merhige believed their ideas and theories had not been explored in film to their full extent. The film's visual style was inspired by Georges Franju's documentary short Blood of the Beasts, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Stan Brakhage's The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes, and the German Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Begotten was shot on location in New York and New Jersey over a period generally thought to have been three and a half years‚Äîalthough, in an interview, Merhige said filming took only five and a half months. Once the film was finished, Merhige spent the next two years trying to find a distributor willing to market it. Following its debut at the Montreal World Film Festival, it was screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, where it was seen by film critics Tom Luddy and Peter Scarlet. They brought it to the attention of fellow critic Susan Sontag, whose enthusiastic praise and private screenings of the film in her own home were instrumental to its eventual release. Though largely ignored by mainstream critics, it attained cult film status and influenced several avant-garde filmmakers, experimental artists, and musicians. The film's scarcity on home video prompted its fans to spread their own bootleg copies, a phenomenon described as a \\"copy-cult\\" by film studies scholar Ernest Mathijs. Begotten was reportedly banned in Singapore due to its violent content. As the first part of a planned series, Begotten was followed in 2006 by Din of Celestial Birds, a short sequel with the theory of evolution as its dominant theme. Plot Inside a small shack, a robed figure ‚Äîdubbed \\"God Killing Himself\\" in the film's credits‚Äî disembowels himself using a straight razor. After removing some of his internal organs, the character dies. A woman, Mother Earth, emerges from his mutilated remains. She brings the corpse to arousal and uses his semen to impregnate herself. Time passes and Mother Earth, now visibly pregnant, stands beside a coffin containing God's corpse. Wandering off into a vast and barren landscape, Mother Earth later gives birth to Son of Earth, a malformed convulsing man. He is soon abandoned by his mother, who leaves him to his own devices. After an untold period of time wandering across the barren landscape, the Son of Earth encounters a group of faceless nomads who seize him by his umbilical cord. Upon being captured, the Son of Earth begins to vomit organic pieces, which the nomads excitedly accept as gifts. They then throw the man into a fire pit, where he burns to death. Son of Earth is resurrected by Mother Earth, who comforts her newly reborn offspring before they continue together across the barren landscape. The nomads soon return and proceed to attack the Son of Earth as Mother Earth stands in a trance-like state. Turning their attention to her, the nomads knock her to the ground, rape her, and murder her as her son watches helplessly nearby. Once the nomads have left, a group of robed figures arrive to carry away Mother Earth's mutilated, disemboweled remains. The group returns to murder and disembowel her son, burying pieces of both mother and son into the crust of the earth. As time passes, the burial site soon becomes lush with flowers. Grainy photographs of God Killing Himself are shown. In the final scene, Mother Earth and her son appear in a flashback, this time wandering through a forest. Cast * Brian Salzburg as God Killing Himself: :A mysterious, robed entity who disembowels himself with a straight razor. He is also the father of Mother Earth and Son of Earth, the latter of which was born through artificial insemination. * Donna Dempsey as Mother Earth: :A female entity based on the earth deity of the same name. She is the mother of Son of Earth, whom she conceived via artificial insemination. * Stephen Charles Barry as Son of Earth (Flesh on Bone): :The deformed, convulsing son of Mother Earth and God Killing Himself. Barry would later reprise his role in the film's sequel, Din of Celestial Birds, which was also written and directed by Merhige. Members of Merhige's theater company Theatreofmaterial ‚Äì which included Adolpho Vargas, Arthur Streeter, Daniel Harkins, Erik Slavin, James Gandia, Michael Phillips, and Terry Andersen ‚Äì provided additional credits for other characters in the film such as the Nomads and Robed Figures. Themes Critics have identified several major themes in Begotten. In interviews, Merhige himself has acknowledged that he intentionally incorporated these themes into the film, while also inviting viewers to form their own interpretations of the film. Death and rebirth Several critics have noted that Begotten contains an underlying theme of death and rebirth, recurring throughout most of the director's works. In an interview with Marty Mapes of Movie Habit, Merhige stated, \\"I've always believed in the continuity of consciousness. I don't think the body dying means it's over. It just means that there's a transformation taking place. So what we call physical death is not something that I think is some sorrowful loss.\\" In her review of Merhige's third film Suspect Zero for the Los Angeles Times, Elaine Dutka noted that themes of death and rebirth, that appeared throughout the director's works might have been inspired by a near-death experience Merhige had suffered during his youth at age nineteen. Author and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir pointed out the film's ideas of suffering, death, and rebirth, as being exemplified in the Son of Earth's journey. As Muir noted, the character's mistreatment, through various means intentionally drew parallels to mankind's 'painful' toil and reshaping of the earth for the purpose of planting crops, which represented the bringing forth of life through suffering. Muir also pointed out the film's characters as visualized symbols of certain concepts of mankind and the earth itself, with the depictions of life, death, and renewal as representing the four seasons. Film and literary scholar William E.B. Verrone also noted these themes, pointing out that, as the viewers, we are encouraged to mourn the film's characters (father/mother/son) through the agony and torment inflicted upon them. Verrone further elaborates that through these depictions of death and violence, we are then symbolically \\"offered salvation\\" in its depiction of the blossoming flowers seen growing on their graves. In the book Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide, co-author Jason Wood noted that the film's \\"evocation of the body as the source of horror and decay\\" was redolent of surreal works by Luis Bu√±uel and early David Lynch. Wood also compared the film's grainy look and landscapes to the recurring themes of hopelessness and desolation in the works of Russian filmmaker Aleksandr Sokurov. Religion, mythology, and the occult the deity of the same name and Mary, mother of Jesus. Many critics have pointed out the film's incorporation of various religious and mythological themes and events from Christian, Celtic, and Slavic mythology including various Creation myths, Mother Earth, and other religious themes, on which the events that take place in the film are loosely based. Merhige, a firm believer in alchemy and hermeticism, has acknowledged that the film was deliberately arranged to appear as part of a mythology. According to film and literary scholar William E.B. Verrone, Begottens core storyline was a mixture of ancient mythologies that dealt with stories and themes, such as the birth of a divine entity and their subsequent suffering through various means, citing the film as \\"a cryptic passion play about Earth‚Äôs birth and torture\\". Verrone went on to explain that the film's highly symbolic and metaphorical plot was intended to evoke a response different than that offered in more traditional cinematic offerings. Art historian Scott MacDonald pointed out that the film's highly allegorical plot represents many of the popular attitudes towards both the origins of life and religion, which have been put forth over the span of several centuries. MacDonald also interpreted the film's plot as the death of god or deity, and the birth and rape of Nature. In their book Cult Cinema: An Introduction, film studies scholars Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton noted that the film \\"makes perhaps the most serious attempt to visualize elements of Dionysian orgiastic cultism in combination with Gnostic and pagan myths\\". Robert DiMatteo pointed out the film's ritualistic and religious aspects such as the idea of \\"God's eye\\". The film's opening sequence shares many similarities with various creation myths, specifically those in which life is generated from the corpse or dismemberment of an originator deity. Art historian Herbert S. Lindenberger felt that Merhige had reworked myths that social anthropologist and folklorist Sir James Frazer had published during the Victorian era. Lindenberger also noted the film's inclusion of themes taken from Christianity such as the \\"buried god\\", his resurrection, and the inclusion of god's mother. Janet Maslin of The New York Times categorized the film as a mixture of ancient mythologies, which were reworked in what she called \\"visceral, monstrously immediate terms\\". Film critic Richard Corliss from Time pointed out that it contained multiple references to Druidism. Corliss also noted the film's mixture of druidism with several biblical stories such as the Creation (Genesis), the Nativity, and Christ's torture/death. Influences Merhige was informed by the theories and ideas of Antonin Artaud and Friedrich Nietzsche, which in his opinion had not been developed on film to the fullest extent. His key cinematic influences included Munk, Eisenstein, and Bu√±uel. In a 1993 interview with art historian Scott MacDonald, Merhige also listed Georges Franju's documentary short Blood of the Beasts as an inspiration for the visual style of the film, as well as Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Stan Brakhage's The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes, and the German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The painters Bosch, Munch, and Goya were a major source of inspiration for Merhige, who said fine art had a more consequential influence on Begotten than cinema. Critics have identified a variety of other possible influences. Film critic Eric D. Snider has pointed out that David Lynch's Eraserhead might also have influenced the film's visual style. While comparing Begottens opening sequence to the eye slicing scene in Bu√±uel's Un Chien Andalou, Film Comments Robert DiMatteo also noted Dimitri Kirsanoff's M√©nilmontant, tribal art, ethnographic studies, Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre, as well as the paintings of Piero Francesca as possible influences on the film. Production=Development and pre-production Begotten was written, produced, and directed by Merhige, with development for the film beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s, although some sources list the date as 1984. Merhige had studied at New York State University, and soon developed an interest in the theater after attending several performances while in Manhattan. Merhige would later state in an interview that he had been drawn towards the use of performers creating a highly visualized form of storytelling through dramatic movement to provoke, what Merhige called, \\"an otherworldly response\\". He was particularly fascinated by a Japanese dance troupe called Sankai Juku which, the director later learned, consisted of a handful of core members that were well in tune with one another, knowing each other completely on both a professional and personal level. Wanting to accomplish a similar group dynamic, Merhige founded Theatreofmaterial, a small theater production company based in New York City. After working on several different experimental theater productions, he began developing his next project, which was initially for the theater. As Merhige would later recall, the initial concept for the film was envisioned as a dance production at the Lincoln Center, which would have been set to a live orchestra. It was only after discovering that it would cost a quarter of a million dollars to produce that the decision was made to adapt the script for a motion picture instead of a theater production. Merhige also wanted to document the company's work, as many of its members were transitioning to other projects. Interviewed in 2013 by Fangoria, Merhige revealed that the film itself had also been an attempt to document many of the thoughts and ideas he was going through at the time, believing that if he did not \\"get it out there\\" they would overwhelm him. Still only twenty at the time, he wrote the film's script in six months. Before working on Begotten, he had previously made several short films such as Implosion (1983), Spring Rain (1984), and A Taste of Youth (1985). These were well-received, and gave the director the experience and insight he needed while working on Begotten. Merhige developed the film's script with members of Theatreofmaterial, who worked as both cast and crew during production. They decided that the film should be silent and that they would strive to evoke what the director called \\"emotions on the fringes\\", which they felt were avoided by most directors and artists. In preparation for writing the script, Merhige and members from Theatreofmaterial performed intense, ritualistic breathing exercises as a group. As Merhige explained, \\"We would breathe to the point of hysteria and create these moments of panic. Afterwards, we would analyze what the experience was all about. It was an intimate science.\\" He brought portions of the script to the cast members and began a process of rehearsals followed by group discussion and reflection on the material as it took shape. Over a period of four-and-a-half months, the group gradually translated the script's abstract ideas into more concrete, enactable scenes, though Merhige emphasized that the rehearsals were focused on group cohesion rather than precise choreography. Merhige later revealed to UltraCulture host Jason Louv that he strove to imbue the film with the same ritualistic and tribal aspects associated with alchemical and hermetic traditions. To that end he worked closely with the film‚Äôs cast, experimenting with various techniques such as hypnosis and meditation in order to help the cast achieve a mental state of what he called \\"universal stream\\" rather than having the actors simply mimic those aspects. Filming Principal photography took place in the mid-to- late 1980s, over a period of three-and-a-half months in several different locations. Merhige filled multiple roles in the film's production, including work on cinematography, and special effects, the latter using a 16mm Arriflex camera on black-and-white reversal film. He had previously worked on several short film subjects before developing Begotten. The opening sequence depicting the robed figure (listed in the credits as \\"God Killing Himself\\") disemboweling himself and Mother Earth emerging from his remains was the first to be shot. The sequence was then edited and shown to the cast and crew, whose reactions to the footage was very enthusiastic, with Merhige stating: \\"it proved to everyone that this was an important film, that there really was nothing else like it, and we were actually going to make it happen.\\" Most of the cast and crew were paid little to nothing, with their forms of payment being free room and board, and Merhige himself paying for all of their expenses. In his book Film Out of Bounds: Essays and Interviews on Non- Mainstream Cinema Worldwide, film historian Matthew Edwards cited Begotten as an example of low-budget films outside of Hollywood which displayed unique flair and artistry that rivaled most Hollywood productions, in spite the fact that they were made under a very low budget. A majority of the film was shot at a construction site on the border between New York City and New Jersey, where Merhige had been given permission to shoot for a period of twenty days when construction crews were not working. Members of the construction site would occasionally lend the film crew a hand by constructing landscapes when certain shots of mountains were needed during a scene. Scenes involving time- lapses of sunrises and sunsets were shot by the director, who spent a couple of days alone in the mountains near Santa Fe or Albuquerque. Funding for the film came from Merhige's grandfather, who had set Merhige up with a trust fund for medical school. Additional costs were paid by Merhige from income he received while working multiple jobs as a special effects artist. Merhige described working on the film as being a powerful, almost ceremonial experience that \\"changed the lives of all those involved\\" with the project. Post-production and visual effects processing through an optical printer. Each minute of the film required eight to ten hours of labor to process. Before Begotten, Merhige had worked as a special effects designer for various companies, including a brief job for a Disney television series that involved rotoscoping. These jobs had provided him with the technical knowledge‚Äîand savings‚Äîhe needed to handle the film's post-production and visual effects on his own. The visuals have a decayed look, as if the film itself were an artifact that has been damaged and degraded over vast stretches of time; Merhige said Before and during the film's shooting, he had experimented with the reel to give it an old, withered look. In one such experiment, he ran the unexposed negative against sandpaper to scratch its surface before shooting. Unsatisfied with the results, Merhige decided to use an optical printer for further processing. The \\"rephotography\\" removed almost all of the gray midtones from the footage's visible spectrum, leaving only extreme contrasts of black and white. He was unable to find an optical printer priced within his budget, so he built one himself. He constructed the printer over a period of eight months with spare parts from camera stores and special effects houses where he had worked before. The process proved to be time- consuming. Each minute of footage generated by the optical printer took between eight to ten hours to complete. Once a test shot was sent to the lab for development, minuscule mistakes in calibration would sometimes ruin the shot and require the process to start all over again. Merhige began asking labs if they would be willing to adjust their usual development procedures to his custom specifications, but was repeatedly turned away. Eventually he found a small studio willing to accommodate his requests: Kin-O-Lux Labs, located on Manhattan's 48th Street and owned by a German-American √©migr√© named Fred Schreck. Merhige quickly developed a friendship with Schreck, who allowed the director to use the lab to develop the footage while teaching him how to develop footage by hand. Schreck's name appears under \\"special thanks\\" in the film's end credits. At one point during the editing process, Merhige enlisted his father's input on certain scenes, stating that his father was \\"very open- minded\\" to the project. Merhige used similar \\"rephotography\\" techniques for segments of his next film, Shadow of the Vampire. Soundtrack Begotten contains no dialogue. Merhige envisioned \\"a time that predates spoken language\\", in which \\"communication is made on a sensory level.\\" The film's soundtrack - including sound effects and music - was composed and mixed by Evan Albam. Merhige hired Albam on the recommendation of Tim McCann, the film's assistant director. Albam had a job painting houses at the time and, prior to Begotten, composed only in his spare time. Merhige and Albam worked together closely in order to find the right balance of visual and audio cues. The soundtrack took a year to complete. The music is ambient and dirge-like, and the sound design is fleshed out by natural sounds such as bird calls, insect noises, and the sounds of a heartbeat. Release=Distribution Once editing for Begotten was completed, Merhige spent two years trying to find a distributor willing to market and release it. Merhige screened the film to possible distributors but most refused to release the film as it did not fit into a specific genre, making it difficult to bring the film to market. Merhige later recalled, \\"When I first went looking for distribution, everyone laughed at me, saying 'We don't know what this is...'\\" Merhige then took it to a number of museums in hopes of eventually finding a distributor. In the end, only two showed any interest, but both were turned down by Merhige who felt that they would not have been the right choice. As a result, Merhige became very protective of the film, only showing it to people he felt he could trust. Through these private screenings, film critics Tom Luddy and Peter Scarlet would eventually view the film, becoming fascinated by its distinct visual style. Although uncertain how the film would be received, Luddy and Scarlet were able to put together several screenings of the film at the San Francisco International Film Festival, before showing the film to fellow critic Susan Sontag. Sontag, who set up a private screening at her home for twenty of her closest friends, would become one of the Begottens leading advocates and instrumental for its eventual theatrical release. Sontag later brought a copy of the film to the Berlin Film Festival where she informally screened it to interested cin√©astes, proclaiming it to be an artistic masterpiece. During one of Sontag's screenings, it was supposedly viewed by director Werner Herzog, whom Merhige later claimed that Herzog was \\"very supportive of the film\\". Theatrical screenings The US premiere of Begotten occurred at the 1990 San Francisco International Film Festival, where it was screened at the Japantown Kabuki8 multiplex (pictured in 2005). Unable to find a distributor, Begotten did not attain either wide or limited theatrical release. However it became a popular underground film, as a film released outside of conventional commercial channels, especially one with subversive or transgressive content. Lacking a standard theatrical release, Merhige booked one-off screenings at various film festivals and art museums. The earliest public screening took place at the Goethe-Institut in Montreal on October 24, 1989, as part of the Montreal World Film Festival. It had three screenings from May 5‚Äì7 at the 1990 San Francisco International Film Festival, marking its premiere in the United States. It also premiered later that year in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, on October 22nd with Merhige introducing the film, followed by a post- screening discussion with the audience. New York City's Film Forum would also screen the film on June 5, 1991. It was exhibited at the Stadtkino Theater in Vienna in 1992, as a part of a retrospective of American independent cinema titled \\"Unknown Territories\\". It screened at the Berlin Film Festival in the early to mid 1990s, and on October 20, 2014, was shown at Brooklyn's Spectacle Theater as a part of its fourth annual \\"Spectober\\" film event. The film appeared at the third annual horror film festival SpectreFest on October 28, 2015 along with its spiritual sequel Din of Celestial Birds followed by an onstage discussion with Merhige. The film was shown at the Music Box Theatre in Midtown Manhattan on September 25, 2016, during its 25th Anniversary celebration, where it was screened from Merhige's personal 16mm print. It was viewed as a double-feature alongside the director's other film Shadow of the Vampire, and was followed by a Q&A; with Merhige. The film was later screened at the Short Film Festival in London on January 8, 2017, where it was shown again in its original 16mm format, accompanied by a live music score from the film. It was screened on October 17, 2019 at the Rice Media Center, as part of a celebration of \\"Low-Fi\\" Analog film series. Home media and bootlegging Begotten was released on VHS in 1995. It is currently out of print, though widely bootlegged. Begotten has received very limited home media distribution after its theatrical release. The film is out of print and difficult to acquire in secondhand markets. Initially, Merhige did not intend for the film to be released on home video at all, stating in an interview with Scott MacDonald that he had previously hated the concept of home video as a medium. Merhige eventually changed his mind and felt that the original soundtrack mix, with which he had not been completely satisfied, could be enhanced through the medium. The film was briefly released on VHS by World Artists Home Video on March 10, 1995. It was later given a very limited DVD release by World Artists on February 20, 2001 and included a souvenir booklet, the original theatrical trailer, rare and never-before-seen movie stills, and production photos. World Artists' DVD release of the film was listed by Film Comments Gavin Smith at No. #9 in his \\"Top 10 DVD Picks\\". This edition of the film has long been out of print. Due to the film's severely limited availability on home media, its fans began to spread it through bootleg copies and digital piracy. The circulation of unlicensed copies has almost certainly overtaken legitimate distribution in volume. The film is typically encountered via ambiguously legal methods, a situation which‚Äîaccording to Mathijs and Sexton‚Äîfostered a \\"copy-cult\\" that enhanced its cult status. The film was reportedly banned in Singapore due to its graphic and disturbing content. On July 29, 2016, Merhige announced via Instagram that the film would be released for the first time on Blu-ray in the Fall of that year. However, the distribution deal fell through and a second announcement, during its 25th-anniversary screening alongside Shadow of the Vampire at Music Box Theatre in Midtown Manhattan, did not provide a release date either. Reception=Critical reception Susan Sontag was one of the main advocates for Begotten and helped ensure the film's release. Begotten has received little to no attention from film critics, with most mainstream reviewers ignoring the film entirely. Merhige was initially afraid that audiences would misunderstand parts, or the entire film altogether, \\"When I finished the film, I felt sure it would be misunderstood and consigned to the underground again. I see it as a very serious, very beautiful work of art, but when it was first finished, I was always thinking, 'What if everybody just laughs? What if they don't see anything in it?' There is always that possibility.\\" Reactions to the film upon its release were extremely polarized, but Merhige has stated that he remains grateful for starting his career with the film. The limited reviews on the film have been mixed to positive, with some critics calling it a masterpiece, praising the film's unique visual style, and resonating themes; others have criticized these same merits along with its brutal violence and running time. Susan Sontag‚Äîone of the leading advocates for the film‚Äîpraised it, referring to it as \\"a metaphysical splatter film\\" and \\"one of the 10 most important films of modern times\\". Marc Savlov from the Austin Chronicle called the film \\"Experimental, haunting, dreamlike, and intentionally confounding\\", also citing that the film's grainy visuals, and horrific imagery as having an influence on the VHS sequences in The Ring series, and the works of Guy Madden. Adrian Halen from Horror News.net gave the film a positive review, stating the film's use of symbolism from Christianity and Egyptian mythology, as well as the ambiguity of what was displayed on the screen, created a unique viewing experience that was admittedly not always easy to digest. Jonathan Rosenbaum at the Chicago Reader called it a \\"remarkable if extremely upsetting\\" film, praised the originality of its visuals, but cautioned that \\"squeamish\\" viewers \\"should avoid this like the plague\\". David Sterritt from The Christian Science Monitor offered the film similar praise, stating that the film 'strongly recalls the work of Samuel Beckett's stark novel How It Is. Sterritt also noted the film's claustrophobic feelings, and dark narrative, calling it 'a disturbing, yet entrancing experience'. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B+, praising the film's visual aesthetic, and comparing the film's graphic imagery to paintings by Francis Bacon. Reviewing Film Forum's 1991 screening, Joe Kane of the New York Daily News, while stating that he felt the film would have been more effective at a shorter running time, he praised the film's minimalist soundtrack, visuals, and its subversion of traditional narrative structure. Mexican film critic Marco Gonz√°lez Ambriz called the film \\"magnificent\\" and a must-see \\"for anyone interested in the cinematic avant-garde\\", although he also noted that many viewers would likely find the film unbearable. Reviewing the film for arts and culture magazine Film Comment gave the film significant praise, calling the opening sequence \\"a triumph of lyrical grotesquerie\\", and compared the film to the avant-garde works of Maya Deren, and Stan Brakhage. The film was not without its detractors. Author and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir awarded the film a mixed rating of two and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it \\"an experimental, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience\\". In his review, Muir praised the film's originality and powerful imagery, while criticizing the running time as being too long. Janet Maslin from The New York Times criticized the film for being too grotesque, writing \\"Mr. Merhige's concentration, while impressive in its way, seems almost entirely self- contained, with little effort to engage an audience on even the level of myth.\\" Legacy Begotten has gradually developed a cult following over the years and is considered by some to be the director's masterpiece. It was listed in the 2011 book 100 Cult Films by Ernest Mathijs and Xavier Mendik over Mendik's objections, as he felt its following was too small to merit inclusion. However, it ultimately made it in because, to Mathijs, its following represented \\"the real sectarian cult; it's a very small committed group of people. It's like a secret handshake that goes worldwide. If you've seen Begotten, you're in that cult.\\" Begotten has been included in multiple lists at various media outlets. In 2012, Complex included the film on its list of 50 Most Disturbing Movies. Sarah Gibson from Highsnobiety listed it in her 10 of the Most Damaged and Disturbing Movies Ever Made. It was placed at #10 on AskMen's 10 Hard-To-Stomach Horror Movies, stating that the film was \\"so miserable that it likely wouldn't have seen the light of day were it not for Susan Sontag\\". Taste of Cinema.com listed it at #13 in its 20 Most Disturbing Movies of All Time, summarizing, \\"Begotten possesses a haunting, atmospherically visceral quality that has yet to be surpassed... Combine Merhige's avant-garde film style with sequences of torture and unsettling imagery, and you get one of the most shocking experimental pictures of all time.\\" It was placed at #4 on Nylon's \\"8 Most Disturbing Horror Films Ever Made\\". In his article \\"10 Horror Movies Too Intense Even for Halloween\\", ScreenRants Jason Wojnar ranked the film at #8, citing its unsettling imagery, unconventional narrative, and visual style \\"makes it hard to tell what is even happening during the unsettling events.\\" Entertainment Weekly included the film in its \\"13 of the Most Disturbing ‚Äî and Critically Acclaimed ‚Äî Movies to Ever Hit Theaters\\", describing it as \\"kind of like if Alejandro Jodorowsky told the story of creation filtered through the lens of Eraserhead.\\" In his 2014 book Disorders of Magnitude: A Survey of Dark Fantasy, author Jason V. Brock listed the film as his seventh favorite work of radio, film, or television production. Several sources have mistakenly reported that Time ranked Begotten in its top-ten list of either 1990 or 1991, but the film was not included either year. The film's critical success provided a foundation for Merhige to continue his filmmaking career. He went on to direct the critically acclaimed Shadow of the Vampire and the less well-received Suspect Zero. Nicolas Cage, a co-producer of Shadow of the Vampire, advocated hiring Merhige to direct the project based on his positive impression of Begotten. Merhige was later hired by singer Marilyn Manson to direct music videos for his songs \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"Cryptorchid\\", the latter utilizing imagery that was heavily incorporated from Begotten. Manson was a huge admirer of Begotten, which he called \\"one of the strangest and scariest films I've seen\\", and had personally contacted Merhige to ask him if he would be willing to direct the music video for his song \\"Cryptorchid\\". Manson has stated that Begotten was played on a loop during the entire recording for his album Antichrist Superstar. The music video for \\"Cryptorchid\\" premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1997 where it won a Golden Gate Certificate of Merit Award. It was subsequently barred from release by Interscope Records, whom Manson claimed were \\"appalled by it\\", due to its fascist iconography, namely the Nuremberg rallies, along with U.S. military footage and images of a Ku Klux Klan lynching. \\"Cryptorchid\\" was also beset with troubles and remained unreleased until it was leaked on YouTube in 2010. Merhige has since become a prominent member of the theatre, directing numerous stage plays which include A Dream Play, an adaption of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Waiting for Godot. Din of Celestial Birds Merhige considers Begotten the first entry in an incomplete trilogy. It is followed by the 14-minute short film Din of Celestial Birds. As with Begotten, Merhige fulfilled multiple roles during its production, functioning as the writer, director, and producer. Din of Celestial Birds was funded with assistance from the Q6 production group, a collective of philosophers and artists. His principal inspiration for Din of Celestial Birds came from silent films such as Jean Cocteau's Blood of a Poet (1930), Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), and the works of the Lumi√®re brothers. He intended the short as a depiction of \\"creation in its simplest and purest form\\". Focusing on the theory of evolution instead of religion and mythology, the film opens with the text that reads: \\"Hello and welcome ... do not be afraid ... be comforted ... remember ... our origin...\\", followed by images depicting the Big Bang. Then, after a hyper-accelerated trip through the evolution of life and the Earth, it culminates in the birth of an embryonic pseudo-humanoid called the Son of Light (Stephen Charles Barry) that reaches to some unknown source. Din of Celestial Birds premiered on Turner Classic Movies on September 15, 2006. It was later screened alongside its predecessor at the SpectreFest Film Festival in 2015. Influence Since its release, Begotten has become a minor influence on several avant-garde and experimental films, and has been cited by several artists as inspiration for some of their works. Michael Pope's acclaimed 2001 experimental film Neovoxer has been compared to Begotten, featuring a similar visual style and \\"impressionistic mythology\\". According to Panos Cosmatos the flashback sequences in his 2010 film Beyond the Black Rainbow were directly inspired by Begotten. When interviewed by SmellsLikeScreenSpirit.com, Cosmatos stated that he had wanted the flashback sequences to 'have the look and feel of an artifact that was in the process of deterioration', and Begottens visual style was the perfect look for these sequences. Kyle Turner from Mubi.com compared the 2015 experimental film Ville Marie as being very similar to Merhige's film in terms of cinematic style, and use of reverse-exposure. Certain scenes in Can Evrenol's 2015 surrealist horror film Baskin were compared to Begotten. In an interview with Muzzeland Press, visual artist and musician Rob Stanley cited the film's dark imagery as one of the influences for his artwork. James Quinn's 2017 experimental horror film Flesh of the Void was noted by several critics as being similar to Merhige's film in style and narrative. However, Quinn himself stated, in an interview with Nightmare on Film Street, that he felt his film did not fall into the same category. Certain scenes from Blake Williams' 2018 avant-garde science fiction film Prototype were compared to Begotten by Glenn Kenny of The New York Times. Jimmy Joe Roche's 2018 experimental short film, Skin of Man, was also said to have been influenced by Begotten. The film's influence has also extended into the music world. American music artist Zola Jesus listed the film as a major inspiration for her 2017 music album Okovi, revealing in an interview with ARTNews that during development of the album, she would play the film on loop in order to help with Okovis audio and visual aesthetic. For their experimental musical composition Frankenstein Bemshi! at the 2018 Rochester Fringe Festival, performers Dave Esposito and G. E. Schwartz mixed portions of Begotten with the 1910 film Frankenstein, accompanied by live guitar music, electronic soundscapes, spoken narration, and with poetry added as text to the movie's image. Lead singer Dimitri Giannopoulos, from the American rock band Horse Jumper Of Love, revealed that the single \\"Airport\\", from their 2019 album So Divine, was partially inspired by Begotten.

During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain- fortress.The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.190 He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign.  Battle of Koppam  The Chola forces were in battle with the Chalukyan army at Koppam (Koppal) located on the Tungabhadra River in 1053‚Äì54 AD.Ancient Indian History and Civilization, page 384The Cambridge Shorter History of India, page 190 Rajadhiraja was personally leading the Chola army from atop a war elephant to help rally the retreating Cholas. Prince Rajendra, the younger brother of Rajadhiraja, was holding himself in reserve. The Chalukyan army then concentrated on the elephant on which the Chola king was riding and wounded him mortally. Seeing the emperor falling dead, the Chola army retreated in disarray.Ancient Indian History and Civilization von Sailendra Nath Sen p.384 At that stage Rajendra entered the fray. Once again the Chalukya army concentrated on the leader. Rajendra-II was as valorous as his brave father and was a born leader of men. He immediately sensed that with the death of their King Rajadhiraja-I, the Chola army was in a disarray, he announced his taking over as the next Chola monarch and ordered the capable Chola army to continue fighting without letting up.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen: p.384 His unparalleled response and restoration of order by deciding to lead from the front on the battlefield simply re- galvanized his army which had among its ranks, several generals serving the Chola army from the times of Raja Raja I and Rajendra Chola I. He had many nephews and . Needless to add, the Chalukya army was simply unprepared for this kind of a reaction from any army which had lost its original leader and were simply no match. From inscriptions of Rajendra-II, we know that his elder brother Rajadhiraja-I was killed in the battle at Koppam in which Rajendra-II had participated along with his other brothers. Even Rajendra-II had been injured initially and had withdrawn from the battle, but he came back and turned the tables on the Ahavamalla (Someshvara-I, who called himself 'Trailokyamalla' ‚Äì lord of three worlds). From an inscriptions of his from Manimangalam we understand that at the end of the battle, the Chalukyas were defeated and a number of officers of their army lay dead on the field. In this battle multiple opponents viz. Jaysinghan, the younger brother of the Salukki, Pulikesi, Dasapanman etc., were killed by Rajendradeva.South Indian Inscriptions: Miscellaneous inscriptions in Tamil (4 pts. in 2), page 62 Kollapuram is identified with Kolhapur in present-day Maharashtra.The early history of the Deccan, Volume 1, page 327 Based upon other inscriptions of Rajendra, historian Hultzsch has proposed that the Kollapuram war was an earlier expedition, in which Rajendra had participated under his elder brother Rajdhiraja.The C≈ç·∏∑as, page 279 This view is also held by a few other historians who credit the burning of Kalyanapuram, the capital of the Chalukyas and the planting of victory at Kollapuram, again two separate events, to Rajadhiraja Chola I.The ChƒÅlukyas of KalyƒÅ·πáa and the Kalachuris, page 172  Accession  Gangai Konda Cholapuram Rajendra-II, who had been nominated by his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola I as heir apparent over his own children, proclaimed himself king on the Koppam battlefield after his victory. It is to be noted however the above version of the Koppam battle is found only in the Chola inscriptions. Chalukyan contemporary chroniclers are silent on this battle. A Chalukyan account of the battle is only found in a later inscription dated c. 1071, which recounts this incident after a gap of almost 15 years and which only mentions the death of Rajadhiraja. Later Chola poetic works Kalingathuparani and Vikramcholan Ula describe this battle in great detail.  Further Chalukyan Battles  Chalukyas, anxious to wipe out the disgrace of Koppam, invaded the Chola country in great force c 1062 C.E. The armies met at the Muddakaru river (at the junction of the Tungabhadra and the Krishna river). The Chalukya commander Dandanayaka Valadeva was killed and the Cholas led by Rajamahendra resisted the invasion. Virarajendra Chola was also present in the battle fighting at the side of Rajamahendra. The Western Chalukyan expedition to take Vengi was also thwarted by the Cholas at the same battlefield. Subsequently, Someshwara-I also engaged the Chola army under Rajendra-II and Virarajendra at Kudalasangamam, the result was yet another heavy defeat for the Chalukyan king. Patron of Art When he was a co-regent of his elder brother, Rajadhiraja Chola I, he shared the latter's workload by taking care of the internal affairs of the state. He was a great patron of dance and theatre and we know of several occasions where he encouraged various artists and poets. For example, he passed a royal order in the 4th year of his reign to provide paddy and other ration to Santi Kuttan Tiruvalan Tirumud Kunran alias Vijaya Rajendra Acharyan(named after Rajadhiraja) for enacting RajaRajeswara Natakam (a musical), in the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Thanjavur.Bharatanatyam, the Tamil heritage, page 42Middle Chola temples: Rajaraja I to Kulottunga I (A.D. 985‚Äì1070), page 266 Accordingly, the dancer was to get 120 Kalam paddy for this purpose and that he and his descendants were to perform the musical regularly during the annual festival.Archaeology and art: Krishna Deva felicitation volume, Part 2, page 554 Family A number of his relatives are known to us from an record of his from the fourth year of his reign. These are a paternal uncle, four younger brothers, six sons and two grandsons. One of these younger brothers was Virarajendra Chola on whom he conferred the title Karikala solan. Other titles conferred on the members of the royal family by the king include Chola-Pandyan, Chola-Gangan, Chola-Ayodhyarajan and Chola-Kanyakubjan. According to historian Nilakanta Sastri, these titles denoted the provinces that were administered by these Chola princes. Conquests Rajendra-II like his predecessors already had control of the Pandyan kingdom. After vanquishing the Chalukya Someshvara I, he undertook a further expedition to the Kalinga Kingdom as well as to Ilangai (Sri Lanka) whose king Manabharanan was aided by the Kalinga King Vira Salamegha. He also had under his control other provinces such as Ayodhya, Kanyakubja, Rattapadi, Kadaram. In Kalinga war, the king of Kalinga was killed and the two sons of Manabharanan were captured.

During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students.South Indian Shrines: Illustrated by P. V. Jagadisa Ayyar p.23 A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign.History of Ancient India by Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar p.127 Virarajendra‚Äôs reign falls in a period of the medieval Cholas, when it was both trying to expand its boundaries and preserve its existing territories, but had appeared to stutter in its attempts because of the death, in his prime, of the eldest brother and king Rajadhiraja-I and the short rule of Virarajendra's elder brother Rajendra-II. In total, the three brothers ruled for 16-20 years altogether by succeeding one another.Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1935) This rapid succession was seen as a golden opportunity by the traditional enemies and subordinates of the Cholas, viz. the Singhalas (Ceylon), Pandyas and even the Chera Perumals, with each adversary either trying to become free or declaring a war on the Cholas. Ultimately, however, Virarajendra proved to be a very capable and brave ruler, who was kind and protective to his subjects, reimposed authority on Chola dominions and was particularly ruthless to the old nemeses of the Cholas, both the Chalukyas and the Pandyas. Viewed overall, especially in the context of the fact that his own rule lasted for less than 10 years, yet, as borne out by his various inscriptions in Karur, Virarajendra's was a lasting legacy in that in the short time he ruled, he overwhelmed everyone of his adversaries, and succeeded not only in preserving Chola territories, but also made overseas concquests in far-off lands like Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nicobar, Sakkarakottam (around Bastar district, Chhattisgarh - this was also a place governed by the next major Chola monarch, Kulothunga-I or Rajendra Chalukya, son of Eastern Chalukya King Rajaraja Narendra and thus grandson of Rajendra Chola I through his daughter Ammangadevi. Early life He was posted as the Chola viceroy of Sri Lanka by his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola during the early part of the latter's reign.Mysore gazetteer, Volume 2, Issue 2, page 1055The Cholas: mathematics reconstructs the chronology, page 55 Next, during the reign of his other elder brother Rajendra Chola II, he served as the Lord of Uraiyur. Military Conflicts Virarajendra fought many battles against the Western Chalukya Empire, the main catalyst for these conflicts being the Chola interest in the Vengi Chalukyas. He fought the Western Chalukyas near Visaiyavadai (modern Vijayawada) and routed the Western Chalukyas on the banks of the river Krishna and re-asserted Chola authority over the domains of the Eastern Chalukyas[*]. He also invaded Singhala Nadu (Ceylon) and ruthlessly crushed attempts of the Singhala kings to free their kingdom from Chola control[*]. Early Battles During the early period of his reign, Virarajendra fought and killed the king of Pottapi, and king of the Kerala (Chera Perumal) country. He also had to suppress a rebellion in the Pandya territories by the Pandya princes[*]. While these battles were progressing, the Western Chalukya Someshvara I invaded the Chola country, who probably was fooled into thinking that with a new king at helm, the Chola country was there for his taking and he thought he could overcome his earlier humiliation at the hands of Virarajendra's predecessor, Rajendra-II. First, Someshvara-I sent his son Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI) for plundering Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the capital of Virarajendra. Virarajendra was returning after subduing the Pandyas, the Sinhalas and the Chera Perumal kings and making them tribute paying subordinates[*]. He immediately undertook the task of safeguarding the Chola capital and routed Vikramaditya VI from the Chola capital. Next he chased the Chalukya princes Vikramaditya (Vikkalan) and Singhanan at Gangapadi. He completely overwhelmed the Chalukya army led by both princes and sons of Someshvara-I and proceeded to the Chalukyan capital. There he routed for the first time Someshvara-I who fled the battlefield.History of Ancient India by Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar p.127 The third war fought by Virarajendra against the Chalukyas was when Someshvara-I sent his son Vikramaditya VI to occupy Vengi on the presumption that due to the death of his old nemesis Rajendra-II, Vengi could be made subordinate to Western Chalukya rule. Virarajendra's armies routed the Western Chalukyas at Vengi, after which they surrounded Kalyanpura, the Chalukyan capital and burnt the fortress at Kampili taking precious wealth, the Chief queen of Someshvara-I, eliminated his generals and trusted feudatories and took away his horses and prized elephants. Virarajendra successfully quelled the rebellions at Ceylon, Madurai and the Chera Perumal Kingdom, Potappi and converted the Western Chalukyas (at the seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi) into tribute paying subordinates[*]. Continuing Chalukya Battles Virarajendra‚Äôs reign is marked by the numerous inscriptions detailing his various victories with the Western Chalukyas. Virarajendra was involved in the battles against the Western Chalukyas even before he became king. Under the command of the then heir to the throne Rajamahendra, Virarajendra fought the Chalukya forces in the battle of Mudakaru.A military history of medieval India by Gurcharn Singh Sandhu p.144 During Virarajendra‚Äôs reign, Someshvara, the loser of this battle sought to wipe the disgrace of his defeat at Madukaru and called for battle with the Cholas. On each of the confrontations with the Cholas, Someshvara-I not only disgracefully ran away from the battlefields, but also allowed many of his generals or Mahasamantas and Dandanayakas to become sitting ducks at the hands of the Chola kings. In his inscriptions at Karur and Tindivanam, Virarajendra claims proudly that Someshvara-I's sons Vikramaditya-VI (called Vikkalan) and Jayasimha-III (called Singhanan) fled the battlefield with dishevelled hair.[**] Virarajendra further claimed that he defeated Someshvara-I's armies not less than five times. These battles took place at Kudalasangamam, Gangaikondacholapuram, Karur, Kampili and Vengi. On each occasion, the generals of Someshvara-I like Chamundaraja were beheaded, Maduvana, Vikramaditya VI fled the battlefield with 'disshevelled hair', Jayasimha-III, Annala and finally Ahavamalla Someshvara-I too fled the battle shaming themselves permanently. In another war, it was the time of Someshvara-I's second son, Someshvara-II to be expelled from Kannada country itself. Each time Someshvara-I tried to wipe out the previous disgrace, he was repeatedly routed in war and shamed even more with him losing not just his kingdom but even his wives, treasures, horses, elephants etc. ending up in possession of the Chola King[++]. Each time Someshvara-I lost, he had to sue for peace and became a tribute paying subordinate of Virarajendra. Someshvara-I took one final chance and called Virarajendra for battle. Someshvara I wrote the Chola king assigning a site in a place called Kudal Sangamam for the battle, ironically near the site of the previous battle in which the Chalukya forces were so utterly defeated. Receiving this message, Virarajendra immediately set out for the battle and camped near Kandai for the Chalukyan army to arrive.The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.190 The exact date set for the battle, according to Virarajendra‚Äôs inscription found at Manimangalam, was Monday, 10 September 1067 C.E.[*][++] The Chola army awaited the expected battle for more than a month; the Chalukya king never met the appointment. The Chola army then devastated the surrounding countryside, erected a pillar of victory on the banks of the Tungabhadra River[*][++]. There is no verifiable and known reason for Someshvara‚Äôs inability to face the Cholas at Kudala Sangama. There was a running succession feud between his first son and chosen heir, Someshvara-II and Vikramaditya-VI. Apparently, Vikramaditya-VI did not want to fight for his father. In fact as per the inscription of Virarajendra at Perumber, after the expulsion of Someshvara-II from Kannada country, it seems that the greedy Vikramaditya-VI fell at the feet of Virarajendra and 'handed' him the entire 'seven and a half lakshas' of Rattapadi (Chalukyan Kingdom, ostensibly, he resented Someshvara-II being the heir to Someshvara-I and not himself). Virarajendra immediately nominated Vikramaditya-VI as the heir to the Chalukya throne and also gave his daughter in marriage to him on extracting the promise that his daughter's son will succeed Vikramaditya-VI as the next Chalukya King.[++] Surely, the above developments would have discouraged the already disgraced Someshvara-I even further. Whatever may be the reason, Someshvara and he committed suicide by drowning himself in March 1068 C.E. But Virarajendra's records say that the Salukki hid himself in the western sea, which indicates the probability of Someshvara-I having been drowned in the Arabian sea while running away from the Cholan army. This was in sharp contrast to Virarajendra's predecessor Rajadhiraja who lost his life in the battlefield while fighting the enemy. From Kudal Sangamam, the Chola army proceeded to Vengi to re-establish their control on the Eastern Chalukyan Kingdom. The raiders from Western Chalukya (some sources say that Someshvara-I had sent his son Vikramaditya VI (Vikkalan) and a senior trusted General to capture Vengi and install a puppet ruler subordinate to Someshvara-I. In a battle on the banks of the Krishna River, near Visaiyavadai or modern Vijayawada ++, Virarajendra crushed the Western Chalukya army led by Jananatha. Virarajendra then proceeded to conquer the entire Eastern Chalukya kingdom, defeated and re-captured Kalinga whose king had been in alliance with the Western Chalukyas. Virarajendra installed Vijayaditya, the Eastern Chalukya prince on the Vengi throne. War in Lanka Vijayabahu, the Sinhala king, who had been ruling a tiny southern portion of the island around the Rohana district, sought to extend his power and expel the Chola occupier. Mahavamsa records that Virarajendra sent the Chola army stationed in the island to attack the Rohana district. Vijayabahu then sent for help from the king of Burma who sent ships and soldiers to assist Vijayabahu. With this help Vijayabahu succeeded in creating revolt in the northern provinces of Lanka. Although the Chola forces in the island and reinforcements sent from the mainland could control these revolts, Vijayabahu continued to create revolts and disturbances within the Chola occupied areas of the island for the next few years. Kadaram Campaign Virarajendra's records from his seventh year mention that he conquered Kadaram on behalf of a king who had come to ask for help and protection and handed it over to him. The possible date for this occurrence is 1068 C.E. There is not any more information to be gleaned from this inscription. In 1045 Airlangga, who ruled Srivijaya, divided the Kahuripan kingdom into two, Janggala (Malang) and Kediri and abdicated in favour of his two sons to live the life of an ascetic. During Virajrajendra's invasion in 1068, one of these sons might have ruled in Kedah. As yet we have no knowledge of the Srivijaya king who asked for help and the details of this naval campaign. The Cholas continued a series of raids and conquests throughout what is now Indonesia and Malaysia for the next 20 years. This first re-affirmed the hold of the Chola kingdom on the far east, it also enabled freeing of any barriers put by some kingdoms in the Java- Malaya peninsula on traders from Chola territories including from their subordinate divisions in Sri Lanka. While Srivijaya, Kediri, Champa etc. became independent later on, both during the time of Virarajendra till almost the last days of the Chola kingdom, at least till 1215 CE, trade relations between Tamizhagam and the Far East continued unhindered. Alliance with Chalukya Vikramaditya At the death of Someshvara I, his son Someshvara II came to the Chalukyan throne in April 1068 CE. Soon after a dispute broke out between him and his younger brother Vikramaditya and a civil war ensued in the Western Chalukya country. Vikramaditya VI fled to the Chola court of Virarajendra Chola , where he was well received by the king and the king Virarajendra himself records that he recognised Vikramaditya VI as the king of Western Chalukya. Virarajendra married his daughter to Vikramaditya VI and forged an alliance with him, halting the long feud between the two empires. Personal life He was a younger brother of Rajadhiraja Chola and Rajendra Chola II and regularly figures in many of their inscriptions.South Indian Inscriptions: Miscellaneous inscriptions in Tamil (4 pts. in 2), page 62 From the inscription of one of his successors viz., Kulothunga Chola I, in the Brihadeeswarar temple in Thanjavur dated in the 15th year of his reign, we know that the name of Virarajendra's queen was Arumolinangai.South Indian inscriptions, Volume 2, Parts 1-2 Virarajendra Chola's daughter Rajasundari married an Eastern Ganga Dynasty prince, and her son Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva became the progenitor of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Officials Isvaran singamani alias Tondaiman Solapperiyaraiyan was an officer of the king. He figures as early as the sixth year of the king's reign in an inscription at Tindivanam. He made a donation of twelve cows to the temple of Tiruttondisvara. Death and succession From an inscription of his from Tirunamanallur dated in the fourth year of his reign, we understand that Virarajendra Chola held the titles Sakalabhuvanasraya, Srimedinivallabha, Maharajadhiraja Cholakula-Sundara, Pandyakulantaka, Ahavamallakula-Kala, Ahavamallanai-mummadi-ven-kanda Rajasraya, Vira-Chola, Karikala Chola, The Glory of the Solar race, Sri-Virarajendradeva, Rajakesarivarma Perumanadigal (similar to the Nolamba Pallava titles of Permanadi from Kannada country) and Konerinmaikondan. Tirunamanallur was also called as Tirunavlur or Rajadittapuram, named after his great predecessor Rajaditya Chola. The very indication of Virarajendra mobilizing his armies for war made his adversaries especially the Salukkis, tremble with fear and every time they tried to confront him, be the Salukkis, Pandiyas or other adversaries of the Vengi territories, they met with nothing but defeat when they marched against him. Virarajendra Chola died in early 1070 CE after a short but extremely victorious rule. He probably was not very younger to his elder brother Rajendra II or Rajadhiraja Chola and was probably into his middle years when he ascended the throne. In fact, his can be termed (like that of Rajendra-I) as a completely victorious life in that he initially helped his father Rajendra Chola-I, then brothers Rajadhiraja-I and Rajendra-II in both administration and war. Later, upon taking over as King, he himself had a highly successful reign in terms of both internal administration and military conquests. In a way his achievements are comparable to those of Rajendra Chola-I, who expanded his empire inherited from the great Raja Raja Chola-I. Virarajendra was succeeded by his son and heir apparent Athirajendra Chola. The Thanjavur inscription of his successor Kulottunga I gives the name of Virarajendra's queen as Arumoli Nangai. He also had an elder brother called Alavandan on whom he conferred the title 'Rajaraja' or Rajadhiraja.Early in his reign Virarajendra appointed his son Madurantaka as viceroy of Tondaimandalam with the title of Cholendra. According to historian Sethuraman, this Madurantakan was the son of Rajadhiraja Chola I Another son Gangaikondachola was made viceroy of the Pandya territories. We have no clear information as to which of these two sons was Athirajendra. Like his elder brother Rajadhiraja, Virarajendra also referred to his father as the one who took Purvadesam, Gangai and Kadaram. The most stand out aspect of his rule is the fact that he is known to be the one who issued an excessively large number of grants and edicts . The king was a devotee at the feet of lord at Thillai(Sivan) at Chidambaram, to whom he presented a necklace consisting of rubies of high quality. However, like all his predecessors, he also patronized and cared for temples of all faiths including those of Lord Vishnu.Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), A History of South India - From Prehistoric Times to the Fall of Vijayanagar (Reprinted 2003).  Inscriptions  The inscriptions of Virarajendra begin with the introduction, Viramey-tunaiyagavum and he bore the title Rajakesari. An inscription of the king from a temple in Chingleput district gives his natal star as Aslesha. Another inscription from the Tiruttaleesvara temple in Tirupattur, Ramnad district mentions the king's father, as the conqueror of Purvadesam, Ganges and Kidaram.

His reign was marked by civil unrest, possibly religious in nature. Athirajendra Chola was last clan of Tamil Chola Dynasty. Chola and Eastern Chalukya Unity As a result of several intermarriages over a period of time when Rajaraja Chola gave his daughter Kundavai in marriage to Eastern Chalukya Vimaladitya, The Chola clan and the Vengi branch of the Chalukyan dynasty had become very close and the Vengi kings had become plainly Cholas at heart. Vengi Dynastic Struggles Cholas were also involved in the dynastic struggles of the Vengi throne, intermittently fighting on the sides of their favourite prince against a rival. These rivals were more often than not supported by the Western Chalukyas. Therefore, the Eastern Chalukyan kingdom had been a venue for a proxy war between the Cholas and the Western Chalukyas for generations. Virarajendra Chola interfered in the Vengi succession disputes after the Vengi king Rajaraja Narendra, who was closely related to the Chola clan through his mother Kundavai, a daughter of Rajaraja Chola, died in 1061 CE. The Vengi throne went to Saktivarman II in a palace coup. The Cholas wanted the Chola influence re-established in Vengi. Saktivarman II was killed, but Vijayaditya, Saktivarman‚Äôs father assumed the throne and repulsed the Chola attempts at unseating him. Vijayaditya however accepted to serving as a Chola vassal. Although this attempt at gaining total control over Vengi was unsuccessful, Virarajendra found another Chalukya ally in Vikramaditya by marrying his daughter to him. While these intrigues were going on, the son of Rajaraja Narendra, prince Rajendra Chalukya (the future Kulothunga Chola I) sought to become the Vengi king and felt Vijayaditya had usurped the throne that was rightfully his. The Cholas probably helped him in his efforts. Thwarted in his attempts by his uncle Vijayaditya, Rajendra Chalukya carved himself a small dominion near Baster District in Chhattisgarh state and bided his time. An opportunity arose with the demise of Virarajendra and Rajendra Chalukya acted swiftly to capture the Chola throne. Athirajendra‚Äôs Death The Chalukya author Bilhana gives a version of the background to Athirajendra‚Äôs troubles in his Vikramankadeva Charita. Soon after marrying his daughter to Chalukya Vikramaditya VI, Virarajendra Chola died. On hearing news of trouble and revolt in the Chola country following the emperor‚Äôs death, Vikramaditya, immediately marched to Kanchipuram to quell troubles there. Then he went to Gangaikonda Cholapuram, ‚Äòdestroyed the forces of the enemy and installed the prince (Athirajendra) on the throne‚Äô. After spending a month in the Chola capital, Vikramaditya VI apparently satisfied that peace was restored, returned to his country. Within a few days of his return, news about the death of Athirajendra in a fresh outbreak of rebellion reached him. The news also told him that Rajendra, son of Narendra and grandson of Rajendra Chola, had captured the Chola throne and assumed the title of Kulothunga Chola I. Vikramaditya immediately marched against Kulothunga. Someshvara II, the Western Chalukya king also joined him. The ascension of Kulothunga Chola marks the first time after Vijayalaya Chola that a person from the dynasty‚Äôs maternal lineage ascended the Chola throne. Other descendants of Cholas survived (through two different branches stemming from the many sons of Rajadhiraja Chola I and the six sons of Rajendra Chola II) for many more centuries to come. Religious troubles  Attempts have also been made to connect these internal disturbances in the Chola kingdom with the story of the persecution suffered by Ramanuja in the hands of the Cholas. It is possible to come to an assumption, based on early biographical works on Ramanuja, that the Chola monarch who subjected Ramanuja and his followers to persecution was Athirajendra or his father Virarajendra. According to Nilakanta Sastri, Krimikanta Chola, the persecutor of Ramanuja was Adhirajendra and he died in a local uprising of the Vaishnavas. This identification lends credence to the content of Divyasuricharitam, according to which the Chola family or line ended as the king was cursed for being intolerant.

A Tribsa involved a Triumph parallel twin engine installed in BSA motorcycle frame.

A batch of nine TriBSAs were planned by the factory (which factory?) for the 1966 ISDT using 348 cc, 490 cc and 'special capacity' 504 cc 'short' Triumph twin engines in a frame using geometry from the BSA Victor scrambler, Victor front forks and wheel together with a Triumph QD rear wheel in a Triumph swinging arm (swingarm in American English).

Hayles competed in the team pursuit and madison events, until his retirement in 2011. He now occasionally provides studio-based analysis of cycle races for British Eurosport. Career He first represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, where he rode the team pursuit. Hayles represented England in the points race and team pursuit at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, he won silver in the pursuit. He was in pursuit team that came third and rode the madison with Bradley Wiggins, finishing fourth. From 2001 to 2003 Hayles rode for the team in France. During this time Hayles rode the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix classic, one of cycling's five 'monuments', three times but was unable to finish the race on any occasion. Hayles still reports to love the paved classic despite his own poor fortune. In March 2008 he was withdrawn from the Great Britain team at the world track championships in Manchester, and was suspended for 14 days after a blood test showed a haematocrit 0.3% above the limit. His licence was restored after two weeks. The rules regarding haematocrit testing for track cycling were subsequently changed as the resting period before an event can cause the red cell volume to exceed 50%, with subsequent blood tests often proving the riders to be clean. He won the 2008 national road championships but was not selected to represent Great Britain in the Beijing Olympics. On 1 November 2008 he returned to the team pursuit for the Manchester round of the World Cup series.

In the Ramayana, she lived with her husband in a small hermitage on the southern border of the Chitrakuta forest. A pious woman who always practiced austerity and devotion, she is described as having miraculous powers. Her mother was Devahuti and her father was sage Kardama, Sage Kapila was her brother and teacher. She is extolled as Sati Anusuya ‚Äì Anusuya, the chaste wife of sage Atri. She later became the mother of Dattatreya, the sage-avatar of Vishnu and Durvasa, the irascible sage. When Sita and Rama visited her during their exile, Anusuya was very attentive to them, giving Sita an ointment which could maintain her beauty forever. Etymology Anasuya is composed of two Sanskrit words: Nah and Asuya. Nah' is a negative prefix which means absence, while Asuya means jealousy. Anasuya could be translated into English as the one who is free from jealousy or envy. Stories of Anasuya and Atri The story of Anasuya's family is mentioned in Bhagavata Purana Skanda III. Sage Kardama married Devahuti, daughter of Swayambhu Manu. They had ten children, a son named Kapila Maharshi (Lord Vishnu's avatar) and nine daughters including Anasuya. As each daughter was married to a rishi, Anasuya was married to Athri Maharshi. The Divine Trinity tests Anasuya Anasuya feeding the Hindu Trinity Sage Narada praised Anasuya in his hymns and verses, by which Laxmi, Parvati and Saraswati wanted to learn pativratya from Anasuya. They requested their husbands go ask her permission so that they could visit her in human form. The Divine Trinity went to Anasuya disguised as sages and asked permission for their wives in the form of bhiksha, on the condition that she would be naked while serving them. At first she was perplexed, but ultimately she understood who they were thanks to her yogic powers. She turned them into 6-month-old babies and removed her clothes to feed them with motherly affection. Many days passed as the three goddesses waited for their husbands to return. When the husbands did not return, they traveled to Anasuya's cottage and found them transformed into children. The Goddesses requested Anasuya to bring them back to normal. According to a popular version, the Holy Trinity was pleased with her chastity and devotion towards her husband, who then granted her a boon. She asked the Holy Trinity to be incarnated as her children, three sons and a daughter named Shubhatreyi. Another version relays a different result in which the gods merged and turned into Anasuya's three-headed son. A Bhagavata Purana manuscript page depicting the story of Atri and Anasuya meeting the Trimurti (PhP 4.1.21‚Äì25) (paper, late 18th century, Jaipur) A Brahmin named Kaushik from Pratishthan used to visit a prostitute, despite being a Brahmin and having a devoted wife. When he later became infected with leprosy, the prostitute stopped seeing him, forcing him to return to his wife who still cared for him. He still longed for the affection of the prostitute, so one day, he asked his wife to take him to her. In that town, sage Mandavya had been impaled in lieu of a crime and was lying on a spike in the forest. While being led by his wife through the deep forest at night, Kaushik happened to trip on the sage, who cursed him to death before the next sunrise. To stop the curse, Kaushik's wife stopped the sunrise with the power of her love, creating havoc in the heavens. The gods went to Brahma for help, who in turn went to Anasuya, asking her to convince Kaushik's wife to allow the sunrise. Anasuya not only convinced Kaushik's wife to allow the sun to rise but also brought Kaushik back to life after the curse had run its course. Brahma was very happy with Anusuya and was then born to her as Chandraatri. Sometime later, Rahu masked the sun, cloaking the whole world in darkness. With powers granted by many years of austerity, Atri wrested the sun out of Rahu's hands, restoring light to the world and pleasing the gods. Sati Anusuya Ashrama View of Anusuya Temple, Uttarakhand Anusuya Devi Temple is in Uttarakhand, located further upstream on the Amrit Ganga- a tributary of Alakananda/Ganga. View of Mandakini River at Anusuya Ashrama Sati Anusuya Ashram is in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, located further upstream on the Mandakini River. It is 16 km away from the town, and set amidst thick forests where the melody of birdsong plays all day. It was where sage Atri, his wife Anusuya, and their three sons (who were three incarnations of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva), lived and are said to have meditated. Valmiki describes in the Ramayana that there once was no rain in Chitrakuta for ten years. There was a severe famine and nothing was left for animals and birds to eat or drink. Sati Anusuya performed intensive austerities and got the river Mandakini down on earth. This led to the growth of greenery and forests, and eliminated the suffering of all sages and animals.Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda ‚Äì Sarga 117 shloka 9, 10. Sati Anasuya Ashrama, at present, is a very peaceful place where several streams from the hills converge and form the Mandakini River. It is said that Rama along with Sita had visited this place to meet Maharishi Atri and Sati Anasuya. It was here that Sati Anasuya explained to Sita the grandeur and importance of satitva. The dense forests of Dandaka start from this place. It was ruled by Ravana, who had appointed strong rakshasas such as Khara and Viradha as its rulers. The place was infected by the terror of rakshasas.Ramayana, Ayodhya Kanda ‚Äì Sarga 116 shloka 11, 12. Popular culture The story of Anasuya has been adapted for film in India. Two movies in the Telugu language, both entitled Sati Anasuya were released in 1957 and 1971. The 1957 film was directed by Kadaru NagabhushanamSati Ansuya (1957). IMDb and starred Anjali Devi and Gummadi Venkateswara Rao. The 1971 film was directed by B. A. Subba Rao.Sati Ansuya (1971). IMDb Jamuna Ramanarao played the role of Anasuya, Sharada played Sumati and Tadepalli Lakshmi Kanta Rao played Atri Maharshi. The musical score was provided by P. Adinarayana Rao. The adaptation was also made in the Kannada language in 1966 wherein Pandari Bai played Anasuya, K S Ashwath was Atri, and Dr Rajkumar played the role of Narada Muni. He would be instrumental in bringing down the false pride of the wives of Trimurti. To test Anasuya, the Trimurti approached her for food. They appeared as unclothed sages with a condition. Anasuya transforms the Trimurti into toddlers, puts them in cradles, and feeds them. All the while, she sings to them, 'Aaadi deva aadi moola aadi bramha jo jo.' Atri also joins her.

The train was renamed from the Texas Chief, which the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway had introduced in 1948. Amtrak discontinued the Lone Star in 1979.  History  The Dallas section in July 1977 The Santa Fe introduced the Texas Chief on April 3, 1948, between Chicago and Galveston, Texas via Kansas City, Wichita, Oklahoma City, Fort Worth, and Houston. It was truncated to Houston in early 1967. From 1955 until 1968, a section would cut off at Gainesville, Texas to serve Denton, Texas and Dallas. Sante Fe conveyed the Texas Chief to Amtrak at the latter's inception in 1971. Amtrak changed the train's name from Texas Chief to Lone Star on May 19, 1974, after the Santa Fe determined that Amtrak's trains no longer met its service standards and demanded that Amtrak stop using the \\"Chief\\" name. The train was popular with students of the many colleges and universities along its route, such as the University of Kansas, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Wichita State University and the University of Oklahoma. It provided economical transportation to and from school. Amtrak considered, but rejected, a Dallas through routing because of concerns over the Dallas station, choosing to instead add a Fort Worth‚ÄìDallas section on July 1, 1975. The Dallas through cars were temporarily discontinued between October 1976 and February 15, 1977, during which time the Lone Star was combined with the Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles Southwest Limited (itself the successor of another Santa Fe mainstay, the Super Chief) between Chicago and Kansas City. Due to cuts by Congress as part of the Amtrak Reorganization Act of 1979pressed by the US Department of Transportation under the Carter administrationthe Lone Star was discontinued on October 8, 1979, leaving Oklahoma without passenger train service until 1999. Chicago‚ÄìHouston service was retained by adding a Houston section to the Chicago‚ÄìLaredo Inter-American, which split at Temple. At the time of its discontinuance, the Lone Star was Amtrak's seventh most popular long-distance train. The Houston section remained until 1981, when the Inter-American itself was cut back to San Antonio and renamed the Eagle. Guthrie station in February 2017  Current service along former route  Of the original Texas Chief/Lone Star route, only the Newton, Kansas‚ÄìWichita-Oklahoma City and Temple‚ÄìHouston-Galveston segments remain without passenger train service. Chicago‚ÄìNewton is served by Amtrak's Southwest Chief (itself the successor of another Santa Fe mainstay, the Super Chief), while Oklahoma City‚ÄìFort Worth is served by Amtrak's Heartland Flyer. While the Newton‚ÄìWichita‚ÄìOklahoma City portion does not have passenger train service, it has been served by Amtrak Thruway since April 2016. Chicago‚ÄìDallas service is provided by Amtrak's Texas Eagle via a different route than the Lone Star.  Equipment  During 1976‚Äì1977 when the Lone Star combined with the Southwest Chief between Chicago and Kansas City, the Lone Star consisted of two baggage cars, two Hi-Level coaches, a dormitory bar-lounge, an ex-Santa Fe dining car, two 10-roomette/6-bedroom Pine-series sleeping cars, and a 48-seat single-level coach.

Banque du Liban (BDL, , ) is the central bank of Lebanon. It was established on August 1, 1963 and became fully operational on April 1, 1964. It is currently headed by Riad Salameh. One of the main responsibilities of the bank is issuing Lebanon's currency, the Lebanese Pound. Other responsibilities include maintaining monetary stability, regulation of money transfers, and maintaining the soundness of the banking sector. Banking is a very important part of Lebanon's economy with over 100 different banks, which makes the role of Banque du Liban particularly important. It currently owns 99.37% of the shares of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines. Besides the main branch in Beirut, it has branches in Aley, Baalbeck, Bikfaya, Jounieh, Nabatiye, Sidon, Tripoli, Tyre, and Zahl√©.  History  Ottoman domination of Lebanon, which lasted for more than four centuries, was brought to an end on October 6, 1918, with the entry of the Levant Marine Division into Beirut. The paper money issued by the Turkish Treasury, with a forced exchange rate, suffered the same fate. In order to normalize economic life in the occupied territories and cover the expenses of the allied forces, English authorities imposed the banknote of the National Bank of Egypt, the Egyptian currency having been, since October 30, 1916, closely linked to the sterling and entirely covered by securities issued in sterling. In accordance with the convention signed between the French and the British governments on September 15, 1919, a new occupying authority started to rule Lebanon. French troops replaced the British, under the command of General Gouraud, who was appointed on October 12, 1919 as \\"High-Commissioner of the French Republic in Syria and Cilicia, and Commander-in-Chief of the Levant Army\\". Consequently, the use of the Egyptian currency, suitable for the British Treasury, became inappropriate. To obtain Egyptian pounds, France, being the sole occupying power, had to offer increasing amounts of francs. During World War I, the French franc had maintained its status thanks to advances from the British and American treasuries. However, in 1919, the French franc registered a drop because of the British government's decision to stop these advances, thus breaking the alliance between the franc, the sterling and the dollar, and also because of the United States Government's decision to suspend its regulating role of the associated change rates. In order to replace the Egyptian pound, the French government decided, by Decree N¬∞ 129 issued by the High Commissioner on March 13, 1920, to endow Syria with a national currency. On September 1, 1920, the representative of France proclaimed Great Lebanon. In 1920, the Bank of Syria was granted the concession of issuing the Syrian currency, which became legal tender on May 1, 1920. Banknotes issued by this bank were reimbursable to the bearer or at sight by checks drawn on Paris, at the rate of FF 20 for one Syrian pound. As a consequence, an independent, currency-issuing department was established at the Bank of Syria. It was responsible for putting in circulation and withdrawing banknotes. Issuances were made either on behalf of the Treasury in Paris or on behalf of the Bank itself. Concerning commercial operations, the Issuing Department was to provide the Bank of Syria with banknotes only in exchange of foreign currencies or foreign securities, which constituted, together with the credits granted by the Treasury in Paris, the coverage of the currency in circulation.  Role and function  The Banque du Liban was established by the Code of Money and Credit promulgated on 1 August 1963, by decree no. 13513. It started to operate effectively on 1 April 1964. BDL is a legal public entity enjoying financial and administrative autonomy. It is not subject to the administrative and management rules and controls applicable to the public sector. Its capital is totally appropriated by the State. The BDL is endowed by law, with the prerogatives to fulfill its mission. It can use all measures it deems appropriate to ensure exchange rate stability, specifically the intervention in the foreign exchange market by buying and selling foreign currencies. The BDL controls bank liquidity by adjusting discount rates, by intervening in the open market, as well as by determining credit facilities to banks and financial institutions. It regulates banks' credit in terms of volume and types of credit, by imposing credit ceiling, by directing credits towards specific purposes or sectors and setting the terms and regulations governing credits in general. The BDL imposes on banks reserve requirements on assets and loans as determined by BDL, as well as penalties should shortfalls occur. Investment in TBs may be considered by the BDL as part of the reserve requirements. The BDL grants licenses for the establishment of banks, financial institutions, brokerage firms, money dealers, foreign banks, leasing companies and mutual funds in Lebanon. The Banking Control Commission controls and supervises these institutions. Conferring with the Association of Banks, the BDL issues circulars and resolutions governing the relations of banks with their customers. There is regular coordination between the BDL and the government in order to ensure consistency between BDL's objectives and those of the government. Cooperation with the government implies coordinating fiscal and monetary policy measures. It informs the government on economic matters that might negatively affect the national economy and currency and suggests measures that might benefit the balance of payments, the price level, public finance and offers advice on how to promote economic growth. It also ensures the relations between the government and international financial institutions.  Monetary policy  A favorable environment has characterized the Lebanese economy in 2003. Lebanon is maintaining its commitment to exchange rate stability and to the soundness of its banking sector, in addition to implementing an ambitious fiscal adjustment program. Confidence was boosted by the successful outcome of Paris-II conference, held in November 2002 with the participation of a number of countries and international organizations. An aggregate amount of US$4.3 billion was pledged in 15-year loans at reduced rates to support the government's economic reform plan for lowering the servicing cost of public debt, which accumulated over the years due to costly reconstruction efforts. These developments led to a significant drop in TBs' interest rates, followed by a cut in commercial banks' average deposit and lending rates in Lebanese pound (LBP) and in foreign currencies. In parallel, USD holdings were being converted on a wide scale into LBP holdings. Moreover, the BOP performance, which started to improve in May 2002, remained on the same trend, with cumulative surpluses exceeding $2 billion at end-April 2003, while BDL assets in foreign currencies stood at more than $10 billion, excluding gold. In the last few months, a strong demand emerged on Lebanese government paper in local and foreign currencies, due to increased confidence, reinforced in April by the Government's ability to pay from the Treasury a maturing $500 million Eurobond issue, without resorting to rollover as in the past. This was accompanied by a positive assessment by the IMF and major international rating agencies, which considered that Lebanon is on the right track in trying to end its economic and financial difficulties, and that its performance in coping with the aftermath of the war in Iraq is the best in the region. In the banking sector, equity capital continued to increase, reaching $3.5 billion at end-April, and pushing the average capital adequacy ratio to 18%. Despite their modest growth, private sector loans attained 100% of GDP, a unique performance in itself. Deposits grew at an annual 11% rate, reaching $47 billion at end-April - more than double the GDP - with a dollarization rate dropping to 68%, from a 74% peak in May 2002. This excellent performance was buttressed by the BDL's efforts to strengthen prudential supervision, paving the way for compliance with Basle-II requirements by a sound banking sector, ready to better manage operational risks, and to improve transparency and good governance. The government's commitment to decelerate the growth of public debt and to reduce its servicing cost was reflected in the conservative budgets of 2002 and 2003. Coupled with measures to achieve the highest possible proceeds from privatization and securitization, this strategy will be pursued over the medium term, expectedly leading to a public finance recovery. The government has recently launched an ambitious 5-year economic reform program in hopes to cut the country's debt. The outcome of the reform program will largely be dependent on Banque du Liban.  Governing body  The Banque du Liban is managed by the Governor who is assisted by four vice-governors, as well as by the Central Council.

They facilitate the transport of sugars from a sugar source, mainly mature leaves, to a sugar sink, often developing leaves or fruits. They are found in nectaries of flowers and some carnivorous plants. Transfer cells are specially found in plants in the region of absorption or secretion of nutrients.Stern's Introductory Plant Biology, 13th Ed.
