As of the 2010 census, the city population was 759. History The Texas Townsite Company bought the land in 1889. When the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway was built through the area in 1890, Lott was founded; it was named in honor of Uriah Lott, president of the railroad. A post office was established at the settlement in 1890, with S. J. Crump as postmaster. When the community was incorporated by unanimous vote later that year, its population was estimated at more than 200. By 1892 Lott had Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, two cotton gins and gristmills, a weekly newspaper, and 350 residents. Its population estimates were as high as 1,200 by the end of the 1890s. Lott continued to prosper throughout the first part of the 20th century when the town developed into a well-known speed trap, securing the town's primary revenue source to the present day. The First National Bank of Lott was established in 1903, and the Lott State Bank was chartered in 1909. Local businesses did well, and residents were optimistic about the community's future growth. Lott's economy received an additional boost in the 1920s when State Highway 44 (later U.S. 77) built through the community. The Great Depression, however, brought significant changes. In 1933, the First National Bank of Lott went into receivership and did not reopen. During the mid-1930s, many local families had to accept government relief to make ends meet, although the Public Works Administration and the Works Progress provided some residents with jobs on street and water works. Cotton and corn were for many years the staple crops of area farmers, but government subsidies encouraged diversification into stock raising and truck farming. The population of the community was reported as 921 in the 1930s; it rose to 1,021 in the 1940s, but fell to 956 by the early 1950s. Lott lost its rail service in 1967, when the Southern Pacific abandoned the section of track between Waco and Rosebud. Population estimates for Lott fluctuated between 750 and 950 residents from the 1960s through the 1980s, and the number of businesses fell steadily, from 45 in the 1940s to 12 in the 1980s. Thirteen businesses and 828 residents were reported in Lott at the end of the 1980s. In 1990, its population was estimated at 775. In June 2015, a TV station reported that the cities of Calvert, Franklin, Hearne, and Lott in a \\"Texas Triangle\\" were using their police departments to issue numerous speeding tickets to turn their municipal court into a \\"cash cow\\".Judge says he quit over speeding ticket quota; WFAA 8 TV; June 3, 2015. Geography Lott is located southwest of the center of Falls County at (31.2070, -97.0329), on high ground between the north-flowing Little Deer Creek and the south-flowing Cottonwood Creek, both tributaries of the Brazos River. U.S. Route 77 passes through the city, leading north to Waco and south to Cameron. Texas State Highway 320 crosses US 77 at the west edge of downtown; it leads northeast to Marlin and southwest to Zabcikville. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Lott has a total area of , of which , or 1.40%, is water.

The population was 6,628 at the 2000 census but decreased by 10% to 5,967 in 2010. Since 1851, it has been the county seat of Falls County. Marlin has been given the nickname \\"the Hot Mineral Water City of Texas\\". Mineral waters were found there in 1892. History=Establishment and Antebellum Era (1851-1861) The city of Marlin is located east of the Brazos River, which runs through the center of the county. The low falls on the river southwest of present-day Marlin was the site of Sarahville de Viesca, established in 1834 by Sterling C. Robertson. The act of the state legislature creating Falls County that passed on January 28, 1850 established Viesca (renamed Fort Milam) as the county seat. Citizens petitioned to choose their own location and a vote was held on January 21, 1851 that established the county seat at Adams, near the home of Dr. Allensworth Adams. On March 22, 1851, the Falls County commissioners court voted to rename Adams the \\"Town of Marlin\\" to honor former Robertson County alcalde John Marlin. The new town of Marlin was laid out around a courthouse square and a log courthouse was constructed which also served as a school and church. In 1854 a new courthouse was constructed for $5,000, painted white with dark green shutters and a chrome yellow door. In 1859, the population of Marlin was 2,875 whites; 1,225 slaves; 9 free blacks.  Early Schools  The first schools in Falls County were private schools established at Marlin. A tuition school, Marlin Male and Female Academy, was located on Ward Street in 1871, north of the courthouse square. The school was renamed and relocated before finally being sold in 1886, only to be destroyed by fire in 1900. A new public brick school was constructed in 1903 and a high school was completed in 1917. The Marlin Independent School District was established in 1923. Nearly half a century before in 1875, two other schools for African Americans were organized. The two black schools were dependent on state funds, and met in the African and Baptist churches. In 1916, the city council voted to build a school for blacks; later, the Booker T. Washington High School was constructed in 1951 on Commerce Street and designed by the architectural firm of Thomas, Jameson and Merrill. This school remains standing but is vacant. The two school districts merged in 1968 into the Marlin Independent School District. In 1900, the town's Jewish residents organized a Sunday school.\\"Marlin, Texas\\" , found in the Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities,  Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)  The town of Marlin was formally incorporated by the state legislature on January 12, 1867. Two former slaves served as elected or appointed officials in Marlin: Nelson Denson and Lige Moore. The Houston & Texas Central Railway reached Marlin on 1871 as a stop on the \\"Waco Tap\\" line that extended northwest from Bremond (Robertson County) to Waco. The location of the depot on the eastern side of the town led to the development of a commercial district eastward from the courthouse square along Live Oak Street. In 1875, the 1854 courthouse burned and a new brick courthouse was constructed. The courthouse was badly damaged in a storm in 1886 and replaced with a new structure designed by architect Eugene T. Heiner.  The Mineral Water Era (1890s-1960s)  In 1891, the City of Marlin issued bonds worth $25,000 to drill an artesian well. Hot mineral water was accidentally discovered and later found to have medicinal properties. To harness the potential benefit of these \\"healing waters,\\" the first bath house was constructed in 1895 with several others to follow. A least two of those early houses had large swimming pools with ornate covered buildings. Other bath houses were subsequently constructed that included individual bathing areas with marble tubs, and cooling rooms with available massages for a full spa treatment. Thousands were soon attracted to Marlin to \\"take the cure.\\" While Marlin had a number of small hotels in the 19th century, the construction of the three-story Arlington Hotel in 1895 demonstrated the economic impact and potential of the mineral water industry. The hotel and adjacent bathhouse burned in January 1899 but were both replaced with more elaborate structures that opened in 1901. The new Arlington Hotel hosted notable community events, and statewide conventions. Other than the Hilton and the numerous boarding houses (such as Captain Bourrupt's and the Harris Houses) there were several other hotels, among them the Fannin, the Majestic and the Imperial, all on Coleman Street and within a few blocks of the public hot water fountain and the mineral water wells - on a sort of bath house row. In 1929, Conrad Hilton began construction of a Hilton Hotel that was opened on May 27, 1930 at a cost of $375,000 and to which Marlin citizens and businesses contributed $50,000. The nine-floor, 110-room hotel remains the tallest building in Marlin and was built on Coleman Street across from the Marlin Sanitarium Bathhouse which burned in the early 1990s. The hotel was connected to the bathhouse by a tunnel that has NOT been filled in but is inaccessible. Mr. Hilton's first venture into the hotel business that featured several hotels in Cisco, Mineral Wells, El Paso, and Marlin were not successful and Mr. Hilton sold those hotels in the 1930s. The Marlin Hilton was bought and later known as the Falls Hotel. It has been closed since the early 1960s as a hotel but parts of the first floor have held small businesses-beauty shops, an optometrist's office, an insurance agency, and restaurants. One such restaurant, the Cactus, occupied its space for about ten years until about 2016. For many years the first floor ballroom also featured class reunions and school dances as well as public outside auction house usages. None of those businesses occupy the hotel at present. The hotel structure still stands but is unoccupied. In recent years sporadic renovations have occurred. Along with the decline of the hot mineral water industry after World War II and the advent of penicillin, many of the bathhouse-related businesses closed and those older structures were gradually demolished or reconfigured. Most of the remnants of the bath house businesses had closed by the late 1960s. In the early 1980s a short-lived revival with some new bathing structures not did succeed nor did one other attempt at that industry's revitalization in that 1990s. Only the Buie-Allen Hospital (c. 1915) and a very few former boarding houses remain as apartments, as well as some of the intact late-19th century commercial district and numerous early 20th century residences constructed by doctors and many others who served the bath house clientele. Hot mineral water can still sometimes be obtained from a fountain outside the Marlin Chamber of Commerce in the 1929 pavilion when the city bothers to maintain that access. The former location of the one of the several bath houses, the Sanitarium Bath House (burned down by accidental arson), is now a small city park featuring a gazebo that is adjacent to the old Houston & Texas Central railroad tracks and is currently owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The waters remain and there are at least three wells still active but are not accessible. The local three story Falls Community Hospital, as of the 1980s, has heated its structure via the mineral water. There is a very active Falls County Historical Commission with an extensive museum and a lively theater group, The Palace Theatre, that features plays and dinner-house productions as well as occasional outside professional entertainment.  Marlin as a Baseball Spring Training Site (1904-1918)  Marlin's mild climate, hot mineral water baths and proximity by train to Dallas, Houston and San Antonio made it an appealing spring training location for Major League Baseball teams. Four different teams trained in Marlin from 1904 to 1918: the Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants. Players stayed at the Arlington Hotel, which is no longer standing. = Chicago White Sox (1904) = The Chicago White Sox baseball team visited \\"Marlin Springs\\" from March 7 to March 17, 1904 as part of their spring training tour of the South. The team's selection of Marlin can be credited to Ted Sullivan. The Chicago Tribune quoted Sullivan in an article published on February 7, 1904: \\"If I had looked the United States over for a spring training ground for a ball club, I do not believe I could have found a spot I would pick ahead of Marlin Springs ... [Charles] Comiskey asked me last December when I was coming to Texas to pick him out a place to train. I met a man in Dallas, who told me he left his crutches at Marlin; that he went there suffering with rheumatism. I took a run down to Marlin ... and I found the ideal spot for training grounds. The place has a magnificent hotel. Adjoining this place is a beautiful natatorium equipped with hot sulphur and all kinds of baths... The ball grounds here are on even surface and are only four blocks from the hotel. This is the spot I selected for the Chicago American league club...\\" The White Sox left Marlin on March 17 \\"with expressions of regret and of hope that its individuals will be with the White Sox next spring when they return here for a similar stay.\\" Among those on the White Sox who trained in Marlin was George Davis. On the last full day (March 16), Manager Nixey Callahan had the team make a ten-mile round trip walk to the Brazos River after dinner. = St. Louis Cardinals (1905) = The St. Louis Cardinals chose \\"Marlin Springs\\" as their 1905 spring training site after delays in preparations of a site in Houston. As a result, the Chicago White Sox chose to train in New Orleans. The Cardinals arrived in Marlin on March 6, 1905 and \\"a large gathering of local fans [were] on hand to welcome the big leaguers.\\" Visits to the hot mineral water baths were a part of the team's daily routine. A St. Louis newspaper reported that \\"[practice] ends at 4 o'clock and the players get to the bath about fifteen minutes later. The baths are hot, and it takes until 5 before the players are cooled off enough to go to the hotel, which is but a couple of steps distant. The baths not only put the players in first-class condition and remove any surplus weight, but they also tend to prevent soreness.\\" The Cardinals broke camp at Marlin on March 17, 1905. = Cincinnati Reds (1906-1907) = The Cincinnati Reds baseball team held spring training in Marlin in 1906 and 1907. = New York Giants (1908-1918) = The New York Giants baseball team (now the San Francisco Giants) held spring training in Marlin from 1908 to 1918. Modern utilities in Marlin Phones began appearing in households in Marlin in the year 1900. Automobiles, electricity, and Lone Star Gas followed shortly. By the mid-1900s, Marlin had a bottling company, stock pens, a brickyard, a turkey-processing plant (building can still be seen on Williams Street/South Business Highway 6), a saddlery, a water crystallization plant, and a pottery plant. The 2000s The loss of major employers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries resulted in a loss of population and a reduction in the city's tax base. While at the census in 2000 Marlin had a population of 6,628 (a modest increase of 242 people from 1990), by 2010 the population had declined to 5,967 residents. According to the US and Texas census Marlin's largest population peaked at two times in its history, 1950 and 1980, with 7009 being its highest. First to change hands or close was Swift turkey processing plant. Next was Marlin Mills, a carpet manufacturing company, closed during the 1980s economic decline. A styrofoam company, open in another building in Marlin's industrial park, caught fire and the remains were demolished. A dress manufacturing plant which catered to large businesses, such as the airline industry, closed. Wallace, a business form printing company employing hundreds, closed in the mid-2000s. When George W Bush came to office, he tapped Anthony Principi, who then closed about 1100 small to medium-sized VA hospitals all over the US; one of which was The Thomas T. Connally Veterans Affairs Hospital, a five-floor building located at the corner of Ward and Virginia streets. The hospital closed in 2005, resulting in the loss of more than a hundred jobs, as the economy in Marlin continued to wane. More recent investments include the construction of a three-floor, sixty-room Best Western Hotel on Highway 6, at Farm-to-Market Road 147. However, plans for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to open a medical facility for prisoners at the former Veterans' Affairs Hospital, expected to add an additional 100 to 150 jobs to the Marlin economy, did not materialize. Funds were reallocated to renovate the TDJC hospital in Galveston, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Rita. =2011= The Heart of Texas Council of Governments granted the city of Marlin $35,000 to remove fifteen dilapidated buildings and structures in the town, which included 300 tons of debris. Over of water lines were constructed on 20 streets in 2011. The city also started and completed a 500,000-gallon water tower project. In 2011, the city brought back its Annual Music and Blues Festival, and raised money to revamp the city baseball fields and revive the City Little League, which attracted 160 children that year. The city's crime rate decreased by 45 percent in 2011. =2015= On November 10, 2015, Marlin Chief of Police Darrell Allen died while in office. He had suffered a gunshot while at an off-duty security job in Temple on November 1. The suspect was placed into custody at the scene by other officers working security.\\"Slain Police Chief's Body Returned To Central Texas\\" (Archive). KWTX-TV. November 11, 2015. Retrieved on January 19, 2016. In December 2015 a protest occurred after the city water had been turned off for almost a week. It was determined that even after the city and the state had extensively renovated the water treatment system, the man who had worked for the city as the water systems manager instead of calling for repairs cut wires when alarms sounded instead of fixing the problem. The state found those dismantlings and disengaging of the systems when they removed panels to determine the problems. When the alarms sounded, that now former employee/manager just the cut wires so as not to have to listen to the alarms. This led to a city-wide water crisis that caused the water system to repair that extensive damage. =2019= On May 4, 2019, Marlin native Carolyn Lofton was elected as the first black woman to serve as mayor. She stated that she was motivated to run \\"on a desire to uplift and improve the community in which I live for all those who are currently here and those who seek to make a home here.\\" Geography Marlin is located in east-central Falls County at (31.307975, -96.892975).

History  David Crockett discovered the area of Honey Grove when he camped there on his way to join the Texas Army at San Antonio in 1836. Crockett sent many letters back to Tennessee, telling of an area with an abundance of honey- filled trees, hence the town's name. In 1837, Samuel Erwin became the first settler of the place. B. S. Walcott contributed much to the town's development, by planning the city's landscape and later on by selling building lots. In 1873, Honey Grove was officially established. Samuel Erwin and Davy Crockett, old friends from Kentucky, were instrumental in the founding of Honey Grove. Samuel Augustus Erwin has a large gravestone marker in Honey Grove, stating: \\"Virginia-born Samuel Erwin was married in 1819 in Tennessee to Sally Rodgers Crisp (1795‚Äì1860), in a ceremony performed by local magistrate David Crockett. First settler in the Honey Grove area, Erwin arrived here in 1837 and surveyed land grants for other pioneers. A surveyor by profession, he platted the town site for his friend B.S. Wolcott in 1848. He was the town's first postmaster and one of Fannin County's earliest Justices of the Peace.\\" The Crockett Park Monument, in the same area, indicates that Honey Grove was named by Crockett, but he died before it could become a town. It states that one of his old friends, Sam Erwin, became the founder of the settlement. The monument reads in part that Crockett traveled by riverboat, horseback, and on foot, entering Texas along the Red River, camping at a site half a mile northeast of today's park, where he found wild bees and honey in hollow trees, and called the campsite a \\"honey grove\\". He is said to have told friends he would settle here later, but he died a few weeks later in the cause of Texan liberty, at the Alamo. In 2007, Honey Grove was also a temporary filming location for an episode of One Tree Hill, in which the local high school won a contest the CW and Sunkist promoted. Fans submitted videos in hopes their town would be selected. Mark Schwahn, the creator of One Tree Hill, ultimately chose Honey Grove High School as the winner.

Jr. of Mannsville, Ok., died Fannin Co., Tx. 1914 The name \\"Trenton\\" was submitted to the postal authorities (after Trenton, New Jersey), and the post office opened under that name in 1881. The railroad drew people to Trenton from nearby communities, and a depot was built. The first population figures available show 200 people living there in the mid-1880s. Fifteen years later the population was 300 and the town had a school and all essential businesses, including a newspaper, a steam gristmill, a hotel, and a boardinghouse. At that time it became a major shipping origination point for cotton, corn, and oats produced by area farmers. A national bank was opened in Trenton in 1901 and by 1914 was capitalized at $40,000. By the mid-1920s the population had risen to just over 600 people, and the Trenton school system had 300 students enrolled. In the early 1930s farmers in the vicinity, influenced by the success of local farmer P. E. Brown, began large-scale commercial production of onions. This new crop grew rapidly in importance, and production reached a peak in 1933 when 158 rail carloads were shipped from Trenton. The effects of the Great Depression were devastating in the region, and by 1936 Trenton's population had declined to less than 500. During this time of economic hardship, the number of businesses serving the community dwindled to 28. With the recovery of the economy, the population also began to rise, with 634 reported in 1948 to an all-time high of 712 by 1967. In 1977 Trenton reported 615 residents and seventeen businesses. By the early 1980s the town had become the third-largest shipping point for onions in North Texas. It had an estimated 682 people and twenty businesses by 1988.

Features=Technical overview From a technical perspective, BETA provides several unique features. Classes and Procedures are unified to one concept, a Pattern. Also, classes are defined as properties/attributes of objects. This means that a class cannot be instantiated without an explicit object context. A consequence of this is that BETA supports nested classes. Classes can be virtually defined, much like virtual methods can be in most object-oriented programming languages. Virtual entities (such as methods and classes) are never overwritten; instead they are redefined or specialized. BETA supports the object-oriented perspective on programming and has comprehensive facilities for procedural and functional programming. It has powerful abstraction mechanisms to support identification of objects, classification and composition. BETA is a statically typed language like Simula, Eiffel and C++, with most type checking done at compile- time. BETA aims to achieve an optimal balance between compile-time type checking and run-time type checking. Patterns A major and peculiar feature of the language is the concept of patterns. In another programming language, such as C++, one would have several classes and procedures. BETA expresses both of these concepts using patterns. For example, a simple class in C++ would have the form class point { int x, y; }; In BETA, the same class could be represented by the pattern point: (# x, y: @integer #) That is, a class called point will have two fields, x and y, of type integer. The symbols (# and #) introduce patterns. The colon is used to declare patterns and variables. The @ sign before the integer type in the field definitions specifies that these are integer fields, and not, by contrast, references, arrays or other patterns. As another comparison, a procedure in C++ could have the form int max(int x, int y) { if(x >= y) { return x; } else { return y; } } In BETA, such a function could be written using a pattern max: (# x, y, z: @integer enter (x, y) do (if x >= y // True then x -> z else y -> z if) exit z #) The x, y and z are local variables. The enter keyword specifies the input parameters to the pattern, while the exit keyword specifies the result of the function. Between the two, the do keyword prefixes the sequence of operations to be made. The conditional block is delimited by (if and if), that is the if keyword becomes part of the opening and closing parenthesis. Truth is checked through // True within an if block. Finally, the assignment operator -> assigns the value on its left hand side to the variable on its right hand side. Hello world!

The settlement began at the location of a stagecoach stop on an old road between San Felipe and Bastrop. Even though Fayette County was named after General Lafayette, the Revolutionary War hero, the community was named in 1844 after Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a prominent citizen of the time, who had surveyed the community, named its streets, and donated lots for the Fayetteville Academy and the town's multidenominational Union Church.Handbook of Texas Fayetteville was incorporated in 1882. The town made national news during World War I. As reprinted by Stars and Stripes in its March 15, 1918 issue, the town's mayor, W. C. Langlotz, and ten of the town's citizens were charged with espionage. They were arrested following the display of the flag of the German Empire over the entryway of the Germania club in Fayetteville.

Located on Interstate 10 and the Union Pacific Railroad, west of Schulenburg, the population was 1,383 at the 2010 census. History Established on April 8, 1874 on land that the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway acquired from William Alexander Faries (the family name is also spelled \\"Ferris\\" and \\"Farris\\"), the community was named after F. W. Flato, a local merchant and one of the first settlers, of whom most were Anglo American. Residents placed their homes in the former Flatonia settlement, one mile southeast of the current Flatonia, and in the community of Oso, northeast, on wagons and moved to the new location. The post office, established in the former Flatonia in 1870, moved to the new Flatonia with the same name. Flatonia was incorporated on November 10, 1875, and held its first election on December 6 of that year. In 1878 the town had 800 residents and an economy dependent on cattle and cotton. The location of the railway and inexpensive real estate led to the arrival of Arab, Bohemian, German, Greek, and Italian immigrants in several waves. The north-south line of the Waco branch of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway opened in the mid-1880s, leading to new settlements of Muldoon and Moulton. Competition from the settlements, respectively north and south of Flatonia, and an agricultural depression damaged Flatonia's economy. By 1900 Flatonia had a significant population decrease. During the first half of the 20th century Flatonia's prospects increased and decreased according to the national economy and cattle and cotton markets. In 1950 Flatonia had 1,024 residents, 50 businesses, and a wide farm and ranch service area. In the 1960s cotton no longer was a substantial aspect of the area economy; therefore many area farms began to ranch cattle. During that time the population was between 1,000 and 1,500. Interstate 10 (I-10) opened in the 1970s, leading many tourist businesses to move from U.S. Highway 90 to I-10, one mile north of Highway 90. In 1985 Flatonia had six businesses.

The population was 643 at the 2010 census.  History  In 1885, shortly after Fisher County was organized, a dispute arose between business partners from Mississippi and a town called Fisher. Both wanted their land to host the courthouse. The partners were M.L. and D.C. Roby, and the town of Fisher is now called North Roby. In 1886, construction was begun on the new courthouse and a school and post office opened. The community had 13 houses by that summer. In 1890, the population was estimated to be 300 people and the town had a hotel, two general stores, Baptist and Methodist churches, a restaurant, and a weekly newspaper, the Fisher County Call. Roby had no jail until 1892, when one was constructed out of stone. A new jail was built in 1926 out of brick, and is still in use as of 2010. It has had three different courthouses during its existence, unlike many Texas county seats, which have preserved and restored original courthouses. The most recent courthouse was built in 1972, and is strikingly modern in comparison to those found in many Texas counties. In 1898, the first bank was chartered and the Roby school district was formed. The area covered by the school district grew slowly over the years as it absorbed rural schools in the vicinity. By 1900, the population had grown to 712 residents. By 1914, it had Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Nazarene churches. Telephone service was also established as of 1914. Roby received its first railroad in 1907 (The Texas Central) and in 1915 the Roby and Northern laid 4.4-miles of track to connect Roby proper with North Roby. In 1930 the population was 801. It actually increased during the Great Depression ‚Äì reaching 904 for the 1940 Census. The Roby and Northern line was scrapped during World War II and its rails went to the war effort. Roby incorporated in 1915, and its population grew to 801 in 1930 and 904 in 1940. The population peaked in 1950 with 1,040 people calling Roby and North Roby home, and 60 businesses.

Historic cooperative elevator in Crowell History Located between the Pease River to the north and the North Wichita River to the south, the area has long been home to a variety of hardy animal and plant species. Native grasses tend to be hardy and drought-tolerant. Tree varieties include bush juniper, mesquite, hackberry, mulberry, and pecan, in addition to several imports that thrive in the warm, semiarid conditions. Native animals species include coyotes, squirrels, badgers, raccoons, and the occasional fox. Deer have also become plentiful in recent decades, as have feral pigs. Bird species include quail, dove, and several types of migratory waterfowl. Crowell is on the migration path of the monarch butterfly. Crowell is only a few miles from the recapture location of Cynthia Ann Parker. Known locally as the Pease River battleground, Cynthia Ann, captured as a child by raiding Indians, was recaptured here as an adult by U.S. soldiers. Cynthia Ann was the mother of Quanah Parker, considered the last great chief of the Comanche. Though few notables and celebrities call Crowell home, some worth mentioning remain. Former football star Dick Todd set long-standing records as a running back for Texas A&M; University. He then went on to play for, and eventually coach, the Washington Redskins. Todd's son, Denny, died as a teenager from injuries sustained on the football field. His memory is honored each year with an award in his name. The award is presented to the football team member who shows the greatest personal contribution to the team, both on and off the field. The remote, rural location minimizes light pollution, making for an excellent view of the night sky. As a result, Crowell is home to Comanche Springs Astronomy Campus, a observatory built by the Three Rivers Foundation for the Arts & Sciences. The economy is almost solely agrarian. Beef cattle, wheat, and cotton are the primary sources of income and employment. Hunting leases are quickly becoming a notable contributor to the local economy. The single manufacturing industry is a cap factory. Formerly owned by the DeLong company, the factory is now owned by a group of local investors. Though a small, rural community, Crowell still has interests. In addition to the observatory, a museum was built by the Foard County Historical Society. Housed in the former firehouse, the museum boasts artifacts from the history of Crowell and environs. Most notable is the one-of-a-kind scale town. The diorama-style exhibits are designed to reflect the historically notable businesses in city history. Just across the street from the Firehall Museum is the Farm Implement Museum. In 2009, the Zion Lutheran Cemetery was named an historic Texas cemetery by the Texas Historical Commission. The cemetery is located just west of the Zion Lutheran Church near the intersection of Farm to Market Road 2073 and FM 2074 several miles off U.S. Highway 70 between Lockett and Crowell.Wichita Falls Times Record News, September 28, 2009 Education The city is served by the Crowell Independent School District and home to the Crowell High School Wildcats.

Eschbach explained that \\"as a large minority middle class started to emerge, Fort Bend was virgin territory that all groups could move to.\\" When explaining why many of the new residents were of minority groups rather than white Americans, Eschbach added, \\"Many minorities are looking for mixed communities, where whites might feel it's more optimal to live in a subdivision that's more homogeneous with their own group.\\" Kever said that in previous eras, \\"Four Corners has always been a multicultural mashup, its residents united by poverty and an appreciation for life in the slow lane.\\" By 2011 many newer residents were wealthier than the original residents. Government and infrastructure As of 2011 the original section of Four Corners is serviced by a water system of the Fort Bend Freshwater Supply District No. 2 and individual septic systems. Newer areas have municipal utility districts, which provide sewer and water services. Originally residents of the original section used individual water wells.

The population was 19,069 at the 2010 census, up from 6,603 at the 2000 census. Fresno is located in the extra- territorial jurisdiction (ETJ) of Houston, which is the fourth largest city in the nation in population. Fresno is bordered by Houston to the north, the suburban Fort Bend County cities of Missouri City to the west and northwest, Arcola to the south and southwest, and the Brazoria County city of Pearland to the east. Geography Map of Fresno CDP Fresno is located in eastern Fort Bend County at (29.526728, -95.459849). The eastern edge of Fresno is the Brazoria County line. Downtown Houston is to the north, the center of Missouri City is to the northwest, the center of Pearland is to the east, and Manvel is to the southeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Fresno CDP has a total area of , of which of it is land and , or 1.35%, is water. History A settler from Fresno, California, reportedly chose the name. The town is on land patented in 1880 once surrounded by cotton plantations. Fresno acquired a post office in 1910. In 1914 it had a telephone connection, a general store, a hardware store, and a population of 32. By 1933 the town had only ten inhabitants and one business. In 1936 it had three rows of dwellings on both sides of a paved highway (old Hwy 288, present day FM 521) and was served by the International-Great Northern Railroad. By 1946 the population had risen to 100, a level maintained throughout the 1960s. In 1970 the figure had increased to 120; two years later it had grown to 161. During the 1970s and 1980s the population of Fresno increased more rapidly as the area was affected by growth of Houston.  Growth in the 1990s and 2000s  With its prime location on FM 521 and north of State Highway 6 in unincorporated Fort Bend County, developers have recently built large bedroom communities over what was once forest and grazing land, and a number of first-time homeowners have made the Fresno area home. The demographics in the Fresno area have changed dramatically since the last United States Census in 2000 due to a large increase in home building. The area is heavily Democratic in nature, and due to population increases in the area, Fresno was switched from Fort Bend County Precinct Two jurisdiction in 2003 and is now located within Fort Bend County Precinct One, which is located primarily on the western side of Fort Bend County, some away from Fresno, which is located in far eastern Fort Bend County. Among the largest communities in Fresno are the six neighborhoods that make up the Fort Bend MUD #23 area. Teal Run, the oldest of the neighborhoods, was originally started in the 1980s, and development stopped with the Houston oil crash in the late 1980s. Construction in the subdivision started again in 1992. The Estates of Teal Run, located at the intersection of Raab and Sycamore Road, was started in 1999. Teal Run North (Villages of Teal Run and Teal Run Meadows), located just off Teal Bend Boulevard, directly adjacent to both Teal Run and Teal Run Estates, was started in 2001. There are over 3,100 total homes in the Fort Bend MUD #23 area in 2006. NewPoint Estates, located across from Teal Run on Highway 6 and Darby Road, is an area for acreage-type home sites, stables and expensive properties. A number of Houston area professional athletes make this neighborhood home. Winfield Lakes, which is located on Trammel Fresno Road, was started in 2004. Andover Farms, which is located on Highway 6 and South Post Oak Road, was started in 2004. Cambridge Falls, a David Weekley homes site located next to Winfield Lakes, started with infrastructure additions (lights, gas, water, sewer lines, streets) in 2005 and has built many spec homes, which are now available for purchase. The newly built Fort Bend Tollway has given eastern Fort Bend County residents another option of travel into the city of Houston, as the Tollway is long from Highway 6 to U.S. Highway 90 in southwest Houston, and eventually will travel all the way to Loop 610. The average commute time for those living in eastern Fort Bend County using the full route from Highway 6 to Loop 610 (when it opens) should average 20 minutes. A typical trip down FM 521, which turns into Almeda in Houston, or State Highway 288 north into the Texas Medical Center, takes at least 30‚Äì45 minutes in rush hour traffic.

History In 1822, a group of Austin's colonists went up the Brazos River, stopping near present-day Richmond where they built a fort called \\"Fort Bend\\". Named after Richmond, England, the town was among the 19 cities first incorporated by the short-lived Republic of Texas, in 1837. Early residents of the city include many prominent figures in Texas lore such as Jane Long, Deaf Smith, and Mirabeau Lamar, who are all buried in Richmond. On August 16, 1889, the town was the site of the \\"Battle of Richmond\\", an armed fight culminating the Jaybird‚ÄìWoodpecker War, a violent feud over post-Reconstruction political control of Fort Bend County. The mayor from 1949 until his death in 2012 was Hilmar Moore. Historically Richmond had government agencies and nonprofit organizations, while most of the area private businesses were located in Rosenberg.Kever, Jeannie. \\"Neighborhoods / Memories of home / Quiet pleasures are at hear of Richmond neighborhood.\\" Houston Chronicle.

The population was 2,662 at the 2010 census, up from 2,286 at the 2000 census. History Mount Vernon started as a settlement near the Fanning Springs (on Holbrook Street south of the present town square). Affidavits filed to establish land titles soon after the Texas Revolution document the settlement by squatters in Spanish Texas commencing in 1818. By 1848 the United States government established a post office, and in 1849 a formal town site was laid out on land donated by Stephen and Rebecca Keith for the town of Mount Vernon. Since there were two other Mount Vernons in Texas, the post office was called \\"Keith\\" and then \\"Lone Star\\" before the name \\"Mount Vernon\\" became available in 1875. Franklin County was carved out of Titus County in 1875, and Mount Vernon was elected county seat in competition with other communities. The county's economy was based in agriculture with corn and cotton, followed by over 500,000 peach trees in production in the 1920s, watermelons in the 1930s, and the state's top record production of cane syrup in the 1940s. The 1936 discovery of oil on C.G. Hughes' land in the north part of the county led to a more diversified economy, with oil production continuing today combined with light industry, manufacturing, and diverse agricultural endeavors. Mount Vernon, as county seat, was assured a continuing vital existence as the economic center for the county. The town boasted churches, doctors, lawyers, and many varied stores in a time before people had the ability to travel far. The town voted to incorporate in 1910 under a mayor/council form of government. In 1911 a bond issue was passed to create a public waterworks. Electric and gas utility service followed. The downtown area reflects a small-town atmosphere. The central plaza has a picturesque gazebo and park benches. On the north side of the square is a classical revival 1912 white limestone courthouse with a chiming clock tower.

The population was 2,417 at the 2010 census. History A post office at the home of S.J. Blythe occupied the area known as Blythe, Texas. In 1917 the Santa Fe railroad moved into the vicinity, but the rail company ran into a problem. Santa Fe already had one town by the name located in Blythe, California. The company decided to change the name of this new location to honor Charles L. Seagraves, an employee who worked as a traveling agent and was favored by local residents. The Spearman Land Company building was the first building to be erected, and the Higginbotham Bartlett Lumber Company followed shortly thereafter. Seagraves grew rapidly as a town, and in 1928 suffered a fire that burned a major portion of the business section. The only building left standing on the west side of Main Street was the Seagraves Motor Company, which led to the rebuilding of modern brick buildings, many of which remain today.http://www.seminoletxchamber.org/?content_id=13 Geography Seagraves is located at .

The population was 8,619 at the 2010 census. Bacliff, originally called Clifton-by-the-Sea, began as a seaside resort town. Located on the western shore of Galveston Bay, Bacliff, along with San Leon and Bayview, are the largest unincorporated communities on the Galveston County mainland. The Bacliff CDP is home to the Kenneth E. Little Elementary school and Bayshore Park, created from land donated by Texas Genco.\\"Utility to Donate Land for County Park.\\" The Galveston County Daily News, 14 Dec. 2005. Web. 05 May 2013.

Telephone service came to Clifton-by-the-Sea in 1913, and Grand Avenue (FM 646) became the main street. Hurricanes, Galveston's recovery after the Hurricane of 1900, and rapid transportation diminished Clifton-by-the-Sea's popularity. The hurricane of 1915 destroyed many of the improvements to the area, but by 1924 the bathhouse and pavilion had been restored and summer residents returned to the community. A fire destroyed the pavilion in 1929 and it was rebuilt and hosted numerous summer concerts by both the Galveston and Houston orchestras. The hurricane of 1943 caused major damage to the area and the bathhouse and pavilion were not rebuilt. In 1933, Clifton-by-the-Sea was home to 50 residents and 2 businesses, and from 1940 to 1949 it was home to 100 residents and 4 businesses. After World War II the area expanded as it became home for workers of the nearby petrochemical plants. The expansion of the area required the establishment of a post office in 1948. The U.S. Postal Service refused to allow the name Clifton-by-the-Sea to be used due to its length, and the name Clifton was already in use by another Texas town, so the residents chose the same name as the subdivision at the center of business, Bay Cliff, as a replacement. However, the name was misspelled on the postal paperwork as Bacliff. The new name had only seven letters so it was admissible.Bradfield, p. 12. \\"Gator\\" Miller, former publisher of the Seabreeze, said that in the 1950s the Galveston Daily News bought a large parcel of land and awarded free lots to subscribers; people who canceled subscriptions lost their homesites, which were given to other subscribers. Miller said that this resulted in confused titles and a lack of large business; Miller said that a retailer would not wish to buy land in Bacliff and then discover that an individual claimed title to the land. In 1964, Houston Lighting and Power began construction on two 450 MW electric generating units in Bacliff as part of the company's Project Enterprise expansion. The units were of supercritical boiler design, which was then a new technology. The power plant, originally known as the Bacliff Plant, was renamed the P. H. Robinson plant, in honor of company president Perk H. Robinson.Beck, Bill. At Your Service: An Illustrated History of Houston Lighting & Power Company. Houston, TX: Gulf Print., 1990. Print. In the 1970s and 1980s there was a dispute over the valuation of the power plant between HL&P; and the Dickinson Independent School District (DISD). In 1979 HL&P; said the plant was worth $238 million but DISD's board of equalization said it was worth over $242 million. A legal dispute ensued between the two agencies.Loe, Victoria. \\"Power Play.\\" Texas Monthly. Emmis Communications. August 1981. Volume 9, Issue 8. p. 98.

Proponents wanted a local police force and the ability to pass ordinances. Opponents said that the tax base was too small to support municipal services including police and road and drainage improvements. By 1986, the community became a bedroom community for workers commuting to jobs in the area; during that year the Bacliff community had 4,851 residents and 19 businesses. In 1986, residents in Bacliff and Bayview considered incorporating into a general law city. Supporters said that incorporation would establish more local control over affairs, an area police department, and the ability to pass ordinances. Opponents said that the area's tax base could not sufficiently support municipal service, including police protection and road and drainage improvements. At the time the area of considering incorporation had 7,000 people. Galveston County Judge Ray Holbrook signed an order setting the date of the election as Saturday, August 9, 1986, and releasing the area from the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Kemah, League City, and Texas City. In 1986, the Bacliff and Bayview area received water and sewer services from two municipal utility districts; if the incorporation measure had passed the districts would have likely remained. Donna Maples, vice president of the Bacliff-Bayview Community Association, supported the incorporation measure. The officials overseeing the election described turnout as \\"heavy.\\" Officials announced that the incorporation proposal failed on a 770 to 163 count. In 2000, in Bacliff there were 6,692 people organized into 2,523 households. That year Bacliff and San Leon formed a nine member board to prepare the communities for incorporation.

The population was 2,417 at the 2010 census. The communities of Port Bolivar, Crystal Beach, Caplen, Gilchrist, and High Island are located on Bolivar Peninsula. History The peninsula was named in 1816 for Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the famed Venezuelan political leader involved in the independence movements of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and other Latin American nations. The pirates/privateers Jean Laffite and Louis-Michel Aury each used the Bolivar Peninsula as part of the pirate kingdom established around the Galveston Bay. The peninsula was part of an overland slave route between Louisiana and Galveston. James Long based his operations on the peninsula since 1819 with the first establishment of Bolivar Peninsula, and Fort Las Casas was built in 1820. Samuel D. Parr was responsible for starting the settlement in 1838 that would later become Port Bolivar. The Point Bolivar Lighthouse (which is now privately owned and not open to the public) has an important history with the peninsula, built in 1872. The lighthouse is located on the western end of the peninsula, directly across from Fort Travis Seashore Park. Fort Travis in Bolivar Peninsula, a separate facility from Fort Travis in Galveston, was built with construction starting in 1898. The North Jetty, extending from Bolivar Peninsula, of the entrance to Galveston Bay started being constructed in 1874. From 1896 to 1942, the Gulf & Interstate, a subsidiary of Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, connected Beaumont to Galveston Island with aid of train ferries. At one time the Bolivar Peninsula was called the \\"breadbasket of Galveston\\" and the \\"watermelon capital of Texas\\". Crystal Beach was incorporated from 1971 until 1987, and it has been the most populated community of the Bolivar Peninsula. On April 23, 1991, communities of Bolivar Peninsula received an enhanced 9-1-1 system which routes calls to proper dispatchers and allows dispatchers to automatically view the address of the caller.\\"News briefs.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Hurricane Ike Damage, Reconstruction, and Memorial - Feb 28 2009 At 7:10 UST on September 13, 2008 (2:10 AM local), Hurricane Ike made landfall at the east end of Galveston Island, Texas as the largest North Atlantic hurricane in recorded history.NOAA - National Climatic Data Center (U.S. Department of Commerce) At the height of the storm, Ike's cloud mass essentially covered the entire Gulf of Mexico. The Wind and Surge Destructive Potential Classification Scale, which was detailed in Tropical Cyclone Destructive Potential by Integrated Kinetic Energy (by Dr. Mark Powell and Dr. Tim Reinhold, April 2007) offers a new way to assess hurricane size and strength by calculating the total kinetic energy contained in a 1-meter deep horizontal slice of the storm at an elevation of 10 meters above the land or ocean surface. Using this type of calculation, the integrated kinetic energy was calculated for Ike and was found to be 25 percent greater than the comparable maximum estimate for Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Ike Wind and Surge Destructive Potential Destruction of the Peninsula Hurricane Ike caused cataclysmic destruction of the peninsula, reducing the region to rubble and causing severe, permanent change in the shoreline. Entire communities along the upper Texas coast were simply wiped out by Ike's catastrophic storm surge.Houston Weather: Ike's Aftermath Ike's effects were disproportionally felt near the long, low-lying Bolivar Peninsula which has typical elevations around 2 m. Despite being only a strong category 2 storm with maximum winds at landfall of 95 knots (49 m/s, Berg, 2009), Ike's extremely large, long-lasting surge and waves devastated the peninsula. In Gilchrist, Texas, NOAA aerial photography reveals complete destruction. The Rollover Pass bridge was reduced to one lane. Of the 1,000 buildings in Gilchrist, 99.5% of them were knocked off of their foundations. Of the buildings off of the foundations, the storm demolished some and washed others onto swamplands behind Gilchrist.Connelly, Richard. \\"Goodbye, Gilchrist.\\" Houston Press. September 17, 2008. The Bolivar Peninsula was just to the right of landfall, placing it on the strong side of the hurricane. H Wind reconstructions (Powell et al., 1998) show winds blowing strongly from offshore-to-onshore for most of the storm, which acted to increase both surge and waves. Surge is extremely important for the particular case of the Bolivar Peninsula, as it allowed large waves to penetrate inland into areas they could not otherwise have reached. Shoreline erosion was around 75 m, which undermined the piled foundations of oceanfront buildings. Most other houses in this area were reduced to either piles or slabs by large waves riding on surge, with only a very few remaining more or less intact. Peak coastal surges reached . Water depths of at least covered all of the Bolivar Peninsula, with most areas covered by at least of water (not including wave action). Much of the southern part of Chambers County was also inundated by at least of water. According to post-storm analyses by both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division and Applied Research Associates (ARA), a research and engineering company, the best estimates of 3-second peak wind gusts along the eastern portion of the peninsula were between 110 mph and 115 mph. Research observations also suggest most of eastern and southeastern Texas was subjected to tropical storm and hurricane- force winds for ten hours, and possibly longer.Ike Technical ReportWaves, Surge and Damage on the Bolivar Peninsula During Hurricane Ike Cindy Horswell of McClatchy - Tribune Business News said that authorities said that 3,600 structures on the peninsula, 62% of them, were destroyed or severely damaged by Ike's storm surge.Horswell, Cindy. \\"Holes left in wake of storms: Ike hit before some Texas communities recovered from Rita.\\" McClatchy - Tribune Business News.

Its service area is the entire peninsula. This site is a part of the Holy Family Parish, which has other sites on Galveston Island. Our Mother of Mercy Church in Port Bolivar was established circa 1950. Crystal Beach formerly had St. Theresa of Liseaux Mission, built in 1994. St. Theresa sustained damage during Hurricane Ike in 2008, and due to the damage the archdiocese had it razed. Our Lady By The Sea was built on its site. Our Mother of Mercy was undamaged, but it remained closed after the hurricane and the archdiocese had it demolished anyway. Between Hurricane Ike and the opening of Our Lady by the Sea, Bolivar residents attended church in Galveston or in Winnie. John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press wrote that the Our Lady church, dedicated in 2010 and on the site of the former St Therese of Lisieux, \\"effectively consolidates\\" the two former churches. Residents opposed to the demolition of Our Mother of Mercy expressed a negative reception to the opening of Our Lady by the Sea.

Geography Map of Kemah Kemah is located in the northeast corner of Galveston County at (29.5425, -95.0203) and is part of the Clear Lake Area. It is bordered to the west and south by League City, to the northwest by Clear Lake Shores, to the southeast by unincorporated Bacliff, and at its northern end by Seabrook across the Clear Creek Channel in Harris County. Texas State Highway 146 leads through the center of Kemah, leading north to Baytown and south to Texas City. Galveston is to the south, and Houston is to the northwest. According to the United States Census Bureau, Kemah has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.55%, are water. History The land, measuring approximately , was the basis for a town that would be called Kemah. This land was granted to one of the first colonists who was a farmer and stockraiser, Michael Gouldrich, on August 24, 1824. Gouldrich's land was located near Clear Creek and Galveston Bay. However, after Gouldrich disappeared, William Vince from Harris County acquired Gouldrich's Clear Creek land. Afterwards John Flanders, an Alamo fighter who was not supposed to have taken any land, bought the property from William Vince and it was renamed \\"Flanders Grove\\" or \\"Flanders Labor\\". When Flanders died at the age of 36, Allen Vince, of Vince's Bayou, was appointed executor of Flanders' estate in 1841. On May 28, 1844, there was a petition to sell the land to pay off debts. Soon after, the land was appraised for $2 an acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters. He bought the Clear Creek land on July 2, 1844, for $354. After October 1850, Waters sold of the Clear Creek property to various people, but Henry Kipp eventually owned the land. During the 1890s, the Bradford and Kipp families moved to the area and portioned off the land into town lots in 1898, thus establishing the town known as \\"Evergreen\\". It was located along the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, and the area was also called \\"Shell Siding\\" for the oyster shell middens lining the bay, in some places deep. After the 1900 Galveston hurricane, when the majority of the towns around Galveston Bay were destroyed, the Kipp and Bradford families were forced to evacuate, but later moved back to Evergreen in 1901. They rebuilt and restored the town, making two-story homes with porches for themselves on 10th street. In order for there to be a post office in the town, the name had to be changed because there was already a town called Evergreen. The name \\"Kemah\\" was chosen with the Karankawa Indian word meaning \\"wind in my face\\". In 1907, John H. Kipp Sr. established a post office in the newly named town of Kemah. From the 1920s to the 1950s Kemah became a significant tourist destination resulting from investment by the Maceo crime syndicate which ran Galveston during this time. The syndicate created a lavish casino district along the boardwalk featuring venues such as the Chili Bowl and the Kemah Den. During the 1950s the state Attorney General and the Texas Rangers finally shut down the Galveston vice empire. Kemah's casinos were closed and its tourism base declined drastically. During the 1950s a major commercial shrimp fishing fleet was established in the town as the Clear Creek Channel was opened. Though Hurricane Carla severely damaged the city in 1961, the city rebuilt and the fishing business revived. During the 1970s, in part as a result of the establishment of the Johnson Space Center on Clear Lake, tourism began to re- emerge as pleasure boats began to fill the lake. On October 22, 1966, the town of Kemah adopted Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes and became a General Law City. In 1992, the city expanded to , or , and the population increased to 1,300 residents. In the late 1990s, Kemah continued to expand and began to be known as a tourist and recreational hot spot. This occurred when Landry's Restaurants opened the Kemah Boardwalk. The boardwalk now includes amusement rides for tourists and residents to enjoy. The boardwalk also has numerous restaurants, mainly owned and operated by Landry's Restaurants, Inc. The boardwalk also gives guests the opportunity to stay in Kemah at the Boardwalk Inn, and to shop at the local retail shops and kiosks. House in Kemah that was struck by Hurricane Ike in 2008 On the morning of September 13, 2008, a Category 2 hurricane named Ike made landfall in Galveston County. Although the hurricane caused more damage to Galveston, Kemah still felt the effects of the storm. Hurricane Ike caused power outages in Kemah, destruction of homes and business, and streets to be piled with trees and debris. However, most importantly, the storm surge affected the Kemah Boardwalk the most. Although it did not take Landry's long to start to rebuild the tourist attraction, a waterline in the Landry's Restaurant is a reminder of the devastating hurricane.

The city population in 2010 was 14,509. It is a part of the Houston- The Woodlands- Sugar Land metropolitan area. La Marque experienced considerable growth in the 1950s, during which the city provided a general administrative and trades and crafts workforce helping to support the petrochemical complex in adjoining Texas City. It is the hometown of U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Norman Bulaich. History Paul's Union Church, La Marque, Texas The La Marque water tower La Marque, also once known as Highlands and Buttermilk Junction, is an incorporated residential community on Interstate Highway 45, State Highway 3, and Farm Roads 519, 1765, and 2004, some 12 miles northwest of Galveston in northwestern Galveston County. The community was originally known as Highlands, probably for its location near Highland Creek, and was renamed in the 1890s when residents learned of another mainland community of the same name. Madam St. Ambrose, a French Catholic Ursuline Sister and postmistress, chose the new name, which in French means \\"the mark\\". The community's post office operated from 1887 until the 1930s. During the Civil War, the town was known as Buttermilk Junction after the soldiers' practice of purchasing buttermilk there on the trip between Galveston and Houston. In 1867, the town had six families and its residents raised cattle or rice. The local population rose from 100 in 1890 to 175 in 1896, when the community had a Baptist church and several fruit growers. A school with 14 students existed before 1895, when Amos Stewart gave land for a larger facility. By 1909, two teachers served an enrollment of 55 students, and in 1913, further construction began. By 1914, the community had been reached by four railroads: the International and Great Northern; the Galveston, Houston and Henderson; the Missouri, Kansas and Texas; and the Interurban. At that time, La Marque had both a railroad station and general store located in a private home. The town's population reached 500 in 1914 and 1,500 by 1952, when it had 90 businesses. As it grew together with nearby Texas City, La Marque served as a residential community for employees at nearby industrial facilities (e.g., chemical plants and refineries) in the La Marque-Texas City area, as well as the Galveston Island Medical Center. The town had a population of 17,000 and 130 businesses in 1977. In 1988, it had 15,697 residents and 158 businesses, and in 1991, some 14,258 residents and 272 businesses. In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including La Marque. This meant an influx of children from the Galveston Independent School District into other school districts. In spite of this fact, the number of children enrolled in the La Marque Independent School District has continued to fall.Schladen, Marty. \\"Forces drive people off island.\\" Galveston County Daily News.

Education La Marque Independent School District was mismanaged for so long that it was finally dissolved, when it was assigned by the commissioner of education an accreditation status of \\"Not Accredited-Revoked\\". By law, a school district that is closed must be annexed into an adjoining district. Accordingly, Texas City, Hitchcock, Dickinson, and Santa Fe school districts jointly absorbed the responsibility of educating La Marque students. Before shutting down the school district, Commissioner of Education Michael Williams gave the La Marque schools ample opportunity and time for improvement. In 2011, the school district was judged \\"academically unacceptable\\". Similarly, in 2013 and 2014, La Marque schools were given a rating of \\"improvement required\\". Finally, an October 2015 review by the TEA found La Marque ISD's rating at \\"substandard achievement\\". This ultimately led to the revocation of the accreditation status. Critics of the school district point out that administrators failed to manage the tax funds properly, failed to hire and train competent instructors, and emphasized sports to the exclusion of academics.

The population was 4,970 at the 2010 census. History During the early 19th century, the pirate Jean Lafitte, who ruled Galveston Island, established a stronghold at Eagle Point in modern San Leon. Eagle Point went on to become an important shipping and trading post for slaves. A community was established, known as Edward's Point and later North Galveston. When the North Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City Railroad was built through the area in 1893, the town began to develop as a commercial center. However, following the hurricanes in 1900 and 1915, the town was devastated and never able to fully recover. Attempts were made in the early 20th century to establish a resort community in the area, but these efforts met with only modest success. Growth and development since this time have been relatively stagnant.

History In 1877, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the western part of Galveston county.SANTA FE, TX  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) By the turn of the century, three small, unincorporated towns had formed along the railway: Alta Loma, Arcadia and Algoa. The Santa Fe Independent School District, named after the railway, was established shortly afterward to serve the area. Santa Fe City Hall In the mid-1970s, the neighboring city of Hitchcock attempted to annex an area in eastern Alta Loma known as the Morningview neighborhood. Amid intense opposition to becoming part of Hitchcock, residents began a petitioning effort to incorporate the area into a new city. On January 21, 1978, a ballot proposal to incorporate Alta Loma and parts of Arcadia passed by a wide margin and the city of Santa Fe was born. Santa Fe has since grown to include all of Arcadia and parts of Algoa, and, ironically, is now twice the size of Hitchcock. On February 14, 1981, the Ku Klux Klan hosted a fish fry on a private farm in Santa Fe to protest the growing presence of Vietnamese shrimpers in the Gulf. During the event, a Vietnamese fishing boat was ceremonially burned.Claudia Kolker, San Francisco Chronicle, 11 September 2000, URL: http://www.sfgate.com:80/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/09/11/MN95611.DTLStill Shrimping: Vietnamese American shrimpers 25 years after the second wave  AsianWeek That controversy, as well as similar conflicts in nearby port towns like Rockport, led to a decision of the United States District Court, S.D.

The population was 5,376 at the 2010 census. History Post is located on the edge of the caprock escarpment of the Llano Estacado, the southeastern edge of the Great Plains. It is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes 84 and 380. The land belonged to John Bunyan Slaughter, as it was on his U Lazy S Ranch. In 1906, Slaughter sold it to Charles William (C. W.) Post, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, who founded \\"Post City\\" as a utopian colonizing venture in 1907. Post devised the community as a model town.Post, Texas profile, Texas State Historical Association He purchased of ranchland and established the Double U Company to manage the town's construction. The company built trim houses and numerous structures, which included the Algerita Hotel, a gin, and a textile plant. They planted trees along every street and prohibited alcoholic beverages and brothels. The Double U Company rented and sold farms and houses to settlers. A post office began in a tent during the year of Post City's founding, being established (with the name Post) July 18, 1907, with Frank L. Curtis as first postmaster.Schmidt, Walter G. (1993) An Encyclopaedia of Texas Post Offices, p. 173, Chicago, Illinois: The Collectors' Club of Chicago. Two years later, the town had a school, a bank, and a newspaper, the Post City Post, the same name as the daily in St. Louis, Missouri. The Garza County paper today is called the Post Dispatch. The railroad reached the town in 1910. The town changed its name to \\"Post\\" when it incorporated in 1914, the year of C. W. Post's death. By then, Post had a population of 1000, 10 retail businesses, a dentist, a physician, a sanitarium, and Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches. From 1910 to 1913, Post experimented with attempts at rainmaking. Explosives were detonated in the atmosphere at timed intervals. Precipitation records, however, showed that the efforts failed.Texas State Travel Guide 2011, p. 131 The C. W. Post estate pledged $75,000, and the town raised $35,000 in 1916 to bid unsuccessfully to become the site of the proposed West Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College. Postex Cotton Mills began production in 1913 with 250 employees. When the Post interests sold the business in 1945 to Ely and Walker Dry Goods Company of St. Louis, the plant was producing six million yards of cloth a year and employed 375 workers who manufactured Postex cotton sheets and Garza pillow cases. Ely and Walker sold Postex in 1955 to Burlington Industries, the world's largest textile manufacturer at that time. By 1973, the company employed 450 persons. The mill has since closed. Oilfield service companies have been important to the economy, as have farming and ranching. In 1989, Post had two libraries, a hospital, a nursing home, an airport, the Post Dispatch (founded 1926), and 90 businesses. The population reached 3,400 in 1928, declined to 2,000 in 1940, and increased to 3,100 during the 1950s. With the development of the local oil industry, the town's population attained its highest level of 4,800 in 1964. The 1980 census showed a population of 3,864, but by 1988, the Texas Almanac reported 4,162. In 1990, the population was 3,768. The former sanitarium in Post is preserved as the Garza County Historical Museum. It is located to the right rear of the courthouse. Linda G. Puckett is the museum director. Many ranchers and civic boosters live in Garza County, among them Giles McCrary, a former mayor who until his death in 2011 operated the OS Museum, a hybrid of exhibits from both the American West and Asia, which are changed three times per year.

History=Spain In 1747, the Spanish government sent Jos√© de Escand√≥n to inspect the northern frontier of its North American colonies, including Spanish Texas. In his final report, Escand√≥n recommended the Presidio La Bah√≠a be moved from its Guadalupe River location to the banks of the San Antonio River, so it could better assist settlements along the Rio Grande.Roell (1994), p. 13 Both the presidio and the mission which it protected, Mission Nuestra Se√±ora del Esp√≠ritu Santo de Z√∫√±iga, moved to their new location sometime around October 1749. Escand√≥n proposed that 25 Mexican families be relocated near the presidio to form a civilian settlement, but he was unable to find enough willing settlers.Roell (1994), p. 14 With the conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, France ceded Louisiana and its Texas claims to Spain.Weber (1992), p. 198 With France no longer a threat to the Crown's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubi to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future.Chipman (1992), p. 173 Rubi recommended that several presidios be closed, but that La Bahia be kept and rebuilt in stone. La Bahia was soon \\"the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River\\".Roell (1994), p. 15 The presidio was at the crossroads of several major trade and military routes. It quickly became one of the three most important areas in Texas, alongside B√©xar and Nacogdoches. A civil settlement, then known as La Bahia, soon developed near the presidio. By 1804, the settlement had one of only two schools in Texas.Roell (1994), p. 19 In early August 1812, during the Mexican War of Independence, Mexican revolutionary Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara and his recruits, called the Republican Army of the North, invaded Texas.Almar√°z (1971), p. 159 In November the invaders captured Presidio La Bahia.Almar√°z (1971), p. 164 For the next four months, Texas governor Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo laid siege to the fort.Roell (1994), p. 20 Unable to win a decisive victory, Salcedo lifted the siege on February 19, 1813, and turned toward San Antonio de Bexar.Almar√°z (1971), p. 168 The rebels controlled the presidio until July or August 1813, when Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Arredondo led royalist troops in retaking all of Texas.Roell (1994), p. 21 Henry Perry, a member of the Republican Army of the North, led forces back to Texas in 1817 and attempted to recapture La Bahia. The Spanish reinforced the presidio with soldiers from San Antonio, and defeated Perry's forces on June 18 near Coleto Creek.Roell (1994), p. 21 The area was invaded again in 1821. The United States and Spain had signed the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty in 1819, which ceded all US territorial claims on the Texas area to Spain. On October 4, the Long Expedition (with 52 members) captured La Bahia. Four days later, Colonel Ignacio P√©rez arrived with troops from Bexar, and Long surrendered.Roell (1994), p. 23 By the end of 1821, Mexico had achieved its independence from Spain, and Texas became part of the newly created country.Weber (1992), p. 300 Mexico In 1829, the name of the Mexican Texas village of La Bah√≠a was changed to \\"Goliad\\", believed to be an anagram of Hidalgo (omitting the silent initial \\"H\\"), in honor of the patriot priest Miguel Hidalgo, the father of the Mexican War of Independence.Jeri Robison Turner, \\"GOLIAD, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hjg05 ), (Texas State Historical Association), accessed April 16, 2011. On October 9, 1835, in the early days of the Texas Revolution, a group of Anglo-American immigrants attacked the presidio in the Battle of Goliad. The Mexican garrison quickly surrendered, leaving the Anglo-Americans in control of the fort. The first declaration of independence of the Republic of Texas was signed here on December 20, 1835. Anglo-Americans held the area until March 1836, when their garrison under Colonel James Fannin was defeated at the nearby Battle of Coleto. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, then President of Mexico, ordered that all survivors were to be executed. On Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, in what was later called the Goliad Massacre, 303 were marched out of the fort to be executed, and 39 were executed inside the presidio (20 prisoners were spared because they were either physicians or medical attendants); 342 men were killed and 28 escaped.Hardin (1994), p. 174 The famous Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza was born in Goliad in 1829. He commanded the forces resisting the French Army in the Battle of Puebla, now celebrated as Cinco de Mayo on May 5, 1862.\\"ZARAGOZA, IGNACIO SEGUIN,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fza04 ) (Texas State Historical Association), accessed April 15, 2011.

The population was 7,237 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat. Its primary real estate, in its historic downtown, economically depends on lodging oil field workers from the nearby Eagle Ford Shale, alongside visiting tourists. History Come and Take It mural Gonzales is one of the earliest Anglo-American settlements in Texas, the first west of the Colorado River. It was established by Empresario Green DeWitt as the capital of his colony in August 1825. DeWitt named the community for Rafael Gonz√°les, governor of Coahuila y Tejas. Informally, the community was known as the DeWitt Colony. The original settlement (located where Highway 90-A crosses Kerr Creek) was abandoned in 1826 after two Indian attacks. It was rebuilt nearby in 1827. The town remains today as it was originally surveyed. Gonzales is referred to as the \\"Lexington of Texas\\" because it was the site of the first skirmish of the Texas Revolution. In 1831, the Mexican government had granted Green DeWitt's request for a small cannon for protection against Indian attacks. At the outbreak of disputes between the Anglo settlers and the Mexican authorities in 1835, a contingent of more than 100 Mexican soldiers was sent from San Antonio to retrieve the cannon. When the soldiers arrived, only 18 men were in Gonzales, but they refused to return the cannon, and men from the surrounding area soon joined them. Texians under the command of John Henry Moore confronted them. Sarah DeWitt and her daughter sewed a flag bearing the likeness of the cannon and the words \\"Come and Take It\\", which was flown when the first shots of Texian independence were fired on October 2, 1835. The Texians successfully resisted the Mexican troops in what became known as the Battle of Gonzales.Davis (2006), p. 142. Gonzales later contributed 32 men from the Gonzales Ranging Company to the defense of the Alamo.Edmondson (2000), p. 340. It was the only city to send aid to the Alamo, and all 32 men lost their lives defending the site. Susanna Dickinson, widow of one of the Alamo defenders, and Joe, the slave of William B. Travis, fled to Gonzales with news of the Alamo massacre. General Sam Houston was there organizing the Texas forces. He anticipated the town would be the next target of General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's Mexican army. Gathering the Texians at Peach Creek east of town, under the Sam Houston Oak, Houston ordered Gonzales burned, to deny it to the enemy. He began a retreat toward the U.S. border. The widows and orphans of Gonzales and their neighbors were forced to flee, thus precipitating the Runaway Scrape. The town was derelict immediately after the Texas Revolution, but was eventually rebuilt on the original site in the early 1840s. By 1850, the town had a population of 300. The population rose to 1,703 by time of the 1860 census, 2,900 by the mid-1880s, and 4,297 in 1900. Part of the growth of the late 19th century can be attributed to the arrival of various immigrants, among them Jews, many of whom became peddlers and merchants.Gonzales, Texas; \\"Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities\\" online; accessed May 2018 Geography Gonzales is located in central Gonzales County at (29.508801, ‚àí97.447709), on the northeast side of the Guadalupe River, just east of the mouth of the San Marcos River.

Historic monuments and buildings The site of the Battle of Gonzales, in the village of Cost, off Highway 97, is marked by a handsome stone and bronze monument commissioned by the State of Texas in 1910. The Come and Take It monument is the work of the Italian-born San Antonio artist Pompeo Coppini, Texas' leading sculptor in his day. The Gonzales County Courthouse (1896), on the National Register of Historic Places, is by the master of Texas courthouses, James Riely Gordon. Winning a country-wide competition for the Bexar County Courthouse in San Antonio launched Gordon's career, as the first of 72 courthouses, 18 of them in Texas (with 12 remaining in this state). J. Riely Gordon was also a master of the Romanesque Revival style, hugely popular in the 1890s, and seen here with good effect. Historic houses Gonzales has an exceptionally high concentration of historic houses and buildings. In 2012, This Old House named Gonzales as one of the Best Old House Neighborhoods, noting its well-preserved downtown, its large stock of affordable and fixer- upper fine houses in Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, Italianate, and Greek Revival styles, as well as the town's low cost of living and convenience to the big cities of Austin, San Antonio, and Houston. The oldest dwellings in Gonzales date to the mid-19th century, but most of the architecturally notable houses were constructed beginning in the late Victorian period, from about 1880 to about 1915. Queen Anne style houses are the most common, with Colonial Revival and Classical Revival houses as well. J. Riely Gordon and Atlee B. Ayers were among the renowned architects active here. Many of the most notable homes, built for the important families of Gonzales, were erected along St. Louis St. and St. Lawrence St. Those two roads edge, to the south and north, a long stretch of public land one block wide running from the historic downtown commercial center and courthouse all the way to Kerr Creek to the east. {C.T.

It is part of the Pampa, Texas micropolitan statistical area. Its population was 497 at the 2010 census. History The area around modern Lefors was near the heart of Comancheria and a common village site for the nomadic tribes of Comanche. Randolph Marcy's 1852 expedition passed this way. The Battle of the North Fork of the Red River, between the U.S. Army under the command of Ranald Slidell Mackenzie and the Comanche, was fought near here on September 29, 1872. Cheyenne chief Grey Beard's band was attacked near here in 1874 by the U.S. Army. Lefors was founded in 1888 by Travis Leach, Perry LeFors, Henry Thut, and Henry B. Lovett. The town was named for Perry LeFors, who traveled with his father to the Panhandle in 1878 and later became foreman of the Diamond F Ranch, a part of the Francklyn Land and Cattle Company, which became insolvent in 1886 and became the White Deer Lands Trust Company, of which Timothy Dwight Hobart was the agent. In 1882, the first homestead on the future townsite was laid by Travis Leach, a rancher and surveyor, whose log cabin served as a stagecoach stop on the mail route from Fort Elliott and Mobeetie to Tascosa. Henry B. Lovett, a former buffalo hunter, and Henry Thut, a Swiss immigrant whose sister-in-law, Emma Lang, married LeFors, also settled in the vicinity during the 1880s. George Henry Saunders had a ranch camp headquarters nearby. Other settlers soon moved into the area, and in 1892, a post office was opened at Lefors with Thut as postmaster. (Postal officials required that the F be lower-cased.) Four years later, a combination school and church building was built. When Gray County was organized on May 27, 1902, Lefors was named the county seat. A two-story frame courthouse was built for less than $2,500, and Thut, who became the first county treasurer, erected a hotel. Perry LeFors served as the town's first constable. The population reached 150 in 1910, and despite its small size and the lack of a railroad, the town managed for a time to remain the county seat. When the oil boom hit the county during the 1920s, three oil pools were discovered in the vicinity. Lefors profited from the boom, especially in real estate; the boom resulted in the establishment of an independent school district and the bringing of electricity and other modern utilities to the town. By 1931, Lefors had incorporated, and in 1932, the town finally obtained a railroad, when the Fort Worth and Denver extended its line from Pampa. The population increased to 809 by 1940. Several Protestant denominations established churches in the community. Eight people died when an early spring snowstorm stranded about 100 people in around 55 automobiles on the road between Pampa and Lefors on April 7‚Äì8, 1938. After between 10 and 12 inches of snow fell in the Panhandle, with 50-mile-an-hour winds creating drifts 5-25 tall, men with farm tractors and heavy oilfield equipment had to come to the rescue of the snowed-in travelers, which included two school buses rescued by the army. The town suffered a flood in 1961, unemployment from the closure of several area carbon black plants in 1964, and a tornado in 1975. Geography Lefors is located at (35.438787, -100.803721).

The White Deer Land Company Museum, which showcases ranching exhibits, is located in downtown Pampa.Texas Department of Transportation, Texas State Travel Guide, 2007, p. 128 History In 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad was constructed through the area where Pampa would be established. A rail station and telegraph office were built, and the townsite was laid out by George Tyng, manager of the White Deer Lands ranch. The town was first called \\"Glasgow\\", then \\"Sutton\\", and then the name was changed to \\"Pampa\\" after the pampas grasslands of South America at Mr. Tyng's suggestion. Timothy Dwight Hobart, a native of Vermont, sold plots of land for the town only to people who agreed to settle there and develop the land, and Pampa soon became a center for agriculture. Gas and oil were discovered in the Texas Panhandle in 1916. Pampa prospered greatly in the resulting oil boom, and the Gray County seat of government was moved in 1928 from Lefors to Pampa.History of Pampa By the 1920s, Pampa was linked by rail to Hemphill County and Clinton, Oklahoma, through the combination of two similarly named companies, the Clinton, Oklahoma, and Western Railroad Company and the Clinton-Oklahoma- Western Railroad Company of Texas. Both of these companies were soon leased and purchased by the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway, which held them until disestablishment in 1965.

Library The Lovett Memorial Library was built on the entire west half of the 100 block of North Houston Street. The building was dedicated on 18 January 1955. In 1985, the Harrington Foundation of Amarillo paid for the computerization of library records, joining the library for the first time into a consortium with most of the public libraries in the Panhandle.

In 1996, the Lovett Library Foundation, which managed the Holland bequest and several other substantial bequests, announced that a plan was being made to extensive renovate the old building. In January 1998, the library staff, along with all books and much equipment, moved from the Houston Street facility to the old B. M. Baker school on the south side, where the library was set up in the cafeteria and classroom annex in the south part of the school complex. This freed the old building on Houston Street for renovation. The children's area was moved to the second floor; a bridge was built between the second floor facility and other children's rooms in the south part of the building; an elevator was installed; new shelves, lighting, and ceiling tiles were installed; and the building was made completely ADA compliant. In June 2003, it was announced that R. L. Franklin, prominent rancher of Pampa, would donate two statues to the library to honor the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building in January 1955. One statue, by Don Ray of Channing, represents a seated woman reading to a child; this is erected in front of the library. Another statue representing a Pioneer Woman was by David Frech of New York was placed in the library's Reading Garden. Both statues were dedicated to four local women, including the donor's mother, each of whom had a long involvement with the library. The statues were dedicated on 9 January 2005, and at one of the dedicatory events, author Elmer Kelton was the guest speaker.

History Gunter was founded in 1902 (other sources report 1901, with a post office as early as 1898) when the family of John (a/k/a Jot) Gunter deeded for the original townsite, near the intersection of current State Highway 289 and Farm to Market Road 121. The first residence was established in 1903 by Albert Earthman, who would later charter the First National Bank in Gunter. A second bank, the First State Bank, would later open. Gunter steadily grew until 1924, when the First State Bank (having outlasted the First National Bank) closed its doors, leaving many businessmen and farmers in financial ruin. The Great Depression and two devastating fires in 1930 and 1948 further damaged the local economy. However, Gunter began to grow again in the 1950s, and experienced its greatest growth in the last two decades, growing 37% in population during the 1990s. Gunter has started to experience overflow growth from the northern Metroplex suburbs, due to its location on State Highway 289 approximately north of Celina, as well as its proximity to the Sherman - Denison metropolitan area and nearby Lake Texoma.

The population was 2,600 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Sherman-Denison metropolitan statistical area. History A 1910 map of Howe The first settlers in the area arrived around the time of the Texas Revolution in 1836. In 1843, the last Indian battle in Grayson County was said to have been fought in the area. The first settlers of Howe were Jabez and Harriet Haning, and Jabez's brother John. They received land through the Peters colony after their arrival from Pennsylvania before 1850. The Houston and Texas Central Railway built through the area in 1873, and a railroad switch was located in the community. It was called \\"Summit\\" because at above sea level, it was supposed to be the highest point between the Red River and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1873, when Summit received a post office, two businesses were located at the switch - a general store and a saloon. Several houses were built to the east of the switch. Jabez Haning persuaded the railroad to establish a depot on his land by donating every second lot in his newly platted town to the railroad. The names of the depot, the store, and the post office were changed in 1876 to \\"Howe\\", after F. M. Howe, who worked for the Houston and Texas Central. Howe had three saloons until around 1900, when the town voted to go dry. Its first one-room school building opened in 1877 and was replaced by a two-story building in 1884. In 1884, Howe was incorporated, with George M. McCrary as mayor. By the late 1880s, the town had become a major grain-shipping center and was the home of red rust-proof oats. A number of seed companies had their beginnings there in that decade. Howe became home to a Farmers' Alliance Cooperative Association, which was absorbed by the Howe Grain and Mercantile Company in 1894. In 1890, Howe had a population of 450, a steam gristmill, a Farmers' Alliance Cooperative, and Baptist and Methodist churches, as well as a number of hotels, doctors, druggists, and barbers. Several newspapers were published in Howe, such as the Howe Herald from 1890 to the 1910s and the Howe Messenger in the late 1930s and early '40s. During the 1930s, the Howe Chronicle was published by former Governor James E. Ferguson and his brother A. M. Ferguson. The Howe Enterprise was established in 1963 by A.P. \\"Pop\\" Sloan. On May 15, 1896, an F5 category tornado passed through the west side of Howe and the Farmington community, sweeping away around 17 homes.Tornado outbreak sequence of May 1896#Sherman, Texas By 1914, the Texas Traction Company, better known as the Interurban, was providing service to Howe. This electric train ran between Denison and Dallas with a stop in Howe. By 1914, Howe also had the Farmers National Bank, the Howe Herald, three grain elevators, and an ice plant. The community's population had grown from 521 in 1904 to 680 in the early 1960s. After then, it rose rapidly through the early 1980s, reaching 2,173 by 1990. By 2000, the population was 2,478. Throughout most of its history, Howe remained primarily an agricultural center, but some oil has been produced in the area. During the early 1980s, Howe reported some 30 businesses. In 1981, local industries included a shirt manufacturer and a hydraulics company, and by 1991, the number of manufacturers in Howe had risen to five, including makers of plastics, electronics, and agricultural equipment. On April 26, 2016, an F1 category tornado struck Howe around 10:00 pm, injuring three people and damaging over 20 homes. It started in a field behind the Summit Hill housing division, where a home was destroyed off Smith Road, then it proceeded northeast and crossed US Hwy 75, where trucker Gene Marshall was filming it; the storm tossed his truck and semitrailer to the other side of the road along with three cars. It then hit the north side of the high school before going directly through Stark Lane.

Denison is east of Pottsboro via Farm Road 120, and Sherman, the county seat, is to the southeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, Pottsboro has a total area of , all of it land. History Judge James G. Thompson and Mr. James Archer Potts both owned large ranches at the future site of Pottsboro, before its inception. Pottsboro was established in 1876 by James A. Potts, a pioneer settler who donated land for a town and a right-of-way so that the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad would extend its tracks westward from Denison to his settlement. The community, no doubt aided by its status as a stop on the railroad, grew rapidly for the rest of the 1800s. It incorporated in 1880 with the name \\"Pottsborough\\", and by 1885 its population had reached 200 and it supported a cotton gin, several gristmills, and a number of churches. Pottsboro suffered devastating fires which destroyed a great deal of the business section of the town: 1890, 1902, 1923 and 1924. Father-in-law of J.A. Potts, Judge James G. Thompson, applied for a post office in 1891, when they responded, the \\"ugh\\" was dropped from the name by the federal government and the town's name finally became \\"Pottsboro.\\" A post office opened there in 1891. The population reached 454 in 1920 and 500 in 1925. By that time the community was served by some 25 businesses, including a bank, and by two schools with a combined enrollment of 300 students. Pottsboro declined to a population of 358 by 1936 and 312 by the mid-1940s. It then grew to 383 by 1957. The number of businesses had fallen to twelve by 1948, though by the late 1950s it was back up to more than twenty. The town began to grow again during the 1950s, perhaps spurred by the rapid expansion of nearby Denison. By 1967 Pottsboro reported thirty businesses and a population of 750, and by 1990 its population was 1,177. The population grew to 1,579 in 2000.

The city's population in 2010 was 38,521. It is one of the two principal cities in the Sherman‚ÄìDenison Metropolitan Statistical Area, and it is part of the Texoma region of North Texas and southern Oklahoma. History Sherman in 1891 Sherman was named after General Sidney Sherman (July 23, 1805 ‚Äì August 1, 1873), a hero of the Texas Revolution. The community was designated as the county seat by the act of the Texas legislature which created Grayson County on March 17, 1846. In 1847, a post office began operation. Sherman was originally located at the center of the county, but in 1848 it was moved about east to its current location. By 1850, Sherman had become an incorporated town under Texas law. It had also become a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail route through Texas. By 1852, Sherman had a population of 300 and consisted of a public square with a log court house, several businesses, a district clerk's office, and a church along the east side of the square. In 1861, the first flour mill was built. During the 1850s and 1860s, Sherman continued to develop and to participate in regional politics. Because many residents of North Texas had migrated from the Upper South and only a low percentage were slaveholders, there was considerable Unionist sentiment in the region. E. Junius Foster, the publisher of Sherman's anti-secessionist Whig newspaper, the Patriot, circulated a petition to establish North Texas as an independent free state. Following Confederate passage of a conscription law, there was resistance in North Texas to conscription, especially as owners of many slaves were exempt. A group of slaveholders in nearby Cooke County feared the Unionists might join together others and perform acts of sabotage. In October 1862, a unit of state militia arrested between 150 and 200 men on suspicion of insurrection. In the Great Hanging at Gainesville, 42 of the arrested men were killed, most of them hanged by a mob, while others were sentenced to death by a self-appointed \\"citizens' court\\". Following the lynchings, Colonel William Young, who had organized the jury for the \\"citizens' court,\\" was killed by unknown assailants. Young had been responsible for more than 20 deaths. Newspaper publisher Foster \\"applauded\\" Young's death, and was soon gunned down by Capt. Jim Young, the colonel's son. Pro-Confederate militiamen rounded up even more \\"suspects\\" in Sherman, but Confederate Brigadier General James W. Throckmorton intervened to stop the killings. By the time Throckmorton restored order, only five of the originally arrested men were still alive. Late in the Civil War, pro-Confederate guerrillas led by William Quantrill spent the winter in Sherman. Former guerrilla Jesse James also came to Sherman for his honeymoon. He was photographed seated on his horse in Sherman. During the 1860s, secondary education developed in north Texas. The Sherman Male and Female High School began accepting students in 1866, under the patronage of the North Texas Methodist Conference. It became one of three private schools opporating in Sherman. The male and female high school operated under several names, including: the North Texas Female College and Conservatory of Music from 1892 to 1919 and Kidd-Key College and Conservatory, from 1919 to 1935.Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. \\"Kidd-Key College\\", (accessed March 18, 2007) It gradually lost Methodist support, following the opening of Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1915. In 1876, Austin College, the oldest continuously operating college in Texas, was relocated to Sherman from Huntsville. The Sherman Female Institute, later called Mary Nash College,Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. \\"Mary Nash College\\", (accessed March 18, 2007) opened in 1877 under sponsorship of the Baptist Church. It continued to operate until 1901, when the campus was sold to Kidd-Key College. Carr‚ÄìBurdette College, a women's college affiliated with the Disciples of Christ, operated from 1894 to 1929. Sherman also has a long history within the Jewish community. By 1873, Jews in the region regularly met for the High Holidays.\\"Sherman/Denison, Texas\\" , found in the Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities, While there was general depression and lawlessness during the Reconstruction, Sherman remained commercially active. During the 1870s Sherman's population reached 6,000. In 1875, after two fires destroyed many buildings east of the town square, a number of civic buildings were rebuilt using more permanent materials. This included a new Grayson County Courthouse built in 1876. In 1879, the Old Settlers' Association of North Texas formed and met near Sherman. The organization incorporated in 1898 and purchased Old Settlers' Park in 1909. On May 15, 1896, a tornado measuring F5 on the Fujita scale struck Sherman. The tornado had a damage path wide and long, killing 73 people and injuring 200. About 50 homes were destroyed, with 20 of them completely obliterated. In 1901 the first electric \\"Interurban\\" railway in Texas, the Denison and Sherman Railway, was completed between Sherman and Denison.Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. \\"Electric Interurban Railways\\" (accessed March 31, 2007) The Texas Traction Company completed a interurban between Sherman and Dallas in 1908, and in 1911 purchased the Denison and Sherman Railway. Through the connections in Dallas and Denison, it was possible to travel to the Texas destinations of Terrell, Corsicana, Waco, Fort Worth, Cleburne, and Denton, as well as to Durant, Oklahoma, by interurban railways. One popular destination on the Interurban between Sherman and Denison was Wood Lake Park, a private amusement park at the time. By 1948, all interurban rail service in Texas had been discontinued.

History  Thomas Bean, a wealthy Bonham landowner and surveyor, donated of land in southeast Grayson County to be used for a branch railroad line from Sherman to Commerce. Bean died in 1887; in that year the city of Tom Bean was established. Nearby Whitemound, which was bypassed by the railroad, lost its post office to Tom Bean's city in 1888; many Whitemound settlers moved to the new town. Mr. Bean's estate began to sell town lots surrounding the railroad in the 1890s. The city school was moved in 1891 from a one-room structure to a two-story building with an auditorium. Several Christian denominations, including the Church of Christ, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist, established churches in town. The city charter was signed in 1897, and the first mayor was Ice B. Reeves. In the early days of the 20th century, the city boomed. Within a few years, it boasted a grain company, a furniture company, a drugstore, a newspaper called the Tom Bean Bulletin, a saloon, a dance hall, a movie theater, and the Tom Bean social club. As time progressed, the sharp increase in automobile travel and transport, and the decline of cotton as the principal crop of the area, led businesses to the larger cities of Denison and Sherman. Though never again the railroad boomtown of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the community enjoyed a growth spurt in the 1950s and 1980s, celebrating its centennial in 1987.http://www.tombean.net/history.php Current growth is due to its proximity to nearby Sherman, to the northwest.

Education Public education in the city of Anderson is provided by the Anderson-Shiro Consolidated Independent School District. History Long occupied by indigenous peoples, this area was initially settled by Europeans and creole Spanish during Spanish colonial rule. Anglo-Americans began to enter the area in the 1820s from the South of the United States. After Mexico achieved independence, it accepted additional settlers from the United States into eastern Texas. It allowed them to practice their own religion, if they swore loyalty to Mexico. A few structures in town date from this period. Texas achieved independence in 1836 and settlers continued to arrive from the United States. As they came mostly from the South and brought slaves with them, Grimes and other eastern counties had the highest proportion of slaveholders and slaves in the republic. Grimes County was organized in 1846, soon after the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States. Henry Fanthorp, a new Anglo-American settler in Texas, offered land for the county seat. The town grew quickly between 1846 and 1885, reaching a peak population of about 3,000 people. County population was majority-black and enslaved by 1860. The black majority continued until many African Americans left during the 20th century in the Great Migration, to leave behind Jim Crow conditions. Anderson in 1859 rejected being connected to the Texas and Central Railroad, and was soon surpassed in population and economic growth by Navasota, Texas. Anderson could not catch up again, although it accepted a railroad in 1903. The town was incorporated, but records show elected officials only for the years 1867 and 1875. In 1983 a movement to revive city government was defeated at the polls. In 1995, the town began having major sewer problems and the state threatened to shut down the county courthouse if the problems were not fixed. One solution was to incorporate the town again so that it would be eligible for grants to acquire a sewer system. In 1995, John Freeman was elected as the first major, and the town was incorporated in 1998. He retired in 2003 and Gail Sowell was elected as mayor. Anderson Historic District The entire town and surrounding areas has been recognized as the Anderson Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1974. The area was originally settled during Spanish colonial rule. The town is unusual in that a large number of structures have survived that reflect the history of Texas from the Mexican period through the years of the Republic of Texas and into early statehood. Anderson has never fully recovered from economic decline suffered during the late nineteenth century. As a result, the town's appearance has been largely unchanged since the beginning of the twentieth century. Notable buildings within the district, either due to being specifically named as more important structures that typify Anderson on the district's NRHP nomination form or to their inclusion on the state's heritage registries, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), include the following: *Allen Home (RTHL #14266, 1965), 440 Fanthorp St. ‚Äî This Greek Revival house was built around 1840 and first served as a girls' academy, the Miss Sally Thompson School Building (RTHL #8622, 1965).

Main St. ‚Äî The Greek Revival church was built between 1853 and 1855 from native stone by enslaved African-American laborers and artisans. The church features three entrance doors with a larger, taller central doorway and evokes the style of rural Greek Revival churches in New England. The Baptist General Convention of Texas was organized here in 1848. After a 1955 fire, the church was reconstructed using the original stone but with a replacement bell tower. *Rueben Bennett House (RTHL #14195, 1963) *H.H. Boggess House, 201 Fanthorp St. ‚Äî This residence is one of three homes of porticoed, Palladian architecture in close proximity on Fanthorp Street, forming an unusual cluster. This house features a double gallery. *Fanthorp Inn State Historic Site (SAL #8200000297, 1983), 579 S. Main St. ‚Äî Henry Fanthorp, who would be appointed in 1835 as postmaster of the provisional government of the Texas Republic, originally constructed this structure in 1834. It was a clapboard-covered cedar log house in a dogtrot-style, with random-width puncheon floors. He built it as the family home for his third wife, Rachel Kennard. They began to use the building as a hotel and mercantile structure, and it held the region's first post office. The inn grew incrementally until 1851, when a second floor and residence wing were added, bringing capacity to thirty rooms. In 1845, Vice President Kenneth Lewis Anderson of the Republic of Texas, after whom the town is named, died while staying at the inn. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department acquired the property in 1977 and, following extensive restoration, opened the site to the public in 1987 as a demonstration of life at a stagecoach stop and family home in 1850. *B.B. Goodrich House (RTHL #8582, 1963), 335 Fanthorp St. ‚Äî Benjamin Briggs Goodrich was an American medical doctor who settled in Texas in the early 1800s. He later served as a member of the Convention of 1836 and signed the Texas Declaration of Independence adopted by the convention; he also signed the new republic's constitution. The small Palladian house has a two- story, double porticoed central section, with one-story wings on each side. *Grimes County Courthouse (SAL #8200000298, 1992; RTHL #8585, 1965), 100 S. Main St. ‚Äî This 1891 structure is the third courthouse on a site donated by Henry Fanthorp. The Edwardian-Victorian structure is composed of hand-made red brick walls and rusticated native stone groins and entrances. Atop the building is a central wooden cupola, and the courthouse contains the same vault as its predecessors. *Steinhagen Log Cabin (RTHL #8617, 1965), 201 Houston St. ‚Äî This pre-1860 cabin is made up of unspliced timbers, stones, doors, and window shutters, all crafted by enslaved African-American workers. *Vernacular Palladian House, 241 Fanthorp St. ‚Äî This is another small porticoed Palladian house of Texas vernacular style.

Geography Navasota is located in southwestern Grimes County, east of the Navasota River, a tributary of the Brazos River. It is northwest of Houston. Navasota is located in Grimes County, Texas. Texas State Highway 105 is the main east‚Äìwest route that passes through the center of Navasota, leading southwest to Brenham and east to Conroe. Texas State Highway 6 passes north‚Äìsouth through the eastern side of the city as a four-lane bypass, leading northwest to College Station and south to Hempstead. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.47%, are water. History French explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, misguided in his attempt to locate the Mississippi River and a way back to French-held lands near the Great Lakes, came through the area which would become Navasota in 1687. It was there that La Salle was murdered by one of his men. After numerous voyages, explorations of the Mississippi valley, trading ventures and several mutinies, La Salle's bones are believed to have found their resting place in the Navasota Valley. Navasota was founded by European Americans in 1831 as a stagecoach stop named \\"Nolansville\\". Its name was changed in 1858 to Navasota, a name perhaps derived from the Native American word nabatoto (\\"muddy water\\"). After September 1859, when the Houston and Texas Central Railway built into the town, Navasota became important as a shipping and marketing center for the surrounding area. When nearby Washington-on-the-Brazos resisted the coming of the rails, the old historic town forfeited its geographic advantage. It began to decline after many of its businesses and residents began to migrate to the new railhead to the northeast across the Brazos River at Navasota. Slavery was integral to the local economy. Planters depended on enslaved African Americans as the workers on their large cotton plantations. The slaves were brought to the city and sold in the domestic slave trade. They worked primarily in the cotton fields, which represented a major commodity crop in the area. Guns were made in nearby Anderson. Cotton, gunpowder, and shoes were made, processed and stored there for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. By 1865 the population was about 2,700. Throughout the Civil War, all the marketable goods produced in the region were brought to Navasota, which at the time was the furthest inland railhead in Texas. Such goods were shipped south by rail to Galveston, where they could be transported by steamboat along the Texas coast and up the Mississippi River to the war effort, or exported to Mexico or overseas to Europe. Navasota suffered a series of disasters in the mid-1860s that severely depleted its population. In 1865 a warehouse filled with cotton and gunpowder exploded after it was torched by returning Confederate soldiers. The blast killed a number of people and started a fire that destroyed much of the original downtown. Many buildings were damaged, including the post office. Not long afterward, the town was struck by a deadly cholera epidemic. That was followed in 1867 by an even more dangerous epidemic of yellow fever. Many Navasota citizens, including the mayor, fled to escape the disease, and the town's population dropped by about 50 percent. In the late 1860s the KKK spread into Navasota. On one occasion a tense confrontation between federal soldiers and a crowd of local whites occurred there. Navasota was considered such a \\"wild and woolly\\" place, that women and children were discouraged from going downtown even in broad daylight. The downtown buildings were overrun with lawless ruffians, gamblers, prostitutes, and drunks. Lawmen had to hide and watch, and often were afraid of the streets at night. There were many saloons and gaming halls to entertain the cowboys, railroad men, and others on the loose. Every Sunday morning the undertaker hitched up the buggy and went downtown to collect the bodies he expected to find, after another wild Saturday night. Perhaps the greatest and most publicized violence was around the turn of the century, during the decline of the Populist Party in Grimes County, and the re-election efforts of Populist candidate Garrett Scott for County Sheriff. A man who spent his entire life in Grimes County, Scott had great charm and political skill. He also worked extremely well with the black population. Since before the Civil War, the population of the county had been majority black because of planters' dependence on slavery. Few freedmen had relocated after emancipation. But in 1900, the White Man's Union (WMU) began to attack blacks with mobs from Grimes and surrounding counties. Despite resentment by much of the white population, Scott had been reelected several times, and served as sheriff for the better part of two decades. During this time a number of black Republican candidates also succeeded in their election efforts. An all-white mob flooded into Anderson on November 7, 1900, where they killed Emmett Lee Scott, John I. Bradley, and many unnamed black residents of the county. A gunman in the courthouse cupola shot Sheriff Scott as he crossed the street in front of the jail. His niece, Nealy Tuck, came out of the jail and threw herself over him to protect him from the rage of bullets that rained down from unseen assailants in the courthouse. The only WMU participant to die was William McDonald, the son of Judge McDonald. The assassination attempt failed initially as Scott was dragged to the jail and survived. He and a large portion of his extended family were pinned down in the jail for many days by constant gunfire. Scott's aunt Elizabeth Rowan Scott Neblett implored the governor to intervene. So did Scott's father, John Newton Scott, and his two surviving brothers, postmaster James D. Scott, and Navasota lawman John H. Scott. They sent urgent telegrams to the governor explaining how many men and women were \\"pinned down\\" in the Anderson Jail with no hope of leaving alive without State Militia assistance. Scott was badly wounded and would later die of the complications that developed while he and his family were trapped in the jail. After the militia arrived, wounded men, including husbands and sons were loaded into their wagons and carried into Navasota and to Houston by train. Their women protected them on the way, and the WMU gunmen refrained from killing the Scott women. Scott survived long enough to divest his land in the county and to bring a successful lawsuit against every merchant in the county (this was the only way to oppose the secret membership of the WMU; after Nov 7, 1900, a white man trying to do business in the county had to belong to the WMU). No murder or assault charges were filed because it was learned that McDonald had shot Emmett Scott point blank in the face as Scott entered Bradley's establishment. Bradley (Emmett Lee Scott's best friend) shot McDonald in retaliation and was shot in return fire. The only non-WMU witness to this gunbattle was a severely traumatized teenage Scott girl. All of the other would-be assailants and assassins hid in the courthouse and other buildings, not showing their identities. Following this battle, blacks migrated from Grimes County to north Texas and beyond into Oklahoma; so many left that the following season the planters nearly lost their cotton crop for lack of workers. The county sponsored newspaper ads in the Dallas area, beseeching former black residents to return to their \\"Homes\\" in Grimes County. In 1908, Navasota was still a Wild West boomtown: \\"shootouts on the main street were so frequent that in two years at least a hundred men died.\\" Famed lawman, Frank Hamer, then 24 years old, was hired away from the Texas Rangers to become the City Marshal. He moved in, and imposed law and order. Hamer faced down, chased down, and beat down the Navasota toughs until the streets were quiet and children could once again go downtown. He served as marshal until 1911. Hamer became more widely known in 1934 as a leader of the posse that hunted and fatally shot Bonnie and Clyde. In 2012, the City of Navasota commissioned local sculptor Russell Cushman to design and create a statue of Frank Hamer that is now on display in front of the city hall building. Present As of 2018, the population was estimated at 7,715. The industrial sector of the community now boasts 23 companies and over 1,200 jobs. In 2009, Navasota was selected as a \\"Visionaries in Preservation\\" city by the Texas Historical Commission to protect the numerous historic structures in the city. A new municipal building was completed in 2011, and continued downtown improvements are under construction, with completion scheduled in 2023. In 2012, Navasota Municipal Airport completed an expansion of its runway to long by wide, now accommodating jets on the runway. The city of Navasota earned a 2011 Gold Leadership Award from the Texas Comptroller's Office for efforts in transparency. Its application scored 17 of 20 points. Navasota was one of 70 (out of over a thousand) cities in Texas to receive the Gold status. It also received the award in 2013. In 2012, Navasota was named by the Union Pacific Railroad as a \\"Train Town USA.\\" In August 2013, Navasota was named a Go Texan \\"Certified Retirement Community\\" by the Texas Department of Agriculture. Media Navasota is served by the weekly Navasota Examiner newspaper, which has been reporting on the goings-on in Grimes County since 1894. The city is also home to the Willy 98.7 FM and 1550 AM, owned and managed by Bryan Broadcasting in Bryan, Texas. Willy 98.7 is a classic country format, with local programming that includes Navasota News and live broadcasts of the Navasota Rattlers football games. In 2013, the British documentary project known as Vague Direction visited Navasota and featured local residents Misslette The Singing Cowgirl and Steve Stribling, a local hog trapper. Attractions The Sangster House (established 1902) Navasota has many shops and artisans in its historic downtown district, typified by antique, gift, and boutique stores and art galleries housed in old classic stone and brick structures. Live plays are performed regularly at the Sunny Furman Theatre. The city also has golfing facilities and parks, as well as wineries. Navasota retains a number of historic Victorian homes on Washington Avenue, the main residential and commercial thoroughfare through town. Another attraction is the historic Brule Field, a natural amphitheater built out of native stone by the Great Depression-era Works Progress Administration. It served as the primary grid for the local high school football team, the Navasota Rattlers, until the new stadium was constructed in 2006. Several native-stone churches also remain near downtown, with distinctive Victorian fronts. The city is home to two statues of French explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, including a bronze monument, dedicated in 1936 by the DAR, to celebrate the travels of the famous French explorer. The second is a stone bust that was previously in downtown, and was rededicated by the French consulate in May 2012 at nearby August Horst Park. The bust was donated to the city by the French government in 1978. Each spring, Navasota is a popular destination for its bluebonnet fields, the state flower of Texas. A statue of Mance Lipscomb is now a part of Mance Lipscomb Park, near downtown. A statue of Frank Hamer stands in front of city hall, honoring the time he served as city marshal. Local artist and sculptor Russell Cushman designed and built the bronze statue. Other attractions include art galleries, the Horlock House Artists-in- Residence program and museum, live music venues, food truck parks and several murals that present great selfie locations for area visitors. Seasonal festivals attract crowds each year, with live music being a large part of the draw.

History In 1831 during the Mexican Texas period, James Bowie surveyed eleven leagues of land within the colony of Green DeWitt. Located on the northeast bank of the Guadalupe River, the area surrounded the natural springs called \\"Tio Geronimo\\". Jos√© Antonio Navarro purchased land and lived here later, 1840-1853.Texas Portal As a champion of human rights, he was a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, and the Constitution of the State of Texas. Navarro lived here on his San Geronimo Ranch. It was located on Geronimo Creek and named for Saint Jerome (translator of the Bible into Latin). The town and creek are named to honor this saint, although othersBading, 2007 claim that the name comes from original owner of the springs, \\"Tio\\" (Uncle) Geronimo Flores. Jos√© Antonio Navarro's brother, Luciano Navarro, also ran a ranch in the area. The area is about north of Seguin, the Guadalupe County seat. In the mid-1800s, Geronimo became popular as a social center for German settlers. German settlers from Schumansville moved into the area in 1860 and formed a community. One enterprising settler opened a bank and German civic center. The community had grown into a small town by 1891, sporting a general store, a post office (former bank), a steam-powered cotton gin, and a population of twenty. A one-teacher school brought education to forty students in 1904. By 1917, the post office had relocated, sharing occupancy with a local feed store. In 1919, a park, complete with a spring-fed swimming pool, was constructed beside Geronimo Creek.

When the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio railroad was built through the area in 1876, the stop was named \\"Hilda\\". In 1900, a local businessman, C. F. Blumberg, built a general store east of the rail stop. Hoping to get the railroad to move the stop from Hilda to his store, Blumberg called the site \\"McQueeney\\", in honor of the local railroad superintendent. The railroad was not persuaded, but the post office that opened in 1900 was called McQueeney. Lake McQueeney was created in 1925 by damming the Guadalupe River.

Seguin ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Guadalupe County, Texas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 25,175. By 2019, the population was estimated to be 29,992. Seguin, named in honor of Juan Segu√≠n, a Tejano Texian freedom fighter and early supporter of the Republic of Texas, is one of the oldest towns in Texas, founded just 16 months after the Texas Revolution began. The frontier settlement was a cradle of the Texas Rangers and home to the celebrated Captain Jack Hays, perhaps the most famous Ranger of all. Seguin was the home of Dr. John E. Park, who experimented in construction using concrete made from local materials. The nearly 100 structures‚Äîthe courthouse, schools, churches, homes, cisterns, walls, etc.‚Äîmade up the largest concentration of early 19th-century concrete buildings in the United States. About 20 of them remain standing. The use of concrete largely ended when the railroad arrived in 1876, bringing cheap lumber and the equipment needed for brick-making. The town had five brickworks, and the wooden buildings of downtown were completely replaced with brick by the beginning of World War I. For almost 100 years, the town was dependent on the rich surrounding farmland and ranches. Then the Texas oil boom came just as the Great Depression was taking down other towns and cities. Seguin could raise enough tax money to match the federal grants for \\"make- work\\" projects. The New Deal transformed the city's public face with Art Deco- style city hall, courthouse, jail, and fountain, as well as storm sewers, sidewalks, and three swimming pools (one for Anglos, one for Blacks, one for Hispanics). The town commemorated its centennial by opening Max Starcke Park, with a golf course, a pavilion, picnic tables, and BBQ pits along a scenic river drive, and a curving dam that created a waterfall. To preserve some of the historic character of the town, Seguin became one of the state's first Main Street cities, and the downtown district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fine homes by leading architects J. Reily Gordon, Solon McAdoo, Leo M.J. Dielman, Atlee B. Ayers, and Marvin Eickenroht dating from the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be found on many streets. However, the city does not have any officially designated historic residential districts. The postwar era had industrial development, including a minimill that turned scrap metal into construction products. A plant was built by Motorola in 1972 to produce car electronics. It was bought by Continental AG in 2006. A Caterpillar diesel engine assembly plant was opened in 2008. Weather and climate On the northern edge of the South Texas Plains, Seguin enjoys a mild winter. The sunny days of spring bring on spectacular shows of wildflowers from March into June. Most of Texas suffers very hot, humid summers from June into September. Then cold fronts pushing down from the north usually trigger precipitation and make October a rainy month, bringing \\"a second spring\\" of wildflowers. At their worst, fall and winter have \\"northers\\", fast-moving cold fronts with wind, often rain, and rapid drops of temperature, frequently falling 30 ¬∞F (17 ¬∞C) or more during one day. Northers give way to warm spells, right through the winter. Attractions * ZDT's Amusement Park, a family-owned, family-oriented amusement park, it features over a dozen attractions. Repurposed century-old agribusiness structures provide Texas' highest indoor playground with tunnels and slides, wall climbing up former silos, and riding go-karts through, and on the roof of, an old warehouse, as well as modern parachute drop and a water ride.

Many events are held on weekends, and tours are given by appointment. * Sebastopol House Historic Site is perhaps the finest surviving 19th-century concrete building west of the Mississippi. Here on the frontier, settlers began experimenting with concrete construction years before the Civil War, and built 100 or so structures of \\"lime-crete\\", as it was called. A team of slaves built this mansion, mixing local gravel, sand, lime, and some organic materials, then pouring the mix into wooden forms. When the concrete was solid, they raised the forms and repeated the process. A journalist declared Seguin \\"the Mother of Concrete Cities\\". Sebastopol House, a well-preserved architectural masterpiece, built in 1856 in Greek Revival style, is now a museum offering free tours. * Heritage Museum ‚Äì Artifacts from Paleo-Indian archeological sites, a display on the Wilson Pottery (the first business in Texas successfully operated by ex-slaves after the Civil War), and keep chests of other historical collections illustrate the area's rich multiethnic heritage; it is located downtown. * Heritage Village ‚Äì * The oldest still-surviving Protestant church in Texas, built in 1849 for a Methodist Conference, outlived the state's older churches lost to storms, fires, and progress (torn down to make way for newer, larger ones). *A log cabin built by an Irish immigrant, who promptly returned to Ireland to rescue his family from the Great Potato Famine.

History=Prehistory The Seguin area was once inhabited by the native hunter-gatherer Indians of Texas. An ongoing archeological dig indicates campgrounds dating back 10,000 years or so, with trade items from Mexico and Arizona. The early visitors may have come to gather pecans, because the native trees bearing the tasty nut thrive in the river bottoms of the Guadalupe. By the time the first European explorers passed through, predominantly Tonkawas lived in the area, camping around the Guadalupe and other streams in the area. Eventually, Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo settlers started farms and ranches in the location that would become Seguin. Early history Jos√© Antonio Navarro, one of the earliest settlers and an important figure of Texas history, developed a ranch near Seguin., Texas Settlement In 1831, land was granted to Umphries Branch by the Mexican government. The Branch and John Newton Sowell Sr. families settled in 1833 in the western part of Green DeWitt's colony.\\"Seguin, Texas\\", Handbook of Texas Online Sowell was a farmer, and in 1833 he and his brothers became the first Anglo-American immigrants to raise corn in future Guadalupe County.\\"Sowell Family\\", Texas A&M; University Between 1827 and 1835, 22 families came to the area as part of the DeWitt Colony; by 1833, 40 land titles were in the region, 14 of which received grants directly from the Mexican government.Vivian Elizabeth Smyrl, \\"GUADALUPE COUNTY,\\" Handbook of Texas Online . Retrieved April 29, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In 1836, John Gladden King lived near Seguin. His farm neighbored the Sowells on the northwest and Branch on the southeast. A son, William Philip King, reportedly was part of a cannon crew and was the youngest defender killed during the Battle of the Alamo.Russell S. Hall, \\"KING, JOHN GLADDEN\\", Handbook of Texas Online . Retrieved May 14, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. These homesteads were abandoned in the Runaway Scrape. Old Seguin The town of Seguin was founded August 12, 1838, 16 months after Texas won its independence at the Battle of San Jacinto, making it one of the oldest towns in Texas. Members of Mathew Caldwell's Gonzales Rangers acquired land originally granted to Umphries Branch, who had departed during the Runaway Scrape and sold his land to Joseph S. Martin. At this time, the Seguin area was a part of Gonzales County, the remaining portion known as present-day Belmont. The Rangers had found this was a good halfway stop between their patrol points. The big oaks and walnut groves along the Walnut Branch, had become a familiar and pleasant location. It had been maintained as a base camp by the rangers since the early founding of the Dewitt Colony. 19th century history Under an ancient live oak, 33 Rangers signed the charter for the town. Many were surveyors who joined Joseph Martin in laying out the lots for the town. Its original name was Walnut Springs, but was changed just 6 months later to honor San Jacinto veteran and then a Senator of the Republic of Texas, Juan Segu√≠n. The surveyors' plan for the city included a main north‚Äìsouth street that ran straight and flat for a mile and more. The streets form a grid, around a central square of two blocks, today's Courthouse Square and Central Park, formerly known as Market Square. Manuel Flores, veteran of San Jacinto and brother-in-law of Juan Seguin, established a ranch just south of Seguin in 1838. It became a safe-haven for San Antonio families and a staging point for counterattack when Bexar was overrun in 1842 by Santa Anna's forces under R√°fael V√°squez and Adrian Woll. Leading the resistance forces from this location was Texas Ranger John Coffee \\"Jack\\" Hays. When duty allowed, Hays was a familiar resident of Seguin. In 1843, Hays set up a gathering point at the \\"Walnut Branch Ranger Station in Seguin, where the classic Ranger character was born. He met Susan Calvert, whose father owned the Magnolia Hotel, where they married in April 1847. Serving under Hays were two other famous Ranger residents of Seguin: Henry and Ben McCulloch. Their home known as \\"Hardscramble\\" still stands and was designated a Texas State Centennial historic site in 1936. Colonel James Clinton Neill, commander of the Alamo, was known to be buried here. The site was also historically marked during the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition. Seguin was named the county seat, and Guadalupe County was organized, early in 1845, as Texas became a state. The first county judge was Michael H. Erskine. The town was incorporated in 1853, and a city government was organized under acting Mayor John R. King, until elections were held later that year and John D. Anderson became the first elected mayor. A few years later, another town was laid out on the west side of Seguin, on land that had been titled by the Alamo defender Thomas R. Miller, and sold in 1840 to Ranger James Campbell in partnership with Arthur Swift and Andrew Neill. This area became part of Seguin within a few years, but 150 years later, the east‚Äìwest streets still do not match up to cross through the old Guadalupe Street border. When Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels and his German colonists were making their way in 1845 to the land they had bought to settle, Calvin Turner and Asa Sowell from Seguin were hired to guide them. Later, Seguin became a stopping point and trade center for German immigrants along their route from the ports of Indianola and Galveston to the German settlements around New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.Wolff, Linda. Indianola and Matagorda Island 1837‚Äì1887. Eakin Press, Austin, Texas, 1999. Many Germans en route heard of the hard times in those Hill Country settlements and decided instead to buy land and settle around Seguin. After Texas became a state, many settlers arrived from the Old South, bringing in hundreds of slaves in total, though only a few plantation owners held more than a dozen slaves. Most of the slaves lived on small farms with their owners, who remained subsistence farmers for years after settling their land. The contributions of African Americans to building the community are all but ignored in local histories written during the period when slavery was still being excused as justifiable due to the alleged low development of those enslaved. In fact, for the first 50 years or so, and probably for the first 100 years of the town, blacks did most of the construction work, including the main concrete buildings such as Sebastopol. Education was important to the town. By 1849, it chartered a school. The first schoolhouse was built in 1850; it burned and was soon replaced by a two-story limecrete building. This Guadalupe High School, now a part of the St James parochial school, was recognized by a historical marker in 1962 as the oldest continuously used school building in Texas. Seguin was home to Dr. John E. Park's concrete (limecrete). Called \\"the Mother of Concrete Cities\\" in the 1870s, the town once had nearly 100 structures made of limecrete, including the courthouse, schools, churches, houses, cisterns, and many walls. So many limecrete walls and corrals were built that Seguin gave the effect of being a walled city. This was the largest and most significant concentration of 19th-century concrete buildings in the U.S. About 20 of these vintage buildings survive today. In 1857, Frederick Law Olmsted, later famous as the landscape architect of New York's Central Park, toured Texas, writing dispatches to the New York Times. Olmsted exclaimed at the concrete structures he found here, almost on the edge of the frontier, and described the city as \\"the prettiest town in Texas.\\" One surviving concrete home, the Sebastopol House; built in 1856, is a Texas Historical Commission landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places due to its unusual limecrete construction and architectural style. Stagecoaches began to serve the town in 1848, connecting coastal ports to San Antonio and points west. The Magnolia Hotel was an overnight stop for the exhausted, hungry, and dirt-covered riders. A young slave had the honor of standing on a stone to pull the bell rope alerting the community to the arrival of the stage, which brought visitors, the mail, newspapers, and special merchandise. Heading west from the Magnolia, the stage route went through town, passing the courthouse. Today, a mural commemorates its path. During the Great Depression, workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps traced part of the route with stone walls, showing how it moved downhill, crossed Walnut Branch (a spring-fed tributary of the Guadalupe River), and climbed the other side. The historic Wilson Pottery site is on Capote Road, near Seguin. The pottery was the first successful business in Texas owned and operated by freed slaves, beginning in 1869. During Reconstruction, the freed slaves in Seguin organized their own congregation, the Second Baptist Church, and in 1876, a school that came to be known as the Lincoln School. In 1887, they established Guadalupe College, comparable to a junior college today, with a heavy concentration on vocational education. These institutions were begun with the help of Rev. Leonard Ilsley, an abolitionist minister from Maine, but William Baton Ball, himself an ex-slave, Union soldier in the Civil War, and former Buffalo Soldier, became their leader. He was greatly assisted by his friend and benefactor George Brackenridge of San Antonio. (The main buildings of Guadalupe College burned due to a boiler malfunction during a bitterly cold night in 1936, and the college ended.) The railroad reached Seguin in 1876 en route to San Antonio, when the oldest railway in Texas, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad, chartered on February 11, 1850, as the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway Company built the first Seguin depot. It became part of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and now the main southern line of the Union Pacific. John Ireland was mayor of Seguin in 1858. Elected the 18th Governor of Texas 1883‚Äì1887, he had an important part in the construction of the Texas State Capitol‚Äîinsisting on using native stone, red granite from the Hill Country, instead of limestone imported from Indiana. He also presided over the opening of the University of Texas at Austin. 20th century history From before the Civil War until at least World War II, cotton was the money crop of the local farms, and the county had at least a dozen gins, with three in the town of Seguin, but agriculture was more diversified than in many counties where cotton was king, with corn, peanuts, hogs, and cattle, as well as wheat, oats, sugarcane, and most notably, pecans. The tiny but tasty native nuts were an early export. The crops improved as the bottomlands were converted to orchards, and eventually bigger varieties of nuts were grafted onto the local trees. This was one of the first counties to have a pecan growers' association, and in 1921, its leader, P.K. DeLaney, helped start the Texas Pecan Growers Association. The county remains one of the state's leading producers. Seguin has been called 'a big orchard with a small town in it' because almost every house is shaded by a pecan tree in the yard. A tribute to the nut's importance is \\"the World's Largest Pecan\\" erected on the courthouse lawn. Small mills were put on the Guadalupe River even before the Civil War. William Saffold established a mill at what is today Max Starcke Park. Later, Henry Troell made major improvements there, and in 1894, used hydroelectric power to light the town. The City of Seguin took over the dam and electric plant in 1907. The supply of cheap and reliable electricity helped to make possible several gins, mills, silos, an ice plant and ice cream maker, a cold meat storage facility, and other types of agribusiness. In 1912, citizens of Seguin lured a struggling church school to the city with cash, and 15 acres of land donated by Louis Fritz. It grew to a junior college and then into a four-year college to become today's Texas Lutheran University, with some 1,400 students and boasting high rankings on the U.S. News & World Report comparisons of universities. During the 1920s, the county began to enjoy a foretaste of an oil boom. While the first fields were at the far edge of the county, near Luling, the paperwork of deeds and leases (as well as any resulting lawsuits) passed through the Guadalupe County Courthouse. Then in December 1929, the Darst Creek Field was opened, only 15 miles east of Seguin. (The creek had been named for colonist and landowner Jacob C. Darst. He was one of the original \\"Old Eighteen\\", defenders of the Gonzales cannon and then a member of the Gonzales Ranging Company relief force to the Alamo during the siege in 1836.) With the Darst Field, Seguin became a supply center, and residents were able to rent out rooms to oil field workers for cash even during the worst years of the depression of the 1930s. As a result, Seguin was able to collect taxes when other towns just had to give up. It used the money to match federal grants for what some derided as \\"make-work\\" projects. Under the leadership of the popular mayor, Max Starcke, Seguin was transformed, with a new post office, a new Art Deco City Hall, courthouse, jailhouse and fountain in Central Park, new storm sewers and sidewalks, and a small park along Walnut Branch, with rustic stone walls that protected the historic springs and traced the route of the stagecoach as it headed west through town. The little city had three swimming pools, one for whites, one for blacks at the segregated high school, and one for Spanish-speaking citizens at the Juan Seguin school. Max Starcke's biggest achievement was a large park along the Guadalupe River, designed by Robert H.H. Hugman, famous now as \\"the Father of the River Walk\\" in San Antonio. The park featured a handsome Art Deco recreation building designed by Hugman (now offices) with changing rooms for the swimming pool. The nine-hole course was designed by John Bredemus, a prolific course designer who has been called \\"the father of Texas golf\\". The park offered picnic tables and bar-be-que pits between a scenic river drive and the river. Most of all, at a disused mill, Hugman and the young men of the National Youth Administration put a curving dam. As the 1938 dedication marker tells, funds were raised in part by public subscription. Dozens of groups and individuals made contributions to build the park that the town named for its popular mayor, who was moving on to, and soon to head, the Lower Colorado River Authority in Austin. After World War II, entrepreneurs fresh out of the university used electric furnaces to melt scrap into reinforcing bars with a company then called Structural Metals.

The population was 107 at the 2010 census, down from 152 at the 2000 census. Geography Lakeview is located at (34.672880, -100.697637). It is situated along State Highway 256 in north-central Hall County, southwest of Memphis, the county seat, and by road southeast of Clarendon. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History Lakeview's beginnings are unique as it has occupied two different sites in Hall County. The first site was located near the geographic center of the county on a section of the Southern Pacific Railroad survey in May 1890. A post office and several businesses sprang up at the site. After a failed attempt to become the county seat, most of the homes were sold to farmers and the land reverted to the family of S.L. Lindley. The post office was eventually relocated to the homestead of David H. Davenport, who operated a general store in 1902. Three years later, Davenport purchased land north of his farm that had a supply of soft water, making it a suitable site to develop a community. On June 11, 1908, he moved his store and post office and platted the second Lakeview site at its present-day location. Prospects for a new railroad grew in 1910, when the Altus, Roswell, and El Paso Company constructed a roadbed through Lakeview, but prevailing conditions forced them to abandon the project. Despite this and two disastrous fires in 1918 and 1919, the community survived. Lakeview was incorporated in 1921. By the late 1920s, the town had several stores and a population exceeding 1,000. A third fire in 1930 destroyed the business district, and the impact of the Great Depression contributed to Lakeview's decline. A short-lived boom in the late 1940s occurred, but it wasn't enough to revive the town. The First State Bank of Lakeview, in operation since 1908, merged with the First National Bank of Memphis in 1953. By 1980, the population had fallen to 244. That figure declined to 202 in 1990 and 152 in 2000. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 152 people, 51 households, and 36 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,290. History Memphis, Texas, the county seat of Hall County, is at the junction of U.S. Highway 287, State Highway 256, and Farm Road 1547, in the northeastern part of the county. It started in 1889, when J. C. Montgomery purchased land for a townsite north of Salisbury on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway. This land had been previously owned by W. H. Robertson, who had a dugout near Parker Creek. Montgomery and Robertson, with Rev. J. W. Brice and T. J. Woods, Jr., of Dallas, formed a townsite company and presented a plat early in January 1890. P. M. Kelly opened a law office. A rooming house (later the Memphis Hotel), a general store, a drugstore, and several residences were soon erected. For a time, the new town was without a name. Several suggestions were submitted to federal postal authorities, but with negative results. Finally, as the story goes, Reverend Brice, while in Austin, happened to see a letter addressed by accident to Memphis, Texas, rather than Tennessee, with the notation \\"no such town in Texas\\". The name was submitted and accepted, and a post office was established on September 12, 1890, with Robertson as postmaster. In the meantime, Hall County was being organized. Memphis was engaged in a heated county seat battle with neighboring Salisbury and Lakeview. Memphis won the election with a total of 84 votes. County officers were elected in June, and a school district was subsequently formed. Since Memphis was without a depot and trains did not stop there, certain citizens sought to remedy that situation by smearing the tracks with lye soap. A subsequent agreement was struck between town promoters and railroad officials. In 1891, a depot was built, and businesses were moved on wheels from Salisbury to the new county seat, where a courthouse of homemade bricks was constructed in 1892. Memphis thus enjoyed a boom period. Two saloons, a bank, numerous stores, blacksmith shops, and livery stables attested to its role as a shipping and trading center for area ranchers and farmers. The Missionary Baptist Church was organized in Memphis; its minister Rev. J. L. Pyle began Baptist congregations throughout the county. Telephone service was first installed in 1901. In June 1906, the town was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government. The Memphis Cotton Oil Mill was established in 1907. Memphis had at one time or another several newspapers, including the Hall County Record (1889‚Äì93), the Hall County Herald (1890‚Äì1928), the Memphis Journal (1892‚Äì94), the Memphis Times (1896), the Memphis Leader (1897‚Äì99), the Hall County News (1897‚Äì1903), and the Memphis News (1928‚Äì29). The only newspaper extant in 1986, the Memphis Democrat, was launched in 1908 and went through a succession of owners. By the 1920s, Memphis had a new brick-and-stone courthouse, modern utilities, a cotton compress, three hotels, brick school buildings, and a Carnegie Library. In 1922, the city's Morning Side addition was founded east of the tracks as a residential area for blacks who labored in the cotton fields and mills. In 1935, E. M. Ewen and his wife formed the Hall County Old Settlers' Reunion (later the Hall County Picnic Association). Four years later, they staged a rodeo as part of the annual two-day celebration. Since the Great Depression era, Memphis has continued as a farm supply center. In 1986, the city had a cotton compress, gins, a grain elevator, two banks, eight churches, four public schools, a modern medical complex, two motels, several mercantile stores (including three wholesale houses), and a municipal airport northeast of town. In addition, Memphis is noted for its tree-lined streets, city park, one swimming pool, community center, and 50 blocks of brick paving laid in 1926. Brookhollow Country Club Lake, a private fishing lake with cabin sites, is six miles northeast of the city. Heritage Hall, which occupies the old First National Bank building on the square, contains local history displays and natural science exhibits. The population was 3,332 in 1960 and 3,352 in 1980.

The population was 1,813 at the 2010 census. It was originally named \\"Sour Lake Springs\\", after the sulphurous spring water that flowed into the nearby lake. The city is part of the Beaumont-Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sour Lake is the oldest surviving town in Hardin County. It is called by some the \\"Gateway to the Big Thicket\\". History Sour Lake was first settled around 1835 when the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas granted Stephen Jackson one league of land covering by land grant. Sam Houston visited Sour Lake in his later years. The town is home to one of the biggest sinkholes in Texas. Sour Lake became a short-lived boomtown with the discovery of oil in 1901, shortly after oil was found at the nearby Spindletop salt dome. It is known as the birthplace of Texaco. Formed in 1903, the Texas Company (Texaco's former corporate name) is one of the three major oil companies that can trace its origins to the oil fields around Southeast Texas. The Sour Lake oilfield produced about of oil up to 1948, when it was producing about daily and new drilling was still underway. Today the Sour Lake oilfield is the oldest continuously-producing oil field in the world. In 1903, African Americans were driven out of town under threat of violence, and signs were posted declaring Sour Lake to be a sundown town. The town of Atcheson in Bruce McCandless's 2012 novel Sour Lake appears to be based at least loosely on the real Sour Lake. Atcheson, like the real-life Sour Lake, is situated in the Big Thicket and experienced a short-lived oil boom in early years of the 20th century.

Bellaire was founded in 1908 by William Wright Baldwin, who was the president of the South End Land Company. Baldwin, a native of Iowa, was well known as the vice president of the Burlington Railroad. Bellaire was founded on what was part of William Marsh Rice's ranch. Baldwin surveyed the eastern of the ranch into small truck farms. He named those farms \\"Westmoreland Farms\\". Baldwin started Bellaire in the middle of \\"Westmoreland Farms\\" to serve as a residential neighborhood and an agricultural trading center. South End Land Company advertised to farmers in the Midwestern United States. Baldwin stated that the town was named \\"Bellaire\\", or \\"Good Air\\" for its breezes\\". Bellaire may have been named after Bellaire, Ohio, a town served by one of Baldwin's rail lines. Six miles of prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally the town was bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910 Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could implement Sid Hare's landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as a city with a general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire's territory into its city limits, while annexing surrounding areas that were unincorporated.Lee, Ren√©e C. \\"Annexed Kingwood split on effects.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Bellaire's population had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population explosion in the post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent year for the next two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marian High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished to make way for the right of way of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city. According to a Bellaire resident quoted in the Houston Post, prior to 1992, the tax base of the city of Bellaire had been decreasing. After neighbor West University Place eased restrictions on developers, new houses were constructed in West University Place, and the city gained a larger tax base. Bellaire decided to also liberalize its development restrictions to allow for new development by streamlining its no-growth building permit process. According to Karl Lewis, a vice president and sales manager at John Daugherty Realtors, when the prices of West University Place land reached about $20 per square foot, area home buyers began to consider Bellaire, which had an average price of $10‚Äì12 per square foot.

A Bellaire lot can accommodate a house with a detached garage and a swimming pool, while the typical West University Place lot could accommodate a newly constructed Georgian house described by Don Stowers of the Houston Post as \\"lot-hugging.\\" The more spacious and inexpensive housing lots prompted area home seekers to consider Bellaire. The original Bellaire housing stock typically consisted of 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom post-World War II houses described by Stowers as \\"smallish.\\" Because of the attributes, developers did not hesitate to tear these houses down and build new houses. Some individuals chose to renovate their houses instead of having them torn down. Many individuals who would otherwise renovate the houses reconsidered their decisions as the land value increased. In some cases the land value was higher than the value of the structure on the lot. Some subdivisions had larger houses, particularly the Carroll subdivision south of Bellaire Boulevard and the Braeburn Country Club Estates subdivision between Chimney Rock and Rice. Many of the houses in those subdivisions were built in the 1950s and early 1960s, and many were on lots. Karl Lewis, the vice president and sales manager of John Daugherty Realtors, said that many of the houses were \\"still quite attractive\\" and \\"similar to the large Tanglewood homes.\\" In 1992 smaller lots in Bellaire were about $50,000 ($ in today's money) and up, while larger lots were $300,000 ($ in today's money) to $500,000 ($ in today's money).

In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus. On April 29, 1992, during an attendance boundary hearing committee for Southwest Houston, residents of a small portion of Bellaire zoned to Cunningham Elementary School, a school in Houston that was one block away from the city limits of Bellaire, advocated for a rezoning to Condit Elementary School, a facility in the City of Bellaire that was about away from that section. Condit was about 50% White and had a middle class student body while Cunningham was 95% Hispanic. On May 21, 1992, the HISD board voted to rezone that portion to Condit.McAdams, p. 55. Around the early 1990s portions of Bellaire west of the 610 Loop were zoned to Jane Long Middle School,McAdams, p. 57. while portions inside the 610 Loop were zoned to Pershing.McAdams, p. 58. \\"Bellaire residents who lived east of the 610 loop were zoned to Pershing Middle School\\" During that decade, the Bellaire Area School Improvement Committee, or BASIC, was formed to improve the reputation of HISD in Bellaire and to improve Bellaire area schools. The committee opened after HISD's failed attempt to acquire property in Bellaire for the West University relief school. An attempt to buy land at Bissonnet Street at Newcastle Drive in the City of Bellaire for a school to relieve West University Elementary School failed since City of Bellaire officials and parents living in Bellaire complained when they learned that they would not be zoned to the new school while losing what Tim Fleck of the Houston Press described as \\"a prime chunk of taxable property.\\"Fleck, Tim. \\"What Went Wrong at the Rice School?.\\" Houston Press. August 21, 1997. 3. Retrieved on September 8, 2009. After its formation, BASIC installed a gifted and talented magnet at Jane Long, a school which Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, described as a school that was \\"unacceptable\\" to Bellaire residents since it was less than 10% white. McAdams added that even with the new program, to many parents in Bellaire, Long was \\"never going to be acceptable\\" due to the overwhelming Hispanic presence. Therefore, there was a proposal to convert Gordon into a small middle school for Bellaire. The school would have space for about 500 students and would be at least 50% White, so it was popular among many Bellaire residents, particularly those outside of the 610 Loop. However those inside the 610 Loop did not want to lose access to Pershing, a full service middle school that was about 40% White. An attendance boundary committee for at HISD met from December 1992 to March 1993. McAdams wrote that the committee was \\"an all-out war\\" between the two sides. In February 1993 pro-Gordon persons argued that HISD should purchase a commercial building north of Long and renovate it into an elementary school which would relieve Gordon Elementary and other overcrowded are schools. McAdams wrote that the staff members of HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo \\"liked the idea, but unfortunately, on close examination the building proved to be inadequate.\\" In April 1993 the HISD board declared that the Gordon campus would continue to be an elementary school. McAdams wrote that the Gordon supporters and many Bellaire residents were \\"furious\\".

History  Channelview was given its name since it is located on the northeastern curve of the Houston Ship Channel. The site of Channelview was home to Lorenzo de Zavala, one of the founding fathers of the Republic of Texas. During World War II the area south of Market to the Ship Channel, and what is now DeZavala St. to the tollway, was part of the U.S. Army Ordnance Depot. Channelview was the site of a notable murder plot occurring in 1991. Wanda Webb Holloway was upset that her daughter, Shanna, had failed two consecutive years to make her junior high school's cheerleading squad. Holloway came to believe that the fault lay not with Shanna's inability to make the squad, but with Verna Heath, whose daughter, Amber Heath, was a main rival of Shanna's. Holloway asked Terry Harper, her former brother-in-law, to find a hit man to murder Verna Heath, hoping that Amber would be distraught and perform poorly in tryouts, thus allowing Shanna to make the squad. However, Harper notified authorities of the plot, and an undercover police officer arrested Holloway. Holloway argued that Harper was guilty of entrapment, saying that she never intended anyone to get killed. A jury sentenced Holloway to 15 years for attempted murder.Suro, Roberto. \\" Texas Mother Gets 15 Years In Murder Plot.\\" The New York Times. September 5, 1991.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Historical development The site north of U.S. Route 90 (according to some) was an encampment nicknamed Lick Skillet in 1823 by Humphrey Jackson, one of the 300 original colonists to settle Texas. The name \\"Lick Skillet\\" came from the phrase, \\"The East Texas oxen team drivers sipped the spring sweet water and licked their skillets clean.\\" Humphrey Jackson (1784‚Äì1833)JACKSON, HUMPHREY  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) moved to Texas from Louisiana in September 1823 and built a log cabin outside Austin's colony on the San Jacinto River, west of the site of present-day Crosby. On August 16, 1824, the Baron de Bastrop granted him title to a league and a labor of land, including the place where he had settled, in what is now Harris County. Jackson next petitioned the Mexican government to form the San Jacinto District under control of the Austin colony; he was elected alcalde of the new district in 1824, 1825, and 1827, and served as ex officio militia captain of the San Jacinto area. Jackson was buried at Crosby. Jackson's Bayou in eastern Harris County is probably named for him. Near what is now the Southern Pacific Railroad, the town was named for G.J. Crosby, a railroad construction engineer. In 1861, the Sabine and Galveston Bay Railroad and Lumber Company installed tracks through this site. The first general store was built in 1865 by Charlie Karcher, and thereafter the town would become a shipping and retail center for lumber and agricultural products. The post office was established in 1877. In 1884 Crosby reported a population of 50, a school, a Baptist church, and a general store. In 1905 it had one school with four teachers and 122 students. As of 1929, the population was about 600, but the Great Depression reduced this number by half.CROSBY, TX  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) World War II brought the population to over 900, and the population continued to grow. The site south of Highway 90 is historical Barrett Station.BARRETT, TX  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) Barrett's Settlement was founded by Harrison Barrett (1845‚Äì1917) and has been registered in the Texas Family Land Heritage as Texas Century Farm. Born into slavery, Barrett was the son of Simon and Lisa Barrett who came to Texas from Louisiana. He had two brothers and two sisters. Following the emancipation of Texas slaves in 1865, Barrett spent several years gathering his family together. He eventually found all of them except one sister, and they settled on land east of the San Jacinto River. He purchased this land in 1889 and began a community that later would be known as Barrett's Settlement. Beginning with seven houses, the community grew to include additional homes, farms, and businesses. Barrett established a school, church, and cemetery. After a post office station was opened there in 1947, the area became known as Barrett Station. Harrison Barrett's homestead, twice rebuilt by his descendants, stands on its original location.

The city is located in Harris County and is situated in Southeast Texas. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Deer Park was 32,010.  History  Deer Park was founded in 1892 by Simeon H. West, a farmer, retired legislator, and much-traveled adventurer from Illinois. He named the town for the large number of deer that roamed the Gulf plains. A railroad station opened later that year and a post office followed in 1893. The subdivision was established in 1893 and was the site of a Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway station by about 1894. A Deer Park post office was established in 1893, discontinued in 1919, and reestablished in 1930. In 1896, the community, with a population of forty, had a hotel, a general store, and three resident carpenters. By 1922 Deer Park had dwindled down to almost nothing with four houses, one little schoolhouse, and an old hotel with a few scattered shacks along the railroad right-of-way. 1928 brought in Shell Oil Company breaking ground on a new refinery. In the 1930s, an independent school district was established. By 1940, the population had grown to 100. By 1946, however, the area began to flourish as Deer Park became the site of refineries and toluene plants for the production of TNT. The citizens of Deer Park voted to incorporate on December 12, 1948, and a few weeks later Earl E. Dunn became the first mayor. Because of the 1948 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Deer Park's territory into its city limits.Lee, Ren√©e C. \\"Annexed Kingwood split on effects.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Population was 12,773 in 1970, and 28,520 in 2000. This growth has been fueled by the growth of the petrochemical industry as well as the growth of business along the Houston Ship Channel. Deer Park has a school district with 14 campuses, a city library, community theater, municipal court building, three fire stations, numerous city parks and recreational facilities, state-of-the-art water and sewer processing facilities, a post office, several hotels, 14 major industries as well as several light industrial companies. Today, Deer Park has approximately 9,000 homes and more than 30,000 residents. It is near the site of the Battle of San Jacinto, where, on April 21, 1836, Texas won its independence from Mexico. Because the initial surrender treaty after the battle was signed in Dr. George Moffitt Patrick's cabin, Deer Park bills itself as the \\"Birthplace of Texas\\". The original cabin was located on Buffalo Bayou where Rohm and Haas now has a chemical plant in Deer Park. A replica of Dr. Patrick's cabin is in front of the Theatre/Courts Building on Center Street.  Shell Chemical plant explosion  On June 22, 1997, an ethylene explosion occurred at the nearby Shell Chemical Company plant that was heard and felt as far as away.

With the coming of the petrochemical industry in the early 1900s, Clinton again transformed into a refinery center. Clinton attempted to establish a post office in 1935, but the request was denied as another Clinton, Texas, had established the name. The settlement's name was changed to Galena Park after the Galena Signal Oil Company of Texas, which built the first refinery there. Galena Park's original name survives today as the name of a major street in the city, Clinton Drive. Because of the 1935 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Galena Park's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.Lee, Ren√©e C. \\"Annexed Kingwood split on effects.\\" Houston Chronicle.

By the late 1930s Houston was growing as a port, so Galena Park expanded. Since the 1940s area residents considered the city to be a part of Greater Houston. The economy of Galena Park began to suffer in the early 1980s, when cranes used to haul ship cargo were reduced; prior to the early 1980s a team of workers, known on the docks as longshoremen, took up to one week to load cargo off of a ship. Many lived in the Galena Park area and contributed to its local economy. The use of cranes, however, led to ships unloading all cargo in less than one day.Harkinson, Josh. \\"All Aboard.\\" Houston Press. March 18, 2004. 1. The 1980s also hit Galena Park's economy with layoffs from the steel mills as the U.S. steel contracted due to overseas competition. The economy further decreased after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when seaport administrators tightened security rules that governed whether sailors could leave ships docked at port.

Hedwig Village is not considered to be within Houston proper as it is a separate incorporated city. History The Spring Branch Memorial area was originally settled by German immigrants in the 19th century. Hedwig Village's name originates from Hedwig Road, which was built on the property of Hedwig Jankowski Schroeder; Schroeder emigrated from Germany to Texas in 1906 to help her sister operate a business in Houston. There she met, and married, Henry Schroeder, son of Jacob Schroeder one of the area's earliest immigrants. They established their home and farmed in the area now Hedwig Village. In the mid 1950s, effort to form a Spring Branch municipality failed. Hedwig Village was incorporated on December 23, 1954 and established a zoning ordinance in 1955. Because of the 1955 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Hedwig Village's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.Lee, Ren√©e C. \\"Annexed Kingwood split on effects.\\" Houston Chronicle.

By 1966 the community had two schools, one library, and two churches. By 1970 the city had 3,255 residents, and in 1971 the city completed a park. The city had 3,994 residents in 1980 and 2,616 in 1990. Coller said in 2003 that many children of early Hedwig Village residents had begun to settle the Hedwig Village area.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 33,800. La Porte is the fourth-largest incorporated city in Harris County. When La Porte celebrated its centennial in 1992, it was the home of Barbours Cut Terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority since 1977. Fifteen years later, the Port of Houston's newest addition, Bayport Terminal, was established just south of La Porte. The area around La Porte has served an increasingly important role in international trade since the 1970s. The area around modern La Porte gained fame early in Texas history as the location of the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, which ended the Texas Revolution, establishing the independence of the Republic of Texas from Mexico. The San Jacinto Monument, in the unincorporated area of La Porte, commemorates the battle. During the early 20th century, particularly the 1920s and 1930s, La Porte's Sylvan Beach became a nationally known tourist destination attracting some of the nation's most well-known entertainers. As a result of changing economics in the Houston area and beach erosion, the tourist business declined while industrial development in the area grew. During World War II and afterward, La Porte's economy rapidly shifted toward petroleum/petrochemicals and shipping, which developed as the dominant industries in the Pasadena-Baytown area. History Five Points Plaza in La Porte Old Sylvan Beach Depot Entrance to Sylvan Beach Pavilion The community of La Porte was founded in 1892 as a speculative real estate venture by an investment group. Texas State Historical Association. A public space known as Sylvan Grove was reserved by the waterfront. The area around Sylvan Grove soon was developed with amenities including bathhouses, boating piers, and a Victorian hotel with a dance pavilion. La Porte quickly became the most popular tourist destination in the Houston area.Antrobus (2005), p. 51-52. Sylvan Grove Park was acquired in 1896 by a company known as Adoue and Lobit and renamed Sylvan Beach. Cottage retreats were built around the waterfront. In 1900, the devastating Galveston Hurricane hit the shoreline, seriously damaging the community's attractions. As the Texas Oil Boom took hold beginning in 1901, and neighboring Houston became home to many wealthy businessmen, La Porte quickly rebuilt and re-established itself as a tourist center. It was, however, damaged again by a major fire and another hurricane in 1915. The community rebuilt again. During the 1920s and 1930s Sylvan Beach Amusement Park became a nationally recognized destination, featuring beauty contests and regular performances by famous bands, in addition to a growing gallery of amenities. Some of the most well-known performers of the era, including Guy Lombardo, the Dorsey Brothers, Phil Harris, and Benny Goodman, appeared at the park. In the 1930s the park was completely revamped, with additions of a large boardwalk, amusement rides, and many other attractions. The residential community remained small, supported exclusively by Sylvan Beach tourism and the nearby Bay Ridge community, an area of beachfront summer homes in neighboring Morgan's Point built by wealthy Houstonians. The beachfront began to physically shrink beginning around 1928 because of erosion from the wakes of shipping traffic, and land subsidence resulting from the extraction of groundwater in the area due to development. Gas rationing in World War II slowed tourism. A hurricane in 1943 destroyed most of the tourist attractions. Most of the damaged structures at Sylvan Beach were never rebuilt after this time, as the area was changing, and La Porte's tourist industry rapidly declined. By the later 20th century, erosion had completely eliminated the beach. As shipyards and industrial plants in World War II were developed in nearby communities such as Pasadena, Baytown, and Deer Park, the community's residents became more dependent on these businesses. The opening of the La Porte-Baytown tunnel in 1954 further spurred development. The later establishment of the Johnson Space Center in the nearby Clear Lake Area, the Barbours Cut shipping terminal in neighboring Morgan's Point, and the Bayport Industrial District within La Porte's jurisdiction have gradually made the community successful as part of the Houston area's industrial heartland. Much of the history of La Porte's glory years as a tourist haven has been preserved by the La Porte Bay Area Heritage Society. Plans have been discussed for many years to restore La Porte's status as a tourist destination. A project to restore the beachfront at Sylvan Beach Park began in 2009 and finished in 2013, with sand brought in from other areas and dredging operations. Other plans, including building a large hotel on the shoreline, have been discussed as well.

As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 339. , it has approximately 362 residents and is located within the La Porte Independent School District. Morgan's Point National Historic District includes the \\"Carriage House\\" otherwise known as City Hall, and the Governor Ross S. Sterling mansion directly across the street; as well as several other notable properties. It earned fame in Texas's early history for being the home of the legendary Emily West (Morgan), known as \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\". It later became a Houston-area resort community for the wealthy in the early 20th century. Morgan's Point City Hall Morgan's Point Cemetery History Morgan's Point (1912) The area was first settled in 1822 by Nicholas Rightor, a surveyor commissioned by Stephen F. Austin to explore and survey the areas between the Brazos and Lavaca rivers. He soon sold the property to Johnson Calhoun Hunter, and it subsequently was bought by Joseph C. Clopper, who used the property to grow orange and lemon trees. The property was finally sold to James Morgan in 1834, who established the short-lived colony of New Washington. Morgan had helped supply the Texian army during the Texas Revolution and was given the rank of colonel. The settlement was destroyed by the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. A legend surfaced much later surrounding a mulatto woman named Emily West. She became an indentured servant (but not a slave) of Morgan and, according to legend, used her beauty to occupy Mexican General Santa Anna, thereby facilitating his capture by the Texan army, thus ending the revolutionary war. Historians differ on the degree of truth of this legend. The area began to redevelop as the Houston Ship Channel was dredged near the area in the later 19th century. The community grew around traffic crossing the ship channel to and from Goose Creek (now Baytown). Ferry service would eventually become established. The Morgan Point Ferry operated until the mid 20th century. Following the start of the Texas oil boom in 1901 Galveston Bay became an attractive summer destination for the wealthy from Houston and nearby areas. Plots along Bayridge Road were sold for the construction of summer homes, including the famed Sterling Mansion, a former governor's residence that is now a landmark (not to be confused with the mansion in Houston). During the 1920s and '30s the shoreline between Morgan's Point and Sylvan Beach came to be known as the Texas \\"Gold Coast\\", a playground for the rich. As the surrounding communities of La Porte and Pasadena grew, interest in the area as a summer haven diminished. Morgan's Point was finally incorporated in 1949, and a small community remained. Some of the original 19th century buildings have remained, as well as early 20th century homes. The area received a major economic boost in 1977 with the opening of the Barbours Cut shipping terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority. However, in building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the community's homes. Still the terminal almost instantly became the Houston area's most important shipping point and became the centerpiece of the economy activity at Morgan's Point.

The population was 54,298 at the 2010 census. While the name \\"Spring\\" is popularly applied to a large area of northern Harris County and a smaller area of southern Montgomery County, the original town of Spring, now known as Old Town Spring, is located at the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses a relatively small area of perhaps 1 km2. History The large geographic area now known as Spring was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In 1836, the Texas General Council of the Provisional Government placed what is now the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In 1838, William Pierpont placed a trading post on Spring Creek. In 1840, the town of Spring had 153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including Gus Bayer and Carl Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from Louisiana and other parts of the post-Civil War Southern U.S. settled in Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; area residents also grew vegetables. In 1871, the International and Great Northern Railroad, built through Spring, opened, which caused Spring to expand. In 1873, Spring received a post office. By 1884, Spring had 150 residents, two steam saw and grist mills, two cotton gins, three churches, and several schools. In 1901‚Äì1903, the International-Great Northern Railroad opened, connecting Spring to Fort Worth. Spring, now with a roundhouse, became a switchyard with 200 rail workers and fourteen track yards. The population increased to 1,200 by 1910. The Spring State Bank opened in 1912. In 1923, the roundhouse relocated to Houston, causing Spring to enter a decline; by 1931, Spring had 300 people. The bank was robbed several times in the 1930s; it was stated that Bonnie and Clyde robbed the bank once. The bank consolidated with Tomball Bank in 1935. By 1947, Spring had 700 residents. In the 1970s, Houston's suburbs began to expand to the north, and more subdivisions and residential areas opened in the Spring area. Some older houses in the town of Spring received restorations and housed shops. The Old Town Spring Association opened in 1980 to promote the Old Town Spring shopping area, which consists of the restored houses. In 1984 and 1989, the Spring area had 15,000 residents. By 1989, Old Town Spring became a tourist area. In 1990, the Spring area had 33,111 residents. From 1969 to 1992, the Goodyear airship America was based in Spring from its large hangar visible just off Interstate 45. Takeoffs and landings were a major attraction and motorists continually pulled off to the interstate's shoulders to watch. In 1992 the America was moved to Akron, Ohio, and the massive hangar was eventually torn down. As of 2020, the hangar's concrete foundation is still visible at the intersection of Holzwarth Road and Meadow Edge Lane west of Lowe's Home Improvement Center. The 1992 Log Cabin Republicans convention was held in Spring. Geography Map of Spring CDP (as of 2000) Spring is located at (30.054127, -95.386991).

Old Town Spring is north of the city of Houston and outside Beltway 8. Many of the original buildings, some over a hundred years old, now house places to buy antiques, collectibles, clothing, and gifts. Wunsche Bros. Saloon was the first two-story building erected in Old Town Spring. It is still standing today, although not currently open for business after a fire. The population in the Old Town Spring area started growing in the early 19th century when the Spanish and French came to trade with the local Akokisa (Orcoquisac) Indians. The small town grew consistently until the early 20th century. At one time the town had as many as five saloons and a gambling hall. The town thrived on the booming railroad business in South Texas and resulting industrialization. After the Depression, Prohibition, and a relocation of the railroad headquarters, the small town slowly declined in population until Houston's Oil boom in the 1970s and 1980s brought merchants back to the area to make the town what it is today. This town is rumored to have been a robbery victim of Bonnie and Clyde. Though the bank building still has bullet holes from several robberies in the 1920s and 1930s. In 2015, a parish of the Greater Church of Lucifer opened in the town, which resulted in over a hundred protestors. The Greater Church of Lucifer in Old Town Spring closed in April 2016.

In the mid-1950s, effort to form a Spring Branch municipality (proposed to be called the city of Spring Branch in roughly the area known today as the Memorial Villages) failed. The city incorporated in 1955 as Spring Valley. There had been two elections for incorporation. The first result was against incorporation, and state law mandated that the next election for incorporation of the same boundary would have to be held at least one year later. Some advocates of incorporation convinced Robert R. Casey, then a Harris county judge, to modify the boundary of the proposed area by removing the Campbell Place area and therefore many voters who opposed incorporating. The following election, held on April 9, 1955, was in favor of incorporation, 183 for and 165 against.Meeks, Flori. \\"Community - Fight failed to make Spring Branch a city - Proposal to incorporate followed by establishment of Memorial Villages.\\" Houston Chronicle.

As a result, many West University streets are named after authors, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Dryden, and William Shakespeare.

One street, Weslayan Road, is a misspelling of \\"Wesleyan.\\" The City of West University Place was declared incorporated by the County Judge of Harris County on January 2, 1924. The city incorporated because Houston was reluctant to extend power lines that far from the city center. West University Place, unlike Houston Heights, did not consolidate into the City of Houston. Because of the 1923 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate West University Place's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. In 1939, the municipality refused to consolidate, later adopting a formal city charter the following year. The city had around 15,000 residents in the 1960s and the 1970s. The city had 12,714 people in 1990. Prior to 1992 West University Place liberalized its development rules. This allowed developers to build new houses within the city. Don Stowers of the Houston Post said that West University Place changed from an \\"aging middle-class neighborhood\\" consisting of mid-20th century bungalows and cottages to an increasingly wealthy community of \\"dare we say, young urban professionals in their austere red-brick Georgians.\\"Stowers, Don. \\"Bellaire small-town flavor, big-city convenience.\\" Houston Post.

As new houses appeared, property values increased and the city began to get more tax revenue. Eventually, West University Place ran out of available lots, and its construction peaked. Area home buyers began to consider nearby Bellaire because it had more inexpensive and larger lots, and amenities described by Stowers as \\"comparable\\" to West University Place's amenities.

(See map) The Poor Farm Ditch is a ditch that drains into the Brays Bayou that formerly belonged to the Harris County poor farm. In 1928 the ditch was dredged after significant flooding had occurred in the area. On occasions the ditch still flooded. The commissioners of the City of West University adjourned their meeting so they could dam streets in December 1935. The Harris County Flood Control District, in 1954, widened and deepened the ditch and added a concrete bottom and siding. During that year the district installed a chain link fence. To make the ditch more attractive, the Sunset Terrace Garden Club planted oleanders around the ditch; the oleanders obscure the view of the ditch from Edloe Street to the east. The West University Garden Club maintained the flowers. A 2001 Edloe Greenbelt proposal called for the removal of the flowers.

First Baptist Church in Hallsville Hallsville is a city in Harrison County, Texas, United States, located west of the county seat, Marshall, on U.S. Highway 80. The population was 3,577 at the 2010 census, up from 2,772 at the 2000 census.  History =Past The area was first settled in 1839, when Fort Crawford was built one mile west of the site of present Hallsville by W. C. Crawford as a protection against Indians. In 1849 the fort is reported to have had a post office and a two-story building that served as church, Masonic hall, and school (the only school in western Harrison County until 1868). In 1869, when an independent Southern Pacific Railway crossed a mile north of Fort Crawford, the settlers moved to the railroad and named the new settlement for a railroad official. All that remains at the original location is a cemetery. A post office named \\"Hallville\\" opened in 1869, and the first business in the new community was a saloon. From 1869 to 1872 the town was the terminus of the railroad, and the railroad company built a general office and machine shops there. The community incorporated for the first time in 1870 and was a boom town, with as many as fifty businesses, in the early 1870s. Hallville shipped cotton, wool, and hides. In 1872, when the Texas and Pacific acquired the railroad and built out to Longview in Gregg County, Hallville lost much of its western trade. In 1873 the railroad moved its local headquarters and shops to Marshall. Hallville's incorporation lapsed, and the community lost many of its people to Marshall in the later 1870s. In 1884 it had an estimated 600 inhabitants, three churches, six sawmills, six grist mill-gins, a hotel, two saloons, and a cooperative association. By 1892 the population had fallen to 300, but it recovered to 600 in the 1900s. In 1904 the Hallville school district had two schools serving 180 white pupils and one school serving 111 black pupils. A bank opened in the community in 1909. In the 1920s the post office changed the spelling of its name to Hallsville. The community reincorporated in 1935. Present Until 2003, Hallsville had only one traffic light, located at the main intersection at Main Street (HWY 80) and FM 450. The town has experienced rapid growth in the past decade and now boasts five traffic lights, a larger corporate grocery store chain, a medical and dental clinic, two dollar stores and several fast- food chains. The heart and pulse of the community still lies in its school functions, particularly sporting events.

It is the county seat of Hartley County. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 363. History The XIT Ranch office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Channing was founded in 1888 by George Channing Rivers, a paymaster for the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway. The settlement was originally called Rivers. Since the name Rivers duplicated another community in Texas, the name was changed to Channing later that year. Channing developed directly from its association with the XIT Ranch, a property that once included land in as many as ten counties in the Texas Panhandle. In 1891, Willis D. Twitchell platted Channing's business district. At that time, Channing was the headquarters of the XIT. Albert Boyce, the ranch's general manager and one of the most prominent early citizens, built the first house in the community. By 1900, Channing had two stores, a post office, lumber yard, and school. Two elections, one in November 1896 and the other in 1903, were required for Channing to replace Hartley as county seat. The frame courthouse was pulled to Channing on wheels by mounted XIT cowboys in 1903. A brick courthouse was completed in 1906 and the original courthouse was converted into the once famous Hotel Rivers. One of the first public libraries in the Panhandle was established in 1908 by a local women's club. The estimated population at this time was about 600. The XIT, which conducted most of its business from Channing, was the town's chief customer until liquidation of the ranch in 1911. The local economy was severely impacted, although the real estate market temporarily thrived from the sale of XIT lands. A fire swept through the business district on September 6, 1931, destroying seven buildings including Hotel Rivers. By 1940, Channing had an estimated population of 475 with several businesses, a high school, and three churches. A restored XIT office building is located in Channing as a museum. Channing was incorporated in 1960. At the time of incorporation, the population was 390. The number of inhabitants declined to 336 in 1970, 304 in 1980, and 277 in 1990, mainly because of its accessibility to larger communities like Dalhart and Amarillo. By 2000, the population rose to 356, a 28.5 percent increase over the 1990 figure. City government consists of a mayor and two city council members. Mayor Karen Schulz was elected to fill a vacancy in May 2009. Current council members are Ms. Janie Ray and Ms. Betty Edwards. Law enforcement is provided by the Hartley County Sheriff's Office as the City does not have a police force of its own. Fire protection for the City, and much of southern Hartley County is provided by an all volunteer fire department, headquartered in the City. Fire Chief as of October 2009 was Jeremy Tunnell. As of October 2009 there were a limited number of businesses operating in the City, a cafe, mercantile and a rendering plant. Most citizens were either involved in ranching, dairy or other agricultural professions, or were employed in businesses in surrounding communities.

Hartley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hartley County, Texas, United States. The population was 540 at the 2010 census. History In 1832, John Charles Beales and Jose Manuel Royella were granted the section where Hartley is now located under colonization laws of Mexico and Texas. They represented the Arkansas and Texas Land Company; however, they failed to colonize this territory and they forfeited their rights. In 1875, the Texas Legislature passed an act which allowed contractors to clear one mile of the river Sabine, Angeline, and Neches, and the Pine Island Bayou in exchange for land grants. The contractors were required to survey the land, return field notes to the Land Commissioner and request him to number the sections. The contractors then received a deed to the uneven numbered sections with the State retaining the even-numbered ones as school lands. The field notes of Beaty, Seale, and Forwood were filed November 17, 1875. The only other deeds registered in the county prior to 1884 were those of the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad, Brooks and Burleson, Gunter and Burleson and W.M. Lee. On July 1, 1888, Beaty, Seale, and Forwood sold Section 23 to James A. Hudson of Logan County, Illinois and John A. Lutz of New York for $10,000.00. They sold the right of way to the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad July 1, 1888. Many changes occurred in a very short time. Handbills were distributed throughout the eastern and southern states by the owners who were anxious to turn Hartley into a booming metropolis. Section 23 was plotted into lots and registered with the Land Commissioner of Texas. A tent city came into being and grew rapidly as people came with high expectations and determination to make for themselves a new life in a new land.

The population was 7,295 in 2010, up from 2,404 at the 2000 census. In 2018 the estimated population was 16,449. Buda is part of the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan statistical area and is one of Austin's fastest growing suburbs. Residents of Buda are referred to as Budans. History The town of Buda sprang up along the route of the International-Great Northern Railroad, which was extended from Austin to San Antonio in 1880. Buda bore the name of \\"Du Pre\\" from its birth in 1881 until the autumn of 1887, when postal officials became aware that another Texas town was also named Du Pre. Cornelia Trimble platted the town of Du Pre on April 1, 1881, establishing streets and a wide \\"Reservation\\" between the lots and the railroad right of way, which allowed the railroad to place buildings on the parkland, including the depot that would become the lifeblood of the town over the next few decades. Several businesses sprang up, including the Carrington Hotel, which served meals to railroad travelers. By the time Du Pre found a new name for itself, the Carrington hotel was known as the \\"Buda House\\". The \\"Dupre Notes\\" column of the Sept. 25, 1886, edition of the Hays County Times and Farmer's Journal notes that \\"The Buda House is one of the best hotels in the state. The polite and entertaining hostess, Mrs. Carrington, meets all with a courteous welcome.\\" According to the town's oral tradition, \\"Buda\\" is a corruption of the Spanish word viuda, or \\"widow\\", referencing the widows who supposedly worked as cooks at the Carrington Hotel. Others suggest that like the town of Buda, Illinois, the town name is a nod to the exiles of the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 who settled in the area. Buda was incorporated in 1948. By the mid-1980s it had attracted a cement plant and some craft industry. Geography Buda is in northeastern Hays County, at (30.084229, ‚àí97.839081).

The population was 648 at the 2010 census. From the early 1850s until the 1880s, Mountain City was a sprawling community on the old Stagecoach Road that served as an important hub in the ranching and farming industries of the newly formed Hays County. The original Mountain City was centered near the modern community of the same name, but stretched from the Blanco River around present-day Kyle all the way to Manchaca Springs northeast of present-day Buda. The first settlers, such as Chattanooga native Phillip Allen and his family, landed in Mountain City around the time of the Texas Revolution in 1835 and 1836. Allen had acquired more than of land in what would become northern Hays County from Ben Milam's colony grant from the Republic of Texas. But American Indians in the area fought to maintain control of their ancestral lands, driving the settlers away. Allen left to fight against Mexico for Texas independence. In 1846, after the Texas Rangers had been enlisted to drive out the Indians, Allen and his family successfully settled their land. When Hays County was formed two years later, Allen became one of the first commissioners and was active in local politics until his death in 1860. Another early family was the Buntons. Tennessee native John Wheeler Bunton moved to Texas in the early 1830s, signed the Declaration of Texas Independence, and served on the first Texas legislature. Just after the Texas Revolution, Bunton returned to Tennessee to marry his sweetheart, and brought back with him a company of 140 settlers for the new frontier. But while traveling by steamer from New Orleans to Texas, their ship was captured by a Mexican man of war and the party was imprisoned in Mexico city for three days. According to historical lore, Bunton's smooth- talking wife, Mary Howell Bunton, convinced their captors that they were American citizens legally entering Texas under the colonization law granted by Mexico to Stephen F. Austin. After their release, the Buntons continued on to Mountain City, where they built their \\"Rancho Rambolette\\" and began to farm and raise a family. Other early settlers included families such as the Vaughans, Bartons, Barbers, Porters, Moores, Rectors and Turners. The Texas population began to grow rapidly in the 1850s, and Mountain City was no exception. By the 1850s, the small farming and ranching community was starting to thrive, with schools, churches, businesses, mills and gins. In 1855, the community built its first school, Live Oak Academy, with a professor Gibson as the first teacher, followed by John Edgar. The satellite communities of Elm Grove and Science Hall, near the sites of the recently constructed schools by the same names, also had schools and small commercial centers. 1855 also saw the formation of the first house of worship, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Baptist and Methodist churches followed in the 1870s. Along with the churches came the Chicago bar, located on the southern end of Mountain City, near the present day location of Wallace Middle School. Col. W.W. Haupt, who came to Mountain City in 1857, opened a store around the location of the current Hays High School that became home to the Mountain City post office; he also served as postmaster. Two other prominent stores, run by Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Barber, were located about a mile north. The civil war era saw a population boom, and many young men of Mountain City served in the 32nd Cavalry regiment under Col. P.C. Woods and Capt. J.G. Story. But much like the small towns of the 1940s that would wither when bypassed by the interstate, Mountain City's fate depended on the railroad coming to town. For isolated communities at the mercy of the slow stagecoach line for communication with the world at large, the railroad was truly a life-changing development, bringing mail service, trade, and connections with the bustling cities of Austin and San Antonio. The fight for a depot was fierce, and the family of State Senator Fergus Kyle, living in the Blanco River area south of Mountain City, had the political connections to get the tracks laid through their neck of the woods, bypassing Mountain City to the east. The Kyle family deeded to the International-Great Northern Railroad, securing their place in history as founders of a town that would bear their name. From that moment on, Mountain City's days were numbered. As the fledgling railroad towns of Buda and Kyle sprang to life in the early 1880s, the residents of Mountain City began their exodus. Mountain City quickly dried up. Local schools hung on through the early 1930s, the only hint that the area had once been the regional center of commerce.

The population was 5,672 at the 2010 census, up from 5,145 at the 2000 census. The town began as an unincorporated community known as the \\"Old Bethel Community\\" in the 1960s after completion of Cedar Creek Reservoir. It was incorporated in the late 1960s so it could legally sell beer and wine. The city takes its name from a former road, Gun Barrel Lane (which is now State Highway 198), as has as its motto, \\"We Shoot Straight with You\\", and its symbol - a rifle with two crossed antique pistols after having to remove Yosemite Sam as its unofficial mascot that once graced its signs along the road at the city limits. It is rumored that Gun Barrel Lane got its name during the 1920s and 1930s when Jesse Daniels frequented the area. It was considered a safe backwoods place during Prohibition when the likes of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker hung out in the area. The road got its name for simply being \\"straight as a gun barrel\\" for two miles between hwy 175 and hwy 334 to the south. A local resident, Mr. C. L. Wait, lived along the road and was known for sitting at the window of his house with a shotgun sticking out the window. It was his way of deterring those he deemed unwelcome on this back country road.  History  Despite having a name that evokes images of the Texas frontier, Gun Barrel City is only about 50 years old. Not long after Cedar Creek Lake (a reservoir for the Tarrant Regional Water District) completed construction, the fledgling community that sat on its banks took steps to officially become a city. Gun Barrel City was incorporated on May 26, 1969. Since that time, it has grown into a main hub and access point for the waters of Cedar Creek Lake. This has led visitors from around the region to use Gun Barrel City as the gateway into the lake. In addition to the high amount of tourism that the community experiences (particularly during the summer boating season), Gun Barrel City and the surrounding communities have experienced a residential building boom over the past several years. This growth has largely been led by the relocation of retirees from throughout the Dallas region, building lake homes to take advantage of Gun Barrel City's lake access. In May 2000, Gun Barrel City voters elected their 13th mayor, 21-year-old entrepreneur and newspaper publisher Randal Tye Thomas, who became a media and political celebrity in the Dallas metropolitan area. After a very successful year as mayor, marked by widespread community support, he resigned after community outcry in May 2001 following a grand jury indictment for one count of misdemeanor perjury and in the same week being arrested by the Gun Barrel City Police Department for public intoxication. All criminal charges were eventually dismissed. Thomas and the community were featured in many local, state, and national publications and programs, including a feature story in Texas Monthly and a feature interview on the popular nationwide NPR program This American Life. Thomas moved to the Dallas area in 2002, and died in 2014. In 2008, Gun Barrel City received the coveted Certified Retirement Community recognition from the Texas Department of Agriculture's Go Texan program. The community has also received recognition from the governor's office, receiving second place on two separate occasions in the governor's Community Achievement Awards.Gun Barrel City municipal website, http://www.gunbarrelcity.net Geography Gun Barrel City is located in northwestern Henderson County, on the eastern shore of Cedar Creek Lake, part of the Trinity River watershed.

Education Moore Station is served by the Brownsboro Independent School District. History Anderson and Lucinda Moore, for whom the town is believed to have been named, were a pioneer family in the area; according to one source, they were former slaves. In 1876 they donated a plot of land for a Methodist church and for a school. The church and school made up the original Moore Station. Many freed slaves moved to the area from nearby Fincastle after slavery to purchase land and enjoy their newfound freedom. From the 1870 census the following were residents of the area: *Ralph Calhoun, Martha Calhoun, with children Harriath Calhoun, William Calhoun, Mahalia Calhoun, Sallie Calhoun *Anderson Moore, Lucinda Moore, with children Rovana and Susan Moore *Hannah Moore, grandchildren George Peet, John Mills, Alzera Mills *Flora Dickinson, with children Joshua and Sara Dickinson *James and Ghana Brownfield, with children Lucinda, Mattie and Nettie *Addison Cofer and Mary Jane Larkin, with children Addison Cofer Jr. , Norton Cofer, and Omega Cofer After emancipation freedman began to sharecrop with their former masters in communities like Fincastle, Pleasant Ridge and New York. Around 1872 they soon began to leave behind former plantations like Crossroads, Flat Creek, Stockard and such, and former masters such as Ratliff, Faulk, Wofford and Coleman. They began to purchase land in the Moore Station area, including the Andersons, Cofers, Douglases and Hightowers. These slaves were brought into Texas from South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia by the pioneer families. These pioneer families were descendants of Huguenots who were escaping religious persecution in Europe. Some were descendants of the founding fathers, families like John O. Bullard, William Weatherford, Lachlan Durant, the Faulk brothers and others who migrated into the Deep South, which was Native American in the 1700s, to uproot tribes like the Creek and Seminole people. In order to get a foothold into the deep South, some married into the tribes and began to raise families. They established outposts like Fort Mims and Little Tallassee in Alabama. This action later led to the infamous Trail of Tears. Most of the population of present-day Moore Station are descendants of their slaves such as Lousia Durant, Addison/Adderson Cofer and Ralph Calhoun. The Cofer descendants still own more than 250 acres of land in Moore Station, Texas passed down generations as of 2019.

The population was 15,798 at the 2010 census. History Donna is in southeastern Hidalgo County, east of McAllen, in territory that was granted to Lino Cabazos as part of the La Blanca land grant on May 19, 1834, by the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The Cabazos family inhabited the area for at least twenty years after taking possession of the land, and their descendants continued to live in the area into the twentieth century. The first known Anglo-American settler was John F. Webber, who, accompanied by his wife Sylvia (Hector), a former slave, settled in the area in 1839. The Webbers moved to the area in order to escape persecution for their interracial marriage. Several families from northern states, including the Ruthven, Champion, and Hooks families, settled the area. Thomas Jefferson Hooks arrived in the Lower Rio Grande valley in 1900 and the following year moved his family to Run in southeastern Hidalgo County. In May 1902 he helped to form the La Blanca Agricultural Company, which purchased fronting the river east and west of the site of present Donna and extending north . He gave part of his purchase to his 21-year-old daughter, Donna Hooks Fletcher, a divorc√©e. She settled in the area and established the Alameda (Grove) Ranch. Fletcher stocked the ranch with Jersey cattle purchased from the Lassater Ranch in Falfurrias and ran a successful butter business. The Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (later called the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the site in July 1904, when the town was founded. In 1907 the town received a depot and was named \\"Donna\\" in honor of Donna Fletcher, who was postmistress when the Donna post office opened in 1908. That year the first store in west Donna was established by Ed Ruthven, and the community was recognized as the Texas station that shipped the most produce in a year. A 500-ton-capacity sugar mill was built in Donna that year. The Donna Developer was first printed on December 1, 1910, in Chapin. That year the Community Church was constructed and shared by the town's Protestant groups. The First Presbyterian Church was founded on July 10, and the First Baptist Church was organized on July 24, 1910. The telephone exchange was installed in 1911. Donna incorporated on April 13, 1911. By 1912 the town was divided into Donna and East Donna. East Donna, the Mexican side of town, had a post office named \\"Beatriz\\", after Beatriz Hooks, from 1912 to 1916. Saint Joseph Catholic Church and a school for Mexican children were located there. A store was moved from Run to Donna in 1914 by Andrew Champion. In 1915 Donna had a population of 1,500, a bank, a hotel, four churches, two cotton gins, the sugar mill, and a weekly newspaper named the Donna Dispatch, published by B. L. Brooks. In 1916 the Donna Light and Power Company was incorporated by A. F. Hester, Sr., T. J. Hooks, Dr. J. B. Roberts, and twenty stockholders. The American Legion Hall, Donna Border Post No. 107, was dedicated in 1920. Donna had an estimated population of 1,579 in 1925. By 1936 it had a population of 4,103, a railroad stop, multiple dwellings, and 110 businesses. The citizens of Donna first started using the motto \\"The City with a Heart in the Heart of the Rio Grande Valley\\" to promote the city in the 1940s. By 1945 the town had a population of 4,712 and 78 businesses, and it continued to be a citrus and vegetable growing center. In 1953 Donna had three gins, three wholesale groceries, hardware and farm implements dealers, a wholesale distributor for feed mills, and the Donna News. The election of 1954 drew attention to Donna when Bob Jefferys, a newspaperman, requested that a special contingent of Texas Rangers be sent to the city by Governor Allan Shivers. He alleged that the election campaign was becoming violent because political bosses were physically threatening voters. The American Legion Hall was designated a historical landmark in 1964. In 1967 Donna reported 110 businesses (including eight manufacturers), ten churches, a bank, a library, and a newspaper. From 1920 through the mid-1960s Donna had segregated schools.

In 1867 he purchased one square league () of the Santa Anita Land Grant from John and Salome Balli McAllen. In the era spanning 1880 to 1890, he acquired more adjacent real estate holdings to yield a ranch over in extent; during this decade he grazed cattle, horses, and mules, and became an exporter of donkeys to Cuba. The first citrus trees in Hidalgo County were planted within the ranch property. Vela's grandson, Reynaldo Vela, discovered an artesian well which supplies a lake of about in size, which lake was historically and inexplicably called Dry Lake. In the year 1975 a historical marker was placed at the ranch. In recent times family members manage the ranch holding, although it is subdivided into three tangent parcels. In 1871, his daughter, Carlota, grew the first orange trees in Hidalgo County from the seeds of a fruit given her by a traveling priest. This is now an important citrus-producing area. The ranch had grown to when a school was built here in 1892. Delfina Post Office, named for another one of Vela's daughters, was opened in 1893 and a Catholic church in 1894.

Geography Mercedes is located in southeastern Hidalgo County at (26.149315, -97.918675). It is bordered to the west by Weslaco and to the east, in Cameron County, by La Feria.

It is one of the oldest towns in the Rio Grande Valley, and the city celebrated its centennial in 2007. The city was located in Capisallo Pasture, part of Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Welles. This location was known as the Pear Orchard because of the vast numbers of prickly pear cactus growing there at that time. Some sources state that the original name given to the city was \\"Diaz\\" in honor of Porfirio Diaz, then president of Mexico. Later it was supposedly renamed \\"Mercedes Diaz\\" in honor of the president's wife, and from that, Mercedes became the Queen City. This story, however, is historically inaccurate, given that neither of Diaz's two wives were named Mercedes. General Zachary Taylor's headquarters was to the southeast of Mercedes near the Rio Grande.

The existence of this cluster of particles is not supported by current models of nuclear forces. There is some empirical evidence suggesting that this particle does exist, based on a 2001 experiment by Francisco-Miguel Marqu√©s and co- workers at the Ganil accelerator in Caen using a novel detection method in observations of the disintegration of beryllium and lithium nuclei. However, subsequent attempts to replicate this observation have failed. Further work in 2019 suggests potentially observable consequences in neutron star crusts, if the tetraneutron exists.  Marqu√©s' experiment  As with many particle accelerator experiments, Marques' team fired atomic nuclei at carbon targets and observed the \\"spray\\" of particles from the resulting collisions. In this case the experiment involved firing beryllium-14, beryllium-15 and lithium-11 nuclei at a small carbon target, the most successful being beryllium-14. This isotope of beryllium has a nuclear halo that consists of four clustered neutrons; this allows it to be easily separated intact in the high-speed collision with the carbon target. Current nuclear models suggest that four separate neutrons should result when beryllium-10 is produced, but the single signal detected in the production of beryllium-10 suggested a multineutron cluster in the breakup products; most likely a beryllium-10 nucleus and four neutrons fused together into a tetraneutron.  Since Marqu√©s' experiment  A later analysis of the detection method used in the Marques' experiment suggested that at least part of the original analysis was flawed, and attempts to reproduce these observations with different methods have not successfully detected any neutron clusters. If, however, the existence of stable tetraneutrons were ever independently confirmed, considerable adjustments would have to be made to current nuclear models. Bertulani and Zelevinsky proposed that, if it existed, the tetraneutron could be formed by a bound state of two dineutron systems. However, attempts to model interactions that might give rise to multineutron clusters have failed, and it \\"does not seem possible to change modern nuclear Hamiltonians to bind a tetraneutron without destroying many other successful predictions of those Hamiltonians. This means that, should a recent experimental claim of a bound tetraneutron be confirmed, our understanding of nuclear forces will have to be significantly changed.\\" In 2016 researchers at RIKEN in Wako, Japan observed evidence that the tetraneutron exists briefly as a resonance. They fired a beam of neutron-rich helium-8 nuclei (two protons and six neutrons) at a liquid target composed of helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons). Occasionally, the reaction produced beryllium-8 nuclei with four protons and four neutrons, leaving four neutrons unaccounted for. If a four-neutron nucleus did occur, it lasted for about 10‚àí21 seconds before decaying into other particles.

Contemporary use can particularly refer to a beginner or new user of computers, often concerning internet activity, such as online gaming or Linux use. Depending on the context and spelling variant used, the term can have derogatory connotations (and be used as a term of abuse in internet-based games)‚Äîbut is also often used for descriptive purposes only, without any value judgment. The origin of this term is uncertain. Earliest uses probably date to late twentieth century United States Armed Forces jargon, though possible precursor terms are much earlier. Variant forms of the noun include newby and newbee, while the related term noob (often stylized as \\"n00b\\") is often used in online gaming. History Its etymology is uncertain. It may derive from \\"newie\\", which is attested in U.S. and Australian sources of the 1850s, meaning a neophyte in a place or situation; alternatively, it may derive from the British public school slang \\"new boy\\" or \\"new blood\\", which is attributed to the same era and was applied to a schoolboy in his first term.\\"newbie\\" The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989, OED Online, Oxford University Press, (subscription needed) March 8, 2010.

Deal, and Dan Cragg, A Dictionary of Soldier Talk, New York: Scribner, 1984, p. 209. Another use of the term newbee was the moniker given to new U.S. Navy recruit students attending Basic Electricity and Electronics school by more senior students, a requisite course prior to enrollment in the A-school course at Naval Air Technical Training Center, Millington, Tennessee. Its earliest known usage on the internet may have been on the Usenet newsgroup talk.bizarre. The term is believed to have entered online usage by 1981.

The largest component is oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. Emu oil also contains roughly 20% linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and 1‚Äì2% linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). Fully refined emu oil has a bland flavour. Commercial emu oil supplements are not standardised and vary widely in their potency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration highlighted emu oils in a 2009 article on \\"How to Spot Health Fraud\\", pointing out that many \\"pure emu oil\\" products are unapproved drugs. Research As of 2019 there have been at least three randomised controlled trials in humans. A first study (n=42) suggests a trend for reduced skin toxicity for patients receiving emu oil during radiation therapy; a second RCT (n=22) found that a gel containing emu oil was possibly effective as a topical treatment for acute phase Peyronie's disease; and a third study failed to show a greater efficacy for emu oil over placebo in a population of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer experiencing arthralgias following initiation of an aromatase inhibitor (n=73).

As of the 2010 census the population was 35,670, and in 2019 the estimated population was 41,629. It is located at the southern tip of Texas in the Rio Grande Valley near the Mexican border, across the Rio Grande from the city of Nuevo Progreso, Rio Bravo, Tamaulipas. Weslaco derives its name from the W.E. Stewart Land Company.Temple, Robert D. Edge Effects: The Border-Name Places, (2nd edition, 2009), iUniverse, , page 324. It was the hometown of Harlon Block, one of the Marines photographed raising the flag at Iwo Jima, and of film and television actor David Spielberg. Streets north of the railroad tracks have Spanish names, and streets south of the railroad tracks bear names in English, as a consequence of a 1921 municipal ordinance which declared that land north of the tracks be reserved for Hispanic residences and businesses, and land south of the tracks be reserved for \\"Anglo\\" residences and businesses. During World War II, sandbag production reached a peak in Weslaco, and the town declared itself the \\"sandbagging capital of the world\\". Weslaco is part of the McAllen‚ÄìEdinburg‚ÄìMission and Reynosa‚ÄìMcAllen metropolitan areas. History San Pius X Catholic Church The present location of Weslaco was originally part of the Llano Grande land grant to Juan Jos√© Ynojosa de Ball√≠ in 1790. After Ynojosa's death, the grant was allocated to his children. Manuela and Mar√≠a received the land on which Weslaco is located today. The Ball√≠ family ranched and maintained ownership of the land until 1852. In 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway made its way to the site. It was promoted by Uriah Lott, Lon C. Hill, Jr., and others interested in developing the area through farming as opposed to ranching. The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company of neighboring Mercedes purchased a major portion of the Llano Grande grant and platted the West Tract in 1913. In an effort to control raids from Mexico, the United States government stationed troops along the Rio Grande in 1916. A camp was established at the Llano Grande railroad depot. This camp was located between Mercedes and the current site of Weslaco. A watchtower was constructed at Progreso by these troops. On December 14, 1917, the irrigation company sold at ninety dollars an acre to the W. E. Stewart Land Company. The town name \\"Weslaco\\" was derived from the company's name. The Stewart Company later sold the townsite to Ed C. Couch, Dan R. Couch, R. C. Couch, and R. L. Reeves. The site was surveyed and platted on September 18, 1919, by H. E. Bennett, a civil engineer hired by Ed Couch and R. L. Reeves, whose partners, fearing failure, had backed out of the venture. Nearby communities circulated flyers discouraging settlement at the proposed town. Nevertheless, the sale of lots was held on December 8‚Äì10, 1919. Prices ranged from $50 to $400 per lot. To make a claim, individuals had to choose a lot and camp on it until the day of the sale. Lots were given away free to church groups. Three cars were also given away as a promotion during the sale.\\"TSHA Texas State Historical Association, Weslaco, TX.\\" Texas State Historical Association. Retrieved on November 1, 2015.

History From the Handbook of Texas Online: \\"Settlers, attracted to the site because it was the nearest point to Hillsboro where timber could be found, began moving into the area in the 1840s. The original settlement, near the site of present Aquilla, was called Mudtown. The community of Aquilla and nearby Aquilla Creek were probably named for early settler Aquilla Jones. The town received a post office in 1859. Twenty years later the tracks of the Texas Central Railroad crossed southwestern Hill County, passing within a few miles of the timber settlement. Shortly thereafter, businesses and residents moved a few miles south to the rail line. The community's population was 175 in 1886 and 100 in 1892. A series of illnesses resulted from drinking creek water, so a well was dug in 1897 to provide fresh water. One of the state's first chartered banks opened at Aquilla in 1905, when the town also had a health spa. In 1910 the population surpassed 200. By 1914 it had a population of over 500 and thirteen retail stores, three hotels, four churches, a school, a newspaper, a bank, and a thriving lumber company.

The town was named in honor of J.F. Anton, a Santa Fe railroad executive. Anton's first mayor was Paul Grover Whitfield, who was born in July 1908, so in 1924 was only 16 or 17 years old.

He is, therefore, on record as being the youngest mayor ever in Texas at the time, and since he was under 18, the record stands to this day and likely will for all time. Whether an election was held or if he simply volunteered for the position is unclear. In those days, identification was not required because most agreements were done with a handshake.

Several motorists driving on various highways around Levelland in the evening and early morning hours of November 2‚Äì3 claimed to see a large, egg-shaped object which emitted a blue glow and caused their automobiles to shut off. In most cases, the object was sitting either on the highway or close to it. When the object took off, witnesses claimed their vehicles would restart and work normally. Among witnesses were Weir Clem, Levelland's sheriff, and Ray Jones, the town's fire chief.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 6,950. Houston County is the oldest county and Crockett the fifth-oldest city in Texas.  History  Warfield House in Crockett The town was named after David Crockett, who reportedly had camped nearby on his way to the Alamo; the site was very near the Old San Antonio Road. A family from Tennessee donated the land for the town and named it after Crockett, whom they had previously known. The town was incorporated in 1837, and a post office was granted the following year. Crockett was connected to Nacogdoches by stage service. In 1839 raids by the Alabama-Coushatta and Cherokee Indians forced the town's residents to take shelter in the fortified log courthouse. Crockett was a training center for Confederate conscripts during the Civil War. The railroad came through in 1872, enabling Crockett to exploit the county's timber resources. By 1885 the town was thriving with a population of 1,200, and the following year a school was opened for black girls. It evolved into Mary Allen Junior College, which operated into the 1970s. In 1904 lignite mining started, peaking about 1910. The stands of timber were seriously depleted by the 1920s. The population was over 3,000 in the mid-1920s, and by 1936 it was nearly 4,500. The population of Crockett increased while most of East Texas declined after World War II. It had reached 5,000 by the 1960 census.Crockett Texas and Crockett Texas Hotels Motels During this time, one of the first loop roads in the nation (Loop 304) was built around the city. This traffic reliever was procured through the works of heavyweight politicians who called Crockett home. Blues singer Lightnin' Hopkins was once arrested in Crockett. In recent years, the economy of Crockett has expanded with the construction of new retail space on Loop 304. Several historic buildings in downtown have been renovated to accommodate new office and service space. Renewed interest in reserves of natural gas in the surrounding area has led to construction of energy infrastructure and receipt of royalty revenues for land. In 1854, A.T. Monroe, a grandnephew of U.S. President James Monroe, came to Crockett from Virginia. He established what is now the Monroe-Crook House, built with brick placed between the inner and outer walls. George W. Crook purchased the residence in 1911. The house, open for public tours, is located in front of the John H. Wooters Public Library in the same block as the Crockett Presbyterian Church.Texas Historical Commission, historical marker, Monroe-Crook House, Crockett, Texas The Presbyterian Church was established in 1854.

Edge Effects: The Border-Name Places (2nd edition, 2009), iUniverse, , page 324. Five schools have been built over the years in the community and the city of Latexo. The first Bethel school building was on a dirt road that ran parallel with the railroad tracks, about south of the railroad crossing at the north end of the city. This building was later occupied as the home of Cleveland Willis. The second Bethel school built in the community was located on a street that went east from what was at that time the main road that ran south along the railroad tracks. This site in the 1960s and later years was known as the home site of the Stokes Reed family. This building was later sold (around 1930) to the Baptist Church and was used as such for many years. The third site of the school was located about two houses east of the second site and was the location of what was referred to as the old Ed Burton home, but was the Bill McKinney home in 1961, and later the Clifford Price home.

The population was 649 at the 2010 census. History Lovelady was founded by investors of the Houston & Great Northern Railroad as a railway line was built through a land grant of Cyrus Lovelady, near the communities of Nevil's Prairie, Pennington, and Weldon. The U.S. Post Office opened on November 8, 1872. The town soon had livery, stables, blacksmith shop, and hotels, prospering as both a marketplace and a shipping point. By 1876 a public school was held in a local log house. Lovelady was incorporated in 1927. The Porter Place Ranch at Lovelady, founded in 1912 by V. H. \\"Hoyt\\" Porter, is the setting of many prized photographs by Porter's son-in-law, Guy Gillette, who spent many summers at the ranch with his wife, Doris Porter Gillette, and their two sons. In 2013, Andy Wilkinson of Lubbock published through the University of Oklahoma Press a coffee-table book, A Family of the Land: The Texas Photography of Guy Gillette, a photo-account of Gillette's career. Based on pictures that Gillette took dating back to the 1940s, the volume documents ranching, family, and small-town life, including downtown activities on Saturdays: the caf√©, drug store, barbershop, city streets, and marching band; and Sunday church activities: homecoming, dinner on the ground, and Bible school.Billy Hathorn, Review of A Family of the Land: The Texas Photography of Guy Gillette by Andy Wilkinson (Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013, 131 pp.) in West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 156-157.

With a population of 27,282 as of the 2010 census, it is the largest city between Midland to the west, Abilene to the east, Lubbock to the north, and San Angelo to the south. Big Spring was established as the county seat of Howard County in 1882; it is the largest community in the county. The city took its name from the single, large spring that issued into a small gorge between the base of Scenic Mountain and a neighboring hill in the southwestern part of the city limits. Although the name is sometimes still mistakenly pluralized, it is officially singular. \\"To the native or established residents who may wince at the plural in Big Spring, it should be explained that until about 1916, when for some unexplained reason the name dropped the final 's', the official name of the town was indeed Big Springs.\\" History Signal Peak located to the southeast of Big Spring (Robert T.

Big Spring decorative sign The \\"big spring\\" in Comanche Trail Park Big Spring City Hall Newly refurbished Settles Hotel Big Spring Veterans Hospital The area had long been a popular watering hole for Native American residents and nomads, including members of the more recently established Jumano, Apache, and Comanche tribes. The first European to view the site was probably a member of a Spanish expedition exploring the Great Plains from New Mexico. During the 1840s and 1850s Big Spring was often where Comanches assembled and organized themselves before departing on large-scale raids into northern Mexico during the Comanche-Mexico Wars.Smith, Ralph A. (1985-1986), \\"The Comanches' Foreign War: Fighting Head Hunters in the Tropics,\\" Great Plains Journal, Vol. 24-25, p. 21 Captain Randolph B. Marcy's expedition in 1849 was the first United States expedition to explore and map the area.Marcy, R.B. 1850. \\"Report of Captain R.B. Marcy's route from Fort Smith to Santa Fe.\\" In: Reports of the Secretary of War, Executive Document 64, Washington, D.C., pp. 169‚Äì233. (See p. 208) Marcy marked the spring as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The site began to collect inhabitants, and by the late 1870s a settlement had sprung up to support buffalo hunters who frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and saloons. Ranching quickly became a major industry in the area; early ranchers included F.G. Oxsheer, C.C. Slaughter, and B.F. Wolcott. One notable early rancher was Briton Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased of ranchland in the area in 1883, and is credited with building Big Spring's first permanent structure, a butcher's shop. The completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early 1880s of Abilene, Colorado City, and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching cities where saloons and gambling dens flourished. More important in the city's history was the discovery of oil in the region during the 1920s. The early discoveries in the area marked the beginning of the oil industry in the Permian Basin area of West Texas, and the oil industry has continued to be a dominant part of the area's economy. The oil industry in Big Spring reached its peak during the oil boom of the 1950s. Another major part of Big Spring's economy and life during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was Webb Air Force Base. It initially opened during World War II as the Big Spring Bombardier School. Following the war, it was converted to a US Air Force training base and was named for James Webb, a Big Spring native who died in action during World War II. Webb Air Force Base was active until 1977, when the base facilities were deeded to the city. Big Spring was featured in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy, which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, and received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1969. The opening scenes featuring Voight, then a relatively unknown actor, playing the character Joe Buck, were filmed in Big Spring and the neighboring city of Stanton. In 1980, Hollywood returned to Big Spring with the filming of Hangar 18, a low-budget science-fiction movie about a space shuttle's collision with an alien spacecraft and the ensuing government cover-up. Several local residents were used as on-screen extras. Big Spring is the location for the opening scene of the Robert Rodriguez film From Dusk Till Dawn. In 1999, a New York energy company erected the first 80-meter tower for one of North America's largest wind turbines for that time at Big Spring.\\"Turbine timeline: The History of AWEA and the U.S. Wind Industry: 1990s.\\" American Wind Energy Association.

Origin of the name \\"Big Spring\\" The area's \\"big spring\\", long dry but recently modified to draw water from Comanche Trail Lake, was of major importance to all life in the surrounding area. In the early 1840s, it was the center of a territorial dispute between Comanche and Pawnee tribes, and has been a major watering hole for wildlife and prehistoric people in this semiarid area.Brune, G. 1981. Springs of Texas. Vol. I, Fort Worth: Branch Smith, p. 235 Early military scouting reports and pioneer accounts describe the water as cold, clear, and dependable; the spring pool was about deep, with the overflow going only a short distance down the draw before it sank beneath the surface. The spring has mistakenly been described in other writings as being located in Sulphur Draw. It is actually located to the south, near the top of a small, rugged, unnamed draw running eastwards from the spring, and is itself a tributary to Beal's Creek, the name given to Sulphur Draw as it flows into, through, and past the city of Big Spring. Long used by regional inhabitants, both permanent and nomadic, with a large number of locally collected artifacts testifying to its heavy occupation, the spring sat astride the several branches of the later-developed Comanche War Trail as they converged on this important water hole from beyond Texas, coming south across the Northern Plains and the Llano Estacado. From the Big Spring, the war trail continued south via three branches, one to the southeast through the western part of the Concho country; one going almost due south, heading for Castle Gap and Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River; and one heading west to Willow Springs in the sand country southwest of present Midland, before turning south down the Pecos, all headed ultimately for Mexico. As whites began to settle the western territories, the spring continued to serve as a major watering place on the southern route of the Gold Rush Trail of the early 1850s and continued in use well beyond that time, as the cross-continental trail turned into a major road for later pioneers coming into the area. The spring was sourced from a relatively small aquifer situated on the northern end of the Edwards Plateau and the southern end of the High Plains, being, structurally, a collecting sink of lower Cretaceous (Fredericksburg) limestones and sands. The spring aquifer held a large quantity of water due to the great number of fractures, solution channels, and interstices in the rocks and underlying sands, although the areal extent of the Big Spring sink is estimated to be only in diameter, with the main area only wide and almost circular, with some ellipticity trending towards the west. The Cretaceous beds subsided about below their normal position, centered on the southeast quarter of Section 12, Block 33 T1S; T&P; RR Co survey, and the entire stratum appears to be preserved within the sink, the surface topography roughly following the subsurface subsidence. This writing identifies the sink as one of a number of similar subsurface geologic features in the surrounding area, differing from the Big Spring sink only in the fact that the surface topography above the others, while showing some decline, does not dip low enough to intersect the top of the water tables; hence, no springs could form from the other aquifers. In a passing comment, enigmatic in its content and disappointing in its brevity, the report states no other comparable deep sinks formed elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau. The same publication suggests the spring's discharge volume was in excess of per day at the time of the railroad's arrival in the area in the late 1880s. The water was heavily mined by wells built by both the railroad and the early town of Big Spring, greatly in excess of its modest recharge rate, until the water table first dropped below the level of the spring outlet, and, finally, was completely depleted by the mid-1920s. The city now artificially fills the spring from its current source of water as a means of allowing residents and visitors to maintain some idea of how it appeared in times past.

Oil companies began leasing local land and production from the first oil well began on November 9, 1925. On May 28, 1928, a town site on the ranch of Clayton Stewart was placed on the market. An office was set up and lots were sold at twenty- five dollars each. By December 1928, the growing community was known as Forsan. The name was derived from the fact that four paying oil sands were believed to be present in the area. Drillers would later discover that there were actually at least five sands present. A school and several businesses opened soon after. On March 5, 1929, Forsan's post office began operating. A true oil boomtown, Forsan's population had already reached 350 by 1931. The Great Depression's impact on Forsan wasn't as significant as in other rural Texas towns. The population grew to 400 by 1936.

The population was 1,750 at the 2010 census. Fort Hancock is situated on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, across from El Porvenir, Chihuahua. The Fort Hancock‚ÄìEl Porvenir International Bridge connects the two communities, and the Fort Hancock Port of Entry is located on the Texas side. Texas State Highway 20 and the Union Pacific Railroad run through the town. History= Camp Rice and Fort Hancock  Fort Hancock began as a military establishment named Camp Rice in 1882, along the San Antonio-El Paso Road. Camp Rice had formerly been located at Fort Quitman, and had been established by troops of the 10th U.S. Cavalry \\"buffalo soldiers\\". Camp Rice did not grow after moving to this community, and rarely hosted more than 60 men. It was renamed Fort Hancock in 1886 after the death of General Winfield Scott Hancock, a hero of the Battle of Gettysburg. The fort was damaged in a flood that year, but rebuilt. It was damaged again by fires in 1889, then abandoned in 1895.Handbook of Texas Online, Bruce J. Dinges, \\"Fort Hancock,\\" accessed July 28, 2016, https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbf24. The remains of the old fort are located in a cotton field about west of present-day Fort Hancock.  Town of Fort Hancock  A post office was established in 1886, with Albert Warren as postmaster. In 1887, a new railroad depot was built at Fort Hancock, and by 1890, a town had grown up around it and had a population of 200, a general store, a hotel, and a meat market. By 1914, the population of the town had dropped to 50, though by 1940, it had increased to 500. Federal troops were sent to Fort Hancock in 1918 to contain Mexican \\"bandits and outlaws\\" operating along the border. The bandits were suspected of being directed by German agents. In 1995, a 13-year-old boy \\"trying to get toys for Christmas\\" fired three rifle shots at a semitrailer traveling along nearby Interstate 10, hoping to blow out a tire so the truck would spill its load. He instead hit the driver of a pickup truck, critically wounding him. Officials in Fort Hancock raised the speed limit to in 2006 along their portion of Interstate 10, making it the highest speed limit in the country. In 2006, CNN did a feature story about Fort Hancock, highlighting the close relationship between families living on the US and Mexican sides of the border. In the introduction, it described how \\"illegal immigrants risk their lives to cross the border, but not in Fort Hancock, Texas. A casual stroll across the foot bridge gets you in there.\\" In an interview with Hudspeth County Deputy Sheriff Mike Doyal, he described the border as \\"just an open footway traffic for people coming across\\", and showed one of the four unguarded foot bridges that connect Fort Hancock to Mexico. Doyal spoke fondly of his Mexican neighbors, saying \\"those are not the people that we have a problem with, because I'm going to make it real clear that some of those people on the other side are some of the nicest people you would ever want to meet in your life.\\" CNN described Fort Hancock as \\"a timeless place\\", adding, \\"for people who live here, the border barely exists. We found these Mexican cattle ranchers moving their herd along the river. A few times the cows [sic] would move into the U.S., the buckaroos rode across the dried-out river and collected their animals.\\" The quiescent community described by CNN in 2006 had changed significantly by 2010, when residents became increasingly concerned that violence associated with the Mexican drug trade would spill across the border. In one instance, Deputy Sheriff Doyal announced to townspeople: \\"We just got word that the cartel has threatened to kill children in schools across the border unless parents paid 5000 pesos.\\" The town's sheriff, Arvin West, cautioned farmers to arm themselves. The newly erected Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier is not a continuous wall, but rather a segmented one, at places no more than a fence. This has led many unauthorized migrants to traverse the barrier on the Mexican side in search of a break; breaks are often in remote desert areas like Fort Hancock. This \\"funnel effect\\" has contributed to the deaths of thousands of unauthorized migrants, who are frequently found dead in the hot Texas sun. Journalist Joseph J. Kolb interviewed local rancher Lupe Dempsey, who described how \\"on her doorstep was a 25-year-old man named Juan who, thirsty and disoriented, told how he'd become lost after illegally crossing the border and had wandered the desert in 110-degree heat.\\" Kolb added, \\"His story was not unique to Dempsey and others in this West Texas town, where the 18-foot-high U.S. border fence ends abruptly, giving way to a few strands of barbed wire.\\" Geography The Fort Hancock CDP is in southwestern Hudspeth County, bordered to the southwest by the Rio Grande and to the northeast by Interstate 10, with access from exits 68, 72, and 78.

History The city of Quinlan began about 1892 as a stop on the Texas Midland Railroad, which was owned by famed bond investor Hetty Green, called by the contemporary press \\"The Witch of Wall Street\\". The railroad was operated by her son, Edward H.R. Green. Texas Midland became a subsidiary of the Houston & Texas Central Railroad, and the city which built up around a depot constructed here between the towns of Roberts and Greenville was named Quinlan in honor of George A. Quinlan, the general manager of the Houston & Texas Central railroad. The Post Office opened in Quinlan in 1894, and by 1896 the city was incorporated. Harry Ford served as first Mayor. Quinlan soon became the center of a large agricultural area. Providing a railroad shipping point for growers of cotton and other crops. By the early 20th century the town boasted three cotton gins, numerous businesses and fraternal organizations, banks, schools, churches and homes. Oil exploration and production overtook cotton farming as the area's economic base in the 1930s and 1940s, and the construction of Lake Tawakoni in the 1950s brought another economic boost to the community. (Texas Historical Commission) Some of the earliest settlers were John M. Cook and R. K. Epperson, who moved their businesses from Roberts. The settlement received a post office in 1894, and by 1900 its population had reached 362.

The population was 13,251 at the 2010 census. Borger is named for businessman Asa Philip \\"Ace\\" Borger, who also established the Hutchinson County seat of Stinnett and several other small towns in Texas and Oklahoma.  History  The first Panhandle oil well was drilled in the Borger area on May 2, 1921, on the 6666 (the \\"Four Sixes\\") Ranch of S.B. Burnett. The strike was of a poor quality, and later wells in Borger and Pampa spurred the petroleum boom. The first rotary drilling rig, built at the then-staggering price of $25,000, was placed into use near Borger by W.T. Willis, J.E. Trigg, and H.D. Lewis. The drill could pierce through rock.Texas Historical Commission, historical markers, State Highway 207 south of Borger, 1993 Ace Borger and his business partner John R. Miller purchased a townsite near the Canadian River in March 1926 after the discovery of oil in the vicinity. Within a few months, the boomtown had swollen to a population of 45,000, most lured by sensational advertising and \\"black gold\\". In October 1926, the city charter was adopted, and Miller was elected mayor. By this time, the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railway had completed the spur line to Borger, a post office had opened, and a school district was established. The boomtown of Borger soon had steam-generated electricity, telephone service, a hotel, and a jail. Regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton depicted this period of Borger in his large painting Boomtown.Boomtown In the months that followed, oilmen, roughnecks, prospectors, panhandlers, and fortune seekers were joined by cardsharks, prostitutes, bootleggers, and drug dealers. The city became known as \\"Booger Town\\", as it attracted criminals and fugitives from the law. The town government soon fell under control of an organized crime syndicate led by Mayor Miller's shady associate, \\"Two-Gun Dick\\" Herwig. Dixon Street (now Tenth Street) was the \\"red-light\\" district, housing brothels, dance halls, speakeasies, and gambling dens. Murder and robbery became an everyday occurrence, and illegal moonshining and home brewing flourished under the fatherly watch of Herwig and his henchmen, including W. J. (Shine) Popejoy, the king of the Texas bootleggers. Borger became so notorious that in the spring of 1927, Texas Governor Dan Moody sent a force of Texas Rangers to rein in the town. The Texas Rangers were led by Captains Frank Hamer and Thomas R. Hickman. (Hamer would go on to later fame and even infamy as the man who killed Bonnie and Clyde.) The Rangers did have a stabilizing effect, but Borger still struggled with lawlessness and violence into the 1930s, climaxing with the murder of District Attorney John A. Holmes by an assassin on September 18, 1929. This event caused Governor Moody to impose martial law for a month and send in state troops to help rid the town of its criminal element. Eventually, Borger settled down, but not before town founder Ace Borger was shot and killed at the post office by Arthur Huey on August 31, 1934. Huey was county treasurer and was irked at Ace Borger for not bailing him out of jail on an embezzlement charge. Huey shot Borger five times with a Colt .45 pistol, even pulling Borger's own pistol out of his clothing and shooting him again, along with others there in the post office. By the late 1930s, Borger was pushed from one era to another by the Great Depression. Phillips Petroleum and others profited from the oil fields in the area, but during this time, the price of oil and gas dropped, ending the \\"boom\\" and the rapid growth of Borger. Carbon black plants added black soot to the Dust Bowl storms, covering the town in layers of dark grime. \\"Okie\\" migrants forced off their foreclosed farms back in Oklahoma found work in Borger plants and refineries. The Works Project Administration provided the town with new red-brick streets as the ramshackle shacks throughout town were replaced by more permanent buildings. During World War II, synthetic rubber and other petroleum products became important in the Borger area. By the 1960s, the Borger area was one of the largest producers of oil, carbon black, and petrochemicals and supplies in the state. The creation of nearby Lake Meredith also added to the town's economy as an important recreational area. Today, Borger remains an important shipping point for agricultural produce, as well as for the petroleum products produced there. It is the home of the world's largest inland petrochemical complexes. Chevron-Phillips Chemical Company produces specialty chemicals. Solvay produces RYTON PPS plastics. Phillips 66 Petroleum Company processes crude oil and natural gas liquids. Agrium manufactures nitrogen fertilizer in its Borger plant. Borger also has Sid Richardson Carbon Company, which produces rubber- grade carbon black used to strengthen rubber tires, and Orion Engineered Carbons, Inc., which produces a variety of carbon blacks at its Borger facility. The original townsite is said to have been founded around 1898 by John F. Weatherly, a rancher who built a dugout and gave the future town the grandiose name of Granada. Weatherly's wife wanted it named after her former home ‚Äì a town in West Virginia called Isom. In 1900, Weatherly opened a store in his ranchhouse, which also became the first post office. Mrs. Weatherly opened a caf√© and the community had a school opened by 1907. In October 1919, the mail was diverted through Plemons and the Isom post office closed. The Hutchinson County Historical Museum, also known as Boomtown Revisited, is located in downtown Borger. The Weatherlys lost interest in the town they founded and moved to the nearby town of Panhandle in 1922, but they wisely retained ownership of all that was Isom. When oil was discovered in early 1926, Weatherly returned and moved the town to the oilfield spur of the railroad near Borger. Isom was platted with all lots south of First Street being Isom, Texas, and all streets north in Borger. From June to December 1926, the towns were rivals. Although the town had a railroad depot, several oil-well supply warehouses, and no shortage of would-be citizens, a petition signed by 1,200 residents in early December declared Borger the winner. Isom's school merged with Borger's schools, driving the last stake into Isom. The town has the dubious distinction of being the oldest of the townsites annexed by Borger.Isom Texas, Texas Panhandle Ghost Town. TexasEscapes.com. During the winter of 1982‚Äì1983, Borger received a total of 58.7 inches of snow. This is the most snow that any Texas town has ever received during a winter season. Politics Borger and Hutchinson County are among the strongest Republican voting districts in Texas and the nation, having cast GOP ballots at the presidential level in all elections for more than a half century. Even Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, who was swamped nationally and in Texas by native son Lyndon B. Johnson, won Hutchinson County, 5,358 to 4,625. In 1984, Ronald W. Reagan carried 9,078 votes in Hutchinson County to only 2,052 for the Democrat Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota. In 1996, Robert J. Dole of Kansas polled 6,350 votes in Hutchinson County to 2,553 for incumbent President Bill Clinton. H. Ross Perot, the Dallas industrialist, received 864 votes. The only Democrat since Lyndon Johnson to exceed 3,600 votes in Hutchinson County was Jimmy Carter in 1976, but Gerald R. Ford handily defeated him in the county.World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1969, pp. 909‚Äì910; 1977, pp. 65‚Äì66; 1985, pp. 65‚Äì66; 1993, pp. 100‚Äì101: In the 2008 presidential primaries, Hutchinson County cast 3,170 votes in the Republican race and 1,538 in the Democratic contest.

Although oil had been discovered in Jack County as early as 1898, it wasn't until the mid-1920s that Bryson became an oil processing center for local producers.

The population was 5,499 at the 2010 census. Edna is the county seat. Edna is the gateway to Lake Texana, which covers the site of Texana, Texas. Edna has a hospital, convalescent home, library, museum, city park with swimming pool, three banks, two savings and loan associations, a country club with a nine- hole golf course, and Oak Creek Village, a retirement community. It is the center of a prosperous agricultural area with petroleum and natural gas production and has an active chamber of commerce, oilfield service industries, and two grain elevators. On the courthouse lawn is a monument to Irwin Moore Laughter (1893 - 1916) of the United States Navy, who was killed in Mazatlan, Mexico, during the attempt by U.S. forces to capture the Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa.Laughter monument, Jackson County Courthouse, Edna, Texas History Edna, the county seat of Jackson County, was established in 1882 when the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway line was built from Rosenberg to Victoria and bypassed Texana, then the county seat. Construction of the railroad began in September 1881. Edna was laid out on land owned by Mrs. Lucy Flournoy, who conveyed right-of-way and a half interest in the townsite to the railroad, which was promoted and built by Italian Count Joseph Telfener. The town was named for a daughter of the count. The NYT&M;, nicknamed the \\"Macaroni\\", was constructed by Italian laborers, most of whom were brought from Lombardy by Telfener. After completion of the road, the majority of the crew remained in the area and established homes. The first train arrived on July 4, 1882; the first merchant was Gideon Egg, who moved his general merchandise store from Texana in 1882, and the first child born in the new community was Edna Louise Traylor. In an election of January 22, 1883, residents voted to make Edna the county seat in place of Texana. The contract for a new courthouse was awarded on February 11, 1884. A post office opened in 1886. The first church congregations in Edna were the Methodist and Presbyterian, whose memberships moved from Texana almost intact. The latter brought their 1859 sanctuary with them overland. The building was also used by other denominations for worship services and is now the oldest public building remaining in the county. The Texana Presbyterian Church has been restored and serves in Edna as an area cultural center. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The first newspaper in Edna was the Jackson County Progress. The newspaper plant, along with a large part of the business district, was destroyed in 1906 in the town's second disastrous fire. Succeeding the Progress was the Edna Herald, first published on November 22, 1906. The 1954 Supreme Court case Hernandez v. Texas concerned the racial context of the jury selection for a trial that took place in Edna. The landmark decision of the case determined that Mexican Americans and all other racial groups in the United States had equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

History The City of Ganado was a ranching community when it was first settled. Most settlers lived near Mustang Creek and traveled to Texana, Victoria and Indianola for supplies. Jackson County's \\"second city,\\" Ganado was originally known as Mustang Settlement, after nearby Mustang Creek. Cattle ranching was the primary economic engine and herds were driven to Louisiana for sale and later to Kansas City. That came to an abrupt end with the coming of the railroad in 1882. As the story goes, a railroad official looked out the window of a train car and saw a large herd of cattle. He decided the area should be called Ganado, which means \\"herd\\" in Spanish. Thus Ganado was named in 1882. Scandinavian immigrants bought land and began farming in 1891. A second wave of immigration brought Germans and Bohemians in the 1880s and 1890s. Jim McFarland moved his general store from its earlier location on McFarland Creek to a site in town. After McFarland died, Thomas Babcock-who was also the town's first postmaster, bought the remaining stock and continued a store in the building. Babcock's establishment, later known as the Old Texas House, provided supplies to local ranchers. Soon afterwards, Babcock also established the first residence and first cotton gin in Ganado. In 1891 T. N. Mauritz opened the first bank in Ganado. By 1909 the town had sixty businesses. When the railroad was built through, Ganado grew almost overnight into a bustling city. New homes, hotels, and businesses sprang up quickly. The city incorporated in 1909. By 1914 the town was thriving with a rice mill and storage facilities, 750 citizens, a school district and a weekly newspaper. By 1937, Main Street was paved, concrete sidewalks were added and water lines were installed. By 1950 the population had increased to 1,253. The Little School of the 400 was created in 1957 to meet the educational needs of Spanish speaking children in Texas who were being discriminated against for their lack of knowledge of the English language. The goal of the program was to teach 400 basic English words to help Spanish-speaking children to manage instruction given in English in the regular public educational system.ed.gov Under the leadership of Felix Tijerina, LULAC Council 60, of Houston, Texas, chose Ganado to be its first community to pilot the program. The program went on to become very successful and the state of Texas adopted it as their own. It later became a precursor to the national Head Start Program.http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html In 1963, a municipal bond was overwhelmingly approved for $60,000. This bond would be separated into two parts: $44,000 for a new city hall and $16,000 for new fire truck and equipment. The Council at that time were Mayor W.W. Brandes, Councilmen Dr. C.L. Bishop and J.B. Housson. The open house for new building was on May 3, 1964. In 1988 forty-three businesses served 1,770 citizens.

History The Jasper County Courthouse 19th century The area, which was then part of Mexican Texas, was settled around 1824 by John Bevil. Thirty families occupied the settlement as early as 1830, when it was known as \\"Snow River\\", after John R. Bevil, a hero of the American Revolution. In 1835, the town was renamed after William Jasper, a war hero from the American Revolution, who was killed attempting to plant the American flag at the storming of Savannah in 1779.TSHA Online ‚Äì Texas State Historical Association Jasper was one of the 23 original counties when the Republic of Texas was created in 1836. Jasper became the county seat in 1844 and became part of the United States with the annexation of Texas in 1845. During the Civil War, the town housed a Confederate quartermaster depot and served as a major center for Confederate communication, transportation, and supply. Jasper was a Confederate Army headquarters for a nine-county area. Following the war, Union troops led by General George Custer occupied Jasper, camping in the town square. Educational institutions included the Jasper Male and Female High School, which operated until 1878, when it became the Southeast Texas Male and Female College, and Jasper Collegiate Institute, which operated from 1851 until 1874. The population declined to 360 in 1870, reflecting the hardships of the Civil War, but by 1885 had risen to 1,000. In 1896, Jasper had a population of 1,200. With the arrival of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway early in the 20th century, Jasper grew into a center for the manufacture of timber products. Lumber from two sawmills, with a daily capacity of 125,000 board feet (295 m¬≥), goods from basket and stave factories, logs, ties, poles, and pulpwood were shipped in 200 cars per month. 20th century In 1901, the town of Jasper was robbed. The post office safe and the county treasurer's safe were blown and robbed. The thieves set a fire, and as the town had no fire department, the entire town was completely destroyed. Damages were estimated at $100,000. What was stolen from the safes was unknown. The thieves escaped. Jasper served as headquarters for the Lower Neches Valley Authority's construction program, including Dam \\"B\\" at Town Bluff and engineering and surveying for a dam at Magee Bend on the Angelina River. Local farmers raised broiler chickens and beef, and in the 1950s turned to dairying. Jasper also became the headquarters of the Morgan and Lindsey chain of variety stores (otherwise known as dimestores), which at one time operated 85 outlets in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In June 1998, the murder of James Byrd Jr. catapulted Jasper into national news and led to the creation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Three men‚ÄîJohn William King, Lawrence Russell Brewer, and Shawn Berry‚Äîwere tried and convicted of capital murder. King and Brewer received the death penalty, while Berry, who was the only suspect who cooperated during the investigation and implicated King and Brewer, was sentenced to life in prison.

History  China was first known as \\"China Grove\\", for a water stop for the Texas and New Orleans Railroad that sat amidst a grove of chinaberry trees. In the 1860s a small community grew around the water stop, and another a few miles away named Nashland. A post office with the name \\"China\\" was established there in 1893. When fire destroyed the China Grove depot in 1906, the railroad rebuilt in the larger Nashland area, but retained the established name \\"China\\" as the name of the depot. The Nashland post office changed its name to China shortly afterward. It wasn't until 1971 that the (now-merged) community voted to incorporate as the city of China, Texas. During World War II, a small branch camp was built for German prisoners of war who were detailed to China from the larger Camp Huntsville in Walker County, Texas (now a part of Sam Houston State University). These prisoners helped to maintain rice fields while local farmers were serving in the military.Krammer, Arnold. Nazi Prisoners of War in America (New York: Stein and Day, 1979) The chinaberry trees that gave the community its name are rare in the area today. In fact, two trees that were transplanted to the front lawn of the city's civic complex in the mid 1990s are some of the only remaining examples. However, several local China and Meeker natives have taken to cultivating and nurturing new and transplanted chinaberry trees. In 1999, Disney celebrated the video release of Mulan in China, TX. They built a miniature version of the Great Wall of China on what used to be Henderson Middle School (Now China Elementary School) football field. They had all sorts of games and showings of the animated feature film in the school's library. For years, China Elementary hosted an annual Chinaberry Festival, to celebrate the city's people and history. The festival featured a parade, local country musicians, and many booths fielded by local vendors and church groups. However the elementary school has not hosted the festival since the destruction of Hurricane Rita in 2005. Instead the City of China has attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to reinstate the festival. In 2011, the festival only had 6 booths and barely 100 attendees. In 2004, former Mayor Hermann Edwards pleaded guilty to tampering with governmental records and was sentenced to a year of probation.

History  Grigsby's Bluff Jail, Port Neches The area known as Port Neches was once inhabited by tribes of the coastal-dwelling Karankawa and Atakapa Native Americans. Smith's Bluff (the future site of Sun Oil and Union Oil of California riverside property) and Grigsby's Bluff (now Port Neches) were the only two high land bluffs on the Neches River south of Beaumont. Before 1780, Grigsby's Bluff, specifically that part of Port Neches immediately east of Port Neches Park, had been a Native American town for at least 1,500 years, at first of the Karankawa tribe, whose skeletons were often found in the burial mounds there; and after 1650 of the Nacazils, a sub-tribe of the Attakapas, who were a short and stocky people before their extinction about 1780. As of 1841, there were six large burial mounds at Grigsby's Bluff, size about wide, tall, and long, consisting entirely of clam and sea shells, skeletons, pottery shards, and other Native American artifacts. Between 1841 and 1901, all six of the mounds disappeared, a result of human actions. Grigsby's Bluff became a post office in 1859 (there was also a store and sawmill there), but the office was discontinued in 1893. Port Neches was the site of Fort Grigsby, a set of Civil War-era defenses intended to stop a Union advance up the Neches River. The fort was constructed in October 1862 and abandoned sometime after July 1863. Its guns, munitions, and stores were moved to the then-unfinished Fort Griffin, the site of the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, often credited as the most one-sided Confederate victory of the American Civil War. A pioneer of Port Neches was Will Block, Sr., born on August 2, 1870. In 2003 his son, W. T. Block Jr., was appointed a Knight of the Royal Order of Orange-Nassau for his work in reconstructing the history of Dutch settlers in the area.Christine Rappleye. \\"That's 'Sir' W.T. Block to you guys\\". The Beaumont Enterprise. May 29, 2003. The city of Port Neches was incorporated in 1902. Through its history, Port Neches has had a special relationship with the natural environment, particularly the Neches River. From agriculture and timber to oil and synthetics, the city has depended heavily on the river as its lifeline. Today, the greater Neches River Basin is an international attraction for \\"experiential\\" tourism; whether that be fishing, hunting, birding, boating or many other out-door experiences that are abundant and readily available. The Oak Bluff cemetery, located near the river, is the burial site of famed country music singer and actor Tex Ritter. TPC Group's Port Arthur Refinery, a chemical processing facility, was opened in 1944 by Neches Butane Products Co. On November 27, 2019, two explosions occurred at the plant injuring at least eight people, three of them plant workers who were treated in hospital. Several buildings, including homes, were damaged in Port Neches and the surrounding area. The blasts started a chemical fire that prompted a mandatory evacuation of approximately 60,000 residents from several nearby cities. The fire was finally put out on December 3 after burning for six days. The next day air monitors posted elevated levels of butadiene, prompting a second evacuation. The explosions occurred just days after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) eased chemical plant safety regulations.

Origin Hebbronville is located on land which once formed part of Las Noriecitas, one of the earliest ranches founded in the area. The town's namesake, James Richard Hebbron, acquired land, in about 1880, from the descendants of the original grantee, Ignacio Benavides. With two others, he bought , in what was then Duval County, just above Pe√±a. One of his sons, Arthur Hebbron, came down from California and took charge of running his ranch. Hebbronville itself was created in 1883, when the Texas-Mexican Railway Company built a railroad through the area. Francisco P. Pe√±a, operator of Pe√±a Station on this route, refused to sell any land to the Texas-Mexican for a townsite. The company then approached J. R. Hebbron, who arranged for the sale of land for the new townsite, near Pe√±itas. The old train station at Pe√±itas was then loaded onto a flatcar, moved 1¬Ω miles west and named Hebbronville. For a time, Hebbronville ranked as the largest cattle-shipping center in the country, and it continues to be a hub of ranching activity. A photograph of James R. Hebbron hangs in the Jim Hogg County Courthouse at 102 East Tilley Street in Hebbronville. He was born in London, England, but spent most of his adult life in California, mainly around Salinas.

The population was 19,104 at the 2010 census. Alice was established in 1888. First it was called \\"Bandana\\", then \\"Kleberg\\", and finally \\"Alice\\" after Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg, the daughter of Richard King, who established the King Ranch. History Alice originated from the defunct community of Collins, to the east. Circa 1880, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway attempted to build a line through Collins, which then had approximately 2,000 inhabitants. The townspeople were not amenable to selling their land to the railroad company; consequently, the railroad site was moved 3 miles west, and in 1883, a depot called \\"Bandana\\" was established at its junction with the Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande Railway. Bandana soon became a thriving cattle-shipping point, and an application for a post office was made under the name \\"Kleberg\\" in honor of Robert Justus Kleberg, a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto. The petition was denied because a town named Kleberg already appeared on the post office list, so residents then chose the name \\"Alice\\", in honor of Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg, Kleberg's wife and the daughter of Richard and Henrietta King. The Alice post office opened for business in 1888. Within a few years, the remaining residents of Collins moved to Alice, which was by then a thriving community. Alice was known for its large cattle industry until the discovery of petroleum beneath and around the town in the 1940s, which caused a slight population boom. In the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas, an incident (Box 13 scandal) involving Lyndon B. Johnson's bid for the U.S. Senate took place at Alice's Precinct 13, where 202 ballots were cast in alphabetical order and all just at the close of polling in favor of Johnson. Johnson won the election against Coke Stevenson by 87 votes. Culture Alice has long been recognized as the \\"Birthplace of Tejano Music\\", dating back to the mid-1940s, when Armando Marroquin, Sr., of Alice and partner Paco Betancourt of San Benito launched what was to be the first home-based recording company to record Tejano artists exclusively. Ideal Records, which was based in Alice, under the direction of Marroquin became the perfect vehicle for Tejano groups and artists to get their music to the public. Marroquin, who also owned and operated a jukebox company, ensured that Ideal recordings would be distributed throughout South Texas. The songs recorded, which were contributed by Tejano and Mexican composers, became very popular through jukeboxes placed in restaurants, cantinas, or other establishments that would have them, and the then-scarce Spanish-language radio programs. In addition to Ideal, Alice was the home of Freddie Records and Hacienda Records, which were dominant players in Tejano music in the 1970s and 1980s. Alice is the birthplace of two Nobel Prize winners. Robert F. Curl Jr. was honored with a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996, and James P. Allison won a Nobel for his work in medicine in 2018.

Orange Grove The BRAC decision to close Naval Air Station Chase Field near Beeville led to an increase in Pilot Training Rate (PTR) and the physical number of aircraft stationed at NAS Kingsville in Kleberg County. Currently 70 T-45 trainer aircraft have arrived. In recognition of the increased congestion at Kingsville, the Navy made a significant investment in improving the facilities and capabilities of the Auxiliary Landing Field (ALF) at Orange Grove, about southwest of town. The terminal airspace at Kingsville was expanded to include Orange Grove, and the ALF serves as an overflow relief from the primary airfield. Hunting and fishing at NALF Orange Grove and Escondido Ranch is authorized in accordance with station directives and state and federal laws. Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville's gesture is a great example of how the United States Navy gives a hoot.

The population was 2,653 at the 2010 census. Geography Premont is located at (27.358064, -98.125766). It is situated at along U.S. Highway 281 (Future Interstate 69C) in south central Jim Wells County, south of Alice and north of Falfurrias, two towns that Morgan Smith of the Texas Tribune refers to as \\"relative hubs\\".Smith, Morgan. \\"Premont ISD Still Has Work to Do After Cutting Sports.\\" Texas Tribune. April 8, 2012. Retrieved on September 19, 2012. According to the United States Census Bureau, Premont has a total area of , all of it land. History The site was part of the Los Olmos y Loma Blanca land grant issues to Ignacio de la Pe√±a on December 9, 1831. Pe√±a and his heirs occupied the land for the next thirty years. On November 1, 1907, banker and real estate developer R.P. Halderman purchased a plot of land from the heirs of Henry Seeligson for $540,939.50. He then subdivided the land into tracts to entice residents from the northern U.S to invest in South Texas, citing the region's warm climate and ideal planting conditions. In 1908 or 1909, a town site was surveyed by C.F.H. Von Bulcher. Halderman named the new community \\"Premont\\", after Seeligson Ranch foreman Charles Premont. A section of the community, located east of the railroad, was set aside for Mexican and Mexican-American families. A plaza called Hidalgo Park was designed and built to serve those families. R.P. Halderman sold hundreds of lots to Charles Premont, who in turn served as the real estate agent for the Mexican families, as he was fluent in Spanish. He also donated the funds to build Santa Theresa Catholic Church, a Roman Catholic institution that now ministers to three missions. Several businesses, including a post office and a general store owned by Andr√©s Canales, opened in the community during its early years. Premont became part of the newly organized Jim Wells County on March 11, 1911. In an election held on May 6, 1911, Charles Premont was elected as the county's first commissioner. By 1912, Premont had ten businesses and an estimated population of 800. That figure had risen to approximately 1,000 by 1914, the same year that the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway built a stop at Premont. The Premont Independent School District was created in 1921. At the time of its creation, Premont ISD was the largest school district in Jim Wells County. Premont's population had declined to roughly 600 by 1925. The discovery of oil in the area during the early 1930s caused the community to grow substantially. On May 12, 1933, Premont's first producing oil well was drilled. The community incorporated in 1939 and had a population of 1,080 in 1940. With its revitalized and oil-based economy, Premont continued to grow and prosper during the early post-war years. The town was home to 2,619 residents in 1950 and had a total of 55 businesses in 1952. In 1955, American Legion Post No. 297 was dedicated in Premont.

The population was 5,910 at the 2010 census and an estimated 7,887 in 2018. Geography Joshua is located in north-central Johnson County at (32.455198, -97.393622). It is bordered to the north by Burleson and to the south by Cleburne, the county seat. Texas State Highway 174 (Broadway Street) runs through the city, leading north to the center of Burleson and south to the center of Cleburne. Fort Worth is north of Joshua. According to the United States Census Bureau, Joshua has a total area of , of which , or 0.47%, is covered by water. The north side of the city is drained by Village Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, while the south side is drained by tributaries of East Buffalo Creek, flowing to the Nolan River, part of the Brazos River watershed. History Joshua is in the Cross Timbers region of Texas, on land patented by W. W. Byers in 1867. The section was sold in 1874 to John Powell. Caddo Grove, east of Joshua, was the first community in the area. It had its own post office and was a thriving town until the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was completed from Cleburne to Fort Worth in 1881. The railroad missed Caddo Grove, and a station was built on the tracks at the site of future Joshua. The station was originally called \\"Caddo Peak\\", but the name was rejected by the post office because of another community with that name. The name \\"Joshua\\" was chosen, purportedly by Dr. D. B. McMillan, after the biblical Joshua. W. L. West was the first postmaster when the community received a post office in 1882. In 1883, Caddo Grove's post office was withdrawn. The plat for Joshua was first surveyed in 1880, and the community was organized in 1881 when the railroad arrived. The first store, opened in 1882 by W. L. West, also housed the post office. By 1890, Joshua had a population of 300, two steam-powered corn mills and cotton gins, a hotel, a general store, and a newspaper, the Johnson County Record. The railroad shipped farm produce, Joshua's largest export. The first one-room school opened in 1890, and in 1899, it moved into a new building. In 1917, this school became Joshua High School. In 1900 and 1912, Joshua suffered major fires. In spite of this, new businesses continued to open. The Citizen's Banking Company, opened in 1904, was run by J. W. Spencer. Two years later, a public water system began. Truck gardens, orchards, and corn and cotton farms surrounded Joshua. In 1912, the Fort Worth South Traction Line began to provide interurban rail service from Cleburne to Fort Worth, with a stop in Joshua. Service stopped in 1932 because of the growing importance of automobile travel. The first car in Joshua was purchased in 1913. By 1914, the community had a population of 824, two cotton gins, an ice plant, a bank, a newspaper named the Joshua Star, and four churches. Local farms grew cotton and potatoes. In the mid-1950s, Joshua was incorporated, with Ted Strube as the first mayor. The population dropped to 550 during the 1950s and rose to 924 in 1970. By 1980, it was 1,470. Because of its proximity to Fort Worth, the population grew to 3,828 by 1990. Joshua had 14 businesses in 1970 and 58 in 1980, when seven local manufacturers made such items as aluminum products, boat trailers, leather goods, and windows. The Joshua Tribune began publication in 1970 and was published until the early 1990s, when it moved to Burleson.Johnson County History Book Committee, History of Johnson County, Texas (Dallas: Curtis Media, 1985)Joshua Historical Committee, Joshua: As It Was and Is (Cleburne, Texas, 1977)Lisa C. Maxwell, \\"Joshua\\", Handbook of Texas Online, (accessed July 16, 2006), copyright ¬© Texas State Historical Association] William Leech West, a Confederate Civil War veteran born in Alabama, but more recently from Mississippi, owned a large farm to the east of the town of Caddo Grove. Family legend says that upon arriving in Texas, he temporarily left his wife and children in the wagon yards in Fort Worth and rode a horse south. His intent was to find an area with no fences. He journeyed for several days until he found the area he liked near the geographic feature of Caddo Peak in Johnson County. W.L. West owned and operated a grocery store and post office in Caddo Grove, until the railroad bypassed the small community. Along with the rest of the businessmen of Caddo Grove, he moved the entire building housing his store into Joshua when the railroad came. This building, with its actual dimensional lumber, was later dismantled in the 1940s and the salvaged wood used for an addition to his son Samuel A. West's house on Main Street in Joshua. The original house on the old West farm burned in a fire in the 1930s. The Wests donated a large portion of the land for the Caddo Grove Cemetery. His wife and he, and many of his descendants, are buried in this cemetery in a large plot near the center of the cemetery. A portion of the original homestead land is still owned by one of his grandchildren today. W.L. West's son Samuel Abe West was a prominent citizen of Joshua for 93 years. He was an Army veteran of World War I, although he had a difficult time being accepted for enlistment due to an injury received as a child. While crossing the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad tracks and under a stopped train, the train moved and pinched a portion of his upper arm. Due to this injury and the lack of a biceps muscle, he was only allowed to enlist in the Finance Corps. He served at Camp Travis, which is now in the location of the parade fields at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He ended his enlistment, never serving overseas. S.A. West was mustered out as a sergeant first class paymaster. He was born in a cabin on the West homestead in 1887 and worked in various banking operations for relatives. Later, he owned the grocery store on Main Street in Joshua (where the private detective agency is located now). He was known to lend people money and food during hard times, especially the Depression. When he finally closed down the store in the early 1970s, his son and daughter found numerous unpaid IOUs. He was also a town alderman during the 1950s, a member of the First United Methodist Church and a member of the Masonic Lodge. He was one of the very few Republicans in Johnson County at the time. Theodore \\"Ted\\" Roosevelt Strube was the first mayor of Joshua about 1949 and was one of the founders of the Masonic Lodge in Joshua. His wife, Sylvia Couch Strube, was the first florist of Joshua. Demographics As of the census of 2000, 4,528 people, 1,610 households, and 1,252 families were residing in the city.

Karnes City is a city in and county seat of Karnes County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,042 at the 2010 census, down from 3,457 at the 2000 census. The town was named after Henry Karnes of the Texas Revolution. Karnes is southeast of Floresville and southeast of San Antonio on U.S. Highway 181.  History  In 1894, as a result of a special election, the county seat was moved from Helena to Karnes City. Ten years earlier, Colonel William G. Butler (1831‚Äì1912) had blamed Helena and its corrupt mayor for the death of his son, Emmett, who was killed on December 26, 1884, by a stray bullet from a bar fight. Butler, a wealthy rancher, retaliated by arranging for the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway, which started construction in 1885, to bypass Helena. The railway started operation in 1886. By 1890, with no rail line, Helena was at a disadvantage for serving the county's needs. In 1890, a group of businessmen purchased land on the rail line, southwest of Helena, with the specific intent of building a new town to serve as the county seat. The new town, named for Colonel Henry Wax Karnes (1812‚Äì1840), veteran of the Texas Revolution and a leader of the Texas Rangers, was a viable settlement by 1894, when the county voted to move its seat from Helena. Karnes City continued to grow, while Helena faded into a ghost town. The story was fictionalized in the 1969 episode \\"The Oldest Law\\" of the television series Death Valley Days. In the episode, Jim Davis played the role of Colonel Butler, while Stacy Harris played Helena's mayor. Geography Karnes City is located in central Karnes County at (28.8882, -97.9013).

The population was 1,154 at the 2010 census.  History  The community was named for Sara Kemp, mother of Levi Noble, the first postmaster, and was officially established when the post office opened in 1851. The original townsite was located on present-day County Road 4023 south of present-day Texas State Highway 274. It grew slowly during its first thirty years. A Presbyterian congregation was organized in 1854, and the Kemp Academy of Learning began operation in 1867. After the Civil War an increasing number of settlers moved to the community. In 1870 Dr. A. J. Still, hoping to profit from this growth and the possible construction of a railroad through the area, bought land just north of the community (where the current city sits) and, after surveying, dividing the tract into lots, and platting it, persuaded the directors of the Southern Pacific Railroad to lay tracks across his property by offering the company a number of lots. Another early settler, Sam Parmalee, followed suit and offered the rail company right-of-way through his property. The mid-1880s witnessed the completion of the rail line through the community, the construction of a depot there, and the designation of Kemp as a terminus on the line. The railroad attracted settlers to Kemp. Prospering with the surrounding cattle ranches and cotton farms, the community developed as a trade center for the lower part of the county. By the early twentieth century the population had reached 513, and the Methodist and Baptist congregations had established churches. Kemp also supported a local newspaper, the Kemp News. The paper was owned and edited by Mike S. Boggess. In 1926 the town had a population of 1,200, sixty businesses, and two banks. By 1936, 46 businesses operated in Kemp. The population declined from 1,000 to 816 between the end of World War II and the mid-1960s. Businesses declined from 41 to 33.

History Treue der Union monument in Comfort Steves' Hygieostatic Bat Roost Former Comfort State Bank, now the Comfort Heritage Foundation Close-up of Hotel Faust on High Street in Comfort Peter Joseph Ingenhuett (1833-1923) was a businessman and postmaster in the early years of Comfort. His restored house preserves 19th century history. Christmas is observed in Comfort with a nativity scene at Comfort Park. The town square at Christmas Comfort was established in 1854 by German immigrants, who were Freethinkers and abolitionists. Ernst Hermann Altgelt, at the age of 22, is credited with surveying and measuring the lots that would later be sold to the incoming German immigrants. He stayed and married Emma (Murck) Altgelt, and they raised their nine children in the township of Comfort. Fritz and Betty Holekamp built the first house in Comfort, having started construction before Comfort's official founding on September 3, 1854.Stewart, Anne and Mike; Ernst Hermann Altgelt: Founder of Comfort, Texas; 2010 The first churches were not established in Comfort until 1900. After some controversy, a cenotaph honoring \\"the Founding Freethinkers\\" was dedicated on November 2, 2002. The downtown area is possibly one of the most well-preserved historic business districts in Texas. There are well over 100 structures in the area dating back to the 19th century, and seven of them were designed by the noted architect Alfred Giles. Mr. Giles lived in San Antonio, and he would ride horses, the stagecoach, and later the train to check his building sites in Comfort. Most of the population today is composed of descendants of those original pioneer families of the 1850s and the 1860s. Comfort is also known for a tragic event that took place during the American Civil War. The Treue der Union Monument (\\"Loyalty to the Union\\") was dedicated in honor of 35 men who died at the Battle of the Nueces, which took place because they opposed the state's secession from the Union. The German settlers were killed on their way to Mexico during the Civil War. They were attacked by Confederate forces near Brackettville on August 10, 1862. The bodies were not buried, and the bones were retrieved and placed here in 1865. The monument was erected in 1866. In 1918, Albert Steves erected a Hygieostatic Bat Roost on his family farm in Comfort. This roost was built to attract bats in an effort to control mosquito populations by natural means. It was originally researched and developed by Dr. Charles Agustus Rosenheimer Campbell of San Antonio. The idea was to use bats against malaria-carrying mosquitos. At one time, there were sixteen bat roosts built in the United States and Europe, of which only two sites now remain ‚Äî one in Comfort and one in the Florida Keys.

It is located in the northeastern portion of the county, and the population was 534 as of the 2010 census. History Jayton's history begins in the 1880s. Originally known as \\"Jay Flat\\", it was established northeast of its present location and named after a local ranching family. A post office was granted in 1886, and Daniel Jay served as the community's first postmaster. In 1907, the townsite was moved to its present location for improved proximity to rail service, and it was officially renamed \\"Jayton\\" later that same year. The community's first newspaper, the Jayton Herald, was established the following year, and the city incorporated in February 1910. By 1925, Jayton was home to 750 residents. From the community's inception, the local economy had originally been supported mainly by the cotton industry, but the Dust Bowl of the 1930s had a dire effect on production. The community's economy was stabilized by the discovery of oil later that same decade, and while its population never exceeded 750, Jayton remained stable throughout the Great Depression. In 1954, following a lengthy and heated court battle, the city wrested the title of county seat from the declining nearby community of Clairemont, and in 1957, a courthouse was constructed. Jayton's population remained around 600 from the 1950s through the 1980 census before declining to 513 in 1990 and 441 in 2000, but a resurgence in the local oil industry led to a rebound, and the 2010 census counted 534 residents.

The population of Kerrville was 22,347 at the 2010 census and an estimated 23,754 in 2019. Kerrville is named after James Kerr, a major in the Texas Revolution, and friend of settler-founder Joshua Brown, who settled in the area to start a shingle-making camp. Being nestled in the hills of Texas Hill Country, Kerrville is best known for its beautiful parks that line the Guadalupe River, which runs directly through the city; other features include its nearby youth summer camps, hunting ranches, and RV parks. It is also the home of Texas' Official State Arts & Crafts Fair, the Kerrville Folk Festival, as well as Mooney Aviation Company, James Avery Jewelry, and Schreiner University. The Museum of Western Art (founded 1983) features the work of living artists specializing in the themes of the American West.  History  Archeological evidence suggests that humans dwelled in the area known as Kerrville as early as 10,000 years ago. The early modern residents were successful shinglemakers whose mercantile business became a hub that served the middle and upper Hill Country area in the late 1840s. One of the earliest shinglemakers was Joshua D. Brown. With his family, Joshua Brown had led several other families on an exploration of the Guadalupe Valley. These early pioneers organized their settlements near a bluff just north of the Guadalupe River in the eastern half of today's county. The settlement was referred to as \\"Brownsborough\\", but after the area was formally platted in 1856 by James Kerr, a major in the Texas Revolution, the settlement was formally known as \\"Kerrville\\" and maintained a county seat with Texas. Starting in 1857, a German master-miller named Christian Dietert and millwright Balthasar Lich started a large grist and saw mill on the bluff. This mill established a permanent source of power and protection from floods, and became the most extensive operation of its kind in the Hill Country area west of New Braunfels and San Antonio. Soon afterwards, Charles A. Schreiner rode Kerrville's newly found popularity by serving Kerrville's mercantile needs. Schreiner established a family-run empire that helped build Kerrville's early prosperity by owning almost all of Kerrville's business sectors, including freighting enterprises, retail, wholesale, banking, ranching, marketing, and brokering operations. Schreiner's elegant downtown home, a Romanesque stone structure at 226 Earl Garrett Street, is the site of the Hill Country Museum in downtown Kerrville. The Civil War slowed Kerrville's development, but with the start of the Reconstruction era, Kerrville's economic boom and ethnic diversification continued anew as demand grew in San Antonio for lumber, produce, and craftsmen. Kerrville's boom was also catalyzed by the combination of the cessation of Indian raids and the expansion into the business of cattle, sheep, and goat ranching. Cattle drives punctuated the boom-years of the late 1880s and the 1890s. In 1887, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway reached Kerrville, and in 1889 the town incorporated, with an aldermanic form of city government. The Kerrville Water Works Company began to provide water for town dwellers in 1894. Telephone service was introduced in 1896, and the city began to pave streets in 1912. Kerrville adopted a \\"commission\\" form of city government in 1917, then changed to the \\"city-manager\\" form in 1928. In 1942, the town adopted a home-rule charter, while continuing with a city manager. Kerrville has displayed steady population growth throughout the 20th century, increasing from 1,423 residents in 1900 to 2,353 in 1920, 5,572 in 1940, 8,901 in 1960, and 15,276 in 1980. Its economic base has diversified and broadened through business, agriculture, light manufacturing, health care, transportation, services, education, the arts, and tourism. By the mid-1990s the Wall Street Journal described Kerrville as one of the wealthiest small towns in America. By 1995, the city's official population was still under 18,000, with another 20,000 people in relatively affluent residential areas south of the river and in the rest of the county. In 2000, the population reached 20,425. Much of the growth in population included retirees and young professionals and semiprofessionals; for many years Kerrville also experienced significant out-migration of young adults raised in the area.

The population was 2,574 at the 2010 census. Geography Junction is located at (30.489772, -99.771335), about northwest of San Antonio and west of Austin in central Kimble County. Interstate 10 runs through the northern and eastern parts of the city, with access from Exits 456 and 457. I-10 leads southeast to Kerrville and beyond to San Antonio, and west to Sonora.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Junction has a total area of , of which , or 0.26%, are covered by water. The city is named for its location at the confluence of the North and South Llano Rivers. History Pedernales Electric Cooperative office in Junction Business and Professional Women Municipal swimming pool in Junction The community was founded in 1876 after the organization of Kimble County earlier that year. The original town site was named \\"Denman\\" after Marcellus Denman, who had surveyed and platted the new community. The name was quickly changed to \\"Junction City\\". In late 1876, Junction City won the designation of county seat from the unsuccessful and flood-prone settlement of Kimbleville. By 1879, a drugstore, livery stable, sawmill, and a few general stores were active in the community. Around 300 people were living in Junction City in 1882. The West Texas, Kimble County's first newspaper, began publishing in 1882. The county courthouse and its records were lost to a fire in 1884. A second, two- story brick stone courthouse was partially destroyed in an 1888 fire, but was repaired and remained in use until 1929, when the present courthouse was constructed. In 1894, Junction City became known simply as \\"Junction\\". Infrastructure improvements marked the decade of the 1890s. Businessman Ernest Holekamp provided the city's first waterworks with a canal dug from the South Llano to Junction in 1895. A dam was built in 1896 on the South Llano River to provide power and water to the city and irrigation to surrounding lands. The population stood at 536 in 1900. Four Mile Dam, a more permanent and extensive dam, was completed in 1904. Junction continued to grow rapidly, with around 800 residents living in the community in 1910. That figure had grown to 1,250 by 1920. By the late 1920s, citizens felt the need for the benefits of a municipal government. On August 27, 1927, H.O. Denman and 152 others presented an incorporation petition to Kimble County Judge J.B. Randolph.

The population was 1,688 at the 2010 census, down from 1,876 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Kinney County. History Founded in 1852 as \\"Las Moras\\" (the name of a nearby spring and the creek it feeds), the town initially was a supply stop on the old San Antonio-El Paso road and a supply depot for the U.S. Army's Fort Clark (the fort was established the same year). Later the town was named \\"Brackett\\" after Oscar B. Brackett, the owner of the first dry goods store in the area. In 1873, when a post office was awarded, \\"ville\\" was appended to the name to differentiate it from another town. The town grew quickly through the 19th century with the expansion of the garrison at Fort Clark for the Indian Wars. The town's fortunes were tied to the fort. For many years, it was the base of the famous Buffalo Soldiers, made up of African Americans. Demographically, Brackettville had a larger proportion of Black Seminoles (people of mixed African American and Seminole ancestry, who originated in Florida) than the rest of West Texas, as they had been recruited by the US to act as scouts for the Buffalo Soldiers and settled with their families in the town. During the slavery years, they had been living in a settlement in northern Mexico to escape US conditions. Their language developed in Florida, Afro-Seminole Creole, is still spoken by some in Brackettville. After the Buffalo Soldiers moved out of Fort Clark with the waning of the Indian Wars, it was used as a cavalry post. The Seminole Negro Indian Scouts were finally disbanded as a unit in 1914. Virtually every cavalry unit in the U.S. Army was stationed at or trained at Fort Clark at one time or another. In 1943 during World War II, the U.S. Army activated the Second Cavalry Division, which was to be the Army's last horse-mounted unit. By 1944, even the Second had been mechanized. Fort Clark, so long a center of mounted cavalry, was targeted for closure. Before its closure, the fort was used as a German prisoner-of-war camp. Because of the families of soldiers at the fort and African-American veterans and descendants who had settled here, during the war, the US government funded construction of a high school for black students, which opened in April 1944, so the children of veterans could be educated. The state of Texas was still racially segregated; it had essentially disenfranchised blacks since the early 20th century by its voter registration and electoral requirements, and the white legislature consistently underfunded black education and services. Officially classified as a four-year high school, it is believed to have been the only one of its kind between San Antonio and El Paso at that time. After the fort officially closed in 1946, it had a variety of uses. In 1971 it was converted and adapted as a resort/retirement center. The historic district of the fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The resort is not the economic engine the fort once was, and Brackettville has shrunk from its peak population during the war years. Cultural matters The Alamo starring John Wayne North of town is a tourist attraction called Alamo Village, built in the 1950s as the set of John Wayne's movie The Alamo. Scenes from the 1969 comedy Viva Max! were also shot here. As of July 2009, Alamo Village has been closed to the public. It is available for film production and special events such as weddings and receptions.\\"The Alamo movie set closes as owners figure out what's next\\" , My San Antonio website In 1958 and 1959, the syndicated western television series Mackenzie's Raiders, starring Richard Carlson as Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, with Morris Ankrum, Louis Jean Heydt, and Jack Ging, was set at the former Fort Clark near Brackettville though it was filmed at the former Fort Apache at the former Corriganville Movie Ranch near Simi Valley, California.

By 1896, the town had its first school, and by 1900, it had 100 residents. The Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad (later part of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and today part of the Union Pacific Railroad) had chosen Spofford over Brackettville. At Spofford, they laid a spur to Eagle Pass, and the main line continued west to Langtry. At various times, Spofford was a stop on the Sunset Limited. The population reached the high-water mark of 373 people in the mid-1940s. After the school consolidations in the '40s, Spofford's students were bused to Brackettville.

Located on the U.S. Route 77 corridor between Corpus Christi and Harlingen, Kingsville is the principal city of the Kingsville Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Corpus Christi-Kingsville Combined Statistical Area. The population was 26,213 at the 2010 census, and in 2019 the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population at 25,315. Named in honor of Richard King, the city was founded to provide infrastructure for the adjacent King Ranch, as well as serve as the headquarters of the newly founded St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway. In 1904, the first tracks were laid and the first buildings constructed for the planned city. In 1911, the city was incorporated. It is home to Texas A&M; University-Kingsville, a member of the Texas A&M; University System, and Naval Air Station Kingsville, one of the U.S. Navy's three locations for jet aviation training. History Kingsville, 1908 Kingsville, ca. 1910s Kingsville, 2011 The history of Kingsville is closely intertwined with the city's main creek, the Santa Gertrudis. The first recorded inhabitants of the area were the Coahuiltecan Malaquites, surviving on seafood from nearby Baffin Bay, with settlements along the Santa Getrudis and San Fernando creeks, and the Cayo del Grullo branch of Baffin Bay. Large herds of mustangs roamed the south Texas plains, often drinking from the waters of spring fed creeks in and around present-day Kingsville. In 1803, Jose Lorenzo de la Garza established a settlement along the Santa Gertrudis. In 1846, General Zachary Taylor and his army camped along the banks of the Santa Gertrudis prior to their campaign into Mexico. In 1899, after many failed attempts, King ranch manager Robert J. Kleberg, Jr., was finally able to tap into an underground lake of water. The discovery of readily accessible water paved the way for a future settlement next to the ranch. 20th Century With the continued growth of the King Ranch in the mid to late 19th century, the desire for a railroad through the region increased, both to connect the communities of the Rio Grande Valley to the rest of Texas, and to serve the King Ranch. At the turn of the 20th century, Henrietta King, widow of Richard King, deeded a portion of the ranch to entice the construction of a town and to bring a railroad adjacent to the ranch. Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. formed the Kleberg Town and Improvement Company in 1903, tasked with planning and constructing the town, at the bequest of his mother-in-law, Henrietta. In 1904, the community was planned three miles from the King Ranch headquarters and was named in honor of the founder of the King Ranch, Richard King. The community would also house the headquarters of the newly formed St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway, a deal that was reached with railroad magnate Benjamin Yoakum. The first buildings were constructed, track was laid through the town, and the first train passed through Kingsville on July 4, 1904, considered the founding date of the city. Kingsville's first post office was also established that year. By the close of the first decade of the 20th century, Kingsville already had a thriving business scene, with an active commercial club, that was the forerunner of the city's chamber of commerce today. In 1909, a library was established, an opera house built in 1910, and by 1911, the city was incorporated and the first city government was chartered. Two years later, in 1913, Kingsville was named the county seat of the newly established Kleberg County. Around 1920, oil and natural gas were discovered near Kingsville, leading to the city's first population boom. Segregationalist policies and Jim Crow laws were present in Kingsville during the beginning of the 20th century. By the 1920s, three distinct segregated communities had emerged, the Spanish-speaking Tejano and migrant Mexican community of farm workers to the north, the African-American community that mostly worked the railroad to the south, and the Anglo-American community in the center of the city along the downtown region. Common practice in Anglo-American controlled towns in South Texas, in the early 20th century, was to create segregated neighborhoods, evidenced by the planning of separate schools and churches for the three segregated communities. The Ku Klux Klan had a presence in the town, boosting a mayor to election in 1922, and was responsible for the lynching of a visiting African-American physician from nearby Bishop in 1923. In 1925, the South Texas Teachers College opened, one of only six normal schools in the entire state of Texas at the time, and the only south of College Station, Texas. The effort to open the school, led by King Ranch heir Caesar Kleberg and the city's commercial club, had been delayed due to political considerations in the state legislature, and funding issues from World War I. Later changing its name in 1929 to the Texas College of Arts and Industries (Texas A&I;), then to Texas A&I; University in 1967, the university went on to adopt its current name, Texas A&M; University- Kingsville in 1993, after it joined the Texas A&M; University System in 1989. In addition to offering a large swath of undergraduate and graduate degrees, the university is home to the National Natural Toxins Research Center, the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, and the Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, the doctorate of pharmacy program for the Texas A&M; University system. During the national defense build up to World War II, local civic leaders and Congressman Richard Kleberg, another heir to the King Ranch, lobbied the War Department to choose Kingsville and other South Texas communities as a future site for a military airfield. In 1941, a naval air station opened in nearby Corpus Christi, after lobbying efforts by Congressman Kleberg, and began training pilots for the Navy and Marine Corps. Following Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into the war, the need for increased pilot training and additional auxiliary airfields led to the Navy selecting Kingsville as the site of one, among several other municipalities. Plans were drawn up in 1941 and, in 1942, the U.S. Navy opened the new training airfield, Naval Air Auxiliary Station Kingsville, just to the east of town. Following World War II, the field was placed into a mothball status, but reopened shortly thereafter in 1951, and has been continuously operating since. NAS Kingsville is one of three major Naval Aviation jet training facilities for the Navy, and has had a significant impact on the economy and Kingsville's history. Several major industries have called Kingsville home throughout the city's history. In 1944, the Celanese Corporation opened a plant north of Kingsville that is still in operation today. In the early 1960s, Humble Oil and Refining Company, now known as Exxon, relocated a district office to Kingsville due to the city's close proximity to nearby oil fields. Population steadily increased in Kingsville, peaking at just under 30,000 residents in the mid 1980s. Since that time, the city has experienced a mild economic slump, with the closing of Exxon's district office, decreased enrollment at the university, and the decreased economic impact of the petroleum industry all cited as factors for the city's decline. Geography Kingsville is located in South Texas, approximately 33 miles (54 km) southwest of Corpus Christi, 91 miles (146 km) north of Harlingen and 101 miles (163 km) east of Laredo.

Kingsville is located in the geographic Gulf Coastal Plain region of the United States, known as the Coastal Bend in Texas, bordered by the Gulf of Mexico and Baffin Bay to the east, and the South Texas Plains or brush country to the north, west and south. Mesquite trees are found throughout the region, along with several types of cacti. Several creeks, fed by fresh-water springs, run through the city, including the San Fernando, Santa Gertrudis, and Escondido Creeks, all feeding into Baffin Bay. Ragland Mercantile Company Building, in downtown Kingsville Damage from Tropical Storm Hermine in 2010 Kingsville is located in the historic Wild Horse Desert, an area of South Texas and northern Mexico where enormous herds of wild mustangs roamed. Due to water pumping and other environmental factors, the abundance of spring-fed creeks has decreased. Wildlife surrounding Kingsville include deer, wild turkey, and javelinas. Additionally, Kingsville is a winter home to a large number of waterfowl species, including geese, ducks, and pelicans. The city is surrounded by farmland producing various crops including cotton and sorghum. The terrain around Kingsville is generally flat, with an elevation of 59 feet above sea level at city center. The city was planned in a grid system, and consists mostly of neighborhoods and subdivisions, as well as retail strip malls, located north and south of the main downtown area. Historic downtown runs from City Hall to the Kleberg County Courthouse, and features several buildings dating back to the turn of the century. Texas A&M; University-Kingsville is located in the northwest section of the city, and Naval Air Station Kingsville is located east of Highway 77, which bisects the city north to south. There are several buildings in Kingsville recognized on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Kleberg County Courthouse, the Nance-Jones House, the John B. Ragland Mercantile Company Building located in the historic downtown area, which is also recognized as a historic district, and the original schoolhouse for the Henrietta M. King High School, which was recently renovated and houses the offices of the city government today.  Climate  The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Kingsville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps. Due to the city's close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, several hurricanes and tropical storms have made landfall in Kingsville. In 1916, a category 4 hurricane made landfall at Baffin Bay and directly hit Kingsville, inflicting nearly $100,000 of damage.

Its population was 3,603 at the 2010 census. La Salle County had 6,886 persons in the 2010 census. In 2018, Cotulla estimated its population at 4,136. History Immigrant Joseph Cotulla, who was reared in Silesia, then a part of Prussia, migrated to the United States in the 1850s. He joined the Union Army in Brownsville, Texas. He lived in Atascosa County, but arrived in La Salle County in 1868 to establish what became a large ranching operation. After learning that the International-Great Northern Railroad intended to lay tracks in La Salle County, he worked to establish the town that bears his name. In 1881, Cotulla donated 120 acres of his land to the railroad, and in 1882, a depot was constructed there. In 1883, the town was granted a post office. The same year, Cotulla became the county seat by special election. Joseph Cotulla's great-grandson, William Lawrence Cotulla (born around 1936), a former storekeeper in Cotulla, is a rancher in La Salle, Dimmit, and Webb Counties. In a 2013 interview with the Laredo Morning Times, William Cotulla noted the community of his birth has changed completely in less than 80 years, having gone through several phases, beginning with emphasis on farming, then ranching, thereafter hunting leases, and now petroleum and natural gas through the Eagle Ford Shale boom.Ricardo R. Villarreal, \\"City experiences tremendous growth, activity due to oil and gas production\\", Laredo Morning Times, June 29, 2013, pp. 1, 12A With declining gasoline prices, though, the Eagle Ford boom took a sharp downturn by the fall of 2015.Jennifer Hiller, \\"Hard Times Hit Eagle Ford\\", San Antonio Express-News, January 3, 2016, pp. 1, A20 On June 28, 2013, the Texas Historical Commission, the United States Department of the Interior, and the National Register of Historic Places designated downtown Cotulla as a significant part of Texas history with the unveiling of an historic marker. In 2006, Cotulla had been designated as a Texas Main Street community. City manager Lazaro \\"Larry\\" Dovalina (born 1947), who formerly held the same position in Laredo, compared the impact of the recent growth of Cotulla to the arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century. Cotulla is believed to have tripled in population since the 2010 census, with possibly 12,000 residents in 2013. With Eagle Ford Shale and many jobs in the oil and gas fields, Cotulla has seen the building of new hotels, restaurants, truck stops, and refineries. Many older buildings downtown are being updated and renovated for other uses. Dovalina reported that the ad valorem property tax base in Cotulla has increased from $52 million in 2009 to $127 million in 2013. The growth has made affordable housing a premium in the community.Ricardo R. Villarreal, \\"Cotulla, Texas: Phenomenal Growth\\", Laredo Morning Times, June 30, 2013, pp. 1, 15A In 1973, two railroad locomotives collided in Cotulla, and three people were killed as a result. In 2008, the area around Cotulla burned in a huge grass fire. With continuing growth from the Eagle Ford Shale deposit, Cotulla houses the largest sand fracking facility in North America. Cotulla falls within the second-largest oil- producing region of the United States. The oil boom has increased sales tax collections in Cotulla from $445,000 in 2009 to more than $3 million in 2013. The city has 16 hotels and seven others under construction. The hotel-motel tax of 7% is less than that in larger surrounding cities. Cotulla is seeking to attract Walmart, H-E-B, and other companies once it can show that its growth is sustainable.Gabriela A.

In July 1901, Littlefield purchased the southern, or Yellow Houses, division of the XIT Ranch, forming the Yellow House Ranch. At that time, the ranch covered in Lamb, Hockley, Bailey, and Cochran Counties. In 1912, when surveys showed that a new rail line from Coleman, Texas, to Texico, New Mexico, would pass through his property, Littlefield formed the Littlefield Lands Company to sell the northeastern corner of the Yellow House Ranch, a total of , to settlers and to establish the town of Littlefield in Lamb County.

Unsolved murder case On October 26, 1943, Littlefield was shocked by the murder of physician Roy Hunt and his wife, the former Mae Franks. Hunt, a Lubbock native, graduated from the University of Texas Medical School at Galveston and opened the Littlefield Clinic in 1937. While Dr. Hunt died of a gunshot wound, Mrs. Hunt was bludgeoned to death by a gun. Their bodies, bound together, were found in bed by the couple's five-year-old daughter, who ran screaming to neighbors for help. An estimated 1,500 mourners attended the funerals in the First Methodist Church of Littlefield, which seated only 300. Some 1,200 people stood outside the overflowing church to pay respects. A $15,000 reward was offered, and Governor Coke R. Stevenson took a personal interest in the case.Christena Stephens of Sundown, Texas, \\"The Hunt Murders in Littlefield, Texas, 1943\\", Annual meeting, West Texas Historical Association, Lubbock, Texas, April 3, 2009; The paper was published under the title \\"Double Murder in a Small West Texas Town\\" in the West Texas Historical Association Year Book. An investigation revealed that Dr. Hunt had also been shot twice in May 1942 by Dr. W.R. Newton, a former medical-school classmate who claimed that Hunt was showing an interest in Newton's wife, Ruth. Another suspect, Jim Clyde Thomas, was gunned down in a personal disagreement on August 22, 1951, in Durant, Oklahoma. The murders, called the \\"most heinous on the Texas South Plains\\", remain unsolved. The Hunts are interred at the City of Lubbock Cemetery; their two young daughters were reared by Mrs. Hunt's sister.

The bus was struck on the railroad street intersection on what is now N Eastside Ave. The accident occurred a little after 4:00 pm, with death certificates noting the time of death at 4:05 pm.Death Certificate, Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics. Aurora Ortiz, 13458. February 6, 1973. Rec'd March 23, 1973. Police investigation determined that the train was travelling eastbound at 58 mph when it struck the rear half of the northbound bus, causing injuries or death to all 23 children in the bus and injuring the driver, 68 year-old Artis Ray Johnson. Jean Patterson, bus driver of the bus behind Johnson's, as well as three students who were in Johnson's bus, claimed that the bus had stopped at a warning crossing that had functioning lights and bells before moving over the tracks and being struck. Artis Ray Johnson, the bus driver, was cited by Littlefield police the next day for failure to possess a chauffeur's license, which at the time had the penalty of a $200 fine. DPS records indicated that Johnson obtained a commercial driving license on June 8, 1959, after four failed attempts. Despite lacking a proper license, Johnson was hired by Claude Oliver, foreman of Littlefield's school buses. Oliver later explained that he had known Johnson while Johnson worked as a custodian at an elementary school, and that Johnson had driven school buses occasionally when needed. Oliver claimed that he did not check Johnson's record because he knew Johnson was a good driver. The majority of the children were from Fieldton, Texas. The victims were Edward Ortiz, 17, his sister Aurora Ortiz, 9, David Frausto, 18, his sister Diana Frausto, 9, Mary Medina, 10, Anita Martinez, 18, and Julie Davis, 9. The accident caused a major impact in the community. Joe Frausto, father of David and Diana Frausto, was driving through town when he came upon the scene of the accident and saw the bodies of his children. Members of the community volunteered to stay with the Frausto, Ortiz, Medina, Martinez, and Davis families, ensuring that the families would not be left alone. Teachers reported leading their students in prayer and some discussion, but for the most part contemporary reports reflected a quiet response from elementary school students, even as the wrecked bus was temporarily moved into a field within sight of the school. The bus route was continued within days, with Claude Oliver serving as bus driver. Two memorial services were held on February 8, 1973, for the students. The first was held at the Littlefield Junior High School auditorium in the morning before classes started, and was for Junior and High School students. The second service was held in the same auditorium later in the day for kindergarten through sixth grade students. The police probe into the accident did not lead to any criminal charges. A suit was filed on March 3, 1973 by the Ortiz family against the Santa Fe railroad company and Artis Ray Johnson for the deaths of Edward and Aurora Ortiz and for the injuries of Betty Ortiz. The Foley family also filed a suit for the injuries received by their son, Terry. An earlier suit was also filed by three families of victims. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad Co. filed a 3rd party suit against Johnson for lacking the qualification to drive the bus and against Littlefield ISD for negligence in hiring Johnson.

The population was 6,681 at the 2010 census. It is the seat of Lampasas County. Lampasas is part of the Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood Metropolitan Statistical Area. History For his services in the Texas Revolution, John Burleson received of land and established a permanent settlement in the 1850s. The city was first named Burleson; however, the name was gradually changed to Lampasas Springs because of the existence of seven mineral springs. When the county was created in 1856, the law specified \\"The county seat shall be same name as the county.\\" The city of Lampasas was officially incorporated in 1883. Several theories attempt to explain how the name Lampasas came to be. The Texas Almanac states the word came from a Spanish word for \\"lilies\\" found in nearby streams. Another source states the word comes from the Spanish name Lampazos. The name was given to the local river by the Spanish Aquayo Expedition in 1721. It is believed the name was inspired by a Mexican town that also had beautiful springs. The town was also the location of the birth of the Farmers' Alliance, founded in 1876. The Mother's Day Flood of 1957 had Sulphur Creek, a local river, strike the city in devastating flash flood which claimed five lives and destroyed many homes, businesses, and other property around downtown Lampasas. In the aftermath, a series of levees and reservoirs was constructed to prevent damage from future catastrophes.http://www.lampasaschamber.org/5559938_47902.htm Since 1972, Lampasas has held an annual fair called the Spring Ho festival each July. Like nearby Mineral Wells, Lampasas has mineral springs health spas which once claimed to cure \\"everything\\". The 25-bed Rollins Brook Community Hospital in Lampasas was established by two physicians in 1935: Herbert Bailey Rollins, originally from Pineville, Kentucky, and W. M. Brooks. In 1958, Rollins Brook was the smallest accredited hospital in Texas. In 1981, Rollins was sold to a for-profit health care provider in Houston. Over the next decade, the hospital passed through a succession of owners. In 1991, the hospital declared bankruptcy and closed its doors without notice. Thereafter, citizens, unable to locate government or foundation grants, raised some $600,000 in community fund-raising activities to reclaim the facility. When it reopened on July 21, 1991, Rollins Brook became the only community hospital to survive bankruptcy. The story was broadcast by ABC News with Peter Jennings. In 1997, the hospital was sold again, this time to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In 2005, Rollins Brook opened a new surgical section.Patricia Benoit, Temple Daily Telegram, \\"Beside the Healing Waters: Rescuing Rollins Brook Community Hospital\\", West Texas Historical Association, annual meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, February 27, 2010 Geography Lampasas is located at (31.065868, -98.183444).

Its population was 5,665 at the 2010 census. The city's motto is \\"Giddings, Texas: Experience Hometown Hospitality\\". History The land where the city of Giddings now stands was part of the land granted to Stephen F. Austin in 1821 for a colony in Spanish Texas, and later became part of the Robertson Colony.\\"Giddings, TX.\\" Handbook of Texas. Retrieved on August 21, 2010. The Lee County Courthouse in Giddings (built 1899) Giddings Area Pumpjack The city itself was founded in 1871 when the Houston and Texas Central Railway came to the area. It probably took its name from local magnate Jabez Deming Giddings, who was instrumental in bringing the railway to the area. He had come to the area from Pennsylvania in 1838 to claim the land bounty of his brother Giles A. Giddings, killed at the Battle of San Jacinto. Another theory is that the city was named after Jabez's brother Dewitt Clinton Giddings. Early settlers in the new town were mostly pioneers from the surrounding communities, such as Old Evergreen and Shady Grove. The majority of these people were ethnically British Isles natives, but a sizable minority were Wendish families from the Serbin area. They would later establish the German-language newspaper Deutsches Volksblatt. A syndicate headed by William Marsh Rice owned the whole townsite and sold property to settlers. Later, Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston had control and sold the lots. Wide streets were a distinguishing characteristic of the town; the two main thoroughfares (Main and Austin Streets) were 100 feet (30 m) wide, and other streets were 80 feet (24 m) wide. The town's first church, established in 1871, was Methodist. J. D. Giddings Masonic Lodge, chartered in Evergreen in 1865, moved to Giddings, and early churches and a public school met in its building. Soon after the Civil War, freed slaves from farms and plantations settled in Giddings. Classes for more than 50 black students were held in a church in 1883, and the first black public school was built in 1887. Giddings became the county seat when Lee County was established in 1874. Early businesses included the Granger store, a blacksmith shop and saloon, a millinery shop, a saddle and harness shop, and an oil mill. Brick buildings came in 1875. The courthouse built in 1878 burned and was replaced in 1899. Fletcher House, built in 1879 by August W. Schubert, was sold to the Missouri Synod of the Immanuel Lutheran Church in 1894 to house Concordia Lutheran College. By 1890, the town was part of a rich cotton-growing area with access to the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway, several gins, an opera house, newspapers, and a population estimated at 1,000. The First National Bank was opened in 1890 and was still in operation more than a century later. The town was incorporated in 1913 and had a population of 2,000 by 1914. In the early 1980s, the oil-laden Austin chalk that underlies the town was tapped, and the area experienced an oil boom. Some 300 oil-related businesses located in the town, and many oil rigs were operating in outlying areas. In the late 1980s, however, the oil activities decreased almost to a standstill. The population of Giddings in 1988 was 5,178.

The population was 7,954 at the 2010 census.  History  In 1854, a church and convent was built by Father Peter La Cour near the town's present site. The town began forming in 1878 when Charles Lander Cleveland, a local judge, donated of land to the Houston East & West Texas Railway (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) for use as a stop, requesting that the town be named for him. Since 1900 Cleveland has served as the junction of this line and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe (now the BNSF Railway). The town was not incorporated until 1935. The forests around Cleveland, including Sam Houston National Forest, which is located just to its north, are a resort for many inhabitants of the Houston area, who come to camp, hike, hunt, and fish. Cleveland has several historic sites and public recreational facilities, including two parks. The Austin Memorial Library Center offers a wide range of services to the community, and the Texan Theater and the annual livestock show and rodeo, Dairy Days, provide entertainment. Commercially, Cleveland has been a shipping point for timber, lumber, and lumber byproducts since the 1870s. A large medical community, oil, gas, cattle, farm products, and sand and gravel are important to the town's economy. The general trend toward urbanization of the entire area is reflected by the fact that in 1965 Liberty County was added to the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of Cleveland grew from 1,200 in 1930 to 7,605 according to the census of 2000. In 1969, The Band included a song about the town, \\"Look Out Cleveland\\", on their acclaimed eponymous sophomore album, The Band. In 2011, 19 young men and teens from Cleveland were arrested for gang rapes of an 11-year-old girl.

U.S. 59 goes through the cities of Livingston, Lufkin, and Nacogdoches, and onward to Texarkana, Texas. US 59 is designated as the TTC-I-69 Corridor. U.S. Highway 59 Business is the original route of U.S. 59, which runs north and south through the center of Cleveland, known locally as Washington Avenue and Loop 573. A current limited-access bypass for U.S. 59 was created due to traffic densities in downtown Cleveland that rivaled those of many large cities. SH 105 travels east and west, and Cleveland is roughly the halfway point between Beaumont and Navasota. SH 105 runs concurrently with SH 321 until SH 105 splits, going eastbound to Beaumont, while SH 321 continues roughly further south into Dayton. Construction was recently completed on a loop coming off SH 105 near Pin Oak Road, along the southern side of Cleveland, crossing Interstate 69 and FM 1010, and terminating at SH 321 near New Salem Road.  Railroads  Cleveland is the meeting point of two rail lines. One is a north/south Union Pacific line that closely follows the path of Interstate 69. The other is an east/west Burlington Northern Santa Fe line that roughly follows FM 787 to the east, and SH 105 west towards Conroe. Union Tank Car Company has a tank repair/maintenance facility along the BNSF line on the outskirts of Cleveland off FM 787.

History Dayton, on U.S. Highway 90 six miles west of Liberty in southwestern Liberty County, was first called West Liberty and was considered part of the original town of Liberty, founded in 1831. The Trinity River divided the two parts of the town: Liberty was on its east bank, and West Liberty was on a hill three miles west of the river. A new road and a ferry directly connected the two. Both parts of the town were located on the four-league Mexican land grant appropriated for the capital of the old municipality of Sant√≠sima Trinidad de la Libertad, which later became known as Liberty. The postmaster of West Liberty from March 25, 1839, through September 15, 1841, was A. Thouvenin, probably the same man as Arnold Thouvenin, who obtained a quarter-league Mexican land grant in Polk County in April 1835. The West Liberty post office was apparently discontinued after a few years. Land was designated for a school in 1847. The schoolhouse was accepted on December 31, 1853, by the board of trustees of the Corporation of the Town of Liberty. Also in 1853, A. N. B. Thompson was authorized to survey and plat the town of West Liberty. During the Civil War, thirty-three ladies of West Liberty wrote to Governor Francis R. Lubbock in January 1863, petitioning him to relieve Mr. Sol Andrews of his military duties so that he might continue his vocation of manufacturer of looms and spinning wheels, as cloth for clothing was desperately needed. Sometime after 1854, West Liberty also became known as Day's Town, for I. C. Day, a wealthy landowner who resided just to the south of the town on the Munson league. The flag stop for the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, completed in 1860, was known variously as West Liberty, Days Station, and Dayton Station. The name Dayton was applied to the local post office in 1877, though the official name of the town remained West Liberty until the mid-1880s. In 1885 Dayton reported a population of sixty, and in 1890 a post office, a school, and two churches served its 239 residents. The single room schoolhouse has been preserved by the historical society. StationNT5Bmedia Lumbering and cattle raising were the chief industries until James E. Berry helped establish a drainage system to make rice a major crop.

Texas governor Marion Price Daniel, Sr., was born in Dayton on October 10, 1910; his brother Bill Daniel, governor of the United States Territory of Guam from 1961 through 1963, was born in Dayton on November 20, 1915. The Daniel brothers were grandsons of General Sam Houston\\"Texas Giant: The Life of Price Daniel\\", by Dan Murph who had led victory for the Republic of Texas independence in 1836. By 1910, the town had a bank, two cotton gins, a weekly newspaper, and 2,500 inhabitants. Dayton was recorded as an incorporated municipality on May 3, 1911. The mayor was W. M. Babcock, and aldermen were W. T. Jamison, J. H. Marshall, J. A. Coleman, and J. D. Spear. Town records indicate that the community was reincorporated in 1925. Oil development during the 1920s brought new industries. By 1940 Dayton reported 1,207 residents and seventy businesses and was listed as a railroad center. The population increased steadily from 3,367 in 1965 to 6,201 in 1988. In 1989 the largest school population in the county made the Dayton Independent School District the major employer in the city. At that time Dayton operated under a mayor-council form of city government.

Railroads Dayton is the meeting point of two rail lines. One is a north/south Union Pacific (UP) line that comes out of Baytown called the UP Baytown Subdivision. The other is the east/west UP Lafayette Subdivision line that roughly follows US 90. The BNSF has authority to operate its trains on the Baytown Subdivision from Dayton to just west of Baytown and has a rail yard just south of Dayton. Another rail line runs through the northern edge of the city, called the UP Beaumont Subdivision. A study is being performed by the Texas Department of Transportation regarding a Dayton-to-Cleveland single mainline rail corridor consisting of approximately 40 miles of track connecting the UP Lufkin Subdivision and the BNSF Conroe Subdivision near Cleveland to the UPRR Baytown Subdivision south of Dayton. Education The city of Dayton is served by the Dayton Independent School District. UFO incident Dayton was the home of three people involved in a famous UFO incident that occurred December 29, 1980 at approximately 9:00 p.m. Known as the Cash-Landrum incident. It occurred on FM 1485 near New Caney in Montgomery County and north of Crosby in Harris County. The site of the incident was approximately 20 miles due northwest of Dayton. The incident was witnessed from a distance by L.L. Walker, then a patrol officer with the Dayton Police Department, who confirmed seeing a bright object in the sky and military helicopters similar to those described by the three people closely involved. The three people involved were Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and her young grandson, Colby Landrum, then eight years old. They described that while driving along FM 1485 looking for an open Bingo parlor they encountered a large glowing object that was shooting flames that came down near the highway. It was so hot that Vickie Landrum burned her hands touching the dashboard of their car. Betty Cash got out of the car to see the object up closer. All three suffered skin injuries, but Cash's were the most severe and she had to be hospitalized. The most mysterious part of the incident was the women's description of several large, dark-colored twin-rotor helicopters that came along and seemed to escort the object away. This incident happened just six days after the also famous December 23, 1980 UFO incident at RAF Bentwaters, a US Air Force Base in England. In that incident witnesses described a similar, albeit smaller object, landing near the base perimeter on two consecutive nights. Based on the involvement of the helicopters the women sued the U.S. Air Force, alleging it had been operating some type of secret aircraft that caused their injuries. The case was ultimately dismissed by the court and the women received no compensation. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Dayton has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Dayton, Texas ReferencesExternal links * www.dayton-online.com - Dayton's Online Community. * www.unsolved.com/Unexplained/UFO - Television show that had shown this UFO Incident. * www.texasmonthly.com/ranch/ufo/dayton.php - More on this UFO incident. * https://web.archive.org/web/20070507134042/http://ufo.whipnet.org/xdocs/Cash.Landrum/Piney.Woods.html - another source concerning this UFO incident.

Texas Highways 7 and 14 and is one of three restaurants in the town. The First Baptist Church of Kosse was built in 1907. Kosse is a town in southern Limestone County, Texas, United States. The population was 464 at the 2010 census. Kosse calls itself \\"A Little Town with a Big Heart.\\" Geography Kosse is located at (31.307452, -96.630267). It is situated at the junction of State Highways 7 and 14 in southwestern Limestone County, approximately 16 miles east of Marlin and 17 miles south of Groesbeck. The closest large cities are Waco, 42 miles to the northwest, and Bryan/College Station, 52 miles south of Kosse. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History= Early Settlement  Initial settlement of the area began in the mid-1840s as a community known as Eutaw. Settlers built homes near Duck Creek and Eutaw was a stage stop for the Franklin-Springfield and Waco-Marlin stage routes.  Arrival of the Houston & Texas Central Railway  Following the Civil War, the area was in the planned route of the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&TC;) which was being constructed to link Houston to Dallas, Denison and the Red River. The H&TC; set aside one acre of land along the rail line two miles west of Eutaw as a townsite, and named it for chief engineer Theodore Kosse. For several months in late 1870 and early 1871, Kosse was the northernmost terminus of the railway, and the population briefly boomed. But by the spring of 1871, the rail line had been extended further north to the new terminus of Groesbeck and Kosse's population was considerably reduced. By 1873, Logan's Railway Business Directory noted that Kosse \\"contains about 200 inhabitants and is doing little business. When it was the terminus it was a thriving place, now its glory has faded. Cattle constitute the bulk of shipments from here.\\"  Incorporation and Early Years  The new town of Kosse was formally incorporated by an Act of the Texas Legislature on May 22, 1871. The Act named G. N. Beaumont, D. T. Igleheart, J. Huey, R. H. Fielder and a Mr. Young to be commissioners to lay off the town and make a town plat. The town's first officers were appointed by the Governor, and the first general election was held on the second Tuesday in November, 1872, at which time a mayor, constable and five aldermen were elected for a two year term. The town was named for H&TC;'s chief engineer, Theodore Kosse.  Late 19th Century  The first census of Kosse was taken in 1880 when it had a population of 476. Five years later, Kosse had multiple cotton gins, two sawmills, and three gristmills. By 1890 there were 647 residents. An acre of land was granted for the construction of a public school on October 1, 1884. Kosse became an independent school district in 1893, with J. Thomas Hall as its first superintendent. The district had a total of 225 students. A separate school with 80 students and two teachers served the area's black community. On December 22, 1895, a fire burned seven brick buildings and destroyed the merchandise of seventeen firms, causing a loss of $75,000 of which only $30,000 was insured.  Early 20th Century  By the turn of the 20th century, Kosse had emerged as a small but stable regional community that supported the surrounding farms and ranches of southern Limestone County. Downtown Kosse in November 1899 Kosse was home to 700 residents in 1914. A local Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1921. In 1922, discovery of oil by wildcatter A. E. Humphreys dramatically transformed Kosse into a temporary oil boom town with thousands of new residents. However, the numerous wells drilled around Kosse did not turn out to be producers, and Kosse's oil boom came to a rapid close early in 1923. The Great Depression severely impacted Kosse as businesses closed and people left in search of greater employment opportunities. Declining student enrollment caused the Kosse School Board to vote in favor of consolidation with Groesbeck in 1968. Kosse had eleven businesses in 1989.

Mexia-Groesbeck gas oil field geologic map Mexia was founded as a town in the 19th century. Inhabitants occupied the Fort Parker settlement near the Navasota river. The area is near where the rolling hills of the great plains begin. The hills provided grazing land for the buffalo herds, which plains Indians depended upon for sustenance. Many hunting artifacts from Native American people have been found in the creek beds and draws around Mexia. The Comanche tribe came into conflict with the white settlers in this area. The abduction of Cynthia Ann Parker took place at Fort Parker. Comanches raided the fort and took the nine-year-old Parker girl. She lived among the Comanche people into adulthood and was the mother of Quanah Parker, the last Comanche war chief. Mexia is at the intersection of US Highway 84 and State highways 14 and 171, twelve miles northeast of Groesbeck in northeastern Limestone County. It was named for the Mex√≠a family, who in 1833 received an eleven-league land grant that included what is now the townsite. The town was laid out in 1870 by a trustee of the Houston and Texas Central Townsite Company, which offered lots for sale in 1871, as the Houston and Texas Central Railway was completed between Hearne and Groesbeck. The Mexia post office began operation in 1872, and the community was incorporated with a mayoral form of government in 1873 by an act of the legislature. J.C. Yarbro was the first mayor. The city's first newspaper, the Ledger, was established in Fairfield in 1869 and moved to Mexia in 1872. By 1880 Mexia also had four schools, three churches, and a variety of businesses to serve its 1,800 residents; by 1885 the town had a gas works, an opera house, two banks, two sawmills, and 2,000 residents. The Mexia Democrat was established in 1887 and the Weekly News in 1898. Between 1904 and 1906 the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway built track between Hillsboro and Houston, making Mexia a commercial crossroads for area farmers. In 1912 the Mexia Gas and Oil Company drilled ten dry holes, but in the eleventh attempt discovered a large natural gas deposit. The Mexia oilfield was discovered in 1920, by Colonel Albert E. Humphreys and his geologist F. Julius Fohs. Oil production peaked in November 1921 at 53,000 BOPD. The population of Mexia increased from 3,482 to nearly 35,000. The rapid growth was excessive for local authorities, and for a short time in 1922 Mexia was under martial law. That year, production for the Mexia field was 35 million barrels produced. Cumulative production of the field totaled 108 million barrels by the mid-1980s. In 1924 Mexia residents passed a new city charter that changed the local government to a city manager system. After the initial oil boom, the population of Mexia declined to 10,000 by the mid-1920s. The prosperity generated by the boom continued until the 1930s, when the Great Depression forced many people to leave in search of work. The number of residents stabilized at 6,500 in the early 1930s, but the number of businesses fell from 280 to 190. In 1942 a camp for prisoners of war was established at Mexia; the facility was converted in 1947 for use as the Mexia State School, which became one of the community's principal employers. The population was reported as 6,618 in the early 1950s, 5,943 in the early 1970s, 7,172 in the late 1980s, and 6,933 in 1990. In 2000 the population was listed as 6,563. Mexia made national news in 1981, when three young black men drowned in Lake Mexia after being taken into custody by law enforcement officers for possession of marijuana during the annual Juneteenth celebration. Carl Baker, 19; Anthony Freeman, 18; and Steven Booker, 19; drowned after a boat used to transport them across the lake, which was also occupied by three officers, capsized less than 100 feet from shore. Initial reports were that the three men had been handcuffed but those reports were unfounded. (Citation not appropriate - see Discussion) Two police officers and one probation officer who had been in the boat were tried for the offense of criminally negligent homicide, but all were acquitted by a jury in Dallas. Mexia also made news when its former resident Anna Nicole Smith died, and when Allen Stanford was arrested on allegations of fraud in 2009. The city of Mexia, the confusion over its correct pronunciation and the city motto are all the subject of an Act 1 Aria in Mark-Anthony Turnage's Opera Anna Nicole staged by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.

History Buck West House in George West is also the chamber of commerce welcoming center George West was a land venture and ranching enterprise of George Washington West and Kittie West. Originally from Shannonville Tennessee, West began to build his town in 1913, after ranching from 1880 to 1912 in the area between Pleasanton and Corpus Christi. He sold his cattle holdings and began to colonize some . West offered the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad $100,000 and a free easement through his land to build to George West. West had made his fortune on cattle drives but knew that the future rested with the transport of the animals on a train. He purchased some 120,000 acres in Live Oak County and held 26,000 cattle. A drought had caused such losses that he sold half of his acreage. Other ranchers tried to sell property at that time, and prices dropped to low levels. In 1918, West offered $75,000 to build a new courthouse if the county seat was moved from Oakville, which was not on a railroad route, and if voters approved the plan. The courthouse actually cost $120,000 and was built to West's specifications. He also built schools, roads, and water and electricity plants.

The population was 1,848 at the 2010 census. History Mrs. Annie T. Hamilton of Cuero owned a tract of land in the Brush Country where Three Rivers now sits. At the urging of Mrs. Hamilton, Charles R. Tips came to the Brush Country. In 1913, Mrs. Hamilton paid the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad to build a depot on her land. Tips organized a townsite company and sold land for the township. On July 4, 1913 the town began with a grand opening and first sale of land. From its formation, it was designed as a segregated township, with the \\"Mexican\\" section located between the river and the railroad tracks, west of the business section. This can still be seen today in the differences of street names, even though forced segregation ended many decades past. The city is named for its proximity to three rivers, the Atascosa River, the Frio River, and the Nueces River (the Atascosa joins the Frio north of the city, while the Frio joins the Nueces south of the city). Originally named Hamiltonburg, the city name was changed when mail meant for the city was accidentally delivered to Hamilton, Texas instead. Tips suggested the town be named for its location near the rivers, and Three Rivers was approved as the new name by the post office department on May 1, 1914. Three Rivers was incorporated in 1926 and operates under the general-law aldermanic form of government. In 1925 its population was estimated at 1,000, in 1931 at 1,275, and in 1965 at 1,932, with seventy businesses. The Felix Longoria Texas Historical Marker In 1920 natural gas was discovered near Three Rivers and was piped into town and a small refinery was built. The first glass factory in Texas was built at Three Rivers in 1922 as the gas fuel and local sand was plentiful. The onset of the Great Depression forced the sale of the factory to the Ball Glass Company in 1937, and the factory was permanently closed in 1938. The small refinery, however, expanded over time to become a major Diamond Shamrock refinery by 1990 and still is a major employer in the town to this day. In 1948-49 the city of Three Rivers gained notoriety as the location of what has become known as the \\"Longoria Affair\\" when the director of the only funeral home in town refused to allow chapel services in 1948 for the body of a \\"Mexican-American\\" Soldier killed during World War II in 1945. The installation of a Texas Historical Marker at the site of the funeral home came with controversy. The new owners of the property asked that the marker not be returned after it was repaired, so it was rededicated and installed in the town square at the entrance to city hall.

Economic base The predominant economic drivers for Three Rivers, Texas, are oil and gas exploration, refining, ranching, and hunting. Tourism is on the rise due to the gateway to the Choke Canyon Reservoir through Three Rivers. Choke Canyon State Park offers boating, fishing, camping, educational services, and wildlife viewing. The bird migratory routes bring over two hundred different species to the Three Rivers area, making it a national destination for bird watching. Accommodations for visitors are plentiful with hotels and many RV (recreational vehicle) parks. Many of these were built to accommodate workers during the recent Eagle Ford oil boom. Three Rivers is also the site of the historic first glass factory in the State of Texas. Although it is no longer in production and the building has been demolished, a state historical marker stands at its site. Some of the antique shops in town and in the neighboring county seat of George West may sometimes carry a few pieces the factory produced. Many Three Rivers residents live in or near Three Rivers because of the large number of jobs needed in the nearby Federal Bureau of Prisons located roughly 10 miles west of town, on Hwy 72. The Valero Three Rivers Refinery located inside the city limits, is another major employer. With the recent 'fracking' surge in the area, Three Rivers is centrally located in the middle of a large field that extends over a three county area.

Llano County was established in compliance with a February 1, 1856, state legislative act. The Llano River location was chosen in an election held on June 14, 1856, under a live oak on the south bank of the river, near the present site of Roy Inks Bridge in Llano. Into the 1870s, the town was little more than a frontier trading center, with a few log buildings housing business establishments, a post office, and a few homes. In 1879, the first bank, Moore, Foster, and Company, was founded, and during the 1880s, Llano acquired a number of new enterprises that served the county's farmers and ranchers. After the county outgrew the one-story stone building that had housed its public offices, in 1885, an ornate brick courthouse was completed on the square on the south side of the river. A fire on January 22, 1892, destroyed this courthouse; the present county courthouse was completed and occupied on August 1, 1893. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1880s the Llano Rural, the town's first newspaper, was established, followed by the Iron City News, the name of which reflects growing interest in the county's mineral resources. The Rural eventually incorporated several other newspapers, including the Advocate, the Searchlight, and the Gazette, to become the Llano News by the early 1900s. The Llano Times was where J. Marvin Hunter, author and historian of the American West, worked on the staff for a brief time early in the 20th century. Anticipation of significant economic growth based on the iron deposits discovered at Iron Mountain in northwestern Llano County attracted capital from Dallas and from northern states, and the boom years of Llano-from 1886 to 1893-were launched. The Llano Improvement and Furnace Company undertook plans for an iron furnace and foundry, as well as for the development of commercial real estate, on the hitherto undeveloped north side of the river. Charters were undertaken for a dam, an electric power plant, a streetcar system, and electric street lights, while expectations of growth were high. Steel-town names such as Birmingham, Pittsburgh, and Bessemer were chosen for streets on the north side; Llano was to be the \\"Pittsburgh of the West\\", but only a small dam and the street lighting were completed. By one report, the population reached 7,000 in 1890. In 1892, at the peak of the boom period, the town was incorporated, the river was bridged, and the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was extended to a terminal on the north side of Llano. Because of the improved transportation, several granite cutting and finishing businesses moved to town in this period. Many of the new businesses were begun in the boom period, and substantial brick establishments were constructed around the public square on the north side of the river. Among these, the Algona Hotel became a focal point for the town's new social life. It was damaged by a cyclone in 1900 and burned to the ground in 1923. Because the county's mineral resources, with the significant exception of granite, did not exist in commercially exploitable concentrations, the boom period soon faded. Plans to connect Llano with Fredericksburg via an extension of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway were not fulfilled. A series of fires in the early 1890s, probably set to collect insurance on unprofitable properties, destroyed many of the new business establishments. Such fires were so numerous, fire insurance was denied to the town for several years. Farming, ranching, and the granite industry remained the foundations of the town's economy in the 20th century. In the 1920s, Llano was a major shipping point for cattle; the cotton industry flourished in the county through the 1930s, but declined thereafter into insignificance. Granite quarrying and finishing retained their importance, amounting to a million-dollar-a-year industry by the 1950s. The Roy Inks Bridge, named for a former mayor, was built after a flood crest of 42 feet in 1935 swept away the 1892 structure. By 1964, the town had a new hospital, a post office, school buildings, a community center, a rodeo area, and a golf course, along with a city park and improved water system. Llano was an important link in the Highland Lakes chain of tourist areas, and attracted many hunters during the deer season. A winery, feed processing, and insecticide and commercial talc production represented new industry. Actress Sophia Loren, friend and correspondent of Netherlands native Anthony Goossens, priest of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Llano, contributed to the church fund-raising campaign in 1975. By 1983, the National Register of Historic Places listed, in addition to the courthouse, the Llano jail, the Southern Hotel, and the Badu Building, former bank and home of French immigrant and mineralogist N. J. Badu, now a bed-and-breakfast establishment. 2018 flood In October 2018, Llano experienced heavy rainfall and flooding following Hurricane Sergio. Rainfall in Llano exceeded and the sea level of Llano River rose about in 12 hours. The body of an unidentified woman was found on the banks alongside the Colorado River following the flooding in Llano.

The population was 794 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lubbock Metropolitan Statistical Area. History New Deal was originally known as Monroe, named for Monroe G. Abernathy, a local landowner. The town was originally developed as a train station loading site. People began to settle there and that is why the town was built alongside the railroad tracks and highway. The train identification name for the township still reads Monroe alongside the railroad tracks. Some time afterward the town wanted a post office and requested the permit for the Monroe Postal Station. Because there was already a town in Texas with the name Monroe City, the U.S. postal department changed the name of the town to New Deal after Franklin D. Roosevelt's programs and to go along with the consolidated school system's name. This information was all developed when the school system had to write a history when applying for a federal grant. In 1970, the township was incorporated by the vote of its citizens. The city of Lubbock, Texas, was planning some annexation of surrounding lands and the people of the New Deal area decided to incorporate rather than be annexed to the city of Lubbock. A local farmer, Billy Fortenberry, was the first mayor. In 1970, Ray Edell West, a city councilman for three years, became the mayor.

Bruno Jr. (1945-2008) was a sculptor and inventor who was born in Los Angeles in 1945, Robert grew up in Mexico and the United States before attending Dominican College in Racine, Wisconsin and graduate school at the University of Notre Dame. He moved to Lubbock in 1971 to teach art at Texas Tech University's school of architecture. He started working on The Steel House in 1973, two years after sculpting a similar piece of art, (now a permanent installation in front of the TTU School of Architecture) which inspired him to build something bigger to live in.

(Jim) Bowles, whose ranch was adjacent to the site of what is now Shallowater, persuaded Bob Crump, a member of a ranching family, to help form a townsite company and attract a railroad to go through the area. Land was purchased for the townsite on May 18, 1909. A school was built at that time. After Santa Fe railroad officials received a bonus from rancher George W. Littlefield of the Yellow House Ranch, negotiations were finally completed. The originators of the plan, and other interested individuals, formed the Ripley Townsite Company, which was named after a Santa Fe railroad official and was incorporated on May 22, 1909. The company decided to name the new town Shallowater to attract settlers. On June 26, 1913, a celebration was held to note the founding of the town and completion of the railroad. By the time the town was established, the ranching industry in the area was waning and many of the large ranches were being divided into smaller lots for farmers. Cotton became an important cash crop. During the 1920s, Shallowater grew rapidly, and the town had a hotel, a lumberyard, and various filling stations, grocery stores, cotton gins, drugstores, barbershops, garages, blacksmith shops, and other businesses. Several churches and schools were also built. A county park with a clubhouse was established, a public well was constructed, and a real depot building was built to replace the boxcar the town had been using for years. From 1920 to 1922, the railroad station was known as Pacita. In 1928, the town had an estimated population of 250. In 1955, Shallowater was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government, and during the 1960s, the town had five churches, a school, a bank, a library, and a newspaper. The community in 1970 had 30 businesses, including one of the largest hatcheries in the county. The population of Shallowater was 1,001 in 1960 and 1,339 in 1970. In the late 1980s, Shallowater had a post office, 17 businesses, and a population of 2,107. It was a farm marketing center with processing and storing facilities. In 2010, the population was 2,484.

Arts and culture=Harvey House of Slaton In 1912, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad, through reorganization now the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, opened a depot in Slaton. Until 1969, the train station offered passengers meals and hospitality through the Fred Harvey Company. The company advertised for \\"Young women, 18 to 30 years of age, of good moral character, attractive and intelligent, as waitresses in the Havey Eating Houses on the Santa Fe Railroad in the West.\\"Sheila Wood Foard, Harvey Girl, Lubbock: Texas Tech University Press, 2006 Other ATSF depots were in Amarillo, Brownwood, Gainesville, Temple, and El Paso, Texas, and in Clovis, New Mexico. After the passenger service ended, the railroad used the depot, located at 400 Railroad Avenue, for offices, training rooms, train crew-staging areas, and storage, but abandoned the building in the late 1980s. The railroad still passes by the depot. The remaining structure, known as the Harvey House, was marked for demolition, but a citizens' committee launched a nearly two-decade effort to preserve and restore it. The former depot, which calls itself \\"The Jewel on the Plains\\", can be rented for parties with catered meals and occasional entertainment options. The upstairs area, which was the living quarters of the Harvey girls' when it was a restaurant in the early 20th century, is now a fully operational bed and breakfast. The downstairs area hosts a small railroad collection museum. The West Texas Historical Association toured the Harvey House during its 2009 annual meeting in Lubbock.

Wilson is a small rural city in the northeastern quadrant of Lynn County, Texas, United States. History The town of Wilson was established in 1912 by William Dickson Green of Shiner, Texas, and Lonnie Lumsden. Early settlers included German and Polish emigrant farmers who acquired property on former Wilson County School lands located in Lynn County, hence the city's name. Wilson was founded in anticipation that the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway would lay tracks through the area. The Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company was one of the two major operating subsidiaries of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) in Texas, with lines crossing the Texas Panhandle and South Plains regions, as well as a line across the Trans-Pecos to Presidio. A branch line between Slaton Junction and Lamesa was constructed in 1911, and this line would pass directly through Wilson. In 1917, William Green built the \\"Green Building\\" that housed a mercantile store that quickly became the center of activity in this small town. The couple most involved in operating the store were Mr. and Mrs. J.T. Williams, who managed the store from 1916 to 1936, when Mr. Williams died. Mrs. Williams continued to manage the store for another few years until the early 1940s. In 1963, the citizens of Wilson celebrated the renovation of the Green Building, and today, the refurbished building serves as the city hall and historical museum, and continues to be a community gathering spot. In 1923, Wilson, with only 20 residents, was among 37 communities that applied to become the home of the new Texas Technological College, which was instead located to the north in Lubbock. Wilson offered the choice of 6000 acres for the institution, three times the amount required in the legislation authored by State Senator William H. Bledsoe of Lubbock, whose district included Lynn County.

Wednesday, October 12, 2011. 2. Retrieved on October 17, 2011. Early records indicate that Jefferson was founded around 1841 on land ceded from the Caddo Indians. At that time, a log jam more than 100 miles long existed on the Red River north of present Natchitoches, Louisiana. The Indians said that this log jam, known as the Great Red River Raft, had always existed. The Red River Raft (or Great Raft) acted as a dam on the river and raised the level of Caddo Lake and the Red River several feet. This rise of Caddo Lake and the corresponding rise in the Big Cypress Bayou at Jefferson permitted commercial riverboat travel to Jefferson from ports such as St. Louis and New Orleans via the Mississippi and Red Rivers. Panoramic map of Jefferson in 1872 by Herman Brosius including a list oflandmarks Jefferson was one of the most important ports in Texas between 1845 and 1872. The town reached its peak population just a few years after the Civil War and is reported to have exceeded 30,000. During this time, Jefferson was the sixth-largest town in Texas. There were attempts over the years to remove the raft and permit the normal flow of the Red River, but these attempts were unsuccessful until the discovery of nitroglycerin. In 1873, using nitroglycerin, the Army Corps of Engineers was finally able to clear the raft from the Red River. This lowered the level of Caddo Lake and Big Cypress to the extent that riverboat traffic to Jefferson was no longer commercially feasible. At the peak of river traffic, Jefferson had a population of over 7,000. A few years later, it had dropped to a little over 3,000. The Sterne Fountain was given to the city in 1913 to honor the contribution of Jacob and Ernestine Sterne, a Jewish couple who settled in Jefferson before the Civil War and became prominent citizens who managed the post office and were involved in numerous civic and cultural projects. The fountain includes a statue of Hebe, the Greek goddess of Youth, by Giuseppe Moretti. One of the legends related to Jefferson referred to Jay Gould, the railroad magnate. The legend goes that Gould wanted to bring his railroad through Jefferson but the town leaders refused because they had the river traffic. Gould said that \\"grass would grow in the streets\\" without the railroad. Gould credited with supporting the removal of the Red River Raft and the subsequent decline of Jefferson as a river port. Much of this tale is fiction. Townspeople obtained Gould's railcar and it is displayed as a tourist attraction in downtown Jefferson.Jefferson, Riverport to the Southwest, by Fred Tarpley, 1983.

History The first settler is thought to have been Peter S. Parker in 1846. The settlement of Mason grew up around Fort Mason, which was established by the United States War Department as a front-line defense against Kiowa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche, on July 6, 1851. George W. Todd established a Fort Mason post office March 8, 1858, which became consigned to the civilian settlement on June 26, 1858.Jim Wheat The protection and commercial possibilities of the fort drew settlers. W. C. Lewis opened a general store that served soldiers and settlers. In 1860, James E. Ranck opened a second store and later became known as \\"The Father of Mason\\". Ben F.

Mason was voted the county seat in 1861 After the U.S. Civil War, returning Confederate veterans and German ranchers clashed in 1875 over cattle rustling and other crimes. The resulting killings were known as the \\"HooDoo Wars\\". In the midst of the war, Loyal Valley homeowner Tim Williamson was murdered by a dozen masked vigilantes, who accused him of cattle theft. Williamson's adopted son, Texas Ranger Scott Cooley, sought revenge. Cooley and his desperadoes, which included Johnny Ringo, created a reign of terror over the area. During this episode, Ringo committed his first murder, that of James Cheyney. TexFiles The first courthouse and jail were built in 1869 of stone walls lined with post oak timbers. After the Hoo Doo War, a new two-story red sandstone jail was built in 1898 by L.T. Noyes of Houston. Noyes was a contractor with Diebold Safe and Lock Company. A new courthouse was built in 1875, which burned down in 1877 destroying some county records. However, many documents were saved and can be viewed inside the current courthouse vaults. The 1878 courthouse was destroyed in 1900. The current granite courthouse was erected in 1909 by architect E. H. Hosford and Co. in the Classic Revival style. On October 3, 1918, 18 months after United States Congress declared war on Germany, the Mason County Council of Defense drew up resolution to abandon the use of the German language in the county. Most county residents are of German heritage. The Broad Street Bridge, a reinforced concrete truss and the only one of its kind in Texas, was built across the Comanche Creek in 1918. The span is 102 ft long and composed of two 51-ft spans supported by concrete abutments with a pier at the center.

The population was 4,718 at the 2010 census. Etymology Popular local legend states that the area was named Tres Palacios (\\"Three Palaces\\") several centuries ago by shipwrecked Spanish sailors who claimed they saw a vision of three palaces on the bay. Historians believe it was more likely named for Jos√© F√©lix Trespalacios, an early Mexican governor of Texas. The town was originally called Trespalacios, but shortened its name due to a nearby post office already using the longer version.Mary L. Griffin, \\"PALACIOS, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hfp01), accessed May 03, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. History The native inhabitants of the region were the Karankawa people, whose initial contact with Europeans came in the 16th century when Spanish expeditions first traversed their territory. In 1685, the area was explored by Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the leader of an ill-fated French settlement attempt whose flagship La Belle was wrecked in the bay the following year.http://www.visitbaycity.org/history/index.html Historic Matagorda County In the 1820s, English-speaking settlers arrived and came into frequent conflict with the Karankawa, who were eventually driven out of the area.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmk05 Handbook of Texas Online \\"Karankawa Indians\\" The future site of Palacios was ranch land until 1901, when it was put up for sale by the estate of the former owner, Abel \\"Shanghai\\" Pierce. The land was purchased by a development company, surveyed into lots, and with the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the establishment of the Texas Baptist Encampment, it rapidly grew into a seaside resort town. It was first settled as a community in 1903.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer p. 1413 City government was established in 1909, and by 1915, Palacios was home to more than 100 businesses, with a post office, library, weekly newspaper, numerous hotels, and churches, as well as a large entertainment pavilion built on a pier in the bay.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hfp01 Handbook of Texas Online In 1926, Camp Hulen (originally \\"Camp Palacios\\") was opened as a training center for the 36th Infantry of the Texas National Guard.

History When the area was settled in the 1870s, the community was named Brady City after Brady Creek, which runs through town. The name was shortened to Brady when the town was incorporated in 1906. In 1787‚Äì88, Spanish explorer Jos√© Mares crossed the creek near the site of present Brady. Henry and Nancy Fulcher, the first settlers on Brady Creek, donated land for the townsite in the mid-1870s. Allison Ogden and his father-in-law, Ben Henton, built a store in 1875. A post office opened in 1876. After residents of McCulloch County chose Brady as county seat on May 15, 1876, the town grew fairly quickly. Brady had about 50 residents in 1877, and a stone courthouse was completed in 1878. Thomas Maples began weekly publication of The Brady Sentinel in 1880; by 1884, Brady had two churches, a district school, three stores, two hotels, and 300 residents. Stock raising was the primary occupation in the Brady area before 1900. In the 1870s and 1880s, local ranchers drove their cattle to markets in Kansas. Most other trade was with Brownwood and Lampasas. The number of farms and fences increased with the influx of immigrants in the late 1880s and 1890s. Poultry, sheep, goats, cotton, and pecans joined cattle as important sources of income for area residents. When the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway arrived in 1903, Brady became a principal shipping point for Central Texas. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe came to Brady in 1912. By 1914, the town had grown to include four churches, two schools, two banks, several processing plants, manufacturing and supply outlets, and 2,669 residents. In 1926, Brady residents celebrated the building of 42-acre Richards Park by holding a two-day barbecue on the Fourth of July weekend; it was such a success that the celebration was labeled the \\"July Jubilee\\" and became an annual event. Curtis Field opened just north of Brady in 1942 as a pilot-training school. Also during World War II, a German prisoner-of-war camp was built 3 miles east of the town; it housed more than 300 Germans, most of them members of Rommel's Afrika Korps. Brady grew slowly from the 1920s through the 1950s, with population estimates reaching a peak of 6,800 in 1958. In 1959, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway abandoned the section of track between Brownwood and Brady, thereby reducing Brady's access to outside markets. The population fell to 5,338 by 1961, and subsequently stabilized. Brady Reservoir was completed in 1963 for flood control, municipal and industrial water needs, and recreation. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe abandoned the track between Brady and Eden in 1972, leaving the town with only a branch track to connect it with the main line at Lometa, in Lampasas County. Brady had 5,925 residents and 142 businesses in 1988. It was principally a farming and ranching community. Its industry included a mohair-combing plant and sand-mining operations. The Francis King Art Gallery and Museum houses works by King, a painter and sculptor, and a collection of restored antique cars. The stone courthouse, built in 1900, was renovated in 2009. A horse racetrack, G. Rollie White Downs, opened in 1989 and closed in 1990. Brady's population in 1990 was 5,946, but dropped to 5,528 in 2010.

Lorena acquired national attention at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia, where the keynote address was delivered by Ann Richards, state treasurer and later Governor. As she called for the election of Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas as President and Vice President of the United States, Richards read a letter from an unnamed young mother in Lorena who described herself as \\"forgotten\\" by the national leadership. According to Richards, the woman wrote: > \\"Our worries go from pay day to pay day, just like millions of others.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,807. It is named after T.M. West, the first postmaster of the city. The city is located in the north-central part of Texas, approximately south of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, 20 miles north of Waco and 120 miles north of Austin, the state's capital. Despite its name, the city is not located within the region of West Texas; area residents sometimes call the community \\"West comma Texas\\" to avoid repetition. it has one of the largest concentrations of Czech Texans of any city in the state. History The first settlers of northern McLennan County arrived in the 1840s. They were farm and ranch families drawn from the east by the rich lands made available by the government sale of land to build schools in Texas. The area farmers cultivated the land and grew cotton, wheat, and grain sorghum, and raised cattle. The farming community centered around a freshwater spring that became known as Bold Springs. In 1860, Bold Springs had a population of about 300 and provided services such as a blacksmith, churches, and a post office. The Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad was laid between Hillsboro and Waco in the fall of 1881. The path of the railroad passed through land owned by Thomas West, who had moved to the area in 1859. He farmed land that he had purchased and served as postmaster of Bold Springs. A train depot was built on the land he sold to the railroad company and the land running beside the tracks was divided into small sections and sold to people wanting to start businesses. The new depot included a post office, and from that time forward it was known as the West Post Office. Mr. West served as postmaster and opened the first general store. He became a successful businessman and later owned a hotel, a furniture store, and a bank. The railroad brought prosperity to the area during the 1880s. More businesses were opened and more surrounding land was purchased. Czech immigrants came to the area, purchasing the rich lands to farm and start a fresh life in the new world. They also opened businesses, sharing their European culture. By the 1890s, the Czech businesses flourished in West. On June 11, 1892, West was officially organized into a town. It had become the center of commerce for the area. There were cotton gins, grocery stores, churches, schools, and doctors' offices. The temporary city Crush, Texas, located just three miles (5 km) south of West, was the location of The Crash at Crush, a head-on collision between two locomotives that was staged on September 15, 1896, as a publicity stunt for the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad. Over 30,000 spectators gathered at the crash site, named \\"crush\\" for MKT passenger agent William Crush, who conceived the idea. About 4 p.m. the trains were sent speeding toward each other. Contrary to mechanics' predictions, the steam boilers exploded on impact, propelling pieces of metal into the crowd. Two people were killed and many others injured, including Jarvis Deane of Waco, who was photographing the event and lost an eye. Texas Historical Marker 5315, located on Interstate 35 northbound frontage road, between Mangrum and Wiggins Road, commemorates the event. The turn of the century brought electricity, running water, and natural gas. The population of West and surrounding area grew. Many of the descendants of the original settlers continue to farm the lands and run the businesses today. Czech is still spoken by some of the older residents. 2013 explosion On April 17, 2013, a fire broke out at West Fertilizer Co., a fertilizer plant on the north side of town that stored ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used as an explosive. The fire triggered two explosions milliseconds apart from one another. The massive blast killed 15 people, including 12 first responders, and injured at least 200. It destroyed nearby schools, an apartment complex, and a nursing home and damaged hundreds of homes in the surrounding area. The explosion, which measured as a 2.1 magnitude earthquake, garnered much media attention. President Barack Obama and Texas Gov. Rick Perry attended the memorial for first responders. A month-long investigation ruled the cause of the explosion undetermined because multiple possible causes could not be ruled out. The lingering possibilities include arson, an electrical glitch or a golf cart that overheated. It was later concluded that the reason for the April 17, 2013 blast was a fire that accidentally ignited inside, causing the fertilizer plant to explode. In 2016 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives concluded that the fire that caused the explosion was set deliberately.The Guardian, May 11, 2016 explosion criminal act However ATF never presented any evidence of arson. A comprehensive investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) publiced in 2016 did not find any evidence of foul play.

The population was 2,680 at the 2010 census. Prior to 1893, Castroville was the first county seat of Medina County. Castroville is known for its influential Alsatian-Texan architecture, people, and culture. Most Alsatians that came to Castroville spoke Alsatian (a dialect of German origin integrating Celtic, Yiddish, and French words). To say Castroville is purely French would not be true, because it has a long history of Alsatian culture and language kept alive by its residents as well. History Castroville was established in 1844 by Henri Castro, an empresario of the Republic of Texas, who brought several dozen European families to the area from Alsace and adjoining Baden to populate his land grant along the Medina River west of San Antonio. The first colonists disembarked at Galveston on January 9, 1843. They were taken by ship to Lavaca Bay and traveled overland to San Antonio, where they took shelter in abandoned buildings until the Texas Rangers were prepared to escort them to their land and protect them from hostile Indians. On September 2, 1844, the first colonists arrived at Castro's land grant on the Medina River. From 1849, Castroville, on the Medina River was a water stop on the San Antonio-El Paso Road and a stagecoach station on the San Antonio-El Paso Mail Line and San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line. After a few hard years, the town and surrounding farms flourished; although for generations, the residents remained insular. In Castroville's first century, a visitor would be more likely to hear Alsatian‚Äîa dialect spoken in Europe before Standard German was prevalent‚Äîthan English spoken in the town's homes, stores, and taverns. Modern Alsatian travelers noted that the dialect spoken in Castroville was more like that which was spoken in the 1840s. The descendants of the original settlers worked diligently to preserve their language, whose usage in Europe has been diminished by the political actions of France and Germany, especially since World War II. The Steinbach Haus (originally built between 1618 and 1648 in Wahlbach, Alsace) was dismantled and reconstructed in Castroville in 1998. It was opened to the public in 2002.

Hondo was mentioned in Season 2 Episode 13 of The Night Shift and described as \\" a two stoplight town down I-90\\". History Original inhabitants of the area, now Medina County, were the Coahuiltecan people. Non- indigenous settlers to the area came from Alsace-Lorraine, Germany, Belgium and Mexico. Many family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches are still owned by descendants of the non-indigenous families. The first Spaniard to explore the area was Cabeza de Vaca in the early 1530s, some 40 years after Columbus arrived in the New World. The city of Hondo was first settled in 1881 and incorporated in 1942. Hondo was the scene of two bank robberies in the early 1920s. The crooks were the famed Newton Gang, the most successful outlaws in U.S. history. Both bank heists occurred the same night. In 1930, the local Hondo Lions Club erected the now somewhat famous sign reading \\"This is God's Country, Don't Drive Thru It Like Hell\\" at the city limits with the intention of slowing down those speeding while traveling through town. Later, in the 1940s the sign was changed to \\"This is God's Country, Please Don't Drive Through It Like Hell\\" to satisfy those in the town who were displeased with the tone of the old sign. The sign has been in news and print in many magazines, including on the cover of National Geographic, and in the music video of Little Texas' song \\"God Blessed Texas.\\" The U.S. Army built an air field in the town in 1942 to train new pilots; at one time the largest air navigation school in the world, Hondo Army Airfield trained over 14,000 navigators for service during World War II before closing in 1946.

It is situated along the banks of the San Saba River at the junction of U.S. Highways 83 and 190, about 140 miles northwest of Austin and San Antonio in central Menard County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History The first settlement at the site of what is now Menard was the Spanish Mission San Sab√° and the Presidio of San Lu√≠s de Amarillas, both established in April 1757. The presidio was later replaced by the Presidio of San Sab√° in 1761. Both were intended to protect New Spain's northern frontier from marauding Comanches. Due to the presidio's isolation, it suffered repeated attacks, and was finally abandoned in 1770. Stones from the old presidio walls were used by later settlers to build homes and fences. The ruins of the old presidio were reconstructed in 1936.Moorehead. The Presidio: Bastion of the Spanish Borderlands. Pp. 53, 60, 65, 69-73, 80, 90, 166-173, 199 The community was first known as Menardville when the site was laid out in 1858, after the formation of Menard County. Nearby Fort McKavett was deactivated in 1859, leaving the settlers with little protection from frequent Indian raids. The fort reopened after the Civil War. By 1867, Menardville had a store, a blacksmith shop, and a saloon. The community served as a trading post and overnight stop on north and west cattle trails. A county government was organized in 1871 and a two-story courthouse was built one year later. Menardville had around 150 residents by the mid-1880s. The San Saba River flooded in 1899, causing considerable damage to the community. In 1910 or 1911, while the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Company was making plans to lay a track through the community, company officials asked residents to rename their town Menard to facilitate the painting of signs. An economic boom followed the arrival of the first train in 1911. The 1920 census recorded 1,164 people living in Menard. For many years, the town served as the principal shipping point for Menard County. Although the community was affected by the Great Depression, both of its banks ‚Äì the Menard National Bank and Bevans State Bank ‚Äì remained open. Menard's population stood at 1,969 in 1930, 2,375 in 1940, and 2,685 in 1950. That figure began to decline during the 1950s and 1960s, as road improvements made travel and shipping less dependent on rail service. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad discontinued its service to Menard in 1972, but donated the depot to the county for use as a history museum. The Menard County Historical Society began collecting artifacts in 1975 and dedicated the museum in 1978. By 1980, 1,697 people were living in Menard. In 1990, the population fell slightly to 1,606 before rebounding to 1,653 in 2000. Demographics As of the census of 2000, 1,653 people, 666 households, and 438 families resided in the city.

The population was 5,770 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Milam County. Geography Cameron is located at (30.854544, -96.978716). It is situated at the junction of U.S. Highways 77 and 190, about 71 miles northeast of Austin in north- central Milam County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History=Early years Soon after Texas became a U.S. State, the Texas Legislature authorized a seven-member commission to find a permanent site for the Milam County seat. The commission purchased a 60-acre tract of Daniel Monroe's headright on the Little River in 1846 and named the new community Cameron after Ewen Cameron, a Scottish highlander prominent in the Texas Revolution and a member of the Mier Expedition during the war with Mexico. When the courthouse in Cameron was completed later that year, county records were transferred to Cameron from Nashville ‚Äì a community situated along the Brazos River that had served as the Milam County seat during the period when Texas was an independent republic. The new town struggled due to its isolated location with the nearest railroad being fifty miles away. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, several attempts were made to navigate the Little River in order to give Cameron easier access to trade routes. The most successful attempts occurred in 1850 after heavy rains made the river rise. J.W. McCown, Sr. persuaded Captain Basil M. Hatfield to bring his steamboat \\"Washington\\" through the upper Brazos up to the Little River. The steamboat and the merchandise it brought caused great excitement among the locals, and a two-day celebration was held when the boat tied up two-and-a-half miles east of Cameron. Despite this, however, navigation of the river was impractical on a regular basis and places such as Port Sullivan and Nashville developed into Milam County's dominant business centers during the 1850s and 1860s. More competition came in the 1870s when nearby Rockdale was established on the International-Great Northern Railroad. Faced with these challenges, some Milam County residents began to question whether Cameron should remain the county seat instead of the newly prosperous town of Rockdale. Elections were held in 1874 and 1880 on the issue with the results going in favor of maintaining the status quo. Incorporation and growth In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway arrived in Cameron. This improved the local economy and led to subsequent population growth. In the six-year period between 1878 and 1884, the total number of residents rose from around 500 to 800, an increase of sixty percent. Cameron had attempted to incorporate in 1856, 1866, and 1873, but each time the charter was allowed to lapse. It was officially incorporated in 1889. The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway arrived in 1890, giving the town another positive boost. By 1892, the population stood at nearly 2,000. Although cotton dominated the economy of Cameron during the 19th century, the 20th century brought more diversified industries. The discovery of oil in neighboring Williamson County in 1915 prompted Milam County residents to initiate their own exploration. The Minerva-Rockdale oil field was discovered in 1921 and provided new opportunities for investment. In the 1920s and 1930s, several milk product companies were operating in Cameron, including the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation. At the 1930 census, the population was 4,565. That figure rose to 5,040 in 1940. Modern times Cameron residents received much-needed job opportunities in the 1950s when the Aluminum Company of America built a plant southwest of Rockdale. Jobs at the plant, as well as the lignite industry that supplied the plant's power, revitalized the economy of Milam County. The plant closed in 2009. Between 1950 and 1960, Cameron registered an increase of 588 residents, from 5,052 to 5,640. This level of growth would not continue, however. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad discontinued its track from Cameron south to Giddings. Southern Pacific, which had taken over the Texas and New Orleans, abandoned its track from Cameron north to Rosebud. The population would continue to experience slight fluctuations throughout the remainder of the late 20th century. On May 27‚Äì31, 2010 a campground outside of Cameron hosted the Burning Flipside festival, which brought over 2400 campers through Cameron.

Its population was 428 at the time of the 2010 census, and, in July 2018, it was estimated at 427.

History The International-Great Northern Railroad Company laid out the original site of Milano in 1874, about a mile and a half west of the city's present site. A United States post office opened there the same year. Soon, a Baptist church was also established in the area. The community around Milano became a voting precinct in 1880. Hudson Store in Milano, Texas (c. 1900) Local sources offer several possibilities for the origin of the name \\"Milano.\\" One story suggests that the town was simply named after Milan, Italy, because of similarities in the climate, but truly, the climate of Milan in Northern Italy, is cold and continental; another says that the name was supposed to have been \\"Milam,\\" but the United States Post Office Department either got it wrong or changed it intentionally because another Milam, Texas, already existed. Nevertheless, when the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad Company built the section of track between Brenham and Belton in 1881, it established the town of Milano Junction at the railway's intersection with the International-Great Northern, about two miles east of Milano. As the focus of social and economic life shifted to the new town, Milano became \\"Old Milano\\" and Milano Junction became Milano. By the late 1880s, Milano was a commercial hub, with 500 residents, and served as a shipping point for cotton and hides produced in the area. Truck farming became an important industry for Milano in the 1920s, with tomatoes, watermelon, and cantaloupes as the principal crops. The small city of Milano reached its population peak in 1939, when approximately 920 residents were reported to be living there. The number of local residents began to decline in the early 1940s, and fell to a low of 380 by the early 1970s, before beginning to grow again in the late 1970s.
