The battle recorded over 8000 casualties, with many more wounded. However, many people have reported and told stories of seeing the soldiers of Gettysburg, or, in other words, seeing their ghosts. Most of the stories include the men battling each other on the field, as they did during the actual battle. Many believe that the ghosts are true, others don‚Äôt. Ghosts hunters Dave and Sharon Oester decided to see these ghosts for themselves, and described their discoveries in their book, The Ghosts of Gettysburg. As shown below, there have been many sightings, too many, in fact, to write about. However, one can visit the battlefield, and decide for themselves if they believe in these ghosts. From camera malfunctions on the battlefield to a tap on the shoulder, these ghosts will always remind us of what they did, and will never be forgotten.  Sightings of the Ghosts  There have been many sightings of ghosts. Sometimes, people have heard ghosts, and witnessed paranormal events in Gettysburg. One of them was outside General Robert E Lee‚Äôs headquarters, which is available to see now in Pennsylvania. Ghost hunters Dave and Sharon Oester brought a group of nurses to the Gettysburg battlefield, and what was witnessed next was both ‚Äúterrifying and incredible‚Äù, as both of the authors put it. Outside Lee‚Äôs headquarters, there are cannons that the group stood outside of. The hunters and the nurses took pictures of the cannons, where the fighting during the battle occurred. Eventually, one of the nurses said that they smelled blood, which was odd because there haven‚Äôt been fighting or blood-spilling events since the battle of Gettysburg. All of the nurses could smell blood, but no one else could. This was because they could smell old blood, which no one other than nurses could smell. If this event is true, then the only explanation that could explain what happened was that the blood of the old soldiers appeared on the battlefield, and for this to happen, their ‚Äúghosts‚Äù would have to be around somewhere. There are many other reports of similar events like this, but, to be sure, one would have to visit Gettysburg themselves, and decide, whether they believe in ghosts or not. In the Reynolds woods, near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a normal couple was on a stroll through the woods. They then decided to visit the battlefield, where they thought they saw reenactors reenacting the battle, waving a Confederate flag waving in the wind, however, when she investigated, there was no flag and there were no actors.2 The woman was recording her experience the entire time and decided to look at the recording to see what happened. When she watched the recording, she could hear soldiers giving military commands.2 This terrifying recording is only one example of the terrifying ghost stories and encounters that have been recorded around Gettysburg, and proves that something, paranormal or not, is happening there. Even if these ghosts are not real, they are constant reminder that the battle and the soldiers are not to be forgotten, and if sightings of ghosts continue, they will never be forgotten.  Conclusion  There are a great number of places around Gettysburg that are supposedly haunted. There are many reports of ghosts in places like the Gettysburg hotel, the Gettysburg mansion, Culp‚Äôs field, many hospitals, and the Virginia monument, and the ghost stories that are told from those places range from cameras not working to feeling taps on the shoulder to objects being misplaced.2 It is not known exactly when the first sighting of a ghost or paranormal activity in Gettysburg was, but their have been many reports documented, and even if some might not be real, they tell us that something eerie is happening in Gettysburg, whether it be ghosts or simply mysterious followers of the battle. Real or not, they will forever be in our heads, and will always be remembered for what they did in Gettysburg.2  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Oester, Dave and Sharon. ‚ÄúGhosts of Gettysburg.‚Äù Google Books,  Further Reading, ‚ÄúThe Ghosts of Gettysburg‚Äù  Ghost Hunters Dave and Sharon record that most of the Gettysburg Ghosts range from nurses in the war to soldiers fighting. In their book, ‚ÄúThe Ghosts of Gettysburg‚Äù, Dave and Sharon Oester explore multiple sites of the war and record multiple heart stopping encounters with what they say is paranormal activity. For one who wants to read about their experiences and learn more about these ghosts, they should read the Oester‚Äôs book. For one who wants to experience the strange activity themselves, Gettysburg is a great place to go and explore.

Historians have given a variety of dates for Wulgrin's ascension to the countship. Watson (453) gives it as 1179, backed up by charter evidence (353‚Äì62). Geoffrey of Vigeois' chronicle (325‚Äì26) also declares William VI to have died in 1179 and Wulgrin III to have ruled for only two years. His untimely death was the first break in the house of Taillefer, which had ruled Angoul√™me since the days of the Carolingians. As he had only one daughter, Mathilde of Angoul√™me, the territory went to his younger brother, William VII of Angoul√™me. Wulgrin's daughter, Mathilde, would marry Hugh IX of Lusignan, who would eventually inherit the kingdom, over the claims of John of England, through Isabella of Angoul√™me, the daughter of Aymer of Angoul√™me, the third and youngest brother.

The university is named after the prominent scientist George Emil Palade.  History  Medical education in T√¢rgu Mure»ô (also spelled as T√Ærgu Mure»ô) began in 1945 as a branch of the Faculty of Medicine of the Bolyai University of Cluj. After the foundation of this university, the Faculties of Philology, Philosophy, Law, Economics and Natural Sciences started their activity in Cluj, and the Faculty of Medicine was moved to T√¢rgu Mure»ô, where it operated between 1945 and 1948.History of the Faculty of Medicine In 1948, after the Education Reform, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Institute of T√¢rgu Mure»ô was founded, an independent higher education institution with the following faculties: Medicine, Paediatrics, Hygiene, Dentistry and Pharmacy. Between 1951 and 1958 it comprised three faculties: General Medicine, Paediatrics and Pharmacy. In 1958-1959 the Faculty of Paediatrics was transformed into a department; and from 1960-1961 the department of Dentistry started operating again, becoming a faculty in the academic year 1965-1966. By Decree 800/ 1965 and by the Order of the Minister of Education, the Institute of Medicine and Pharmacy of T√¢rgu Mure»ô gained the right to award doctoral degrees in medicine (7 professors were appointed as doctoral supervisors). The Faculty of Pharmacy ceased its activity between 1986 and 1990. In 1991, the Institute was given the name of University of Medicine and Pharmacy of T√¢rgu Mure»ô (UMF T√¢rgu Mure»ô/MOGyE).

An action movie that gives a wild and funny vision of the Wild West. Joe and Averell are respectively the oldest and youngest of the four Dalton brothers, the most dangerous bandits in the history of the Far West, and their failures are of such caliber that their own mother is turning against them. But they react when Mama Dalton kicks them out of their own home and they decide to make her proud of them by stealing the Gulch City Bank where safety is so high that even employees are trained in the combat arts. They fail in the robbery of the bank and Joe and Averell, along with their brothers, are imprisoned. In the cell they meet a Mexican who reveals information about a magic hat that makes him invincible. Joe immediately decides to get the hat, so the four brothers run away from prison and head for Mexico, leaving chaos in their wake. Arguing non-stop, Joe and Averell compete for power in a small town and manage to infiltrate a gang of criminals, where, after a spectacular battle, they steal the magic hat from the bandit who had it. But the problems are only beginning because of the constant and growing rivalry between Joe and Averell and the fact that the law is on their heels. Again in Gulch City, the brothers will try to steal the bank again and get their mother to be proud of them.

One of the SAC's initial missions was to plan strategic aerial reconnaissance on a global scale. The first efforts were in photo reconnaissance and mapping. Along with the photo-recon mission, a small electronic intelligence, or ELINT, cadre was operating. Weather reconnaissance was part of the effort, as was Long Range Detection, the search for Soviet atomic explosions. In the late 1940s, strategic intelligence on Soviet capabilities and intentions was scarce. Before the development of the U-2 high-altitude spy plane and reconnaissance satellites, technology and politics limited American reconnaissance efforts to the borders, and not the heartland, of the Soviet Union. Ladd AFB was one of the important staging areas for gathering what strategic intelligence could be obtained along Soviet borders. However the early reconnaissance crews did more than gather intelligence about Soviet coastal operations. With the advent of the polar concept, military planners realized that they had very little operational knowledge of the Arctic region north of Alaska. Alaskan recon crews had a variety of missions that helped lay the groundwork for polar navigation, flying and maintaining aircraft under Arctic conditions, and understanding weather systems. Their missions contributed to military and civilian knowledge in topography, Arctic search and rescue, and other areas. Ladd was the base for one of the first strategic reconnaissance squadrons of the Cold War was the 46th Reconnaissance Squadron (later redesignated the 72d Reconnaissance Squadron (also known as the 46th/72d). The squadron's mission was to develop accurate polar navigation, survey and map the Arctic, perform comprehensive weather studies, test its men and equipment in Arctic conditions, and later train other units, particularly SAC bombers, in polar navigation and operations and fly long range photographic intelligence flights with RB-29 Superfortresses. During the squadron's tenure at Ladd its men accomplished some of the most challenging tasks of Arctic flying and laid the groundwork for other units which carried on its mission through the 1950s. The 46th/72d was a tenant unit, reporting directly to SAC headquarters. SAC selected Ladd as the home for this unit because of Ladd's northern location. In 1946, prior to the formation of the Yukon Composite Wing, the base was in caretaker status. Demobilization was still the order of the day throughout the services. Ongoing cold weather testing was Ladd's main operation, together with oversight of the scattered outposts of the Yukon Sector. The 46th/72d's reconnaissance missions were intertwined with basic operational concerns, particularly since this was the first such unit to undertake long-range, long-term duties in the western Arctic. In order to perform reconnaissance, for example, the crews had to perfect the grid navigation system for polar flying, a complex method which until that time had not been systematically tested. As a photo reconnaissance unit, the 46th/72d collected intelligence until 1949, when other units took over the work. Its missions included searching for unclaimed Arctic land masses, evaluating the Soviet presence in the Arctic, and photomapping Alaska, the Canadian archipelago, Greenland, and portions of Soviet territory. Using specially modified RB-29s, crews flew long-range missions of 12 to 30 hours' duration, virtually all of it under strict radio silence. The ten-man crews included a captain and a combination of relief pilots, navigators, radar operators, radio operators, and photographers. One aircraft, #871, had a high- tech oblique camera with 100 inch focal length which could photograph installations up to 100 miles away. Some of the most important missions involved reconnaissance of the Soviets' Chukotski Peninsula in 1948 and 1949, which allayed fears of Soviet buildup in that region directed against the United States. The 46th/72d also photographed the Kamchatka Peninsula, Anadyr, Diomede, Wrangel Island, northern Siberia, and Novaya Zemlya, the Soviet Union's nuclear testing area. Aerial reconnaissance also contributed to mapping projects in Alaska and the Arctic carried out by a number of agencies including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Coast & Geodetic Survey. In 1946‚Äì48, the 46th/72d recon squadron, with the assistance of Canadian crews, completed the \\"Polaris\\" project which systematically photomapped the Canadian archipelago. Later, builders of the DEW Line referred back to this information during site selection.' In October 1949, the National Geographic Society released its new map of the Arctic, crediting the aerial photography teams of the U.S. Air Force, and the Ladd squadron in particular, with providing the updated information. In addition to the aerial reconnaissance, Electronic Reconnaissance (ELINT) missions were flown from Eielson, during the summer of 1947. By 1949, the missions had discovered and assessed eleven Soviet radar sites, and had revealed where significant gaps in Soviet Arctic defenses lay. This gave planners the information they needed to develop routes for strategic bombers, and laid the groundwork for the initial war plans covering the Soviet Far East. Electronic reconnaissance continued through the 1950s although little information is available. At neighboring Eielson AFB, ELINT missions took place throughout the 1950s and continued to the 1980s Weather reconnaissance took place throughout Ladd's Cold War years, from the first arrival of the 59th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1946 through the flights of the 55th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1960. Gathering weather information for combat readiness was an integrated part of strategic aerial reconnaissance. Weather recon, though, was a particularly loose term. There was a constant need for weather information, but weather flights were also a convenient cover for the more covert missions. As neighboring Eielson AFB developed into a SAC base, much of the reconnaissance mission shifted to its facilities. Eielson became the primary site for strategic reconnaissance around 1949, when the 375th Reconnaissance Squadron was transferred from Ladd. =Air Defense= 449th FIS F-82Hs 46-384 and 46-504 on the ramp at Ladd AFB, July 1950 449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94A-5-LO 49-2531, Ladd AFB, 1955 The wing's central mission was air defense. Ladd AFB was the northern hub for Alaskan air defense operations and logistics. It was the sector command headquarters for air defense engagement, coordinating ground control and intercept functions and supporting the outlying northern elements of the air defense system. Initially, Ladd's role was to emphasize defense against manned aircraft attack. However, after 1957, ballistic missiles changed the direction of air defense, and Ladd's role would change accordingly. The regional air defense mission involved locating, identifying, and destroying hostile manned aircraft. It consisted of several coordinated functions. Radar sites swept the skies for indications of air intrusions; communications links provided information to the ground controllers and intercept pilots; fighter-intercept aircraft were kept on alert for dispatch to identify and intercept intruders. Ground controllers prepared to track and direct potential air battles, while ground-based artillery units stood by to attack any enemy aircraft that passed through the intercept net and approached the air base itself. AC&W; squadrons from Ladd manned the new outlying radar sites as they came on line in the early 1950s. They were supported by fighter intercept squadrons based at Ladd. In 1951, three AC&W; squadrons were active; by the late 1950s, there were as many as ten AC&W; squadrons assisted by three squadrons of fighter-interceptors at Ladd and Galena, the major forward base Fighter-intercept pilots and ground crews served on alert duty, ready to scramble their aircraft to intercept any unknown airplanes entering Alaskan airspace in the northern zone. An Air Defense Control Center (ADCC) coordinated air defense operations and training exercises for the AC&W;, Fighter-Interceptor, and AAA units. After 1958, the entire air defense operation ran out of the Alaskan NORAD Region Command and Control Center at Elmendorf. As part of the national-level division of roles and missions, Army units were responsible for certain ground-based air defenses. At Ladd, Army AAA units cooperated with the ADCC to provide antiaircraft defense with Skysweeper artillery. After 1959, five outlying Nike sites protected the Ladd/Eielson complex. The Nike Hercules weapons were computer-guided surface- to-air missiles designed to explode amid enemy bomber formations. =Search and Rescue= During World War II, Alaska's military search and rescue teams had developed equipment, operating systems and knowledge to serve the men in action. At the end of the war, the resources all but disappeared. By April 1946, the Alaskan Air Command realized that it would need to re-establish this capability, and it consolidated its efforts into one reorganized unit, the 10th Air Rescue Squadron. With headquarters and a coordination center located at Elmendorf AFB, this unit took responsibility for search, aid and rescue. The 10th maintained the 74th detachment at Ladd, which was upgraded to a squadron in 1952. By the time USAF inactivated the 10th Rescue in 1958, it had saved military and civilian lives throughout the Territory and had become well known as the glamour unit of the 1950s Air Force in Alaska. =Arctic Research= Cold weather testing was Ladd Field's original mission. The first Cold Weather Detachment arrived in September 1940 and set to work testing aircraft, clothing and equipment. By the end of the war, they had evaluated nearly every type of aircraft in the frigid conditions of interior Alaska. Initially, Ladd Field had been the only U.S. facility which could perform these tests under continuous conditions of extreme cold. By 1950, Ladd's Cold Weather Test Group had been assigned to the new Air Force Research and Development Command. The 5001st Research and Development Group at Ladd came into existence a year later \\"to monitor all arctic tests of equipment and material...which are conducted in Alaska..., [and] to furnish test facilities and administrative services....\\"9~ Under this umbrella, the 5064th Cold Weather Materiel Testing Squadron continued the cold weather testing mission together with the Arctic Aeromedical Lab In 1951 the 5064th performed tests on engines, arctic flying clothing, and armament as well as on aircraft maintenance procedures. The 5064th operated aircraft maintenance and shop facilities. From 1946 to 1961, USAF engaged in observations of polar ice pack phenomena which resulted in the support of three major manned ice stations. The Russians had begun drift station research a decade earlier. In 1937, they undertook scientific experiments from a drifting ice station near the North Pole, and they had followed that up after the war with an accelerated program of ice pack investigations. USAF began its inquiries in 1946 with the reconnaissance sorties of Project Nanook, as the 460th photo recon unit from Ladd searched the Arctic for undiscovered lands During the 1950s, AAC and Ladd AFB were involved in supporting a series of ice stations. The first, T-3, was located on a drifting ice island and hosted scientific parties during several lengthy occupations. Joint military-civilian teams first occupied T-3 from 1952 ‚Äì 1954 during Project Icicle. Under Project Ice Skate, the station was used again during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957‚Äì58 and beyond. Over the years, T-3 drifted across the Arctic basin, leaving the zone of AAC support periodically. During the IGY, when T-3 had drifted to Greenland, two other stations were established in the western Arctic as pack ice stations. Ice Station Alpha was occupied from 1957 ‚Äì late 1958. When it began to break up, crews established a new station the following spring. Known as Ice Station Charlie, it lasted ten months before meeting the same fate. In 1961, USAF ended its sponsor¬¨ship of ice station research, turning its remaining facilities on T-3 over to the Navy. In an approach typical of the Cold War, ice station research included both basic and applied science in a framework of partnership between military and contracted researchers. By sponsoring and supporting the stations, USAF contributed to basic geophysical research as it tested military applications for its own purposes. Contributions to basic geophysics included studies in oceanography, arctic meteorology and the upper atmosphere, ice movement, solar radiation, gravity and magnetism, and ice island features and origins. The Air Force also gained experience in developing the islands as forward military stations with weather stations, emergency landing facilities and listening posts. References * Sackett. Russell H.

Geography  It lies about south of Bergen on the B 3 federal road in the glacial valley of the River √ñrtze. It has an area of and a current population of 217 inhabitants. It is administratively responsible for the neighbouring hamlets of Achterberg, Gr√ºnewald and Wallerholz.  Population  = Religion = Until 1971 Hassel belonged to the parish of Winsen. Then, at the request of the parishioners, they were transferred to the parish of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian in S√ºlze. The majority of Hassel's population are Protestant; Roman Catholic villagers come under the parish of Bergen. = Language = Hassel lies within the Low German language region and Northern Low Saxon dialect group. Since the end of the Second World War, High German (i.e. standard German) has become widespread and largely superseded Low German. However, amongst the older villagers Low German is still used colloquially.  History  It is not clear when the village of Hassel first came into being, but what is certain is that the first settlements appeared between Kr√§henberg and Ostermoor on the slopes of the glacial valley of the √ñrtze. Hassel was first mentioned in the records in 1298. In a list of cattle holdings in 1438 three farms are documented; in 1589 five farmsteads are named in a housebook. These three farms and two individual houses (K√∂tnerh√∂fen) continued to exist over the following centuries and it was not until the 19th century that further farms appeared. The 19th century was characterised by extensive agricultural reforms. Fundamental to subsequent reforms was the general division (Generalteilung) of land at the beginning of the 19th century, whereby the villages were given fixed boundaries and every piece of land was allocated to a municipality (Gemeinde). The amount of land around the individual villages which was allocated to them was based on the grazing rights they had held in the past. This was followed during the period 1838 to 1858 by the division of common land (Gemeinheitsteilungen). Common land, i.e. those areas which had hitherto been shared by the community, was now transferred to the individual farms as freehold property based on their existing rights to the common land. On the basis of the Kingdom of Hanover's 1833 redemption law the obligations on farms under the manorial system were repealed. Farms to which the so-called manorial rights applied had been hitherto obliged to give numerous services and make frequent payments to the manor. That was now repealed on payment of 25 times the annual dues and the land was then granted under freehold into the farmers' ownership. One consequence of the redemption law was that the land holdings could now be freely sold.The manorial rights to which the farms had hitherto been tied, only allowed the farms to have very limited control over the ownership of land. That created the right conditions for the establishment of new farmsteads. As a result, in the second half of the 19th century, a new village appeared on the Achterberg.  Politics and administration  Since the 14th century Winsen was recorded as having a vogtei's office, the lowest level of administration and justice, which was presided over by a ducal vogt. Matters of importance that only affected Hassel were discussed and decided by the Realgemeinde, i.e. the farm owners who had common land rights. The political reforms of the 19th century brought about a fundamental change from which the political municipality of S√ºlze arose. Participation in the resolution of village affairs was no longer dependent on ownership of property or land; instead every male villager over 25 had the right to vote. Since the merging of local councils as part of the Lower Saxon administrative reforms of 1971, Hassel has been part of the town of Bergen. Hassel is represented by a local council (Ortsrat) and a mayor (Ortsb√ºrgermeister). The council is empowered, inter alia, to make decisions about public services in the village, is responsible for maintaining the appearance of the village and for overseeing its clubs and societies, and has to be consulted by the town of Bergen on all important matters affecting the village. It consists of five elected representatives who, together with the mayor, sit on the Bergen town council. The village council elects its own mayor. The current incumbent is Helmut Ebel.

Life Christina was the daughter of King Inge the Elder of Sweden and Queen Helena. Helena was the sister of Blot-Sven King of Sweden. She was likely the eldest of the three royal daughters, being married before her sisters Margaret and Catherine. Christina was married to Mstislav, who was Prince of Veliky Novgorod, Rostov, and Belgorod during their marriage, thereby giving her the equivalent titles. According to Vasily Tatishchev they married in 1095. Polish historian Dariusz DƒÖbrowski stated that Tatischev didn't base on reliable source. Christina married Mstislav between 1090 and 1096.

Students participating in the sifting, ca. 2005 The project has made heavy use of crowd-sourcing, utilizing many volunteers and tourists to help sift the debris, and is actually the most exposed to the public archaeological project in the world. The project sifting facility was located until 2017 Tzurim Valley national park, and since June 2019 has moved to the Masu‚Äôot Lookout at Mt. Scopus.  Background and history  Despite its historical importance, no archaeologist has ever been able to carry out a systematic excavation on the Temple Mount. This was the state of affairs, when in November 1999 approximately 9,000 tons of archaeologically-rich soil were removed from the Temple Mount by the Waqf, using heavy earth moving equipment and without a preceding salvage excavation or proper archaeological care, following works in and around the newly constructed underground el-Marwani Mosque.; Yitzkak Reiter and John Seligman \\"1917 to the Present: AL-Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount (Har ha-Bayit) and the Western Wall\\", in: Oleg Grabar & Benjamin Z. Kedar (eds.), Where Heaven and Earth Meet: Jerusalem's Sacred Esplanade, Jerusalem, 2009, pp. 268-270. The debris was moved to several locations, with the lion's share (an estimated 350 truckloads) dumped in the Kidron Valley, near the north-eastern corner of the old city. These soil heaps were inspected and sampled by Israel Antiquities Authority officials, but no full-scale excavation ensued. In 2004, an excavation permit was issued to Israeli archaeologists Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira (Zweig), under the auspices of Bar-Ilan University, who, with funding from private backers through the Israel Exploration Society, proceeded to retrieve most of the heaps of soil and move them to a secure location provided by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority in the Emek Tzurim National Park. In 2005, after experiencing financial difficulties, the project collaborated with the Ir-David foundation, who took responsibility on the administration of the sifting site, while the scientific oversight retained by Barkay and Dvira. Over the years, in addition to its scientific mission, the project took on an educational and touristic character as well, drawing hundreds of thousands of volunteers and tourists who briefly joined the sifting activity, supervised by staff members. in April 2017, the Sifting Project withdrew its partnership with the Ir David Foundation and discontinued active sifting, focusing instead on laboratory research of artifacts already recovered.Approximately 70% of the debris was had been sifted at this time. The Sifting Project has held several Crowdfunding campaigns, and as of December 2018, has enough funds to keep afloat, but not enough to complete all research nor to resume the sifting, which has continued sporadically.; and a public commitment by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to provide government backing for the Project,; has yet to bear fruit. The Ir David Foundation retains the former sifting site of the project in Emek Tzurim and runs there an \\"Archaeological Experience\\", where visitors sift soil from various excavations in Jerusalem. Active sifting of Temple Mount soil resumed in June 2019, in a new site atop Mount Scopus .  Methodology  Unable to apply traditional excavation techniques to the disturbed soil, the project founders opted to sift the entirety of the soil retrieved from the dumping grounds. At the sifting site, the soil was dry- sifted and transferred into buckets, where it was left to soak. The remaining soil was then washed off over a wire mesh, and archaeological artifacts hand- picked from among remaining stones and modern refuse. This process was mostly undertaken by volunteers and tourists, under supervision of experienced staff. Objects retrieved from the wet-sifting process are then sorted and cataloged by on-site archaeologists, and transferred to an archaeological laboratory, to be further studied by specialists who prepare the finds for publication. Much like an archaeological survey, the types of finds are categorized, counted and compared to different types both within the site and in nearby sites.Relics in Rubble, pp. 47-48; New Data in the Sifting Project of Soil from the Temple Mount: Second Preliminary Report, pp. 29-30. Prior to the onset of the TMSP, the wet-sifting technique, in which significant portions of the site's soil (as opposed to selected loci) are water-screened, was used by local archaeologists only in some Prehistoric sites. This led to a problem in comparing finds from the Temple Mount to other sites. For example, while comparison to other Iron Age Judahite sites showed a similar distribution of different types of figurines (human, animal, etc.),Iron Age II Figurine Fragments from the Temple Mount Soil, pg. 139. the percentage of fragments was incomparable - more leg fragments were recovered by the TMSP than all other sites combined, and horn\\\\ear fragments were reported solely by the TMSP.Ibid, pp. 134, 138. This is not to say that such fragment did not exist in other sites, but rather, that their small size caused them to remain unnoticed by archaeologists excavating in traditional methods. To overcome this sampling bias, samples were taken from various excavation sites in Jerusalem and subjected to wet-sifting in order to act as a control group.The Temple Mount Sifting Project: Preliminary Report 3, pg. 52; Secondary Refuse Aggregates from the First and Second Temple Periods on the Eastern Slope of the Temple Mount, pp. 63-106. In the ensuing years, multiple excavation projects in Jerusalem and its environs have adopted the wet-sifting technique,e.g.: Reich, R., Shukron, E., and Lernau, O. \\"Recent discoveries in the City of David, Jerusalem\\", 'Israel Exploration Journal 57:2 (2007), pg. 154; Guy Bar-Oz et. al., ‚ÄúHoly Garbage‚Äù: a quantitative study of the city-dump of Early Roman Jerusalem, Levant, 39:1 (2007), pg. 4. some of them outsourcing the sifting work to the TMSP.e.g. Eilat Mazar, Ophel excavations to the south of the Temple Mount, 2009-2013 : final reports : volume I, pg. xvii; Eilat Maza et al. \\"A Cuneiform Tablet from the Ophel in Jerusalem\\", Israel Exploration Journal 60(1), Jerusalem, 2010, pg. 4. The rising popularity of the wet- sifting technique has correlated to a notable rise in the number of seal and seal impressions discovered in excavations carried out in Jerusalem.Relics in Rubble, pg. 48. In January 2013, the project announced the development of a statistical method using cluster analysis to partially reconstruct the original context of some of the finds. Later that year, it was announced that enough artifacts had been collected to serve as a representative sample, and common finds collected from that point forward will not be included in the final publication.  Finds  Most of the artifacts discovered are quite small, no larger than a few centimeters. Their origins span several millennia ‚Äì from the Stone Age up to the 20th century. = The Stone and Bronze Ages = Only a tiny fraction of the finds date to these periods, the earliest among them dated to the Epipalaeolithic or the Neolithic Period.3rd report, pg. 67. The Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages are mostly represented by sherds of local pottery, but some examples of Mycenaean pottery have been found as well. Other finds from these periods include 3 Bronze Age scarabs2nd report, pp. 36‚Äì37; 3rd report, pp. 67‚Äì68. and an amulet bearing the name of Thutmose III. A broken finger of a statue probably dates to the Late Bronze Age. = The Iron Age (First Temple Period, 1000‚Äì586 BC) = Examples of common finds, early periods. Approximately 15% of the pottery finds in the TMSP date to the Iron Age, mostly to the Iron Age IIb-III (800‚Äì586 BC).Relics in Rubble, pg. 50. Among the finds from the Iron Age IIa (10th‚Äì9th century BCE) are a rare impression seal and an arrowhead. The later Iron Age is well represented in the finds: About 130 typical Judahite figurine fragments have been recovered from the Temple Mount soil, and another 30 from an ancient garbage dump in the Eastern Slopes of the Temple Mount.Iron Age II Figurine Fragments from the Temple Mount Soil, pg. 42. Other finds include Judean stone weights, weaponry‚Äîincluding a rare arrowhead of the Scytho-Iranian type‚Äîintroduced to Jerusalem by the forces of Nebuchadnezzar II, and inscription bearing artifacts, including a LMLK seal, dozens of ostraca and several seals and sealing (bullae), the most prominent among them being the Immer Bulla, a broken sealing, paleographically dated to the 7th‚Äì6th century BC and bearing the incomplete given name [...]lyahu and the patronym Immer, the name of a well known Biblical priestly family, whose one member is recorded as a major office holder in the Temple. The sealing, which bears on its back fiber impressions, was affixed to a cloth sack, pouch, or lid, possibly relating to the Temple treasury.Relics in Rubble, pp. 50‚Äì52. = The Second Temple Period (516 BCE ‚Äì 70 CE) = Herodian and other Opus Sectile tile patterns presented by Gabriel Barkay (leaning) to Moshe Ya'alon (left) Within the Temple Mount's history, no other period saw as much activity as the Second Temple Period ‚Äì both in terms of construction projects carried out, chiefly that of Herod's Temple, and in volume of people going about their day-to-day activity. This is well attested in the pottery finds of the TMSP, over 40% of which date to this period (‚Öî of that dating between Herod's reign (37 BCE) and the destruction of the Temple (70 CE)). A number of architectural remains are ascribed to this period, the largest among them being a 75 cm wide Doric capital, which may have topped an 18 foot tall column within Solomon's Porch. Another noted architectural discovery consisted of dozens of multi-colored Opus sectile tiles of various shapes, which enabled a reconstruction of the tiling patterns employed in the courtyards of Herod's Temple.Barkay, G., Dvira, Z. 2016. and Snyder, F., What the Temple Mount Floor Looked Like. Biblical Archaeology Review 42:06. Nov/Dec 2016. pp. 56‚Äì59. For media coverage see, e.g., ; ; more than 500 of the coins discovered in the sifting date to this period, spanning from the 6th century BCE Yehud coinage till the First Jewish Revolt coinage of the year 70 CE. Other finds of the period include hundreds of fragments of stone vessels typical to late 2nd Temple Judea, over a thousand fresco fragments, weaponry and epigraphic finds.Relics from Rubble, pp. 52‚Äì54. = The Byzantine Period (324‚Äì638) = Examples of common finds, Classical- Medieval Periods. A full third of all the coins found date to this period, along with large amounts of pottery. A relatively surprising phenomena was the discovery of a large number of luxurious architectural artifacts from the period ‚Äì including Opus sectile tiles, roof tiles, Corinthian capitals, chancel screens and a multitude of mosaic tesserae ‚Äì which led researchers to question the historical sources that depict the Temple Mount as abandoned at the time. Additional finds include cruciform pendants, clay oil lamps emblazoned with crosses and bronze weights. = The Early Islamic Period (638‚Äì1099) = Approximately one in four pottery fragments recovered by the TMSP date to this period, mostly consisting of Umayyad tableware and storage vessels, and Abbasid tableware, storage and cooking vessels. Other finds include many architectural elements connected to the construction of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the most prominent being thousands of colored and gilded mosaic tesserae belonging to wall mosaics, most likely the mosaics akin to those adorning the inner walls of the dome of the rock, which adorned the outer walls till their replacement by glazed tiles in the 16th century.3rd Report, pp. 63, 78‚Äì79. = The Crusader Period (1099‚Äì1187) = During this period, the use of the sub-floor structure of the Temple Mount as a stables by the Knights Templar gave Solomon's Stables its current name. This is reflected in finds such as hundreds of armor scales, horseshoe nails, and arrowheads. Over a hundred silver Crusader coins make up the biggest and most varied collection of such coins from Jerusalem.Relics in Rubble, pg. 55 Opus Sectile tiles from this era match up exactly to patterns seen under the Dome of the Rock's carpeting, as well as the churches of the Holy Sepulchre and of St. John the Baptist. = The Mamluk and Ottoman periods (1260‚Äì1917) = Examples of common finds, later periods. The Mamluk period is represented mainly by pottery, coins, gaming pieces, jewelry and some architectural elements. A large variety of finds date to the Ottoman Period, including finds related to renovation projects undergone during this era, such as glazed tiles which have coated the outer walls of the Dome of the Rock since the 16th century, and fragments of colorful stained glass windows. Over a dozen personal seals dating to this period were found, including one bearing the name of Sheikh Abd al-Fattah al-Tamimi,Relics in Rubble, pg. 55; who would go on to serve as deputy to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and Qadi in Ramla, Gaza and Nablus in the early 18th century. Hundreds of clay pipes, and various types of weaponry, including gunflints, and lead and iron bullets and shells. A large amount of glass bracelet and anklets span both the Mamluk and Ottoman Periods. = World War I and onward (1917‚Äì1999) = Many modern artifacts were found, including mainly pottery such as porcelain and Marseilles tiles, modern coinage, prayer rugs and clothing accessories including military insignia and weaponry of various military forces.

He was the team captain and lead the Wolves to their first OHL final in 30 years. He was drafted 12th overall by the New York Rangers in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft but did not start playing in the NHL until 2007. Like Eric, Marc was a part of the YoungStars game at the All-Star Game in his rookie season. In 2010, after signing a 5-year extension with the Rangers, as well as a strong training camp, Marc was named an alternate captain of the team. Marc played on his brother Eric's team at the 2011 NHL All Star Game. On February 22, 2011, Marc was checked by his brother Eric and was slow to get up. He played the remainder of the season but it was revealed before the Rangers 2011 training camp that Marc was suffering from post-concussion symptoms. He did not return until January 2, 2012, to play in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic against the Philadelphia Flyers. Marc again lost most of a season due to injury in the lockout shortened 2012‚Äì13 season, as in March he got hit by a puck in the eye playing against the Flyers. Marc returned as a regular with the Rangers in 2013‚Äì14, and helped the team get to the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals against the Los Angeles Kings, losing in 5 games. On September 26, 2020, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings. Jordan Staal with the Hurricanes in 2013 Jordan Staal (born September 10, 1988) is the third-oldest of the brothers. He played major junior for the same club as his brother Eric, the Peterborough Petes. With an almost point per game pace, Jordan helped lead the Petes to the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions in 2006. He was drafted second overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut in October 2006, a year before his older brother Marc. Jordan played in the YoungStars game at the 2007 NHL All-Star Game. He was nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the Rookie of the Year by the NHL, but was beat out by teammate Evgeni Malkin. In 2008, the Penguins made the Stanley Cup final but were defeated in six games by the Detroit Red Wings. He served as an alternate captain of the Penguins in December 2008, later he was named a full-time alternate captain at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season. On June 12, 2009, Jordan became the second of the Staal brothers to hoist the Stanley Cup after defeating the reigning champion Red Wings in seven games. Due to a series of injuries, Jordan did not make his 2010‚Äì11 season debut until January 1, 2011 at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. At the NHL entry draft in 2012, Jordan was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes, to be re-united with older brother Eric Staal. He then signed a 10-year, $60 million contract with Carolina. Jordan is now the captain for the Carolina Hurricanes as of 2019-20. Jared Jared Staal (born August 21, 1990) is the youngest and the only brother to shoot right-handed. He played major junior for the Sudbury Wolves and played with his brother Marc during the 2006-07 season. Jared was taken 49th overall by the Phoenix Coyotes in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, the only brother to be drafted by a Western Conference team. In 2009, Jared signed an amateur tryout contract with the Coyotes' AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. He appeared for five games with the Rampage before being sent back to the Sudbury Wolves. On May 13, 2010, the Carolina Hurricanes, the team his brothers Eric and Jordan played for, acquired his rights from the Coyotes for a 5th round draft pick. The next day, the Hurricanes signed Jared to a three-year entry-level contract. Jared began the 2010‚Äì11 season with the Hurricanes' AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. However, after 12 games, he was sent to the ECHL to play for the Florida Everblades but was later recalled. He returned to the Checkers for the 2011‚Äì12 season but was loaned to the Providence Bruins, the AHL affiliate of the Boston Bruins. On April 24, 2013, the Hurricanes recalled Jared for his only two NHL games. He played the 2017‚Äì18 season in the EIHL for the Edinburgh Capitals.

Her father was a Protestant who left the family, leaving her mother to support them. Carney was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Donegall Street in the city, later teaching at the school. She enrolled at Hughes Commercial Academy around 1910, where she qualified as a secretary and shorthand typist, one of the first women in Belfast to do so. However, from the start she was looking towards doing more than just secretarial work. Early career In 1912 Carney was in charge of the women's section of the Irish Textile Workers' Union in Belfast, which she founded with Delia Larkin in 1912. During this period she met James Connolly and became his personal secretary.Irish Political Prisoners, 1848‚Äì1922: Theatres of War By Se√°n McConville Carney became Connolly's friend and confidant as they worked together to improve the conditions for female labourers in Belfast. Carney and Connolly worked together to try a better women's rights and suffrage among the female factory labourers, alongside fellow union oragnisers such as Ellen Grimley. According to her biographer Helga Woggon, Carney was the person best acquainted with Connolly's politics. Carney then joined Cumann na mBan, the women's auxiliary of the Irish Volunteers, and attended its first meeting in 1914.Irish women and the First World War, part 3 ‚Äì Women and the 1916 Rising, by Lynda Walker Easter Rising She was present with Connolly in the Dublin General Post Office during the Easter Rising in 1916.

They made their new headquarters in nearby Moore Street before Pearse surrendered. leftthumb265x265pxThe Dublin General Post Office, wherein Carney was with Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising. After her capture, she was held in Kilmainham Gaol and was then moved to Mountjoy Prison. Carney, alongside Helena Molony, Maria Perolz, Brigid Foley and Ellen O'Ryan and others were moved to an English prison. 69 women were released from prison one week after the execution of the Rising's leaders. By August 1916 Carney was imprisoned in Aylesbury prison alongside Nell Ryan and Helena Molony. The three requested that their internee status, and the privileges it brought, be revoked so that they would be held as normal prisoners with Countess Markievicz. Their request was denied, however Carney and Molony were released two days before Christmas 1916.Internment by John McGuffin After the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the formation of the Irish Free State, Carney sided with the Anti-Treaty forces and was arrested several times. Despite her own time of imprisonment, Carney was not opposed to visiting her political friends during their times in prison. It was recorded that she visited Austin Stack in December 1918.  Political career  She was one of the first Irish women to be qualified as a secretary and a short hand typist from Hughes' Commercial Academy. She worked as a clerk and became involved in the Gaelic League in the Suffragist movement and in socialist activities. She met James Connolly in 1912 and consequently became the secretary for the Textile Workers' Union. In 1913 she was heavily involved in the fundraising for the locked-out Dublin labourers. As a result of her deep involvement with the trade union, she met and eventually became Connolly's typist, typing his articles for publication. Aside from being his typist, she became a friend and confidant. According to her biographer, Helga Woggon, she had become the person most closely acquainted with Connolly's beliefs, ideals, and plans. When the Great War commenced in 1914, Carney concurred with Connolly that it was the perfect time to stage a rebellion, even if it was only of a symbolic value. While she was in Cumann na mBan, she taught first aid and developed a proficiency for handling a rifle. On 14 April 1916, she was summoned by Connolly to join him in the insurgents in the General Post Office where they were garrisoned. Initially, Carney was the only woman at the headquarters of the General Post Office and one of the three remaining women when the garrison had to evacuate the building when it was burned and had to relocate to Moore Street. After Connolly became wounded, she stayed with him. Afterwards, Carney was arrested and held in Kilmainham, Mountjoy, and Aylesbury Jails until the Christmas of 1916. In the 1917 Belfast Cumann na mBan convention, she was the delegate. She stood for Parliament as a Sinn F√©in candidate for Belfast Victoria in the 1918 general election. She polled 4.05% of the vote, gaining 539 votes. Carney lost to the Labour Unionists. Having lost, she decided instead to continue her work at the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union until 1928. By 1924 she had become a member of the Labour Party. In the 1930s she joined the Belfast Socialist Party. Following the Civil War, Carney became a lot more disillusioned with politics. She was very critical and outspoken of √âamon de Valera and his governments. Later life and death alt=Courtesy: 1916IrishCollectorthumbWinifred Carney's 1916 and War of Independence Medals Courtesy: Dullaghan Private Collection (www.facebook.com/groups/EarlyIrishMilitaria) In 1928 she married George McBride, a Protestant Orangeman and former member of the Ulster Volunteers.See Allison Murphy, Winnie & George: An Unlikely Union (Cork: Mercier Press, 2017) for an account of the marriage and other aspects of Carney's life. Ironically, the formation of the Ulster Volunteers prompted the formation of the Irish Volunteers, of which Carney was a member. Carney alienated anyone in her life that did not support her marriage to George McBride. McBride was however a fellow socialist. She continued to be involved in the trade union movement, working for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.Culture Northern Ireland A number of serious health problems limited her political activities in the late 1930s.Seven Women of the Labour Movement 1916, by Sin√©ad McCoole Carney died in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 21 November 1943, and is buried in Milltown Cemetery. Her resting place was found years later and a headstone was erected by the National Graves Association, Belfast. Because Carney married a Protestant and former Orangeman, she was not allowed to have his name (McBride) on her gravestone due to the religious differences. They were married for fifteen years and George McBride never remarried after Carney's early death. In 2013, the Seventieth Anniversary of Carney's death was remembered by the Socialist Republican Party. Almost one hundred people attended as a short parade followed, marking an commemorating the work Carney did for the cause. She was placed in high esteem among the other hundreds of radical women, who stood up for what they believed in, regardless of the consequences they faced.

In 1925, the Yellow Jackets hockey club, evolved into the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Hockey League. On March 16, 1920 at the Duquesne Gardens, he helped found USA Hockey, the governing body for amateur ice hockey in the United States. That same year, he assembled the first U.S. Olympic Hockey Team which won a silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium and is credited with helping to foster the growth of hockey in the country. Outside of sports, also Schooley worked as the treasurer to the City of Pittsburgh and as the campaign manager to Edward V. Babcock, who would go on to become Pittsburgh's mayor in 1918. However a purchasing scandal forced him from his position in 1931, which soon developed to a jury indictment of Schooley on embezzlement and misdemeanor charges. Schooley was unable to attend his trial due to his failing health. The trial was postponed indefinitely and charges were still pending at the time of his death in November 1933. Biography =Hockey referee= Despite his positive impact in promoting ice hockey in the United States, Schooley was actually born in Canada. On April 13, 1880, he was born in Welland, Ontario. He studied law at the University of Toronto, however his fascination with sports diverted him away from that career path. Schooley then came to Pittsburgh in 1901 and worked as a hockey referee. Since the sport was new to most Pennsylvanians, he was viewed as an expert on the sport. Schooley officiated several of the teams associated with the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), the first hockey league to openly hire and trade players. During the 1903-04 season officiated inner-state six games between the Portage Lakes Hockey Club and several teams from the WPHL. He also served as a referee at the Duquesne Gardens from 1906-1908. However the Pittsburgh Press reported on January 5, 1908, that he resigned from his officiating duties, because he could not arrange to with his employers to get away two nights of the week at referee games. On January 14, 1908, the Pittsburgh Press made mention of Schooley returning to work as the referee of a game between the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Lyceum. Schooley became a nationalized citizen of the United States on September 27, 1912. =Hockey manager= USAHA and the Yellow Jackets After his career in politics, Schooley founded the Pittsburgh's amateur hockey team, the Yellow Jackets in 1915, and became the manager of the Duquesne Gardens. As with all American teams of this era, the Yellow Jackets fell under the jurisdiction of the International Skating Union. In late October, 1920, the United States Amateur Hockey Association was formed, with Yellow Jackets officials Schooley and W.S. Haddock serving as co-founders and respectively acting as the league's secretary-treasurer and president. However outside of his league and manager duties, Schooley also served as his team's coach at times. On December 5, 1922, he briefly took over coaching duties for the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets at the request of the team's coach, Rennison Manners, to prepare the team against the Toronto Argonauts. According to former sports reporter Paul Sullivan, who covered hockey for much of his life for the Pittsburgh Gazette- Times, the USAHA wasn't a completely amateur league. Sullivan noted that even though the USAHA was called an amateur league, \\"They didn't come down from Canada because they thought Pittsburgh was a nice place.\\" This leads one to believe that money was paid out to top players in the league. The eastern teams of USAHA soon imported Canadian players,to add to their rosters of local players. In 1923, Schooley had invited Lionel Conacher, a future Hall of Famer, to come and ref in Pittsburgh in February 1923, \\"to see if the crowd would take to him\\". Schooley then asked Conacher to play with the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets in a four-game series against his former teammates, and the Toronto Aura Lee hockey team, and against the Hamilton Tigers. Conacher impressed the Pittsburgh fans by scoring 11 of the Yellow Jackets' 23 goals in the four games. Conachar then under the guidance of Roy Schooley, transformed the Yellow Jackets line-up to an almost Canadian team. Schooley then used his connections in the Pittsburgh media to promote Conachar to the city's hockey fans. After seeing how well the fans took to Conacher, Schooley made him the team's captain, and asked him to invite a number of his friends to play for the Yellow Jackets. These players included Harold Cotton, Hib Milks, Harold Darragh, Rodger Smith, Duke McCurry \\"Tex\\" White and goalie Roy Worters. During his time in hockey, Schooley often traveled with his teams often enjoying a wide acquaintance among hockey fans in every city that had a team. Schooley's Yellow Jackets won the USAHA title in 1924 and 1925. Schooley's skills as the team's manager brought the franchise USAHA championships in 1924 and 1925. The Yellow Jackets stopped playing when the United States Amateur Hockey Association folded at the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season. When Schooley encountered financial problems he sold the team to James Callahan, a lawyer from Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. Callahan renamed the team the Pittsburgh Pirates, after the city's major league baseball team, and the team joined the National Hockey League in 1925. However the Pirates left Pittsburgh and became the short-lived Philadelphia Quakers in 1930, due to issues related to the Great Depression and the failure to find a replacement for the aging Duquesne Gardens. Shortly afterwards a second version of the Yellow Jackets returned to Pittsburgh after Schooley re-acquired the team. This team competed in the International Hockey League from 1930 to 1932 and were dormant for a year before competing in the X-Games in 1934‚Äì35. John H. Harris then purchased the team in 1932. 1920 U.S Hockey team In 1920, Schooley became the manager of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. As manager of the Olympic squad, he had full power to select the players for the team. Schooley knew the Pittsburgh players well enough and also evaluated other players from both Boston and St. Paul, when they were at the Duquesne Gardens for games in early to mid-March. On March 16, 1920 he named his team. Forwards: Joe McCormick, Larry McCormick and Herb Drury of Pittsburgh; Frank \\" Moose\\" Goheen and Anthony Conroy of St. Paul; and George Geran and Frank Synott of Boston. Defensemen: Irving Small and Leon Tuck of Boston; and Ed Fitzgerald of St. Paul. Goaltenders: Raymond Bonney of PittsburghGodin pg. 2 and Cyril Weidenborner of St. Paul. Schooley later named Joe McCormick from Pittsburgh as the team's captain.Godin pg. 3 However $15,000 was still need to fund the team's trip to Antwerp, so Schooley used the Duquesne Gardens as the source of the funds. His intent was to play two series of two games each against \\"worthy\\" opponents at the Gardens. The first series on March 22‚Äì23 would be against the Winnipegs, while an opponent remained to be named for March 29‚Äì30 games. All money beyond the guarantee paid to the visitors and \\"bare overhead expenses\\" would go to the Olympic team. Even though Schooley formed the team and managed them up until they left for the Games, he did represent them during the Olympics. Three days before the team was to depart for Antwerp to begin Olympic play, the New York Post reported that Schooley had resigned as manager amid rumors of unspecified friction, which he denied. He cited a family illness as the reason. Schooley was then succeeded by Corneilus Fellows. Whatever the reason for Schooley's departure, the Post commented with considerable justification that \\"the absence of the man who organized and coached the Olympiad team since its formation will be a distinct loss to the American team‚Ä¶\\"Godin pg. 4 The team that Schooley built, won a silver medal at the Antwerp Games.Godin pg. 10 =Media and politics= It was during this time that he also became a reporter for the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph and the Gazette Times. After working on a few general assignments, Schooley was promoted to covering city politics. He soon became a member of the Republican Party and gained the backing of those politically active in the city and county. Political officials were impressed with his executive ability and his faculty of grasping political situations, leading Schooley to become the leading figure in several campaigns. He soon was put in charge of Joseph G. Armstrong's 1913 mayoral bid. Once Armstrong was elected mayor in 1914, Schooley was given the title \\"Secretary to the Mayor\\". However, after a series of newspaper attacks against the Armstrong Administration, Schooley was transferred to the position of city clerk in charge of the Pittsburgh public works division. In 1917 Schooley became the campaign manager for Edward V. Babcock, who would go on to become Pittsburgh's mayor in 1918. After Babcock's victory, Schooley was made the city treasurer. He later became the superintendent for the city's bureau of recreation. In 1926, he helped elect John S. Fisher, Governor of Pennsylvania as well as assist Charles H. Kline in getting re-elected mayor of Pittsburgh. Schooley was then reappointed as the city's treasurer. However, he was forced from the Treasurer's Office in 1931, the result of a purchasing scandal. The failure of the Franklin Savings and Trust Company, brought forth an audit of the Treasurer's Office, since that office was in charge of distributing funds linked to the company. The audit revealed that the city's money was not protected by bonds, as required by law. Other irregularities soon developed which led to a jury indictment of Schooley on embezzlement and misdemeanor charges. Schooley was then removed from office by Charles Kline, who himself was under fire for the scandal. At the same time, Schooley became ill and was unable to even leave his home to attend his own trial. The hearing was postponed indefinitely and charges were still pending at the time of his death. He died at his home in Pittsburgh on November 13, 1933, surrounded by his friends and family.

He was the composer and performer of nearly 150 songs, achieving cult status in Hungarian pop music. Career P√©ter M√°t√© was born on 4 February 1947 in Budapest. He learned singing, playing piano and guitar from age 6 with a private teacher, and from 14, in a school of music. Discovering his talent and wide-spectrum voice, he was taught by known figures like composer Gy√∂rgy Geszler and Andr√°s B√°gya. He gained a wide spectrum of musical knowledge, which allowed him to write, compose, score and play his own music all by himself. These skills proved to be important in gaining his later fame. After some years in a runner-up band from 1965, he made his first recordings at the Magyar R√°di√≥ in 1965, including √ögy v√°rom hogy j√∂ssz-e m√°r?, and Mondd m√°r, in cooperation with Ill√©s. The two songs, and his first prize at the largest pol-beat festival of the Eastern Bloc in Sochi made him well known in the region. Several awards on festivals followed, notably in Cuba, Canada, Germany and Ireland. Besides pop music, he also scored musicals (including Hungarian version of Jesus Christ Superstar), and wrote theatrical background music. The ongoing popularity came with a change of lifestyle, including heavy smoking and alcohol, habits his weak heart could not bear. He died of cardiac seizure on 9 September 1984, aged 37. He was buried in the Farkasr√©ti Cemetery in Budapest, an event that was attended by tens of thousands of mourning fans.

'Bill' Hyland (July 30, 1923 ‚Äì March 2, 2013) was an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician who served as Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly and Attorney General of New Jersey. Later in life he was a partner in the law firm of Riker Danzig and the executor of the estate of Benny Goodman. Biography Hyland was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1923. He graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1944. From a young age he was an accomplished clarinetist, and he worked his way through college by playing with dance bands. During World War II, he served as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Navy. He took part in convoy duty in the Battle of the Atlantic, as well as in the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Luzon. Hyland graduated from University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1949 and was admitted to the New Jersey Bar in the same year. He became involved in Democratic politics in Camden County, and was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1954. He served as Speaker of the Assembly in 1958. Hyland resigned from the Assembly in 1961 when he was nominated by Governor Robert B. Meyner to be the president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Hyland was one of Meyner's choices to succeed him as the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1961, but he lost the nomination to Richard J. Hughes. He continued serving on the Public Utilities Board until 1968, when he resigned to return to his law practice in Camden. He returned to public service when Governor Hughes nominated him to be the chairman of the newly created New Jersey State Commission of Investigation. The Commission succeeded in jailing reputed leaders of organized crime on contempt of court charges for refusing to divulge knowledge of criminal activities. In 1970 Hyland resigned and again returned to his private law practice. In December 1973, Governor-elect Brendan Byrne nominated Hyland as Attorney General of New Jersey. He served from 1974 to 1978, and then joined the law firm Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Debvois and Hyland (later known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti). He retired from the firm in 2006. Hyland continued performing as a clarinetist even while serving as Attorney General. In 1976, he had the opportunity to play with Benny Goodman, and the two struck up a friendship. Goodman named him the legal and musical consultant for his estate, responsible for deciding which previously unreleased recordings were appropriate for release. Upon Goodman's death in 1986, Hyland served as executor of his estate. He died on March 3, 2013. References External links * William F.

Warren was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent following the 2010 NFL Draft and has also played with the Detroit Lions, Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bears. He attended the University of Michigan through his junior year. During his three years playing for the Michigan Wolverines football team, he started in 34 of 36 games. As a member of the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team, whom he led in interceptions, he earned 2009 first team All-Big Ten recognition from the media and second team recognition from the coaches. He had chosen Michigan over his hometown favorite University of Southern California because he believed that he would be able to play immediately there. Warren had played high school football at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in California. Early years A native of Long Beach, California, Warren attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he tallied 114 tackles, 15 pass breakups, five interceptions and three fumble recoveries during his prep career. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Warren ranked third among cornerback prospects and twenty-fifth overall in the nation. Scout.com ranked him fourth among cornerbacks, and ESPN ranked him eighth. He was named to the USA Today All-USA second team and the EA Sports All-American second-team at cornerback. Warren participated in the 2007 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Warren ran a 10.6 seconds time in the 100 meters in high school. At the beginning of the recruiting process, Warren was considered very likely to play for the USC Trojans football team, since they had four players from his high school on the roster and his godfather, Mark Carrier, was a USC alumn. However, USC had a lot of depth at cornerback at the time and Warren (as well as his father) had a good relationship with Michigan assistant coach Ron English. When Warren made Michigan his final decision, he was noted as feeling that his heart wanted him to choose USC, which was the school he had grown up rooting for, but his head led him to Michigan where he could play immediately and work under the tutelage of English, who had developed many defensive backs who went on to the National Football League. College career As a true freshman at Michigan, Warren played in all 13 season games while starting 11 of them at cornerback. He recorded 52 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, one sack, one forced fumble, two fumble recoveries, one interception and six pass breakups. In the September 15, 2007 Michigan-Notre Dame rivalry game, which Michigan won 38‚Äì0, he forced and recovered a Jimmy Clausen fumble on the Notre Dame 21-yard line while the score was 3‚Äì0. The fumble led to a Mike Hart touchdown five plays later. He was named Big Ten Defensive Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News and also made TSN‚Ä≤s and College Football News‚Ä≤ Freshman All-American second team. As a sophomore, he started ten games at cornerback and one at safety. During the November 1, 2008 game at Purdue, he recovered a fumble on Purdue's opening possession that led to a Brandon Minor 45‚Äìyard touchdown run on the next play. As a junior, he started all 12 games at cornerback. That season, he led the Wolverines with four interceptions, which ranked tied for sixth in the Big Ten Conference and 49th in the nation. He recorded one in each of Michigan's first three conference games during the 2009 Big Ten Conference football season, including a controversial one to seal the team's fourth consecutive victory to start the season in their conference opener against the Indiana Hoosiers that withstood instant replay video review. He ran back the third of these interceptions for a 40-yard touchdown in the first minute of the third conference game against the Iowa Hawkeyes. At the conclusion of the season, he was selected as to the 2009 All-Big Ten conference team by the media (first-team) and coaches (second-team). Professional career =Pre-draft= On December 20, 2009, Warren announced his decision to forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. Warren stated that the NFL's Draft Advisory Board advised him that if he entered the draft, he would be selected in the first three rounds. When Warren signed Drew Rosenhaus as his sports agent, he was projected as a first or second round draft choice. Warren was considered to be a man-to-man defense specialist who needed to develop his zone defense skills. Some sources, such as Todd McShay, who felt he was just a cut below the top five cornerbacks in the draft prior to the 2010 NFL Combine, had predicted that Warren could be selected in the second round. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. predicted Warren would be drafted in the third or fourth round of the draft, describing him as ‚Äúa physical corner\\" who \\"likes going head to head on an island with the best receivers in the country, he‚Äôs never had an issue with that. Anticipation is good. Gambler, though. Gave up some big plays.‚Äù Warren aggravated an ankle injury shortly before the NFL Combine, where he struggled in position drills and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds. His disappointing performance was cited as damaging his draft stock. =New York Jets= Despite earlier predictions, Warren was not selected in the draft. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the New York Jets immediately after the draft. Warren's godfather, former Pro Bowl defensive back Mark Carrier, is an assistant coach with the Jets. The 2010 New York Jets have several cornerbacks on their roster, including Darrelle Revis, Antonio Cromartie, Dwight Lowery, Drew Coleman, Marquice Cole and first-round pick Kyle Wilson. Some sources speculate that Warren would be converted to safety. Jets head coach Rex Ryan said that although Warren would be practicing at both cornerback and safety, he felt that Warren's best shot was at safety. Warren, who was sidelined during most of the Jets training camp sessions with a concussion, was waived by New York on September 3, 2010. Warren would be signed to the team's practice squad on September 6, 2010. Warren would later be released from the team's practice squad on September 7, 2010. =2011= Warren signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 7, 2011. He was cut September 4, 2011. Warren then signed with the Detroit Lions a few days later and was placed on the practice squad. Warren was released from the Lions practice squad on September 20, 2011. =2012= On January 6, 2012, he signed a reserve/future contract with the Chicago Bears. On June 12, 2012, he was waived by the Bears. Personal life Warren's uncle Chuckie Miller played for the Indianapolis Colts and his father, Alvin, played football at New Mexico State. His godfather, Carrier, is an assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals.

Functions #Registration of civil aircraft #Certification of airports #Licensing of pilots, aircraft maintenance engineers, air traffic controllers and flight engineers, and conducting examinations and checks for that purpose #Carrying out amendments to the Aircraft Act, the Aircraft Rules and the Civil Aviation Requirements for complying with the amendments to ICAO Annexes, and initiating proposals for amendment to any other Act or for passing a new Act in order to give effect to an international Convention or amendment to an existing convention. #Formulation of standards of airworthiness for civil aircraft registered in India and grant of certificates of airworthiness to such aircraft #Conducting investigation into incidents and serious incidents involving aircraft up to 2250 kg AUW and taking accident prevention measures, including formulation of implementation of Safety Aviation Management Programmes #Checks on the proficiency of flight crew and other operational personnel such as flight dispatchers and cabin crew #Coordination of ICAO matters with all agencies, sending replies to State letters, and taking all necessary action arising out of the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) of ICAO. #Granting Air Operator's Certificates to Indian carriers and regulation of air transport services operating to/from/within/over India by Indian and foreign operators, including clearance of scheduled and non-scheduled flights of such operators #Approval of institutes engaged in flying training including simulator training, AME training, air traffic services training or any other training related with aviation, with a view to ensuring a high quality of training #Approval to aircraft maintenance, repair, design and manufacturing organizations and their continued oversight #A nodal agency for implementing Annex 9 provisions in India and for coordinating matters relating to facilitation at Indian airports, including holding meetings of the National Facilitation Committee DGCA Organisation Manual #Rendering advice to the Government on matters relating to air transport including bilateral air services agreements, on ICAO matters and generally on all technical matters relating to civil aviation, and to act as an overall regulatory and developmental body for civil aviation in the country #Keeping a check on aircraft noise and engine emissions in accordance with ICAO Annex 16 and collaborating with the environmental authorities in this matter, if required #Regulation and oversight of matters related to Air Navigation Services. Coordination at national level for flexi-use of air space by civil and military air traffic agencies and interaction with ICAO for provision of more air routes for civil use through Indian airspace #Promoting indigenous design and manufacture of aircraft and aircraft components by acting as a catalytic agent #Approving training programmes of operators for carriage of dangerous goods, issuing authorizations for carriage of dangerous goods, etc. #Safety Oversight of all entities approved/ certified/ licensed under the Aircraft Rules 1937.  Departments  These are classified and divided into the following: # Administration Directorate # Aerodrome Standards Directorate (AD) # Air Safety Directorate (DAS) # Air Transport Directorate (AT) # Airworthiness Directorate (DAW) (which is also responsible for registering drones in India) # Flight Standards Directorate (FSD) # Information & Regulation Directorate (DRI) # Aircraft Engineering Directorate (AED) # Directorate Of Flying Training (DFT) # Medical Section # Directorate of Training & Licensing (DTL) # Directorate of Airspace and Air Navigation Services Standards (ANSS)  Regional offices  DGCA has fourteen Regional Airworthiness Offices (RAO) at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kochi, Bhopal, Lucknow, Patna, Bhubaneshwar, Kanpur, Guwahati and Patiala. It has also five Regional Air Safety offices located at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. It has a Regional Research and Development Office located at Bangalore and a Gliding Centre at Pune.  Civil Aviation Authority  The CAA has been envisaged as an autonomous regulatory body which will replace the DGCA and will meet standards set by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The CAA will have separate departments to deal with safety, economic regulation and grievance resolution, as well as a full-fledged environment department. It will also have an independent accident investigation bureau. The Authority will also have the autonomy to recruit staff. Currently, the DGCA is understaffed and does not have any recruitment powers. The CAA will have administrative and financial powers similar to those of the American FAA. These powers will redefine the regulator's role and better equip it to face the challenges of the growing Aviation sector in the country. Employees working with DGCA will be transferred to the CAA. The estimated cost of establishing the new Authority would be around Rs 11.2 million. The CAA would be self-financing and have a separate fund called the 'Civil Aviation Authority of India Fund' that would finance its entire expenses. It would have a Chairperson, a Director General and 7-9 members appointed by the Central Government. These members will be qualified in the fields of aviation safety, aircraft engineering, flight standard operations, aerodromes, air navigation systems and air space management. Air accident investigation Previously the DGCA conducted investigations and gave information to the investigations established by the Court of Inquiry and the Committee Inquiry. A separate investigative agency was established to comply with the Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Therefore, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) was established in 2011.\\"No. AV. 11012/01/2011 - PG \\" (Archive) Ministry of Civil Aviation. Retrieved on 16 March 2014.

It was unique in the way it choose the subject of its miniatures, using what they called the Liberty and Union League to produce models submitted by consumers.  Production process  The company used a \\"direct to digital\\" approach which did not use an original physical sculpt. This was unlike many other plastic wargames figure manufacturers who sculpted the figure at three times the eventual size (called three-ups), then digitally scanned and reduced them for production. In the design process the company used the software Freeform from Sensible (which in 2012 was bought by Geomagic).

Ideas are submitted by customers and then wait for approval by the Wargames Factory staff. Once the idea is approved as being viable it is listed on the Liberty and Union League, and on the Wargames Factory message boards on the company's website. After its listing, people are then able to pre-order sprues of that idea for a miniature.

The factory could then melt these down and use them in new frames of miniatures. As an incentive for participation in the program, the company entered the names of the participants into a raffle to win Wargames Factory products. This program has since been discontinued and no longer recycles old sprues, however Wargames Factory encourages wargamers to recycle their old sprues locally.

Biography Born at Morristown, New Jersey, Rodgers was a scion of one of the most famous naval families in American history. His great- uncle, Commodore John Rodgers, had commanded American forces during the First Barbary War and was the senior officer in the United States Navy at the outbreak of the War of 1812. His maternal great-grandfather was Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, who fought in the Quasi-War with France and was the father of naval heroes Oliver Hazard Perry and Matthew Calbraith Perry. Thomas Rodgers's father was Rear Admiral Christopher Raymond Perry Rodgers, and his older brother, Raymond Perry Rodgers, would also reach the rank of Rear Admiral. At one point or another during the first 25 years of the 20th century, five members of the Rodgers family were active flag officers in the U.S. Navy. Following in the family footsteps, therefore, Rodgers attended the United States Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1878. Details of his service during the first twenty years of his career are slim. It is known from sources, however, that he had achieved the rank of Lieutenant no later than 1894, when he served aboard . During and after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Rodgers served aboard . It is likely that this service included participation in the annexation of Wake Island on January 17, 1899. Promoted rapidly through the ranks following the end of the War, Rodgers served as executive officer of the battleship , with the rank of Commander, from 1902 to 1905. Varied service ashore and afloat led to promotion to the rank of Captain, and in 1910, Rodgers was given command of the battleship , the last pre-dreadnought built for the U.S. Navy. In 1911, he was appointed to the post of Supervisor of New York Harbor, and in 1912, Rodgers succeeded Captain Templin M. Potts to become Director of Naval Intelligence, a position largely developed by his older brother Raymond Perry Rodgers, the second holder of that office. In 1913, Rodgers was given command of the U.S. Navy's newest and most powerful dreadnought battleship, . Shortly after bringing her into commission on April 15, 1914, Rodgers took the New York south to the Gulf of Mexico, where she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher's squadron blockading Veracruz, Mexico. In 1915, Rodgers served as flag captain of Battleship Division One of the Atlantic Fleet, commanded by Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo. On June 13, 1916, Rodgers was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral and served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet before going ashore to study at the Naval War College, where he would remain through 1917. =World War I= , Admiral Rodgers's flagship during World War I, exercises with a kite balloon in Bantry Bay, Ireland. On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, entering World War I on the side of the Allies. As more and more American troops began to cross the Atlantic in 1918 for service on the Western Front, the Navy Department became increasingly worried about the threat posed by large German surface raiders breaking out into the Atlantic. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson, in particular, worried that if one or more of the German battlecruisers were to catch a weakly protected troop convoy, potentially thousands of American doughboys would be slaughtered. In response to this threat, the Navy Department decided to send a division of battleships to Berehaven, Ireland, to act as a guard force against the possibility of a battlecruiser raid. Rear Admiral Rodgers, then in command of Battleship Division Six of the Atlantic Fleet, was selected for this assignment. The division departed for Ireland on August 12, 1918. On October 14, 1918, Rodgers received word that German cruisers might have escaped into the Atlantic. At the time, two troop convoys were approaching European waters. Battleship Division Six put to sea without delay and escorted both convoys out of the danger zone. Despite the prompt action of Admiral Rodgers and the ships under his command, no German warships had been in the Atlantic, and the convoys were never in any danger. This false-alarm was the only raider-warning issued during Battleship Division Six's service in the warzone. At the end of the war, Admiral Rodgers returned to service in the Atlantic Fleet, commanding Battleship Division Seven. For his service during World War I, he was decorated with the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Rodgers retired from the Navy in July, 1919, after 41 years of service. =Death= Admiral Rodgers died on February 28, 1931, at the Polyclinic Hospital in New York City. According to The New York Times, Rodgers died suddenly, mere moments after being admitted. A lifelong bachelor, he was survived by his brother, Colonel Alexander Rodgers, and a sister, identified by The New York Times as \\"Mrs. Louis Nielsen.\\" Admiral Rodgers was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

It was between rivals claimants to the post of Baillie of the Regality. Background The conflict began after the monks of the Abbey of Aborath, appointed Alexander Lindsay, Master of Crawford as the \\"Bailie of the Regality\\", a position charged with dispensing justice throughout the jurisdiction of the monastery. The monks soon regretted this appointment, as Crawford began quartering large numbers of his men in the abbey, whose behaviour was considered by the monks to be vile and cruel. The monks described the Master of Crawford as \\"uneasy to convent\\", and soon dismissed him from his position. In his place they appointed Alexander Ogilvy, 2nd Baron of Inverquharity. Alexander Ogilvy not only had the right of election, but also had hereditary claims to the office. The Master of Crawford disputed the rights which Ogilvy claimed. When unable to reconcile the dispute, rather than arbitrate, they went to battle. The Master of Crawford, who would become the 4th Earl of Crawford, was the son of David Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Crawford, and son of Marjory Ogilvy, daughter of Alexander Ogilvie of Auchterhouse. The battle On 24 January 1445, the Master of Crawford arrived at the gates of the abbey with over one thousand men: mostly from clan Lindsay, but also a group of clan Hamilton from Clydesdale. Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity, was fortunate that he was entertaining guests on the day of the attack; Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly, Sir John Oliphant of Aberdagie, Maxwell of Tealing, Brucklay of Gartley, Forbes of Pitsligo, and Gordon of Borrowfield, were all in the Baron's company. Though outnumbered, Ogilvy and his allies drew up the lines of battle. Alexander Ogilvy's force was supported by men from Clan Oliphant, Clan Seton, Clan Gordon and Clan Forbes. Meanwhile, the Earl of Crawford rode with great haste from Dundee in order to avert hostilities. The Earl rode across the centre of the battlefield, between the two armies, in order to confer with Ogilvy. However, one of Ogilvy's infantry, mistook the Earl's approach for hostilities, and threw a spear, striking the Earl in the mouth, and piercing his neck, killing him instantly. Although an accident, this ended any chance for a peaceful resolution. The battle began, both lines with spears at the ready. It is said in an account of the battle by Buchanan, that the Lindsays cried out \\"Why do you bring those goads with you, as if you had to do with oxen? Pray, throw them away, and let us fight it out with out swords, hand to hand, by true valour, as becomes men.\\" As a result, both sides abandoned their spears, with the exception of a hundred of the Clydesdale men, who held the points of their spears in their hands behind them. When they entered combat, the Clydesdale men held the spears out, creating a spear wall, which broke the ranks of the Ogilvy line. The Ogilvy army left the Abbey, making a last desperate stand about three miles away, at the village of Leysmill, where they rallied and turned to face the pursuers. This second battle raged into the night, and Ogilvy and Pitsligo fell. The Lindsays, though victorious, suffered heavy casualties at Leysmill, and were unable to pursue the Ogilvys further when they fell back to Kinnell, the men carrying the bodies of Ogilvy and Pitsligo with them. It was determined that the body of Ogilvy should be interred in the aisle of the church in Kinnell. This couplet was engraved on the aisle where he was buried: \\"While the girss grows green and the water rins clear, Let nane but Ogilvys lie here\\". Aftermath Though the battle ended in Clan Lindsay's favor, they lost a disproportionate number of men, and the Earl of Crawford. Alexander Ogilvy, Forbes of Pitsligo, Brucklay of Gartley, Gordon of Borrowfield, and Sir John Oliphant of Aberdalgie perished. Following the battle, the Master of Crawford, who would later be known as ‚ÄúThe Tiger Earl of Crawford‚Äù, unleashed what remained of his army upon the lands of his enemies: ‚Äúand the flames of their castles, the slaughter of their vassals, the plunder of their property, and the captivity of their wives and children, instructed the remotest adherents of the Bailie of Aborath, how terrible was the vengeance which they had provoked.‚Äù From this time forward, clan Lindsay had an aversion to the color green, and from the battle originated the couplet: ‚ÄúAn Ogilvy in Green, Should never be seen‚Äù. It appears to have become a curse to the Lindsays, who were later defeated at the Battle of Brechin against the Earl of Huntley. The Earl of Crawford attributed this loss to the Lindsays being dressed primarily in green, much like the Ogilvys at Arborath. The body of Alexander Ogilvy, 2nd Baron of Inverquharity, was uncovered at the church of Kinnell village in 1885, during a demolition. A local tale stated that for hundreds of years, the large boots and spurs of the Baron hung over the aisle. The remains found were of a \\"gigantic\\" man, confirming the stories of the great stature of Ogilvy. The spur, having been recovered, now sits in the vestibule of the present church at Kinnell. Archaeology The graves of the dead from this battle have from time to time been found below the surface of the ground.

He was both chief executive officer and chair of Storebrand. Early life and World War II He was born in Steinkjer as a son of vicar Joachim Homboe Aarestrup (1866‚Äì1940) and his wife Anna Sophie Wiig (1872‚Äì1944). The family moved to Sagene two years later. He finished his secondary education in 1933, took Oslo Commerce School in 1934 and took the cand.jur. degree in 1938. He worked as a junior solicitor in Mysen until 1940, then briefly as a police officer in Oslo before being deputy judge in Farsund from 1940 to 1941. In July 1941, one year after the German invasion and occupation of Norway, Aarestrup was arrested for an attempt to flee the country. He was first imprisoned in Kristiansand's Arkivet, and later sat in M√∏llergata 19 from 8 to 22 August and in Grini concentration camp until mid- October 1941. In 1942 he left Farsund, being hired in the insurance company Storebrand. After a year as a secretary for the American finance attach√© in Sweden in 1944 and for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs-in exile in London from 1944 to 1945, he returned to Norway where he became foreign superintendent in Storebrand. Also, in 1943 he had married Ingrid Christie Krohn, daughter of professor Ivar Trygve Krohn and Ellen Christie. Later career He rose in the hierarchy, via board secretary from 1948, assisting director from 1954 and vice president from 1957 to 1961. He was the chief executive officer from 1965 to 1976. He then chaired the board until his retirement in 1982. In both 1965 and 1976 he succeeded Per M. Hansson. During his time as chief executive of Storebrand, he was also the chief executive of Custos, Europeiske, Hypotekforsikringsselskapet, Kreditt-Atlas and Oslo Assuranceselskap. In 1970 he also took over for Hansson as chief executive of Norr√∏na. From 1971 to 1974 Aarestrup chaired the Association of Norwegian Insurance Companies. In the mid-1980s Aarestrup was a proponent for a road tunnel to lead the European route E18 away from the city core of Oslo, specifically the square R√•dhusplassen. Since the tunnel would be built under the Oslofjord, the project was called Vannlinjen. In 1984 Aarestrup became a founding board chairman of the company of the same name. Board members were Ole S. Gilbo, Ragnar Hurum, Johan B. Holte, Olav Selvaag, Erling Storrusten and Jan Bille. As it turned out, the Festning Tunnel project, proposed by the company Fjellinjen, prevailed. In 1986, when the tides were turning for Fjellinjen, Aarestrup referred to the project as a \\"mis√®re from beginning to end\\". He was also a board member of Norske Fortuna, Livsforsikringsselskapet Idun, Equipment Leasing Company, Skips A/S Myken, A/S Fidelio, Victor Jenssens Rederi, Waages Tankrederi, Waages Tankrederi II, Forsikringsselskapet Viking, and until 1985 in Elektrisk Bureau. He chaired the supervisory council of A/S Rosshavet, A/S Vestfold, Rederi A/S Ruth, Norges Skibshypotekforening and Andresens Bank, and was a supervisory council member of Autotransport. From 1976 to 1979 he chaired the Norwegian branch of World Wildlife Fund. In politics he was a member of the so-called \\"economic committee\\" of the Conservative Party of Norway, which was responsible for collecting party funds. Fellow members were Bj√∏rn Bettum (chair), Johan H. Andresen, Per Chr. Frich, Aase Gudding and Per Str√∏m.

History  In 1958, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) established a division to research the use of ionizing radiation within chemical processes. They found it was not possible to use it as a catalyst, but found it could be used to assess/diagnose within the chemical process, typically ahead of plant turnarounds. In the 1960s the division was named Physics and Radioisotope Services, performing flow studies, heat exchanger leakage tests and column scans on a chemical plant in the UK. To support the work being done in hazardous areas, a range of Intrinsically safe radiation monitors were developed. Most of this early work was later recorded by Peter Jackson. In 1967, the first nuclear gauge was developed to measure the level within a vessel at Billingham chemical works. The Specialist Measurement Instruments section was established with a range of level, trip and Nuclear density gauges, typical application of which is slug catchers and separation vessels. A General Atomics Triga 250 kW Mark 1 nuclear reactor was operated from 1971 to 1998. This was used to create short half-life radioisotopes for use in chemical plant diagnostics, sample analysis and forensic work. In the 1970s, the business supported development North Sea oil industry, selling a range of services and nucleonic gauges. In the 1980s bases were established in Aberdeen, Scotland, Houston, Texas, Sarnia, Ontario and Edmonton, Alberta. Subsea gauges were developed for grout monitoring. Subsea nucleonic gauge level system was developed for Texaco Highlander Slug Catcher Tartan tieback. As well as techniques to assess and diagnose fluidised catalytic cracking units. In the 1990s, a range of Flooded Member Inspection and Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Tracking services used in pipeline pigging campaigns. Tracer technologies were developed to allow oil companies to characterise fluid flow in oil and gas reservoirs and inside production wells. The Tracerco Profiler entered the market in 2000, this Nuclear density gauge allows customers to see into their separator. This product received the Queen's Award for Innovation in 2003. In 2007, this instrument was deployed on Statoil's Tordis module, the world's first subsea oil and gas production facility. Imperial Chemical Industries sold the group to Johnson Matthey in 2002. The 2000's saw international expansion once again when Tracerco bought the Process Diagnostics division of QuestTruTec in 2006 to become the largest supplier of nucleonic diagnostic services currently in operation.. Regional expansion then followed with offices opening in Perth, Australia, Baku, Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi. In 2009, Tracerco announced the acquisition of Belgium-based Process Vision Services (PVS). The acquisition facilitated the provision of Tracerco's more extensive range of process tracing and characterisation technologies amongst clients throughout the refining and petrochemical industry in Europe and North Africa. Also in 2009, Tracerco was awarded its third Queen's Award for Enterprise. This was for the innovation of its radiation monitoring instruments that are certified with intrinsic safety. Discovery, the world's first subsea technology to provide medical grade CT scan information for pipeline inspection was launched to the world's oil and gas industry in 2013. Discovery can measure pipe wall thickness through any type of pipeline coating to allow operators to make decisions about the short, medium and long term future of a subsea pipeline.  Business Operations  The company has 8 business areas: * Instrumentation provides a full range of Nucleonic measurement solutions including level, density and interface measurement, which are certified for installation in hazardous areas and subsea. * Process Diagnostics can diagnose a wide range of production problems using sophisticated tracer and advanced measurement technology. * Subsea Technologies helps oil and gas operators better understand flow assurance issues and ensure the integrity of their subsea assets. * Radiation Monitors offers a range of Intrinsically Safe and Non-Intrinsically Safe Radiation Monitors, which can be used to measure radiation dose rate or characterise process and environmental contaminants. * Radiation Protection Advice and Radiation Protection Supervisor Training provide a range of services to ensure client operational safety and compliance with national and international Radiological legislation. * Reservoir Characterisation enable customers to optimise the recovery of hydrocarbons from both new and mature reservoirs. * Analytical Services offer a range of standard and bespoke analytical and diagnostic techniques. * Fuel Security provides a range of unique covert molecular markers, which are tailored to suit the application.

The episodes were originally broadcast in the United States on March 31, 1967, and April 7, 1967, on NBC. It, as does the television series, stars Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. It is the sixth such feature film that used as its basis a reedited version of one or more episodes from the series. Joan Crawford, Telly Savalas, Herbert Lom, Diane McBain, Jill Ireland, and Kim Darby are among those in the cast. The film was directed by Barry Shear and written by Norman Hudis with the story by Boris Ingster. Production The first four U.N.C.L.E. feature films made significant changes and additions to the episodes from which they were drawn. This movie, like the one immediately before it (‚ÄúThe Spy in the Green Hat‚Äù), makes relatively minimal changes to the episodes. No major scenes were added or removed, but various trims were made to fit the episodes into the running time of the film and musical cues and accompanying music was sometimes changed. Also changed were some short scenes that became more violent or sexy than generally shown on American network television at the time. For example, both the dead bodies of Amanda True and Randolph are shown with eyes closed in the TV episode; in the movie, their eyes are open and Randolph's death is more brutal. In some fight scenes, the movie version contains more violent images compared to the episodes (e.g., a bloody face in the London bar, greater violence in the Japanese temple). Margo De Fanzini's initial nudity is seen in both versions, but is more pronounced in the movie. Other changes were made for apparently no reason other than artistic. For example: there is a scene that is essentially identical in both the episode and the movie, but while in the episode a Japanese girl calls Sandy True ‚Äúkid‚Äù, in the movie the same girl calls her ‚Äúteeny-bopper‚Äù. Like One of Our Spies Is Missing, the film also required a new score (by Gerald Fried) due to \\"The Five Daughters Affair\\" being tracked with music from other episodes. Synopsis U.N.C.L.E. agents Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) are being attacked with missiles from small helicopters while on their way to see scientist Dr. Simon True (Jim Bowles). The attackers work for the villainous THRUSH organization. Although they fail to stop the agents, are the titular ‚ÄúKarate Killers‚Äù Dr. True has discovered a process to extract gold from sea water. Fearing theft, he hid the formula, saying someone would have to ‚Äúhunt down the four winds‚Äù to find it. But during his presentation of the process to U.N.C.L.E., he dies from apparently natural causes (though we later discover is due to Randolph's doing). True's dying words are that his daughter is the key to finding the formula. As the head of U.N.C.L.E., Alexander Waverly (Leo G. Carroll) informs Solo and Kuryakin that the dead man has four step-daughters and one biological daughter, Sandy True (Kim Darby). The consensus is that Dr. True sent each of his four step-daughters something that, when assembled, will mean something to Sandy and from which the formula can be discovered. Dr. True's widow, Amanda (Joan Crawford) was having a love affair with THRUSH operative Randolph (Herbert Lom), but he was only using her to get closer to Dr. True's notes and formula. With no further use for her, Randolph orders her murdered by the \\"Karate Killers\\". Finding her body, the agents recruit Sandy to come with them as they find her step-sisters. First, they visit Rome in search of Margo (Diane McBain), who has married Count Valeriano De Fanzini (Telly Savalas). The Count is keeping Margo naked and captive in his ancestral home, having married her for money only to learn she had none. Solo and Kuryakin rescue Margo, fight with Randolph and the Karate Killers (who have followed them to Rome), and are saved by Sandy's quick thinking. The Count and Margo make up after Sandy's discovery of a hidden treasure and give the U.N.C.L.E. team the only thing that Dr. True has sent Margo of late: a photograph of himself with an obvious formula in the picture. Analysis by U.N.C.L.E. shows the formula to be nonsense, so the agents conclude that it is one-quarter of the full formula. They next head to London, where they find Sandy's step-sister Imogen (Jill Ireland) arrested by a constable for indecent exposure (a bikini). Solo posts bail and they go to Imogen's nightclub, fight again with Randolph and the Karate Killers, then are saved by constables, one of whom (Terry-Thomas) catches Imogen's eye romantically. Sandy discovers a similar photo of her father in Imogen's dressing room, but with a different formula in the background. With half the four photos, the team heads to the Swiss Alps, where step-sister Yvonne (Danielle De Metz) lives in a hotel but is behind in paying her bills. Randolph, having gotten there before U.N.C.L.E., pays her debt and requests she give him the photo of her step-father. Solo and Kuryakin fight the Karate Killers on skis, and Sandy finds the photo before anyone else. Yvonne and wealthy boyfriend Carl (Curd Jurgens) resolve an argument and make up. Randolph intercepts the team on an U.N.C.L.E. private jet, takes the three photos, then parachutes out leaving the rest to die. Sandy is able to escape her bonds and frees the two agents. The plane lands safely. The fourth photo of Dr. True has been published in a magazine. U.N.C.L.E. determines that scientifically they are still make no sense. When the letters in the formulas are rearranged, they spell ‚ÄúJapanese Lullaby‚Äù. Sandy has no clue what this means but they take her to Japan anyway. Randolph, having determined the same thing, follows. The U.N.C.L.E. team is assaulted several times in Japan by the Karate Killers, Sandy is kidnapped but rescued by geishas. She finally remembers a Japanese man who sang her lullabies as a child. U.N.C.L.E. agents find the man, who gives Sandy the formula that her father sent him for safekeeping. At that moment Randolph and the Karate Killers, who have followed them again, overpower the team and take the formula. Randolph takes the three to the THRUSH central facility at the pole (north or south is not specified), which serves as their main research and manufacturing station. The facility has been reconfigured to use Dr. True's process and manufacture gold from sea water. Randolph wants to keep the captives alive long enough for them to see THRUSH's success, but Solo and Kuryakin escape from their cell using explosives hidden in Solo's shoelaces. They sabotage the plant and destroy the gold-making machinery. Randolph is killed in the process and covered in a film of gold dust. Solo, Kuryakin, Sandy, one of the geishas, and Waverly all travel to London to attend the double wedding of Imogen and the constable, and Yvonne and Carl. The Count and Contessa are also in attendance and it becomes clear that, absent a father, the girls' ‚ÄúU.N.C.L.E.‚Äù has paid for the weddings.

Biography Born in the wild in Asia, Fanny was purchased from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1958 by the City of Pawtucket for $2,500. Fanny became a symbol of the city and spent more than three decades in Pawtucket at the Slater Park Zoo, now called Daggett Farm. While at the Slater Park Zoo, once named one of the worst zoos in America by the TV show 60 Minutes, Fanny was housed in a small barn, with only a tiny, barren enclosure in which to walk and was also chained by her back leg. In 1993, the city council closed the zoo, but citizens clashed over Fanny's fate. Mayor Robert Metvier was accused of playing politics for trying to keep her there after the council voted to let her leave Pawtucket. A coalition of groups including the HSUS, the Free Fanny Coalition, and the Fund for AnimalsThe Fund for Animals website eventually won her freedom, and, during the night of June 7, 1993, she began her 36-hour journey to the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison, Texas.Black Beauty Ranch website While at the ranch, Fanny, renamed Tara, dropped of unhealthy weight and was given something she had not had in decades‚Äîan elephant companion named Conga. Fanny lived at the Black Beauty ranch until her death in August 2003. She was 63 years old, according to the ranch. Upon learning of her death, The Providence Journal ran an obituary for Fanny. In 2007, the City of Pawtucket dedicated a fiberglass sculpture to her, which stands within sight of Fanny's barn.

Guide to modern Japanese woodblock prints: 1900‚Äì1975. University of Hawaii Press, 1995; p. 768936) (June 10, 1895 ‚Äì March 31, 1950) was a Japanese painter, illustrator, and printmaker known for his association with the y≈çga movement of the early 20th century. His work is considered representative of the Taish≈ç period in Japanese art. Michisei was born in Isezaki, Gunma Prefecture, the son of Kohno Jiro, a painter, teacher of art and portrait photographer who was also a member of the Japanese Orthodox Church; some sources state that he grew up in Nagano City. The elder Kohno also had an extensive library, which provided further inspiration for his son. Michisei soon fell under the influence of painter Kishida Ry≈´sei, and joined the latter's Sodosha movement in 1915; he also exhibited at times with Kokugakai, Nikakai, Shun'yokai, and Bunten. After Kishida's death Kohno turned increasingly to illustration, producing artwork for a number of novels published during the Sh≈çwa period and working for a variety of newspapers. Beginning in 1931 he was a member of Nihon Hanga Kyokai, and he exhibited his paintings sporadically between 1933 and 1937. Among the subjects he illustrated was the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. He also produced woodblock prints during his career, and served as art director for one film directed by Kazunobu Shigemune for Toho Studios, Matsushita mura juku, in 1939. Sekine Shoji was influenced by his work. Stylistically, perhaps Kohno's greatest influence was the work of Albrecht D√ºrer, which he knew, as did most of his Japanese artistic contemporaries, primarily from books and magazines; indeed, the pose, color scheme, costume, and background of his Self-Portrait of 1917 indicate his familiarity with the German master's Self Portrait at Twenty- Eight Years Old Wearing a Coat with Fur Collar of 1500. The work of Michelangelo, too, provided much of Kohno's inspiration, as did the Christian faith. He repeatedly touched upon Christian themes in his work, blending them with unorthodox elements; for instance, he depicted Adam and Eve crossing the river Susobana upon their expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and painted the Virgin Mary nude at the center of his painting of the Nativity. Kohno also showed some interest in self-portraiture, returning to the medium numerous times throughout his career. Kohno died in Koganei, Tokyo prefecture, in 1950, and was soon forgotten; he was, however, the subject of a 2008 retrospective at the Hiratsuka Museum of Art in Tokyo, which traveled to the Ashikaga Museum of Art, the Shoto Museum of Art, and a museum in Nagano Prefecture. Two of his paintings, a self-portrait and a portrait of his son Shuntatsu, are currently in the collection of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C.; his work may also be seen in numerous museums in Japan, including the Hiratsuka Museum of Art, the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art and the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. A drawing is owned by the Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura & Hayama. Notes References * Merritt, Helen and Nanako Yamada. (1995). Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints, 1900‚Äì1975.

At Jena he had as instructors Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762‚Äì1836) and philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762‚Äì1814). In 1797 he obtained his medical doctorate with a dissertation on the diagnosis and treatment of melancholia. He worked for a period of time as a physician in a madhouse in Torgau, and from 1805 to 1810 was director of a psychiatric institute at Bayreuth. Later in his career he was appointed director of Prussian Health Services, where he wielded influence on the overall development of Prussian mental hospitals. During his tenure at Bayreuth he made efforts at transforming a former penitentiary-madhouse into a place of treatment for the mentally ill, having limited success. As a psychiatrist he equated mental illness with uncontrolled passions, and defined treatment as establishing control of reason over passions by educational means.

A naturally occurring soil bacterium Agrobacterium rhizogenes that contains root-inducing plasmids (also called Ri plasmids) can infect plant roots and cause them to produce a food source for the bacterium, opines, and to grow abnormally. The abnormal roots are particularly easy to culture in artificial media because hormones are not needed in contrast to adventitious roots, and they are neoplastic, with indefinite growth. The neoplastic roots produced by A. rhizogenes infection have a high growth rate (compared to untransformed adventitious roots), as well as genetic and biochemical stability. Currently the main constraint for commercial utilization of hairy root culture is the development and up-scaling of appropriate (bioreactors) vessels for the delicate and sensitive hairy roots. Some of the applied research on utilization of hairy root cultures has been and is conducted at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. Other labs working on hairy roots are the phytotechnology lab of Amiens University and the Arkansas Biosciences Institute.  Metabolic studies  Hairy root cultures can be used for phytoremediation, and are particularly valuable for studies of the metabolic processes involved in phytoremediation. Further applications include detailed studies of fundamental molecular, genetic and biochemical aspects of genetic transformation and of hairy root induction.  Genetically transformed cultures  The Ri plasmids can be engineered to also contain T-DNA, used for genetic transformation (biotransformation) of the plant cells. The resulting genetically transformed root cultures can produce high levels of secondary metabolites, comparable or even higher than those of intact plants.  Use in plant propagation  Hairy root culture can also be used for regeneration of whole plants and for production of artificial seeds.

Design and reception The Neo-Renaissance structure has a nave, two aisles and measures long by wide. There are 124 Corinthian columns. Twelve statues representing the twelve months of the year sit above the portico. There is a raised orchestra space for the spa orchestra which plays regular, free concerts. Architect Josef Z√≠tek, who also designed the National Theatre and Rudolfinum in Prague, designed the structure, which was built between 1871-1881. The original design called for a two level colonnade, but a lack of funds restricted it to one level. Construction proceeded very slowly and costs grew higher. The structure was initially reviled by critics and compared to a bed of carrots or a bowling alley; at the time it was finished, many believed it had blemished the center of town.Balneology and Mineral Springs, Information Center of the City of Karlovy Vary, Accessed June 9, 2009.

The spring was named after an old mill which used to stand in the area. * Rock Spring (), , originally rose next to the nearby Tepla River ; in 1845 the spring was diverted to the current location of the Mill Colonnade. * Libu≈°e Spring, , is a merger of four smaller springs, and was originally named the \\"Spring of Elizabeth's Roses\\". * Nymph Spring (), , was known prior to 1945 as the \\"New Spring\\" and had its own colonnade before the Mill Colonnade replaced it. * Prince V√°clav I Spring, , was originally one of the strongest springs in the area in both yield and force, and was used to produce curative salt. A second spring, Prince V√°clav II Spring, , comes from the same source and flows out several meters in front of the Mill Colonnade. Accessed March 13, 2012.

History Paradigm was organized as a charter school under the Utah State Department of Education. It received its charter on July 13, 2005, and opened in September 2006. Academic Performance 2 years ago The Utah State Board Of Education gave Paradigm High School an F grade (based on a 38% proficiency on the SAGE test) for its performance in the 2015-2016 school year. These rankings are based primarily on the SAGE test scores. Coincidentally, Paradigm also has one of the highest opt out rates for the SAGE test at 54% testing in the state. Due to the high SAGE opt-out rate by parents, Paradigm uses the ACT for internal performance tracking. The school has administered the ACT to all High School grades twice per year since the 2014/2015 school year. For those years, the student ACT opt out rate has been below 5% and average ACT scores have been equal to or slightly better than state averages. Ethnic diversity As of the 2016-2017 school year, Paradigm High is in the bottom 1/3 of schools for ethnic diversityhttps://www.schools.utah.gov/file/68bf784e-5cf4-48c1-a5c7-c3eb943cbb6d. At 14%, Paradigm has a slightly higher ethnic diversity than the city in which it operates (South Jordan),https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/southjordancityutah/PST045217 which has an ethnic diversity of 9.1%. Courses Paradigm offers a variety of courses in addition to standard courses, such as Novel Writing, AP Environmental Science, and taekwondo. Among its wide variety of English courses are one on the writings of C.S. Lewis, and classes about Western and Eastern World, French, Gothic, and British (including Shakespeare) literature. It also offers Latin, ASL, German, Spanish and French. =Leadership= Unique to Paradigm High School is a class called Leadership, which is offered in three levels: Foundations, Transitions, and Scholar. Its focus varies at each level: *Foundations is a course rooted in the fundamentals of a Paradigm education: study habits, goal-setting, personal accountability, self- reflection, and the basics of group discussion and shared inquiry, as well as an introduction to great books, people, and ideas. It is for students just starting on their path towards self-education. *Transitions is a course that is, indeed, a transition; geared toward students who have started along the scholar path, the goal of this course is to provide practical experience in the Paradigm model, while helping the students to develop a sense of their own individual mission. *Scholar is the most advanced Leadership course: a rigorous study of great literature and ideas, as well as their practical application. This is preparatory for the students' continuing education and experiences beyond Paradigm. This course is now integrated into the Seminar Course, which is a classics-based blend of English, Leadership, History that meets in a double block class. Athletics As a small, liberal arts high school, Paradigm is not a member of UHSAA and therefore does not participate in the high school athletics program. Students can choose to participate in their local District high school athletics programs while attending Paradigm in order to get the best of both worlds. Paradigm does support a strong intramural sports program, with the basketball teams receiving second place (girls') and first place (boys'), and the girls' volleyball team winning second place. Paradigm offers Standard PE classes as well as Dance and TaeKwonDo. Extracurricular activities Paradigm has many extracurricular activities and competitive teams. The Paradigm Chess Team (PCT) took third in the 1A-3A division in the Utah High School Chess Championships two years in a row,.https://secure6.userservices.net/clarkwork.com/utahchess/index.php?showpage=results.php&event;=124&result;=76 Paradigm also supports an excellent Academic Decathlon team. In March 2011, they beat reigning state champions Park City High in Super Quiz, one of 10 categories, and the most competitive, by 5 points out of a possible 6,000. New in 2011-2012 was a mock trial team. Their first competition was February 24, 2012 against Mountain View High School. More recently, in 2016, the Mock Trial team advanced past the first round of competition and competed again a few weeks later.

The album was subsequently released on 5 October 2009 on Cooking Vinyl. Prior to recording, guitarist Rod Jones revealed that the album has \\"quite an upbeat musical feel,\\" and that it sounds \\"like a band having a good time.\\" Upon the album's traditional release, Jones stated: \\"I think the way we approached making this record, and doing things ourselves and involving our fans just gave us the freedom and time to do what we wanted to do without any pressure. I think it has been a turning point for us.\\" The album peaked at No. 90 in the UK Album Charts in its first week of physical release. It might have charted higher but the band sold a number of pre-order copies via their website, which is not a registered chart company. The album's first single, \\"Readers & Writers\\" was released digitally on 28 September. The album was performed in full on 19 May 2009 at Dingwalls, in London. Background and recording Following the release of Make Another World, Idlewild's label, Sanctuary Records, went into administration, leaving the band without a recording contract. Idlewild subsequently decided to release their next studio album directly to their fanbase. In November 2008, the band launched a new website, www.idlewildmusic.com, with the following message: Those that pre-ordered the album received fifteen exclusive live tracks from the band's recent King Tut's residency, blog entries from band members and exclusive video footage from the recording process. According to vocalist Roddy Woomble, the first track written for Post Electric Blues was album opener \\"Younger Than America\\". Influenced by Westerns and Neil Young & Crazy Horse, Woomble states that: Regarding the album's lyrical content, Woomble states that he wanted \\"to have a more off-the-cuff feel to the record\\". In early January 2009, the band entered pre-production with frequent producer Dave Eringa at their rehearsal space in Rosyth, Fife. In February, Idlwild and Eriga decamped to a converted farm house in Bethesda, Wales, near Snowdonia National Park, to record the album. The band spent two weeks recording the album in Wales, before returning to Scotland to add overdubs from additional musicians, John Blackshaw, John McCusker and Heidi Talbot at Chem19 Studios. By March, guitarist Rod Jones and Eringa had relocated to Eringa's house in London to being mixing the album. At this time, Jones began recording his debut solo album, A Sentimental Education using Eringa's equipment. The album was subsequently posted to fans in June 2009, and released on 5 October 2009 on Cooking Vinyl records.

He was known best for his novels and short stories set in San Francisco and featuring the fictional \\"Dan Kearney and Associates\\" (the \\"DKA Files\\") private investigation firm specializing in repossessing cars, a thinly veiled escalation of his own experiences as a confidential sleuth and repo man. Gores was also recognized for his novels Hammett (1975; made into the 1982 film Hammett), Spade & Archer (the 2009 prequel to Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon) and his Edgar Award-winning or -nominated works, such as A Time of Predators, 32 Cadillacs and Come Morning. Work Gores was a three- time Edgar Award winner, and only one of three authors (the other two being Donald E. Westlake and William L. DeAndrea) to receive Edgars in three separate categories; Gores won Best First Novel (for A Time of Predators (1969)--a story set in the San Francisco Bay Area and having to do with a Stanford University professor who re-learns his military commando skills in order to go after a gang of juvenile thugs who raped his wife), Best Short Story (\\"Goodbye, Pops,\\" Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, Dec. 1969) and Best TV Series Segment (for writing an episode of the crime drama Kojak titled \\"No Immunity for Murder\\"--airdate Nov. 23, 1975). In addition, Gores received the 1986 Maltese Falcon Award (Japan's highest commendation in the mystery fiction field) and the Private Eye Writers of America lifetime achievement award (The Eye), and he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.supra, n.1 His novels 32 Cadillacs and Come Morning were nominated for Best Novel Edgars.supra, n.2 Beyond Kojak, Gores composed teleplays and screenplays for popular mystery-related series such as Remington Steele, B.L. Stryker, Mrs. Columbo, and Magnum, P.I..  Literary crossovers  Westlake and Joe Gores wrote the same encounter between two of their characters from different perspectives in two different novels. In Chapter 18 of Gores' 1972 novel Dead Skip, San Francisco detective Dan Kearney meets Westlake's amoral thief Parker while looking for one of Parker's associates. The sequence is described from Parker's viewpoint in the 1972 book Plunder Squad, which Westlake wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark. Gores hints further at the connection between the two books by referring to Parker's associates as \\"the plunder squad.\\" Additionally, earlier in the novel, the book's protagonist Larry Ballard is described as being a reader only of Richard Stark novels. Gores and Westlake also wrote a shared chapter in Westlake's Drowned Hopes and Gores' 32 Cadillacs, having the characters in those books influenced by the same event. Background Gores lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and was a longtime resident. He obtained a degree in English literature from Notre Dame University and received a master's degree, also in English literature, from Stanford University in 1961.MysteryNet.com, \\"Why I Write Mysteries\\" Mystery Writing by Joe Gores, Gores worked for 12 years as a real-life private investigator for San Francisco's David Kikkert & Associates,William Grimes, The New York Times, \\"Joe Gores, Crime Writer in Dashiell Hammett Mode, Dies at 79,\\" Jan. 13, 2011 and put in other stints as a truck driver, logger, assistant motel manager and an English teacher at a boys' school in Kenya. In his novels he used variations of the names of former associates--such as Stan Groner. According to The Thrilling Detective Web Site, \\"He has often relied on his former occupations, particularly his stint as a private eye, to lend an air of authenticity to his work, blasting through the 'glamour' of detective work, [and] showing the drudgery and grunt work of detection.\\" Gores died in a Marin County, California, hospital 50 years to the day after Dashiell Hammett died.

He was the father of John Major, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1990-97. Early life He was born Abraham Thomas Ball in Bloxwich, Staffordshire, on 18 May 1879. He was a son of Abraham Ball, a bricklayer, and his wife Sarah Ann Marrah or O'Marrah who was of Irish and possibly Welsh descent.Edward J. Davies, \\"The Ancestry of Sir John Major\\", Genealogists' Magazine, 29(2007‚Äì09):335-40. The family also had an adopted son, Alfred. When he was five years old, Major-Ball and his parents emigrated to the United States, where he spent his formative years in Pennsylvania, where his father worked as a steel worker, initially in Pittsburgh, then Philadelphia, and finally Fall Hollow, a small village near Braddock. He later worked as a vaudeville performer and trapeze artist in travelling circuses. Early adult life and stage career Circa 1896 the family moved back to the UK, to the Walsall area, where Tom Major developed a successful music hall career. He claimed to have performed at \\"every theatre in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland\\". In 1901 Major fathered an illegitimate child (Tom Moss) with Mary Moss, a married woman. His music hall act was as a comedian and song-and-dance man, chiefly with Kitty Grant; a relationship grew, though this remained secret as Kitty was married. Kitty called herself Drum for the stage effect of \\"Drum and Ball\\"; Tom later added \\"Major\\" to the name when the double act was renamed \\"Drum and Major\\". He sometimes performed under the name Tom Major. In July 1903 he and Kitty toured for a year in South America, where Major worked for period as a ranch-hand in Argentina and later at a casino in Buenos Aires, before getting caught up in a civil war in Uruguay, where he was forced to enlist in a local militia. On the couples' return to the United Kingdom in April 1904 they resumed touring music halls and their performing careers flourished. On 18 February 1906, he and Kitty became founder members at the creation of the Variety Artistes' Federation at the Vaudeville Club in London. They later married in 1910, following the death of Kitty's husband David Grant. A heart condition prevented Tom from enlisting for active service in the First World War. In 1923 Major had an affair with Alice Maud Frankland, which resulted in the birth of a child, Kathleen, on 6 October 1923. Kitty died in June 1928 following a stage accident in which she was struck by a steel beam. With music halls suffering a decline as cinemas became more popular with the public, Tom gave up his performing career in 1930. Later career and life Tom married the dancer Gwendolyn (Gwen) Minny Coates on 4 May 1929, who had helped nurse Kitty in her final weeks. With his stage career now over, the couple moved to 260 Longfellow Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, where he founded Major's Garden Ornaments, manufacturing garden gnomes and other garden ornaments. The couple had four children: Thomas Aston (b. June 1929, who died shortly after birth), Pat Major-Ball (b. 1930), Terry Major-Ball (b. July 1932), and John Major (b. 29 March 1943). The ornaments business prospered and the family achieved a reasonable middle-class standard of living, described by John Major as being \\"comfortable but not well off.\\" The family owned a car, and both Pat and Terry were able to go to private school. This was not to last however, as the Second World War saw the business lose most of its customers and suppliers. By the early 1950s the business was in such serious trouble that Tom Major was forced to seek out a loan which was then recalled, resulting in severe financial difficulties for the family. The family were no longer able to afford to live in Worcester Park, and they moved to a cramped rented flat at Coldharbour Lane, Brixton owned by Tom Moss, Major's (illegitimate) son. Tom Major sought to move the family to Canada, but his application was rejected due to his poor eyesight. Terry kept the business going, and it was later sold in 1959. The money from the sale enabled the family to move to a larger residence at 80 Burton Road, Brixton. Tom Major-Ball died on 27 March 1962. It is claimed by John Major that when his father was dying, \\"every act in the country trooped through to perform at the bed of their dying fellow artiste.\\" His widow, Gwen, outlived him by more than eight years; dying in September 1970 at the age of 65, shortly before John's marriage to Norma Wagstaff. After John Major became Prime Minister, there was considerable media interest in his father's colourful background. Journalist Bruce Anderson described Tom Major-Ball as \\"one of the most fascinating characters of the century\\". Legacy It has been suggested by Bowie expert Nicholas Pegg that David Bowie got the idea of the character Major Tom's name in his song Space Oddity from seeing an old circus poster featuring fellow Brixton resident Tom Major.

J. Nagar) is a residential neighborhood in north-western Chennai, India. It is located west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Road (Inner Ring Road) and is part of the Ambattur zone (7) of the Greater Chennai Corporation. There are industrial estates to the north and west, namely Padi and Ambattur. The abundance of highly reputed schools, specialized hospitals and the recent influx of IT offices in the industrial estates in and around it have catapulted Mogappair into a strategic location for business. The Mangal Lake in the North Western part of Mogappair is the largest park in this region. A few decades ago, Mogappair was a small village, a part of which is still intact in the south-western part of Mogappair. Mogappair is divided into two parts, namely Mogappair East and Mogappair West. Etymology There was a lake called Mugapeeri, from which the name of the locality was derived. After persistent mispronunciation, the name 'evolved' to its present form (Mogappair). Childless couples visit the temple in the locality and offer their prayers, and it is said that their wishes come true after the visit.The word for people in Tamil is \\"Makkal\\" and the fortune to possess anything is described by the word - \\"Peru\\". Hence, this place was originally called \\"Makkal-Peru\\" meaning \\"Fortune of begetting children\\". This name has later undergone linguistic modification to the modern-day name \\"Mogappair\\". Till date, many couple visit \\"Shri Santhana Srinivasa Perumal, temple\\" located in the west of Mogappair praying to be blessed with progeny. History Mogappair in the beginning used to be a forest during the British era. A river used to flow in between the area now called as Eri scheme. Location Mogappair is located on SH112 highway between Ambattur and Anna Nagar. Mogappair East and Mogappair West are twin localities which share and complement much of their resources and infrastructures alike. It is well connected by road & rail links. Located close to Ambattur, all west and east bound trains can be boarded from Ambattur, Pattaravakkam and Korattur. Long distance bus & Indian Railways reservation counters are available in CMBT which is 3 km from Mogappair and Chennai International Airport is around 16 km from here. The nearest Metro Rail Stations are located in Thirumangalam and Koyambedu. The Chennai bypass road NH4 joins from SH-112 near Ambattur and is Southbound towards Maduravoyal and Perungalathur. An underpass to access NH-4 from Ambattur is open for traffic on SH-112 between Nolambur and Ayappakkam. Mogappair East was the first to be inhabited followed by Mogappair West and Nolambur. Transportation Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) runs passenger buses from Mogappair to major parts of the Chennai City. There are four bus terminals in Mogappair. They are J.J Nagar East, J.J.Nagar West (Mogappair East and Mogappair West), Mogappair Officer's Colony (Elango Nagar) and Mogappair (Mogappair Village). The nearest Metro Rail Station is Thirumangalam and Koyambedu. =Bus transport= Bus is the major mode of transport for the people of Mogappair. The locality is served by a bus terminus on Third Main Road. The terminus was developed by the Local Area Development Fund, including cementing the entire surface, construction of time keeper's office, water facilities and toilets and erecting two 60-foot-high high-mast lamps, one each at the entrance and at the exit. About 50,000 people use these terminus daily, from where about 50 buses on 15 routes are being operated daily, making about 400 trips daily. Mogappair Officer's Colony (Elango Nagar) is located on the Officer's Colony Road near Ambattur Estate Road. The frequency of buses, however, is very low from this terminal. Mogappair has a small bus stand on Venugopal Street between the east and the west bus terminals. Mogappair East Bus Terminus The Mogappair East terminus was opened in 1990. Located on Paari Salai and spread over a 1.5-acre area, it operates 21 buses a day, serving about 5,000 commuters daily. It was renovated in 2015 at a cost of 6 million. Mogappair West bus terminus The terminus at Mogappair West was renovated in 2012. About 39 buses on 12 routes are being operated daily, with the vehicles making about 280 trips on a daily basis. The terminus serves about 30,000 commuters daily.

In the category of the members of the College of Cardinals in the central Middle Ages (11th to 13th century), an external cardinal (as opposed to a \\"curial cardinal\\"Ganzer, p. XI. See also Maleczek, p. 53, 125 and 295‚Äì296; Zenker, p. 248‚Äì249; Loud, p. 241.) was a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church who did not reside in the Roman Curia, because of simultaneously being a bishop of the episcopal see other than suburbicarian, or abbot of an abbey situated outside Rome.Ganzer, p. XI; Maleczek, p. 53 In the wider sense, it may also concern cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees and resigned their memberships in the College of Cardinals with this appointment. As well, it can concern cardinals who were generally curial cardinals, but for some time exercised the posts of administrators or prelates of the external churches.Ganzer, p. 186, 189, 193‚Äì194; cf. Zenker, p. 249 Today, the great majority of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached.Salvador Miranda General list of Cardinals: 5th Century (492-498) (note) and Guide to documents and events. Florida International University. Retrieved on August 27, 2009. This jurisdiction has been finally suppressed only in 1692 see Salvador Miranda The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church.Guide to documents and events. 17th Century (1605‚Äì1700) Florida International University. Retrieved on August 27, 2009 The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals ‚Äì members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome ‚Äì cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.  History  = Origins and development = At least eight abbots of Monte Cassino between 1057‚Äì1259/62 were simultaneously cardinals of the Holy Roman Church. The College of Cardinals originated from the college of the main clergy of the city of Rome. The title of cardinal initially concerned only the priests of the 28 parochial churches of the Eternal City (tituli), who were required to assist the pope in the liturgical service in the four Basilicas of Rome (Vatican Basilica, Liberian Basilica, Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura).Klewitz, p. 47. Later (probably in the 8th century) the term was extended to the bishops of the seven dioceses bordering the diocese of Rome: Ostia, Porto, Albano, Palestrina, Silva Candida (1079 replaced by Segni), Gabii-Lavicum (whose name later changed to Tusculum, and later to Frascati) and Velletri (after 1060 replaced by Sabina). These bishops (cardinal-bishops) performed the liturgical service in the Lateran Basilica.Klewitz, p. 24‚Äì36. Finally, the deacons serving in the papal household or heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city (and later attached to the churches called deaconries), also became the cardinals (cardinal-deacons).The term ‚Äúcardinal-deacons‚Äù is known already in the 6th century, but in the official papal documents does not appear before the last quarter of the 11th century. H√ºls, p. 17; Klewitz, p. 88. The cardinals of the Holy Roman Church up to the 11th century had strictly liturgical duties and generally took no part in the government of the Church. Cardinal bishops were equal to the other bishops, even if celebrating the rite of consecration of the new pope gave them considerable prestige, while the dignity of the cardinal priest or deacon was considered lower than that of a bishop. The liturgical service in the five patriarchal basilicas of Rome, as well as day pastoral duties in constant presence of the cardinals at Rome.On the early Roman cardinalate see Klewitz, p. 14‚Äì31, 47‚Äì60 and 79‚Äì87; H√ºls, p. 3‚Äì44; Robinson, p. 33‚Äì34; Ganzer, p. 4‚Äì6; and This situation started to gradually change with the ascension of Pope Leo IX (1049‚Äì1054) and the beginning of the Reform Papacy. This pope, in order to reform the corrupted Roman clergy, appointed several new cardinals from the monastic centers outside Rome, such as Monte Cassino, Remiremont and Cluny. These new cardinals became his close advisors. Leo‚Äôs successors continued this trend and Nicholas II in 1059 gave the cardinals the exclusive right to elect a new pope.Robinson, pp. 57 ff. At the end of the 11th century the boca formed a single College of Cardinals, which became the main body of the papal government ‚Äî they served as experts or judges in the legal causes (auditors), countersigned the solemn papal privileges, acted as governors of the cities or provinces of the Papal States or were sent by the popes on important diplomatic missions. The cardinals became the most important members of the Roman Curia, and as such were still required to reside in the papal court, unless they were dispatched for a legatine mission in the name of the pope.For the development of the role of cardinals in the 11th century and the establishment of the College of Cardinals see Robinson, p. 35‚Äì41; Ganzer, p. 6‚Äì11; Klewitz, p. 31‚Äì47, 60‚Äì79 and 88‚Äì114. For the detailed study about the engagement of the cardinals in papal government in 12th and 13th centuries see Maleczek, pp. 297‚Äì351; and Robinson, pp.90‚Äì120. Bernardo degli Uberti was simultaneously a cardinal and abbot of Vallombrosa. In 1106 he became bishop of Parma and resigned his cardinalate with this appointment Almost simultaneously to the development of the College of Cardinals as a body of papal advisors, the popes started to elevate to the cardinalate some \\"external\\" abbots. After such appointments, they continued to reside in their abbeys and did not become members of the Papal curia. On the other hands, the elections of the cardinals to the posts of abbots of external monasteries were also ratified by the popes.Ganzer, p. 176. The main goal of such appointments was probably to strengthen the ties between some important monastic centers with the Roman Church. The first known instances of such appointments concerned the abbey of Montecassino, one of the main centers supporting reform of the Church.Klewitz, p. 103, described Monte Cassino as \\"spiritual armoury of the reform papacy\\" In 1057 cardinal-deacon Frederick de Lorraine (the future pope Stephen X) was elected abbot of Montecassino; Pope Victor II confirmed his election and simultaneously named him cardinal-priest of S. Crisogono.Ganzer, p. 15‚Äì16 no. 1; H√ºls, p. 168‚Äì169 no. 2. His successor as abbot of Montecassino, Desiderio, was also quickly promoted to the cardinalate, but continued to act also as abbot.Ganzer, p. 17‚Äì23 no. 2; H√ºls, p. 154‚Äì155 no. 1. From 1057 until 1259/62 at least eight abbots of Montecassino were simultaneously members of the College of Cardinals.Ganzer, p. 185 Also some other Italian (e.g. Subiaco, Farfa, Vallombrosa, S. Sophia in Benevento) and French abbeys (St Victor at Marseille) were for some time ruled by the cardinal-abbots. During the Investiture Controversy, both the legitimate Popes as well as Antipope Clement III developed another, not entirely new, practice.For example, already in 1050 cardinal-priest Airardus was appointed bishop of Nantes (H√ºls, p. 212 no. 3; cf. Gams, p. 581) They appointed their cardinals to the important Episcopal sees in Italy in order to assure their government by their own trusted collaborators.Ganzer, p. 189‚Äì190 Antipope Clement III named cardinals Hugo Candidus and Roberto of S. Marco bishops of Fermo and Faenza respectively.Ganzer, p. 38‚Äì39 no. 10 and p. 190; H√ºls, p. 185 no. 3 Popes Victor III and Urban II appointed their cardinals to the episcopal sees of Brescia (Herimanus) and Reggio-Emilia (Bonussenior). The practice was continued by successive popes, who named their cardinals particularly to the recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento).Loud, p. 216‚Äì217; Ganzer, p. 55‚Äì69, 72‚Äì75 and 190‚Äì191. The southern Italy for several hundred years belonged to the Byzantine Empire and was ecclesiastically subordinated to the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople, not to Rome. It was only after the Norman conquest of southern Italy in the 11th century, when the papacy was able to regain the control over this region and to replace the Greek hierarchy with the Latin one; see Klewitz, pp. 137‚Äì205. Also, three successive archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133‚Äì1137/38), Balduino (1138‚Äì1145) and Villano Caetani (1146‚Äì1175) were initially the cardinals.Ganzer, p. 86‚Äì91, 97‚Äì99; Robinson, p. 91; Zenker, p. 248 Coat of arms of Guillaume aux Blanches Mains, archbishop of Reims and cardinal-priest of S. Sabina Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159‚Äì1181), all the cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees, resigned their membership in the College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which clearly shows that the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon.Robinson, p. 91; Ganzer, p. 187‚Äì189 On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals.The only exception was archbishop Rangerius of Reggio di Calabria 1091‚Äì94/95, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Susanna in 1094/95 and resigned his see, though probably retaining the personal title of archbishop. On Rangerius see H√ºls, p. 207‚Äì208 no. 2, who has amended in some points Rangerius‚Äô entry by Ganzer, p. 45‚Äì49 no. 14. Pope Gregory VII in 1073 elevated to the cardinalate also Atto, archbishop-elect of Milan from 1072; but Atto was unable to take possession of his see due to political reasons and never received episcopal consecration (H√ºls, p. 185 no. 2; Gams, p. 796; cf. Kehr, vol. VI/1, p. 49‚Äì52 no. 101‚Äì120) Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities.The only exception concerned bishops of the seven dioceses bordering the diocese of Rome (suburbicarian sees), who were the cardinals ex officio. Robinson, p. 91 However, during Alexander‚Äôs pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of the cardinals leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops.Ganzer, p. 194‚Äì199; Robinson, p. 91 Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest.See Ganzer, p. 132‚Äì133 no. 54, p. 196; Brixius, p. 67 no. 1 The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal- priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz.Ganzer, p. 104‚Äì114 no. 43, p. 195‚Äì196 Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims;Ganzer, p. 125‚Äì129 no. 51 similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of Novara, elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively.Maleczek, p. 68, 94‚Äì97 and 125. The case of Ruggiero, archbishop of Benevento (1179‚Äì1221) and cardinal of S. Eusebio (attested as such in 1180) remains obscure, with the contradictory statements of the historians (cf. on him Brixius, p. 66 no. 29; Ganzer, 129‚Äì131 no. 52; and Maleczek, p. 68 and 295) On the other hand, when cardinal- priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became equal to that of bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.For example, in September 1173 Alexander III named bishop-elect of Meaux, Pietro da Pavia, to the rank of cardinal-priest of S. Crisogono, and in 1175 forced him to resign his see (Ganzer, p. 123‚Äì125 no. 50). In 1182, Pedro de Cardona, archbishop-elect of Toledo, was named cardinal-priest of S. Lorenzo in Damaso by Lucius III and from the document dated 3 June 1182 appears that he resigned the see of Toledo: P(etro)‚Ä¶presbitero Cardinali, quondam electo vestro (Ram√≥n Riu y Cabanas, Primeros cardenales de la sede primada, in: Bolet√≠n de la Real Academia de la Historia, XXVII, Madrid 1896, p. 144). Tommaso da Capua, archbishop elect of Naples from 1215, also resigned his see after becoming cardinal in 1216 (Ganzer, p. 162 no. 69; Maleczek, p. 201‚Äì03). More obscure is the case of Rolando, bishop-elect of Dol from 1177 and cardinal-deacon of S. Maria in Portico 1185‚Äì87; certainly he never resided in his diocese and after his promotion to the cardinalate he appears in the documents only as cardinal- deacon, which indicates his resignation, but the exact dates of his death and of the appointment of his successor are not known (cf. Ganzer, p. 137 no. 58; and Gams, p. 547; according to Gams Rolando remained bishop of Dol until his death, but the date of death given by Gams - March 4, 1187, is undoubtedly erroneous because he subscribed several documents after that date, cf. Ganzer, p. 137 no. 58 note 12) Further development occurred in the pontificate of Clement III (1187‚Äì1191). Cardinals elected to the external sees renounced their titular churches but without resigning their membership in the College of Cardinals. They used the title cardinalis Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae in addition to the episcopal title, without indicating their cardinalitial order or titular church.Ganzer, p. 199‚Äì200 The first such case was that of Adelardo Cattaneo, cardinal-priest of S. Marcello from 1185 and bishop of Verona 1188‚Äì1214.Ganzer, p. 137‚Äì140 no. 59 and p. 199 That he resigned the church of San Marcello appears not only from his titulature in the documents, but also from the fact that during his lifetime a new cardinal-priest of this title (Fidanzio) was appointed.Ganzer, p. 138; on Fidanzio see Maleczek, p. 113‚Äì114 The case of Adelardo was followed by the cardinal-archbishops Guy Par√© of Reims (1204), Uberto Pirovano of Milan (1207) and Stephen Langton of Canterbury (1207) under Pope Innocent III.Ganzer, p. 149‚Äì159 and 199; Maleczek, p. 133‚Äì134, 153‚Äì154, 164‚Äì166. At the end of 12th century ca. 15% of the members of the College of Cardinals were \\"external\\" cardinals.Maleczek, p. 241 = End of the medieval \\"external\\" cardinalate = Despite the cases mentioned above, the pontificate of Innocent III marks also the beginning of the end of the \\"external\\" cardinalate. Stephen Langton was the last cardinal allowed by the Pope to become a diocesan bishop of the external see. From that time the popes constantly rejected all such postulations made by the cathedral chapters, indicating that the presence of the cardinals in the papal curia is indispensable.Paravicini Bagliani, p. 1; Ganzer, p. 202; see also several examples of the rejected episcopal elections of the cardinals in Ganzer, p. 162, 165 and 167. On the other hand, bishops appointed to the College of Cardinals were obliged to resign their sees (although it must be remarked that until the end of the 13th century they were appointed always to the rank of cardinal-bishop).Paravicini Bagliani, p. 537; Ganzer, p. 202. The first such instance occurred already in 1166, when bishop Ugo Pierleoni of Piacenza was transferred to the suburbicarian see of Tusculum by the Pope Alexander III (Ganzer, p. 114 no. 44; Brixius, p. 62 no. 9). However, it seems that it was the only such case in the 12th century. The next occurred only in the 13th century, and from the pontificate of Innocent IV (1243‚Äì1254) they became frequent (cf. Eubel, p. 3‚Äì13; Paravicini Bagliani, p. 385‚Äì388) It is still possible to find a few cases of the cardinals who exercised the posts of administrators of the episcopal sees, but only for a short time, often as part of their legatine duties. The last instance of external cardinal sensu stricto was abbot Riccardo of Montecassino (1252‚Äì1259/62). Generally already in the pontificate of Gregory IX (1227‚Äì1241), the College of Cardinals became an exclusively curial body, without any \\"external\\" element,Paravicini Bagliani, p. 1 and remained such until the Great Western Schism (1378‚Äì1417). However, during this time the rank of cardinal became also the highest in the Catholic Church, inferior only to the Pope. The phenomenon of the \\"external\\" cardinalate was revived during the Great Western Schism, but in another form and for other reasons. Popes from the rival obediences gave the cardinalitial dignities to the churchmen serving European monarchs (Crown-cardinals) without calling them to the Roman Curia, in order to assure the support of the monarchs. These cardinals continued to reside in their countries. Additionally, the curial cardinals in 13th century started to cumulate a great number of the benefices,Cumulation of the benefices by the cardinals initially included only the posts in the cathedral chapters or of the commendatory abbots (cf. Paravicini Bagliani, p. 360) from the time of the Schism including also the episcopal sees.About the transformation of the Sacred College during the Western Schism and the subsequent period see F. Bourkle-Young Papal elections in the Fifteenth Century After the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), the cardinals occupying external bishoprics were generally obliged to reside in them.See Article on the Council of Trent from the Catholic Encyclopedia Today, the majority of the cardinals are simultaneously diocesan archbishops or bishops,See S. Miranda Current membership of the College of Cardinals and they have no real jurisdiction over their titular churches at Rome.Cardinal-priests and deacons finally lost the jurisditcion over tituli and deaconries when Pope Innocent XII issued the constitution Romanum decet pontificum in 1692. Cardinal-bishops retained it much longer over the suburbicarian sees, but after 1965 they are also only titular bishops (Salvador Miranda: Guide to the events and documents. 20th century; retrieved on September 1, 2009).  Titulature and engagement in the papal government  Pope Alexander III (pictured highest at right) was the first pope who allowed the cardinals to occupy the external episcopal sees. There was no consistency to the titulature used by the \\"external\\" cardinals in the official documents issued by the popes, secular rulers or by themselves. Cardinal-abbots subscribed or were called sometimes only as cardinals, sometimes only as abbots, and sometimes using both titles. Abbot Mainardo of Pomposa subscribed papal bulls only as cardinal-bishop of Silva Candida. Desiderius of Montecassino subscribed papal bulls as abbot and cardinal or only as cardinal, while the papal privileges for the abbey Montecassino call him either cardinal and abbot or only abbot. Abbot Richard of St.-Victor used the forms ‚Äúcardinal and abbot‚Äù or only abbot. Leonato of S. Clemente in Casauria in the private documents subscribed as cardinal and abbot but the papal privileges issued for him call him only abbot without indicating his cardinalate.Ganzer, p. 183‚Äì184 Cardinals who simultaneously were also bishops usually appear in the documents with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal. The only exceptions are archbishop Uberto Crivelli of Milan, who subscribed papal bulls only as cardinal, and Ruggiero of Benevento, who generally was styled only as archbishop, while his cardinalate was mentioned very infrequently.Ganzer, p. 131 and 198. Also Anselmo of Naples appears in the documents only as archbishop, but it is not certain whether his promotion actually went into effect (Maleczek, p. 125) Even more differentiated was the engagement of the \\"external\\" cardinals in the Church government and the papal policy, even if limited evidence does not fully highlight this question. Certainly some of them spent some time working in the papal curia, which is attested by their subscriptions on the papal bulls. Among the signatories of the papal privileges appear abbots Desiderius of Montecassino, Mainardo of Pomposa, Giovanni of Subiaco, Richard of St.-Victor, Oderisio de Marsi of Montecassino, Bernardo degli Uberti of Vallombrosa, Amico of S. Vincenzo, Adenulf of Farfa, Benedetto of Torre Maggiore and Giovanni of S. Sophia,Ganzer, p. 182 as well as the bishops Hugo Candidus, Konrad von Wittelsbach, Guillaume of Reims, Uberto Crivelli of Milan, Giovanni of Toscanella and Ruffino of Rimini.Ganzer, p. 38, 106‚Äì113, 119, 126‚Äì129, 134‚Äì135, 145‚Äì147 The last three seem to have been de facto curial cardinals, having spent at the papal court most of their time.Ganzer, p. 196‚Äì197; cf. Maleczek, p. 67. On the other hand, cardinals like Pietro of S. Benedetto in Salerno, Rainaldo of Montecassino, Simone of Subiaco, Leonato of S. Clemente in Casauria, Ruggiero of Benevento, Roffredo of Montecassino or Riccardo of Montecassino seem to have never participated in the curial business.Ganzer, p. 129‚Äì131 and 182 Also cardinals Adelardo Cattaneo of Verona, Guy Par√© of Reims, Uberto Pirovano of Milan and Stephen Langton of Canterbury after their episcopal appointments are no longer attested in the papal curia.Ganzer, p. 200. Stephan Langton visited Rome in 1215‚Äì16 and 1220 but took no part in the consistories (Ganzer, p. 157‚Äì158 and 200). Several \\"external\\" cardinals acted as papal legates or vicars, often in the region of their episcopal seat or abbey. Among them were:Ganzer, p. 181, 196-198, 207. The list is not complete. * Peter Igneus of S. Salvatore ‚Äì legate in Germany (1079) and France (1080), * Mainardo of Pomposa ‚Äì legate before Emperor Henry IV (1065) and in Milan (1067) * Richard of St.-Victor ‚Äì legate in Spain for many years * Konrad von Wittelsbach ‚Äì legate in Germany from 1177 * Guillaume of Reims ‚Äì legate in France from 1179 * Ruffino of Rimini ‚Äì legate in Imola (ca.1191) * Gerardo de Sessio ‚Äì legate in Lombardy (1210‚Äì11) Besides, some \\"external\\" cardinals participated in the papal elections: Desiderius of Montecassino and Richard of St.-Victor in 1086,Ganzer, p. 183 Oderisio de Marsi in 1088,Klewitz, p. 88; H√ºls, p. 51 and 252; Robinson, p. 62; Ganzer, p. 34, 43 and 183 Enrico of Mazara and Amico of S.

Giovanni of Toscanella in 1191 and 1198,The examination of his subscriptions on the papal bulls indicates his presence in the papal curia in the spring of 1191 and at the beginning of 1198, which makes his participation in these elections very likely (cf. Maleczek, p. 364, 376‚Äì377) and Ruffino of Rimini in 1191.The examination of his subscriptions on the papal bulls indicates his presence in the papal curia in the spring of 1191, which makes his participation in this election very likely (cf. Ganzer, p. 147) Three \\"external\\" cardinals became popes: Frederick of Montecassino became Pope Stephen IX in 1057, Desiderius of Montecassino became Pope Victor III in 1086 and Uberto Crivelli of Milan became Pope Urban III in 1185.

A Zemstvo stamp was a Russian local stamp used widely in rural areas from 1865. It was named after the Zemstvo local administrative districts or uyezds that were created in 1864. The stamps ceased at about the time of the 1917 Russian revolution.  Background  The Russian post in the nineteenth century was a monopoly of the state through the Imperial Post. Most state post offices, however, were in towns, leaving many rural areas a long distance from the nearest post office. The (or Rural post) was introduced in 1864 to fill this gap and at first it operated without official approval.Edwards, Fred W. Rural Stamps of the Russian Empire in Stamp Collectors' Fortnightly, September 1910. In 1870 a law was passed formalising the arrangements and which stated that \\"The Rural post is authorised to carry ordinary correspondence, also journals, circulars, remittances, registered letters, and other mail from the post town, to all more or less distant portions of the district as may be deprived of postal communications.\\"Quoted in \\"Russian unorthodoxy\\" by Charles & Francis Kiddle, Stamp Magazine, January 2008, pp. 80-81. The law also stated that \\"The Rural post is authorised to employ special postage stamps on the express understanding that their design differs entirely from those used by the Imperial Post\\". The postmen were also not allowed to use the post-horn emblem of the Imperial Post on their bags.Chuchin, F.G. Russia Zemstvos. Revised edition. Ed. J. Barefoot. York, England: J. Barefoot Ltd., 1988, p.6. The first Zemstvo post was established at Vetluga in 1864 but no stamps were used.  Stamps  According to Chuchin's catalogue, at least 3000 different Zemstvo stamps were issued, however, records are incomplete and it is likely that there are many still to be discovered. The first Zemstvo stamp was issued by Schlisselburg in September 1865. According to , in 1864 there were 36 Zemstvo governments with 371 districts and stamps were used in 162 districts. By 1892 there was a Zemstvo post in 150 districts but not all issued stamps and in some the post was free.  Collecting  A Zemstvo stamp issued in Kungar province. Unused Zemstvo stamps were highly appreciated among the early collectors. For example, stamps of the most recent issues were 3 to 5 times more expensive than their real price. Rates of stamps of older issues increased in geometrical progression. For some stamps of the first issues, prices were inflated by dealers up to 400 rubles and more. High value of unused Zemstvo stamps was due to the fact that they had not been collected by philatelists in the 1860s. As for used stamps, they were valued much cheaper, yet stamps of the first issues being expensive, too. Zemstvo stamps were in great demand among foreign philatelists. Zemstvo stamps were officially sanctioned local stamps. As such they appear only in specialised books and catalogues. Several books about Zemstvo stamps were published in the French and German languages. The book Description of the Russian Zemstvo Stamps, Envelopes and Parcels by D. Chudovsky was issued in Kiev in 1888 and was also very popular. A number of catalogues were produced in Germany and Russia before the revolution but some are incomplete and other were published before the cessation of the service and therefore do not give a full history of the stamps. The principal catalogue in English is the Chuchin catalogue of 1925 as updated by Barefoot. Chuchin numbers are widely used to identify Zemstvos. Recently, as collecting Zemstvos has become more popular, new catalogues have started to appear in the Russian language.

She was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1942, and is the sister-in-law of MIT professor Noam Chomsky. She became involved with politics when she participated in demonstrations in the 1950s for the right of African-Americans to use non- segregated lunch counters. Early life Chomsky was a graduate student in anthropology when she joined a project to organize grassroots opposition to the Vietnam War. She left graduate school and spent the next several years as an organizer with the Philadelphia Resistance, primarily with anti war GIs (active duty in the military) and with Vietnam veterans. As the US participation in the war wound down, Chomsky decided that her family circumstances as a mother of two did not permit her to work as an organizer. She decided to go to law school so that she could participate in the same struggles with new skills better suited to her personal life. Career In 1975, with three law school friends, following her graduation from Temple Law School, she became a co-founder of the Juvenile Law Center of Philadelphia. After a few years, she had the opportunity to represent migrant farm laborers and to begin the Workers Rights Law Project to serve workers who were trying to organize within their labor organization to create more democratic and active unions. She was contacted by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which was looking for a lawyer who could go to Gaza and the Occupied West Bank to help prepare a case involving civilian deaths from the Israeli occupation. This began her current work life as a cooperating attorney with the CCR, where she works on cases in their international human rights docket. On July 19, 2008, Chomsky filed a status report on Civil Action No. 05-CV-1645 on behalf of Hussein Salem Mohammed. According to Chomsky a petition for habeas corpus was filed on August 16, 2005.

In comparison to the DC-3 design, with the straight wings to the right of SERV, SERV would be just over 100 feet long, while DC-3 was just under 300. SERV, short for Single-stage Earth-orbital Reusable Vehicle, was a proposed space launch system designed by Chrysler's Space Division for the Space Shuttle project. SERV was so radically different from the two-stage spaceplanes that almost every other competitor entered into the Shuttle development process that it was never seriously considered for the shuttle program. SERV was to be a single-stage to orbit spacecraft that would take off from the existing Saturn V complexes and land vertically at Kennedy for re-use. SERV looked like a greatly expanded Apollo capsule, with an empty central core able to carry of cargo. SERV could be launched uncrewed for cargo missions, ejecting a cargo capsule and returning to Earth. For crewed missions, a separate spaceplane, MURP (Manned Upper-stage Reusable Payload), could be carried atop the vehicle. The name \\"SERV\\" was also used by an entirely unrelated NASA project, the \\"Space Emergency Re-entry Vehicle\\". History =Background= In 1966 the US Air Force started a study effort that explored a variety of crewed spacecraft and associated launchers. As the proposals were studied, they broke them down into one of three classes, based on the level of reusability. On the simpler end of the development scale were the \\"Class I\\" vehicles that placed a spaceplane on top of an existing or modified ICBM-based launcher. \\"Class II\\" vehicles added partial reusability for some of the launcher components, while the \\"Class III\\" vehicles were fully reusable. The USAF had already started work on a Class I design in their X-20 Dyna Soar program, which had been cancelled in December 1963, but were interested in the Lockheed Star Clipper Class II design as a possible future development. Nothing ever came of the study effort, as the USAF wound down their interest in crewed space programs. At the time, NASA was in the midst of winding down the Project Apollo build-out, as the vehicles progressed to flight. Looking into the future, a number of NASA offices started programs to explore crewed missions in the 1970s and beyond. Among the many proposals, a permanently crewed space station was a favorite. These plans generally assumed the use of the existing Saturn rockets to launch the stations, and even the crews, but the Saturn systems were not set up for the sort of constant supply and crew turnaround being envisioned. The idea of a simple and inexpensive crewed launcher, a \\"ferry and logistics vehicle\\", developed out of the space station studies almost as an afterthought, the first mention of it being in the fiscal year 1967 budgets.Helen Wells, Susan Whiteley, and Carrie Karegeannes, \\"Origins of NASA Names\\", NASA SP-4402, 1976 Design of a low cost, reusable Space Transportation System (STS) started in earnest in December 1967, when George Mueller organized a one-day brainstorming session on the topic. He jump-started the discussion by inviting the USAF to attend, even keeping the original USAF acronym for the project, \\"ILRV\\". Like the original USAF studies, a small vehicle was envisioned, carrying replacement crews and basic supplies, with an emphasis on low cost of operations and fast turnarounds. Unlike the USAF, however, NASA's Space Task Force quickly decided to move directly to the Class III designs. =Phase A= NASA envisioned a four-phase program of development for the STS. \\"Phase A\\" was a series of initial studies to select an overall technology path, and development contracts for proposals were released in 1968 with the proposals expected back in the fall of 1969. A number of designs were presented from a variety of industry partners. Almost universally, the designs were small, fully reusable, and based around delta wing or lifting body spaceplanes. Chrysler Aerospace won contract NAS8-26341 for their entry into the Phase A series, forming a team under Charles Tharratt. Their 1969 report, NASA-CR-148948, outlined the SERV design, preliminary performance measures, and basic mission profiles. This report described a wide cargo bay Tharratt was convinced that SERV offered better flexibility than any of the winged platforms, allowing it to launch both crewed and uncrewed missions, and being much smaller overall.NASA- CR-148948, pg. 9 With most of the NASA centers backing one of the winged vehicles, and being dramatically different from any of them, SERV found no supporters within the bureaucracy and was never seriously considered for STS.Andrew Butrica, \\"Single Stage to Orbit\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, , pg. 84 Additionally, the astronaut corps was adamant that any future NASA spacecraft would have to be crewed,Gregg Easterbrook, \\"Beam Us Out Of This Death Trap, Scotty\\" , Washington Monthly, April 1980 so the potentially uncrewed SERV won no converts there either. An extension contract was offered anyway, producing the final NASA-CR-150241 report on the SERV design that was turned in on 1 July 1971. This differed mostly in minor details, the major change being the reduction of the cargo bay from 23 feet to in keeping with the rest of the Shuttle proposals. Description =Vehicle design= SERV consisted of a large conical body with a rounded base that Chrysler referred to as a \\"modified Apollo design\\". The resemblance is due to the fact that both vehicles used blunt body re-entry profiles, which lessen heating load during re-entry by creating a very large shock wave in front of a rounded surface. Tilting the vehicle in relation to the direction of motion changes the pattern of the shock waves, producing lift that can be used to maneuver the spacecraft - in the case of SERV, up to about 100 NM on either side of its ballistic path.CR-150241, slide 3-33 To aid lift generation, SERV was \\"stepped\\", with the lower portion of the cone angled in at about 30 degrees, and the upper portion closer to 45 degrees. SERV was across at the widest point, and tall.CR-150241, slide 2-3 Gross lift off weight was just over ,CR-150241, slide 2-9 about the same as the Saturn V's but more than the Shuttle's . The majority of the SERV airframe consisted of steel composite honeycomb. The base was covered with screw-on ablative heat shield panels, which allowed for easy replacement between missions. The upper portions of the airframe, which received dramatically lower heating loads, were covered with metal shingles covering a quartz insulation below.NASA-CR-148948, pg. 111 Four landing legs extended from the bottom, their \\"foot\\" forming their portion of heat shield surface when retracted.NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35 A twelve module LH2/LOX aerospike engine was arranged around the rim of the base, covered by movable metal shields.CR-150241, slide 4-3 During the ascent the shields would move out from the body to adjust for decreasing air pressure, forming a large altitude compensating nozzle. The module was fed from a set of four cross- linked turbopumps that were designed to run at up to 120% of their nominal power, allowing orbital insertion even if one pump failed immediately after takeoff. The engine as a whole would provide 7,454,000 lbf (25.8 MN) of thrust, about the same as the S-IC, the first stage of the Saturn V. Also arranged around the base were forty jet engines, which were fired just prior to touchdown in order to slow the descent. Movable doors above the engines opened for feed air.See general layout diagram, CR-150241, slide 2-13 Two RL-10's provided de-orbit thrust, so the main engine did not have to be restarted in space. Even on-orbit maneuvering, which was not extensive for the SERV (see below), was provided by small LOX/LH2 engines instead of thrusters using different fuels.NASA-CR-148948, pg. 117 A series of conical tanks around the outside rim of the craft, just above the engines, stored the LOX. LH2 was stored in much larger tanks closer to the center of the craft. Much smaller spherical tanks, located in the gaps below the rounded end of the LOX tanks, held the JP-4 used to feed the jet engines. Orbital maneuvering and de-orbit engines were clustered around the top of the spacecraft, fed by their own tanks interspersed between the LH2. This arrangement of tanks left a large open space in the middle of the craft, 15 by , which served as the cargo hold. =Operational modes= Two basic spacecraft configurations and mission profiles were envisioned. \\"Mode A\\" missions flew SERV to a high-altitude parking orbit at inclined at 55 degrees, just below the space station's orbit at . \\"Mode B\\" missions flew to a low Earth orbit (LEO) inclined at 28.5 degrees, a due-east launch from the Kennedy Space Center. In either case the SERV was paired with a long cargo container in its bay, and optionally combined with a crewed spacecraft on top. The original proposals used a lifting body spaceplane known as MURP to support crewed missions. The MURP was based on the HL-10 design already under study by North American Rockwell as part of their STS efforts. MURP was fitted on top of a cargo container and fairing, which was long overall.CR-150241, slide 2-5 In the second version of the study, Chrysler also added an option that replaced MURP with a \\"personnel module\\", based on the Apollo CSM, which was long when combined with the same cargo container. The original, \\"SERV-MURP\\", was when combined with SERV, while the new configuration, \\"SERV-PM\\", was tall. Both systems included an all- aspect abort of the crewed portion throughout the entire ascent.CR-150241, slide 3-17 After considering all four combinations of mode and module, two basic mission profiles were selected as the most efficient. With SERV-PM the high-earth orbit would be used and the PM would maneuver only a short distance to reach the station. With SERV-MURP, the low Earth orbit would be used and the MURP would maneuver the rest of the way on its own. In either case, the SERV could return to Earth immediately and let the PM or MURP land on their own, or more commonly, wait in the parking orbit for a cargo module from an earlier mission to rendezvous with it for return to Earth.CR-150241, slide 2-7 Weight and balance considerations limited the return payload. Both configurations delivered of cargo to the space station, although in the PM configuration the overall thrown weights were much lower. If the PM configuration was used with a fairing instead of the capsule, SERV could deliver to LEO, or as much as with an \\"Extended Nosecone\\".CR-150241, slide 3-19 The Extended Nosecone was a long spike with a high fineness ratio that lowered atmospheric drag by creating shock waves that cleared the vehicle body during ascent. In addition, Chrysler also outlined ways to support wide loads on the front of SERV. This was the diameter of the S-IC and S-II, the lower stages of the Saturn V. NASA had proposed a wide variety of payloads for the Apollo Applications Program that were based on this diameter that were intended to be launched on the Saturn INT-21. Chrysler demonstrated that they could also be launched on SERV, if weight considerations taken into account. However, these plans were based on the earlier SERV designs with the larger cargo bay. When NASA's loads were adapted to fit to the smaller bay common to all the STS proposals, this option was dropped. SERV was not expected to remain on orbit for extended periods of time, with the longest missions outlined in the report at just under 48 hours.CR-150241, slide 3-5 Typically it would return after a small number of orbits brought its ground track close enough to Kennedy, and abort-once-around missions were contemplated. The vehicle was designed to return to a location within four miles (6 km) of the touchdown point using re-entry maneuvering, the rest would be made up during the jet-powered descent.NASA-CR-148948, pg. 119 =Construction and operations= NASA had partnered with Chrysler to build the NASA-designed Saturn IB, at the Michoud Assembly Facility outside New Orleans. Chrysler proposed building SERVs at Michoud as well, delivering them to KSC on the Bay- class ships used to deliver Boeing's S-IC from the same factory. Since the SERV was wider than the ships, it had to be carried slightly tilted in order to reduce its overall width. Pontoons were then added to the side of the ships to protect the spacecraft from spray.CR-150241, slide 9-11 SERVs would be fitted out in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) High Bay, mated with the PM or MURP which were prepared in the Low Bay, and then transported to the LC39 pads on the existing crawler-transporters.CR-150241, slide 9-15 The LC39 pads required only minor modifications for SERV use, similar to those needed to launch the Saturn IB.CR-150241, slide 9-21 Chrysler proposed building several SERV landing pads between LC39 and the VAB, and a landing strip for the MURP near the existing Space Shuttle landing strip.NASA-CR-148948, pg. 145 The SERVs would be returned to the VAB on an enormous flatbed truck. The only other new infrastructure was a set of test stands at the Mississippi Test Operations engine testing complex, near Michoud. Re-using much of the existing infrastructure lowered overall program costs; total costs were estimated as $3.565 billion, with each SERV costing $350 million in FY1971 dollars, and being rated for 100 flights over a 10-year service life.CR-150241, pg. 5 This was far less expensive than the two-stage flyback proposals entered by most companies, which had peak development costs on the order of $10 billion. Similar designs SERV was similar to the later McDonnell Douglas DC-X design. The primary difference between the two was that the DC-X was built to a military mission and required much greater re-entry maneuvering capability. Because of this, the airframe was long and skinny, and the spacecraft re- entered nose-first. Tilting this shape relative to the path of motion generates considerably more lift than the blunt base of SERV, but also subjects the airframe to much higher heating loads. More recently, the original SERV layout was used in the Blue Origin Goddard spacecraft. Like the SERV, Goddard did not need the extended crossrange capabilities of a military launcher, and returned to the simpler blunt-base re-entry profile. The similar Kankoh-maru design study also used the same blunt-body VTOL profile.

Since 2014, the program offers online courses to many writers and poets across the world.Distance Learning University of Iowa website, June 2015 Since its inception in 1967, the IWP has hosted over 1,500 emerging and established poets, novelists, dramatists, essayists, and journalists from more than 150 countries. Its primary goal is to introduce talented writers to the writing community at the University of Iowa, and to provide for the writers a period of optimal conditions for their creative work. Since 2000, the IWP has been directed by poet and journalist Christopher Merrill.  History  The IWP was founded by Paul Engle and Hualing Nieh Engle as a non-academic, internationally focused counterpart to the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Under the Engles' guidance, hundreds of writers came to Iowa, particularly from parts of the world where literary and personal freedom was often restricted. During the 1970s and 1980s the program's reach towards nations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and eastern Europe expanded significantly. In 1979 the Engles coordinated a \\"Chinese Weekend\\", one of the first significant meetings of writers from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora since 1949.\\"Publishing: Chinese Weekend in Iowa.\\" Mitgang, Herbert. New York Times; Aug. 17, 1979 For their efforts to connect writers worldwide and to promote international understanding, the Engles were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976. Hualing Nieh Engle and Paul Engle co-directed the IWP until 1977, after which Engle retired and Hualing continued as sole director. She retired in 1988, and currently serves as a member of the IWP Advisory Board. Other past directors include Fredrick Woodard (1988), Clark Blaise (1990), Steven Ungar (1998), and Sandra Barkan (1999).  Current activities  The primary residency, which takes place each fall, offers writers the opportunity to participate in American literary, academic, and cultural life through talks, lectures, readings, screenings, stage performances, school visits, and travel, while providing time for personal writing and creative work. University of Iowa students can take several classes built around the work and presence of the IWP residents. Literary translation is an integral part of the program's mission. At the time of Hualing's retirement, two volumes of selected IWP writings had been compiled under the title Writing From The World, in addition to another collection, The World Comes To Iowa, and more than a dozen individual volumes in the Iowa Translation Series. Today, the IWP supports 91st Meridian, an online literary journal, and the book series 91stM Books, housed at the independent Autumn Hill Books. In recent years the program has broadened its efforts to promote international connections among writers by organizing a variety of events, some of which take place outside the United States. Among these are: *Reading tours of American authors in the Middle East and other regions. *International colloquia on current cultural topics *Life of Discovery, a multi-year artist exchange program with members of Chinese minority groups *Between the Lines, a program bringing high school students from Arabic-speaking countries and RUssia to Iowa to practice creative writing alongside American students = Funding = A major source of funding for writers attending the IWP is the U.S. Department of State, and the program's administration is supported by the University of Iowa. The IWP also administers grants for writers sponsored for their residency by private and public cultural organizations in the United States and abroad.  The IWP in literature and film  The IWP itself has been featured in a number of literary works, including: *Memories of Light and Shade‚ÄîPart 1, a serial novel by Sunil Gangopadhyay, published in the Bengali journal Urhalpool *The Fall of the Japanese Language in the Age of English, a novel by Minae Mizumura *\\"Writing in the Mirror of the River\\", a short story by Mohamed Magani, published in 91st Meridian In 1973, the United States Information Agency funded a documentary about the IWP, Community of the Imagination.

Together with The Kilmog, a hill north of Waitati, this is one of the two most notable hill sections of State Highway 1 south of Christchurch. 'Motorway' status and access Dunedin‚ÄìWaitati Highway was officially designated a motorway when it opened on 14 December 1957 Otago Daily Times dated 16 December 1957 and is still colloquially referred to as such. \\"Motorway\\" signage was removed and the road lacks any indication of its former status other than \\"No Cycling/No Pedestrians\\" signs at Pine Hill and Waitati Valley. Apart from occasional overpasses, it does not resemble a freeway or motorway, rather a two-to-four-lane undivided limited-access road, although cyclists and pedestrians are allowed on the northern section. Dunedin-Waitati Highway is a highway in terms of traffic regulations, while the land corridor is designated motorway under the New Zealand Government Roading Powers Act and town planning rules.When is a motorway not a motorway? on blueskin.co.nz news website, retrieved 2011-02-07 and archived on Internet Archive There are occasional private property accesses along the 15 km length and two at-grade intersections: one at the Leith Saddle summit, with Leith Valley Road and Waitati Valley Road, the other at the lower end of Waitati Valley Road. Intersecting roads all have low traffic volumes and are unsealed. All other road crossings are grade separated on bridges with no road connections, at Maxwellton Street (which links the suburb of Glenleith with both Pine Hill and the summit of Mount Cargill), Leith Valley Road, Dryden Road, and Pigeon Flat Road; the last of these is the only bridge north of the saddle. Improvements Several parts of the highway were realigned or widened around 2000, most notably between the Pigeon Flat Overbridge and the start of the Waitati River floodplain. =Leith Saddle= conservation values. Transit New Zealand signalled in 2004 its long term intention was to re-align SH1 in the vicinity of Leith Saddle, which would require some removal of old-growth forest The forest here features a species of Libocedrus, variously called Pahautea, Kaikawaka or New Zealand cedar, Libocedrus bidwillii, which is unusual in this region of New Zealand.Wildlife Feature on Orokonui Ecosanctuary website, retrieved 2009-06-10 Transit New Zealand stated in 2004 that Leith Saddle has 250% more crashes than average for the New Zealand state highway network and that the accident rate increased by 50% in the ten years to 2004.Transit New Zealand leaflet Leith Saddle Realignment, 2004 They said realignment here would reduce traffic delays, fuel use, crashes, and emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. =Waitati= The motorway originally ended at Waitati with a roundabout, which featured in the New Zealand film Goodbye Pork Pie. The roundabout has been removed, leaving a sharp curve with a T junction. In 2010, the NZ Transport Agency (the successor highway authority to Transit New Zealand) was given consent to realign the road here.

History In 1993, The Oregon Citizens Alliance attempted to influence Washington politics by gathering signatures for a ballot initiative that would have restricted the civil rights of GLBT citizens in Washington State. The Citizens for Fairness/Hands Off Washington campaign was a grassroots gay rights effort that repelled this attempt, casting the OCA as an Oregonian organization trying to manipulate Washington State politics. During its brief history, the HOW campaign repelled a number of OCA attempts. In 1997, Washington's existing discrimination laws protected against many different classes, but not sexual orientation, perceived or actual; the HOW campaign attempted to add both categories to the existing anti-discrimination laws via a ballot measure (Initiative 677), which failed to pass despite high profile support from Governor Gary Locke. However, this pro-LGBT rights initiative I-677 was the first-ever attempt to win statewide legal rights at the ballot box, a controversial strategy never before attempted. Until this ballot measure, conventional LGBT rights strategies focused on court precedents and legislative sponsored bills. In spite of this loss, HOW was significant in its track record of defeating every anti-LGBT measure brought forward and expanding strategies for LGBT rights. Hands Off Washington lost momentum after this setback, and faded gradually over the following years. Legacy Hands Off Washington was founded as the first-ever statewide LGBT rights organization, with active chapters in 22 counties, including many in conservative Eastern Washington. This unprecedented strategy allowed HOW to tap local community activists in every corner of the State, in rural and suburban areas as well as urban ones. Until HOW, LGBT rights were headquartered and active only in large liberal cities, often overlooking small towns and rural LGBT people. HOW was the forerunner of many Washingtonian LGBT civil rights organizations, including Equal Rights Washington, and Washington Families Standing Together. It was formed as an ad hoc grassroots effort consisting almost entirely of volunteers operating on a minimal budget, and achieved remarkable success given its lack of formal structure or funds. While other GLBT service groups predate the Washington Citizens for Fairness/Hands Off Washington campaign, they were mostly non- political in nature, and therefore the HOW can be seen as one of the first significant, statewide efforts at political involvement by GLBT people in Washington State. A documentary, We're Here to Stay: a Documentary About Hands Off Washington and the Politics of Washington State, was released in 1998 to chronicle the organization's rapid rise and equally rapid decline. While the group has largely been forgotten, it appears quite frequently in news articles published during the period in which it was active, from about 1993 to the end of 1997. HOW established the potential for LGBT political organizations to garner support far from the heavily urbanized parts of Western Washington, where prior misconceptions alleged the only real support base could exist. This laid the groundwork for the organizations that followed it, and many of the leaders of those organizations got their start in the HOW campaign.

Only about 120 players regularly compete on the national PBA Tour. Through the 2008‚Äì09 season, Regional PBA professionals could qualify for the national tour by topping one of the seven regions in points. For the 2009‚Äì10 season, Regional qualification was revised, as bowlers had to qualify via the Regional Players Invitational (RPI) tournament. The top 25 bowlers on the RPI points list in each of the seven PBA regions (through September, 2008) earned an invitation to the 2008 RPI. The top five from each region ‚Äì plus the winner of the 2008 Regional Players Championship (won by Sean Swanson in late May that year) ‚Äì received airfare and accommodations for the event in December, 2008 and did not have to pay an additional fee to be eligible for a PBA Tour exemption. The next 20 players in each region were required to pay their own way to the RPI, and also had to pay an additional $750 on top of the entry fee to be eligible for a Tour exemption. The 2008 RPI featured a similar format to the PBA Tour Trials, in that competitors bowled for five days on each of the PBA's five \\"animal\\" oil patterns. The top eight bowlers who (if necessary) paid the additional entry fee earned exemptions for the 2009‚Äì10 season, provided they finished in the top 16 overall.

Life Born in Scotland, he made his name as proprietor and editor of the South Durham Mercury in Hartlepool, which was at the time, County Durham's only morning newspaper. In 1870, at the request of the powerful Pease family in Darlington, he founded The Northern Echo, ostensibly to counter the rhetoric of rival papers, the Darlington & Stockton Times and the Darlington Mercury. A stalwart Liberal and Gladstonian, and a formidable journalist in his own right, he gained prominence within the Liberal Party through his tireless efforts for the causes of industrial arbitration and education, and was an early advocate of Irish Home Rule. Arguably, Bell's greatest contribution to journalism lay in his discovery of W. T. Stead, whom he installed as editor of The Northern Echo in 1871 at the age of just 22. When Stead left to join the Pall Mall Gazette in 1880, Bell's search for a suitable replacement was only partially successful and, perhaps frustrated by this, or troubled by discontent within the Liberal Party itself, he severed ties with the Echo in 1889.

The 2004 North West 200 was a nightmare for Hutchinson, as within yards of starting his first practice lap of the circuit, he injured his leg and put himself out of the meeting. Hutchinson made his Isle of Man TT debut in 2004, competing in four races all on board a Suzuki. Despite recording the eighth fastest lap in the final Junior TT practice session, Hutchinson would only take one top ten finish in the Formula One TT, edging out Manx rider Gary Carswell by 2.3 seconds after 150 miles racing. He also competed in selected races of the British Superstock Championship. He returned to the Isle of Man in , but this time campaigned Hondas throughout the races. After making the top five in Superstock practice, Hutchinson ended the week with three top tens and an eleventh-place finish. He also made his debut at the Ulster Grand Prix in 2005 and continued with selected British Superstock races. =2006: McAdoo Kawasaki= After Ryan Farquhar moved from McAdoo Racing to TAS Suzuki, Hutchinson was signed up by McAdoo to ride their Kawasaki in 2006. The partnership had immediate success, with Hutchinson winning the 600cc Supersport Race at the North West 200, edging out Rob Frost and Bruce Anstey with the top three split by just under two seconds. He also recorded the fastest Supersport lap in the history of the event, recording a lap of 116.881 mph. He then enjoyed his best ever TT meeting, with two seconds and a third, although one of the runner-up positions was stripped from him, due to his Kawasaki ZX-6 being deemed to be illegal due to a 0.2mm (0.02 cm) difference in cam dimensions. He repeated this performance at the Ulster Grand Prix, losing out to Guy Martin in both Supersport races. He also continued in Superstock, with a best finish of second twice at Oulton Park. He pulled out of the championship after his second Oulton second, and would finish sixth overall having been second after Oulton with 100 points. He moved up into the British Supersport Championship replacing the injured Pere Riba on the MSS Discovery Kawasaki in the final four rounds. He finished fifteenth in the championship, on 42 points. =2007: HM Plant Honda= Hutchinson moved to HM Plant Honda for the 2007 road racing season, and achieved four podiums at the 2007 Isle of Man TT including his first TT win during the Supersport Junior TT, beating John McGuinness by just 2.84 seconds. He also took his first win at the Ulster Grand Prix, with a win in the Superbike race. He also competed in the British Supersport Championship, finishing eighth overall including a win at Oulton Park for Bike Animal Honda. =2008: AIM Yamaha= Hutchinson moved to his third different team in three years, signing with Alastair Flanagan's AIM Racing for the 2008 season. Things did not go as planned, and with him lying tenth in the British Supersport Championship, Hutchinson and AIM parted company. He did record two more podiums at the 2008 Isle of Man TT. =2009: Padgett's HRC Honda= After an extended off-season, Hutchinson signed for Padgett's Honda for the 2009 season. Hutchinson suffered a disappointing 2009 North West 200 Races, with two sixth places being his best results. However, the 2009 Isle of Man TT has been a different story, with Hutchinson claiming two of the three solo races so far. After a fourth in the rain-delayed opening race on Monday, Hutchinson won both the first race of the Supersport Junior TT and the TT Superstock, setting a lap record in the latter. The Senior TT brought disappointment to Hutchinson, who was heading for a podium finish until sliding off his bike due to oil on the track at Quarterbridge. The crash meant that he lost the chance to win the ¬£10,000 prize money for the most successful rider of the week, which was won by Steve Plater. Hutchinson ended up second in the championship standings with 74 points; ten points behind Plater. The TT results saw him given an opportunity by Padgetts in the British Supersport Championship, joining the series at round five. Despite missing the first four rounds, by round eight he was already up to eighth in the championship after four successive top seven finishes, the highlight being third at Mallory Park. The success continued at the Ulster Grand Prix in August where he won the Superstock race, also smashing the lap record. He also claimed second in the first Supersport race, losing out to race winner Ryan Farquhar by just 0.001 seconds. Hutchinson also finished second and third in the two Superbike races and sixth in the second Supersport race. He also lapped the Dundrod Circuit at more than during the first Superbike race, the fastest lap in the history of the Ulster Grand Prix, with only Conor Cummins recording a quicker lap, when competing at the Dundrod 150. 2010 Senior TT with starting official Paul Kermode =2010: Padgett's HRC Honda= Hutchinson started the 2010 season as part of a two-bike team for Padgetts Motorcycles in the British Supersport Championship, riding a Honda CBR600RR alongside teammate Glen Richards. Hutchinson went to the Isle of Man TT meeting in June looking to increase his win tally from three and after a decent showing at the North West 200, taking victory in the second Supersport race as well as taking two runner-up placings in the other Supersport race, and also the Superstock race finishing behind Alastair Seeley and Keith Amor respectively. Hutchinson improved his tally to six victories by taking victories in the first three solo races; the Superbike, Supersport and Superstock TTs, becoming one of the select riders to have achieved three victories in a week at the meeting. In the second Supersport race, Hutchinson equalled the 1996 record of Phillip McCallen by winning his fourth race of the week, edging out Michael Dunlop by 1.5 seconds. He broke the record after completing the clean sweep in a re-run, shortened Senior TT. Hutchinson was running fourth in the first attempt to run the race but was curtailed due to an incident involving Guy Martin. With many of his rivals retiring early on in the re-run, Hutchinson won the race by 37 seconds from Ryan Farquhar. The next major meeting for Hutchinson was the Ulster Grand Prix at Dundrod. After retiring from the Superbike race at the Dundrod 150 meeting held a few days before the main meeting, Hutchinson was lacking race mileage on his Superbike machine. This did not hinder him as he won the first Superbike race, as well as the first Supersport race and the Superstock race. Hutchinson's final road racing meeting of the season was at the Scarborough Gold Cup meeting at Oliver's Mount, where he won the prestigious Gold Cup race, breaking Guy Martin's streak of winning the race each year since 2003. He also won the David Jefferies Cup for 600cc motorcycles, winning each leg of the race. One week later, Hutchinson's 2010 season came to an abrupt halt during a British Supersport Championship race at Silverstone. On the first lap of the race held in wet conditions, several riders, including Hutchinson, fell due to the circuit conditions. Hutchinson was then struck by another rider as he lay on the track and suffered compound fractures to his tibia and fibula in his left leg. The injuries ruled him out of the remaining British championship round ‚Äì despite this, he finished tenth in the championship standings ‚Äì and also the Macau Grand Prix meeting. Hutchinson had said that he was determined to be fit for the start of the 2011 short circuit season. However, after 16 operations and skin grafts, the injury forced him to miss the start of the season, and ultimately withdrew from both the North West 200 and the Isle of Man TT. =2011: Swan Yamaha= Hutchinson signed a two-year deal with Swan Yamaha which covered the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Set to spearhead Yamaha's road racing campaign as part of their 50th anniversary in 2011, Hutchinson suffered continuous set backs through his ongoing injury. Hutchinson did attend the 2011 Isle of Man TT, during which he rode several exhibition laps of the Mountain Course to widespread acclaim. He did however make a welcome return to the track, when he competed at the Macau Grand Prix in November. Despite being one of the world's most demanding circuits, Hutchinson was on the pace and brought his Swan Yamaha home in third place and led the race for the first two-and-a-half laps. =2012: Swan Yamaha= Tower Bends in the 2012 Supersport TT Following an off-season which saw him undergo further operations as part of his recuperation, Hutchinson was injured when he twisted his leg awkwardly while riding an off-road bike in rehearsals for his appearance at the Carole Nash MCN Motorcycle show at Excel in London.http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/General- news/2012/February/feb0112-hutchinson-feared-to-have-broken-leg-again/ This led to reports stating that he would miss the start of the racing season, and importantly both the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT. He had an external fixator fitted and began yet more recuperation in a race against time to be fit to commence his racing campaign. Hutchinson was passed fit to participate at the North West 200 meeting,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/motorsport/17693987 and opened his account with a highly commendable 10th in the Supersport race one. Hutchinson followed this up with 13th place in the first of the Superbike races, and concluded the meeting with a very respectable 7th in the following Superbike race, the North West 200. Buoyed by his exploits at the North West 200, Hutchinson arrived at the TT for a welcomed return. His team boss, Shaun Muir, was eager to stress that both Hutchinson and the Swan Yamaha squad were primarily looking at the meeting as a \\"work in progress,\\" but despite the statement Hutchinson recorded some competitive times during practice week. Hutchinson made an excellent start to the week's racing by taking 8th place in the opening Superbike race, at an average speed of 123.827 mph. Hutchinson recorded a 9th-place finish in the first of the two Supersport 600cc races astride the R6 Yamaha, with a race speed of 119.283. Further solid performances followed, which saw Hutchinson secure 11th place in the Superstock race and a highly praised 6th place in the second Supersport race, with an improved average race speed of 120.549 mph Already highly popular with fans of motorcycle racing, Ian Hutchinson's participation at the 2012 TT is widely regarded as one of the most spirited and determined campaigns in the event's history. Unfortunately, the Senior TT was postponed from its traditional Friday slot to the following day due to adverse weather. Following a further appraisal of conditions, it was decided to cancel the 2012 Senior - the only time in its 105-year history when a cancellation has occurred as a consequence of the weather. =2013: Milwaukee Yamaha= After the 2012 Isle of Man TT, Hutchinson stepped down from the motorcycle and started his 18-month-long recovery from his nearly career ending injuries. On 26 September 2013 he had his 30th, and hopefully final operation on his badly injured left leg. After that, he went to Donington Park along with his friend, and fellow racer Leon Haslam and made his competitive return to motorcycling testing a Yamaha R1 Superbike for Shaun Muir's Milwaukee Yamaha team. A three-day-long shakedown test followed that at the Circuito de Almer√≠a and tested his modified Yamaha R1 for more than 200 laps. Despite planning his racing return for 2014 only, Ian and his Milwaukee Yamaha team filed an entry for the 47th Grand Prix of Macau, but the organizers of the event turned down his entry, because they missed the deadline by 24 hours. Only 4 days later, on 14 October they allowed Ian to compete in the race. A month later, Ian grabbed the pole position for the 47th Grand Prix of Macau, beating the most successful rider at the event ever, Michael Rutter by only 0.057 seconds. The sensational comeback didn't stop there as Hutchinson went on to win the Macau GP from Rutter and McGuinness completing one of the most successful comebacks racing fans have seen in recent history. =2014: Milwaukee Yamaha / PBM Kawasaki= Hutchinson started out with his old Milwaukee team but parted company, joining Paul Bird Motorsport for a few rounds of Pirelli National Superstock 1000 competition on the Rapid Solicitors Kawasaki team, after which he again competed in the Macau road GP on Shane Byrne's superbike without his previous year's success, overshooting a corner and retiring after a low-speed fall.Stuart Easton wins Macau GP MC News Retrieved 23 April 2015 =2015: PBM / Team Traction Control= He took a hat trick of victories at the 2015 Isle of Man TT, including two wins in the Monster Energy Supersport class (races 1 & 2)http://www.iomtt.com/~/media/Files/2015/Race-results/Monster-Energy- Supersport-Race-1/lap%20x%20lap%20ME%20Supersport.pdf and also a win in the RL360¬∞ Superstock Race.

This was followed up by the runner up place on the podium, behind Michael Dunlop, in the only Superbike race run at the 2016 event. Isle of Man TT Hutchinson and Dunlop arrived on the Isle of Man amongst the favourites to take the honours in the main races at the 2016 Isle of Man TT. A week's worth of fine weather during qualifying, saw Hutchinson power his TAS BMW S1000RR Superstock machine to a new lap record, beating the previous one set by John McGuinness on a Superbike the previous year.http://www.iomtt.com/News/2016/June/03/Hutchinson-blitzes-field-with- sensational-lap.aspx However, the time recorded was unofficial as it had been set in practice. The opening Superbike TT race saw Hutchinson and Dunlop at the head of the field from start to finish. Hutchinson trailed Dunlop throughout, although he did manage to record two laps inside the previous course record. Hutchinson eventually finished second to Dunlop by 19.06 seconds after 226 miles of racing.

Digital textile printing is described as any ink jet based method of printing colorants onto fabric. Most notably, digital textile printing is referred to when identifying either printing smaller designs onto garments (T-shirts, dresses, promotional wear; abbreviated as DTG, which stands for Direct to garment printing) and printing larger designs onto large format rolls of textile. The latter is a growing trend in visual communication, where advertisement and corporate branding is printed onto polyester media. Examples are: flags, banners, signs, retail graphics. Types of printing can be divided into: *Direct Print *Discharge Print *Resist Print *Pigment Print *Reactive Print *Acid print *Disperse print *Specialty Print Digital textile printing started in the late 1980s as a possible replacement for analog screen printing. With the development of a dye-sublimation printer in the early 1990s, it became possible to print with low energy sublimation inks and high energy disperse direct inks directly onto textile media, as opposed to print dye-sublimation inks on a transfer paper and, in a separate process using a heat press, transfer it to the fabric. Within the digital textile printing for visual communication a division has to be made in: * low-volume dye-sub printers (e.g., ATPColor, Roland, D-Gen, Mimaki, Mutoh) * mid-volume wide format printers (e.g., Atexco, ATPColor, Roland, Durst, Hollanders Printing Systems, Vutek) * high-volume industrial printers (e.g., Atexco, Reggiani, MS, Osiris, Stork (later SPGPrints), Konica-Minolta, Zimmer)  Production requirements  The ‚Äòtextile market‚Äô comprises many different applications and requirements. The intended use of the fabric is the most important starting point to identify exactly what's needed to produce a specific end-product. A ‚Äòtextile‚Äô product may vary from natural yarns for garments, through to synthetic fibers for flags and banners. A ‚Äòtextile product‚Äô can be a wall mounted banner, a stand-alone pop-up banner, a beach flag, country flag or company flag. It can be a carpet, back-lit frame, curtain, room divider, building wrap, bed cover, a garment and much more. The predominant textile media used in visual communication is a polyester based fabric. In the US, nylon is often used for flags. In northern Europe, polyspun material has been the choice of fabric for traditional flag printing. In today's market, a woven or knitted polyester is the de facto standard. This differs from the predominant coated vinyl or pvc media used in the sign and display industry. The production process needs to fit requirements for the type of ink: high energy sublimation (also known as disperse direct), low energy sublimation (dye-sub), acid, reactive and pigment. In turn, the type of ink chemistry needs to fit requirements for the media (such as polyester, nylon, cotton, silk). Based on the media and ink combination, the choice comes for infra-red fixation, heat-press sublimation or steaming. The structure of the fabric also needs attention, for example whether it is woven, non-woven or knitted. Polyester fabric is printed mostly with dye-sub or disperse direct ink, although UV and solvent inks (including HP's latex formulation) can also be used. The great benefit of sublimation ink is the fact that the colorants will bond with the fibre during sublimation or fixation. The colours are ‚Äòinside‚Äô the media and don't stay within the coating and on top of the media, as it is the case with UV-curable formulations. Even latex inks on porous textiles can suffer from crocking issues or ‚Äòrub-off‚Äô. Low energy sublimation ink is easier to print with, but has the disadvantage of colours fading faster; its UV resistance, or light-fastness, is less resistant than equivalents using high energy disperse direct ink. Dye-sub can also suffer from a ‚Äòhalo‚Äô effect which results in less sharp images. The disperse direct ink is a ‚Äòstronger‚Äô ink than the dye-sub kind, and this is very important for outdoor use, such as for fence fabric, flags and banners: artwork will last longer. Another benefit of aqueous-based sublimation ink is the absence of hazardous components as found in UV-curable, solvent and, even, in latex inks. When executed properly, direct to media printing with disperse ink is achievable on uncoated fabrics and offers maximum print-through; this is essential in applications viewed from both sides, such as with flag printing. As such, products can be sold at a higher margin, with a ‚Äògreen‚Äô label and with a higher quality. Other media and ink combinations cannot allow this. The biggest advantage of direct to media is drastically reduced waste. This method doesn't need printing on transfer paper first before calendering (or heat-pressing) it onto the media. Waste is both an economical and an ecological factor in print production. Print speed doesn't account for much if a large portion is being thrown away as waste due to incompatibility of media, ink, treatment or lack of know-how. The qualities of the printed end product should fit the needs of the application. Longevity, fastness and hand properties are important. Post-processing is something to think about: is the printed material easily confectioned, applied or handled. Should it be washed or does it need a finish (e.g. fire retardant, water repellent). A washed textile no longer has coating or ink residues and will, therefore, have a better feel. Moreover, it will be less prone to stains and it will last longer. However, digital textile printing fabric will fade out with repeated washings, so it should be labeled as dry cleaning only, and the best way is washing by hand with cold water or using washing machine with gentle cycle and use mild detergent. An alternative which does not require expensive equipment and dyes is Inkjet Fabric Printing which uses a standard inkjet printer (e.g. HP, Epson, Canon, Lexmark) and specially treated, paper-backed fabric sheets. Inkjet fabric sheets are currently available in cotton, bamboo and silk on Amazon and other websites. The removable paper backing makes the fabric stiff enough to go through your inkjet printer. Once the ink is dry (1 hour to overnight for heavy ink coverage), simply remove the paper backing, follow the directions for a water dip to set the ink, let the fabric dry, and you are ready to sew.  Economics  As well as material concerns and application issues, economics come into play. Where the traditional textile print industry is accustomed to mass production with long-runs, the digital inkjet business mostly produces short-run non-textile products. This approach to digital textile printing is very different, and so is the expectation. Where sign- makers are familiar with a single process system, traditional textile printing is accustomed to several production steps. In the balance of the economics behind production needs, it is important to understand the entire production flow. An example lies with the choice of fixation equipment and the subsequent implication of energy and resource cost; for example, a steamer needs water and energy, and a calender needs to heat up and uses much energy and considerable amounts of paper. Additionally, the impact on business by legislation and requests from customers with regard to environmentally friendly products, are increasingly becoming a factor.  Growth  In 2015, the industry is valued at approximately US$7.5billion globally. The worldwide digital textile printing market for garment, home d√©cor and industrial applications is experiencing strong growth of around 34% CAGR to 2019.

Construction and commissioning Brunswick originally was authorized as a patrol gunboat with the hull number PG-176, but she was redesignated as a patrol frigate with the hull number PF-68 on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as Maritime Commission Hull 1492 on 16 July 1943 by the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 6 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. K. G. Berrie, and placed in reduced commission on 20 May 1944 for a trip to Galveston, Texas. After arriving at Galveston, Brunswick was decommissioned there on 27 May 1944. She then was fitted out at the Todd Galveston Drydocks, Inc. and was placed in full commission on 3 October 1944, with a United States Coast Guard crew and Lieutenant Commander Benjamin B. Sherry, USCG, in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1945= Brunswick departed Galveston on 15 October 1944 on her way to shakedown training in the West Indies. She arrived in the vicinity of Bermuda and underwent her shakedown evolutions between 24 October 1944 and 22 November 1944. Brunswick embarked upon the first of her three round-trip convoy escort missions to North Africa on 11 December 1944. Steaming from Hampton Roads, Virginia, she arrived in Oran, Algeria, with Convoy UGS-63 on 28 December 1944. On 2 January 1945, she stood out of Oran in the screen of Convoy GUS-63. Soon after the convoy passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, one of its ships, the merchant ship SS Henry Miller, suffered a torpedo hit from the German submarine U-870. Brunswick conducted a depth-charge attack, but U-870 escaped. Brunswick escorted the damaged Henry Miller into Gibraltar and then rejoined the convoy screen. She and the rest of the convoy arrived safely in Hampton Roads on 20 January 1945. Between early February and early June 1945, Brunswick escorted merchant ships on two more round-trip voyages from Hampton Roads to Oran and back. She returned to the Norfolk, Virginia, area from the last of those voyages on 6 June 1945. =Postwar= From Norfolk, Brunswick moved north to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the Philadelphia Navy Yard converted her for duty as a weather ship. She embarked upon her first weather patrol early in July 1945 and concluded her final one on 12 November 1945. Thereafter, Brunswick served in the U.S. Coast Guard temporarily. Returned to the Navy at Norfolk early in April 1946, Brunswick was decommissioned there on 3 May 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 19 June 1946, and she was sold on 9 April 1947 to the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Chester, Pennsylvania, for scrapping.

The caps of pulmonarius are much paler and smaller than ostreatus and develops more of a stem. P. pulmonarius also prefers warmer weather than ostreatus and will appear later in the summer. Otherwise, the taste and cultivation of the two species is generally described as largely the same. In North America, P. pulmonarius also closely resembles Pleurotus populinus, which is restricted to growing on aspen and cottonwood (genus Populus). Natural habitat P. pulmonarius is widespread in temperate and subtropical forests throughout the world. In the eastern United States, this species is generally found on hardwoods while in the west it is commonly found on conifers. Taxonomy *1821 First published as Agaricus pulmonarius by Fr. *1975 Disambiguated from Pleurotus sajor-caju by Pegler Description *Pileus: 5 ‚Äî 20+ cm, convex, becoming broadly convex to flat *Gills: Decurrent *Spore Print: White to yellowish *Stipe: Short and offset from the center of the cap *Microscopic features: Spores white to yellowish to lavender-gray when dense, more or less cylindrical, 7.5‚Äì11 √ó 3‚Äì4 Œºm. Cultivation P. pulmonarius is the most cultivated Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus) species in Europe and North America. The most popular varieties for cultivation are the warm weather varieties, often marketed by spawn manufacturers and cultivators under the incorrect name \\"Pleurotus sajor-caju\\". The real Pleurotus sajor-caju (Fr.) Singer is in fact a separate species of mushroom, which was returned to the genus Lentinus by Pegler (1975), and is now called Lentinus sajor-caju (Fr.) Fries. P. pulmonarius is commercially cultivated in New Zealand, and is sometimes sold as \\"Oyster mushrooms\\". The archetypal Oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, cannot be imported into New Zealand due to perceived risks to their forestry industry. The cultivation of Pleurotus pulmonarius is very similar to how one would cultivate other types of Pleurotus species like P. ostreatus by transferring mycelium from a petri plate onto grain and then transferring the grain spawn after the mycelium colonizes it to substrates of straw, wood chips, sawdust, cardboard, coffee grounds, and other cellulose-based substrates. Medical research Several studies done on animals and in vitro suggest P. pulmonarius and its extracts may have possible medicinal applications for a wide range of conditions. A polysaccharide called Œ≤-D- Glucan from P. pulmonarius reduces sensitivity to pain in mice, and could be an \\"attractive\\" basis for new analgesic medications. In a different study on mice, a glucan from P. pulmonarius showed potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. A methanol extract of P. pulmonarius displayed anti- inflammatory and antitumor activity comparable to the standard reference drugs diclofenac and cisplatin, respectively. A 2010 study concluded that extracts of P. pulmonarius may slow the proliferation of cancer cells with high galectin-3 levels, while at the same time downregulate tumour cell adherence - which is directly related to the progression and spread of cancer. Extracts of P. pulmonarius added to the diet of mice delayed carcinogenesis, suggesting that these extracts may be useful as an adjuvant to cancer therapies. An orally administered hot water extract of P. pulmonarius had a significant antihyperglycemic effect, halted the progression of diabetes, and reduced the mortality of alloxan induced diabetic mice by approximately 50%. It showed a synergistic effect with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide, supporting the possibility of effective combination therapy of glibenclamide and P. pulmonarius for diabetes. P. pulmonarius may be effective in the treatment of hay fever by inhibiting the release of histamine. Powdered P. pulmonarius mushrooms caused a significant reduction in sneezing and nasal rubbing when fed in water to sensitized mice, although the effect gradually builds up over a matter of weeks. When they were given 500 mg/kg a day, a significant effect was observed after two weeks, and it was four weeks before a significant change was observed at 200 mg/kg. Extracts of P. pulmonarius attenuated the development of acute colitis in a mouse model, suggesting a possible clinical use in the treatment of colitis. A further study by the same authors concluded that the extracts also inhibit colon cancer formation associated with colitis in mice. Extracts of P. pulmonarius have antimicrobial properties and exhibit antioxidant activity in vitro.

The ship ran aground on a coral reef, damaging both the ship and the reef. The incident received wide press coverage in Hawaii, in part because of the damage caused to a sensitive coral environment, and also because the stranded ship was within sight of Honolulu off the airport. Navy investigation found that the grounding was caused by a combination of a misread navigation system, a sleep-deprived commanding officer, broken equipment, and an inexperienced and dysfunctional bridge team. Commanding officer Captain John Carroll was relieved of duty and disciplined. Three other officers and one enlisted sailor were also disciplined. The Navy reattached 5,400 coral colonies in an attempt to repair damage to the reef. Grounding Port Royal spent time in the Pearl Harbor shipyard for $18 million in scheduled repairs, then departed for the open ocean off Oahu for sea trials at 08:15 on 5 February 2009. The ship's fathometer was broken. At 12:01, the automated navigation system's primary input was shifted from a forward Global Positioning System to forward Ring Laser Gyro Navigation, an inertial navigator. Three times the Voyage Management System dead-reckoned the ship's location, mistakenly reporting the ship's location as from its actual position. The error was not noticed by watch-standers. The ship was undergoing her first sea trials following the repairs, including full power, steering, and helicopter flight operation checks.Cole, William, \\"Navy Ship Grounding Detailed\\", Honolulu Advertiser, 12 July 2009. The grounding occurred at 8 p.m. about south of the Honolulu International Airport's Reef Runway. No one was injured and no fuel spilled. The location of the grounding was in full view of commercial aircraft landing and departing from the nearby airport, causing embarrassment to the Navy.McAvoy, Audrey, \\"Navy punishes former Port Royal CO\\", Military Times, 5 June 2009.Cole, William, \\"Hawaii-based ship's grounding detailed\\", Honolulu Advertiser, 7 July 2009. The cruiser has a draft of and ran hard aground on a sand and rock ledge in an estimated 14 to 22 feet (5‚Äì7 m) of water. The salvage ship made three unsuccessful efforts to pull Port Royal off the sandbar on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (6‚Äì8 February), despite full-moon high tides and offloading of fuel and water, of raw sewage, and of crew members.Kakesako, Gregg, \\"Navy Cruiser Dumps 5,000 Gallons of Slop\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 11 February 2009.Kakesako, Gregg K., \\"Extensive Coral Reef Damage Revealed in Ship's Grounding\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 20 February 2009. According to the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the ship ran aground while moving very slowly as she transferred shore-based aviation assessment officials to a smaller boat to take them to shore. The oil recovery ship Clean Islands was behind the ship to clean up oil spills. Rear Admiral Dixon R. Smith, the commander of Navy Region Hawaii and the Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, served as the on-scene commander.Associated Press, \\"Navy Warship Runs Aground Near Honolulu Airport\\", Miami Herald, 7 February 2009. Recovery USNS Salvor and other ships tow the grounded Port Royal off a shoal near Pearl HarborUSNS Salvor debeaches ship grounded in Hawaii On 9 February 2009, Port Royal was pulled off the rock and sand shoal at around 2 a.m. after crews removed another 500 tons of water and 100 tons of anchors and other equipment to lighten the vessel. The removal by a salvage ship and seven tug boats took about 40 minutes. No one was injured during the recovery effort, according to Rear Admiral Joe Walsh, the U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy commander. Smith relieved commanding officer Captain John Carroll of his duties pending investigation. Carroll had been commanding officer of Port Royal since October 2008. Captain John Lauer, an official in Smith's Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, temporarily assumed command. The ship had suffered heavy damage to the underwater bow sonar dome and to its propellers and propeller shafts in the incident, and it was drydocked for repairs. Captain Neil Parrott presided over the investigation into the grounding. Damage assessment and repair Once the raw sewage dumped by the ship had dissipated, divers from the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources examined the site and discovered that the grounding had damaged the coral reef. The Hawaiian divers, with help from Navy divers, began mapping the damage to ascertain the extent of work required to repair the coral. As of 12 February 2009, several of the cruiser's propeller blade tips had yet to be recovered from the ocean floor.Kakesako, Gregg K., \\"Debris From Ship Still in Ocean\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 12 February 2009.Cole, William, \\"Port Royal repairs to cost millions\\", Honolulu Advertiser, 13 February 2009. Laura Thielen, chairwoman of the Hawaii state Board of Land and Natural Resources, told the United States Navy in a letter in April 2009 that the grounding had damaged between six and of the reef and that the \\"main injury scar\\" covered about . She added that the grounding may have damaged the habitat of green turtles.Kakesako, Gregg K., \\"Navy on Notice Over Reef Damage: The state demands that restoration begin before the cost is finalized\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 2 April 2009. On 18 February 2009, the ship entered Dry Dock Number 4 at Pearl Harbor for repair to the ship's shafting, running gear, propellers, painting of the underwater hull, replacement of the bow sonar dome and its internal elements, and repairs to damaged tanks and superstructure cracks. The Navy estimated that repairs would cost between $25 and $40 million and would be completed by September 2009.Cole, William, \\"Navy says Port Royal repairs to run between $25 million and $40 million\\", Honolulu Advertiser, 6 March 2009. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that a shipyard worker had said that no work had been done to repair the warship as of 12 April 2009. The newspaper reported that its attempts to obtain information on the status of the warship had received short shrift or had not been answered by the Navy.Cole, William, \\"Navy not open on grounding\\", Honolulu Advertiser, 12 April 2009. Port Royal in drydock for repairs following the grounding showing damage to the ship's propellersAs of the end of July 2009, most of the repairs to the ship had been completed. Structural problems occurred in rebuilding the sonar dome, the area of the ship most heavily damaged in the grounding. Also, the struts that support the propulsion shafts were found to be out of alignment by a small but critical amount. The repairs were expected to be completed in September and the ship was expected to return to operation in October.Honolulu Advertiser, \\"Port Royal repairs nearly done\\", Military Times, 29 July 2009. The ship deployed for the first time since the grounding in June 2011. The cruiser departed on an eight-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Middle-East. Acting on a request from the state of Hawaii to repair the damage to the coral habitat, the Navy hired divers from AECOM, Sea Engineering and CSA International, Inc. Work to repair the damaged reef began the last week of April 2009.Kakesako, Gregg L, \\"Navy Begins Repair Of Reef And Warship\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 30 April 2009. At a cost of $7 million, by 27 June 2009 the divers had collected 5,400 loose coral colonies and reattached them to the reef using cement and plaster of Paris.Cole, William, \\"Navy Ship Recovers Wayward Anchor\\", Honolulu Star- Advertiser, 17 August 2012, p. 19 The divers also removed of rubble.Honolulu Star-Bulletin, \\"5,400 coral colonies reattached by Navy\\", 27 June 2009. The Navy planned to conduct further repair work on the reef between October and December 2009Kakesako, Gregg K., \\"Warship Put Through Its Paces\\", Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 25 September 2009. but this work was later suspended.Honolulu Star-Bulletin, \\"Navy suspends repair work on coral damaged by warship\\", 16 November 2009. The Navy reports that environmental experts have advised them that reattaching further coral to the reef would do more harm than good.McAvoy, Audrey, \\"Navy ends reef repairs from Port Royal incident\\", Military Times, 16 November 2009. Disciplinary actions and investigation findings On 2 June 2009, the Navy disciplined four Port Royal officers for the grounding. In a hearing presided over by Vice Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the United States Third Fleet, Captain John Carroll was given non-judicial punishment for \\"dereliction of duty and improper hazarding of a vessel.\\" Port Royal Executive Officer Commander Steve Okun was also given non- judicial punishment for dereliction of duty at the same hearing. In a separate hearing, Rear Admiral Dixon Smith, commander of Navy Region Hawaii and Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, imposed non-judicial punishment on two other, unnamed Port Royal officers and an enlisted seaman for dereliction of duty and improper hazarding of a vessel. The Navy refused to provide further details of the punishments the sailors received. The U.S. Navy safety investigation into the accident, not intended for public release but which was obtained by the Honolulu Advertiser in July 2009, listed several contributing factors for the grounding. The factors included a misinterpreted navigation system, a sleep- deprived commanding officer, faulty equipment and an inexperienced and dysfunctional bridge team. The report stated that Carroll had only 4¬Ω hours of sleep in the 24 hours prior to the grounding, and only 15 hours of sleep during the previous three days. Also, he was at sea after a five-year break in sea command duty. Carroll had directed that the aviation assessment personnel aboard the cruiser be returned to shore in a small boat just before the grounding occurred. The report found that the ship's fathometer, which measures water depth, was broken, as well as both radar repeaters on the cruiser's bridge. Some time before the grounding, the ship switched navigation systems from a Global Positioning System, called the Voyage Management System, to a gyroscope. The switch caused a discrepancy in the ship's reported position. Audible alarm bells triggered by the discrepancy were disregarded by the ship's crew. During the small-boat transfer, the cruiser's operations officer took a binocular bearing to the harbor landing from the boat deck and noted the position discrepancy, but was unable to correct the ship's course in time. Shortly thereafter, the ship ran soft aground, but then quickly was forced hard aground by the force of the waves. The report concluded that in spite of the equipment and navigation systems failures, there were enough working sensors and visual clues to prevent the grounding. The report found that the ship's navigation evaluator lost situational awareness and that the \\"Bridge watch team, navigation, and (Combat Information Center) team did not work together to assess situation and keep the ship from standing into danger.\\" Qualified lookouts were on board for watch duty the night of the grounding, but they were working in the mess as food service attendants and were not allowed to assume the watch. Furthermore, set and drift were not calculated. The report stated that the cruiser had been rushed out of dry dock, with some work scaffolding removed from the ship only 30 minutes before the cruiser departed for the ocean trials. Also, the quartermaster of the watch was inexperienced and lacked training, having stood three months of watch on a deployment a year earlier, but could not plot fixes in near-shore waters. The report recommended a supervisory-level navigation course, as well as an \\"operational pause\\" of at least 96 hours between shipyard availabilities and sea trials to ensure crews were adequately rested and prepared for underway operations. Captain W. Scott Gureck, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Fleet, declined to comment on the investigation's findings. The report was created by the Naval Safety Investigation Board but has been classified by the Navy Judge Advocate General as a \\"Dual Purpose Investigation\\". The Navy will therefore not release the report under the Freedom of Information Act.Letter, Cmdr. M. Robb Hyde, Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General, to FOIA Requestor (7/27/09). Reportedly, the Navy does not want to publicly discuss what caused the grounding because of threatened legal action by the state of Hawaii. Aftermath Port Royal undergoing repair in drydock following the groundingPort Royal left dry dock at Pearl Harbor on 24 September 2009 for final repairs and assessment before being returned to duty. While in dry dock, technicians from BAE Systems and the navy replaced the cruiser's sonar dome, reinstalled rudders, and made structural repairs to the ship's tanks, superstructure, and underwater hull. In addition, four sections of shafting were replaced, struts that support the propulsion shafts were realigned, and the underwater hull was repainted with blue antifouling paint. In February 2011, the Navy and the state of Hawaii announced that they had reached a settlement on the damage caused by the grounding. The Navy agreed to pay Hawaii $8.5 million. The amount was in addition to the $6.5 million already spent by the Navy in efforts to repair the reef. \\"This settlement agreement recognizes the State of Hawaii's loss of a natural resource and takes into account the U.S. Navy's unprecedented efforts to restore the reef where USS Port Royal ran aground,\\" said Rear Admiral Timothy Giardina, U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy commander. In response, William J. Aila, State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources interim chairperson, stated, \\"We believe the Navy has done the right thing by acknowledging its responsibility, working cooperatively with the state to restore the reef, and completing a settlement that will provide funding for protection of the state's marine resources.\\"Honolulu Star-Advertiser, \\"Navy To Pay State $8.5 Million For Port Royal Grounding\\", 5 February 2011. After $40 million in repairs, the cruiser deployed for the first time since the grounding in June 2011. The cruiser departed Pearl Harbor on a seven-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Middle East. Said Smith, commander of Navy Region Hawaii and Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, of the grounding incident upon the departure of the ship, \\"I've put it behind me. We've moved forward. The ship has moved forward. It was an unfortunate incident that we all learned from.\\" Navy command was said to have lost confidence that the vessel had been restored to seaworthiness, and, because of that, the ship was included on a list of seven cruisers slated for early retirement. Decommissioning in anticipation of eventual dismantlement was set for 31 March 2013. However, in answer to queries by Congress, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), in a report sent to Congress in May 2013, reported that the condition of the ship was comparable to certain other cruisers in the same class and that the effects of the grounding might not have been as severe as had been previously thought.

The company also supplied SaaS (software as a service) capabilities which powered market data features for over 200 other websites such as Barclays Global Investors, Piper Jaffray, Quick & Reilly, the San Francisco Chronicle and Wired News. Archived copy at WebCite (June 15, 2009). Stockpoint was later acquired, and is now part of Dow Jones Client Solutions, a division of News Corporation, and Interactive Data Corporation. Business overview Stockpoint had two core parts of its business: * a B2C (business- to-consumer) website. The company's website was first launched as InvestorsEdge.com in 1995, and changed its name to Stockpoint.com in 1997. The site offered free lookup of stock quotes, charts of historical performance, mutual fund comparisons, financial news, and more. Competitors in Stockpoint's early years included Quote.com and MSN Investor (now MSN MoneyCentral). * a SaaS (software as a service) offering for companies wanting to integrate financial information and data into their own websites. For example, the San Francisco Chronicle and Wired News websites both used Stockpoint's solutions to provide financial data features on their sites. In addition, some companies used Stockpoint solutions to add financial features to corporate Intranets, for example tracking the performance of mutual funds in a company's 401(k) plan. As online trading accelerated in the mid to late 1990s, Stockpoint became a leading SaaS supplier of market data tools to banks and brokerage firms, primarily oriented toward their retail investor websites. In 1997, Stockpoint developed technology which dramatically lowered the cost and complexity of customizing a SaaS solution for individual corporate clients. This led to increasing growth and profitability for the SaaS part of the business. Meanwhile, increased competition put pressure on margins of the B2C website. Eventually, custom SaaS solutions became the focus of the company, with the B2C website serving as a proving ground for new SaaS features. After the company was acquired by competitor MarketWatch in 2003 (see below), the stockpoint.com website was retired, and the SaaS solutions continued. Early history The company‚Äôs lineage can be traced to Ethos Corporation, a California company that was commonly known as InvestorsEdge, and Neural Applications Corporation, a Delaware corporation based in Coralville, Iowa. Ethos was founded in 1994 by Patrick Connolly, Sean John Connolly, Chris Dominguez, and Michael Bloom. Neural was formed in 1993 by Harry O. Hefter, Robert Staib, and William Staib to coincide with an investment from Equity Dynamics, a private equity firm. Early employees that formed Stockpoint and its product offering included Matthew Barry, Luan Cox, Laura Watts, Justin Grant, Susan Hense, Rob Lamb, and Jeff Broderick, Joe Altmaier, Naftaly Stramer, Josh Hatwich, Paul Juffer, Santosh Ananthraman, and Bob Squires. After a short stay in Mill Valley, CA (home of Ethos‚Äô founders) Ethos relocated to the Financial District, San Francisco, California in an office directly above a popular bar, the Royal Exchange. The company hosted a raucous annual party at its San Francisco offices in honor of Saint Patrick's Day. Ethos in its first years fit the image of a stereotypical startup. The sole conference room doubled as an engineer's office, and business meetings were often interrupted by a frantic developer running in to fix an urgent bug. Early employees had to build their own offices and bring in their own desks and chairs. Rock music and beer were common in the office, suits and ties were not. Like many small startups, Ethos benefitted from partnerships with larger companies, such as Hewlett Packard. and Microsoft, looking to gain credibility via association with popular websites. Partners in turn provided publicity and discounts which helped Ethos to survive on a small budget in its earliest days. For its part, Neural also had an entrepreneurial culture, but given its heritage in providing industrial data-mining solutions, substantial venture funding from the Midwest, and its primary location in Iowa, the company had a more formal office environment. In 1995, Neural began building a Java-based financial services application that was launched in April 1996 as NetProphet. The Neural and Ethos teams became acquainted in late 1996 and reached a common vision for combining Ethos‚Äô marketing strengths, presence in the Bay Area, and InvestorsEdge.com website with Neural‚Äôs engineering expertise, data-mining capabilities, and more established corporate infrastructure. Neural purchased Ethos as a pooling of interests transaction on May 5, 1997. Creation of Stockpoint name and growth of the SaaS business ‚ÄúStockPoint‚Äù was first announced on October 1, 1997 as a product that combined Ethos‚Äô InvestorsEdge website with Neural‚Äôs NetProphet Java-based charting and trading software. On October 20, 1997, Neural announced that its entire financial services business unit had been renamed to ‚ÄúStockpoint‚Äù. Starting in 1998, Stockpoint realized significant growth. Under Luan Cox's sales leadership, revenues grew from $462,000 per quarter in mid 1998 to $6.8 million per quarter ($27 million annualized) by the end of 2001. In September, 1999, Neural changed its name to Stockpoint to reflect its focus on its financial services offerings. During the 1998 to 2001 ‚Äúhypergrowth‚Äù phase, Stockpoint quickly expanded its staffing while it worked to establish mature business processes. Stockpoint filed on March 31, 2000 for its initial public offering. At that time, Stockpoint had 134 employees based in Coralville, Iowa, San Francisco, New York, and London. During this growth period, there was substantial personnel change and some founders of both Ethos and Neural left for other opportunities or for personal reasons. In its final Form S-1 SEC filing in September 2000, Stockpoint listed its directors and executive officers as: * William Staib, CEO, Director; Scott Porter, CFO; Luan A. Cox, EVP, Sales; Chris Dominguez, EVP; Carolyn Mattimore, VP, Marketing; Santosh Ananthraman, VP, Research; Naftaly Stramer, VP, Development; Harry Hefter, Chairman; Outside Directors: David Sengpiel, Terry E. Branstad, George G. Daly, B. Thomas Henry Despite Stockpoint having a customer base of predominantly stable enterprise customers with multiyear contracts, Stockpoint was unable to complete its public offering due to the poor stock market conditions that coincided with the burst of the dot-com bubble. Stockpoint withdrew its registration statement for a public offering in April 2001. Acquisitions and later history Stockpoint was acquired by content aggregator ScreamingMedia in August 2001 for $21M. Top executives of Stockpoint stayed on to manage the combined company‚Äôs technology, sales, and content teams. ScreamingMedia, which changed its name to Pinnacor in 2002, was acquired by MarketWatch in 2003 for $103M. Over time, stockpoint.com website traffic was merged into marketwatch.com, while Stockpoint's SaaS offerings continued. MarketWatch was acquired by Dow Jones in 2004 for $519M. Stockpoint's SaaS services continued as part of Dow Jones Client Solutions. Dow Jones was acquired by News Corp in 2007, and some of the ex-Stockpoint pieces of Dow Jones Client Solutions were sold to Interactive Data Corporation in 2009.

The parade was founded in 2014 by activist Karina Velasco Michel, after years of fighting for it and after several moves against homophobia in the city of Guadalajara, this city was the first city in the country after Mexico City in which the movement openly gay gushed as well as demonstrations and marches demanding equal rights for the LGBT community. While the first demonstrations in Guadalajara and gay organizations were heavily consolidating in the 1980s severely harassed by then ultra-conservative government, currently the event is a well known and respectable gay parade in the world and every year dissemination and quality are observed during every edition. This gay parade in Guadalajara, is one of the most leading prides in Latin America along with cities such as Mexico City, S√£o Paulo and Buenos Aires. This event is celebrated every antepenult week of June The Guadalajara Pride celebrations are usually preluded by a week of cultural events focused on the LGBT community to promote human rights and practice the right of freedom of speech, this week is called Semana de la diversidad (week of the diversity) and host the famous MIX Festival which is the International LGBT Film Festival of Guadalajara (MIX Festival de Diversidad Sexual en Cine y Video), also several art expositions, conferences, AIDS marathons, concerts and several artistic and cultural activities which are a well known characteristic of Guadalajara city, Guadalajara Pride has the special feature that since 2014 took the emblematic Glorieta de la Minerva as the starting point of the Pride and culminating in Guadalajara main square called Plaza de la Liberaci√≥n.  History  In Mexico the first openly gay movement was in 1978 when a gay contingent participated in the solidarity march commemorating the tenth anniversary of government repression of the October 2, the first gay pride march was held in Mexico City in 1979 organized by the Homosexual Front of Revolutionary Action, the autonomous group Oikabeth Lesbian and the Gay Liberation group LAMBDA. 1983 saw the birth of the Gay Pride group GOHL led by Pedro Preciado, a tapatio activist who decided to create this group after the discriminatory and arbitrary arrests and harassment of homosexuals by the Metropolitan Police during the Flavio Romero de Velasco government period, which was characterized by repression of the gay community in the 1980s. The first movement was organized by GOHL the same year in the summer of 1983 in protest of the atmosphere of hostility and repression that violated the civil rights of thousands of homosexuals in the city of Guadalajara. Both this and the rest of the movements and events that GOHL tried to organize were backed by the government of Romero de Velasco, and for almost fifteen years public demonstrations in support of homosexual groups were repressed by the government, though some cultural days and events were held during those years. Years later in 1991 the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA), which is a global partnership that works with the United Nations Organization and the European Union to promote the rights of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender people in the world, proposed to the city of Guadalajara to host the international conference for lesbian and gays this event takes place yearly in major world capitals, but the proposal was truncated by strong opposition from the groups in power at that time headed by State government and the four municipalities of the metropolitan area ruled by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional and the conservative church led by Archbishop Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.

At approximately long, it is the longest cave of its kind known in Arizona. The cave was discovered by some lumbermen in 1915 and has historically been referred to as \\"Government Cave\\" due to its location on the eastern edge of Government Prairie and southeast of Government Peak. Today, Lava River Cave is freely accessible to the general public. 30 seconds long time exposure captured from inside the lava tunnel. The illumination done by using two flashlights. Geologists believe the cave was formed sometime between 650,000 and 700,000 years ago when molten lava erupted from a volcanic vent in nearby Hart Prairie. The top, sides and bottom of the flow cooled and solidified, while lava in the middle flowed out, leaving a hollow space to form the cave. Examples of both  ªA ªƒÅ and PƒÅhoehoe basaltic lava can be seen in the cave. The cave is mostly dry, but due to the temperature change, there is a lot of condensation on the walls, ceiling and floor near the entrance, which makes it slippery. Temperatures inside are around 40 ¬∞F (5 ¬∞C) during the summer, and it is not uncommon for some of the rocks to be covered with ice. The cave can range in height from to only , although the latter only at a side passage that rejoins the main tunnel. There are no light sources inside. It is recommended visitors have sturdy hiking boots, warm clothing, and multiple sources of light. Litter and graffiti have been problems since the late 1960s. A major restoration effort was organized in May 1991. Almost all the litter was packed out and much of the graffiti removed at that time.

The battery was raised at Lavernock on 21 January 1917 under the auspices of the Glamorgan Royal Garrison Artillery, a unit of the Territorial Force (TF) serving in No 26 Coastal Fire Command in South Wales, responsible for the defence of Swansea, Cardiff and Barry. Since 1914 the TF's coastal defence units had been supplying cadres of trained gunners to form new batteries of RGA siege guns for service on the Western Front. The Glamorgan RGA had already formed at least three such batteries (96th, 121st, and 172nd).Frederick, p. 704.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 402, 409. Battery Sergeant-Major (BSM) George Evans, a TF veteran who had already seen active service, served as the provisional commander. In early February, 1917, 2nd Lt George Rae and 2nd L. Robert C. Palmer were the first two officers assigned to the battery.House, Short Record. Originally established as an 8-inch howitzer battery, the unit was reformed as a 12-inch railway howitzer battery while training at Lydd Ranges in April and May 1917. War Service The men of 359th Siege Battery went out to the Western Front on 10 June 1917, embarking on the troopship SS Archangel from Southampton and arriving at Le Havre the following day. It joined 19th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) on 27 June, manning two 12-inch railway howitzers, and 19th HAG joined XV Corps on the Flanders coast on 1 July. On 5 July, King George V and the Prince of Wales inspected the battery.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.

Loading a 12-inch railway howitzer on the Western Front. 19th Heavy Artillery Group transferred south to join Fourth Army on 1 August. The battery was without its guns from 8 to 20 September, and then it joined 76th HAG with Second Army in the Ypres Salient on 21 September, moving to the command of 5th HAG on 28 September. It was separated from its guns again from 1 until 22 October, by which time Second Army was fighting the last stages of the Battle of Passchendaele. On 14 November the battery transferred to 80th HAG, but that headquarters was sent to the Italian Front, so the battery came under the command of 84th HAG on 21 November, and finally of 11th HAG on 18 December. In January 1918, the battery became 'Army Troops' and was no longer attached to a Heavy Artillery Group. While in the Ypres Salient, 359th Siege Bty was positioned at different times at Vierstraat, Oaten Wood, Passchendaele, Wytschaete Ridge, Verbrandenmolen, Voormezele, Borre Yard, and Wulverghem. At Voormezele, on the evening of 3 April 1918, BSM Evans and four others were killed by one enemy artillery shell. Wulverghem was the last position for the 359th, because rail tracks could not be laid fast enough to keep the railway guns within range of the retreating enemy during the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive. It was still serving with Second Army when the Armistice came into force in November 1918.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M.

His brother Christian was later to become Minister of Justice in Austria. Broda was strongly influenced by his uncle Georg Wilhelm Pabst, a famous film director, and Egon Sch√∂nhof, who returned to Austria as a convinced communist after serving time as a prisoner of war in Russia. Whilst studying at the University of Vienna Broda took part in the communist resistance against the National Socialists. During this period he was imprisoned several times because of his political activities. Broda emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1938.  Scientific career  Broda had his Ph.D. in Chemistry approved in 1934 at the University of Vienna. From 1940 he worked at the Medical Research Council at the University College London, researching the transformation of light into chemical energy. From 1941 he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory, on radioactivity and nuclear fission. At this time he made intensive studies of the work of Ludwig Boltzmann. In 1947 he returned to the University of Vienna. From 1955 until 1980 he served as Professor for Physical chemistry. His major work as a scientist - Evolution of the Bioenergetic Processes - was published in 1975\\\\.  Political initiatives  Broda became a member of the Pugwash movement, in support of nuclear disarmament. He also worked to propagate the use of solar energy, and in 1979 he was awarded the Austrian Award for the Protection of Nature, for his initiatives concerning a projected power plant in D√ºrnstein, Wachau. He was given an honorary funeral at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.  Alleged espionage  In 2009 Broda was accused of espionage in a book based upon the journalist Alexander Vassiliev's access to formerly undisclosed KGB archives.ISBN 978-0-300-12390-6 Copyright 2009 John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassiliew According to the book, KGB reports from August 1943 suggest that Broda (\\"Eric\\") was the main Soviet source of information on British and American nuclear research at this early time.

She is also an animal rights advocate, as well as a former co-owner of Sticky Fingers, an all-vegan bakery in Washington, D.C. Personal life The daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Howard Rosenberg, Rosenberg became a vegetarian when she was twelve years old and a vegan in 1994. She was 34 at the time of a 2003 newspaper article. She was formerly married to Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the United States. Career In 1991, Rosenberg became involved in the production of the Genesis Awards television special that is aired each year and which honors individuals in the major news and entertainment media for producing outstanding works that raise public awareness of animal issues. In 1996, she accepted an appointment from Kim Stallwood to join the staff of The Animals' Agenda magazine as Assistant Editor; she later became the Managing Editor. The Animals' Agenda was a bimonthly animal rights magazine (1979‚Äì2002). A number of articles written by Rosenberg for The Animals' Agenda were reprinted in this book: * Table of Contents. Foreword by Jane Goodall. Rosenberg spoke at the Third Annual United Poultry Concerns Forum on December 8, 2001 on the subject \\"Throwing the Baby Out With the Battery Cage: Looking Out for Animals' Welfare in the Pursuit of Rights.\\" Her talk was described by Mary and Frank Hoffman as follows: > Kirsten's presentation came across as a \\"business approach\\" to arriving at > our goals of eliminating animal suffering. She expressed that politics is > the art of compromise, and that in our pursuit of animal rights in the > future, we need to find ways to lessen the suffering of animals in our > present time. \\"Historically, divisiveness is deadly\\", she said, and we need > to support all actions that will help the animals, even in minor ways. Rosenberg's own abstract for her talk was as follows: > What do animal rights advocates want? For most avowed rightists, that's > easy: The complete liberation of animals from human exploitation as quickly > as possible. Yet while we work diligently to achieve such a status for > animals over the long term, we also have a duty to respect the \\"rights\\" of > those individuals who are currently suffering to a life less miserable. To > dismiss opportunities to ameliorate their pain and distress is to treat > those animals as mere abstractions rather than as sentient beings inherently > worthy of consideration now-a position, ironically, often held by the very > exploitive institutions we seek to overturn. After The Animals' Agenda closed down, Rosenberg relocated to Washington, D.C., where she met Doron Petersan through her animal rights activism. Inspired by her desire to promote veganism, she joined in Petersan's restaurant business, Sticky Fingers, remaining as co-owner until she decided to focus instead on singing.

He belonged to the prominent Al-Azm family and was the uncle of As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who succeeded him as governor of Damascus, and Sa'deddin Pasha al-Azm, who also served as governor of Egypt. Early Life Sulayman Pasha al-Azm was the son of Ibrahim al-'Azm, \\"a rural notable possibly of Turkish stock\\", who was sent to Ma'arrat al-Nu'man to restore order in the mid-seventeenth century. Upon his father's death, Sulayman, alongside his brother Ismail Pasha al-Azm, completed their father's task and were rewarded by the Ottoman administration with hereditary tax farms in Homs, Hama and Ma'arrat al-Nu'man. Governorship of Damascus Shortly after gaining the post of wali (governor) of Damascus Eyalet, a bread riot erupted in Damascus city during the winter of 1734. Because of al-Azm's perceived inaction during the riot, local mobs attacked grain storehouses that personally belonged to him. He responded quickly and had four demonstrators hanged, infuriating popular opinion in the city. When he left afterwards to fulfill his duties as amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan), \\"no one [on the caravan] greeted him.\\"Grehan, 2007, p.87. Later in 1734‚Äì1735, al-Azm improved his reputation by embarking on a campaign of energetic reforms, abolishing unspecified abuses that harmed local artisans. The abundant wheat harvest that spring was critical to his rehabilitation in the eyes of the people of Damascus. Sulayman commanded the Hajj caravan for the final time beginning in December 1742 and returning to Damascus in April 1743.Joudah, 1987, p. 36. Later in 1743, another bread riot occurred in Damascus, with hungry mobs attacking the courthouse, driving out the qadi and storming local bakeries. Al-Azm attributed the uprising to the tampering of the food supply by the grain owners, millers, and wholesalers. He issued threats to the above individuals and bread reappeared on the market immediately. In a show of gratitude to al-Azm, \\"The people prayed for His Excellency [the Governor].\\" That same year al-Azm sponsored public celebrations upon the occasion of his son's circumcision. He decorated the markets and arranged for seven days and nights of singing, dancing, and other amusements. On the final day of celebrations, he staged a mass circumcision for poor youths and in an act of zakat (\\"charity\\"), he showered two gold coins and a new garment on each boy.Grehan, 2007, p.229. Conflict with Zahir al-Umar and death Beginning in the 1730s, Zahir al-Umar, an Arab sheikh, emerged as a local strongman in the Galilee (administratively part of Sidon Eyalet), which Sulayman Pasha had opposed while he was wali of Sidon between 1728‚Äì1730. In the late 1730s, shortly before his dismissal as wali of Damascus, Sulayman Pasha commenced an expedition against Zahir in the latter's headquarters in Tiberias. Sulayman's justification for attacking Zahir was that the latter was an ally of the Bedouin tribes that threatened the safety of the annual Hajj caravan and was a potential obstacle to the collection of taxes in the Galilee. The fortifications of Tiberias prevented the city's fall, but in the fighting outside of its walls, Zahir's brother Salih \\"Abu Dani\\" was captured by Sulayman's allies and later hanged in Damascus.Joudah, 1987, p. 35. During Sulayman's second term as wali of Damascus, he renewed the campaign against Zahir, who by then expanded his control to Safad, Nazareth, and the western Galilee. On 3 September 1741, Sulayman departed Damascus to subdue Zahir and assembled a coalition of local forces including Druze clans from Mount Lebanon, the clans of Jabal Nablus, Bani Saqr tribesmen, and the district governor of Jerusalem. Sulayman's coalition besieged Tiberias for nearly 90 days, but were unable to capture the city, whose defenses Zahir had significantly reinforced. Zahir used the time during which Sulayman was away commanding the Hajj caravan to strengthen Tiberias and his minor fortresses such as Deir Hanna and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, after addressing internal matters in Damascus, Sulayman launched a third expedition against Zahir with the authorization of Sultan Mahmud I and the backing of the provincial governors of Tripoli and Sidon, and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza, Ramla and Irbid in addition to his own troops. Sulayman also had the backing of the Mount Lebanon Druze, but their access to the Galilee was stifled by Zahir's Shia Muslim allies in Jabal Amil. Sulayman decided to change tactics and assault Zahir's lesser Galilee fortresses, from which Tiberias received reinforcements and resupply, to cut Tiberias off from the outside. However, these plans were voided when Sulayman suddenly fell ill and died in the village of Lubya near Tiberias in August. Sulayman's forces were subsequently attacked by Zahir's forces and dispersed.Joudah, 1987, p. 37.

Meyers Memorial Lecture) is an annual free public Lecture hosted by the University of Queensland Medical Society (UQMS) in Brisbane. Professor Errol Solomon Meyers was a founding father of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Queensland, which was established in 1936 after five decades of advocacy for a medical school in Queensland. A pioneer in professional health education in Queensland, Professor Meyers was a leader in postgraduate medical education and undergraduate and postgraduate dental education prior to the establishment of the Faculties of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Queensland. In July 1957, one year after the death of this founding father, the University of Queensland Medical Society established the E.S. Meyers Memorial Lecture to honour his contributions to medicine in general, and to his role as one of the most significant founders of the Medical School in particular. As a reflection of the ethos of Professor Meyers‚Äô life, this Memorial Lecture comprises a forum for a person of distinction to present a perspective of endeavour and achievement. Past speakers include biologist Lord Robert Winston, cricketer and politician Mr Imran Khan, Nobel Laureate Professor Peter Doherty, author Lord Jeffrey Archer and mountaineer and diplomat Sir Edmund Hillary. Professor Errol Solomon Meyers Errol Solomon Meyers Professor Errol Solomon Meyers was a key founder of the University of Queensland School of Medicine. From 1925, he was a leader in postgraduate medical education courses conducted at the British Medical Association (Queensland Branch), and was the doyen of surgical anatomy. A general surgeon and teacher of outstanding ability, Professor Meyers taught anatomy and surgical dissection to dental students in Brisbane from 1922, establishing an Anatomy School within the dental hospital in George Street in 1927. From that time Dr Meyers brought the strength of his considerable personality to bear on the need to establish a School of Medicine in Queensland, a triumph achieved finally on 13 March 1936. Education was one of Professor Myers‚Äô passions. Discussions around the need for a medical faculty in Queensland began as early as 1893, and from the mid-1920s Professor Meyers advocated this case strongly. When the Faculty was finally inaugurated in 1936, Professor Meyers was appointed lecturer in anatomy, before becoming Dean in 1941. His standing as a medical educator was such that he was one of only two Australians to be invited to speak at the inaugural World Conference on Medical Education in 1953. Despite all of these accolades, perhaps the best marker of Professor Meyers‚Äô success was his standing within the student body. Professor Meyers exhibited all of the qualities of an exceptional clinical teacher including a passion for education and enthusiasm for learning. He was much loved, admired and respected by the medical student body for his contribution to medical education. The Memorial Lecture The Errol Solomon Meyers Memorial Lecture is the premier academic event on the University of Queensland Medical Society‚Äôs calendar. The lecture is a special tribute to the life of Professor Meyers, and a wonderful opportunity to bring together members of the medical, university and general community. The UQMS is grateful for the support and contribution of the Meyers family and our past orators, who have assisted the ES Meyers Memorial Lecture to become one of the largest public lectures of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

After her Navy career concluded, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Forsyth (WPF-102) from March to August 1946. In 1947 she was sold to the Government of the Netherlands, for which she served as the civilian weather ship SS Cumulus from 1947 to 1963. Construction and commissioning Forsyth originally was authorized as a patrol gunboat with the hull number PG-210, but she was redesignated as a patrol frigate with the hull number PF-102 on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as a Maritime Commission Type T. S2-S2-AQ1 Hull by the American Shipbuilding Company at Lorain, Ohio on 6 December 1943. She was launched on 20 May 1944, sponsored by Miss Mary Parsons, and was commissioned on 11 February 1945 with a United States Coast Guard crew and with Lieutenant Commander E. M. Osborne, USCGR, in command. U.S. Navy service =World War II, 1945= After shakedown training in the Caribbean, Forsyth steamed north to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, the base for her future operations as a weather ship. She departed Argentia on 2 April 1945 on her first weather patrol, reporting meteorological data, and maintaining readiness to aid any ship or aircraft in distress. On 12 May 1945, Forsyth was called off her weather reporting station to search through haze and fog for the German submarine U-234, which wanted to surrender in the immediate aftermath of the surrender of Germany at the end of World War II in Europe. On 15 May 1945, Forsyth joined destroyer escort in accepting the surrender of U-234 in the Atlantic Ocean at . U-234 was carrying a German technical mission to Tokyo, Japan, which was still at war with the Allies, where the Germans expected to help the Japanese. Two Japanese officer passengers on board U-234 had previously committed suicide rather than surrender. Later on the day of the capture of U-234, Forsyths medical officer, joined by the doctor from U-234, operated on board Forsyth on one of Suttons men who had been wounded accidentally while collecting small arms on board the submarine. Forsyth carried the injured sailor into Argentia, arriving there on 18 May 1945. Despite the prompt treatment of the wound, internal hemorrhaging proved too severe, and the injured sailor died on 25 May 1945. =Postwar= Forsyth continued her weather reporting duty in the North Atlantic Ocean for five more months. She then steamed south to Recife, Brazil, where she moored on 1 December 1945. Until 1 March 1946, she operated out of Recife on weather station duty. On 8 March 1946, Forsyth departed Recife for Trinidad. At midnight on 14 March 1946, while at sea, she was decommissioned as a ship of the U.S. Navy U.S. Coast Guard service Immediately upon decommissioning at sea, Forsyth was commissioned into the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Forsyth (WPF-102). She steamed from Trinidad to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving there on 23 March 1945, and made one more North Atlantic patrol on ocean weather station duty. She then proceeded to New Orleans, Louisiana, where the Coast Guard decommissioned her on 2 August 1946 and transferred her back to the U.S. Navy. Disposal The U.S. Navy transferred Forsyth to the Maritime Commission for disposal. The Maritime Commission sold her to the Netherlands in 1947. Service as Dutch weather ship In the Netherlands, the ship entered service in 1947 as the civilian weather ship SS Cumulus, performing weather-reporting duties for the Dutch government until 1963.

Though he started his writing career as an author of young-adult fiction, where the father/son conflict is a major theme, he is best known for his later novels of suspense, most of which are set, at least in part, in Italy, reflecting his academic background as a scholar of Italian culture. His thriller League of Shadows, for example, deals with the Fascist Era in Italy and its aftermath in the contemporary world.In an interview, Terpening stated that he first learned of Mussolini‚Äôs secret police, the OVRA, the focus of the novel‚Äôs historical episodes, when he designed a course on Benito Mussolini and Fascism. See Ronterpening.com and the last question in his interview for The Turning: Ronterpening.com A later international thriller, Nine Days in October, came out of the author's course research on the forces of order and disorder in contemporary ItalySee Ronterpening.com and follows a band of criminals and ex-terrorists as they attempt to carry out an assassination plot. All of his novels, including Storm Track and Tropic of Fear, the latter set in Paraguay, are noted for their strong sense of place.See Terpening‚Äôs interview for Tropic of Fear: Ronterpening.com In most of his novels, his protagonist is usually a common man placed in a situation where powerful forces are arrayed against him. While his novels take place in the modern era, Terpening's academic research has focused on Italian authors of the Renaissance, most notably the Venetian Humanist Lodovico Dolce, although he has also published a study of the infernal boatman Charon and numerous articles on other writers of the 15th and 16th centuries. His editing work has ranged from text books, mostly anthologies of Italian literature, to broad studies of Italian culture. Biography =Early life= Terpening was born in Bellingham, Washington in 1946, second son of Harold Russell and Darlene Elizabeth Terpening. His father was a Protestant minister and an evangelist who started several churches in the state of Washington.Contemporary Authors, Detroit: Cengage, 2006, vol. 248. Ron Terpening, Tucson, 1989. After living in Birch Bay, Pateros, and Moses Lake, Washington, Terpening attended grade school in Ferndale, Warden, Wenatchee, and Seattle (in Washington state) and Portland and Gresham (in Oregon). He graduated from Gresham Union High School in 1964. Charon and the Crossing Terpening completed his undergraduate work at the University of Oregon in Eugene (B.A. Romance Languages, Honors College, 1969), where he was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa national honor society. He spent his Sophomore year in Pavia, Italy, and lived in Mexico City for one year. His semi-autobiographical novel In Light‚Äôs Delay narrates several events of those years (1966‚Äì1968).See the Author‚Äôs Note in the preface to In Light‚Äôs Delay (Tucson: Desert Bloom Press, 1988). In his youth, Terpening held a variety of jobs while attending school and first beginning to write fiction: he serviced vehicles in a dairy, worked in a berry growers cannery, on a cement gang in construction, as a striper of panels in a Georgia-Pacific veneer plant, a crew dispatcher for Southern Pacific Railroad, a housekeeping aide in Herrick Hospital (Berkeley, California), a mail handler for the U.S. Postal System in Oakland, and a teacher.Back cover copy, In Light‚Äôs Delay (Tucson: Desert Bloom Press, 1988). He completed his Master's (1973) and Ph.D. in Italian (1978) at the University of California, Berkeley. His revised dissertation was later published as Charon and the Crossing: Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Transformations of a Myth (Lewisburg: Bucknell UP; London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1985). The illustrated book was the first comprehensive study of the underworld boatman Charon as found in the literary tradition from pre-Homeric texts through the early Baroque period in Italy. Thomas G. Bergin (Yale University) said that the book, ‚Äúin grace of an engaging style and a never flagging interest in [the] subject, makes for lively reading.‚ÄùAnnali d‚ÄôItalianistica, vol. 3 (1985), p. 188. =Career= Lodovico Dolce Terpening taught Italian for four years at Loyola University of Chicago (1978‚Äì1982). He worked as an editorial assistant for John Tedeschi on two volumes of the Bibliographie Internationale de l‚ÄôHumanisme et de la Renaissance and was a research fellow of the Mabelle McLeod Lewis Memorial Fund, The Renaissance Society of America, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Endowment for the Humanities in conjunction with the Newberry Library.Back cover, Charon and the Crossing. He also received a fellowship from the American Association of Teachers of Italian to study at the Universit√† Italiana per Stranieri di Perugia (Italy), in 1981. From 1982-2008, Terpening was a professor in the Department of French and Italian at the University of Arizona, where he introduced a new option in Italian Studies for the bachelor's degree, a program that covered Italian culture from prehistoric times to the present. He directed the Arizona Study Abroad Program in Florence, Italy, in 1987, and was co-acting head of the department in 1996. Beginning in 1986, he also served on the editorial board of New Connections: Studies in Interdisciplinarity.

Storm Track His first published thriller, Storm Track (New York: Walker & Company, 1989), was inspired, in part, by Cussler's Mediterranean Caper. As part of the research for this book, Terpening became a certified scuba diver. Storm Track tells the story of a commercial oil-field diver, working on a jack-up off the coast of Tunisia, where his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. William C. McCully (Park Ridge Public Library, Illinois), writing in Library Journal, praised the thriller's ‚Äúnon-stop action‚Äù and ‚Äúbreathtaking pace,‚Äù as well as its settings in Italy, Sicily, Malta, and Tunisia.William C.

Jonathan Pearce (California State University, Stanislaus-Stockton), writing in Library Journal, says that Terpening ‚Äúgets his latest book off to a slam-bang start in Rome with a botched heist by terrorists. During the robbery, a visiting American professor is wounded and his daughter kidnapped, possibly for ransom.‚ÄùLibrary Journal, vol. 132, no. 12 (July 2007), pp. 85-86. Set in 1988, as competing government security organizations are preparing to welcome both the Soviet premier and the U.S. president to Italy, the novel's complex plot, Pearce says, ‚Äúrevolves around a... professor's attempts to find his child while he is unknowingly trapped in an assassination scheme involving rogue CIA agents, venal U.S. executives, Soviet oligarchs, and corrupt Italian security officials.‚Äù He concludes that ‚ÄúThe reader roots for a weary Italian security officer to do his job better than the villains do theirs. The author's research is evidently extensive, the writing competent, the suspense gripping, and the characterization of beastly adversaries and noble protagonists effective. The sense of place is bolstered with such an abundance of native vocabulary and street and building names that Italophiles will feel right at home.‚Äù Cloud Cover Cloud Cover Terpening's latest novel (August 2013) is an international thriller set primarily in Italy and Yugoslavia in the summer of 1984, four years after the death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the authoritarian president of the Socialist nation. By the summer of 1984 the stability of the state had begun to crack, early signs of the dismemberment that occurred in the 1990s.Timeline of Yugoslav breakup Timeline of the Breakup of Yugoslavia. The novel has two protagonists‚ÄîMichael Higgins, a NATO agent in Trieste, Italy, and Fae Avadek, a Canadian spy. Secondary episodes take place in Southern Arizona (Sierra Vista, Fort Huachuca, Tucson), Chicago, Moscow (Russia), and Benghazi (Libya). Home Page of Cliff Edge Publishing. The action begins when a Yugoslav military attach√© defects in Ottawa and is assassinated before the Canadians can interrogate him. In Trieste, at the same time, someone has begun eliminating NATO agents. Higgins, their case officer, is warned by Avadek that he has a traitor in his network. Suddenly, he's running for his life, framed for the murder of one of his contacts. Pursued by an unknown enemy, he falls in love with Fae, whose violent past figures in their search for answers. Meanwhile, Vitali Alferyev, KGB station chief in Belgrade, has been recalled to Moscow, where his superior orders him to withdraw all covert operatives from the sector between Rijeka and Ljubljana. Alferyev's search for the reason leads him into a deadly conflict with a GRU agent operating in the area. The novel reaches its climax in the Yugoslav mountains, where Croatian terrorists, KGB spies, and NATO agents play out the final violent moves in a dangerous game to change the fate of Europe. Higgins and Avadek must sift through layers of deceit and treachery in their attempt to thwart an enemy whose tentacles stretch from the East to the West and from the past to the (novel's) present. In an interview conducted by Contemporary Authors, Terpening said: ‚ÄúMy desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as I suspect it does for most writers, from a love of reading. From early grade school years, when I was given my first books (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in Gresham, Oregon (where I spent most of my free time), to the present, when I teach Italian literature for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book‚Äîboth as an artifact and as a source of delight, a distraction from the constraints of life.

The land here originally belonged to several nobles, including the Marquis of Villamayor. The Royal Customs office was in charge of the regulation of imported merchandise into New Spain and taxing the same, becoming the largest source of revenue for the government. The office originally was on 5 de febrero Street but was moved into the Villamayor house in 1676 because of its location next to Santo Domingo Plaza. Eventually, the government bought the house and rebuilt it in 1730, which is the building that survives today. Eventually, the Customs office in Mexico City closed and it was taken over by the Secretariat of Public Education in the early part of the 20th century. It remains as offices of this government agency. History of the site The land on the east side of Santo Domingo Plaza was given to Captain Don Cristobal de O√±ate, Gonzalo de Salazar and the Marquis of Villamayor soon after the Conquest on which all built residences. As the colony of New Spain developed, foreign trade, especially with the Philippines, other Spanish colonies and Spain itself became a fundamental branch of the economy and the main source of tax income for the Crown, making the Royal Customs Office an important institution from the colonial period until the 19th century. In addition, this office began collecting sales taxes for the colony starting in 1558. It was originally located on 5 de febrero Street and was there until 1676, when it was moved to the houses of the Marquis of Villamayor. This family rented the property to the government for 400 pesos a year while they lived in Spain. This property had been greatly damaged by the flood in 1629, which had made 75% of the buildings in the city uninhabitable for some time. Despite its condition, the site was chosen because of its space and location next to Santo Domingo Plaza, which provided a place for people to wait. This was especially important during times when goods from galleons arriving from Spain or the Philippines arrived into the city. In the late 1680s to early 1690s, permission was sought and gained from King Carlos II to purchase the Villamayor property. At the time, it was in the name of Francisca Maria Bellvis, Marquesa of Benvides and Villamayor, as the titleholder of the land grant established by Don Francisco de Pacheco y Vocanegra. She held it for her son, Joseph Vicente Bellvis y Moncada, Marquis de Belgia who was living in Valencia. Seeing the inevitability of the sale, she agree to accept. the sum of 29,186 pesos for the property. In 1723, it was estimated that the cost of rebuilding the house would be about 40,000 pesos, and Pedro Arrieta was put in charge of the project. Construction of the building, which survives to this day, began in 1729, and finished in 1731. The nuns of La Encarnaci√≥n convent next door were opposed to this project. They had wanted to buy the land themselves. They also were worried that the larger building with expanded storage facilities would attract thieves and block sunlight on their property. Structural problems with the new construction started soon after it was completed. Today, only the exterior, the main stairs and the patios columns are originals with the rest eventually replaces under a number of repairs. Also from the time of the Royal Customs Office was located, traffic along Santo Domingo Plaza had increased dramatically. The new building was designed with two large portals on opposite sides of the building to allow mule teams to enter and exit, but this did little to alleviate the situation. The building was expanded again in 1777 and another round of remodeling work was undertaken in the early 1790s by architect Miguel Constanz√≥. After the Mexican War of Independence, the Customs building remained a tax collection center although it was reorganized in 1825. In 1887, President Porfirio Diaz held a grand banquet and ball here to celebrate his third term in office. The building was decorated with carpets, tropical plants, bronze sculptures, fountains and colored lights. However, shortly after this, internal customs fees were abolished and later this building would house the Federal District Treasury. This led to the building's current name, which is ‚ÄúVieja Aduana‚Äù or Old Customs. Due to the continued growth of the Secretariat of Public Education in the early 20th century, the old Customs building was annexed to the agency along with a number of adjoining houses. This is how all of the buildings on this block came to be joined together, in the 1930s. About ten years later, David Alfaro Siqueiros painted the main stairwell. The building saw another round of restoration and remodeling work by Jorge Medellin in 1991. Description of the current building The building is of a fairly simple design. The facade is of tezontle, a dark red porous volcanic stone, with doorways, windows and balconies of cantera, a white stone. Inside there are two large interior patios with large columns. The main stairwell contains mural work by Siqueiros called ‚ÄúPatricios y Patricidas‚Äù (Patricians and Patricides), which was begun in the mid-1940s but was never finished.

Life He was born in Bolton. Although he was essentially self- taught as a composer, he studied piano, cello and harmony at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where his teachers were Thomas Keighley, Frank Merrick and Carl Fuchs. Later he won a scholarship to study art and cabinet- making at the Bolton School of Art. After training as a teacher, he became art master at Tettenhall College, Wolverhampton. Whilst there, as a pacifist, he joined the Peace Pledge Union. In the Second World War, he registered as a conscientious objector, with a condition that he continue teaching. He taught composition at the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1947 to 1973, where his pupils included David Ellis, John Golland, John McCabe, John Ogdon and Ronald Stevenson. Between 1986 and 1993 he wrote a three volume autobiography. He continued to create art and music until his nineties. He died in Bowdon, Greater Manchester, in 1999. Composition As a composer Pitfield was influenced by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Percy Grainger and Frederick Delius. He was a prolific composer and his compositions include collections of miniatures for students and amateurs, a five-movement Sinfonietta, a Trio for flute, oboe and piano, concertos for piano, violin, recorder and percussion, a Xylophone Sonata, an Oboe Sonata, and solo works for accordion, clarsach, and harmonica. He also invented an instrument called ‚Äúpatterphone‚Äù to produce rain-like sounds. He wrote for many notable artists, such as L√©on Goossens, Evelyn Rothwell, Archie Camden, Dolmetsch, and Osian Ellis. His music was published by more than 50 publishers. Hubert J.

Construction The ship was built in 1518 at the Royal Dockyard of Le Havre, Normandy and displayed the typical shape of a Norman nef (carrack). She had a tonnage of about 100. The vessel could hold approximately fifty people. It was named for the Dauphin of France, Francis III, Duke of Brittany, the heir to the French throne who was born in 1518 to Claude of France, daughter of Louis XII of France, and King Francis I of France. Operational history The French king, Francis I, placed Verrazzano in charge of an expedition to find a new shipping passage westward to China, the elusive \\"Northwest Passage\\". The expedition started with four ships in 1523 from Normandy, La Dauphine being the flagship. Soon after departure the convoy encountered a storm and sought refuge in Brittany. With two ships damaged, only two ships continued; however, La Normande soon returned also, after some privateering, and La Dauphine continued alone to Madeira for the winter. With supplies for an eight-month voyage, Verrazzano left Madeira on 24 January 1524. La Dauphine was piloted by Antoine de ConflansThe Mariner's Museum, \\"Exploration Through the Ages: Giovanni da Verrazzano\\" . Retrieved on 20 July 2009. and Verrazzano's brother, Girolamo, the only other person aboard whose name is known, served as navigator and cartographer. Verrazzano arrived at the American continent off Cape Fear in early March, briefly sailed south, and then turned north sailing along the Atlantic shore. Pamlico Sound was entered and Verrazzano's exaggerated description of it gave birth to the concept of Verrazzano's Sea as a cartographic error for the next century. Verrazano's Sea was declared as a sea connection to the west across the continent. Going farther north La Dauphine sailed too far offshore to encounter Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, but then entered and anchored in New York Bay on 17 April 1524. Verrazzano named the harbor Angoul√™me after a dukedom that belonged to the king. Thereafter La Dauphine sailed farther north, passed Long Island and Block Island, and anchored in Narragansett Bay for two weeks. The vessel then continued and reached the Penobscot River in Maine, apparently missed entering the Bay of Fundy, passed Nova Scotia, and arrived at the already known Newfoundland. La Dauphine returned to Dieppe, France, arriving on 8 July 1524. Reconstruction A specific plan of the original La Dauphine does not exist. A reconstruction model that has been on display at Dieppe, is considered imperfect. The Maritime Museum of Rouen has been working on a project to create a full-size replica of her. Currently a 1/50 model of La Dauphine has been created, and building plans are being developed, based on best evidence of contemporary documents and similar types of ships of the period. It is intended that a reconstructed La Dauphine will cross the Atlantic to arrive at New York Harbor, possibly in time for the five hundredth anniversary of the European discovery of the harbor by Verrazzano on 17 April 2024. During the reconstruction the building site at the museum will be accessible to tourists. Note La Dauphine has a later namesake in an eighteenth-century warship of the French Navy.

Black convicts, servants and sailors from the West Indies also arrived in Australia and many of them later integrated into Aboriginal communities.

In fluid dynamics, the process of a laminar flow becoming turbulent is known as laminar‚Äìturbulent transition. The main parameter characterizing transition is the Reynolds number. Transition is often described as a process proceeding through a series of stages. \\"Transitional flow\\" can refer to transition in either direction, that is laminar‚Äìturbulent transitional or turbulent‚Äìlaminar transitional flow. The process applies to any fluid flow, and is most often used in the context of boundary layers. History Reynolds‚Äô 1883 experiment on fluid dynamics in pipes Reynolds‚Äô 1883 observations of the nature of the flow in his experiments In 1883 Osborne Reynolds demonstrated the transition to turbulent flow in a classic experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different flow rates using a small jet of dyed water introduced into the centre of flow in a larger pipe. The larger pipe was glass, so the behaviour of the layer of dyed flow could be observed, and at the end of this pipe was a flow-control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow. Reynolds identified the governing parameter for the onset of this effect, which was a dimensionless constant later called the Reynolds number. Reynolds found that the transition occurred between Re = 2000 and 13000, depending on the smoothness of the entry conditions. When extreme care is taken, the transition can even happen with Re as high as 40000. On the other hand, Re = 2000 appears to be about the lowest value obtained at a rough entrance. Reynolds' publications in fluid dynamics began in the early 1870s. His final theoretical model published in the mid-1890s is still the standard mathematical framework used today. Examples of titles from his more groundbreaking reports are: :Improvements in Apparatus for Obtaining Motive Power from Fluids and also for Raising or Forcing Fluids (1875) :An experimental investigation of the circumstances which determine whether the motion of water in parallel channels shall be direct or sinuous and of the law of resistance in parallel channels (1883) :On the dynamical theory of incompressible viscous fluids and the determination of the criterion (1895) Transition stages in a boundary layer The path from receptivity to laminar-turbulent transition as illustrated by Morkovin, 1994.Morkovin M. V., Reshotko E., Herbert T. 1994. \\"Transition in open flow systems‚Äîa reassessment\\". Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 39:1882. A boundary layer can transition to turbulence through a number of paths. Which path is realized physically depends on the initial conditions such as initial disturbance amplitude and surface roughness. The level of understanding of each phase varies greatly, from near complete understanding of primary mode growth to a near-complete lack of understanding of bypass mechanisms. =Receptivity= The initial stage of the natural transition process is known as the Receptivity phase and consists of the transformation of environmental disturbances ‚Äì both acoustic (sound) and vortical (turbulence) ‚Äì into small perturbations within the boundary layer. The mechanisms by which these disturbances arise are varied and include freestream sound and/or turbulence interacting with surface curvature, shape discontinuities and surface roughness. These initial conditions are small, often unmeasurable perturbations to the basic state flow. From here, the growth (or decay) of these disturbances depends on the nature of the disturbance and the nature of the basic state. Acoustic disturbances tend to excite two-dimensional instabilities such as Tollmien‚ÄìSchlichting waves (T-S waves), while vortical disturbances tend to lead to the growth of three-dimensional phenomena such as the crossflow instability.Saric W. S., Reed H. L., Kerschen E. J. 2002. \\"Boundary-layer receptivity to freestream disturbances\\". Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 34:291‚Äì319. Numerous experiments in recent decades have revealed that the extent of the amplification region, and hence the location of the transition point on the body surface, is strongly dependent not only upon the amplitude and/or the spectrum of external disturbances but also on their physical nature. Some of the disturbances easily penetrate into the boundary layer whilst others do not. Consequently, the concept of boundary layer transition is a complex one and still lacks a complete theoretical exposition. =Primary mode growth= If the initial, environmentally-generated disturbance is small enough, the next stage of the transition process is that of primary mode growth. In this stage, the initial disturbances grow (or decay) in a manner described by linear stability theory.Mack L. M. 1984. \\"Boundary-layer linear stability theory\\". AGARD Rep. No. 709. The specific instabilities that are exhibited in reality depend on the geometry of the problem and the nature and amplitude of initial disturbances. Across a range of Reynolds numbers in a given flow configuration, the most amplified modes can and often do vary. There are several major types of instability which commonly occur in boundary layers. In subsonic and early supersonic flows, the dominant two-dimensional instabilities are T-S waves. For flows in which a three-dimensional boundary layer develops such as a swept wing, the crossflow instability becomes important. For flows navigating concave surface curvature, G√∂rtler vortices may become the dominant instability. Each instability has its own physical origins and its own set of control strategies - some of which are contraindicated by other instabilities ‚Äì adding to the difficulty in controlling laminar-turbulent transition. Simple harmonic boundary layer sound in the physics of transition to turbulence Simple harmonic sound as a precipitating factor in the sudden transition from laminar to turbulent flow might be attributed to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Her poem, Aurora Leigh (1856), revealed how musical notes (the pealing of a particular church bell), triggered wavering turbulence in the previously steady laminar-flow flames of street gaslights (‚Äú...gaslights tremble in the streets and squares‚Äù: Hair 2016). Her instantly acclaimed poem might have alerted scientists (e.g., Leconte 1859) to the influence of simple harmonic (SH) sound as a cause of turbulence. A contemporary flurry of scientific interest in this effect culminated in Sir John Tyndall (1867) deducing that specific SH sounds, directed perpendicular to the flow had waves that blended with similar SH waves created by friction along the boundaries of tubes, amplifying them and triggering the phenomenon of high-resistance turbulent flow. His interpretation re-surfaced over 100 years later (Hamilton 2015). Tollmien (1931) and Schlichting (1929) proposed that friction (viscosity) along a smooth flat boundary, created SH boundary layer (BL) oscillations that gradually increased in amplitude until turbulence erupted. Although contemporary wind tunnels failed to confirm the theory, Schubauer and Skramstad (1943) created a refined wind tunnel that deadened the vibrations and sounds that might impinge on the wind tunnel flat plate flow studies. They confirmed the development of SH long-crested BL oscillations, the dynamic shear waves of transition to turbulence. They showed that specific SH fluttering vibrations induced electromagnetically into a BL ferromagnetic ribbon could amplify similar flow-induced SH BL flutter (BLF) waves, precipitating turbulence at much lower flow rates. Furthermore, certain other specific frequencies interfered with the development of the SH BLF waves, preserving laminar flow to higher flow rates. An oscillation of a mass in a fluid is a vibration that creates a sound wave. SH BLF oscillations in boundary layer fluid along a flat plate must produce SH sound that reflects off the boundary perpendicular to the fluid laminae. In late transition, Schubauer and Skramstad found foci of amplification of BL oscillations, associated with bursts of noise (‚Äúturbulent spots‚Äù). Focal amplification of the transverse sound in late transition was associated with BL vortex formation. The focal amplified sound of turbulent spots along a flat plate with high energy oscillation of molecules perpendicularly through the laminae, might suddenly cause localized freezing of laminar slip. The sudden braking of ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù spots of fluid would transfer resistance to the high resistance at the boundary, and might explain the head-over-heels BL vortices of late transition. Osborne Reynolds described similar turbulent spots during transition in water flow in cylinders (‚Äúflashes of turbulence,‚Äù 1883). When many random vortices erupt as turbulence onsets, the generalized freezing of laminar slip (laminar interlocking) is associated with noise and a dramatic increase in resistance to flow. This might also explain the parabolic isovelocity profile of laminar flow abruptly changing to the flattened profile of turbulent flow ‚Äì as laminar slip is replaced by laminar interlocking as turbulence erupts (Hamilton 2015).

As the primary modes grow and distort the mean flow, they begin to exhibit nonlinearities and linear theory no longer applies. Complicating the matter is the growing distortion of the mean flow, which can lead to inflection points in the velocity profile a situation shown by Lord Rayleigh to indicate absolute instability in a boundary layer. These secondary instabilities lead rapidly to breakdown. These secondary instabilities are often much higher in frequency than their linear precursors.

The station was first started in 1986 as Bright and Easy 828 by the operators of 2XS FM on 828AM the frequency previously used by 2XS before the station switched to FM. Bright and Easy 828 used the 2XS call sign while the call sign for 2XS FM was actually 2XXS. The station played a mixture of Classic Hits and Easy Listening music. In 1988 the station actually became 828 2XS and later Classic Hits 2XS followed by Classic Hits 828. In 1993 the station began broadcasting on 98.6FM and was renamed to Classic Hits 828 & 98.6FM. The renaming to Classic Hits was in no way connected to radio stations around New Zealand rebranding to Classic Hits FM as it was radio stations operated by Radio New Zealand that were affected by this change. However, with the station named Classic Hits 828 this prevented local Radio New Zealand station 98FM (formally 2ZA) from rebranding as Classic Hits and instead became Greatest Hits 98FM using the Classic Hits logo. In 1994 the station was renamed to Magic 828 & 98.6FM and as a result Greatest Hits 98FM was able to take on the Classic Hits name. Magic 828 & 98.6FM and 2XS were later sold to RadioWorks with both stations becoming part of RadioWorks group of local stations known as LocalWorks. In 2004 Magic 828 and 98.6FM was rebranded as The Breeze. In 2005 the 828AM frequency was replaced by Radio Pacific after the Radio Pacific frequency in the Manawatu was used to launch Radio Live, Radio Pacific became BSport in 2007. After Magic was rebranded as The Breeze programming remained live and local but in 2007 all programming outside breakfast was replaced with network programming from Auckland.

Shell description The maximum shell length of this species is 100 mm, but more commonly it grows up to 75 mm. As is the case in many strombids, the adult shell of Lentigo lentiginosus is very heavy and thick, with a characteristic deep stromboid notch, and a flared, very thick and posteriorly expanded outer lip. The columella is anteriorly projected, and the siphonal canal is convex. The body whorl has a notably irregular surface, which is ornamented by spiral cords and rows of blunt tubercles that form elevated knobs on the shoulder. The inner lip is smooth, with a large callus that often spreads over the spire and over the body whorl. The shell has a tall spire, and each whorl of the spire has a row of heavy knobs and groves that nearly completely fold over each other. The shell color is usually white with large irregular brown blotches and dots occurring at intervals over the shell surface. The columellar callus has a characteristic faint silvery gloss. The lateral margin of the outer lips has a series of tan blotches. The aperture is pink to orange on the interior, becoming paler towards the margins.

It is the ratio of solar gain (due to direct sunlight) passing through a glass unit to the solar energy which passes through 3mm Clear Float Glass. It is an indicator of how well the glass is thermally insulating (shading) the interior when there is direct sunlight on the panel or window. The shading coefficient depends on the color of glass and degree of reflectivity. It also depends on the type of reflective metal oxides for the case of reflective glass. Sputter-coated reflective and/or sputter- coated low-emissivity glasses tend to have lower SC compared to the same pyrolitically-coated reflective and/or low-emissivity glass. The value ranges between 1.00 to 0.00, but experiments show that the value of the SC is typically between 0.98~0.10. The lower the rating, the less solar heat is transmitted through the glass, and the greater its shading ability. Solar properties play a significant role in the selection of glass, especially in regions or cardinal directions with high solar exposure. It becomes less significant in situations where direct sunlight is not a major factor (e.g., windows completely shaded by overhangs). Window design methods have moved away from Shading Coefficient to Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), which is defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation that actually enters a building through the entire window assembly as heat gain (not just the glass portion). Though shading coefficient is still mentioned in manufacturer product literature and some industry computer software, it is no longer mentioned as an option in the handbook widely used by building energy engineers or model building codes. Industry technical experts recognized the limitations of SC and pushed towards SHGC before the early 1990s. A conversion from SC to SHGC is not necessarily straightforward, as they each take into account different heat transfer mechanisms and paths (window assembly vs. glass-only). To perform an approximate conversion from SC to SHGC, multiply the SC value by 0.87.

They were designed for operation up to : what would have been the first high speed rail service in the Western Hemisphere. Although was reached during test runs, track conditions and electrical issues limited top speeds to between and in revenue service. The single-ended units were designed to be arranged in two-car sets, which were in turn coupled into four to eight-car trains. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) ordered 61 Metroliner cars from the Budd Company in 1966 as part of a collaboration with the federal government to improve railroad service between New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. After difficulties testing the cars, PRR successor Penn Central began its eponymous Metroliner service on January 16, 1969. Amtrak took over the service in 1971. Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars proved to have poor reliability, with less than two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four cars were successfully overhauled for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price of the cars. Thirty-three more cars were overhauled in 1979‚Äì1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains. Despite their electrical flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, based on the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications: six as cab cars and eight as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. History =Design and production= Metroliners were designed to exceed the top speeds on the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen in Japan, seen here in 1967 On August 9, 1965, with the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 pending, representatives from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), and a private consulting firm began setting specifications for an electric multiple unit high speed passenger train. The PRR and the DOT disagreed on several technical details. The PRR wanted cars capable of , while the DOT desired or even to beat Japan's T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen. The higher speed was chosen, but caused numerous design issues. The PRR wanted cars with cabs on both ends for maximum flexibility, while the DOT wanted 4-car sets; two-car sets with a cab on each end were chosen as a compromise. The Act was signed into law on September 30. The Johnson Administration saw the new service as political capital and pushed for an aggressive schedule. On May 6, 1966, the High Speed Ground Transportation project ordered 50 railcars from the Budd Company, with delivery beginning in September 1967. The PRR paid $10.4 million, with the remaining $9.6 million coming from the federal government. The order consisted of 20 coaches with Westinghouse propulsion systems, and 20 snack-bar coaches and 10 parlor cars with General Electric (GE) propulsion systems. On August 30, 1966, Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania announced plans to purchase 11 additional railcars for upgraded PRR regional service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg. The cars were ordered through Philadelphia commuter agency SEPTA, as the state was not permitted to contract directly with the PRR. The state, SEPTA, and PRR reached an agreement on November 3; the state and SEPTA would each pay $2 million, funded mostly by mass transit grants from the newly formed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the PRR would receive a free 15-year lease of the cars. The PRR soon withdrew after complaints from the Red Arrow Lines and Capitol Trailways (which operated non-subsidized services which competed with the PRR for passengers), and the HUD grants were later found not to be applicable to intercity service, but the order was still placed. This USDOT Silverliner, seen here in 1981, was used to test infrastructure for the Metroliners in 1967. The ancestor of the Metroliner multiple unit railcar was the Budd Pioneer III which had been developed for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1958 as a new concept in long distance passenger service in the east. The cars used new propulsion technologies and lightweight construction in an effort to improve performance compared with older electric multiple unit technology. After a fleet of 55 improved Pioneer III cars referred to as Silverliners were ordered for commuter trains in the Philadelphia area, the United States Department of Transportation placed a follow up order for 4 Silverliners, specially modified for high speed operation on the PRR's Northeast Corridor. Equipped with several modifications, including a semi-streamlined slab end on the front of the lead car, the experimental train ran a series of test runs, reaching a speed of on April 2, 1967. This success allowed Metroliner testing to begin. The new railcars were built for high-floor boarding, with only one door on each car able to serve low platforms. Along with the M1 series built for New York commuter service at the same time, these were among the first high-floor-only railcars in mainline service in the country. High-level platforms were constructed at several stations beginning in 1967. In May 1967, an initial service date of October 29, 1967 was announced. The name \\"Metroliner\\" for the railcars was proposed in June, and one unit was displayed at the Budd plant in July. A Metroliner in PRR livery sitting on the Budd delivery siding off Reading Railroad's New York Branch in March 1968 The first Westinghouse-powered Metroliners were delivered to the testing location at Jenkintown station in the Phialdelphia suburbs in September 1967, and immediately began testing on the Reading Company's West Trenton Line. After multiple failures of the control and propulsion systems at just , PRR executives pushed for the beginning of service to be delayed. On September 20, the start of service was postponed to January 1, 1968. The first two cars began testing on the PRR's main line on November 18, soon reaching speeds up to . The cars reached near Princeton Junction in New Jersey six days later, but the testing also indicated that the cars would not be able to operate anywhere near that speed in revenue service. On December 17, 1967, tests of Metroliners passing older MP54 railcars caused windows to be ripped out of the MP54s due to the pressure drop, indicating that the high-speed rolling stock might not mix well with legacy equipment. On February 1, 1968, the PRR merged with New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The remainder of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8. In June 1968, an agreement was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved the viability of the planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969. =Early service= The first revenue Metroliner trip near Washington Union Station on January 16, 1969 A Washington-New York round trip for VIPs was operated on January 15, 1969. Metroliner service finally started on January 16, 1969, with a single daily round trip leaving New York in the morning and Washington in the afternoon. Echoing problems encountered during testing, several early trains sucked windows off passing trains of MP54 cars. An eight- car train was tested on February 5, but it caused numerous circuit breaker trips and catenary outages, indicating that six cars was the practical limit on train length. Testing on the electrified mainline to New Haven, Connecticut, took place with some difficulties in February. The Westinghouse cars continued to lag behind the GE-powered cars; the former were first tested at with serious issues in February, and did not enter service until midyear. Service was gradually increased, including a non-stop round trip on a 2.5 hour schedule, which was added April 2, 1969. However, problems with the cars persisted; maximum speeds temporarily dropped from to soon after. Due to the condition of the track and signal system, the Federal Railroad Administration never allowed Metroliners to go faster than between Washington and New York. Still, they were the fastest trains in North America and provided speed, comfort and amenities that could compete with the airlines. Two years into the service, half of Metroliner passengers had switched from other modes, and 70% were men on business trips. A Metroliner train in March 1969, two months into service On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars intended for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central refused to accept the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York‚ÄìWashington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead. By March 1970, even as cars continued to be accepted, the DOT began considering modifying two cars under a test program. The DOT and Penn Central began holding meetings in May, deciding to modify one car of each propulsion type at first, followed by four additional cars. Out-of-service rates reached 40% and higher; In June, Senator Clifford Case of New Jersey began pushing the DOT to devote $5 million to the rebuild program to increase reliability. The official two-year demonstration program began on October 1. In December, a feasibility study of upgrading the cars for higher sustained speeds was initiated. By February 1971, top speed had been reduced further to . =Amtrak service= left On May 1, 1971, the newly formed Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail services from Penn Central and the other private railroads. Penn Central's 49 Metroliners remained in service, with Amtrak reimbursing Penn Central's lease payments. The DOT contracted with GE and Westinghouse in June for a R&D; project of further electrical modifications, with detailed plans made in July. On September 8, 1971, Amtrak leased the remaining 12 Metroliners from Budd. With most cars available for use, Amtrak increased frequencies on the profitable Metroliner service. Service reached 12 daily round trips that November, including service to New Haven, but a permanent speed restriction was also enacted. In early 1972, Amtrak considered converting the Metroliners to locomotive-hauled operation; however, with the cars the only new rolling stock in Amtrak's possession, it was decided to continue efforts to increase their operating reliability instead. In February, one GE-powered car was shipped to Erie, Pennsylvania, for the DOT-funded rebuild program, with hopes to modify all cars by 1976. It was followed by a Westinghouse-powered car in March. In late April, Amtrak accepted six of the leased cars for revenue service, which permitted an increase to 14 round trips on May 1. An additional pair of cars were sent for rebuild later in the year. Mid-1970s postcard for the then-new Amfleet coaches, which were heavily based on the Metroliner design In October 1973, Amtrak placed an order for 57 Amfleet coaches, the first of what would ultimately be a fleet of over 600. Although the Metroliner propulsion systems had proved unsuccessful, the carbodies were well-liked, and the Amfleet cars had the same basic structure. By November, the first two rebuilt cars had been completed and were waiting for legal agreements to enter testing. The dynamic braking resistors and the air intakes were relocated to a streamlined bump on the roof, reducing overheating and snow ingestion issues that had occurred when they were mounted under the carbody. The rebuilt cars had a maximum speed of . Two additional cars were completed by February 1974. All four rebuilt cars were tested at up to in May and returned to revenue service as a four-car set on July 1. The rebuilding was largely successful except for continued issues with rough-riding trucks, but it cost $500k per car, more than the original cost of $450k each. Later in the year, Amtrak began an accelerated repair program on the unmodified cars, which had logged over in revenue service, but very few cars were actually repaired. By the end of 1975, out-of-service rate was still 27.5%, and many trains ran with fewer cars than demand called for. In February 1976, Amtrak cut Metroliner service from 15 to 13 round trips because of the lack of serviceable cars. Penn Central's leasehold interest in its 49 Metroliners passed to Conrail on April 1, 1976, but would soon be taken over by Amtrak. In August, Budd unveiled the SPV-2000, a Rail Diesel Car successor built with the Metroliner shell design. Although heavily marketed, the SPV-2000s were extremely unreliable and never achieved the widespread use of the Metroliners and Amfleets. =Rebuilding and replacement= In 1976, Amtrak began seeking new electric locomotives to replace its aging GG1 fleet and speed-restricted E60 fleet. That October, a Swedish AW1Rc4 locomotive pulling Amfleets took over one Metroliner round trip, the first time that a locomotive-hauled train could match a Metroliner schedule. That year, Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 118 Metroliners, dubbed Metroliner II. This projected order was later cut back to 50 cars and finally cancelled altogether. Over 1976, on-time performance halved from 81% to 46%. In November, consultant Louis T. Klauder & Associates issued a report showing that the rebuilt cars had half the maintenance cost of the original cars and recommended an aggressive overhaul program. Rebuilt Metroliners in service in 1980 On February 6, 1977, Amtrak announced plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars as part of a larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month. In January 1978, the New York Times reported that Amfleet-based trains with conventional locomotives had better on-time performance than the Metroliners. In March, as Metroliner cars were shipped to GE for overhaul, a GG1/Amfleet set took over one round trip on a slower schedule. Eight GG1s were regeared for to better meet Metroliner schedules, with the higher top speed balancing the locomotives' lower acceleration. On April 30, 1978, schedules were lengthened to 3 hours 20 minutes as more Amfleet-based trains were used, and the name was modified to Metroliner Service to reflect the changing equipment. Three round trips used Amfleets by May 29, with a 3:25 scheduled running time. Metroliners were gradually replaced in Metroliner Service by AEM-7s pulling Amfleet consists The first rebuilt cars entered service on May 17, 1979. By July, the rebuilt cars operated three round trips, with four by unmodified cars and 4 with Amfleet equipment. 37 Metroliners had been overhauled by November 15, but rebuilding plans were cancelled for the remaining 24. By January 1980, rebuilds covered 6 of 14 daily round trips. Some of these later rebuilt cars received the Phase II scheme, a red and blue front end with a large Amtrak logo across the full width. The first AEM-7 locomotives entered service in mid-1980; capable of with Amfleet equipment, they could readily match Metroliner Service schedules. Three were in Metroliner Service use by August 11, with an increase from 12 to 14 round trips in October. The increasingly unreliable Metroliners were slowly withdrawn as more AEM-7s arrived; the newer locomotives could take advantage of recent track upgrades that the Metroliners could not. A Keystone Service train of Metroliners in 1985. Unlike in Metroliner Service, Metroliners on the Keystone Service were sometimes used in sets of odd numbers of cars. When Amtrak began returning rented Jersey Arrows to New Jersey Transit in late 1980, other equipment was needed to cover Silverliner Service trains on the Harrisburg corridor. Test runs of Metroliners on the corridor began in January 1981, and revenue service began in February, despite warnings a decade before that the cars were not suitable for the service. The last non-rebuilt Metroliners in regular use on Metroliner Service trains were removed on April 1, 1981, followed by the GG1s in May. The last Metroliner Service trains using Metroliners ran on October 23, 1981. With all Metroliner Service trains covered by AEM-7/Amfleet sets, all Keystone Service trains to Harrisburg then used Metroliners, rebranded as Capitoliners. However, by the mid-1980s, reliability had become such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. Amtrak terminated the lease on the 49 ex-Penn Central cars in late 1985, purchasing them outright. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued to be used as coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars. Conversions and disposition =Conversion to cab cars= In the late 1980s Amtrak found itself with a supply of surplus Metroliner cars with problematic propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near- identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end. San Diegan in 1993 The first 23 cab car conversions, which included full removal of the propulsion gear and roof hump, took place around 1988. Ten (9630‚Äì9639) were designated for West Coast routes including the San Diegan, six (9640‚Äì9645) for the Atlantic City Express, and seven (9646‚Äì9652) for Chicago-based regional services. Coach #809 was pressed into cab car service with minimal modifications, making 24 active cab cars by 1990. Five more ‚Äî #822 and 825‚Äì828 ‚Äî soon followed. When the P40 locomotives were produced with 800-series numbering in the early 1990s, the later cab cars were renumbered 9709, 9822, and 9825‚Äì9828. The discontinuance of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and the arrival of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000‚Äì2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter corridor service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab cars have been used primarily on the Keystone Service and New Haven‚ÄìSpringfield Shuttle. In January 2019, Amtrak issued a Request for Proposals for new equipment to replace the 470 Amfleet I cars and ex- Metroliner cab cars then in use. =Other conversions= RTD lines in Denver in 2016 Ten Metroliners ‚Äî eight parlor cars and the two coaches not used as cab cars ‚Äî were used as unpowered coaches to supplement the Amfleets and Horizons on Michigan Corridor and other Chicago-based Midwest routes, funded by the State of Michigan as \\"Michigan Coaches\\". Eight were renumbered 44550-44557; 886 and 887 were not renumbered. One of the coaches, #44553 (ex-#884) was rebuilt in 2013 as Amtrak catenary measurement car #10005. Metroliner car #803 served as cab car #9642 from 1988 to 1996. In June 1999, the Federal Railroad Administration obtained the car from Amtrak. After a yearlong refurbishment, it entered service in November 2000 as T-16 (DOTX 216), a research and track geometry car capable of measurements at up to . It is used to measure track conditions on the Northeast Corridor for the Boston- Washington Acela Express service. Cab car #9652, formerly #821, was leased to Bombardier in August 2000. Converted to test car DOTX 220, it was used during testing of the JetTrain, an experimental high-speed trainset, at Transportation Technology Center, Inc. After the lease expired in 2003, it was returned to Amtrak, then later returned to TTCI as DOTX 222. Snack bar car #863 was converted by Amtrak to #9800, which is used as a business car or conference car for special events and charter trains. It is sometimes used as a crew lounge for special trains. =Disposition= Metroliner# 860, the only Metroliner preserved in original condition, at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania Except for the 9600-series cab cars and the four cars modified for other uses, most of the former Metroliners were scrapped in Delaware between 2003 and 2011. One Metroliner snack bar car, #860, is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in its original paint scheme and interior.

The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1986. With . The district has 80 contributing buildings and one contributing structure in a area. Many of the buildings in this district that were built between the 1840s and the early 1900s were built out of locally mined limestone and fieldstone. Of these buildings, many are in vernacular style, but three other architectural styles are represented: Greek Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1XBR The district includes the Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mills and Cedarburg Mill, which are listed separately on the NRHP. Background In 1842 Ludwig Groth bought land that would become the village of Cedarburg and in 1844 platted the village. Fredrick Hilgen arrived after 1845nrhpinventory1985doc and built a gristmill on Cedar Creek. Over the years, and with business partners, Hilgen also started a sawmill, a planing factory, and a woolen mill. In 1870 the Milwaukee and Northern Railway arrived, opening up new markets. In 1885 the city of Cedarburg incorporated. Some Pivotal Buildings The Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mill and the Cedarburg Mill are separately entered in the NRHP. These are also considered \\"pivotal\\" by the NRHP nomination: * The Cedarburg Brewery Complex at W62 N714-730 Riveredge Drive was begun in the 1840s, making it one of the oldest breweries in southeast Wisconsin. The main brewery was built in 1847-48 of locally quarried limestone. The Greek Revival-styled Brewmaster's House also has limestone walls, 18 inches thick and covered with Cream City bricks. The brewery stables and two-story smokehouse also remain. The complex is also known as the Weber family brewery and the Engels and Schaefer brewery. Kuhefuss House * The ca. 1849 Kuhefuss/Fischer house is one of the oldest houses in Cedarburg. Built in 1849 by George Fisher, the house originally had only two rooms and was made of wood.

Lincoln and Washington Buildings The Lincoln and Washington buildings were built to be used as public schools. The Lincoln building, constructed in 1894, was originally intended to serve grades one through twelve, but as a result of the growing population of Cedarburg, a high school was built not far from the Lincoln Building. This building, named the Washington Building, was constructed in 1908. The Lincoln Building then only served first through eighth graders. Later the first though fifth graders were moved to the Hacker Building, just west and south along the school campus playground. In 1956, when the high school, was moved to its current location, and grades four and five occupied the Washington Building, with grades six through eight housed in the Lincoln Building. The grade school complex included a red brick gymnasium facing on Washington Ave. Eventually a new elementary school was built, the Westlawn Elementary School. The middle school, serving sixth and seventh graders, took over the Washington and Hacker buildings and still controlled the Lincoln building and the gymnasium. Sixth graders were taught in the Hacker building. The seventh grade was divided into two groups. One group went to the Lincoln Building, the other to the Washington building. Students at both schools shared the gymnasium. In 1973, the middle school was moved to Webster Transitional School. The Lincoln and Washington buildings were renovated in 1987. The Washington building is now the Cedarburg City Hall and the Lincoln building is now the Cedarburg Senior Center.http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/Cedarburg/CedarburgHighSchool.htmhttp://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/Cedarburg/CedarburgGradeSchool.htm The Hacker building is now an apartment complex.http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/Cedarburg/HenryHacker.htm References Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:Geography of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin Category:Buildings and structures in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin ","title":"Washington Avenue Historic District (Cedarburg, Wisconsin)"},{"id":"23164265","title":"List of rivers of Orange County, California"},{"id":"23164282","text":"Herbert is a former settlement in Madera County, California.

The group was made up mostly of lesbians such as Jennifer Flynn (who later co-founded the New York City AIDS Housing Network as well as Health GAP), though notable participants also included gay rights pioneer and Stonewall riots veteran, Bob Kohler, and writer, Mattilda aka Matt Bernstein Sycamore. The activists who formed FUQ came together loosely for a few actions in 1998, but the first action attributed to Fed Up Queers was on World AIDS Day, December 1, 1998, when they visited New York State Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn's house in Queens at midnight to protest her stance on names reporting. The group grew out of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (Act Up), Sex Panic!, and the October 19th Coalition. As co-founder Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore wrote, after the success of the political funeral for Matthew Shepard, \\"we tried to create a large-scale radical queer activist group, but we got stuck in endless process and the meetings got smaller and smaller, [so] some of us formed an affinity group called Fed Up Queers to do smaller, targeted actions. ... Originally the idea was that we would only meet when someone had an idea for an action, we wouldn‚Äôt get bogged down in process, but then we mostly went from one action to the next, since someone always had an idea.\\" Sticker created after the murder of Amadou Diallo Fed Up Queers held political funerals for murdered transgender and queer people, and fought restrictive AIDS policies, but focused much of their work on then mayor Rudy Giuliani and the NYPD. Fed Up Queers gained notoriety in the media for three actions: First, they were the first of the more than 1,200 people arrested protesting the murder of Amadou Diallo by New York police officers. As one participant wrote, there had already been \\"protests, but no one was getting arrested and we wanted to raise the stakes. We wanted to block the Brooklyn Bridge, but we only had eight people who could risk arrest, so we said okay, we‚Äôll block the bridge with eight people. That‚Äôs how desperate and angry and empowered we felt.\\" Arrestees eventually included Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, former mayor David Dinkins, and actors Susan Sarandon, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, and Dick Gregory. Second, Fed Up Queers stormed Giuliani's keynote speech to the Log Cabin Republicans at the Roosevelt Hotel (New York). This action made the news because security guards beat and bloodied several activists, and clips of both the beatings and Giuliani making a joke about \\"his activists\\" played on all city television stations. The activists won a civil suit against the hotel, and were represented by well known radical lawyer Susan Tipograph. Third, Fed Up Queers, with the support of Act Up and Health GAP, disrupted kick-off events of Vice President Al Gore's Presidential campaign in three cities, denouncing his role in the threat of trade sanctions against Nelson Mandela's South Africa if it did not repeal the Medicines Act. Ultimately, pressure from Jesse Jackson and activists resulted in the United States adjusting its trade policies to enable poor countries, such as South Africa, to gain access to essential medicines. The group lasted two and half years. Some claim the group disbanded due to tactical disagreements. Others claim the breakup was due to one activist pushing his agenda of cross-generational sex. Various members of the group continued to stage actions using the name, or occasionally reuniting in response to particular events. A new group called Fed Up Queers formed in 2009, in Arkansas.  Notable actions  *Stop the Parade, activists attempted to stop Rudy Giuliani from marching in the Gay Pride Parade by chaining themselves across Fifth Avenue in New York City, June 28, 1998 *Queers Bash Back, march to bring attention to the knife attack of a lesbian in Brooklyn, and murders of gay men and trans people in the city, Brooklyn, NY, September 27, 1998 *Matthew Shepard Political Funeral, New York, NY, October 19, 1998 *Wake Up for World AIDS Day, midnight \\"wake up call\\" to New York State Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn's house in Flushing, Queens, NY.

Built in 1931, it is the fourth courthouse built in Jefferson County. It was designed by Fred Stone and Augustin Babin, and is thirteen stories high. In 1981, an annex was added to the west side of the courthouse.  History  The Jefferson County Courthouse and Annex. The Port of Beaumont in the background.The county has had four courthouses. The first building built by the county was a simple wood structure built to serve as the county jail. The second courthouse was built in 1854 and was a simple two story square structure. A third courthouse, a three-story red brick building designed by E.T. Heiner, was built in 1893. By the late 1920s Beaumont had grown so much that the courthouse was inadequate to meet the needs of the people, and by early 1931 the present brick structure was completed. The architects were Fred C. Stone & A. Babin; the sculptor of the frieze panels and other architectural sculpture was Beaumont sculptor Matchett Herring Coe. The building has retained nearly all of its originality over the years, including its marble interior, but in 1981 an annex was added to the west side to increase space. The annex connects to the original courthouse through the basement, first, and second floors. The only public entrance is through the annex due to recent security upgrades. Floors eight through thirteen of the courthouse once served as the county jail, one can tell by the barred windows. Today the space is used for storage. Restoration A $22 million restoration project is currently underway. Phase one was completed in May 2009 when the copper roof from the 1940s was replaced with a multicolored tile roof, similar to the original. Phase two began August 2010, and will clean and restore granite and windows from the fifth to 13th floor.

His most important extant work is the Tal·∏µƒ´·π£, a biographical dictionary. Biography Ibn al-Fuwati was born on 25 June 1244 in Baghdad. His family originated in Marw al-Rudh in Khurasan. His nisba indicates that one of his parents was a seller of waist wraps (Arabic: f≈´·π≠a, plural: fowa·π≠). Aged 14, he was enslaved and incarcerated by the Mongols at the Siege of Baghdad (1258) and was subsequently brought to Adharbayjan. In 1261/2, he joined Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in Maragheh, and was appointed librarian of the Maragheh observatory by Tusi. While in Maragheh, Ibn al-Fuwati wrote a biographical dictionary of astronomers, the Ta·∏èkerat man qa·π£ada‚Äôl-ra·π£ad (non-extant). He stayed in Maragheh together with Tusi's son and successor Asil al-Din. In 1281, Ibn al-Fuwati returned to Baghdad on the request of Ata-Malik Juvayni and was appointed director of the Mustansiriya School. Ibn al-Fuwati visited Adharbayjan at least three times between 1304 and 1316. He retired to Baghdad after the execution of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in 1318. Charles P. Melville suggests that some of Ibn al-Fuwati's works were destroyed during the subsequent sack of the Rashidiya quarter. Ibn al-Fuwati's religious beliefs were not strictly categorizable, for he is variously claimed to have been a Hanbalite, Shafi'ite, Shi'ite, and Sufi. He drank wine and was renowned for his calligraphical works. He died in 1323 in Baghdad. Literary output Ibn al-Fuwait's most important extant work is his biographical dictionary, the Tal·∏µƒ´·π£. The Tal·∏µƒ´·π£ is believed to be an abridgement of the Majma øal-ƒÅdƒÅb fƒ´ mo øjam al-alqƒÅb. However, it may be that the Majma øal-ƒÅdƒÅb fƒ´ mo øjam al-alqƒÅb never even existed. Melville notes that even if the work did exist, it was probably never completed. The Tal·∏µƒ´·π£ itself was also never completed, for many entries are unfinished or left blank. The exact scope of the Tal·∏µƒ´·π£ is not clearly defined, as it appears to include a wide array of people whose names Ibn al-Fuwati had come across. Most entries cover people from present-day Iraq and present-day western and central Iran, especially Isfahan. Melville notes that the Tal·∏µƒ´·π£ contains a wealth of information about the intellectual and cultural life of the Ilkhanate. Ibn al-Fuwati studied Mongolian and Persian; although he did not write books in Persian, he did own a memorabilia book (majmu'a) for Persian poetry. In his Tal·∏µƒ´·π£, Ibn al-Fuwati occasionally quotes Persian poetry.

Early life Hatherley was born in Southampton in 1981, growing up in a 1930s suburban estate. He describes his parents as \\"trots\\" who were members of Militant. At the age of 12, he moved to the Flowers Estate in Bassett Green, which he disliked, later saying: \\"I couldn't wait to get out of the sodding place, and the pitched roofs and front gardens didn‚Äôt exactly relieve the unpleasantness.\\" When he was 16, he read England‚Äôs Dreaming by Jon Savage, which inspired him to move to London to study. He studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, graduating in 2001. He then received a PhD from Birkbeck, University of London in 2011. Writing Hatherley's first book, Militant Modernism, was published by Zero Books in 2009.

The range of natural distribution is from Clyde Mountain near Batemans Bay in southern New South Wales (35¬∞ S) to Atherton in tropical Queensland (17¬∞ S). The habitat is tropical or sub-tropical rainforest on fertile soils, particularly growing by streams in cooler areas. However, it can occasionally be seen on poorer soils such as at Watagans National Park. Or in temperate rainforests subject to cold weather, such as at Robertson, New South Wales. Identification is simple with the leaves and branchlets, as the zig-zagging pattern is prominent. The crooked leaning trunk is also characteristic.  Description  A medium to large tree, up to 30 metres tall with a stem diameter of 90 cm. The trunk is uneven, bumpy, leaning and crooked. The base of the stem is flanged. Bark is brown or dark grey. Leaves form on zig-zagging branchlets, the branchlets have small brown dots. Leaves alternate, elliptic or egg shaped. 7 to 15 cm long, with a short point at the tip. Leaf veins are raised on the underside and more prominent than above. White flowers form on panicles, 5 to 12 cm long. Individual flowers about 3 mm long with five petals 2 mm long each. Flowering occurs between November and January. The fruit is a black egg shaped drupe, 13 mm long with one seed inside. Fruit matures from October to July. Removal of the fleshy aril is recommended to assist seed germination, which occurs without difficulty.  Ecology  Its fruit is eaten by the grey-headed flying fox and a variety of bird species including: brown cuckoo dove, green catbird, topknot pigeon, wompoo fruit-dove and white-headed pigeon.

In addition, it regularly liaises with the diplomatic corps in Sri Lanka, in ‚Äògoodwill‚Äô meetings and to arrange potential programmes and events of mutual interest. Research programmes LKI's governing legislation provides that it will be dedicated to the study of Sri Lanka‚Äôs international relations and strategic interests in defence, national security, law, economics, cultural relations, agriculture, and the environment. There are two programmes to capture these themes: the Global Governance and Global Economy programmes respectively. The Global Economy programme, chaired by Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja (DPhil Oxford), reflects the shifting emphasis in international relations ‚Äì in Sri Lanka and elsewhere ‚Äì to economic diplomacy. This programme seeks to analyse Sri Lanka‚Äôs trade, foreign investment, and tourism, including the potential to reposition Sri Lanka as an economic hub in the Indian Ocean region. The Global Governance programme headed by Dr. Kadira Pethiyagoda (PhD Melbourne), covers issues relating to Sri Lanka‚Äôs international relations, international law, and security. These involve maritime issues, international dispute resolutions, transitional justice, international human rights norms, sustainable development, and Sri Lanka‚Äôs role in the United Nations, as well as Sri Lanka‚Äôs cultural relations in sports, religion, and the arts. Events LKI hosts four main types of events; LKI Roundtables, panel discussions, speeches, and memorial lectures. Events held at LKI are centered around topics of regional geopolitics, economics and strategic studies. Experts from various institutions and organisations are invited on a regular basis to take part in and contribute to events held at the institute. A signature event at LKI is the annual Lakshman Kadirgamar Memorial Lecture, delivered by a current or former governmental or intergovernmental leader. LKI also regularly hosts Foreign Policy Round Tables which convene a diverse group of participants, including officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, other members of the government, policymakers, scholars from universities and think tanks, media, representatives from the private sector and civil society, and students.

The name of Estonia ( ) has complicated origins. It has been connected to Aesti, first mentioned by Tacitus around 98 AD. The name's modern geographical meaning comes from Eistland, Estia and Hestia in the medieval Scandinavian sources. Estonians adopted it as endonym in the mid-19th century, previously referring themselves generally as maarahvas, meaning \\"land people\\" or \\"country folk\\". Etymology =Origins= The name has a colourful history, but there is no consensus on which places and peoples it has referred to at different periods.Kasik 2011, p. 11 Roman historian Tacitus in his Germania (ca. 98 AD), mentioned Aestiorum gentes \\"Aestian tribes\\", and some historians believe that he was directly referring to Balts while others have proposed that the name applied to the whole Eastern Baltic.M√§gi 2018, pp. 144-145 The word Aesti mentioned by Tacitus might derive from Latin Aestuarii meaning \\"Estuary Dwellers\\".Theroux 2011, p. 22 Later geographically vague mentions include Aesti by Jordanes from the 6th century and Aisti by Einhard from the early 7th century. The last mention generally considered to be applying primarily to the southern parts of the Eastern-Baltic is Eastlanda in a description of Wulfstan‚Äôs travels from the 9th century.M√§gi 2018, pp. 145-146 In the following centuries, views of the Eastern Baltic became more complex, and in the 11th century, Adam of Bremen mentions three islands, with Aestland being the northernmost.M√§gi 2018, p. 148 The Scandinavian sagas referring to Eistland were the earliest sources to use the name in its modern meaning.Tvauri 2012, p. 31 The sagas were composed in the 13th century on the basis of earlier oral tradition by historians like Snorri Sturluson. Estonia appears as Aistland in Gutasaga and as Eistland in Ynglinga saga, √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar, Haralds saga h√°rfagra, and √ñrvar-Odds saga.Tvauri 2012, pp. 29-31 In Sweden, the Frug√•rden runestone from the 11th century mentions Estlatum \\"Estonian lands\\". The first mostly reliable chronicle data comes from Gesta Danorum by the 12th century historian Saxo Grammaticus, referring to Estonia as Hestia, Estia and its people as Estonum.Tvauri 2012, pp. 31-32Kasik 2011, p. 12 The toponym Estland/Eistland has been connected to Old Norse eist, austr meaning \\"the east\\".M√§gi 2018, p. 144 The 12th century Arab geographer al-Idrisi from Sicily, who presumably had help of some informant at Jutland in Denmark, describes AstalƒÅnda, probably referring to Estonia and the Livonian regions of Latvia.M√§gi 2018, p. 151 From Scandinavian the name spread to German and later, following the rise of the Catholic Church, reached Latin, with Henry of Latvia in his Heinrici Cronicon Lyvoniae (ca. 1229 AD) naming the region Estonia and its inhabitants Estones.R√§tsep 2007, p. 11Tamm, Kaljundi & Jensen 2016, pp. 94-96 =Adoption by Estonians= Perno Postimees in 1857 welcomed readers with \\"Terre, armas Eesti rahwas!\\" meaning \\"Hello, dear Estonian people!\\". The endonym maarahvas, literally meaning \\"land people\\" or \\"country folk\\", was used up until the mid-19th century.Beyer 2011, pp. 12-13 Its origins are unclear; there is a hypothesis of it originating from the prehistoric period, but no supporting evidence has been found. Another proposed explanation relates to its being a medieval loan-translation from German Landvolk.Paatsi 2012, pp. 2-3 Although the name had been used earlier, Johann Voldemar Jannsen played a major role in popularisation of Eesti rahvas \\"Estonian people\\" among the Estonians themselves, during the Estonian national awakening.Paatsi 2012, pp. 20-21 The first number of his newspaper Perno Postimees in 1857 started with \\"Terre, armas Eesti rahwas!\\" meaning \\"Hello, dear Estonian people!\\".Paatsi 2012, p. 1 In other languages Esthonia was a common alternative English spelling. In 1922, in response to a letter by Estonian diplomat Oskar Kallas raising the issue, the Royal Geographical Society agreed that the correct spelling was Estonia. Formal adoption took place at the government level only in 1926, with the United Kingdom and United States then adopting the spelling Estonia. In the same year this spelling was officially endorsed by the Estonian government, alongside Estonie in French, and Estland in German, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, and Swedish.Loit 2008, pp. 144-146 In Finnish Estonia is known as Viro, originating from the historic independent county Virumaa.

The peak is located to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, east-northeast of Mount Shuksan. It is the 21st highest peak in the state, with a height of and a prominence of . Redoubt is in the Skagit Range, a sub-range of the North Cascades, in the Custer-Chilliwack Group which includes Mount Spickard, Mount Redoubt, Mount Custer and Mox Peaks, among others. Redoubt, Bear, and Depot creeks drain off the mountain, which is composed of Skagit gneiss. Mount Redoubt is listed as one of the \\"Classic Eight Peaks\\" in the North Cascades. The mountain lies within the Stephen Mather Wilderness of North Cascades National Park, in remote terrain far from human settlement and difficult to access. It was first climbed in 1930, by Jimmy Cherry and Bob Ross. The nearest higher peak is Mount Spickard, (), which is to the east-northeast. Spickard's prominence is much greater than Redoubt's. The Redoubt Glacier lies on the eastern slopes of the peak and smaller unnamed glaciers lie to the north. There is a smaller mountain northwest of Mount Redoubt called Nodoubt Peak, whose name is a play on the larger mountain's name. Nodoubt Peak was named by a group of geologists who climbed the peak in 1967. Climate Mount Redoubt is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.Mount Redoubt at sunset As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Mt. Redoubt from Copper Ridge The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Other weapons of Vishnu include the Sudarshana Chakra, the Narayanastra, the Vaishnavastra, the Kaumodaki mace, Nandaka sword. In South India, (Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala) Sharanga is also called as Kodanda. In poems written by Bhadrachala Ramadasu, the poet used words like Kodandapani to refer to Lord Rama. Even Mirabai referred to Lord Krishna as Kodandadhari. This bow was crafted by Viswakarma, the Cosmic architect and maker of weapons, along with the Pinaka, the bow of Lord Shiva. Once, Brahma wanted to know who was a better archer, Vishnu or Shiva. Brahma created a quarrel between the two, which led to a terrible duel. The impact of their fight was such that the balance of the entire universe was disturbed. Lord Vishnu won the duel and rendered Pinaka immovable just by uttering 'hum'. http://redzambala.com/ramayana-valmiki/ramayana-bala-kanda- chapter-75.htmlhttp://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/2219/why-did-lord- shiva-fight-with-lord-vishnu Lord Shiva gave his Pinaka bow to a king, who was an ancestor of King Janaka, the father of Sita and Lord Vishnu too decided to do the same, and gave his bow to the Sage Richika. In time, Sharanga came into the possession of Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu and Richika's grandson.  Ramayana  Lord Rama is 7th incarnation of Lord Vishnu. During Sita's Swayamvar, Lord Rama lifts the Pinaka - the divine bow of Lord Shiva as per the contest conditions. Lord Rama tried to tie the string of Pinaka and use it but in the process broke it. Sage Parashurama comes to the place once he notices the same. Parashurama challenges Lord Rama to hold Sharanga if he could. Lord Rama lifts it easily. In some versions, it is also said that Parashurama loses his power, obtained as incarnation of Lord Vishnu, to Lord Rama as he hands over Sharanga to Lord Rama. It is also said that Lord Rama appeared as Lord Vishnu for Parashurama after holding Sharanga. Parashurama immediately blessed Lord Rama and suggested him to use Sharanga as his bow throughout his life. Lord Rama politely obeyed Parashurama's words. Lord Rama fought many battles with this celestial and divine bow only. The fierce Rama- Ravana battle was also fought with Lord Rama having Sharanga. Lord Rama killed many mighty warriors like Ravana, Kumbhakarna using this Sharanga. At the time of Ascension; Lord Rama gave this to God Varuna, the lord of the hydrosphere.https://detechter.com/powerful-weapons-of-lord-vishnu-and-his- avatars/  Mahabharata  Lord Krishna is 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Agni (God of fire) suffered from a digestive problem because of intake of lot of ghee from the yagnas performed by many people. He approached Lord Brahma for help. Lord Brahma told him to burn entire forest of Khandava to clear the problem and satisfy hunger. Soon Lord Agni came to know that Takshaka, the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of Indra's. Indra also promised that he would be on Takshaka side to save the forest. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met Agni. Agni explained the situation and Lord Krishna promised Agni that he and Arjuna would be on Agni's side. Arjuna told Agni that he and Lord Krishna need some celestial bows and weapons to fight with divine warriors like Lord Indra. Agni told them that he could present weapons with help of Varuna. Then Arjuna obtained celestial bow Gandiva and Akshaya tunira. And Lord Krishna got Sudarshana Chakra and Sharanga during the Khandava-dahana. In this war Lord Krishna fought with rest of the gods and Arjuna fought with Lord Indra. Lord Krishna and Arjuna won the war. From that moment Lord Krishna used this Sharanga as his bow. In Krishna-Arjuna war also Lord Krishna used Sharanga. That's the reason why neither Lord Krishna nor Arjuna gained the upper hand in the war.

They argued that the Secretary's office had accepted signatures provided by people who were not registered to vote or gathered by people who did not sign their signature sheets, and that the petitions were thus invalid.

Phyllis set sail from Gravesend, England, in August 1795 en route to Quebec with a detachment of soldiers and their families, under the command of Lt. (later General Sir) Howard Douglas. The ship ran aground in October 1795 just off a rocky beach, but the seas were so rough that several attempts to make it ashore resulted in the death of the swimmers. During the first day and night following the wreck, all of the children and all but one of the women on board were swept from the deck by the waves and drowned. The next day, a raft was built with a rope was secured to the bow and taken ashore, and the survivors made it off the ship just before she sank. The lone remaining woman died the next morning. Some provisions washed ashore, but the sailors refused to follow the orders of their captain and attempted to horde them. Douglas managed to maintain control over his men, and they marched inland in an attempt to find a settlement, but after a few days had to return to the beach. Several days later, on the brink of starvation and freezing to death, the survivors were rescued by a small schooner and taken to the fishing village of Great Jervis, where they spent the winter. Immediately upon arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia in April, 1796, Lt. Douglas was invited to dinner by Prince Edward, to whom he related the story of the shipwreck and rescue.

The trailer is meant to be paired with a compatibly designed tractor unit leading to greater fuel efficiency of the tractor-trailer combination. As such, the \\"teardrop\\" phrase refers to the entire combination, not just the trailer. The curved shape of the roof decreases aerodynamic drag by smoothing airflow over the top, thus improving fuel efficiency. One operator has reported the trailers save 2% in fuel in service that included significant low speed delivery operation and 5% in higher speed long-haul operation. Another factor improving airflow is the gap between the tractor and trailer is minimized to lessen the amount of turbulence created by air flowing into the gap. Teardrop trailers are only available in the United Kingdom and manufactured by one company, Don-Bur Trailers & Bodies Ltd which has patented the design. The manufacturer claims they can save 11.3% in fuel. The design echos streamlined shapes used in submarines, automobiles and camping trailers. The first streamlined car was the Tropfenwagen introduced in 1921, named after its teardrop shape (the literal translation from German is \\"drop car\\"). A study of trucking fleets in North American found that improving trailer aerodynamics was the least used method for improving fuel efficiency. Improving tractor aerodynamics and using low rolling resistance tires were adopted at much higher rates. Adoption The trailers have been used in the United Kingdom for several years by various operators. Deutsche Post DHL operates over 1,100 in the UK and was the first operator in continental Europe; it announced in 2014 that it would utilize the trailers in France and Germany.

It is placed in its own tribe Nardeae within the subfamily Pooideae. The name derives from ' (), the ancient Greek name for this plant. It is not to be confused with spikenard, Nardostachys jatamansi. Distribution and ecology Nardus stricta is native to Eurasia (from Iceland and the Azores to Mongolia), North Africa (Algeria, Morocco), and northeastern North America (Greenland, eastern Canada, and the northeastern United States). Nardus stricta occurs on heath, moorland, hills, and mountains on nutrient poor acidic sandy to peaty soils and is strongly calcifuge, avoiding calcareous soils. It can occur from low elevations to over , becoming a community-dominant in late snow patches on mountains. Nardus stricta may also become a dominant species in habitats grazed by cattle or sheep because it is tough and unpalatable. It flowers from June until August. Apomixis is found to be common in this plant, with extensive colonies often proving to be a single clone. Description Culms are erect and long, with grey-green leaf-blades filiform and involute, ranging from long by wide, i.e. bristle like. The ligules of basal leaves are long and blunt, while those of culm leaves are longer, up to , and more pointed.

A 60-metre (197 ft) wind-monitoring mast was installed in March 2006 in order to accurately measure wind speed and direction in the area.Coopers Gap Wind Farm . Windlab Systems.  Site  The location for the wind farm is a hilly area to the west of the Bunya Mountains. The site area lies to the north and south of Niagara Road, starting approximately 3 km (2 miles) from the Bunya Highway, as well as to the west of Jarail Road. The site extends to Crowles Road to the south, Cooranga North-Niagara Road to the west, close to Nords Road and Diamondy Road to the North and close to Bunya Highway to the east. The area is mostly cleared, cattle-grazing country and covers approximately in total. The project falls within both the South Burnett Regional Council and Western Downs Regional Council jurisdictions.  Project  Coopers Gap Wind Farm is the largest in Australia with a total generation capacity of up to and annually, 1.51 million megawatt hours of energy. The wind farm consists of 123 turbines extending across a series of ridge lines within the site. The wind turbines are approximately in height from the tower base to the tip of the blade.Coopers Gap Wind Farm Information Brochure. Windlab Systems. The tower will be approximately high, and the blades approximately in length with a rotor diameter of . The construction costs of the project were initially to be over $1.2 billion. However the project was revised to include 115 turbines and only cost A$800 million. The electricity generated from each turbine is transmitted via underground or above ground cabling to a central cable marshalling point at the on site substation, which is located next to the 220 kV or 132 kV power lines that run through the site area. The sub station then connects directly into the grid network on site. It is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 2.2 million tonnes annually. In April 2011, some local landholders expressed concerns at a community forum related to health effects and the noise of the wind turbines, some of which will be less than a kilometre from homes. In March 2017, the project was approved by the Coordinator-General. The approved project consists of up to 115 turbines, with a maximum tip height of 180m, and a maximum rotor diameter of 140m. The first turbine generated electricity to the grid on 24 June 2019. An emergency services drill was conducted involving someone having broken into the tower and occupied the turbine and threatening further harm to themselves and the equipment.

The Bogie river Hills subregion has a total area of approximately 9000 sq. kilometres and is oriented along a north-west - south-east axis. It is bounded by the eastern margin of the Bowen Basin (Millaroo fault zone) in the west, the ranges that descend to the Proserpine coastal lowlands in the east, Burdekin River delta and the coastal plains in the north, and to the south-east, it runs down towards the Eungella Dam. A portion of the alluvial plain of the lower Burdekin River is located in the north and north west of the subregion. Smaller alluvial plains are located on the Bowen and Bogie rivers which flow through the subregion into the Burdekin River. The Don River which flows into the sea near Bowen has an alluvial plain and a small delta. To the north of the Don River is a narrow coastal plain across which several small coastal streams flow, this is analogous to but smaller than the Townsville coastal plain to the north. To the south the Lizzie Creek Volcanics, which are largely basic volcaniclastic rocks with interbedded sedimentary rocks have produced distinct landforms, soils and vegetation communities. This area is essentially lowlands with a few isolated peaks. It consists of the lower drainage basins of the Bogie, Bowen, and Broken rivers, and several smaller streams. Elevation is between 50 and 200 metres. The remainder of the subregion is largely mountainous, hilly and undulating land on acid to intermediate igneous rocks. This area contains a number of prominent mountains including Mount Abbot, Edinburgh Castle, Mount Aberdeen, Highlanders Bonnet. Elevation ranges from about 200 metres to over 100 metres. The Bogie River Hills has a mean annual rainfall of 700 mm, but actual rainfall tends to be higher in the east where the main mountain ranges occur, and lower towards the south-west. There is marked rain shadow on the western side of the Clarke, Normanby, and Broken River ranges, which has resulted in one of the steepest rainfall gradients in Australia. Drainage of the subregion is largely into the Bogie River/Bowen River/Burdekin River system and then into the Townsville Plains bioregion, through the Burdekin delta, and then out to sea. Drainage is also partly toward Bowen via the Don River, and towards Proserpine via the upper Proserpine and Andromache rivers. The Peter Faust Dam and Eungella Dam are located within this subregion. The main settlements in this subregion are Bowen, with Collinsville/Scottsdale immediately outside the central-western part of the subregion boundary. Coal mining is a major industry at Collinsville, and a dedicated railway line runs from there to a coal loading facility at Abbot Point. There Bowen Developmental Road is the sealed road between Bowen and Collinsville which then continues southward. The Bruce Highway passes through the coastal area in the north-east. Other roads are gravel, with low-level concrete stream crossings. See also *Regions of Queensland References IBRA Version 6.1 data. (Search in \\"Title\\" for \\"IBRA\\").

After AW was cancelled, the character crossed over to the CBS daytime soap opera As the World Turns for guest appearances between 2000 and 2003. Storylines Marley was born into the wealthy Love family and led a privileged life. Despite her upbringing, Marley was kind, modest, and shy. Neither did Marley know she had an identical twin sister Vicky Hudson and their biological parents were teenage sweethearts Michael Hudson and Donna Love. Vicky was given up for adoption while Marley grew up believing Donna's parents, Reginald and Elizabeth, were her parents and Donna was her sister. When she was very young, Elizabeth died and Reginald faked his death, leaving her to be raised by her \\"older siblings.\\" Peter Love was the first Love family member to arrive in Bay City. He was later joined by sisters Donna and Nicole. Marley joined them later on, returning from boarding school in Switzerland. She later finished her education at Bay City High School. Marley got the shock of her life when a girl named Vicky Carson, who looked exactly like her, blew into town. The truth then came out that Donna was their mother and had no idea that she had given birth to twins. It turned out Reginald had stolen Vicky and given her up for adoption. Vicky had come to town to swindle the Loves along with her best friend, Jake McKinnon. Jake was supposed to pretend to fall in love with Marley, but then he actually fell in love with her. Vicky and Jake had had a casual sexual relationship and Vicky realized that she wanted more than friendship from Jake. Jake did not feel the same way and this strained Marley and Vicky's relationship. Marley was diagnosed with leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant, so Vicky donated hers to her ailing sister. After Vicky's recovery, the twins developed a strong bond, though there was always some tension beneath the surface. Marley and Vicky met their biological father Michael and they became very close, with both Marley and Vicky taking his name. Marley and Jake married and left town. Marley returned to town after she found out Jake was cheating on her. Jake had been hoping to reconcile, but him and Marley could not work things out. Jake and Vicky impulsively slept together one night. Vicky became pregnant and claimed the baby belonged to Jamie Frame (Laurence Lau). Jamie and Vicky married, while Marley and Jake managed to reunite. Marley was thrilled to become an aunt when Vicky's son Steven was born. Everybody's happiness was short-lived when Jamie found out the truth about Jake and Vicky's one-night-stand. Jake and Marley formed a united front and decided to fight for full custody of Vicky's son, Steven. When a DNA test proved Jamie was in fact Steven's father, Marley and Jake were devastated. The damage done to their marriage was irreparable and Jake and Marley divorced. Marley left town to travel around Europe. Marley returned to town and grew close with Jake again. While on vacation in Nice, France, she ran into Jamie, who was now divorced from Vicky. They ended up falling in love, but Marley still felt she should be with Jake. When Jake proposed to her, Marley accepted. Unbeknownst to Marley, Jake had slept with Donna months earlier and was cheating on her with Paulina Cantrell. Marley discovered Jake's affair with Paulina and broke off their engagement. Jake became enraged and raped her. After the rape, Marley returned home where Vicky questioned why she was so distraught. Marley lied and told Vicky that Jake had only tried to rape her. When Vicky went to confront Jake at his TV studio, she found him shot. Jake survived, but Marley became one of the prime suspects in his shooting. A witness came forward and claimed he had seen Marley leave Jake's studio around the time he was shot and Marley was arrested and charged with attempted murder. Cass Winthrop became her attorney and she confided in him about the rape. Marley panicked before the start of the trial and left town. To keep her sister out of trouble, Vicky took her place in court. Marley eventually returned to face the music. Though he promised he wouldn't, Cass made Marley confess on the stand that Jake had raped her. The whole courtroom was stunned and it caused Donna to confess to the murder, though she too was innocent (Paulina was the perpetrator). In her fake confession, Donna admitted she had slept with Jake and Marley turned her back on her mother. Marley's whole life had fallen apart, but Jamie helped her through it. They became engaged and began planning a family. Jake still wanted Marley, but Marley made it clear she wanted nothing to do with him. Jake continued to run interference in her relationship with Jamie, but they managed to survive his sabotage. Marley had discovered it would be difficult for her to become pregnant and she sought out treatment. She was determined to give Jamie another child, but her treatments were not working. Dennis Wheeler, Jamie's best friend and step- nephew, returned to town and an attraction grew between him and Marley. The strain of her infertility issues, not to mention her closeness with Dennis, ended her relationship with Jamie. Marley was reluctant to jump into another relationship and held off on dating Dennis. Olivia Matthews came to Marley with an offer to adopt the baby she was carrying. Marley was thrilled to finally get the chance be a mother. Then she found out Dennis was the father. This complicated matters between them, but they both tried to be there for Olivia. Olivia changed her mind about the adoption and left town to give birth. Marley and Dennis had now both lost a baby. Marley briefly dated Byron Pierce, who pushed her and Dennis together when he saw they had feelings for each other. Dennis and Marley realized they should be together and began officially dating. They were happy for a time, but it became clear neither of them wanted anything too serious. Marley realized she and Dennis were not meant to be and broke up with him. Dennis subsequently left town. Marley continued to be the shoulder to cry on for her friends and family, particularly her sister. Marley eventually moved to San Francisco for a new life. She appeared for Vicky's wedding to Jake, where she gave them her blessing. She also came back for Michael's funeral. Marley returned to live in Bay City full-time. She had a terrible accident and was badly burned. Vicky and Jake helped her through it and Jake and Marley were finally able to put the past behind them. Marley believed her and Jake were meant to be together and decided to get her sister out of the way. She kidnapped Vicky and made everyone believe she had died. Jake felt something was not right about Vicky's \\"death\\" and decided to find out what Marley was up to. He discovered Vicky was alive and Marley was sent to a mental institution. When Marley was released, Vicky forgave her and asked her to move in. Jake was furious and moved out. He later reconciled with Vicky, and came around to forgiving Marley. Marley met lawyer Tyrone Montgomery and they began dating.

His reign is chiefly remembered for Venice's dispute with the papacy, which resulted in Pope Paul V placing a papal interdict on Venice 1606‚Äì1607. Background, 1536‚Äì1606 The son of Giovanni Battista Donato and Giovanna Corner, Donato was born into a merchant family. Through his shrewd business sense, he was able to turn his family's average amount of wealth into a fortune. His wealth established, Donato began a public career in Venice, serving in turn as the Venetian ambassador to Constantinople, podest√† of Venice, and as governor and Procurator of St Mark's. Donato later served as the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican and lived at Rome for many years. His opposition to the ambitions of the papacy led him to conflict with Cardinal Borghese, the future Pope Paul V. Donato's staunchly anti-papal stance led to rumours that he was secretly a Protestant, although historians have not found any evidence of this. Reign as Doge, 1606‚Äì1612 Donato became one of the candidates for Doge upon the death of Marino Grimani on December 25, 1605. Donato faced two opponents in this election (including Marcantonio Memmo, who would eventually succeed him as Doge), but ultimately received both of their support, resulting in his election as Doge on January 10, 1606. Donato inherited a conflict with the papacy from Grimani: Between 1601 and 1604, Venice, under Grimani's leadership, had passed a number of laws limiting the power of the papacy within the Republic of Venice and withdrawing a number of clerical privileges. This came to a head in late 1605 when Venice charged two priests as common criminals, thus denying their clerical immunity from facing charges in secular courts. On December 10, 1605, two weeks before Grimani's death, Pope Paul V sent a formal protest to Venice. Shortly after his election as Doge, Donato, at the urging of Paolo Sarpi, rejected Paul V's protest. As a result, in April 1606, Paul V issued a papal interdict on Venice, thus excommunicating the entire Venetian population. At Sarpi's urging, Donato ordered all Roman Catholic clergy to ignore the Pope's interdict and continue to perform the mass, on pain of immediate expulsion from the Venetian Republic. The Venetian clergy all continued to perform mass, except for the Jesuits, who left the Republic (or were expelled depending on one's perspective) rather than violate the papal interdict. The Jesuits would not return to Venice until 1655. Donato and Sarpi were also personally excommunicated by Paul V. 19th-century painting depicting Galileo Galilei displaying his telescope to Leonardo Donato in 1609. The Kingdom of France acted as a mediator in the dispute between Venice and the papacy. On April 21, 1607, a deal was reached under which the two priests that Venice had charged as common criminals would be handed over to French custody, and, in exchange, the pope would remove the interdict against Venice. The remainder of Donato's reign as Doge is largely without note. Donato was not at all popular with the Venetian crowd, so, after his first year as Doge, Donato significantly restricted his public appearances as Doge. Many rumours circulated about the reclusive Donato during these years, but none were ever substantiated. He died on July 16, 1612.

He was a member of the House of Lords from 1985 until his retirement in 2018. Sanderson was educated at St. Mary's School, Melrose, Glenalmond College, Bradford Technical College and the Scottish Textile College. Knighted in 1981, Sanderson was created a life peer on 5 June 1985 as Baron Sanderson of Bowden, of Melrose in the District of Ettrick and Lauderdale and spoke regularly in the House of Lords. Bowden in his title is taken from a village in the Roxburghshire area of the Scottish Borders. From 1987 to 1990 Lord Sanderson was a Minister of State in the Scottish Office, responsible for housing, agriculture and fisheries. He also served as Chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland in the early 1990s, and was seen as responsible for removing Michael Forsyth from the Scottish Office and other right-wingers from the Party's Central Office in Scotland. In 2010 he was appointed to lead a review into the future of the Conservative Party in Scotland. This followed the 2010 United Kingdom general election, where despite winning a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, the Conservatives won only one constituency in Scotland. Lord Sanderson's report recommended an overhaul of leadership, with a separately elected leader to take full responsibility of the party's performance in Scotland. A formal response from the party was expected in early 2011. He retired from the House of Lords on 29 March 2018.

History  According to the historical annals, during the latter half of the 19th century a Burgher national named Brohier had taken the initiative to start a private School in rented bungalow located in close proximity to Holy Cross Church. In the year 1890, the parish priest of Kalamulla, Kalutara, Rev. Father Wilkinson, who was the first rector baptized this private Institution of Education as Holy Cross English School. Later it was registered as Holy Cross Upper English School by Rev. Father Leo Fernando the founder principal of the present Holy Cross College, who succeeded Rev. Fr. Wilkinson. Father Leo Fernando, through great effort obtained the assistance of the government for Holy Cross College to function as a semi government school. Rev. Fr. M. Herel who hailed from Nancy, France became the rector of Holy Cross College for a period of 7 years since 1905. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Robert Fernando who was responsible for introducing numerous innovative features to Holy Cross College. One of the striking achievements during his period was that a pupil of the college emerged as the First on obtaining the best results out of all the entire Common Wealth Countries, in the Cambridge Examination. Rev. Fr. F.L.Breton assumed duties as the Principal for a period of 3 years from 1918‚Äì1921 during his tenure of office it was Rev. Father Briton who introduced the Cadet Platoon to Holy Cross College. Rev. Father Breton was succeeded by Rev. Fr. C.V. Croos who served Holy Cross College for 9 years since 1921. During this period he was successful in expanding the buildings by adding a Science Laboratory and another building to the college. In addition, Holy Cross College was upgraded as a Secondary School during the period. Rev. Fr. Gaston Chaulieu a French national happened to be the only Principal of Holy Cross College to serve an unbroken period of 16 years from 1930 to 1946. This era was considered by many as the Golden Era of the Holy Cross College which could be proud of its unique achievements. Construction of new buildings, conducting Inter House Athletic Events and dividing the college into a Girls‚Äô School and a Boys' School were some of the highlights of this era. Students offered both London Matriculation and Chamber of Commerce Examinations. British Governor Sir Edward Stubbs graced the Annual Prize Giving Celebrations of Holy Cross College (1935‚Äì36) as the Chief Guest was one of the striking events of this period. Rev.Fr.Arthur M. Fernando became the first Director of Holy Cross College (1945‚Äì1948). During this period, the number of student population was on the increase over 1000 and for the first time students offered University Entrance Examination. Within his administration, in 1947 the college was promoted to one of the First Grade Schools of the Island. Rev.Fr.Benedict J.C. Pinto (1948‚Äì1954): Holding of the National Independence Day Celebrations of Kalutara District Schools on the Grounds of Holy Cross College could be cited as an important and colourful event participated by an unprecedented gathering of distinguished visitors. The First Prime Minister of Independent Sri Lanka, Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake was present to grace the occasion as the Chief Guest. First Governor General of Independent Sri Lanka, Lord Soulbury was the Chief Guest on Golden Jubilee Prize Giving Day Celebrations held in Holy Cross College. In addition Cadet Troop of the college could win the coveted Herman Loos Trophy meant for the Island's Best School Cadet Troop. In 1948 College Drama Troupe won the Shakespeare Trophy in the Inter School Shakespeare English Drama Competition organized by Ceylon Thespians. Radio Ceylon (as SLBC was known then) organized All Island Inter School English Speech Contest and the participant pupils of Holy Cross College, won the First Place in both Junior and Senior contests. Rev. Fr. Theodor E. Pieris (1954‚Äì1970) During this period the government was engaged in taking over of Schools; Holy Cross College was allowed to function as a non-fee levying Private School. Banning of Cadet Platoon and the termination of State grants were some of the crises encountered by the college during this period. Rev. Fr. Themothy Pieris (1970‚Äì1973) During this period, Holy Cross College won the Gold Medals as the winners in both Senior and Junior Contests in the All Island English Speech Contests organized by the Department of Education. Mr. M.J. Anthony Cooray (1973‚Äì1978): For the first time in the history of Holy Cross College, Mr. Anthony Cooray happened to be its first lay Principal. During his period the Old Boy's Association Holy Cross College could be reorganized. Every Institution has to encounter both vibrant and dormant periods on its forward march and Holy Cross College was not an exception. Due to unavoidable circumstances Holy Cross College had to maintain a low profile for a brief period until the arrival of the Congregation of Marist Brothers for its rescue. On the invitation of Archbishop of Colombo, since 1978 Marist Brothers took over the administration of Holy Cross College. Speedy resurgence of every facet of Holy Cross College could be witnessed under the dedicated Marist Brothers. In order to cater to the growing demand of the parents for admissions, the Marist Brothers had to face the onerous task of providing more and more buildings and the development of infrastructure of the college. Rev. Brother. E. Francis Silva: (1978‚Äì1987) During the vicissitude experienced by the Holy Cross College in its dark era, a great endeavour was made by Rev. Brother Francis Silva to revive the activities of the Holy Cross College. Sports Section of the college was revitalized. In 1980 the teachers‚Äô salaries were paid by the government. As a direct result of the maintenance of good public relations, Rev. Brother Francis Silva could obtain the cooperation of the Old Boys‚Äô Association on the forward march of Holy Cross College. An annual friendly cricket encounter named \\"Battle of the Lagoons\\" was started in 1979 against Maris Stella College, Negombo. This brought unity among the students in an unprecedented scale. Inaugural match was held in Kalutara. Jagath Santha Fernando led HCC team at the inaugural match, which ended up in a draw. Holy Cross won the second encounter, which was held in Negombo and the victorious team was led by Darmapriya Vidanapathirana (team members: Lasantha Mudalige, Janaka Gunawardena, Jagath Santha Fernando, Lasantha Gomez, Shiromal Fernando, Thilak Sudaksheen, Joseph Guneratne, Lalith Samarasinghe, Sisira Ratnayake, Richard Wijesekara, ). Rev. Brother Clinton Perera: (1988‚Äì2000) Expansion of the college play ground, and the construction of four storied building and foundation laying for a five storied building took place during his tenure of office. In addition, the expansion of Laboratory and Library facilities also took place. Rev. Brother Lal Fonseka: (2000‚Äì2004) during his period, the infrastructure development activities launched by Rev. Brother Clinton Perera was continued. He was well focused in improving academic standards of the college and he achieved his goal by having 80% pass rate in GCE A/L examination. Not only pass rate but also university admission rate among the college graduates was around 30%-40% during his time period. Rev. Brother Ranjith Perera: (2004‚Äì2009) amidst numerous financial constraints faced by the college Principal and Director of Holy Cross College Rev. Brother. Ranjith Perera has been successful in completing this high profiled auditorium facility of the college. Very.Rev.Fr Emmanuel Fernando: was the Rector for an interim period of four months which after college was taken from Marist Brothers. Rev.Dr.Camillus Fernando: (2010‚Äì2015) Since his installation as the rector of the college he has been instrumental in developing English as the medium of college activities, which was initiated by Rev. Brother Lal Fonseka and Rev. Brother Ranjith Perera. Rev.Fr.Carlton De Silva's: (2015-..)

During his spell at Fulham, he helped them claim the Football League Second Division championship title in 1949.  Football career  McDonald was born in Maltby, West Riding of Yorkshire and joined Wolverhampton Wanderers as a trainee in May 1937, aged 15. Shortly after his 17th birthday, in September 1938, he signed professional papers before going on to make two appearances for \\"Wolves\\" in the First Division. In May 1939, McDonald was transferred to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, but the Second World War broke out and normal football was suspended before he made his debut. During the war, he made guest appearances for a whole host of clubs, including Bristol City, Cardiff City, Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion, York City and Southampton. At the end of the war, he returned to Bournemouth and soon made a name for himself as a goal-scoring left-winger, scoring 36 goals in 80 appearances in the Football League Third Division South. In 1948, Bournemouth finished as runners-up, but missed out on the only promotion spot available. (It was to be nearly 40 years before the \\"Cherries\\" eventually reached the Second Division.) McDonald's form soon attracted the attention of bigger teams, and in June 1948 he moved to London to join Fulham for a fee of ¬£12,000. At the time of his transfer, Fulham's manager Jack Peart commented in the club's year book: > \\"For the present season 1948‚Äì9, we have made a few additions to our playing > staff. No doubt chief interest will be focused on Jack McDonald, whose > transfer we have secured from the Bournemouth and Boscombe Club in spite of > very strong competition. I am certain Jack will prove a great acquisition.\\" McDonald only missed one match in the 1948‚Äì49 season, scoring nine goals. His crosses assisted the other forwards, including Arthur Rowley, who scored 19, and Bob Thomas, who was top scorer with 23, as the club claimed the Football League Second Division championship title by one point ahead of West Bromwich Albion and long-time leaders, Southampton. In the First Division, McDonald's form was not so prolific and he eventually lost his place to Northern Ireland international Johnny Campbell, making only five appearances in each of the 1950‚Äì51 and 1951‚Äì52 seasons. In August 1952, he was signed by Southampton as a replacement for Tom Lowder who was out with appendicitis. McDonald made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in the opening match of the 1952‚Äì53 season and scored four goals in the first eight matches, before a sudden loss of form led to the recall of Lowder following his return to health. In a match against Bury at The Dell on 20 September, McDonald took a penalty; the first attempt was kicked straight at Jimmy Kirk in the Bury goal and he then lofted the rebound over the bar. McDonald spent most of the rest of the season relegated to the reserves, although he was tried at centre-forward for four matches near the end of the season, with no conspicuous success. In the summer of 1953, McDonald was transfer-listed and sold to Southend United for a fee of ¬£800. The following year, he retired from league football, and returned to live in Bournemouth where he obtained employment as a P.E. teacher. Whilst playing for Weymouth, then in the Southern League, McDonald returned to The Dell in December 1956 for an FA Cup match ‚Äì his team put up a gallant fight, only going down 3‚Äì2, with Southampton's Jimmy Shields being sent off following a foul on the Weymouth goalkeeper. (This match was the first time Cup football had been played at the Dell under floodlights.)  Later career  McDonald subsequently moved to Elgin in Scotland before returning to England to live in retirement on the Isle of Wight.

While most other types of angiography cannot produce images of vessels smaller than 200 ¬µm in diameter, microangiography does just that. A microangiographic image is the result of injection of a contrast medium into either the blood or the lymphatic system and, then, enlargement of the resulting radiograph. Thus, an image is obtained in which there is contrast between vessel and surrounding tissue. It is often used in order to detect microvascular lesions in organs. But, it has been suggested that microangiography can also be used to detect tumors through visualization of tumor-induced small blood vessels. This is because tumor growths require vascularization before they can develop more rapidly. A few of the commonly used types are fluorescent, silicone rubber, and synchrotron radiation microangiography. Common types =Fluorescent microangiography= Also known as FMA, fluorescent microangiography is used to visualize and quantify changes in microvasculature. It is different from other types of microangiography in that a fluorescent marker or contrast medium is used instead of something else. Fluorescein and indocyanine green are often used for this purpose. =Laser Doppler holography= Laser Doppler imaging by digital holography reveals retinal blood flow non invasively in the eye fundus Puyo, L√©o, Michel Paques, Mathias Fink, Jos√©-Alain Sahel, and Michael Atlan. \\"Choroidal vasculature imaging with laser Doppler holography.\\" Biomedical optics express 10, no. 2 (2019): 995-1012..

Laser Doppler imaging by holography provides high-contrast visualization of local blood flow in choroidal vessels in humans, with a spatial resolution comparable to state-of- the-art indocyanine green angiography. =Silicone rubber microangiography= This type of microangiography produces a three-dimensional image that depicts the distribution of vasculature in a tissue. It is commonly used to determine changes in microvasculature. =Synchrotron radiation microangiography= This type of microangiography uses monochromatic synchrotron radiation and a high- definition video system to provide an image of small collateral arteries with a diameter less than 100 ¬µm.

When exposed to stress conditions such as temperature, pH, mechanical or osmotic stress, the cell can switch into a filamentous growth form (also see hyphae). = Genome = The genome of Y. lipolytica consists of around 20,5 Mbp (mega base pairs), encodes for over 7000 genes and is distributed on six chromosomes (named A to F) and the mitochondrial DNA (M). Naturally, there are small differences in the length of the genomes of different strain isolates. Usually hemiascomycetous yeast have a low number of introns, however, Y. lipolytica is an exception with about 15% of genes containing introns.

The results showed that the number of the enlarged pores and blackheads on the volunteer's faces were significantly reduced more than 15.66 and 21.84% respectively by using the essence, as compared to the number of enlarged and clogged pores on the untreated control faces. Also, the amount of sebum and keratin in faces were meaningfully reduced by 64.17% and 16.47%, respectively. They further demonstrated that the levels of skin brightness were improved after treatment of the reagent by 2.49%. Moreover, the number of comedones were decreased 9.59%.

Cheese knife The first type of skeleton knife is a small kitchen knife that typically has three large holes on its blade used for cutting fruit or cheese. The purpose of these holes is to reduce the surface area of the blade so that sticky foods do not cling to it. Most skeleton knives are used for cutting very soft foods. The knife was created by a Swiss restaurant and after its creation and advertisement it was stolen by many cutlery companies and private manufacturers, and is now widely manufactured by companies like Victorinox. Penknife The less commonly known type of skeleton knife is a penknife that was made without bolsters or handle material and sold to jewelers or other artisans for final finishing. These types of knives were mostly made in the 19th century and as late as 1950. Wostenholm of Sheffield, England made many of these knives as did Imperial Knife Co. in the United States. Jewelers would finish the knives' handles in semi precious stones and in some cases gold or other precious metals in their own style.

Vince (March 18, 1900 ‚Äì October 29, 1996) was an American football player for the Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Bulldogs, and the Cleveland Panthers. He later coached at Baldwin‚ÄìWallace College and John Carroll University. Outspoken and inventive as a coach, he was the inventor of the face mask. The original he created is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He also was the first coach to put an armband of plays on his quarterbacks' wrists, now a common sight in the game. He attended Washington & Jefferson College and played in the 1922 Rose Bowl. He is distinguished as being the first Italian to play in the National Football League (NFL). Early life and playing career Vince was an Italian immigrant who grew up working in the coal mines of southern Ohio. He watched his first football game as a senior at Martins Ferry High School. Realizing that a football scholarship was his ticket out of the coal mines and into college, he joined the varsity team. Ralph succeeded, and the next year, attended and played for Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. He played both offense and defense for the Presidents. In 1922, the team played the favored University of California to a scoreless tie in the Rose Bowl. On the 60th and 70th anniversaries of that game, Vince was an honored guest at the Rose Bowl. After graduating from Washington & Jefferson in 1922, Vince enrolled at Western Reserve University's Law School in Cleveland. In order to pay his way through law school, Vince played in the early National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Indians in 1923 and Cleveland Bulldogs in 1924 and 1925. Vince also played for the Cleveland Panthers in 1926, in the first American Football League (AFL). During this era of professional football, Vince was on the field against such names as Jim Thorpe, George Halas, Red Grange, and Fats Henry. Coaching career While in law school in Cleveland, Vince coached football for St. Ignatius High School beginning in 1923, coaching to the team to its first city championship in 1925. His football record from 1923 through 1926 was a combined 29‚Äì6 (.829), Ralph also coached St. Ignatius basketball team for the 1924‚Äì25 season. With his success at the high school level, John Carroll University recruited him to be their head football coach. Coaching seven seasons from 1927 through 1933, Vince achieved a collegiate coaching record of 31‚Äì23‚Äì11 (.562). Vince later served as the school's athletic director for two years. In 1935, Vince left John Carroll to practice law; however, he continued officiating at high school, college and NFL games. During World War II, he agreed to coach football at University School for one year; however, he stayed on with the school for an additional 12 years. Legal career and later years Vince was appointed as a Cleveland Municipal judge after leaving John Carroll. He also served for two years as a councilman and four years as a law director in University Heights. In the early 1950s, he presided over the lawsuits regarding the SS Noronic disaster. The SS Noronic was a passenger ship that was destroyed by fire in Toronto Harbour in September 1949 with serious loss of life. Vince heard 669 lawsuits filed by those who were injured or lost their relatives in the tragedy. Ralph retired as a senior partner of the Burke Haber Berick law firm in 1990.

Besides a solo career, he was the member of bands Bergendy and V'Moto-Rock, and played an important part in the pop culture of the country, contributing to nearly 150 albums. Career Ferenc Demj√©n was born on 21 December 1946 in Di√≥sgy≈ër. His father was an engineer at the Di√≥sgy≈ër Steel Company, and after he was fired because of political reasons, the family moved to Budapest, where he got a ministry job. Demj√©n, who graduated as a chemist technician, was inspired by his fathers singing talent, and started to study music, largely on his own. After starting as a bassist in bands Sz√°mum, Liversing, Dogs, Meteor, Sakk-Matt, T≈±zker√©k and Szabads√°g Sz√°ll√≥ Kulcs√°r, he met Istv√°n Bergendy in 1970, who invited him to play in his band. He debuted as a songwriter with J√∂jj vissza v√°ndor, scoring his first success, resulting in weekly performances in the popular E-Klub and Ifj√∫s√°gi Park. They gained country-wide popularity by performing in the National Television's show at New Year's Eve in 1970. Their first open concert was in 1971 in the Kisstadion stadium. In 1972 they won second place in the year's T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l with the song √ögy Szeretn√©m. Demj√©n left the band in 1977 and released his first solo album while forming the successful band V'Moto-Rock in the same year. He worked with Kl√°ri Katona and Kati Kov√°cs on their first albums. His song for the film Szerelem els≈ë v√©rig (1987) topped the Hungarian charts for 8 months. After V'Moto-Rock disbanded in 1988, Demj√©n began a solo career, releasing an album almost every year in the nineties. In 1988, while traveling in the US, he met Rebecca at the New York City HardRock Cafe. They began traveling together and soon married. He received the Order of the Hungarian Republic, Officer's rank in 1996.

It is a one-and-a-half story structure, partly built of logs and partly of wood framing, covered by a gabled roof and weatherboard siding. The eastern portion is built out of logs joined by dovetailed notches. A 1982 dendrochonological study of the logs used estimated the structure was likely originally built in 1850 and the style and methods used suggested the builders were of European descent. It is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the Clarksville and Johnson County region. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
