Muirhead is located approximately two miles from Gartcosh, Lenzie and Stepps railway stations. History The name may be related to the nearby Muirside. Some old documents show Muirhead with various spellings including maps by for example William Forrest. Muirhead was little more than a hamlet before a new road was built just south of Chryston at the end of the 18th century. Muirhead was formerly in the parish of Cadder. Industries connected with Muirhead include coal and fire clay mining, brickmaking and distilling. The New Statistical Account of 1845 reported 40 persons in 9 families at Muirhead. Growth in the village followed the opening of The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway in 1831. Following the First World War a cenotaph was built in 1923 at Muirhead. A primary school, St. Barbara's on Elmira Road, was opened in August 1933. Current Village The suburb has a variety of shops including a Co-operative Food, newsagents, award-winning butcher, stationers and plenty of take-away food shops.

Background Garibaldi at Dijon Garibaldi had led volunteer forces with great success during the unification of Italy, and had also fought in South America. He had a worldwide reputation as a liberal revolutionary. Most Italians including Garibaldi had supported Prussia against France in this war. However, after Napoleon III was defeated and the French Third Republic was proclaimed, and Bismarck demanded the cession of Alsace, Italian opinion reversed completely. This was best exemplified by the reaction of Garibaldi, who told the Movimento of Genoa on 7 September 1870 that \\"Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.\\" Subsequently, Garibaldi wrote a letter to the government of the new republic offering, “what is left of me.” The French were reluctant at first to accept his offer, \\"but help from such a distinguished source could not be rejected.\\"Howard, Michael. The Franco- Prussian War: The German Invasion of France, 1870-1871. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1962. p.254 Garibaldi arrived in Marseilles on November 7, 1870, to a cool reception. The French commanders were unsure of the wisdom in bringing on Garibaldi, as well as harboring old feelings of distrust, as they had been enemies until just a short time previously. Garibaldi was initially put in charge of a few hundred Italian volunteers, but after much arguing took command of 5,000-15,000 men. Organization The Army of the Vosges was a part of the French Third Republic Army that was made up primarily of volunteers. The volunteers included men from Poland, Italy, Ireland, England, Spain and America. The Army also included Frenchmen who were loyal to their country, but uninterested in the constraints that joining the regular army would have brought about. These men were often members of a francs-tireur, guerrilla forces that fought outside the scope of the regular army. The Army was organized into four brigades, “the first commanded by General Bossack, the second by Colonel Delpeck, … and the third by Menotti [Garibaldi, Giuseppe's son].” Garibaldi, Giuseppe. Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi Vol. II. Translated by A. Werner. New York: Howard Fertig, 1971. p.321 The fourth brigade was under the command of Ricciotti Garibaldi, another of Giuseppe’s sons. The chief of staff for the Army of the Vosges was General Bordone, the man largely responsible for Garibaldi going to France. Among other things, Bordone was in charge of procuring any supplies that the Army might need. Campaign The campaign started out impressively enough. On November 14, 1870, a small force led by Ricciotti Garibaldi surprised a Prussian force of one thousand men at Châtillon and won the day. Giuseppe issued an order of the day detailing this victory. > ::The francs-tireurs of the Vosges, the chasseurs of the Isère, the > (Savoyard) chasseurs of the Alps, the battalion of the Doubs, and the Hâvre > chasseurs, all of whom, under the direction of Ricciotti Garibaldi, have > taken part in the affair at Châtillon, have deserved well of the Republic. > ::Being only 400 strong, they attacked about 1000 men, defeated them, made > 167 prisoners (including 13 officers), and took eighty-two saddled horses, > four fourgons of arms and ammunition, and the mail waggon.(sic) On our side > there were six men killed, and twelve wounded; the enemy had more. ::I > commend the prisoners to the generosity of the French nation.Garibaldi, > Giuseppe. Autobiography of Giuseppe Garibaldi Vol. II. Translated by A. > Werner. New York: Howard Fertig, 1971. p.324 While this was great news to the army at large, it would prove to be a problem for Garibaldi’s men. With such an astonishing victory over a superior force, the army developed a false sense of security. For the rest of the Army of the Vosges, the campaign started a few days later in November 1870. The city of Dijon was under siege by the Prussian army, so Garibaldi and his men set out for Dijon, intent on helping the citizens defend their city. A few miles from the city, the army received word that the city had surrendered. Upon hearing the news, the army headed back towards Autun. On the march back, Garibaldi began to consider returning to Dijon in an attempt to regain control from the Prussians. He felt that attacking at night would minimize the effect of the Prussians' far larger numbers. As the army headed towards Dijon, they passed through Lantenay, where, standing atop a plateau, they spotted a contingent of the Prussian army headed their way from Dijon. Garibaldi and his officers decided that this was their chance to make an impact. They prepared the field of battle to their advantage and waited. Once the Prussians were within range, the army began to fire on the Prussians, who, caught by surprise, fought for a moment then retreated. Sensing victory, Garibaldi pursued the retreating army all the way back to Dijon. Arriving at Dijon with roughly 5,000 men Garibaldi attacked the Prussians that evening. Though his soldiers were passionate and aggressive, they were also raw recruits against an army larger and better trained. The assault went on into the night; however, victory was not to be, and once again the Army of the Vosges retreated back to Autun. This time, the Prussians followed them. The Prussians arrived at Autun and laid siege to the city. Just as it appeared that all hope was lost, General Carl Wilhelm von Werder recalled his troops to Dijon. General von Werder had noticed a buildup of French troops near Dijon and therefore wanted the army back to help defend the city. This was not to be however, as shortly after the arrival of the army to Dijon, in late December, von Werder ordered that the city be evacuated. With the Prussian army gone from Autun, the Army of the Vosges had precious time to recoup and recover. In addition to the rest, the time also gave the Army time to plan. It was decided that the Army, along with other French forces, would return to Dijon, now unoccupied, and hold the city once more. Due to the winter weather, getting the Army to Dijon took some time. The battle for the Army of the Vosges resumed on January 21, 1871. The Prussians attacked Dijon from the West in great numbers; however, the French had been preparing and the defenses of the city were well in place. The two armies went back and forth for three days. Each time one army made headway, the opposing army would push back, gaining ground. On the fourth day, The Prussian army pulled back and the fighting ceased for a while. The fighting renewed the next day and continued sporadically until January 31, 1871. At this point, the Army of the Vosges was tired and had taken many casualties. Because of this, the Army of the Vosges pulled out of Dijon and retreated to Courcelles. The Prussians once again held Dijon, beginning the morning of February 1, 1871. After The War \\"The French government surrendered Paris to the German army at the end of January, and brought the war to a close.\\"Riall, Lucy. Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007. p.354 The Army disbanded and Giuseppe Garibaldi was elected to serve in the National Assembly of Dijon. Garibaldi wanted to attend and speak at the first meeting of the National Assembly; however, he was shouted down and therefore resigned his seat and returned to Italy.

On the runestone Gs 13, Freygeirr is reported to be the leader of an expedition to Tavastia: :Gs 13: Brúsi had this stone erected in memory of Egill, his brother. And he died in Tafeistaland, when Brúsi brought (= led?) the land's levy(?) (= army) in memory of, his brother. He travelled with Freygeirr. May God and God's mother help his soul. Sveinn and Ásmundr, they marked. In Denmark, there is a runestone in memory of a warrior who fell in Sweden while he was in the retinue of a man who was either named Friggir or Freygeirr:Pritsak 1981:399 :DR 216: Ástráðr and Hildungr/Hildvígr/Hildulfr raised this stone in memory of Fraði/Freði, their kinsman.

U 698 and U 611 are raised in memory of two men who died in the retinue of a warchief whose name has been reconstructed by runologists as Freygeirr: :U 698: [...] had the stone raised in memory of Ásgeirr, his son. He fell in Lífland, abroad in Freygeirr's(?) retinue.Rundata :U 611: Bjôrn and Steinfríðr had the stone raised in memory of Gísli. He fell abroad in Freygeirr's(?) retinue.

He met his end in the sound of Chenotet (Selaön), and the others abroad in Greece. May God help their spirits and souls. (\\"Greece\\"—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire.) The Rundata project places Freygeir's death near the island of Selaön in lake Mälaren. According to another theory the runes isilu represent *isi[s]la and they are to be transcribed as *ī ey-sȳsla, i.e. \\"in Ösel\\" (Saaremaa).Pritsak 1981:363 Another runestone mentioning a Freygeirr was raised by his sons: :U 1158: Guðsteinn(?) and Eistr and ... and Áki had the stone raised in memory of Freygeirr, their father.

Kinship  Rewi, or Manga as he was known to his kin, was the child of Paraheke (Te Kore) and Te Ngohi. His mother Paraheke was from Ngati Raukawa with close connections to Ngati Kaputuhi. His father Te Ngohi, also known as Kawhia, was a renowned fighting chief of Ngāti Paretekawa a sub-hapu of Ngati Maniapoto and was a signatory to the Treaty of Waitangi, one of five chiefs from Maniapoto who signed. Rewi had a younger brother named Te Raore or Te Roore who was killed at Orakau. Te Raore married Kereihi aka Te Oreore Purau from Ngati Tuwhakataha and they had a daughter named Te Raueue Te Raore who died leaving no issue. When Pareheke was killed at Paterangi, Te Ngohi remarried a woman named Kahutuangau from Ngati Te Kanawa and Ngati Parekahuki a sub hapu of Ngati Maniapoto, they had a daughter named Te Whakahae aka Ripeka she was a half-sister to Rewi Manga Maniapoto and all her descendants are the Muraahi, Mokau and Waho families from Napinapi Marae near the settlement of Piopio. Early life As a young man he accompanied his father on attacks in Taranaki during the long running, intertribal, musket wars. He gave protection to the missionary Morgan who moved into his rohe in 1841. He became friendly with Catholic missionaries who also settled in the area. He was educated by Wesleyan missionaries and became literate and welcomed the development of his rohe into a productive European style farming community with the planting of wheat, the establishment of several flour mills, and the mass planting of fruit trees. The missionaries, together with the government, initially financed the mills and arranged for European millers to settle and produce flour. The missionaries built a trade school in Te Awamutu to teach literacy and practical skills such as making and repairing agricultural tools. Conflict arose between competing Waikato iwi in the Te Awamutu area over long- contested land. Ngati Maniapoto was jealous of the attention given to Ngati Mahuta and Ngati Raukawa who had acquired European knowledge and goods. Initially, only a few acres were sold to settlers. Later 800 acres was sold for the trade school and its food supply. Tensions simmered verging on open war. Ngati Mahuta was intimidated by Maniapoto and promised not to sell any more land. Throughout this period Rewi Maniapoto was the tribal chief.The Māori King. pp 21-23 J Gorst. Reed. Singapore. 2001. The core of Ngati Mahuta then moved out of the area in 1849 to settle on land in Mangere provided for them by the government to guard Auckland from an attack from the south.The Royal NZ Fencibles 1847-52.pp 108-109.The NZ Fencible Society. Deed. Waiuku.1997 This event demonstrates the character of the redoubtable Rewi, as Te Wherowhero was a great warrior chief not to be trifled with. During the 1850s he became influenced by Māori who wanted greater autonomy. He was one of five chiefs who signed a document banning Government magistrates from his rohe. When conflict arose over Māori land sales in Taranaki he sided with those Māori who withheld their land from sale and by 1860 was supporting the Taranaki chief Wiremu Kīngi in his struggle with the government. Rewi went to Taranaki and took part in the fighting against the government and was involved in two battles himself. Increasingly he became aware that the governor George Grey was determined to undermine the Kīngitanga movement. Grey came to the Waikato and bluntly told chiefs he would dig around the movement until it fell. By 1863 tension in the Waikato rose as Rewi took more militant action. On 4 April Grey arranged for a 300-strong Imperial force to evict Māori from the contested Tataramaika block in Taranaki and reoccupy it. Māori viewed the reoccupation as an act of war and on 4 May a party of about 40 Ngati Ruanui warriors carried out a revenge attack, ambushing a small military party on a coastal road at nearby Oakura, killing all but one of the 10 soldiers. The ambush, ordered by Rewi, may have been planned as an assassination attempt on Grey, who regularly rode the track between New Plymouth and the Tataraimaka military post. He destroyed a magistrates court in North Waikato and together with Wiremu Kīngi destroyed the trade school at Te Awamutu, stealing the press. Rewi was annoyed that the government was publishing an anti-Kīngitanga paper in his rohe. Other Waikato chiefs were concerned at his actions. Several large meetings were held, such as the one at Peria, where Rewi argued his case for attacking the government, while others, such as Wiremu Tamihana, argued for a less extreme approach and more negotiation with the government. Other events, such as the attempted kidnapping of settlers' wives and children, further raised tension, as did the interference by Catholic missionaries who suggested British settlers and officials were spies. Pompallier, the Catholic Bishop, further heightened tension by suggesting he start another mission in the area to counter the influence of the protestant Church Missionary Society (CMS). As the king's sister, Te Paea, and other chiefs such as Wi Koramoa and Tanti(sic) were protestant this did not eventuate.The Maori King p 124.Te Ara, The Encyclopedia of NZ.Story Maniapoto, Rewi Manga.The Waikato War of 1863-64.N Ritchie.

Capper Press.1974 reprint  Invasion of the Waikato  On 10 July 1863 Grey ordered the invasion of the Kingite territory, claiming he was making a punitive expedition against Rewi over the Oakura ambush and a pre-emptive strike to thwart a \\"determined and bloodthirsty\\" plot to attack Auckland. On 12 July General Cameron and the first echelon of the invading army crossed the Mangatawhiri Stream \\\\- the Invasion of the Waikato had begun. Maniapoto fought 1863-64 and made a final stand at Orakau in 1864. Rewi and the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement) rebels were surrounded by the government forces, with limited supplies of food and water. The government forces built a sap (trench) up to within 20m of the pā and threw in hand grenades. Gilbert Mair, an officer who spoke Māori fluently, invited them to surrender or at least let out the woman and children. The Kingites replied with the famous words \\"Ka whawhai tonu mātou, Ake! Ake! Ake!\\" (\\"We will fight on forever and ever!\\").Rewi Maniapoto biography, nzhistory.com At 3:30pm the same day a gun was brought to the head of the sap and shelled the pā at point- blank range. At this the defenders panicked and, leaving 50 toa (warriors) in the pā, the rest made a sudden breakthrough the government lines and into adjacent swamps. All 50 in the pā were killed or taken prisoner. 160 Kīngitanga rebels died. Half of the escapees were wounded. Seventeen of the government forces died and 52 were wounded. Move to the King Country Maniapoto stayed in the King Country south of the Puniu River with the surviving rebels. He constructed two more pā but the government forces did not follow him into the hills. Maniapoto played host to the rebel Waikato iwi (tribe) but relationships soured when the king tried to exert his mana over Maniapoto's land. This, together with Maniapoto's refusal to stand and fight at the battle of Rangiriri in 1863, left a bitter note between the two rebel groups. Rewi became concerned at the outbreaks of drunkenness among his people and the murdering of isolated Pakeha travelling in the area. Rewi reluctantly sheltered the rebel Te Kooti, who had escaped from the Chatham Islands and then attacked and killed various Māori and European settlers. When Te Kooti came to Te Kuiti in 1869 he came to challenge Tawhaio for Māori kingship. The king was hostile to Rewi's actions as he did not want the Kīngitanga associated with Te Kooti's extreme violence and anti government activity yet he was very nervous of the Te Kooti's power to dominate. For months Rewi observed Te Kooti at close hand, as the Kīngitanga were considering restarting the fight against the government. The Kīngitanga was impressed by Te Kooti's audacity. Rewi himself wanted to judge Te Kooti's military prowess before coming to some political arrangement with him. They offered Te Kooti the option of living in peace in the King Country but he refused. After his decisive defeat at Te Porere, Rewi reported back that Te Kooti was no military genius. Magistrate William Searancke, who spoke fluent Māori, was present when Rewi met with Te Kooti and reported to the government that Te Kooti got very drunk and spoke at length about his past but not the future. Rewi Maniapoto remained sober and watchful.Redemption Songs.J. Binney. p178-180.Auckland University Books.Auckland. 1996. Return In 1877 MP John Sheehan became Native Minister. He was a fluent Māori speaker and had assisted East Coast Māori in the Repudiation Movement in their efforts to reclaim the land they claimed had been wrongfully sold to large runholders. Sheehan had enhanced his reputation with Māori for backing them against government authority. He went to the King Country to talk to King Tāwhiao and Taranaki chiefs to get them to sell land to the government but they refused. However, he discovered that Rewi Maniapoto was keen to sell land. Initially, the government's idea was to open up the land to European settlers to encourage assimilation. Eventually Rewi agreed to sell land to the government for the main trunk railway line on the understanding that his men would be paid to cut the bush for the surveyors and no alcohol was to be sold in the King Country. Maniapoto was returned his tribal land at Kihikihi and given a house and a government pension. He became a great friend of Governor Grey and wished to be buried with him. Rewi Maniapoto used his connections with the government to help the renegade Te Kooti be released from jail and resettle him on land in Whanganui .

Rome is represented in the shape of a lion, and the map reflects an evident interest in the distribution of bishoprics. There was text around the map, which included descriptions of animals, the creation of the world, definitions of terms, and a sketch of the more common sort of T and O map with an explanation of how the world is divided into three parts. The map incorporated both pagan and biblical history. The original was destroyed in 1943, during the Allied bombing of Hanover in World War II. There survives a set of black-and-white photographs of the original map, taken in 1891, and several colour facsimiles of it were made before it was destroyed. Authorship The arguments for Gervase of Tilbury's being the mapmaker are based on the name Gervase, which was an uncommon name in Northern Germany at the time, and on some similarities between the world views of the mapmaker and Gervase of Tilbury.

It was formally based in Palo Alto, California, but the bulk of its planning and operations were steered from Israel, where both its founder Shai Agassi and its chief investors resided. The company opened its first functional charging station the first week of December 2008 at Cinema City in Pi-Glilot near Tel Aviv, Israel The first customer deliveries of Renault Fluence Z.E. electric cars enabled with battery switching technology began in Israel in the second quarter of 2012, and at peak in mid September 2012, there were 21 operational battery-swap stations open to the public in Israel. Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark, after spending about million in private capital. After two failed post-bankruptcy acquisition attempts, the bankruptcy receivers sold off the remaining assets in November 2013 to Gnrgy for only $450,000. History =Launch= The company was publicly launched on October 29, 2007, as Project Better Place, by Shai Agassi, the company's founder and CEO at the time. According to Agassi, his vision was inspired by a question asked by Klaus Schwab at the 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: \\"How do you make the world a better place by 2020?\\"Better Place: „leadership team: Shai Agassi“ As of January 2011 it had raised $700 million, and about a third was spent in setting up the battery switch stations. Also, several countries and states had offered tax breaks. Better Place announced deployment of electric vehicle networks in Israel, Denmark and Hawaii in 2008 and 2009. The company planned to deploy the infrastructure on a country-by-country basis, and said it was in talks with more than 25 additional regions around the world. Australia, Ontario, Oregon, and California also announced deployment of Better Place electric car networks. In January 2008, Better Place announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Renault-Nissan to build the world's first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) model for Israel. Under the agreement, Better Place would build the electric recharge grid, and Renault-Nissan would provide the electric vehicles. =Bankruptcy= A shut-down battery swap station in Israel. In early October 2012, Agassi resigned from his role as worldwide Better Place CEO, and was replaced by Evan Thornley, CEO of Better Place- Australia. Agassi briefly remained on the company board, but a week later he resigned from that position as well. A few days after Thornley's appointment, Better Place asked its investors for a round of emergency funding, totalling about $100 million. On October 29, 2012, Ynet reported that Better Place would that week lay off 150 to 200 of its 400-person staff in Israel as it sought financing to combat its cash-flow problems. In late January 2013, Thornley was fired by Chairman Idan Ofer, and Dan Cohen was named acting CEO by the board. As a consequence of the financial problems, the Australian rollout was put on hold, as the company decided to concentrate on its two existing markets. However, on 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel. Following the decision of the Board of Directors of the global company, Better Place Danmark A/S also decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on the same date. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about million in private capital, and market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi, who expected 100,000 cars on Israeli roads by 2010. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 cars in Denmark. Under Better Place's business model, the company owned the Fluence Z.E. batteries, so the court liquidator would have to decide what to do with customers who do not have ownership of the battery and risk being left with a useless car. =Post-bankruptcy acquisition attempts and liquidation= In July 2013, an attempt to acquire Better Place was made by the Sunrise group that comprised entrepreneur Yosef Abramowitz and the Association for the Advancement of Electric Transportation in Israel. Court filings showed that the acquisition would be worth 18 million Israeli shekels () for Better Place's assets in Israel, and 25 million Israeli shekels () for its intellectual property, held by Better Place Switzerland. The deal was canceled by the court after the Sunrise group failed to make the first agreed payment of 3.52 million shekels (), even after an extension. In August 2013, the Central District Court ruled that Better Place Israel would be sold to Success Assets Ltd., owned by Tsahi Merkur, for 11 million shekels (million). To effect the acquisition, Merkur was to sign a personal guarantee within seven days for the full amount of the acquisition, and a personal guarantee for a letter of indemnification covering the guarantees made by Better Place Israel's subsidiaries to the Ministry of Transport. Within 21 days, Merkur was to deposit with the company's special managers an opinion on a property on which a commitment to register a lien of up to 5 million shekels would be placed. By 30 September 2013 he was to make a payment of 2 million shekels. On 17 October 2013 the deal was canceled after Success Assets failed to make the required payments. In November 2013, the court-appointed receivers decided to sell the remaining assets of Better Place in parts and liquidate the business. Business model =History of the battery swap concept= The steam car, the internal combustion engine automobile, and the electric car emerged as the main competing technologies in the late 1890s until the 1920s. The concept of exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896 in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period vehicles using it covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries. Electric forklifts have used battery swapping since at least 1946 and a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to help maintain 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics in China. =Better Place business model= Better Place implemented a business model wherein customers entered into subscriptions to purchase driving distance similar to the mobile telephone industry from which customers contract for minutes of airtime. The initial cost of an electric vehicle might also have been subsidized by the ongoing per-distance revenue contract just as mobile handset purchases are subsidized by per-minute mobile service contracts. Better Place's goal was to enable electric cars to sell for $5,000 less than the price of the average gasoline car sold in the United States, or the impact of electric cars would be minimal. For example, the Prius hybrid had been sold for 13 years at a price of $4,000 more than other gasoline cars and had captured less than 2% of the worldwide car market. The Better Place approach was to enable manufacturing and sales of different electric cars separately from their standardized batteries in the same way that petrol cars are sold separately from their fuel. Petrol is not purchased upfront, but is bought a few times a month when the fuel tank needs filling. Similarly, the Better Place monthly payment would cover electric \\"fuel\\" costs including battery, daily charging and battery swaps. Better Place was to allow customers to pay incrementally for battery costs including electric power, battery life, degradation, warranty problems, maintenance, capital cost, quality, technology advancement and anything else related to the battery. The per-distance fees would cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, purchasing sustainable electricity, profits, and the cost of investor capital. All battery problems would be handled by Better Place which would then bundle the costs and bill their customers monthly for providing all the infrastructure. The Better Place electric car charging infrastructure network was based on a smart grid software platform using Intel Atom processors and .NET Framework, or comparable vendors. This platform was first of its kind in the world and was to enable Better Place to manage the charging of hundreds of thousands of electric cars simultaneously by automatically time-shifting recharging away from peak demand hours of the day, preventing overload of the electrical grid of the host country. According to Agassi, Better Place would be able to provide electricity for millions of electric cars without adding a single electricity generator or transmission line by using smart software that oversaw and managed the recharging of electric cars connected with Better Place. An analysis of this business model and some of the missing considerations was late developed by the University of Denmark.http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/60664/1/Noel%20%20Sovacool_Better%20Place%20Manuscript%204%2011%202016.pdf Better Place encouraged governments to mandate the use of international standards and open access to recharge across charging networks to facilitate competing networks. Standardization efforts such as SAE J1772, however, had not yet yielded global consensus . Better Place displayed Charge Spot charging stations that used a connector with the same pin layout as SAE J1772-2009 but housed in a non-standard, triangular plug. They also displayed a wall mounted charging station using IEC 62196 Type 2 receptacle. Battery pack switching outside of Better Place's network was not to be allowed. Better Place said it had pre-sold enough contracts to make its first deployed network in Israel profitable at launch. Energy sources Agassi stated that the company's plan was to have the network's electricity generated entirely by renewable energy from solar arrays and wind farms if necessary, thus invalidating the \\"long- smokestack\\" accusation leveled against electric vehicles which rely on the nonrenewable sources of the electricity. However, achieving the 100% renewable energy goal would have depended on the local electric grid's energy sources. In Israel, where the first Better Place deployment took place, the electric grid is based mostly on fossil fuels, rendering the renewable energy vision practically impossible in the short term. Cars and batteries Prototype modified Renault Laguna EVs charging at the Better Place visitor centre in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, north of Tel Aviv. Nissan eRogue in Hawaii. The first prototype car was the Renault Laguna with a battery instead of a fuel tank and an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The battery for electric vehicles was a Lithium iron phosphate ion device. The range of the car running on just one battery was from about to . By replacing the battery at a battery switch station, the range between longer charging stops was to be limited only by the geographical distribution of the battery- swapping infrastructure. The second demo car was the Nissan eRogue, an electric car based on the Renault-Nissan Rogue, halfway between a sedan and an SUV in size. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was announced at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 15, 2009 as the first electric car to be available on the Better Place network using a switchable battery. Shai Agassi said that EVs had to be priced at $5,000 less than the price of the average gasoline car to be successful. In April 2010 Renault announced that sales of the Fluence Z.E. were scheduled for 2011 in Israel, Denmark and the rest of Europe. In August 2010 Better Place announced a non-binding order of 100,000 Renault Fluence ZE and four months later Better Place claimed to have sold 70,000 cars from that order, a year away from the public launch of its network. The floor-mounted battery packs in these electric cars were designed to be changed out robotically in less than two minutes, which was quicker than the average petroleum refuel, allowing for battery-swap services like those proposed by Better Place and Tesla Motors. Better Place expected battery packs to cost between US 4¢ and 5¢ per mile over their life, provide the cars with a range per charge, perform for 2000 recharge cycles, and last for 8 years. Battery- Swapping Stations With areas around cities covered with battery switching stations, also called battery-swap stations, drivers would potentially have electric cars with an unlimited driving range for long distance trips. The QuickDrop battery switch system would enable Renault Fluence Z.E.'s battery, the only vehicle deployed in the Better Place network, to be swapped in approximately three minutes at dedicated battery exchange stations. The actual robotic battery-switching operation took about five minutes in the deployed stations. While each exchange station would cost $500,000, The then CEO of Better Place, Shai Agassi, said that cost would be half the price of a typical petroleum fuelling station. Better Place's battery switching Station in Israel In order to access the battery switch station, Better Place customers would have to swipe their membership card. The remaining process was fully automated, similar to going through a car wash, so the driver never had to leave the car. In Better Place's demonstration battery switch stations, a robotic arm removed the depleted battery and replaced it with a full one. During 2010, Better Place operated a demonstration battery switch station in Tokyo allowing three specially equipped cabs to exchange their car's depleted battery pack for a fully recharged one in 59.1 seconds on average. Better Place used the same technology to swap batteries that F-16 jet fighter aircraft use to load their bombs. Better Place battery switch stations were claimed to support multiple battery types of all kinds of electric cars as long as the battery could be removed from under the car. A battery switch station using only 15 batteries allegedly had the ability to swap batteries for 2,500 EV's. Better Place claimed it had battery station installation teams who could install one battery switch station in just two days, one every 25 miles in every route and at the same cost of 7 days of oil in the United States, Better Place claimed it could cover all of the United States with battery switch stations and all the required infrastructure. =Battery switching versus DC fast charging= The main alternative technology to the battery-switching technique promoted by Better Place is DC fast charging. A nationwide fast charging infrastructure is/was being deployed in the United States that by 2013 would cover the entire nation. DC Fast Chargers are going to be installed at 45 BP and ARCO locations and will be made available to the public as early as March 2011. Better Place claimed that its subscription model had customers effectively paying only the prorated mileage cost without any battery ownership problems, whereas the fast charging model involves the customer bearing all the battery purchase, ownership, maintenance, and replacement costs, in addition to the cost of the electricity to recharge the battery. Better Place claimed that far fewer fast charging and battery switch stations would be needed than the current number of petroleum fuel refill stations, because drivers would usually recharge (\\"refuel\\") electric cars at home, offices, shopping centers, commercial areas, and the like. Drivers would only need alternatives if they forgot to recharge, couldn't get to a charge spot, had insufficient time at a charge spot, or were driving non-stop in excess of , typical of long distance vacations and business trips. DC fast charging was at the time considerably slower than Better Place's claimed 59 second battery switchover, but while Better Place battery switch stations would have cost around $500,000 each, DC fast chargers that the EV project is/was to deploy would cost only between $25,000 to $40,000. =Demonstration projects= Yokohama On May 13, 2009, Better Place premiered their battery switching station to the public in Yokohama where they had been invited by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.Better Place Unveils First Automated Battery Switch for Japan EV Study , Press Release, May 12, 2009 The battery switching station demonstrated was set up similarly to a gas station automatic car wash. The vehicle drove up on a ramp and was aligned on the swapping pad. The battery shuttle then engaged and rose up toward the bottom of the vehicle. It made contact with the battery, released it, lowered it, and moved the depleted battery pack away from the car. The charged battery pack was then inserted. The discharged battery was returned to the charging bay. The battery switch was complete in less than two minutes and the vehicle drove away. The battery swap was designed to require less time than filling a tank of gas. In order to keep electric vehicles in demand, Better Place was going to try to keep the vehicles competitive with the other cars on the market. By building infrastructure that made owning an electric car more practical, they hoped to increase demand. The first prototype battery switch station opened in Yokohama, Japan on May 14, 2009, was designed by Yoav Heichal, chief engineer for Better Place research and development group. The company signed an agreement with Dor Alon Energy to install battery replacement points, which would run alongside the petroleum refueling station' normal business. Dor Alon CEO, Israel Yaniv, said, \\"Dor Alon is the first energy company that will enable owners of electric car owners of the future to obtain electric refueling services at its gas stations. We consider this agreement with Better Place to be a strategic partnership that will create real value and innovation for the company's activity.\\" Tokyo In April 2010, a 90-day switchable- battery electric taxi demonstration project was launched in Tokyo, using three Nissan Rogue crossover utility vehicles, converted into electric cars with switchable batteries provided by A123 Systems. The battery switch station deployed in Tokyo was more advanced than the Yokohama switch system demonstrated in 2009.http://blog.betterplace.com/2010/04/countdown-to-the- opening-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-switchable-battery-electric-taxi- operation/ During the three-month field test the EV taxis accumulated over and swapped batteries 2,122 times, with an average battery swap time of 59.1 seconds. Nissan decided to continue the trial until late November 2010. San Francisco In October 2010 Better Place announced its commitment to launch a three-year demonstration program with electric-powered taxis in the San Francisco Bay Area, in partnership with the cities of San Francisco and San Jose, California, taxi operators and carsharing programs, regional and state agencies, consumer and EV organizations, and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The program would deploy and operate four battery switching stations in the San Francisco to San Jose corridor to support a fleet of switchable-battery EV taxis. , Better Place had made no further statements of progress on this program. Netherlands A battery-powered 10-taxi demonstration project was launched at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, in 2012. Investors , the company had raised from various sources including, VantagePoint Venture Partners, Israel Corporation (33% ownership), Israel Cleantech Ventures, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Acorns to Oaks II, Esarbee Investments Canada, GC Investments LLC, Musea Ventures, Ofer Group, Vyikra Partners, Wolfensohn & Co. and Maniv Energy Capital. In late 2007, Agassi began raising in Series-A funding for the project, one of the largest and fastest seed rounds in history. Investors included VantagePoint Venture Partners, Israel Corporation, Israel Cleantech Ventures, Morgan Stanley, and private investors led by Michael Granoff of Maniv Energy Capital. In 2009, the company raised an additional for Better Place Denmark, including an investment from DONG Energy the leading utility in Denmark. Following the announcement in Israel, Better Place said it had launched its network in Denmark, Australia and in two United States locations - Hawaii and Northern California. The company said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world. In Australia, Better Place announced agreements with AGL Energy and financial advisor Macquarie Capital Group to raise and begin deploying an electric vehicle (EV) network powered by renewable energy. According to Better Place, its model for sustainable mobility would help Australia move toward oil independence. With the world's seventh highest per capita rate of car ownership, the country had nearly 15 million cars on the road after adding over a million new cars in 2007.

The deal represented one of the largest financial investments of its kind by HSBC, which gained a seat on the Better Place board of directors and approximately 10% of the company's shares.Better Place wins $350 m. investment, (January 26, 2010), in Israel 21c Innovation News Service, retrieved 2010–01–26 From its early days, doubts were raised as to the effectiveness of Better Place's centralised model of providing charging infrastructure, with some anticipating that the model would not be widely adopted. =Partners= In May 2008, the company presented a prototype of its electric car at a press conference in Tel Aviv. Shai Agassi estimated that the company's partner, the Renault-Nissan alliance, would likely invest $500 million to $1 billion in developing the swappable-battery electric cars. Further partnerships with other manufacturers were not announced, and Peter Rawlinson, VP and Chief Engineer for Vehicle Engineering at Tesla was quoted as saying “Different batteries suit different cars. It's far too simplistic to look at batteries as isolation,” Better Place also announced plans to develop electric recharge grids in the city of San Francisco and the state of Hawaii. Australian finance group Macquarie said it would work with Better Place to fund the construction of plug-in stations, and Australian utility AGL Energy committed to powering those stations with renewable electricity.LexisNexis, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. Response In March 2008, Deutsche Bank analysts issued a glowing report on the company stating that its approach could be a \\"paradigm shift\\" that caused \\"massive disruption\\" to the auto industry, and which had \\"the potential to eliminate the gasoline engine altogether.\\" Three months later, the same institution issued a second report, finding \\"electric vehicles destined for much more growth than is widely perceived\\". The same report stated that \\"[i]mprovements in battery technology will allow for increased power, increased electrical propulsion, and bigger gains in fuel economy.\\" On June 26, 2008, Shai Agassi testified before the United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. The hearing, titled \\"$4 Gasoline and Fuel Economy: Auto Industry at a Crossroads,\\" dealt with the future role of the auto industry and the federal government in fighting gas prices and the fuel economy standards proposed in response to the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007. In 2009, CBS Money Watch cast doubts on Better Place's business model, noting that it would cost up to $500,000 to construct a battery switching station Markets and pricing =Australia= A Better Place Mitsubishi i-MiEV company car in Melbourne. A public Better Place charging station in Canberra. In Australia a roll-out of 500 charge stations was planned to begin in the major eastern coast cities before expanding nationally. It was estimated that these would give comparable coverage to the existing 13,000 petrol stations then in operation. The total cost of this roll out was claimed to be between $1 to $1.25 billion AUD. The first charge spot was installed in Canberra in late 2011, but in January 2013, after fewer than 20 public charge spots had been installed the rollout was halted and the board of Better Place decided to concentrate on its two existing markets, Israel and Denmark. Better Place was also to be the preferred provider of home and dealership charging stations for the Holden Volt, with the partnership announced in July 2012. =China= In 2011, Better Place announced an agreement with China Southern Power Grid Company, the world's eighth-largest utility company. Before the end of the year, Better Place was going to open a battery switch station and joint education center in the southern city of Guangzhou. Shai Agassi said that China Southern Grid was embracing battery switch as the primary means of range extension. China Southern Grid Chairman Zhao Jianguo said that the battery-switch model might become mainstream in China and that the joint visitor center and battery switch demonstration project with Better Place would help promote electric-car adoption in China by allowing potential customers to experience this innovative solution. China Southern Power Grid pilot projects and other joint activities were supposed to explore the benefits that switchable-battery electric cars and the networked infrastructure that supports them might deliver to the electric grid in CSG's service area, which spanned five provinces, one million square kilometers, and 230 million people in Southern China. Electric utility State Grid Corporation of China planned to build over 2,351 electric-charging and battery-swap stations by 2016. These would have had 220,000 charging poles, but they did not indicate how many, if any, of them would have been battery-swap stations. The director of the State Grid smart grid research center commented \\"The construction of a large-scale charging station costs 20 to 30 million yuan ($3.05-4.57 million) and a small-scale one costs less than 10 million yuan, but it costs more than 100 million yuan to build a battery-swap station.\\" In April 2010, Better Place signed a memorandum of understanding with Chery Automobile, China's biggest independent car maker, to develop prototypes for electric vehicles to be used in regional state-sponsored pilot projects. =Denmark= The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car available on the Better Place network in Israel and Denmark. A Better Place battery swap station in Denmark. Better Place partnered with Denmark's leading energy company, Dong Energy, in a €103 million Euro (770 million Danish Kroner) investment to introduce electric cars and infrastructure to Denmark. The country currently generates 20% of its electric power from wind energy, but much of it is exported because there is currently no way for utilities to store the excess power. Using the Better Place model, Dong hoped to take advantage of the existing electric grid and electric vehicle batteries to harness and store the abundance of wind-generated power, and distribute it appropriately for transportation consumption. The Renault Fluence Z.E. sold in Denmark at a price of 205,000 DKK (€27,496 or ) including VAT plus the monthly fee for the switchable-battery. Consumers paid a one-time fee of 9,995 DKK (€1,341) for a private charging station and customers were offered a choice of five fixed-price switchable-battery packages based on kilometers driven per year. For more than a year the monthly fee was 2,995 DKK () per month. The network commercial launch was in late 2011. The first battery switch station in Denmark, out of 20 which were planned to be deployed across the country as part of the network of charging infrastructure, was unveiled in June 2011 at in Gladsaxe, near Copenhagen. Sales of the Fluence Z.E. began in late 2011, and 198 units were sold in Denmark through December 2012. Cumulative sales through April 2013 reached 234 units.Select year and click on Pr. model for details of sales by brand and model. 198 units were sold in 2012 and 36 through March 2013. As of December 2012 there were 17 fully operational battery switch stations in the country, enabling Danish customers to drive anywhere across the country in an electric car. On 26 May 2013, and following the decision of the Board of Directors of Better Place's global company, Better Place Danmark A/S decided to begin bankruptcy proceedings. Because the batteries are owned by Better Place, Renault announced it would honor the existing agreement to around 500 customers that bought their electric cars through Better Place. =Hawaii= Better Place deployed about 80 charging stations and 154 charge points in Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the Big Island, and had almost 700 customers. The operation of the charging stations was acquired in March 2013 by OpConnect. No interruption of service was expected due to Better Place bankruptcy. =Israel= Parade of Renault Fluence Z.E. electric cars enabled with battery swapping technology to commemorate the first deliveries to Better Place employees in Israel in January 2012. Renault Fluence Z.E. sold through Better Place in Israel. Better Place charging stations outside the Leonardo Club Hotel in Tiberias. Israel was the first nation in the world to partner with Better Place to build an electric car infrastructure. Shai Agassi, former Better Place CEO, claimed that by 2016, plus or minus a year, more than 50% of cars sold in Israel would be electric. Battery switch stations were supposedly opening to customers almost weekly in 2012. That map indicates with \\"orange circles\\" the handful of battery switch stations available in June 2012, and shows with \\"grey circles\\" the full buildout of battery switch stations expected by year's end. The Baran Group signed an agreement with Better Place stating its intention to build 51 battery switch stations over the course of 2011 to cover all of Israel. However progress was not nearly as rapid as was planned. According to the Financial Times around 400 corporations in Israel signed letters of intent to begin switching their fleets to Better Place electric car network as soon as the service becomes available. This represented a potential of 80,000 electric cars. Out of the 100,000 Renault Fluence Z.E. that Better Place agreed to buy from Renault, the company claimed to have already signed around 70,000 orders, most of them from commercial fleet customers. Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The station was supposed to be the first of approximately 40 stations to begin operating in the near term. The battery exchange process took five minutes. The company also erected over 1,000 functional charging spots for the cars and thousands more were supposed to be put in place by the end of 2011, according to the CEO of Better Place Israel. Orders for the Renault Fluence ZE in Israel began in July 2011. According to Better Place, their customers regular maintenance costs would be about 40% less than for regular family cars, insurance also will be less at around NIS 3,700 a year, and its comprehensive solution of electric car and services would cut annual vehicle maintenance costs by 20%. The first deliveries of the Renault Fluence Z.E. took place on 22 January 2012 and around 100 electric cars were allocated to Better Place's employees. Better Place planned a staged delivery process as the infrastructure across the country was completed. Retail customer deliveries began in the second quarter of 2012. As of mid September 2012, there were 21 operational battery-swap stations open to the public in Israel. Cumulative sales through July 2012 reached 300 cars, and as of the end of October, just 490 cars had been sold, making the company's target of 4,000 customers by June 2013 a difficult goal to achieve. In October 2012, Better Place signed a deal with Elco to supply 125 cars worth NIS 15m. The 125 Renault Fluence ZEs were to be delivered through 2012 and 2013. , a total of 518 cars were sold in the country. In the first four months of 2013, a total 422 cars were sold, bringing the total to 940. A total of 518 units were sold in 2012 and 297 cars during the first quarter of 2013 Alan Gelman, chief financial officer said in January 2013 that the company had turned a corner in recent weeks with large sales to fleets and that the days of not selling cars were over Nevertheless, on 26 May 2013 the company filed for bankruptcy in Israel. Charging spot in Israel Customer Qualifications Better Place wanted electric car customers who could make a successful transition from range anxiety to ordinary range awareness within the company's growing infrastructure. During the sales process, Better Place aimed to educate and assess each customer's electric car suitability. The company was going to exclude drivers frequently traveling irregular routes that span the country. Eventually, Israel was supposed to have enough battery switch stations and recharging spots at parking garages, shopping centers, hotels, commercial areas, and elsewhere, to cater for most drivers. At minimum, customers needed dedicated off-road parking at home and, for higher mileage drivers, Better Place was going to install charging spots at people's workplace. The preferred high-mileage customer might commute each way between home and office. Lower distance customers might only need their home charging spot, with battery switching being infrequent. Israel Electric Grid Electric cars are not allowed by law to directly plug into ordinary Israeli electrical outlets. Better Place charging stations were to have smart grid interactivity that automatically time-shifted the charging process away from peak electrical demand hours. Most critics claimed it was an attempt to monopolize the charging of car batteries, and had in fact the reverse effect, which discouraged many potential customers in Israel from buying Better Place's cars. Awards Edmunds.com selected battery-charging infrastructure developers Coulomb Technologies and Better Place as recipients of its first annual Green Car Breakthrough Award. In 2010, Shai Agassi was included at number 28 in a list of the 100 Top Global Thinkers published by Foreign Policy magazine, for his efforts to make electric cars a mass-market success. Similar projects A number of companies have announced plans to install charging station networks. In France, Électricité de France (EDF) and Toyota announced plans to provide recharging points for PHEVs on roads, streets and parking lots. EDF also announced a partnership with Elektromotive, Ltd. to install 250 new charging points over six months from October 2007 in London and elsewhere in the UK. Coulomb Technologies was aiming to deploy its ChargePoint charging station network throughout the USA. In March 2009, Tesla Motors announced a partnership to deploy battery swap stations among their existing Supercharger network to service their Model S platform cars. Tesla abandoned battery swapping citing low demand. The Nation-E's Angel Car system is a portable unit, containing a lithium-ion battery, that stores energy and is used as an emergency charger for electric cars that run out of power. It designed to be a solution to \\"range anxiety\\" without the deployment of significant new infrastructure, and provides fast-charging services for all known Evs equipped with a fast-charging socket, including hybrid cars.

This battle consisted of attacks by Italian forces under Marshal Pietro Badoglio on Ethiopian forces under Ras Kassa Haile Darge and Ras Seyoum Mangasha. This battle, which resulted in a decisive defeat of Ethiopian forces, was primarily fought in the area around the Tembien Province. The battle is notable for the large-scale use of mustard gas by the Italians. Background On 3 October 1935, General Emilio De Bono advanced into Ethiopia from Eritrea without a declaration of War. De Bono advanced towards Addis Ababa with a force of approximately 100,000 Italian soldiers and 25,000 Eritreans. In December, after a brief period of inactivity and minor setbacks for the Italians, De Bono was replaced by Badoglio. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie launched the Christmas Offensive late in the year to test Badoglio. Initially successful, the goals of this offensive were overly ambitious. As the progress of the Christmas Offensive slowed, Italian plans to renew the advance on the northern front got under way. In addition to being granted permission to use poison gas, Badoglio received additional ground forces. The elements of the Italian III Corps and the Italian IV Corps arrived in Eritrea during early 1936.John Laffin. Brassey's Dictionary of Battles, pg. 28 By mid-January 1936, Badoglio was ready to renew the Italian advance. In response to his frequent exhortations, Badoglio cabled Mussolini: \\"It has always been my rule to be meticulous in preparation so that I may be swift in action.\\"Barker, The Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 59.John Laffin. Brassey's Dictionary of Battles, pg. 28 Preparation Italian offensives in 1936 In early January 1936 Ethiopian forces were in the hills overlooking the Italian positions and launching attacks against them on a regular basis. The Ethiopians facing the Italians were in three groups. In the center, near Abbi Addi and along the Beles River in the Tembien, were Ras Kassa with approximately 40,000 men and Ras Seyoum with about 30,000 men. On the Ethiopian right was Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu and his army of approximately 80,000 men in positions atop Amba Aradam. Ras Imru Haile Selassie with approximately 40,000 men was on the Ethiopian left in the area around Seleclaca in Shire Province.Barker, A. J., Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 55 Only a minority of the Ethiopian soldiers had received military training, there were few modern weapons and less than one rifle per man.Shinn, D. H. p. 234 Badoglio had five army corps at his disposal. On his right, he had the Italian IV Corps and the Italian II Corps facing Ras Imru in the Shire. In the Italian center was the Eritrean Corps facing Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum in the Tembien. Facing Ras Mulugeta dug into Amba Aradam was the Italian I Corps and III Corps. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was impatient for an Italian offensive to get under way.Barker, A. J., Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 59 Initially, Badoglio saw the destruction of Ras Mulugeta's army as his first priority. This force would have to be dislodged from its strong positions on Amba Aradam in order for the Italians to continue the advance towards Addis Ababa. But Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoumm were exerting such pressure from the Tembien that Badoglio decided that he would have to deal with them first. If the Ethiopian center was to successfully advance, I Corps and III Corps facing Ras Mulugeta would be cut off from reinforcement and resupply. From 20 January to 24 January, the First Battle of Tembien was fought. This was fiercely fought, with the Ethiopians cutting off the Italian Blackshirt Division for several days and Badoglio drawing up contingency plans for withdrawing the entire army. Eventually Italian pressure and the large scale use of mustard gas told and the threat Ras Kassa posed to the I Corps and III Corps was neutralized. From the 10 to 19 February, Badoglio attacked the army of Ras Mulugeta, dug in on Amba Aradam during the Battle of Enderta. The Italians made good use of their artillery and aerial superiority, and again the heavy use of Mustard gas. Ras Mulugeta was killed and his army collapsed and was destroyed as a fighting force in the ensuing rout. With this completed, Badoglio turned back to the center to complete what he had started with the First Battle of Tembien. He would leave the army of Ras Imru Haile Selassie for another day.Barker, A. J., Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 83 Badoglio now had three times the men fielded by the three remaining Ethiopian armies; extra divisions had arrived in Eritrea and the network of roads he needed to guarantee resupply had been all but completed. Even so, Badoglio stockpiled 48,000 shells and 7 million rounds of ammunition in forward areas before he started the attack. Badoglio planned to send the III Corps towards Gaela to cut off the main line of withdrawal for Ras Kassa. After establishing itself across the roads running south from the Abbi Addi region, the Eritrean Corps would advance south from the Worsege (Italian: Uarieu) and Ab'aro passes. These moves by the III Corps and the Eritrean Corps would place the armies of Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum in a trap. It is possible that Ras Kassa anticipated Badoglio's plan. He sent a wireless message to Emperor Haile Selassie requesting permission to withdraw from the Tembien. The request was superfluous, Selassie had already indicated that Ras Kassa should fall back towards Amba Aradam and link up with the remnants of Ras Mulageta's army. Battle Marshal Pietro Badoglio, Duke of Addis Abeba In accordance with Badoglio's plan, the Eritrean Corps advanced from the mountain passes and the III Corps moved up from the Geba Valley. The Second Battle of the Tembien was fought on terrain which favoured the defence. It was a region of forests, ravines, and torrents where the Italians were unable to deploy artillery properly or use armoured vehicles. But the warriors of Ras Seyoum failed to take advantage of the terrain and were defeated. The right wing of the Ethiopian armies rested on Uork Amba (the \\"mountain of gold\\"). The Ethiopians established a strong point there. Amba Work blocked the road to Abbi Addi on which the Eritrean Corps and the III Corp planned to converge. One-hundred- and-fifty Alpini and Blackshirt commandos were ordered to capture it under cover of darkness. Armed with grenades and knives, the commandos found the Ethiopians on the summit unprepared when they scaled the peak. Early on the morning of the 27 February, the army of Ras Seyoum was drawn up in battle array in front of Abbi Addi. Heralded by the wail of battle horns and the roll of the war drums (negarait), a large force of Ethiopians left the shelter of the woods covering Debra Ansa to attack the Italians in the open. From 8:00am to 4:00pm, wave after wave of Ethiopians attempted to break through or get around the positions established by the Alpini and the Blackshirts of the Eritrean columns. Armed for the most part with swords and clubs, the attacks were mowed down and turned back by concentrated machine gun fire.Barker, A. J., Rape of Ethiopia 1936, pp. 84–4 As the attacks wavered the Italian commander counterattacked. Ras Seyoum decided that his men could take no more. His army left more than one-thousand dead on the battlefield as it fled. Ras Kassa Haile Darge With his right flank in the air, Ras Seyoum ordered his army to pull back to the Tekezé fords. But, as his men straggled back along the one road open to them, they were bombed repeatedly. The rocky ravine where they were to cross the river turned out to be a bottleneck. The Italian bombers focused on the concentrated solid mass of defeated Ethiopians and soon the area was turned into a charnel house. Meanwhile, Ras Kassa and his army on Debra Amba had not yet seen action. Ras Kassa now decided to do what the Emperor had indicated and started to withdraw his army towards Amba Aradam. His army in turn was heavily bombed. On 29 February, the III Corps and the Eritrean Corps linked up about three miles west of Abbi Addi and the trap was complete. Even so, a large portion of both Ethiopian armies managed to escape Badoglio's dragnet. However, the men who escaped were demoralized and with little or no equipment. By the time Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum reached Haile Sellassie's headquarters at Quorom two weeks later, they were accompanied by little more than the men of their personal bodyguards. Aftermath Writing as a correspondent at Italian Military Headquarters, Herbert L. Matthews of the New York Times, cabled the following to his paper: A United Press correspondent wrote: Ras Mulugeta was dead. Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum were beaten. All three armies commanded by these men had been effectively destroyed. Only one of the four main northern armies remained intact. Badoglio now turned his attention towards Ras Imru and his forces in the Shire. Both Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum were present at Maychew, the final battle of the war.Barker, A.

Themes and history of song One of the most haunting themes of The Basement Tapes is an apprehension of the void. Shelton hears in this song an echo of the bald statement that Lear makes to his daughter Cordelia, \\"Nothing will come of nothing\\" (act I, scene 1). Marcus asserts that this was one of the songs recorded at the end of \\"the basement summer\\" in August or September 1967. He writes that these songs \\"are taken slowly, with crying voices. Dylan’s voice is high and constantly bending, carried forward not by rhythm or by melody but by the discovery of the true terrain of the songs as they’re sung. Richard Manuel’s and Rick Danko’s voices are higher still, more exposed.\\" Cover versions By November 1967, this song was a Top 40 hit for Peter, Paul and Mary. In Dylan's original, the chorus addresses two ladies—\\"Say hello to Valerie/Say hello to Vivien/Send them all my salary/On the waters of oblivion\\"—but Peter, Paul and Mary changed the second name to \\"Marion,\\" displeasing Dylan. According to the trio's Paul Stookey, Dylan consequently became disenchanted with the group: \\"We just became other hacks that were doing his tunes.\\" Patrick Humphries notes that, whether by accident or design, the two women originally named share the names of the two wives of the major 20th-century poet T. S. Eliot.Eliot married Vivienne Haigh-Wood in 1915; they separated in 1933. Critics consider their marriage central to his writing The Waste Land (). Eliot married Valerie Fletcher in January 1957, near the end of his life (). Lachlan MacKinnon Mackinnon, Lachlan, \\"T.S.Eliot's carelessness towards John Hayward\\", Times Literary Supplement , London, 12 March 2014 writes that the lines do refer to Eliot's wives and are \\"remarkably shrewd\\", suggesting the poet's \\"strange combination of self-distancing and financial propriety\\". Peter, Paul and Mary's recording of the song was also included on their 1968 album Late Again. This song also appeared on Spooky Tooth's debut album It's All About, and on Fotheringay's debut album, as well as Albert Lee's Black Claw & Country Fever sessions.

The club hosts its annual regatta as part of the Wirral Regattas series where local sailors come to compete on the River Mersey.  History  West Cheshire Sailing Club was founded at New Brighton in 1892 by members of the now defunct Magazine Sailing Club and New Brighton Sailing Club. The headquarters of the club, was located in a building on the New Brighton Pier. Boats were stored on shore at the pier, or on moorings in the Mersey. The club moved to its present location when the pier was demolished in 1961. The brass cannon, now kept in the club was a signal gun from a large steam yacht, White Eagle. She was built in Portsmouth, but spent most of her life in the Irish Sea on the Clyde. From time to time club members would fire this gun at special events. The first Club Dinner held by WCSC was held with the Victoria Rowing Club at the Hotel Victoria, New Brighton, before World War I. Two famous members of the club were Sir Ernest Marples MP, the man who planned the motorways and built the M1, as well as a stint as Postmaster General. He was for many years a member of the committee and Vice President from 1948 to 1958. Lieutenant Commander Ian Fraser RN VC, was also a member of the club committee and captain of the club for three years.

It was the most important Anglo-Norman lordship in the north of Ireland. At its greatest extent it extended as far west as the Inishowen peninsula in modern-day County Donegal, which was at one time the power-base of the Northern Uí Néill. The Earldom of Ulster suffered heavily from the Bruce campaign in Ireland in the 1310s, from which it never recovered. By the 15th century the earldom was restricted to coastal enclaves in County Down and Carrickfergus, and the title of Earl of Ulster had passed to the Crown in 1461. De Courcy's invasion of Ulaid 11th century major and minor kingdoms in Ulster prior to the arrival of the Normans in Ireland. In 1175 after a period of fighting between the Normans and Irish, the Irish High King, Rory O'Connor sued for peace with King Henry II of England who agreed to a status quo allowing the Normans to consolidate their conquests in return for no more incursions into Gaelic territory. Henry's Norman vassals however remained restless. In 1176, John de Courcy came to Ireland alongside William fitz Audelin, Henry II's deputy. Around the start of 1177 de Courcy went about carefully planning an invasion of Ulaid in eastern Ulster. Having acquired the approval of the royal governor in Dublin, de Courcy took 32 mailed horsemen and some 300-foot soldiers north into Meath, where he had obtained the right of passage through from its lord, de Lacy. He then met up with Irish allies who helped provide men and information for the invasion. De Courcy's force then advanced beyond the northern extent of Norman control and into Ulaid, reaching the petty-kingdom of Lecale having only set out from Dublin four days before. Until this, Ulaid had been untouched by \\"English\\" forces. De Courcy's force advanced on Downpatrick, the chief seat of the Dál Fiatach dynasty who then ruled Ulaid. Despite the small size of his force, de Courcy's attack caught the Ulaid by surprise forcing the over-king of Ulaid, Rory MacDonleavy (Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe) to flee. The papal legate, Cardinal Vivian, had been on a visit to Ulster when this attack happened and he called for the withdrawal of de Courcy's forces, however this went unheeded. About a week later, MacDunleavy returned to Downpatrick with a great host drawn from across Ulaid, however despite being vastly outnumbered, de Courcy's forces won the day. MacDonleavy followed up this attack with an even greater force made up a coalition of Ulster's powers that included the king of the Cenél nEógain, Máel Sechnaill Mac Lochlainn, and the chief prelates in the province. Again the Normans emerged victorious, even capturing the clergy involved included the Archbishop of Armagh, the Bishop of Down, and many of their relics. Despite forming alliances, constant inter-warring amongst the Ulaid and against their Irish neighbours continued oblivious to the threat of the Normans. De Courcy would take advantage of this instability and from his base in Downpatrick set about conquering the neighbouring districts in Ulaid. =Expansion= Over the following year de Courcy, overly eager to extend his conquests, suffered several setbacks as the Irish managed to gain some victories. In one instance the Normans suffered a heavy defeat against the combined forces of MacDonleavy and Murrough O'Carroll of Airgíalla, which was soon followed up by another defeat further north at the hands of the Uí Thuirtri and Fír Lí, the aftermath of which saw the Normans having to fight their way some 30 miles back to de Courcy's castle on foot, outnumbered and constantly harried by the Irish. Not all of Ulaid had fallen to de Courcy, the kingdom of Uíbh Eachach Cobha that was situated in central and western County Down, escaped conquest as did small areas here and there. The Normans rode through Eachach Coba (English: Iveagh) on their way from Dublin to Downpatrick, and the nature of their surprise attack suggests that the Eachach Coba had given support to, or at least assented to, de Courcy's plan. Subsequently the Magennis clan that ruled Eachach Coba profited from trading with the Earldom of Ulster, and following its collapse in 1333 took over some of its lands to the east, and rebuilt Magennis Castle. MacDonleavy continued to provide resistance to de Courcy, however Ulaid had been lost, and with it the balance of power in Ulster shifted. The success of de Courcy's invasion and ability to withstand the counter-attacks despite facing overwhelming odds is attributed to the military and technological superiority the Normans held in comparison to the Irish. =Consolidation= Throughout his domain, de Courcy built motte castles to establish a presence and stand guard at importance approaches. At least 128 mottes have been discovered in Ulster, the majority of which can be found in the area of greatest Norman presence; south County Antrim and north County Down. The mightiest castle that de Courcy would build was Carrickfergus Castle, which would eventually become his administrative center. He also built the castle of Rath, now known as Dundrum Castle, which stood guard over Lecale. All of the conquests made by de Courcy had quick and easy access to the sea, which provided a vital lifeline for him and his forces when needed. In 1180, de Courcy married Affrica, the daughter of the Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles, which allowed him to call upon a strong fleet further reinforcing his position. Despite the initial opposition to the Normans, the Ulaid seem to eventually seem to come to terms with their situation and even seek aid in resisting the increasing number of raids and attacks from the Northern Uí Néill. An example of which is in 1182, when an alliance between de Courcy and the Ulaid saw the defeat of an incursion by the Ó Doibhilin (Devlin) sept of the Northern Uí Néill. According to the Annals of the Four Masters: *In 1182, Domhnall mac Aodha Mac Lochlainn of the Northern Uí Néill, took an army to Dunboe in Fir na Craoibhe (eastern County Londonderry) to fight the English, however they were defeated with many Gaelic nobles killed. Having committed crimes against the Church and its servants in his conquest of Ulaid, de Courcy set about making amends by granting land to the Church and establishing abbeys. He renamed Dun-da- lethglas Downpatrick after Saint Patrick, and granted it to the Church, and had the alleged remains of saints Patrick, Brigid, and Colmcille, transferred there. For a quarter of a century, de Courcy ruled his domain like an independent king, styling himself princeps Ultoniae, \\"master of Ulster\\". He administered his own justice and even minted his own halfpennies and farthings. He was also described as \\"prince of the Ulster people\\" and in his arrest-warrant, was called by King John I of England, \\"King of all the barons of Ulster\\". =Incursions against the Northern Uí Néill= In 1197 John De Courcy's brother, Jordan, was killed by one of his Irish attendants and as revenge John attacked various Irish petty-kings. In this he was aided by Duncan, Earl of Carrick, who was the cousin of his wife Affreca. John led his army across the River Bann at Eas Craoibhe (the Salmon Leap, in modern-day Coleraine, County Londonderry), in Fir na Craoibhe, where they founded the castle of Kilsanctan. They then laid waste to the neighbouring territory of Cianachta. From the castle in Kilsanctan, Rotsel Piton (Peyton), who had been left in charge of a large force, set forth to plunder the surrounding territories and churches, going as far as the harbour at Derry. The Northern Uí Néill king, Flaithbertach Ó Mael Doraidh (Flaherty O'Muldory) of the Cenél Conaill, took a force and engaged Piton on the strand at Faughanvale resulting in a slaughter of the English as well as the death of a son of Ardgal Mac Lachlainn—of the ruling dynasty of the Cenél nEógain, rivals of the Cenél Conaill—who was on the side of the English. As reward for his help, Duncan was rewarded a sizeable portion of the territory subjugated from the Irish, stated as being along the northern coastline of present-day counties Antrim and Londonderry. From the death of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn (Murtough Mac Loughlin), king of the Cenél nEógain, over-king of the Northern Uí Néill, as well as High King of Ireland, in 1166, the Northern Uí Néill had been ruled by Flaithbertach Ó Mael Doraidh of the Cenél Conaill. During the same time the Cenél nEógain had had eight kings all of which had died violently, either in conflict with the Cenél Conaill or amongst themselves. Adding to the mix was the ascendancy of the Uí Neill (O'Neill) sept to the kingship of Cenél nEógain in place of the Mac Lachlainn's. Upon the death of Flaithbertach Ó Mael Doraidh in 1197, Echmarcach Ua Dochartaigh (O'Doherty) of the Cenél Conaill ascended to the kingship of the Cenél Conaill and Northern Uí Néill. With the death of Ó Mael Doraidh, de Courcy launched an expedition to Derry and camped there for five nights. Ua Dochartaigh attacked him however he was killed and his force defeated enabling de Courcy to plunder all the cattle of Inishowen. Two years later in 1199, de Courcy returned to Derry and plundered the surrounding countryside for a considerable amount of time until Aedh O'Neill of the Cenél nEógain led a counter-attack by sea at Larne in de Courcy's own territory. In 1200 and 1204 de Courcy launched raids into the Cenél nEógain's territory, Tír Eoghain, however these were futile, the last battle of which was led by Dermot Mac Lachlainn, who was killed. It seems pretty evident that de Courcy was aiding the Mac Lachlainn's in their claim to the kingship of Cenél nEógain and as such received their aid in attacking their principle rivals and enemies, the Uí Neill's and Cenél Conaill.

He is best known for his theorem on Saccheri quadrilaterals. He may also be referred to as Vitale Giordani, Vitale Giordano da Bitonto, and simply Giordano. De componendis gravium momentis, 1687 Life Giordano was born in Bitonto, in southeastern Italy, probably on October 15, 1633. As an adolescent he left (or was forced to leave) his city and, after an adventurous youth (that included killing his brother-in-law for calling him lazy) he became a soldier in the Pontifical army. During these adventures he read his first book of mathematics, the Aritmetica prattica by Clavius. At twenty-eight, living in Rome, he decided to devote himself to mathematics. The most important book he studied was Euclid's Elements in the Italian translation by Commandino. In Rome he made acquaintance with the renowned mathematicians Giovanni Borelli and Michelangelo Ricci, who became his friends. He was employed for a year as a mathematician by ex-Queen Christina of Sweden during her final stay in Rome. In 1667, a year after its foundation by Louis XIV, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the French Academy in Rome, and in 1685 he gained the chair of mathematics at the prestigious Sapienza University of Rome. Friend of Vincenzo Viviani, Giordano met Leibniz in Rome when Leibniz stayed there during his journey through Italy in the years 1689-90\\\\. He gave Leibniz a copy of the second edition of his book Euclide restituto. Giordano died on November 3, 1711, and was buried in the San Lorenzo in Damaso basilica church in Rome. Work Giordano's theorem Giordano is most noted nowadays for a theorem on Saccheri quadrilaterals that he proved in his 1668 book Euclide restituo (named after Borelli's Euclides Restitutus of 1658). In examining Borelli's proof of the parallel postulate, Giordano noted that it depended upon the assumption that a line everywhere equidistant from a straight line is itself straight. This in turn is due to Clavius, whose proof of the assumption in his 1574 Commentary on Euclid is faulty.[T. L. Heath (1908), \\"The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, Vol. 1\\", p.194, University Press, Cambridge][George Bruce Halsted (1920), translator's preface to Saccheri's \\"Euclides Vindicatus\\", p.ix, The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago] So using a figure he found in Clavius, now called a Saccheri quadrilateral, Giordano tried to come up with his own proof of the assumption, in the course of which he proved: :If ABCD is a Saccheri quadrilateral (angles A and B right angles, sides AD and BC equal) and HK is any perpendicular from DC to AB, then :*(i) the angles at C and D are equal, and :*(ii) if in addition HK is equal to AD, then angles C and D are right angles, and DC is equidistant from AB. The interesting bit is the second part (the first part had already been proved by Omar Khayyám in the 11th century), which can be restated as: :If 3 points of a line CD are equidistant from a line AB then all points are equidistant. Which is the first real advance in understanding the parallel postulate in 600 years.[Roberto Bonola (1912), \\"Non-Euclidean Geometry\\", p.15, The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago][George Edward Martin (1998), \\"The Foundations of Geometry and the Non-Euclidean Plane\\", p.272, Springer] Publications Giordano's published work includes: *Lexicon mathematicum astronomicum geometricum (1st edition 1668, Paris. 2nd edition with additions 1690, Rome) *Euclide restituto, ovvero gli antichi elementi geometrici ristaurati e facilitati da Vitale Giordano da Bitonto.

The company is based in Borås, an old, traditional textile industry town in the South of Sweden. The initial concept of founder Anders Bengtsson was to develop underwear, which propels moisture away from the skin during physical activity. Craft started with technical baselayers and soon developed the three-layer principle with a 2nd layer of insulation and moisture transportation and an outer shell for protection. Today, the company offers gear for all kinds of sports focusing with layer 3 on running, triathlon, bike and cross-country skiing.  History  In 1973, Swede Anders Bengtsson started developing a baselayer material that transports moisture (sweat) away from the skin. Bengtsson tested his designs by weighing his gear after exercise sessions. He used polyester fibres, which only absorb a minimum of moisture and worked them in a special weaving construction. The so-called capillary action further promotes moisture expulsion transporting sweat from the skin to the outer surface of the garment where it quickly evaporates. The brand Craft of Sweden was officially founded in 1977. In addition to technical baselayers, the company soon started producing second layer garments (focusing on fleece material) and outerwear.

It is also what we expect from a strict JSON object representation. Note: if another document is like a union of these two, (3) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too. Mary also likes to watch football games. its JavaScript representation will be: BoW3 = {\\"John\\":1,\\"likes\\":3,\\"to\\":2,\\"watch\\":2,\\"movies\\":2,\\"Mary\\":2,\\"too\\":1,\\"also\\":1,\\"football\\":1,\\"games\\":1}; So, as we see in the bag algebra, the \\"union\\" of two documents in the bags-of- words representation is, formally, the disjoint union, summing the multiplicities of each element. BoW3 = BoW1 \\\\biguplus BoW2.  Application  In practice, the Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation. After transforming the text into a \\"bag of words\\", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text. The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text. For the example above, we can construct the following two lists to record the term frequencies of all the distinct words (BoW1 and BoW2 ordered as in BoW3): (1) [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] (2) [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] Each entry of the lists refers to the count of the corresponding entry in the list (this is also the histogram representation). For example, in the first list (which represents document 1), the first two entries are \\"1,2\\": * The first entry corresponds to the word \\"John\\" which is the first word in the list, and its value is \\"1\\" because \\"John\\" appears in the first document once. * The second entry corresponds to the word \\"likes\\", which is the second word in the list, and its value is \\"2\\" because \\"likes\\" appears in the first document twice. This list (or vector) representation does not preserve the order of the words in the original sentences. This is just the main feature of the Bag-of-words model. This kind of representation has several successful applications, such as email filtering. However, term frequencies are not necessarily the best representation for the text. Common words like \\"the\\", \\"a\\", \\"to\\" are almost always the terms with highest frequency in the text. Thus, having a high raw count does not necessarily mean that the corresponding word is more important. To address this problem, one of the most popular ways to \\"normalize\\" the term frequencies is to weight a term by the inverse of document frequency, or tf–idf. Additionally, for the specific purpose of classification, supervised alternatives have been developed to account for the class label of a document. Lastly, binary (presence/absence or 1/0) weighting is used in place of frequencies for some problems (e.g., this option is implemented in the WEKA machine learning software system).  n-gram model  The Bag-of-words model is an orderless document representation — only the counts of words matter. For instance, in the above example \\"John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too\\", the bag-of-words representation will not reveal that the verb \\"likes\\" always follows a person's name in this text. As an alternative, the n-gram model can store this spatial information. Applying to the same example above, a bigram model will parse the text into the following units and store the term frequency of each unit as before. [ \\"John likes\\", \\"likes to\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"watch movies\\", \\"Mary likes\\", \\"likes movies\\", \\"movies too\\", ] Conceptually, we can view bag-of-word model as a special case of the n-gram model, with n=1. For n>1 the model is named w-shingling (where w is equivalent to n denoting the number of grouped words). See language model for a more detailed discussion.  Python implementation  from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer sentence = [\\"John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.\\"] def print_bow(sentence: str) -> None: tokenizer = Tokenizer() tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentence) sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentence) word_index = tokenizer.word_index bow = {} for key in word_index: bow[key] = sequences[0].count(word_index[key]) print(bow) print(f\\"Bag of word sentence 1 : {bow}\\") print(f'We found {len(word_index)} unique tokens.') print_bow(sentence)  Hashing trick  A common alternative to using dictionaries is the hashing trick, where words are mapped directly to indices with a hashing function. Thus, no memory is required to store a dictionary. Hash collisions are typically dealt via freed- up memory to increase the number of hash buckets. In practice, hashing simplifies the implementation of bag-of-words models and improves scalability.  Example usage: spam filtering  In Bayesian spam filtering, an e-mail message is modeled as an unordered collection of words selected from one of two probability distributions: one representing spam and one representing legitimate e-mail (\\"ham\\"). Imagine there are two literal bags full of words. One bag is filled with words found in spam messages, and the other with words found in legitimate e-mail. While any given word is likely to be somewhere in both bags, the \\"spam\\" bag will contain spam-related words such as \\"stock\\", \\"Viagra\\", and \\"buy\\" significantly more frequently, while the \\"ham\\" bag will contain more words related to the user's friends or workplace. To classify an e-mail message, the Bayesian spam filter assumes that the message is a pile of words that has been poured out randomly from one of the two bags, and uses Bayesian probability to determine which bag it is more likely to be in.

A friend and colleague of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, he played an important role in the Bengal Renaissance. He was one of the most eminent Bengalis in Kolkata of the nineteenth century. Biography = Personal life = Mahesh Chandra Nyayratna Bhattacharyya, who was one of the most distinguished Sanskrit scholars in India, was born on 22 February 1836 to a Kulin Brahmin family of the highest rank, the Bhattacharyya family of Narit, which has long been distinguished for the zealous cultivation of Sanskrit learning, and the number of learned Pandits it has produced. His father, Harinarayan Tarkasiddhanta, and his two uncles, Guruprasad Tarkapanchanan and Thakurdas Churamani, were eminent Pandits. His elder brother, Pandit Madhab Chandra Sarbabhauma, was the Sabha Pandit of Mahishadal Raj. In 1848, he married Mandakini, the daughter of Pandit Ram Chand Tarkabagis, in Jehanabad, Hooghly. He had a daughter, Manorama, and three sons – Manmatha Nath Vidyaratna Bhattacharyya, MA (first Indian Accountant General of Madras), born April 1863, Munindra Nath Bhattacharyya, MA, BL (Vakil of the High Court of Calcutta), born February 1868 and Mahima Nath Bhattacharyya, BA (first Indian Collector in the Excise Department, Government of India), born April 1870. He died at the age of 70 on 12 April 1906. =Career in academia= He succeeded Prasanna Kumar Sarbadhikary as the principal of the Sanskrit College in 1876. During his 19-year tenure as principal he took the initiative of introducing the Sanskrit Title Examination, for the conferment of titles on meritorious students of special departments of Sanskrit learning. He started a secondary Anglo- Sanskrit school at his native village of Narit, that exists till date as Narit Nyayratna Institution. =Written work= He edited, with copious notes, Kavya Prakas, Mimansa Darshan and the Black Yajur Veda. He wrote numerous pamphlets, such as Remarks on Dayananda Saravati's Veda-Bhashya, Tulasidharan Mimansa, The Authorship of Mrichchhakatika and Lupta Samvatsara. Swami Dayanand eminent Vedic scholar replied doubts raised by Maheshchandra NyayaRatan by publishing a book name Bhranti Nivarana in 1880.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid;=sites&srcid;=dmVkaWNncmFudGgub3JnfHd3d3xneDo2NjkxMjhlZmVkMzk4YzVj He achieved notably in the general advancement of Sanskrit learning and also, by financial aid and otherwise, in furtherance of famine relief, the promotion of education and opening out means of communication. =Philanthropy= He not only greatly improved roads and infrastructure in and around Narit, but also took a leading role in developing roads and infrastructure, including tramways, in his native district of Howrah. =Honours and titles= The title of Mahamahopadhyay was conferred as a personal distinction on 16 February 1887, on the occasion of the Jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria, for eminence in oriental learning. It entitled him to take rank in the Durbar immediately after titular Rajas. Mahesh Chandra Nyayratna was made a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) on 24 May 1881 and the estimation with which Indian scholars held him is marked by the title of Nyayratna. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Budapest. He was a member of the Bengal Asiatic Society, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, the University of Calcutta, the Board of Examiners, the Central Text Book Committee of Bengal, the Behar Sanskrit Samaj and the Anthropological Society of Bombay. He was a Joint- Secretary of the Hindu Hostel Committee, member of the Bethune College Committee and a Visitor at the Government Engineering College at Shibpur, Howrah. He was also in charge of Sanskrit education of the Bengal presidency, which comprised then, the present West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa states. Nyayratna Lane in Shyambazar (North Kolkata) is named after him. =Descendants= Many of his descendants have left their mark in the pages of Kolkata's rich history. Foremost among them was his eldest son, Manmatha Nath Vidyaratna Bhattacharyya. Manmatha Bhattacharyya Street in Shyambazar is named after him, the first Indian Accountant General of Madras. Manmatha Nath was a close friend and confidante of Swami Vivekananda who was based at his palatial establishment in Madras, when he toured South India.Wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 6/Conversations and Dialogues (Translated from the diary of a disciple)/XII Vivekananda kept in touch wit Manmatha Nath on a regular basis and wrote to him regularly from the USA.Wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 7/Epistles - Third Series/XXIII Mr. Bhattacharya Manmatha Nath's daughter was worshipped by Vivekananda as the Kumari, during the first ever Kumari Puja in 1901, at the historic Belur Math in Howrah.

Directional road signs in Luxembourg Road sign on M39 south of Tashkent, showing destinations as far away as Hamburg (Gamburg) and Karachi A direction sign, more fully defined as a direction, position, or indication sign by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, is any road sign used primarily to give information about the location of either the driver or possible destinations, and are considered a subset of the informative signs group. Direction signs are far more varied internationally than other classes of sign, as the Vienna Convention does not specify sizes, colours, symbols or positions of such signs. Direction signs are the oldest type of road sign; Plutarch writes about milestones being placed in the 3rd century BC, while some fingerposts in the United Kingdom date back to at least the 1690s. However, it was not until the invention of the motor car at the turn of the 20th century that modern direction signs evolved, with fewer words and clear design allowing them to be read at speed. History =Pre-automobile= A Prussian milestone c. 1836, reading \\"II MEILEN BIS BERLIN\\" (\\"two miles to Berlin\\"). The first direction signs were milestones on the Roman road network; finding one's location on the long, straight roads was difficult, and hence, large stones were placed at intervals along the roads, giving the distance in Roman miles to nearby major cities, and usually to the capitals of major provinces. As most Roman roads diverged from Rome, one of the numbers was usually the distance to the Milliarium Aureum, a large golden milestone in the centre of Rome, although sometimes other stones, such as the London Stone, were used in places where measuring distances from Rome was impossible or not useful. The use of milestones continued following the decline of the Roman Empire. However, as trading between towns and regions increased, milestones were found to be inconvenient for giving directions at crossroads. As a result, the fingerpost developed. Erected by local parishes, fingerposts were easier to read from horseback and were cheaper to make. With the development of the turnpike and the stagecoach, the Turnpike Roads Act 1773 was passed, making signposting compulsory to allow the riders to judge their speed and prevent them from becoming lost. Similar signs were developed in other countries and remained in use until the early-20th century, when development of the motor car made the small and often wordy signs impractical. A British fingerpost of the style used before modernisation. =Modernisation= An overhead sign showing the way to Kuwait City Most early direction signs were based on the traditional styles in use in area; the United Kingdom used adapted, cast iron fingerposts for signing directions, while the United States adopted an ad hoc scheme based on traditional trail markings. These proved unwieldy, and modernisation efforts quickly sprang up to change them. However, the changes faced opposition, both from traditionalists who preferred the style or charm of older signs, and from businesses along affected routes, which feared that standardised direction signs would favour the new highways, causing rural routes to fade into obscurity. The advent of World War II halted sign modernisation efforts across Europe, however, and governments removed direction signs from their road networks – fearing that they would assist enemy spies and/or invading forces. The end of the war, on the other hand, presented itself as an opportunity, seized by many European nations, to set about redeveloping their directional signage systems. The construction of high-speed motorways meant that traditional road signs were no longer practical, and so new, modern signs with bold, sans serif typefaces and diagrams indicating lanes and sliproads ahead were developed. The British Worboys Committee (established in 1963) went even further, creating signs with detailed diagrams of junction layouts. Such signs have now been in use almost unchanged for over half a century. Design The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals divides the direction, position, or indication sign category into direction signs, which are only those giving distances or directions to a given location; road identification signs (also known as \\"reassurance signs\\"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place identification signs, which give the name of a landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of sign, direction signs remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that direction signs must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, direction signs on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary direction signs are yellow or orange. As a result, different nations can have wildly different direction signs; the United States uses verbose green gantry signs almost universally in built up areas, with few diagrams beyond basic arrows,Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices 2003 edition while the United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland use signs with fewer words but detailed maps of the approaching junctions. Most areas use different colours to show different road types, but the implementation varies: the United Kingdom (and Ireland) uses full colour boards, colour-coded to match the type of road they are placed on, with relevant text highlighted within patches of other colours to indicate different road types using the Guildford Rules.Highway Code The United States, Canada, and Australia, as well as New Zealand on the other hand almost universally use the plain green signs, but some signs use different colours to highlight certain types of destination such as hospitals and rest stops, or, in Australia that the road is a tollway. Road signs in Israel and the Palestinian territories are of similar design to North American signage, but vary in color depending on whether the sign indicates direction for through traffic, exiting traffic, etc. Direction signs can also be used in conjunction with other types of sign: for example, in the United Kingdom, if a warning or prohibitory sign appears on a direction sign, it means that the route indicated by the sign contains the hazard or prohibition sign posted.

Some areas have special evacuation route signs that are to be followed in case of certain disasters. The signs point to routes either to safety or to less danger. Evacuation signs are common in areas where there is a high risk of dangers such as flash flooding, volcanic activity and lahar, tsunami, hurricane and storm surge. For example, along the Japanese shorelines, the tsunami warning signs are linked with a network of warning sirens, typically at the top of the cliff of surroundings hills.

When the Austrian summer offensive of 1917 routed the Italians, Cadorna's foresight saved Italy from total defeat, as the Austrians, with help from the German Army's Alpenkorps failed to take the mountain's summit during the first battle of Monte Grappa from November 11, 1917 to December 23, 1917. Thus, the Italian front along the Piave river was stabilized and, although the Austrians could see Venice from their positions, they would never reach it. Italian casualties totaled 12,000 and Austrian casualties 21,000.Silvestri, Mario. (2006). Caporetto, una battaglia e un enigma. Bur, Bergamo. . The second battle of Monte Grappa was complementary to the wider Austrian summer offensive of 1918, which was the last offensive operation of the Austro–Hungarian Army in World War I. The third battle of Monte Grappa started on October 24, 1918, as part of the final Italian offensive of the war, when 9 Italian divisions attacked the Austrian positions on Monte Grappa. The Austrians answered by increasing their forces on the mountain from 9 to 15 divisions and thus committing all remaining reserves. But the worn down Austrian Army began a general retreat on October 28, when Czechoslovakia declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Popular culture Monte Grappa appears in Electronic Arts' 2016 first-person shooter video game title Battlefield 1 as a multiplayer map. The map is set during the final Italian offensive in the Third Battle of Monte Grappa pitting Austro-Hungarian forces against the Kingdom of Italy. The map is part of the \\"Iron Walls\\" operation set during the 1918 Italian offensive. The map also appears in the game as part of the singleplayer campaign under the name Avanti Savoia!

It has a varied cultural tradition ranging from the Arthurian legends to The Wurzels, a band specialising in Scrumpy and Western music. The west front of Wells Cathedral Art, music and literature Traditional folk music, both song and dance, was important in Somerset's agrarian communities. Somerset songs were collected by Cecil Sharp and incorporated into a number of works including Holst's A Somerset Rhapsody. Halsway Manor near Williton is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with groups such as The Wurzels, who specialise in Scrumpy and Western music. The number of Morris dance sides declined drastically following the First World War, but saw a resurgence during the 1950s, and Morris dancing is now a common sight at events throughout the summer. Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote while staying in Coleridge Cottage, Nether Stowey. The writer Evelyn Waugh spent his last years in the village of Combe Florey. The novelist John Cowper Powys (1872-1963) lived in the Somerset village of Montacute from 1885 until 1894 and his novels Wood and Stone (1915) and A Glastonbury Romance (1932) are set in Somerset. His brothers, T. F. Powys and Llewelyn Powys, were also successful writers. Many traditional rural trades such as basket making have survived, and many other crafts such as jewelry, leatherwork and pottery can be found at studios around the county. An annual competition for the Bard of Bath aims to find Bath's best poet, singer or storyteller. The Bard uses the title to develop artistic projects in the area and leads evening bardic walks around the city. The title resurrects an Iron-Age Celtic Druid tradition where Druids were the law-makers, judges and ceremonial leaders, Ovates were mediums, healers and prophets and Bards were poets, musicians and history-keepers. All of them held high status and a place in mystical/religious circles. Theatres Theatre Royal, Bath Bath has the greatest number of theatres in the county. The oldest is the Theatre Royal which was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was Beau Nash's first house: The theatre, along with the neighbouring Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered a prime example of Georgian architecture. The auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with sumptuous red and gilt decoration, and a majestic trompe l'oeil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It was extensively renovated in 1982, and refurbished in 1999 and now provides a 900-seat auditorium. The Ustinov Studio, a studio theatre is the Theatre Royal's second space, built in 1997 at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street. It is named after the actor Peter Ustinov. It is the home of Britain's largest annual international festival of adult puppetry, and a venue for an eclectic range of drama, dance and classical music. In 2006 it closed for a £1.5million, 15-month refurbishment undertaken by Haworth Tompkins. Also connected to the Theatre Royal is the egg which was built specifically for the use of young people. It was converted from a former cinema by architects Haworth Tompkins. The Grade II listed Victorian building houses the eponymous 'egg'-shaped auditorium, around which an arts cafe, rooftop rehearsal space and basement technical workshop are arranged. The idea was supported by the children's author Bel Mooney. It opened in October 2005. In 2007, the Peter Hall Company made use of the space in order to stage a production of George Orwell's Animal Farm. The auditorium is unique in the UK enabling both fully day-lit or blacked out theatre and is usable end-on, in the round, flat floor and traverse. In 2004, the Next Stage Theatre Company took possession of a grade II listed building in Bath originally built as a Congregational hall in 1797, which had been used by The People's Mission until 1998, and began building work to convert it into the Mission Theatre. It is now owned by the Bath and North East Somerset Council, which has granted a lease to occupy and use the building as a 100-seat theatre, arts centre and multi-purpose facility for community activities. On the first floor there is a small 30-seat theatre (The Theatre Upstairs) and a Bistro open during the day and providing meals before performances in the theatre. The Rondo Theatre, which was established in 1989, is located in the former church hall of St. Saviours Church, Larkhall. The building, purchased in 1976 by Doreen and Wilf Williams, has been converted into a 105-seat theatre. The facility received extensive renovations and upgrades after the receipt of lottery grants in 1996 and 2003. Brewhouse Theatre, Taunton The Blakehay Theatre in Weston-super-Mare was originally built in 1850 as Wadham Street Baptist Church. During World War II the theatre was hit by incendiary bombs. After the war it was rebuilt inside the original Victorian shell. In 1985 the building ceased to be a place of worship. In 1986 the Blakehay was saved from demolition by the Weston- super-Mare Building Trust and run by the Civic Society. In September 2004 Weston Town Council purchased the theatre for £195,000. Also in Weston is The Playhouse a 664-seat theatre that hosts a largely entertainment based programme of shows all year round including opera, ballet, comedy, music and pantomime performances. In 1946, an old market building, designed by local architect Hans Price, was converted into a 500-seat theatre. For the next 18 years this theatre, The Playhouse, provided the town with a great variety of entertainment and played host to stars including Frankie Howerd, Bob Monkhouse and Ken Dodd. On 21 August 1964, a fire destroyed most of the theatre and the unsafe structure had to be demolished. In 1969, at a cost of £230,000 a new theatre opened and has been in continuous use ever since. The stage measures by and can be extended by covering the orchestra pit. The Brewhouse Theatre on the banks of the River Tone in Taunton, opened in March 1977, and now offers a 350-seat auditorium and supporting studio and exhibition spaces. Strode Theatre in Street is part of Strode College and provides rehearsal and drama space for students from the college. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. There are two theatres in Frome: The Memorial Theatre was built in 1924 in memory of the fallen of the First World War, whilst the 240-seat Merlin Theatre is part of the Community College campus. Festivals \\"Samurai\\" by Griffens CC, at Burnham on Sea Carnival 2006, part of the West Country Carnival circuit The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts takes place most years in Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, attracting over 170,000 music and culture lovers and entertainers from around the world. The Big Green Gathering was held in Somerset on five occasions between 2002 and 2007. The annual Bath Literature Festival is one of several local festivals in the county which include the Frome Festival and the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival, which, despite its name, is held at Farleigh Hungerford in Somerset. Sand Sculpture at Weston- super-Mare Sand Sculpture Festival of A Midsummer Nights Dream The annual circuit of West Country Carnivals is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn, forming a major regional festival, and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe. It is an annual celebration featuring a parade of illuminated floats (termed \\"carts\\" locally), in the English West Country. The celebration dates back to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The series of parades in each town now form a major regional festival. Some carts cost in excess of £20,000 to build and are the result of thousands of man hours work throughout the year. The event's purpose, as it has always been from the start, is to raise thousands of pounds for local charities from money collection carts in the two-hour procession. In several villages Punkie Night is celebrated each October. Many villages had Friendly Societies or Clubs between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. The use of Friendly Society Brasses as emblems was particularly prevalent in Somerset and the surrounding counties. The Weston- super-Mare Sand Sculpture Festival is held annually on the beach at Weston- super-Mare. The Bridgwater Science Festival is held each year in the Town Hall and other venues in Bridgwater. Legends and religion Glastonbury Tor According to Arthurian legend, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen. What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700. It claims to be \\"the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World\\" by dating the founding of the community of monks to AD 63, the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea, who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail to England. During the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey. The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset and a small area of Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now located in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having been previously based at Bath Abbey. Before the English Reformation, it was a Roman Catholic diocese. There is also a Benedictine monastery, Saint Gregory's Abbey (commonly known as Downside Abbey), at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and a Cistercian Cleeve Abbey near the village of Washford. Culbone Church is the smallest English parish church still holding services. Many legends exist about Somerset. The Stanton Drew stone circles are said to have been formed when a wedding party continued to dance on the Lord's day. Likewise the Witch of Wookey Hole is said to have been turned to stone by a priest. The Norton Fitzwarren Dragon is just one of many stories about dragons in Somerset. After a battle a dragon was formed from the pile of corpses and it began terrorising the area by devouring children and destroying crops. A young man took on the beast and after a long and bloody struggle, he pierced the dragons heart and cut off its head. In All Saints Church, a sixteenth-century rood screen depicts the story. Museums and art galleries Tyntesfield. There are a number of museums and art galleries in the county, several of which are in Bath.

Early life She was born as Masa Naganuma on December 25, 1889 in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.http://rk-world.org/cofounder.aspx At the age of sixteen she was adopted by her older sister, but soon left for Tokyo. In Tokyo she found work as a maid, but later worked in an army munitions factory.Lifetime Beginner: An Autobiography, Nikkyō Niwano, Pages 89-90 Soon she fell ill and went to live with her uncle in the country. She later married and had a daughter, but the child died at age two. Myoko divorced her husband because he mishandled their money and moved back to Tokyo. In Tokyo she married again and opened a food stand to make money, selling ice and sweet baked potatoes. She fell ill very often and hemorrhaged many times. It was at this time she encountered Mr. Nikkyō Niwano and he began to give religious guidance to her. Her second husband however, was unable to deal with her new beliefs and soon left her. He would later marry a member of Risshō Kōsei Kai and receive guidance from Ms. Naganuma.Lifetime Beginner: An Autobiography, Nikkyo Niwano, Page 90 Involvement in Risshō Kōsei Kai Ms. Naganuma had met Mr. Nikkyō Niwano because he delivered milk to her house. At this time she was sickly and he encouraged her to put faith in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra and to practice Reiyūkai Buddhism.Lifetime Beginner: An Autobiography She did and her health improved, after this she began to work with Mr. Niwano in the missionary field. The two became close friends, despite the age difference between the two, Ms. Naganuma being seventeen years his senior. In 1938 the two attended a Reiyūkai meeting where the leadership made comments about the Lotus Sutra being outdated. Both agreed that they could not belong to a group that held such views. They decided to found Risshō Kōsei Kai and on March 5, 1938 held the founding meeting at Mr. Niwano's house. She became the Vice-President and was known for being able to receive messages from the spirit world and being very devoted to the faith. She supported Rev. Niwano and Risshō Kōsei Kai, traveling with him and giving guidance to members. Illness, Death and legacy In later years her health worsened.

In the mid-1980s, two developers, Robert Landau and Douglas Cohen, operating under an array of names, including Les Galleria Dorchester and Grinch Realties, purchased a series of buildings in an area bounded by Overdale Avenue, Lucien L'Allier Street, Mackay Street and Dorchester Boulevard (Dorchester was renamed as René Lévesque Boulevard in 1987). The developers proposed to demolish all of the homes and replace them with a large condo project. The Executive Committee of Montreal, headed by Mayor Jean Doré, was split on the issue. Doré had risen to power through the Montreal Citizens' Movement (known in French as the Rassemblement des citoyens et des citoyennes de Montréal, or RCM). The MCM had considered the defense of tenants' rights to be among its primary goals. Doré had promised to change the demolitionist ways of his predecessor, Mayor Jean Drapeau, but when developers promised a project that would yield significant municipal tax dollars, Doré decided to allow the project to evict the tenants of the homes and demolish buildings that housed 87 residents. The buildings to be demolished included many fine, Victorian-era structures as well as the onetime home of Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine. Tenants and experts argued that the terrain was large enough to allow for the construction of the new project alongside the existing structures, yet the appeals were rejected. City inspectors condemned the buildings as electrical hazards. The tenants were ordered out, saving the landlords the inconvenience of negotiating the departure of each individual tenant. In spite of protests and arrests and considerable public reaction in opposition to the planned project and the methods employed to evict the tenants, the buildings, except for the onetime home of Lafontaine, were demolished in 1989. The promised $100-million condominium development was not built for decades and remained a parking lot until 2015, when construction started. The developers paid the city to build a separate building farther from downtown which would be offered to the evicted tenants. The rents were much higher at the new development. The Overdale-area residents were invited to move to the new project, but most refused. Timeline This is a chronological summary of the events that involved in the Overdale controversy, based on the notes of architect Michael Fish. =1986= Summer: The Doria Corporation, owner of all the residential properties on the block (Mackay, Dorchester, Lucien-L’Allier, Overdale) applies for demolition permits for all of the housing on the block. There are 75 apartments and studio-rooms within a greystone rooming house, a three- storey apartment building, four triplexes, a mansion converted into apartments and 7 grey stone former grand homes converted into apartments. The average space in all units is 48 sq. m. The Canadian census tract covering this block of houses notes that the median income of the households is $8,000 per annum. The next lowest census tract on the island covers the Dozois project where the median income is $11,000 dollars per annum. Fall: The City Executive under Mayor Drapeau decides to refuse permission to demolish any buildings. The decision of the Executive Committee notes that all the buildings have been inspected by city experts who that all of the buildings are in good condition. Furthermore, experts representing the province who have also looked at the proposal to demolish them state that all of the buildings have a certain heritage value, that they are feasible to renovate, where desired, at economic cost, that they can be easily integrated into any further development and recommends that the city conserve all the buildings. Residents protest in November. Winter: Cohen and Landau, having purchased the nonresidential and vacant property on the block, buy the all the residential property to become the sole proprietor of the block. There are some 13000 sq meters of land on the whole block. They attest to having paid $11,000,000 for the whole block. Together with a source close to the Doré group, Cameron Charlebois, Cohen and Landau ask the newly-elected executive committee member, John Gardiner, for rezonings on the block for a massive redevelopment. Gardiner agrees to allow Cohen and Landau to build two new small apartment buildings, to be owned by the city, on a cost-plus basis on some vacant city owned land a few blocks away. The land is valued at $235,000. The developers offer in kind up to $1.1 million toward their construction cost over any mortgages negotiated for them. They pledge up to $135,000 to help pay rental subsidies to the residents when and if they move. The city agree to pay all mortgages of these buildings estimated to amount to at least $1.25 million, and contribute temporary subsidies to the rents for displaced residents of up to $135,000. The total city contribution to the developers is valued at: land, $235,000; rent subsidies, $135,000; and mortgage guarantee, at least $1.25 million; streets and lanes, $207,000; and a plus value to the site of $1.88 million, totalling at least $3.7 million. Cohen and Landau pledge up to $1.1 million for the cost of the new buildings and $135,000 toward rental subsidies if residents move to the new buildings. The total is a maximum of $1.24 million. There will be 67 rooms and apartments in the new buildings replacing the 75 existing rooms and apartments in the existing buildings. =1987= June: Gardiner announces Cohen and Landau's proposal for development and the \\"generous gesture\\" of developers to replace the demolished homes. He claims a \\"first\\" in the \\"protection\\" of the resident-tenants by the city. Gardiner starts negotiations with the Overdale residents on behalf of the developers to get them to move quickly to the new buildings. He promises Councillor Arnold Bennett and other housing activists close to his municipal party that rents will not rise in the new buildings from the low levels in the Overdale buildings. July: Residents point out that the rents offered to most of them are 40% higher in the new buildings and that the subsidies slide down to nothing in the fourth year. The residents become divided among themselves under heavy continuous pressure from their landlords, city officials, lobbyists, and the media. Elderly poor residents of the rooming house agree to the proposal to move, and a few other older and sick residents leave the area to avoid the stress of a protracted fight. Some residents feel that the temporary rental subsidies offered to everyone can be improve, and even made permanent. They continue to negotiate unsuccessfully with Gardiner. Public comment in major media, newspapers, radio, and television go strongly, even rabidly against the residents in support of the vity and the developers. The local city councillor, and Montreal Gazette columnist, Nick Auf der Maur, writes an article for the Montreal Daily News attacking the residents as greedy. The article is reprinted in the Gazette as a paid advertisement. Architect Michael Fish is asked by the residents to study the possibility of staying in their homes, purchasing them for their market worth and helping increase the profitability of the developers plans. One home is found by Senator Serge Joyal to be the former home of Louis Hippolyte-Lafontaine, an important Patriot during the 1837-38 Rebellion. The historic value of the building is enhanced by the facts that Lafontaine later served as the first prime minister of the United Canadas 1848-1851. Nevertheless, demolition application notices are put up on all buildings. Several appeals to the Commission d'arbitrage against demolition are launched. Cohen and Landau withdraw the application to demolish the Lafontaine house \\"provided it is proved that it is indeed the house of Lafontaine.\\" August: Negotiations between the residents and the City continue. Transition funds (damages owed under the rental code) to those who agree to leave quickly are slowly negotiated up to $3,000 per apartment tenant and $1,400 per roomer to leave quickly. Few residents take the money. Public hearings are announced. The City Executive Committee announces their own revised intention to preserve four buildings on MacKay Street, the Lafontaine house and four triplexes on Overdale Street. It will allow the demolition of the Kinkora-Cadillac Apts and all the greystone houses on Kinkora Avenue. The hearings open for two evenings before a committee of City Councillors. September: A report of the City Council Committee recommends saving of all the buildings and the \\"integration of residents into the condo development,\\" with a smaller scale new building to take certain residents who would not be part of a coop on the site. Only Councillor Nick Auf der Maur dissents, calling the report by the Committee \\"crazy.\\" The City Council votes against the almost- unanimous report of its own committee and accepts the development plan worked out by Gardiner. Four councillors vote against the majority of the city council. Several others abstain, including the powerful chairman of the Committee, Councillor André Lavallée. Several councillors in the Doré party sit from then on as independents. October: The residents demonstrate for the first time against the council's decision and ask questions at city council. Residents will come to almost every council meeting during the next months to demonstrate and to ask for changes to keep them in their homes. November: Residents demonstrate at the MCM convention. Delegates vote to maintain the program of the party, which calls for the integration of buildings and residents into new developments except when such is cost prohibitive. The City Executive Committee directs its Heritage Committee to cite as a historic monument the Lafontaine house and its immediate grey Ssone triplex neighbour, originally built as an extension to the Lafontaine house. The Heritage Committee holds hearings. Objections by the architects of the development, represented by architect Panzini are sustained by the committee. Only the Lafontaine house is cited by the city as cultural property. =1988= January 13: Hearings open before the Commission d'arbitrage sur la demolition du patrimoine residentiel de Montreal to decide the question of whether the Kinkora-Cadillac apartments and the Kinkora St. greystone buildings are to be demolished. March 16: A Superior Court Judge orders work stopped for a period of 10 days while the issue can be sorted out. April: Cohen and Landau are issued permits by the city to convert all buildings that will be ordered preserved by the Commission d'arbitrage from residences to commercial and offices. The tactic allows allows residents to be legally removed from all buildings immediately, even those that will be ordered conserved. The permission documents note that the Lafontaine house, with its stone extension, and the Mackay Street row will become a community centre with a fitness club and offices. Such permits usually take months to approve. These are approved in nine days. Intense demolition work starts immediately on vacant buildings and in vacant apartments despite that some tenants have valid leases to occupy their apartments. Six more residents or supporters are arrested and jailed for a day for blocking workers from this work. They will ultimately be criminalized. An injunction is obtained by the residents from Superior Court to stop this work. Mayor Doré calls the work \\"premature and provocative.\\" May: The Commission d'Arbitrage decides to recommend approving all the demolitions applied for. The federal Minister of housing, McInnes announces a 100% increase in the number of very low income residents who can live in a nonprofit co-op. The feasibility of a co-op on the Overdale site is improved allowing for an increase in the offer to Cohen and Landau. Superior Court hearings start for a permanent injunction requested by the residents to set the conversion permits aside on the grounds that the zoning bylaw that calls for only residences on the block is being contravened by the issue of commercial permits. Faults in the permit drawings and processes are alleged. Residents form a nonprofit co-op and apply for a charter from the province. June: The coop offers $700,000 for the buildings again, almost twice what was paid for their value as condos by Landau and Cohen, leaving the surplus land development rights for the whole block. Since the buildings will be demolished by the developers, this is a land transaction that an intelligent developer could not turn down. However it is refused. A letter written by the mayor and Gardiner supports the co-op application to senior governments as a part of the condo development. June 14: The city fire department orders an evacuation of the buildings on MacKay Street and of the Kinkora-Cadillac Apartments, citing minor dangerous conditions of the buildings. June 21: Mayor Doré refuses to try to persuade the developers to sell their homes to the co-op. He defends the arrangements as they are. June 22: The residents are refused permits to correct the \\"dangerous conditions\\" in the buildings on their own at their own cost. June 27: Remaining residents of the condemned buildings barricade themselves into their apartments. June 28: Six more residents and their supporters are arrested by the police for blocking city movers from the buildings and are evacuated force. Thirteen residents are arrested and jailed overnight in an all-morning police operation involving the riot squad, the SWAT team, and a platoon of 20 to 30 police to empty the buildings. A later trial orders several residents and sentences them to stay away from all demonstrations for two years. June 29: Mayor Doré defends the use of force against the residents. July: Residents continue to try to persuade Landau, Cohen, and Doré to sell their home for a 100% profit to their co-op as part of the condo development. In the meantime, developers have $3.7 million in city donated benefits for $1.6 million in developer concessions to a publicly owned project open only to middle class tenancy. September: The following buildings are demolished. All that remain are three facades on Mackay Street, the Lafontaine house, its grey stone extension, and three brick triplexes fronting on Overdale. All have been gutted for offices that never materialize, the whole of the rest of the city block is covered with gravel, and a parking lot operates ever since. Fall: The Superior Court refuses to intervene to stop demolition. There will be no appeal. Winter: The Lafontaine house and its extensions have their insides ripped out and removed for offices. Weeks later, the collapse occurs. =1991= September: Fires are set in the truncated houses on Mackay Street. There is now little left of the street's protected houses on to demolish. That happens a week later. The brick triplexes on Overdale are already gone, unprotested, replaced by more parking space. October: A $200,000-bond required by Cohen and Landau to guarantee new construction, required by their rezoning and permission to demolish, is due but goes unpaid. =1992= May 22: An exhibition of art relating to the fight to preserve the homes of Overdale is opened in the Concordia University art gallery. =2001= A squat to draw attention to poverty and the housing crisis in Montreal occupies the Lafontaine house for several weeks. =2006= Winter: The mature Kentucky coffeetrees cut back a few years earlier, in front of the Lafontaine house are cut down, their roots pulled up. Spring: Several big-name celebrated Canadians from across the country ask for something to be done about the Lafontaine house. They suggest turning the house into a museum. June: Fish asks Mayor Gérald Tremblay to step in and at least to homologate the property around the Lafontaine House immediately. The request is shunted off to the local mayor of the arrondissement. Senator Serge Joyal. Lise Bacon and Phyllis Lambert ask the Federal Monuments Commission to declare the house a federal historic site. The Commission of Federal Monuments refuses so to do. They then apply to the Provincial Monuments Commission to classify the House. The Commission refuses but agrees to reconsider. Jean Francois Lisée, Jacques Monet, and other noted historians urge the classification of the building by the province in local newspapers. They invoke the crucial historic importance of Lafontaine to Canada and to the survival of French speaking people in North America. August: Alan Hustak of The Gazette writes an article about the house in which several interested groups are quoted as wanting the house used for a public interpretation centre. An editorial the next day states that people wanting that should just purchase the property. Landau, the owner, says that the site is worth $50 million. Aftermath Several prominent and longtime MCM councilors were outraged by the decision to allow the project and quit the party.Montreal Mirror They included Sam Boskey, Marvin Rotrand and Marcel Sevigny. The MCM suffered a split from which it would never recover. Doré and the MCM were voted out of office in 1994. Since 1992, a new City Master Plan has been written for the whole city. The Overdale frontage allows 25 m buildings.

The Italians had decided to launch another offensive on the Soča (Isonzo) River. Background After four attempts to cross the Soča (Isonzo) river and invade Austro- Hungarian territory, Luigi Cadorna, the Italian commander-in-chief, organized a strong new offensive following the winter lull in fighting which had allowed the Italian High Command to regroup and organize 8 new divisions for the front. However, it was an offensive launched not after detailed strategic planning, but rather as a distraction to shift the Central Powers away from the Eastern Front and from Verdun, where the greatest bloodshed of the war was occurring. The attack was a result of the allied Chantilly Conference of December 1915. The battle The attacks ordered by Cadorna for the 2nd and 3rd Italian Armies as \\"demonstrations\\" against the enemy, proved to be less bloody than those previously. The battles were fought on the Karst plateau, with the objective of taking Gorizia and the Tolmin bridgehead. The Italians were able to conquer Mount Sabatino from the Austro-Hungarians, but that was the only real gain they had made. After a week of fighting that cost the lives of 4,000 men between both sides, the clashes ceased because of the terrible weather conditions that worsened the trench conditions and because of the Austro-Hungarian \\"punitive\\" offensive in the Trentino. Along certain parts of the front, especially around Gorizia, skirmishes continued between enemy platoons until March 30 and beyond, in a protracted struggle that produced no clear victor. Cadorna had called upon his Russian allies to keep the Austria- Hungarian units at bay on the Eastern front given Cadorna the chance to redeploy his forces at Trentino all the while abandoning the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo. Aftermath With the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo over the Italians now had to plan another assault. Cadorna put his sixth offensive on the drawing board after hearing promises of resupply from Italy's Allies.

She was launched in 1893 and sold in 1909 for scrapping. Although the torpedo boat destroyers were ordered first, Havock and Hornet were completed faster, making them the first destroyers ever built. Design and construction In April 1892, the British Admiralty sent out a request to several shipbuilders for designs and tenders for \\"large sea going torpedo boats\\", or what later became known as \\"torpedo boat destroyers\\". In July 1892, it was decided to place an order with the two specialised torpedo-boat builders, Yarrows and Thornycroft for two ships each, with Yarrows' two ships named and Hornet. While both Yarrow ships were powered by triple-expansion steam engines driving two shafts, they differed in the boilers used, with Havock using 2 conventional locomotive-type fire-tube boilers while Hornet used 8 Yarrow water tube boilers. (This resulted in Havock having 2 funnels while Hornet was fitted with 4 funnels). Gun armament consisted of a single 12 pounder () gun, three 6 pounder (57 mm) guns, while torpedo armament consisted of three 18 in (450 mm) torpedo tubes, with one fixed bow tube and two deck mounted tubes, with the two deck-mounted tubes in a single rotating mounting, pointing in opposite directions, so that enemies on either beam could be attacked at the same time. History Hornet was laid down at Yarrow's Poplar, London yard on 1 July 1892. Hornets water tube boilers meant that it took longer to build than Havock, launching on 23 December 1893 and completed in July 1894. The ship's performance during trials was generally successful, with only slight vibration noted and the ship steering well, and an average speed of being made over a three-hour trial. Hornet served almost all her service life in Home waters, although she did serve briefly in the Mediterranean in 1900. Hornets bow structure was strengthened in 1901. While the bow torpedo tube was found to be of little use, as it adversely affected seakeeping and restricted space forward, with fears that the ship could over-run a torpedo fired from the bow tube, Hornet retained the bow tube, while the two deck mounted tubes were removed by 1902. In February 1902 she was ordered to replace as tender to , special service vessel, for duties in connection with the Sheerness School of Gunnery. She took part in the Coronation Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902, with Lieutenant W. B. W. Grubb temporarily in command from 8 August. In late October 1902 she was at Sheerness dockyard for a refit. Fate A survey in February 1909 found that Hornets hull was in poor condition, with buckling of the hull plating and estimated repair costs of £4,050. She was sold on 12 October 1909 for scrapping.

Boston and the history of biomagnetism. Neurology & Clinical Neurophysiology Nov 30; 2004: 114. although he was initially trained as a nuclear physicist. Early life and education Cohen was born of immigrant parents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He was raised there and earned a B.A. degree at the University of Manitoba. Then, he attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, where he gained a Ph.D. in experimental nuclear physics. Career Working in this area, and using large magnets, he became interested in the other extreme; this was the measurement of very weak magnetic fields, which for example might be produced by the weak natural currents in the human body. In 1963, he proposed a method using a magnetically shielded room to keep out external magnetic disturbances, as in radiation shielding in nuclear experiments. At that time others reported the first biomagnetic measurement, where the MCG (magnetocardiogram, the magnetic field due to heart currents) was measured; this was done without shielding, hence showed much external interference. Cohen then built a modest shielded room, and with somewhat clearer signals verified the heart’s magnetic field. He also made the first measurement of the MEG (magnetoencephalogram, the magnetic field of the brain). However, all these early biomagnetic measurements were generally too noisy, both because of the use of insensitive detectors, and incomplete magnetic shielding. To obtain clearer results, in 1969 Cohen built an elaborate shielded room at MIT, but still needed a more sensitive detector. James Zimmerman had just developedZimmerman JE, Theine P, and Harding JT. Design and operation of stable rf-biased superconducting point-contact quantum devices, etc. Journal of Applied Physics 1970; 41:1572-1580. an extremely sensitive detector called the SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device).

Upon the election of U.S. Grant to the U.S. Presidency (1869–1877), Henson became the first Special Secret Service Agent of the United States of America, serving until Grant's death in 1885. During the course of his life and careers, Philip Henson would interact with such famous 19th century persons as abolitionist John Brown, Cherokee Chiefs John Ross a.k.a. Kooweskoowe and Stand Watie a.k.a. Degataga, Tennessee and Texas Governor Sam Houston, actor John Wilkes Booth, Confederate Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan, Confederate Secretary of State Judah Philip Benjamin, U.S. Congressman from Illinois Elihu Benjamin Washburne, Union General and Transcontinental Railroad executive Grenville Mellen Dodge, New York political boss William Marcy Tweed, Medal of Honor recipient First Lieutenant Nineveh S. McKeen, and the ancestors of 20th century Hollywood legend Cecil B. DeMille. History Henson was born in Blount Springs, Alabama. At an early age he would accompany his father, a Federal Indian Agent, on his travels to Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. Upon his father's death in 1839, Henson, at twelve (12) years of age, left home to work as a mail carrier for U.S. Government contractor Daniel Seavers, a herder for Edwards and Cornelius, and an overseer for Thomas Turnbow in order to help support his widowed mother and siblings. He would not return home until 1859 after leading a settlement expedition to the Mesilla Valley (now New Mexico) where he earned the rank of Captain which was conferred upon him by the grateful company of settlers. On the eve of the American Civil War, Henson was working as a storekeeper and living with his wife Celestine Rachel in Corinth, Mississippi. Just as he was about to have to work once again as an overseer for planter Moore McCauley in order that he'd be exempt from serving in the Confederate army, Alabama Governor A.B. Moore and Montgomery Mayor A.J. Noble appointed him Captain of the State's Militia and the Confederacy's Postmaster General, John Henninger Reagan selected him for the position of Field Supervisor in the Confederate Post Office Department. As a result, he resumed traveling throughout the Southwest. During the course of his travels he revisited former Texas Governor Houston, who'd been removed from office upon his refusal to take an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy. Houston presented Henson with a life changing proposition: become a scout and spy for the Union. He was sent by Houston to Illinois to meet with U.S. Congressman Washburne and a little known Union Colonel named Grant who was \\"killing time\\" drilling and recruiting Illinois Volunteers. Henson swore an oath of loyalty to the Union, because, as he'd attest to whenever asked about it, \\"I believed in it\\". Thus began a twenty five-year relationship between the two men that would see them move together from Civil War battlefields to the White House. Career as a scout and spy during the Civil War Henson's career as a Union scout and spy commenced in earnest when he had a fateful meeting with Confederate General Leonidas Polk, who was known as \\"The Fighting Bishop\\" due to the fact that before the war Polk was the Episcopalian Bishop of Louisiana. Polk informed Henson that Confederate Generals Gideon Johnson Pillow and John Buchanan Floyd were in command of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, respectively. Henson in turn advised Grant of Polk's admission that two \\"political\\" Generals were in charge of defending the two key forts. Shortly thereafter, Grant would earn his nickname \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" when he recorded the first two victories of the war for the Union as a result of his taking advantage of the inferior skill sets of both Pillow and Floyd to win the Battles of Forts Henry and Donelson in 1862. Unfortunately for both Henson and Grant, the war made its way to Corinth which prevented Henson from warning Grant in advance about the \\"surprise attack\\" Confederate Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard planned for him at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. The resulting bloodbath would become known as the Battle of Shiloh, and Grant would find himself with an unwanted nickname, \\"The Butcher\\". It was after Shiloh, when Grant, Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, Grenville Mellen Dodge, and Colonel John Aaron Rawlins finally arrived in a by then evacuated Corinth, during a meeting with Henson in attendance, that the subject of a scorched earth policy and the topic of total war was first discussed. Also, at this time, Henson in response to requests from Andrew Jackson Hamilton and Charles Christopher Sheats would introduce the Southern Unionists known as \\"The Mossbacks of Nickajack\\" to Grant, resulting in the enlistment of over 2,000 loyal Alabamians in the 1st Alabama Cavalry US Volunteers. Later on during the war, they were picked by General Sherman to serve as his escort during his March to the Sea. The following year Henson made his way to Vicksburg, Mississippi to gather information on the Confederate forces in the city. Much to Grant's good fortune he managed to convince Confederate General John C. Pemberton (the CSA commander of the city) to take him into his confidence. Henson gave Pemberton misinformation in regards to the purported inhumane treatment Confederate prisoners of war were supposedly receiving from their Union captors. Pemberton then had him share his story with the troops within Vicksburg in the hope of \\"stirring the Southern soul\\" which in turn gave him free run of the entire city. The information he garnered, including details about the city's canals, was ultimately utilized by Grant in the successful siege and subsequent surrender of Vicksburg in 1863 which would further Grant's celebrity as the \\"thinking man's General\\". A year later in 1864, Henson had the misfortune of being brought to the attention of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest too many times for his own good. Forrest arrested and imprisoned him for over six months until Henson finally managed to escape and return to Union lines prior to the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to Grant at Appomattox. It was then that his \\"handler\\" General Dodge was quoted as having said to Henson \\"Well, Phil, the damn rope has not been made yet to hang you\\". Dodge referred to Henson as his \\"most colorful spy\\". Afterwards, when Forrest was asked about his not having \\"hung him until dead\\", he uttered that Henson was \\"The most dangerous spy operating within the Confederacy\\". However, it wouldn't be until much later that Henson in an interview with one of Joseph Pulitzer's Fighting Editors George Sibley Johns in September 1887 would himself say about his efforts on behalf and to the benefit of his beloved country; \\"I don't know how, but I believe that God was with me and preserved me for what I had to do. I never felt a fear of death. When I was ordered to be shot once, I told my wife that I did not believe that I would be shot, but if I should be I was ready to die for the cause, as my work would be finished\\". For his contributions to the war effort Henson would receive brevets for the rank of Major. Career as Special Secret Service Agent and death For Henson, especially taking into consideration his skills and talents as a master of disguise and dialects, impersonator, horseman, marksman, sharpshooter and cryptographer, his career as a Special Secret Service Agent was a natural progression for him. In the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, General Grant asked him to conduct a \\"confidential and discrete\\" investigation to discover any and all details of Lincoln's death. It was a task that continued during Grant's Presidency and resulted in brevets for the rank of Lieutenant Colonel being bestowed upon him. Ultimately, it took over twenty years to complete. According to Henson's sons, he told them Grant had died without giving permission to release the findings, but that \\"Damn thing of it was to track the trail of blood, bodies and bucks 'til it got me there\\". Denied a pension by the government after the war, he took to giving lectures about his spying activities to make a living, showing off his beard, which he let grow to over 6 feet long, to promote his appearances. Henson died in Paris, Texas at the home of his eldest son, Phillip Edgar, a well-known cotton dealer, at 10:15 P.M. on Tuesday evening the 10th day of January, 1911. The younger son Captain William O'Dell resided in San Antonio, Texas at the time. Philip Henson and his wife, Celestine, who had died approximately ten years before him, are interred side by side in the Henry Cemetery in Corinth, Mississippi. According to his sons his last words were \\"Reckon you never ever know until you get there\\". References and external links *Correspondence.

Business triage involves categorizing desired outcomes and goals and the processes that support them based on their relative importance to achieving a stated measurable goal or outcome. Using the same triage categories employed by military medical and disaster medical services, business processes are categorized as essential/critical (red) important/urgent (yellow), or optional/supportive (green). In a business triage model, resources are allocated based on the outcome/goal and process category/rank, with resources first dedicated to red, then yellow, and finally green categories. In the event that resources become limited, resources are first withheld from green, then yellow categories. Resources are only withheld from red categories if failure to achieve outcomes/goals is acceptable. History First described in the late 1990s, business triage grew out of the need for a reproducible method for the allocation of limited resources (especially money) by start-up and expanding businesses. The concepts utilized in business triage were drawn from the real-world experience of managing limited resources in the high-stakes environments of battlefields and disaster scenes (medical triage). Process analysis methods similar to those used by information technology professionals and later business continuity professionals were added to better identify the processes that support the desired outcomes and goals. Application and technique The application of business triage to businesses requires a detailed examination of the desired outcomes and goals for the business in question. Internal outcomes and goals such as building maintenance and employee safety must be included in the inventory along with the more obvious external outcomes and goals such as product sales and delivery of services to the end customer. The more detailed this examination, the more accurate and helpful the subsequent use of resources will be. Once the internal and external outcomes and goals examination is complete, these must be categorized based on their relationship to the core mission and values of the company. Outcomes and goals are categorized into three prioritised categories. Within each category, the desired outcomes and goals are ranked based on the \\"threat\\" presented to the company if the outcome or goal is not achieved and the level of \\"outrage\\" that will occur should the threat be realized. This \\"threat\\" and \\"outrage\\" relationship is calculated as a PIVOT score where: Threat = Probability × (Impact + Vulnerability) PIVOT Score = (Threat)Outrage The greater the PIVOT Score, the higher the relative priority within the triage category. After outcomes and goals are triaged, the processes that support each outcome or goal are triaged according to the same relationships described above. Processes are first categorized with the same categories as above. Again, within each category the processes for each outcome are ranked based on their respective PIVOT Score with the higher relative priority within a triage category given to the processes with the greater PIVOT Score. Available resources, including money, materials, and personnel are allocated based on the relative triage and ranking of the desired outcome/goal to the processes that contribute to achieving that outcome/goal, with the highest ranking process receiving resources before lower ranking processes within each outcome/goal grouping.

When the company was nationalised in 1948 it became part of the state-owned General Urquiza Railway. History Posadas station, terminus. The company was founded in 1887 to take over and complete two lines from Monte Caseros in Corrientes Province. The first was to go to Corrientes (371 km), the provincial capital, and the second to Posadas (442 km), the capital of Misiones Province. In 1888 the company acquired a batch of 32 steam locomotives to Scottish manufacturer Neilson and Company. Construction of the line to Corrientes, completed as far as Curuzú Cuatiá in 1890, was extended to Mercedes in 1898 and finally reached Corrientes later in the same year. The Posadas line reached Paso de los Libres in 1894 and was extended to Santo Tomé in 1901. Once the section from Santo Tomé to Posadas was opened some years later in 1911 an international rail connection with Paraguay was established. In 1907 the ANER took over British-owned East Argentine Railway, which operated a line from Monte Caseros south to Concordia in Entre Ríos Province. Two years later a branch line from San Diego to the port of Goya on the River Paraná was completed and in 1915 the line from Concordia was extended south to the river port of Concepción del Uruguay. Later that same year the ANER established a joint administration with the neighboring British-owned Entre Ríos Railway. By the time then President of Argentina Juan Perón nationalised the complete Argentine railway network in 1948 the ANER was operating a 1,212 km network which became part of the state-owned General Urquiza Railway.

The proposal, made to encourage political discourse, was put forward in late 2007 following popular concern that southern Africa was at risk of losing political, social and economic headway. Much of the discussion to date has surrounded the need for the nucleation of an economic and social example for southern Africa, as well as innovative approaches to reducing crime and poverty in the region. The concept of a special administrative region in southern African is based in the theory of Paul Romer, professor of economics at New York University. Romer proposes founding many new charter cities on the coasts of developing countries. These cities would be run according to business-friendly rules and could create jobs for many millions of people. Romer argues that rich nations should guarantee the enforcement of rules in charter cities, while developing countries would provide the land. The Progressive initiative, a South African political organisation, is pursuing this concept.

The episcopal see is located in Angers Cathedral in the city of Angers. The diocese extends over the entire department of Maine-et-Loire. It was a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of Tours under the old regime as well as under the Concordat. Currently, the diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo. History The first Bishop known in history is Defensor, who, when present in 372, at the election of the Bishop of Tours, made a determined stand against the nomination of Saint Martin. The legend concerning the earlier episcopate of a certain Auxilius, is connected with the cycle of legends that centre about Saint Firmin of Amiens and is contradicted by Angevin tradition from before the thirteenth century. Among the illustrious names of the Diocese of Angers during the first centuries of its existence are those of Saint Maurilius, disciple of Saint Martin, and at an earlier period hermit of Chalonnes, who made a vigorous stand against idolatry, and died in 427; Thalassius, consecrated bishop in 453, who has left a compendium of canon law, consisting of the decisions of the councils of the province of Tours; Saint Albinus (sixth century); Saint Licinius, former Count of Anjou, and bishop during the early part of the seventh century. As for the tradition that Saint Renatus, who had been raised from the dead by Saint Maurilius, was Bishop of Angers for some time shortly before 450, it bases its claims to credibility on a late life of Saint Maurilius written in 905 by the deacon Archinald, and circulated under the name of Gregory of Tours, and it seems to have no real foundation. Among the Bishops of Angers in modern times were Cardinal de la Balue (1467) confined by Louis XI in an iron cage (1469–1480) for his negotiations with Charles the Bold; the Jansenist, Henri Arnauld (1649–1693); Monsignor Freppel (1870–1891), who had a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, and warmly defended religious interests; Monsignor Mathieu (1893–1896), cardinal of the Curia and member of the French Academy. Angers Cathedral, a majestic structure without side aisles, dedicated to Saint Maurice, dates from the twelfth century and exhibits the characteristic type of Angevin or Plantagenet architecture. During the Middle Ages Angers was a flourishing monastic city with six great monasteries: the Abbey of St. Aubin founded by King Childebert I; the Abbey of St. Serge by Clovis II; those of St. Julien, St. Nicholas and Ronceray, founded by Count Foulques Nerra, and All Saints' Abbey, an admirable structure of the twelfth century. In 1219 Pope Callixtus II went in person to Angers to assist at the second consecration of the church attached to Ronceray Abbey. The Diocese of Angers includes Fontevrault, an abbey founded at the close of the eleventh century by Robert d'Arbrissel but which did not survive the Revolution. The ruins of St. Maur perpetuate the memory of the great Benedictine abbey of that name. In 1244, a university was founded at Angers for the teaching of canon and civil law. In 1432 faculties of theology, medicine and art were added. This university was divided into six \\"nations,\\" and survived up to the time of the Revolution. In consequence of the law of 1875 giving liberty in the matter of higher education, Angers again became the seat of a Catholic university. The Congregation of the Good Shepherd (Bon Pasteur), which has houses in all parts of the world, has its mother-house at Angers by virtue of a papal brief of 1835. Berengarius, the heresiarch condemned for his doctrines on the Holy Eucharist, was Archdeacon of Angers about 1039, and for some time found a protector in the person of Eusebius Bruno, Bishop of Angers. Bernier, who played a great role in the wars of La Vendée and in the negotiations that led to the Concordat, was curé of St. Laud in Angers.

Oldco was founded in 1998 by media entrepreneur Rodney Parnther and director Roderick Giles. Productions Oldco was best known for financing and producing well-crafted high quality 35mm short films under the Urban S.L.A.M. (Short Live Action Movies) brand. Urban S.L.A.M. is a platform that introduces audiences to the work of a new generation of urban filmmakers. These films were generally well-crafted pieces that feature both established and emerging African American performers. The films have been official selections at prominent film festivals throughout the U.S. and have aired on cable networks owned by HBO, Showtime and BET. One of the shorts, The Tested, won the top prize at the 2006 Los Angeles International Short Film Festival, qualifying it for an Academy Award nomination. Oldco distributed the Urban S.L.A.M. series in the home entertainment market as well as other titles under a multi-year agreement with Alternative Distribution Alliance(ADA), a unit of Warner Music Group. The series was presented as a collection of 5-8 high quality short films with compelling segments in between films. Oldco also offered colleges and universities across the U.S. live programs built around selected documentaries for Black History Month, notably From Martin to Tupac: Political Assassinations. This program completed a successful tour in February 2009, which included screenings at USC, Fordham University, Carnegie Mellon (UMC), Wellesley and Ferris State. In April 2007, Oldco released The Adventures of Teddy P. Brains: Journey into the Rain Forest, the critically acclaimed first episode of a 3D animated series aimed at children 5–8 years old. The series follows the exploits of 6-year old Teddy, an African-American boy with a love for learning, his cousin Tempest Wits and dog D’Artagnan as they travel around the earth and back in time on exciting missions. In March 2008, Oldco released the award-winning documentary Who Killed Martin Luther King?, directed by Emmy award-winning John Edginton, on DVD for the first time. In the summer of 2008 Shoebox Pictures went into production on the feature-length version of The Tested with Russell Costanzo once more at the helm and Melissa B. Miller producing. The feature-length version expands on the controversial themes of redemption, justice, and the cycle of violence and stars Aunjanue Ellis, Armando Riesco, Michael Morris Jr. and Frank Vincent. In August 2012, a new company was incorporated in Delaware by the founders and assumed the name Clarendon Entertainment (\\"Newco\\"). After a significant capital raise, Newco is now focused on helping filmmakers and other content creators raise money for their projects, primarily through crowdfunding and Sec. 181 financing. Newco is currently based in Fort Lee, NJ. Oldco was dissolved and is no longer active. Partial filmography =Features= * The Adventures of Teddy P.

Born in the Auvergne to the lesser nobility, he studied under Genesius of Clermont. He was ordained a priest and, with the approval of Childeric II, became bishop of Clermont in 666. Praejectus founded monasteries, hospitals, and churches. He was killed as a result of political struggles of the day. Hector, lord of Marseilles, had been accused of various crimes, and at the order of Childeric, had been arrested and executed. Agritius, the man who killed Praejectus, believed that the bishop had been responsible for Hector’s death. At Volvic, the assassin thus stabbed to death Praejectus and Amarinus, abbot of a monastery in the area. The death of Praejectus was linked to that of Saint Leger (Leodegarius). St. Leger was an opponent of Ebroin, mayor of the palace of Neustria on two occasions; firstly from 658 to his deposition in 673 and secondly from 675 to his death in 680 or 681. In a violent and despotic career, he strove to impose the authority of Neustria, which was under his control, over Burgundy and Austrasia. Ebroin’s supporters, which included Praejectus, St. Reol of Rheims, St. Agilbert of Paris, and St. Ouen of Rouen, held a council of bishops that sat in judgment on Leger, at Marly, near Paris. Praejectus’ murderer may have been a supporter of Leger, who was later murdered on October 2, 679.Henry Hart Milman, History of Latin Christianity (T.Y. Crowell, 1881), 398.Barbara H. Rosenwein, Emotional Communities in the Early Middle Ages (New York: Cornell University Press, 2006), 170. Veneration An account of Praejectus’ life was written shortly after his death and he was immediately venerated as a martyr. The account was written perhaps by 690, as it was written during the lifetime of Bishop Avitus of Clermont. The author may have been a nun from the monastery of Chamalières. Chamalières was a monastery founded through Praejectus’ efforts, and it was presided over by an abbess who was probably a member of Praejectus’ family. The author may also have been a monk from Volvic or Saint-Amarin. During the time of Charlemagne, Abbot Manasses of Flavigny Abbey transferred from Volvic to Flavigny the relics of Praejectus. His cultus spread to English monastic calendars. The church at Volvic, where Praejectus was killed, is dedicated to “St Priest” (Projectus).Bienvenue sur le site de la commune de Volvic In 1278, some of his relics (a finger) were translated to the town of Saint-Prix (Val-d'Oise). The valley of Saint-Amarin was named after Amarinus. Image:Saint-Prix - Plaque saint Pry.jpgCommemorative plaque at Saint-Prix, Val d'Oise.

He also played at minor counties level for Cumberland County Cricket Club and also represented Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Kent Second XIs. With a successful record at Cumbria Schools Cricket Association from Under 13 level to Under 19 level, White was selected for the North of England Schools at both Under 14 and Under 19 levels, with mixed success. After becoming the youngest player to score a century in the Cumbria Cricket League at 15 for Cockermouth, White joined Netherfield in the Northern League aged 17, and became the youngest centurion in that league, scoring 115 not out against Blackpool at Parkside Road. Netherfield won their first league title in that season. White represented Leicestershire Second XI in two fixtures in 1997, against Northamptonshire Second XI at Grace Road in August and against Lancashire Second XI at Aigburth in September. White was then signed by Ashwood CC in the Eastern Suburbs Cricket Association of Melbourne to become their overseas player for the 1997-98 season. He performed well in Australia and returned to the UK for pre-season matches with Leicestershire. After being impressed with White the previous year, Northamptonshire offered him a one- year contract in April 1998. White made his Second XI Championship debut in the win at Worcestershire, scoring 49, and he made his 50-over debut in July, and scored his highest score (57) in the victory over the Minor Counties Under-25's at North Runcton. Two centuries followed for the Northamptonshire Colts, and White finished the season having played in seven Second XI Championship games, as Northamptonshire completed the 'double', winning the Championship and 50-over competition. Tipped to make his first-class debut, White was named 12th man for the match against Yorkshire at Wantage Road in May, but did not get another opportunity; despite averaging 26.16 in Championship matches and 33.50 in the one-day Trophy, White was released from the full-time staff at the end of the season.Gareth White, Northamptonshire Second XI summary, 1998 season, CricketArchive.

It featured the Red Raiders of Texas Tech University, who finished third in the Big 12 Conference's South Division, and the Cavaliers of the University of Virginia, who finished second in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division. Texas Tech won the game on a last-second field goal, securing a 31–28 victory. It was one of 32 games in the 2007–08 bowl season. The Gator Bowl is an annual college football bowl game that is played at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. It is one of the oldest college bowls, held continuously since 1946. This edition's full name was the Konica Minolta Gator Bowl after its sponsor, Konica Minolta.Gator Bowl lands new deal for title sponsor Overview The Gator Bowl has tie-ins from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big 12 Conference, and Big East Conferences, as well as independent Notre Dame. They have the right to the third pick of a team from the ACC, and have the option to offer the other spot to the second pick from the Big East, the fourth pick from the Big 12, or Notre Dame. The 2008 game featured the ACC's Virginia Cavaliers, who finished the 2007 season with an overall record of 9–3 (6–2 in the ACC) playing the Big 12's Texas Tech Red Raiders, who finished the 2007 season with an overall record of 8–4 (4–4 in the Big 12). The game was the eighth straight post season appearance for the Red Raiders. Virginia returned to a bowl game after failing to qualify for one following the 2006 season. Recap After Texas Tech jumped out to an early 7-0 lead, scoring on their second drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Graham Harrell to Detron Lewis, Virginia reeled off 21 straight points, including two safeties where Harrell was called for intentional grounding in the endzone. Virginia tailback Mikell Simpson scored on a 96-yard run, an NCAA bowl record for a running back. Virginia carried a 21-7 lead into the locker room at halftime and seemed to be in control after Simpson hauled in an 11-yard pass from quarterback Peter Lalich with 11:26 left in the game to make the score 28-14. With 7:54 left in the game, Texas Tech turned the ball over on downs just outside Virginia's goal line. The Cavaliers were unable to pick up a first down and, following a punt, the Red Raiders took over at midfield trailing by 14 with 5:32 left. Harrell engineered an efficient drive completing five of his eight passes on the drive, including a 20-yard fade to Michael Crabtree for a touchdown to make it 28-21 with 3:31 left on the clock. On Virginia's ensuing drive, Lalich was sacked and fumbled the football, setting up a one-play drive for Texas Tech — a four-yard touchdown run for Aaron Crawford. Virginia was again unable to pick up a first down and Texas Tech drove to the UVA 24 yard line and Alex Trlica kicked the winning 41-yard field goal with two seconds left. The final score was Texas Tech 31, Virginia 28.

His main characteristics were his speed, his technique and his shooting. He competed in 430 games in total on the Greek Championship for Panionios and AEK Athens, scoring 181 goals. He was the top scorer of the league in 1970–71 and 1975–1976. In 1971, he was awarded the bronze boot after becoming the third best scorer in Europe. Club career =Early years= Son of Athanasios and Nikoleta, Giorgos was the fifth of their six children. Dedes was nephew of AEK Athens' legendary goalkeeper, Christos Ribas, and his elder brother, Kostas played for Pannafpliakos. As a boy he supported AEK Athens and he was a great fan of Kostas Nestoridis. In 1957 his family moved to Athens and Giorgos played alongside his brother for Phivos Neou Kosmou. In 1960–61, Phivos Neou Kosmou won the B1 league of Athens Football Clubs Association and Dedes was one of the basic scorers. =Panionios= At the age of 17 he was discovered by Panagiotis Pallas of Panionios and he was recommended to the technical director of the team, Thanasis Papathanasiou. Dedes was transferred to Panionios; the transfer fee was 1000 drachmas and some other players as an exchange. Two months later, the coach of the team, Ioannis Skordillis and Nikos Zakardis gave him the chance to play for the first time against Fostiras. On 28 March 1965 Dedes scored the fastest hat-trick in Alpha Ethniki in a period of 120 seconds after the 88th minute. In the 1969–70 season, Dedes scored five goals in a game in an 8–0 victory against Olympiakos Nicosia, which is the club's largest victory. That was a rare record which only a few Greek footballers have achieved. Dedes has also scored four goals in a match on two occasions. He played for Panionios for 14 years, winning a Balkans Cup in 1971. He was the top scorer of the Greek Championship with 28 goals, becoming the 3rd scorer in Europe behind the Croatian, Josip Skoblar of Olympique de Marseille with 39 and Keita of Saint-Étienne with 33. =AEK Athens= In 1974 Dedes transferred to the Greek giants AEK Athens of Loukas Mparlos. Although he was a free agent, AEK Athens paid 500,000 drachmas to have him. In three years of playing for AEK Athens he achieved 50 caps scoring 35 goals. Furthermore, in season 1975-76 he once more became the top scorer of the Greek Championship, scoring 16 goals. =Return to Panionios and retirement= Dedes returned to Panionios for the 1977–78 season to finish his career. He was honoured with the Golden Cross, the club's greatest award. Dedes describes the award as \\"priceless\\" and it is the centerpiece of his medal collection. International career In 1962 Dedes was called to the Greece U-18, for which he played in two matches against Turkey, a 1–0 defeat in Athens and 1–0 win in Smyrni where he was the scorer in the 18th minute. With the U-19 team he competed in two games for the qualifying matches of UEFA European Under-19 Championship against Turkey. With a 2–1 victory in Athens and a 1–1 draw in Ankara, Greece managed to qualify for 1963 UEFA European Under-18 Championship in London. Dedes played in both 3 matches of the tournament in which he scored two goals in a 7–2 victory against Germany. Greece didn't qualify for the quarter finals as they finished third in the group. In 1969 Dedes played the only game for Greece U-21 against Israel. He managed 20 appearances and scored seven goals for the Greek national football team from 1966 to 1973. He played his first match on 16 October 1966 in a 2–1 win against Finland for the UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying. He scored his first two goals for Greece on 21 November 1968 in a 4–1 home victory against Egypt. Dedes was a regular in the 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification squad where he scored twice. His first goal for the tournament was in a historical 2–1 victory against Portugal on 11 December 1968 in Karaiskakis Stadium and the second was in a 2–2 draw against Romania on 16 April 1969 with Dedes taking the lead for Greece. He made his last appearance for Greece on 31 January 1973 in a match against Bulgaria as a second-half substitute in a match which ended 2–2.

(1942) is the thirteenth of seventeen animated Technicolor short films based upon the DC Comics character of Superman. Produced by Famous Studios, the cartoon was originally released to theaters by Paramount Pictures on December 25, 1942. Plot One night in Metropolis, the elderly night watchman from the Metropolis Munitions Works is found dead in a swamp. When news of the incident reaches the city the next morning, Lois Lane and Clark Kent both decide to grab the story for themselves. Clark talks to Lois, not realizing she has already left and that he is talking to a bus driver named Louis. The bus driver gets angry at what he thinks was a mistake about his name. As Lois goes undercover at the plant after meeting with the plant supervisor in the Personnel Building, she meets the new night guard, a kindly, white-haired, old man leaving the Personnel MGR. office. Lois overhears Mr. Jones's plan to blow up the factory. Posing as a factory worker, Lois overhears the foreman telling two of the workers that Mr. Jones, one of the supervisors, wants them in his office upstairs at 12. During break time, the workers head up to Mr. Jones' office. Up in the office, Lois overhears Mr. Jones' plan to blow up the factory as the switch to the factory's night lights has been rigged to a case of dynamite. It is also revealed that the workers killed the night watchman to cover their tracks. Just then, Mr. Jones sees Lois outside the office window and opens the blinds, causing Lois to realize that she has been seen. Mr. Jones sends the workers to catch her. Lois manages to get away from the workers across a window ledge and beams, but is caught by the foreman. She is gagged and loaded inside a test torpedo with another case of dynamite. (As a company rule, test torpoedoes aren't loaded with explosives.) The night guard enters the room and rushes to help Lois after witnessing what's happening. However, the foreman stops the night guard by dropping several tons of scrap metal on him, seemingly killing him. The torpedo is sent to the testing range and set to be fired at a dummy ship. Back inside the factory, the night guard is struggling to free himself from the rubble. As soon as he finally frees himself, the night guard is revealed to be Clark himself, having posed undercover as well to see what's going on. Having changed himself into Superman, Clark flies off to the test field. As the test torpedo is fired, Superman rushes out to the testing range and saves Lois before the torpedo explodes. He frees Lois, who tells him that Mr. Jones is about to blow up the plant. Realizing that they've been discovered, Mr. Jones orders the foreman to throw the night guard's switch now. However, Superman stops the foreman and the workers from throwing it fully before beating them down. Just when Mr. Jones thinks his plans are ruined, he spots a truck loaded with dynamite. He steers the truck toward the factory in a collision course, then jumps out before impact. Lois warns Superman about the truck, and he sends it over a cliff, saving the factory. The story ends with Mr. Jones, the foreman and the workers being arrested for their crimes, and Lois revealing that she knew Clark was the night guard all along. It may have been meant as a subtle irony that Lois was able to see through this disguise easily but could not figure out that Clark was Superman as well.

The brand originally sold gloves, perfumes, and bridal bouquets. The original shop, called \\"A la Corbeille de Fleurs\\", was at 19, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Over the centuries, the House of Houbigant became perfumer to the royal courts of Europe including Napoleon, Napoleon III, Alexander III of Russia, and Queen Victoria. History Robert Bienaimé, Houbigant perfumer from 1912 to 1935 and creator of Quelques Fleurs In 1882 the House launched Fougère Royale, the first fougère (or 'fern-like') perfume ever created,{fact}} establishing a new fragrance family which still remains today the most popular family in men's fragrances. During this period, under the direction of the Paris office, offices were established in the United States, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania. The New York office had its own manufacturing facility to distribute Houbigant goods nationwide. Houbigant was also the first perfume house to discover how to isolate particular molecules from natural raw materials and more specifically the coumarin, which is isolated from the tonka bean. In 1912 they introduced Quelques Fleurs, the first true multi-floral bouquet ever created. Up to that time, floral fragrances had been mostly single flowers or were blended with herbs and other essences. The Genealogy of Perfumes cites Quelques Fleurs as an innovation that established a totally new fragrance classification and influenced other compositions for years afterwards including many of today’s important fragrances.

He is the editor/coauthor of The Diaconate Now (Corpus-World, 1968), and coauthor of Living Issues In Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1995), Living Issues in Ethics (Wadsworth 1982 and iUniverse 2000), and Soul Mates: More than Partners (online, 2004). Nolan is also the editor of a non-commercial, educational website: philosophy-religion.org.www.philosophy-religion.org . His books have been translated into several languages, including Indonesian and Chinese. Education and professional career Richard Nolan is a 1954 alumnus of the Boston Latin School; he then enrolled at The Tabor Academy in Marion, MA. Nolan received his bachelor's degree from Trinity College in 1960. Following his graduation from Trinity, Nolan continued his studies in divinity at Hartford Seminary, receiving his Masters in Divinity in 1963. During his time at Hartford Seminary, he also held his first position as an instructor in Latin and English at Watkinson School in Hartford, CT. Shortly after completing his studies at Hartford, he was ordained a deacon at Christ Church in June 1963 in Waltham, MA. He was ordained a priest in June 1965 at St. John's, in Arlington, MA. Nolan received his master's in Religion from the Yale University Divinity School in 1967; during his studies, he was also an instructor in math and religion, and associate chaplain at the Cheshire Academy from 1965 to 1967. That same year, Nolan accepted a position as an instructor of philosophy and education at the Hartford Seminary Foundation, and in 1968 was promoted to the position of Assistant Academic Dean. Nolan continued to expand his responsibilities; in 1969 he accepted a position as an instructor at the Mattatuck Community College in Waterbury, CT. Meanwhile, Nolan was completing his Ph.D. studies at New York University, where he was granted a Doctor of Philosophy in Religion in 1973. Nolan remained an instructor at Mattatuck for many years, becoming an associate professor in 1974, and a full professor of philosophy and social sciences in 1978. He held his post at Mattatuck until 1992. In the intervening years, Dr. Nolan also held adjunct and/or visiting professor positions at Trinity College, Long Island University, the University of Miami, St. Joseph College, Pace University, and many others. Nolan continued teaching at the University of Connecticut, Hartford Graduate Center, and Central Connecticut State University until he retired in 1994. Despite retirement, he continued to teach part-time at Broward Community College, Barry University, Florida Atlantic University, and Palm Beach Community College as recently as 2002. In 1992, Nolan was named a retired honorary canon for life at Christ Church Cathedral in Hartford, CT. He also holds posts as pastor emeritus for St. Paul's Parish, in Bantam, CT (since 1988), member of the society of regents at Cathedral Church St. John the Divine (since 2002), retired priest-in-residence at St. Andrew's Church in Lake Worth, FL (since 2002), and professor emeritus at Mattatuck Community College, in Waterbury, CT. Nolan has been the author and editor on numerous books, including The Diaconate Now (Corpus-World, 1968), Living Issues in Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1995), and Living Issues in Ethics (Wadsworth 1982 and iUniverse 2000). His books have been translated into several languages, including Indonesian and Chinese. His online \\"Commentary on the Episcopal Prayer Book Catechism\\" has been translated into Polish. Since 2000, Nolan has been the editor of the website philosophy- religion.org, a reference on philosophy and religion topics and papers, used internationally and recommended by Yale University and several other colleges and universities in the United States and beyond. Personal life While attending Trinity College (Connecticut) in 1955, Nolan met his life partner, Robert C. Pingpank. Throughout their lives, they were forced to hide their relationship due to the potential of losing their jobs. During a career change for both in 1967, the couple finally moved in together into a unique two- family house designed by Pingpank, so that they could live together, yet maintain separate addresses and phones. This allowed them to maintain their relationship while avoiding challenges to their careers; they lived in this home until their retirement in 1994, when they moved to Florida. The couple has been profiled by The LGBT Religious Archives Network, and the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies in Religion and Ministry (a recently established center of the Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, California). Richard Nolan and Robert Pingpank were married legally at age 72 on June 4, 2009, in the Trinity College Chapel, Hartford, CT. Nolan and Pingpank reside in the John Knox Village (a continuing care retirement community), Pompano Beach, FL, and are active in Lambda Legal and Integrity Palm Beach.

He served as a Republican member of the Washington State House of Representatives from Washington's 18th legislative district in Position 1 from 2005 to 2007. The district is located in rural Clark and Cowlitz counties.  Election and voting record  Curtis was elected to the La Center City Council. He was elected to the State House of Representatives in November 2, 2004 succeeding Republican Tom Mielke Curtis faced no primary opposition and won the general election with 56.5 percent of the vote in a race against Democratic candidate Pam Brokaw. He took office in January 2005 and was re-elected in 2006, winning with 59.1 percent of the vote against his opponent, Democrat Jonathan Fant. Curtis, who is married with two daughters, built up a socially conservative voting record while in office. In 2006, he opposed a gay rights bill that banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In spring 2007, he voted against domestic partnerships for gay and lesbian couples.  Resignation  On October 30, 2007, the Spokesman- Review newspaper for the city of Spokane released the results of an investigation that established that Curtis had met another man, Cody Castagna, in an adult bookstore, with whom he later had sex in a local hotel room. Curtis was also alleged to have been seen previously and on that occasion clad in women's clothing, wearing them underneath his own. According to a police statement from Curtis, Castagna attempted to extort $1,000 from him after the encounter in return for not revealing his \\"gay lifestyle\\" to his family. Based on this statement, Curtis brought formal extortion charges against Castagna. Castagna has denied all accusations of the extortion, which is a Class B felony. A statement by his lawyer asserted, \\"This is an extremely low-level situation that's being blown out of proportion by somebody who is trying to save themselves.\\" The lawyer stated further that \\"this guy (Castagna) didn't do anything wrong – at that level, anyway.\\" Curtis first denied having had sex with the man, contradicting his own statements to police. Curtis resigned from the Washington State House of Representatives on October 31, 2007. Upon then issued a statement: > Today I submitted my letter of resignation to Governor Gregoire effective > immediately.

According to analysis by The Olympian, the Republican leadership in the state has now moved to attempt to control the damage of Curtis' resignation, issuing statements of their own. State House Republican Leader Richard DeBolt said he was \\"disappointed\\" and that Curtis \\"can no longer effectively represent the constituents who elected him\\".

This mountain range stretches for some 100 km north-west to south-east, parallel to the Halil Rud, to the north-east of Jiroft and to the south-west of Bam, rising to a maximal elevation of 3,750 m. The mountains of this range are continued by other mountains such as Mount Shahsavaran and Mount Hudian to the south-east. They separate the plain of Hamun-e Jaz Murian from that of Namakzar-e Shahdad and Lut desert. Etymology The root of the name of this mountain is identical to that of the Alburz in northern Iran and the Elbrus in the Caucasus, and therefore, it is likewise derived from an unattested Old Persian term *Harā Brzatī, cognate with Avestan Harā Bərəzaitī (see Harā Bərəzaitī), meaning \\"high watchpost\\". The more proper spelling of the name of this mountain is Albarez. Albarez is of the same construct as the names Alburz and Elbrus. The ancient Iranian peoples seem to have given this name to the tallest mountains in any area that they happened to live (exactly as the Turkic people did when they called all the tallest mountains in their sight, \\"Qaradağ\\"/Karadag, with the term qara/kara standing for great/big, as well as color black). In fact, into the early 20th century, the northern portions of the Hindu Kush mountains near Balkh/Mazar-i Sharif was also known as Mt.

This influential book in the field of science studies presents an anthropological study of Roger Guillemin's scientific laboratory at the Salk Institute. It advances a number of observations regarding how scientific work is conducted, including descriptions of the complex relationship between the routine lab practices performed by scientists, the publication of papers, scientific prestige, research finances and other elements of laboratory life. The book is considered to be one of the most influential works in the laboratory studies tradition within Science and Technology Studies. It is inspired but not entirely dependent on the ethnomethodological approach. In turn, it served as the inspiration for Actor–network theory (or ANT); many of ANT's core concepts (like transcription, inscription, translation, and the deployment of networks) are present in Laboratory Life. Introduction and Methodology Latour and Woolgar state that their work \\"concerns the way in which the daily activities of working scientists lead to the construction of scientific facts\\" (40). Laboratory Life therefore stands in opposition to the study of scandalous moments in which the so-called \\"normal\\" operation of science was disrupted by external forces. In contrast, Latour and Woolgar give an account of a how scientific facts are produced in a laboratory in situ, or as it happens. An Anthropologist Visits the Laboratory The initial methodology of Laboratory Life involves an \\"anthropological strangeness\\" (40) in which the laboratory is a tribe foreign to the researcher. The study of the lab begins with a semi- fictionalized account of an ignorant observer who knows nothing of laboratories or scientists. In this account, Latour and Woolgar \\"bracket\\" (44) their previous knowledge of scientific practice and ironically ask seemingly- nonsensical questions about observed practices in the laboratory, such as \\"Are the heated debates in front of the blackboard part of some gambling contest?\\" In the asking and answering of these questions, the observer's understanding of laboratory practices is gradually refined, leading to a strong focus on the significance of paper documents. The observer soon recognizes that all the scientists and technicians in the lab write in some fashion, and that few activities in the lab are not connected to some sort of transcription or inscription. The foreign observer describes the laboratory as \\"strange tribe\\" of \\"compulsive and manic writers ... who spend the greatest part of their day coding, marking, altering, correcting, reading, and writing\\" (48-9). Large and expensive laboratory equipment (such as bioassays or mass spectrometers) are interpreted as \\"inscription device[s]\\" that have the sole purpose of \\"transform[ing] a material substance into a figure or diagram\\" (51). In this way, the observer works to organize and systematize the laboratory such that it \\"began to take on the appearance of a system of literary inscription\\" (52). Having concluded that the \\"production of papers\\" for publication in a scientific journal is the primary focus of a laboratory, the observer next aims to \\"consider papers as objects in much the same way as manufactured goods\\" (71). This involves asking how papers are produced, what their constituent elements (or raw materials) are, and why these papers are so important. First, the authors recognize that in papers, \\"some statements appeared more fact-like than others\\" (76). From this observation, a five- element continuum of facticity is constructed, which spans from type 5 statements which are taken for granted to type 1 statements which are unqualified speculations, with various intermediate levels in between. The conclusion reached is that statements in a laboratory routinely travel up and down this continuum, and the main purpose of a laboratory is to take statements of one level of facticity and transform them to another level. However, Latour and Woolgar recognize that this semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer aiming to systematize the alien laboratory has several problems. While the observer's rich descriptions of activity in the lab are taken as accurate, the observer has not established that the interpretation of this data in terms of literary inscription is exhaustive or the only way in which laboratory life can be analyzed. In the authors' words, the observer's account is not \\"immune from all possibility of future qualification\\" (88). The Construction of a Fact: The Case of TRF(H) The next chapter aims at giving a precise account of the way in which this process operates with respect to a single scientific fact: the peptide TRF(H). This historical account, which Latour and Woolgar admit is, like all histories, a \\"necessarily literary fiction\\" (107), has the ostensible purpose of qualifying the initial account given by the observer. To this end, the chapter focuses on the specific way in which TRF(H) was constructed as a fact, describing how one scientist, Guillemin, \\"redefine[d] the TRF subspecialty solely in terms of determining the structure of the substance\\" (119). As sequencing TRF(H) required far more sophisticated equipment and techniques than merely determining its physiological effects, Guillemin raised the cost of entry to this field and cut his potential competitors by three-fourths. The authors next claim that the fact regarding TRF(H)'s structure progressed by decreases in the number of \\"'logically' possible alternatives\\" (146). However, Latour and Woolgar critique the explanation that \\"logic\\" or \\"deduction\\" is a satisfactory and complete explanation for the specific way in which a scientific fact is constructed. Instead, as their historical account of TRF(H) shows, the \\"list of possible alternatives by which we can evaluate the logic of a deduction is sociologically (rather than logically) determined\\" (136). Specifically, the material, technical, and human resources of a laboratory affected what kinds of challenges and counter-facts could be constructed and formulated, leading Latour and Woolgar to later conclude that \\"the set of statements considered too costly to modify constitute what is referred to as reality\\" (243). In the previous section, Latour and Woolgar used a semi- fictional observer to describe the laboratory as a literary system in which mere statements are turned into facts and vice versa. The most sound and established facts were those statements which could be divorced from their contingent circumstances. The authors next aim to interrogate how this process operates on a very small and specific scale by looking at how this process operated with respect to the molecule TRF(H), whose molecular structure went through various stages of facticity both in and out of the laboratory Latour studied. In this section, Latour and Woolgar aim to \\"specify the precise time and place in the process of fact construction when a statement became transformed into a fact and hence freed from the circumstances of its production\\" (105). Instead of trying to construct a \\"precise chronology\\" of what \\"really happened,\\" in the field, they aim to demonstrate how \\"a hard fact can be sociologically deconstructed\\" (107) by showing how it emerged in what they call a network. A network is \\"a set of positions within which an object such as TRF has meaning\\" (107), and they recognize that TRF only has meaning within certain networks. For example, outside of the network of post-1960s endocrinology, TRF is \\"an unremarkable white powder\\" (108), which leads to the claim that a \\"well-established fact loses its meaning when divorced from its context\\" (110). Latour and Woolgar stress that \\"to say that TRF is constructed is not to deny its solidity as a fact. Rather, it is to emphasize how, where, and why it was created\\" (127). The Microprocessing of Facts This chapter turns back from grander historical accounts to the micro details of laboratory life. Through analysis of the conversations and discussions between scientists at the lab, it shows that the grander notion of science as a debate of contrasting ideas influences actual scientists only through social mechanisms. Instead of attempting to do their studies more carefully to be sure they get the right answer, scientists appear to only use as much care as they think will be necessary to defeat the counterarguments of their detractors and get the acclamation they desire for their work. It also notes that the stories scientists tell about the history of their field often omit social and institutional factors in favor of \\"moment of discovery\\" narratives. For example, one scientist tells this story: :Slovik proposed an assay but his assay did not work everywhere; people could not repeat it; some could, some could not. Then one day Slovik got the idea that it could be related to the selenium content in the water: they checked to see where the assay worked; and indeed, Slovik's idea was right, it worked wherever the selenium content of water was high. (169) This story is contrasted with another story based on interviews with the participants: The University of California required that graduate students get credits in a field totally unrelated to their own. Sara, one of Slovik's students, fulfilled this requirement by taking selenium studies, since it had a vague relation to her major. Graduate students had a tradition of informal seminars where they discussed these unrelated classes. At one meeting, Sara presented a paper on the effects of Selenium on cancer and noted that someone on campus proposed that the geographical distribution of selenium content in water might correlate with the geographical distribution of cancer rates. Slovik was at the meeting and thought that this might explain the geographical difference in his assay working. He phoned a colleague to tell him the idea and ask him to test the selenium in the water. One story says merely that Slovik \\"got the idea\\"—the other notes that institutions (the University, grad student meetings) and other people (Sara, the colleague) provided key pieces of the inspiration. The chapter closes by arguing that scientists do not simply use their inscription devices to discover already-existing entities. Instead, they project new entities out of the analysis of their inscriptions. Statements to the effect that \\"it's amazing they were able to discover it\\" only make sense when one ignores the arduous process to construct the discovery out of the inscriptions available. Similarly, justifications that the discovery is valid because it works well outside the laboratory are fallacious. Any claims as to whether a new substance like TRF works are only valid in a laboratory context (or its extension) -- the only way one can know that the substance is actually TRF (and thus that TRF is working) is through laboratory analysis. However, the authors stress that they are not relativists—they simply believe that the social causes of statements should be investigated. Cycles of Credit Scientists frequently explain their choice of field by referring to curves of interest and development, as in \\"peptide chemistry [is] tapering off ... but now ... this is the future, molecular biology, and I knew that this lab would move faster to this new area\\" (191). Desire for credit appears to only be a secondary phenomenon; instead a kind of \\"credibility capital\\" seems to be the driving motive. In a case study, they show one scientist sequentially choosing a school, a field, a professor to study under, a specialty to get expertise in, and a research institution to work at, by maximizing and reinvesting this credibility (i.e. ability to do science), despite not having received much in the way of credit (e.g. awards, recognition). Four examples: (a) X threatens to fire Ray if his assay fails, (b) a number of scientists flood into a field with theories after a successful experiment then leave when new evidence disproves their theories, (c) Y supports the results of \\"a big shot in his field\\" when others question them in order to receive invitations to meetings from the big shot where Y can meet new people, (d) K dismisses some of L's results on the grounds that \\"good people\\" won't believe them unless the level of noise is reduced (as opposed to K thinking them unreliable himself). The credibility of a scientist and their results is largely seen as identical. \\"For a working scientist, the most vital question is not 'Did I repay my debt in the form of recognition because of the good paper he wrote?' but 'Is he reliable enough to be believed? Can I trust him/his claim? Is he going to provide me with hard facts?'\\" (202) CVs are the major way this credibility is proven and career trajectories are the story of its use. Technicians and minor leaguers, by contrast, do not accumulate capital but instead are paid a \\"salary\\" by major leaguers. Editions ;English *1979. Beverly Hills: Sage Publications. . * . The preface to the second edition (1986) reads: :\\"The most substantial change to the first edition is the addition of an extended postscript in which we set out some of the reactions to the book's first publication in the light of developments in the social study of science since 1979. The postscript also explains the omission of the term \\"social\\" from this edition's new subtitle.\\" So social construction becomes just construction of scientific facts. This change indicates a shift from social constructivism to Actor-network theory, which leaves more room for the non-social or 'natural' (albeit in a non-naturalistic / non-essentialist sense). ;French *1988.

Among other works, he created collectible plates for the 1984 Summer Olympics, which became \\"The Official Gift of the 1984 Olympics\\". Escalera also created a collectible plate for the 1986 World cup hosted in Mexico. Escalera's primary medium was oils on canvas. The majority of his works are based in realism as he did not like abstract painting.  Biography  . In 1980 Escalera entered into the plate collector business. He mainly created children's plates and was featured in magazines such as \\"The Plate Collector\\" magazine. This medium led to him applying for the licensing right to be an official licensee for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He was awarded the license and commissioned to create nine paintings, depicting many of the olympic events. The paintings were converted into high quality collectible porcelain plates and sold, in limited edition quantities, to the general public. The plates were also used by the Olympic committee as the “official gift” and presented to all of the visiting dignitaries throughout the world. After the Olympics Escalera was commissioned to create a painting for the 1986 World Cup, held in Mexico City. In 1988 Escalera Moved to an area near his home town in Lerdo, Durango Mexico. Upon his return, a neighboring city, Torreon, Coahuila awarded Escalera with an official plaque from the city recognizing him as “Valor Lagunero”, an award the city offers to citizens who have had significant accomplishments throughout their lifetime. Lerdo, Durango, awarded him the designation of “Ciudadano Distinguido” or “very distinguished citizen”. Escalera’s home town of Gomez Palacio, Durango named the largest showroom at “La Casa De La Cultura (The House of Culture) after him at a dedication promoting art in all of its varying formats. In 1994 Escalera was diagnosed with cancer and died six years later January 25, 2000.  Notable owners of Escalera paintings  Escalera’s painting entitled “The Mailman” was donated to Hugh Hefner in 2003 by Escalera's sons Robert and Rudy Escalera. The painting is on display at the Playboy Mansion. This painting features a mailman reading the first edition of Playboy Magazine. He is sitting on some steps surrounded by women who are behind and posing flirtatiously. After the death of country music star Marty Robbins, Escalera presented Robbins' widow with a painting named after and depicting her late husband. The painting was presented ceremoniously onstage at the Grand Ole Opry in honor of the famous singer. Mayor Tom Bradley meets with Rodolfo Escalera to view Olympic Plates Escalera's was the only Olympic project endorsed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. At a meeting with Escalera, Bradley commented \\"We are deeply honored that Rudy Escalera, one of Los Angeles's outstanding artists, has been licensed to paint the official Licensed Commemorative plate collection for our 1984 Olympic games.\\" 250 sets of plates were created for dignitaries attending the games including Mayor Bradley, President Ronald Reagan and the Prince of Wales.  List of Paintings  Rodolfo Escalera Vizcaíno created more than 70 works of art including five masterpieces that took him approximately 20 years to complete.

The story about the introduction of his worship there is as follows: There was at Troy an ancient image of Dionysus, the work of Hephaestus, which Zeus had once given as a present to Dardamis. It was kept in a chest, and Cassandra, or, according to others, Aeneas, left this chest behind when she quit the city, because she knew that it would do injury to anyone who possessed it. When the Greeks divided the spoils of Troy among themselves, this chest fell to the share of the Thessalian Eurypylus, who on opening it suddenly fell into a state of madness. The oracle of Delphi, when consulted about his recovery, answered, \\"Where thou shalt see men performing a strange sacrifice, there shalt thou dedicate the chest, and there shalt thou settle.\\" When Eurypylus came to Aroë, it was just the season at which its inhabitants offered every year to Artemis Triclaria a human sacrifice, consisting of the fairest youth and the fairest maiden of the place. This sacrifice was offered as an atonement for a crime which had once been committed in the temple of the goddess. But an oracle had declared to them that they should be released from the necessity of making this sacrifice, if a foreign divinity should be brought to them by a foreign king. This oracle was now fulfilled. Eurypylus on seeing the victims led to the altar was cured of his madness and perceived that this was the place pointed out to him by the oracle; and the Aroeans also, on seeing the god in the chest, remembered the old prophecy, stopped the sacrifice, and instituted a festival of Dionysus Aesynmetes, for this was the name of the god in the chest. Nine men and nine women were appointed to attend to his worship. During one night of this festival a priest carried the chest outside the town, and all the children of the place, adorned, as formerly the victims used to be, with garlands of corn-ears, went down to the banks of the river Meilichius, which had before been called Ameilichius, hung up their garlands, purified themselves, and then put on other garlands of ivy, after which they returned to the sanctuary of Dionysus Aesynmetes.Pausanias, vii. 19 and 20. This tradition, though otherwise very obscure, evidently points to a time when human sacrifices were abolished at Aroë by the introduction of a new worship. At Patrae in Achaea there was likewise a temple dedicated to Dionysus Aesymnetes.Pausanias, vii. 21. § 12.

Built by Colombo Dockyard Limited for the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), it became the workhorse of the SLN against Sea tiger boats of the LTTE. Variants =Series I= The boats of the Series I are of 24m long with a mono hull with a vibration-free deck, powered by twin MTU main engines developing 1,630 kW each, driving Kamewa water jets. This enables the boat to reach speeds of 45 knots and have an endurance of 500 nm. It has a crew of 10. Around 12 were delivered to the Sri Lankan Navy. =Series II= Series II the successor to the earlier type. Main upgrades include the increase of accommodation for a crew of 12 and major improvements the superstructure. Like the Series I, around 12 were delivered to the Sri Lankan Navy. =Series III= The Series III is the recent addition to the class and has incorporated current combat requirements and experience in the battlefield archived by the Sri Lanka Navy. This new type can achieve speeds in excess of 53 knots, the fastest of its class in the region while housing to the 15 persons. Series III was designed by the Colombo Dockyard to the Israeli Shaldag Mk II design. First launch of Series III held on 27 July 1996 and it went beyond the abilities of Shaldag Mk II design by exceeding it from the speed, range and payload. The propulsion system consists of two Diesel MTU 12V 396 TE94 (1,630 kW each) engines driving two articulated surface drives, which were initially designed for competitive speedboats. Arneson Surface Drive-16 articulating propulsion systems drives provide the vessel with thrust vectoring control similar to the Super Dvora Mk III and Shaldag Mk II. Their thrust-vectoring propulsion system allows Series III to function in shallow waters at drafts of 1.2 meters facilitating special operations forces delivery on enemy shores and catastrophe relief missions. =Coastal surveillance vessel= The two Coastal surveillance vessels built for the Maldivian Coast Guard are very similar to the Series III Ultra Fast Attack Craft. It has more range but at a lower speed of 40 Knots and no armament. Armament Currently all Colombo class boats have been designed to allow for the installation of Typhoon 25-30mm stabilized cannon which can be slaved to state-of the art mast-mounted, day and night all weather long range electro-optic systems.http://www.thesundayleader.lk/archive/20040208/issues-2.htm In addition to its main armament they carry additional weapon systems such as 20 mm Oerlikon Rear Autocannons, Automatic Grenade Launchers, 7.62mm GPMGs & 12.7mm HMGs. Series III gun boats comes with Elop MSIS optronic director and Typhoon GFCS as its own weapons control system.

Electrical polarity is a term used throughout industries and fields that involve electricity. There are two types of poles: positive (+) and negative (−). This represents the electrical potential at the ends of a circuit. A battery has a positive terminal (+ pole) and a negative terminal (− pole). Interconnection of electrical device nearly always require correct polarity to be maintained. Correct polarity is essential for the operation of vacuum tube and semiconductor devices, many electric motors, electrochemical cells, electrical instruments, and other devices. Current direction Conventional current flows from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole. Electrons flow from negative to positive. In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive. In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and the direction of the current (electron flow) reverses periodically. Conventions for identification Polarity symbols are used where the polarity of a terminal or wire must be identified. An electrical color code or other conventions may be used. In DC circuits, the positive pole is usually marked red (or \\"+\\") and the negative pole is usually marked black (or \\"−\\"), but other color schemes are sometimes used in automotive and telecommunications systems. On a car battery, the positive pole usually has a larger diameter than the negative pole. Modern cars have the negative terminal of the battery connected to the vehicle's body, and the positive terminal provides the live wire to the various systems. Older cars were built with the positive terminal of the battery bonded to the chassis. AC systems In AC systems the two wires of a circuit alternate polarity many times per second. In electrical power systems, all wires carrying the same instantaneous polarity at any moment will have a common identifying marking scheme, such as wire color. Depending on the conventions used for wiring the power system, the color coding or other marking may also indicate additional properties of the conductor, such as its role as neutral in a power circuit. In a polyphase AC system, identifying the wires belonging to a common phase is important to ensure proper operation of the circuit.Wilford Summers, (ed)., American Electricians' Handbook Eleventh Edition, McGraw Hill, 1987, pp. 7-46 through 7-47 Where alternating current circuits are used to carry signals such as audio, polarity is also required to ensure proper function of the system. For example, a set of loudspeakers used for stereo music reproduction will have all device terminals and wiring marked to ensure the same instantaneous polarity, so that the resulting sound produced by each speaker element is in the same phase and add correctly at the listener's ear. Testing for polarity Instruments such as analog voltmeters will indicate up-scale when the instrument's negative lead is connected to the negative pole of a device under test, and the positive lead to the positive terminal. A reversed analog instrument will indicate down-scale, forcing the pointer against the scale end stop; this may damage a sensitive instrument. Digital instruments may indicate reverse polarity of connection with a minus sign before the numerical measurement. A test light using a neon glow lamp will indicate polarity by inspection of the glow around the lamp electrodes; the electrode connected to the negative pole of the circuit will have a glow around it. A neon lamp connected to AC will have a glow visible at both terminals.Wilford I Summers, American Electricians' Handbook, Eleventh edition, McGraw Hill, 1987, , page 1-55 Testing of polarity in alternating current system can be done by an instrument such as a dual-trace oscilloscope that can identify when two points have instantaneously similar voltages, or by measurement between terminals with a voltmeter. If the two points are of the same polarity ( \\"in-phase\\"), voltage will be a minimum.

The parish includes the hamlet of Wick where Wick Farmhouse dates from the mid 18th century. History It has been suggested that the name means 'a suitable home' from the Old English ge-limplic and ham. More probable is a combination of a personal name beginning \\"Lin-\\" or something like \\"lind- pyll\\" (pool where lime trees grow) with \\"ham\\" (in Old English this usually means either \\"village\\" or \\"estate\\"). The first appearance of the name in records is in 1086 Domesday Survey: It is certain that King William laid a heavy hand on the estates of the monastery—'quamplures ex suis commilitionibus ex Glastoniæ feudavit possessionibus.' (fn. 34) Malmesbury does not tell us of the losses but only the fact that afterwards the Conqueror relented somewhat towards this old English monastery, and gave back the estates of Podimore, Milton, Fullbrook, Berrow, Burrington, Lympelesham, Blackford and Wootton. At the time of the Conquest the monks suffered the loss of some of their estates, but these were afterwards recovered and even William the Conqueror made reparation for what he had robbed them of. The possessions of the abbey amounted to the huge extent of 818 hides. The 'twelve hides' consisting of the site, precincts and immediate demesne of the abbey was regarded as an ungeldable and unhidated liberty of which the islands of Meare, Panborough, and Edgarley formed part. As far as these estates lay in Somerset the details of the endowment will be found in the account of the Survey A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2 Edited by William Page. It is likely that efforts were made to improve the drainage of the soil in the area during the Saxon period. In 1129, the Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey recorded that corn was growing here on land which had previously been classified as worthless. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Axbridge Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

They are located in the pontine tegmentum in the brainstem. They both are examples of cranial nerve nuclei. The superior salivatory nucleus innervates the submandibular gland and the sublingual gland and is part of the facial nerve The inferior salivatory nucleus innervates the parotid gland by way of the otic ganglion and forms the parasympathetic component of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Superior salivatory nucleus The superior salivatory nucleus (or nucleus salivatorius superior) of the facial nerve is a visceromotor cranial nerve nucleus located in the pontine tegmentum. It is one of the salivatory nuclei. Parasympathetic efferent fibers of the facial nerve (preganglionic fibers) arise according to some authors from the small cells of the facial nucleus, or according to others from a special nucleus of cells scattered in the reticular formation, dorso-medial to the facial nucleus – the superior salivatory nucleus. Some of the preganglionic fibers travel along the greater petrosal nerve through the pterygoid canal, where they join the postsynaptic fibers of the deep petrosal nerve to become the nerve of the pterygoid canal. These fibers synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, whereupon the postganglionic, postsynaptic, efferent fibers travel to innervate the lacrimal gland and the mucosal glands of the nose, palate, and pharynx. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are also distributed partly via the chorda tympani and lingual nerves to the submandibular ganglion, thence by postganglionic (vasodilator) fibers to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. The term \\"lacrimal nucleus\\" is sometimes used to refer to a portion of the superior salivatory nucleus. Inferior salivatory nucleus The inferior salivatory nucleus (or nucleus salivatorius inferior) is a cluster of neurons in the pontine tegmentum (dorsal part of the pons), just above its junction with the medulla. It is the general visceral efferent (GVE) component of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplying the parasympathetic input to the parotid gland for salivation. It lies immediately caudal to the superior salivatory nucleus and just above the upper end of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibres originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve. They leave the glossopharngeal nerve by its tympanic branch and then pass via the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion. Here, the fibres synapse, and the postganglionic fibers pass by communicating branches to the auriculotemporal nerve, which conveys them to the parotid gland. They produce vasodilator and secretomotor effects. =Function= Parasympathetic input from fibers of the inferior salivatory nucleus stimulates the parotid gland to produce vasodilation and secrete saliva.

While attending Texas A&M; University, he set a Southwest Conference record in the pole vault and played football at the quarterback position for the Aggies football team in 1930. From 1931 to 1945, Stiteler was a high school football coach in Texas, leading teams from Corpus Christi and Waco to state championships. He was the head football coach at Texas A&M; from 1948 to 1950. Athlete Stiteler attended Texas A&M; University from 1927 to 1931. He lettered in track three times and broke the Southwest Conference record in the pole vault. He tried out for the football team in his senior year and, despite weighing only 137 pounds, became the number two quarterback for the Aggies in 1930. Coaching career =High school football coach= After graduating from Texas A&M;, Stiteler served as a high school football coach from 1931 to 1945. He began his coaching career at Smithville, Texas (1931–1933), and later coached high school teams in Bellville (1934–1937), Corpus Christi (1938–1941), and Waco (1942–1945). In 15 years as a high school football coach, Stiteler's teams won ten district championships, two regional championships, a Texas state championship with Corpus Christi in 1938, and a tie for another state championship with Waco in 1945. His 1938 Corpus Christi team finished the season 13–0–1, outscored opponents 466–85, and won the state championship in front of 21,000 spectators at the Cotton Bowl. His record from 1934 to 1938 was 55–1–2. He was the president of the Texas High School Coaches Association in 1942. =Rice Institute= In February 1946, after leading Waco to the Texas football co- championship in 1945, Stiteler was hired by Rice Institute as an assistant football coach. Rice head coach Jess Neely hired Stiteler to fill a vacancy created when backfield coach Buster Brannon resigned to take a position at the University of Florida. Stiteler helped lead the 1946 Rice Owls football team to a 9–2 record and a victory over the Tennessee Volunteers in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1947. =Texas A&M;= Stiteler returned to his alma mater in July 1947 as the backfield coach for the Texas A&M; Aggies football team. In December 1947, he was hired as the head coach for the Texas A&M; football team following the resignation of Homer Norton. In his first season as head coach, the Aggies failed to win a game, accumulating a record of 0–9–1. For the 1949 season, the Aggies won only one game and had a record of 1–8–1. Despite the poor record in his first two seasons, Stiteler developed a reputation as a good recruiter. In 1950, Stiteler turned the program around with a 7–4 record, including impressive wins over Arkansas (42–13) and SMU (25–20) and a 40–20 win over Georgia in the Presidential Cup Bowl at Baltimore. The 1950 team had the best record of any Texas A&M; football team in the first decade after World War II (1945–1954). In December 1950, Stiteler reported that he had been attacked and beaten by a stranger near the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, where Stiteler had been scheduled to address a group of Texas A&M; alumni. Stiteler tried to downplay the incident, but the press reported Stiteler declined to provide details to the police and that there were conflicting versions as to what had happened. The San Antonio Light reported the incident under a banner headline, \\"MYSTERY SHROUDS STITELER BEATING.\\" In March 1951, Stiteler admitted that he had misrepresented the facts concerning the assault. He reported that he had known his attacker and \\"the affair was a personal one.\\" Stiteler submitted his letter of resignation to the President of Texas A&M; upon revealing the true facts concerning \\"my affair in Houston.\\" Following the resignation, the members of the football team issued a statement in support of their former coach: > \\"We believe that whatever happened to Mr. Stiteler was a personal matter and > it should have remained that. A lot of us boys came to A. and M. in 1948 not > because A. and M. had won games but simply because of Harry Stiteler and his > character. He has never ceased to set us that same example in the years we > have played and worked for him.\\" In three years as the head coach at Texas A&M;, Stiteler compiled a record of 8–21–2.

It is most commonly used in the field of automatic speech recognition, where the analysis tries to identify any speech within the audio. The term ‘audio mining’ is sometimes used interchangeably with audio indexing, phonetic searching, phonetic indexing, speech indexing, audio analytics, speech analytics, word spotting, and information retrieval. Audio indexing, however, is mostly used to describe the pre-process of audio mining, in which the audio file is broken down into a searchable index of words. History Academic research on audio mining began in the late 1970s in schools like Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas. Audio data indexing and retrieval began to receive attention and demand in the early 1990s, when multimedia content started to develop and the volume of audio content significantly increased. Before audio mining became the mainstream method, written transcripts of audio content were created and manually analyzed. Process Audio mining is typically split into four components: audio indexing, speech processing and recognition systems, feature extraction and audio classification. The audio will typically be processed by a speech recognition system in order to identify word or phoneme units that are likely to occur in the spoken content. This information may either be used immediately in pre-defined searches for keywords or phrases (a real-time \\"word spotting\\" system), or the output of the speech recognizer may be stored in an index file. One or more audio mining index files can then be loaded at a later date in order to run searches for keywords or phrases. The results of a search will normally be in terms of hits, which are regions within files that are good matches for the chosen keywords. The user may then be able to listen to the audio corresponding to these hits in order to verify if a correct match was found. =Audio Indexing= In audio, there is the main problem of information retrieval - there is a need to locate the text documents that contain the search key. Unlike humans, a computer is not able to distinguish between the different types of audios such as speed, mood, noise, music or human speech - an effective searching method is needed. Hence, audio indexing allows efficient search for information by analyzing an entire file using speech recognition. An index of content is then produced, bearing words and their locations done through content-based audio retrieval, focusing on extracted audio features. It is done through mainly two methods: Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) and Phonetic-based Indexing. Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognizers (LVCSR) In text-based indexing or large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), the audio file is first broken down into recognizable phonemes. It is then run through a dictionary that can contain several hundred thousand entries and matched with words and phrases to produce a full text transcript. A user can then simply search a desired word term and the relevant portion of the audio content will be returned. If the text or word could not be found in the dictionary, the system will choose the next most similar entry it can find. The system uses a language understanding model to create a confidence level for its matches. If the confidence level be below 100 percent, the system will provide options of all the found matches. =Advantages and disadvantages= The main draw of LVCSR is its high accuracy and high searching speed. In LVCSR, statistical methods are used to predict the likelihood of different word sequences, hence the accuracy is much higher than the single word lookup of a phonetic search. If the word can be found, the probability of the word spoken is very high. Meanwhile, while initial processing of audio takes a fair bit of time, searching is quick as just a simple test to text matching is needed. On the other hand, LVCSR is susceptible to common issues of speech recognition. The inherent random nature of audio and problems of external noise all affect the accuracies of text-based indexing. Another problem with LVCSR is its over reliance on its dictionary database. LVCSR only recognizes words that are found in their dictionary databases, and these dictionaries and databases are unable to keep up with the constant evolving of new terminology, names and words. Should the dictionary not contain a word, there is no way for the system to identify or predict it. This reduces the accuracy and reliability of the system. This is named the Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Audio mining systems try to cope with OOV by continuously updating the dictionary and language model used, but the problem still remains significant and has probed a search for alternatives. Additionally, due to the need to constantly update and maintain task-based knowledge and large training databases to cope with the OOV problem, high computational costs are incurred. This makes LVCSR an expensive approach to audio mining. Phonetic-based Indexing Phonetic- based indexing also breaks the audio file into recognizable phonemes, but instead of converting them to a text index, they are kept as they are and analyzed to create a phonetic-based index. The process of phonetic-based indexing can be split into two phases. The first phase is indexing. It begins by converting the input media into a standard audio representation format (PCM). Then, an acoustic model is applied to the speech. This acoustic model represents characteristics of both an acoustic channel (an environment in which the speech was uttered and a transducer through which it was recorded) and a natural language (in which human beings expressed the input speech). This produces a corresponding phonetic search track, or phonetic audio track (PAT), a highly compressed representation of the phonetic content of the input media. The second phase is searching. The user’s search query term is parsed into a possible phoneme string using a phonetic dictionary. Then, multiple PAT files can be scanned at high speed during a single search for likely phonetic sequences that closely match corresponding strings of phonemes in the query term. =Advantages and disadvantages= Phonetic indexing is most attractive as it is largely unaffected by linguistic issues such as unrecognized words and spelling errors. Phonetic preprocessing maintains an open vocabulary that does not require updating. That makes it particularly useful for searching specialized terminology or words in foreign languages that do not commonly appear in dictionaries. It is also more effective for searching audio files with disruptive background noise and/or unclear utterances as it can compile results based on the sounds it can discern, and should the user wish to, they can search through the options till they find the desired item. Furthermore, in contrast to LVCSR, it can process audio files very quickly as there are very few unique phonemes between languages. However, phonemes cannot be effectively indexed like an entire word, thus searching on a phonetic-based system is slow. An issue with phonetic indexing is its low accuracy. Phoneme-based searches result in more false matches than text-based indexing. This is especially prevalent for short search terms, which have a stronger likelihood of sounding similar to other words or being part of bigger words. It could also return irrelevant results from other languages. Unless the system recognizes exactly the entire word, or understands phonetic sequences of languages, it is difficult for phonetic- based indexing to return accurate findings. =Speech processing and recognition system= Deemed as the most critical and complex component of audio mining, speech recognition requires the knowledge of human speech production system and its modeling. To correspond the Human speech production system, the electrical speech production system is developed to consist of: *Speech generation *Speech perception *Voiced & unvoiced speech *Model of human speech The electrical speech production system converts acoustic signal into corresponding representation of the spoken through the acoustic models in their software where all phonemes are represented. A statistical language model aids in the process by identifying how likely words are to follow each other in certain languages. Put together with a complex probability analysis, the speech recognition system is capable of taking an unknown speech signal and transcribing it into words based on the program’s dictionary. ASR (automatic speech recognition) system includes: * Acoustic analysis: input sound waveform is transformed into a feature Acoustic model: establishes relationship between speech signal and phonemes, pronunciation model and language model. Training algorithms are applied to the speech database to create statistical representation of each phoneme, thus generating an acoustic model with a set of phonemes and their probability measures. Pronunciation model: Phonemes are mapped to specific words Language model: Words are organized to form meaningful sentences Some applications of speech processing includes speech recognition, speech coding, speaker authentication, speech enhancement and speech synthesis. =Feature extraction= Prerequisite to the entire speech recognition process, feature extraction must be established first within the system. Audio files must be processed from start to end, ensuring no important information is lost. By differentiating sound sources through pitch, timbral features, rhythmic features, inharmonicity, autocorrelation and other features based on the signal’s predictability, statistical pattern, and dynamic characteristics. Enforcing standardization within feature extraction is regulated through the international MPEG-7 standard features, where features for audio or speech signal classification are fixed in terms of techniques used to analyze and represent raw data in terms of certain features. Standard speech extraction techniques: * Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) estimates current speech sample by analyzing previous speech sample Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) represents speech signal through parametric form using mel scale Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) takes human speech into consideration However, the three techniques are not ideal as non-stationary signals are ignored. Non-stationary signals can be analyzed using Fourier and short-time Fourier, while time- varying signals are analyzed using Wavelet and Discrete wavelet transform (DWT). =Audio Classification= Audio classification is a form of supervised learning, and involves the analysis of audio recordings. It is split into several categories- acoustic data classification, environmental sound classification, musical classification, and natural language utterance classification. The features often used for this process are pitch, timbral features, rhythmic features, inharmonicity, and audio correlation, although other features may also be used. There are several methods to audio classification using existing classifiers, such as the k-Nearest Neighbors, or the naïve Bayes classifier. Using annotated audio data, machines learn to identify and classify the sounds. There has also been research into using deep neural networks for speech recognition and audio classification, due to their effectiveness in other fields such as image classification. One method of using DNNs is by converting audio files into image files, by way of spectrograms in order to perform classification. Applications of Audio Mining Audio mining is used in areas such as musical audio mining (also known as music information retrieval), which relates to the identification of perceptually important characteristics of a piece of music such as melodic, harmonic or rhythmic structure. Searches can then be carried out to find pieces of music that are similar in terms of their melodic, harmonic and/or rhythmic characteristics. Within the field of linguistics, audio mining has been used for phonetic processing and semantic analysis. The efficiency of audio mining in processing audio-visual data lends aid in speaker identification and segmentation, as well as text transcription. Through this process, speech can be categorized in order to identify information, or to extract information through keywords spoken in the audio. In particular, this has been used for speech analytics. Call centers have used the technology to conduct real time analysis by identifying changes in tone, sentiment or pitch, amongst others, which is then processed by decision engine or artificial intelligence to take further action. Further use has been seen in areas of speech recognition and text-to-speech applications. It has also been used in conjunction with video mining, in projects such as mining movie data.

Note that there is also a concentration gradient of the solvent (green). The particle is moving a diffusiophoretic velocity {\\\\bf v}_{dp}, in a fluid that is stationary far from the particle. The fluid velocity decays from {\\\\bf v}_{dp} for fluid in contact with the surface of the particle, to near zero, within the interface at the particle's surface. Diffusiophoresis is the spontaneous motion of colloidal particles or molecules in a fluid, induced by a concentration gradient of a different substance. In other words, it is motion of one species, A, in response to a concentration gradient in another species, B. Typically, A is colloidal particles which are in aqueous solution in which B is a dissolved salt such as sodium chloride, and so the particles of A are much larger than the ions of B. But both A and B could be polymer molecules, and B could be a small molecule. For example, concentration gradients in ethanol solutions in water move 1 μm diameter colloidal particles with diffusiophoretic velocities {\\\\bf v}_{dp} of order 0.1 to 1 μm/s, the movement is towards regions of the solution with lower ethanol concentration (and so higher water concentration). Both species A and B will typically be diffusing but diffusiophoresis is distinct from simple diffusion: in simple diffusion a species A moves down a gradient in its own concentration. Diffusioosmosis, also referred to as capillary osmosis, is flow of a solution relative to a fixed wall or pore surface, where the flow is driven by a concentration gradient in the solution. This is distinct from flow relative to a surface driven by a gradient in the hydrostatic pressure in the fluid. In diffusioosmosis the hydrostatic pressure is uniform and the flow is due to a concentration gradient. Diffusioosmosis and diffusiophoresis are essentially the same phenomenon. They are both relative motion of a surface and a solution, driven by a concentration gradient in the solution. This motion is called diffusiophoresis when the solution is considered static with particles moving in it due to relative motion of the fluid at the surface of these particles. The term diffusioosmosis is used when the surface is viewed as static, and the solution flows. A well studied example of diffusiophoresis is the motion of colloidal particles in an aqueous solution of an electrolyte solution, where a gradient in the concentration of the electrolyte causes motion of the colloidal particles. Colloidal particles may be hundred of nanometres or larger in diameter, while the interfacial double layer region at the surface of the colloidal particle will be of order the Debye length wide, and this is typically only nanometres. So here, the interfacial width is much smaller than the size of the particle, and then the gradient in the smaller species drives diffusiophoretic motion of the colloidal particles largely through motion in the interfacial double layer. Diffusiophoresis was first studied by Derjaguin and coworkers in 1947.Derjaguin, B.V., Sidorenko, G.P., Zubashenko, E.A. and Kiseleva, E.B. , Kolloid Zh., vol.9, #5, 335–348 (1947).  Applications of diffusiophoresis  Diffusiophoresis, by definition, moves colloidal particles, and so the applications of diffusiophoresis are to situations where we want to move colloidal particles. Colloidal particles are typically between 10 nanometres and a few micrometres in size. Simple diffusion of colloids is fast on lengthscales of a few micrometres, and so diffusiophoresis would not be useful, whereas on lengthscales larger than millimetres, diffusiophoresis may be slow as its speed decreases with decreasing size of the solute concentration gradient. Thus, typically diffusiophoresis is employed on lengthscales approximately in the range a micrometre to a millimetre. Applications include moving particles into or out of pores of that size, and helping or inhibiting mixing of colloidal particles. In addition, solid surfaces that are slowly dissolving will create concentration gradients near them, and these gradients may drive movement of colloidal particles towards or away from the surface. This was studied by Prieve in the context of latex particles being pulled towards, and coating, a dissolving steel surface.  Relationship between difusiophoresis/diffusioosmosis, and thermophoresis, multicomponent diffusion and the Marangoni effect  Diffusiophoresis is an analogous phenomenon to thermophoresis, where a species A moves in response to a temperature gradient. Both diffusiophoresis and thermophoresis are governed by Onsager reciprocal relations. Simply speaking, a gradient in any thermodynamic quantity, such as the concentration of any species, or temperature, will drive motion of all thermodynamic quantities, i.e., motion of all species present, and a temperature flux. Each gradient provides a thermodynamic force that moves the species present, and the Onsager reciprocal relations govern the relationship between the forces and the motions. Diffusiophoresis is a special case of multicomponent diffusion. Multicomponent diffusion is diffusion in mixtures, and diffusiophoresis is the special case where we are interested in the movement of one species that is usually a colloidal particle, in a gradient of a much smaller species, such as dissolved salt such as sodium chloride in water. or a miscible liquid, such as ethanol in water. Thus diffusiophoresis always occurs in a mixture, typically a three- component mixture of water, salt and a colloidal species, and we are interested in the cross-interaction between the salt and the colloidal particle. It is the very large difference in size between the colloidal particle, which may be 1μm across, and the size of the ions or molecules, which are less than 1 nm across, that makes diffusiophoresis closely related to diffusioosomosis at a flat surface. In both cases the forces that drive the motion are largely localised to the interfacial region, which is a few molecules across and so typically of order a nanometer across. Over distances of order a nanometer, there is little difference between the surface of a colloidal particle 1 μm across, and a flat surface. Diffusioosmosis is flow of a fluid at a solid surface, or in other words, flow at a solid/fluid interface. The Marangoni effect is flow at a fluid/fluid interface. So the two phenomena are analogous with the difference being that in diffusioosmosis one of the phases is a solid. Both diffusioosmosis and the Marangoni effect are driven by gradients in the interfacial free energy, i.e., in both cases the induced velocities are zero if the interfacial free energy is uniform in space, and in both cases if there are gradients the velocities are directed along the direction of increasing interfacial free energy. Theory for diffusioosmotic flow of a solution In diffusioosmosis, for a surface at rest the velocity increases from zero at the surface to the diffusioosmotic velocity, over the width of the interface between the surface and the solution. Beyond this distance, the diffusioosmotic velocity does not vary with distance from the surface. The driving force for diffusioosmosis is thermodynamic, i.e., it acts to reduce the free energy if the system, and so the direction of flow is away from surface regions of low surface free energy, and towards regions of high surface free energy. For a solute that adsorbs at surface, diffusioosmotic flow is away from regions of high solute concentration, while for solutes that are repelled by the surface, flow is away from regions of low solute concentration.This schematic illustrates diffusioosmotic flow above a surface in contact with a solution that has a concentration gradient of a solute (red). The flow as a function of height above the surface is shown as black arrows of length proportional to the flow velocity at that height. The flow is left-to-right as this solute is repelled by the surface, and its concentration increases from left-to-right. Therefore, the surface free energy increases right-to-left, which drives flow from right- to-left. For gradients that are not-too-large, the diffusioosmotic slip velocity, i.e., the relative flow velocity far from the surface will be proportional to the gradient in the concentration gradient {\\\\bf v}_{slip}=-K abla c_{sol} where K is a diffusioosmotic coefficient, and c_{sol} is the solute concentration. When the solute is ideal and interacts with a surface in the xy plane at z=0 via a potential \\\\phi_{solute}(z), the coefficient K is given by K=\\\\frac{kT}{\\\\eta}\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}z\\\\left[\\\\exp(-\\\\phi_{solute}/kT)-1\\\\right]{\\\\rm d}z where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and \\\\eta is the viscosity in the interfacial region, assumed to be constant in the interface. This expression assumes that the fluid velocity for fluid in contact with the surface is forced to be zero, by interaction between the fluid and the wall. This is called the no-slip condition. To understand these expressions better, we can consider a very simple model, where the surface simply excludes an ideal solute from an interface of width R, this is would be the Asakura-Oosawa model of an ideal polymer against a hard wall. Then the integral is simply-(1/2)R^2 and the diffusioosmotic slip velocity {\\\\bf v}_{slip}=\\\\frac{kTR^2}{2\\\\eta} abla c_{sol} Note that the slip velocity is directed towards increasing solute concentrations. A particle much larger than R moves with a diffusiophoretic velocity {\\\\bf v}_{dp}=-{\\\\bf v}_{slip} relative to the surrounding solution. So diffusiophoresis moves particles towards lower solute concentrations, in this case. = Derivation of diffusioosmotic velocity from Stokes flow = In this simple model, {\\\\bf v}_{slip} can also be derived directly from the expression for fluid flow in the Stokes limit for an incompressible fluid, which is \\\\eta abla^2{\\\\bf u}= abla p for {\\\\bf u} the fluid flow velocity and p the pressure. We consider an infinite surface in the xy plane at z=0, and enforce stick boundary conditions there, i.e., {\\\\bf u}(x,y,z=0)=(0,0,0). We take the concentration gradient to be along the x axis, i.e., abla c_{sol}=(\\\\partial c_{sol}/\\\\partial x,0,0). Then the only non-zero component of the flow velocity {\\\\bf u} is along x, u_x, and it depends only on height z. So the only non-zero component of the Stokes' equation is \\\\eta\\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2u_x(z)}{\\\\partial z^2}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} In diffusioosmosis, in the bulk of the fluid (i.,e., outside the interface) the hydrostatic pressure is assumed to be uniform (as we expect any gradients to relax away by fluid flow) and so in bulk \\\\mbox{In bulk:}~~~~~~ p=\\\\Pi+p_{solv}=\\\\mbox{constant} for p_{solv}the solvent's contribution to the hydrostatic pressure, and \\\\Pi the contribution of the solute, called the osmotic pressure. Thus in the bulk the gradients obey \\\\mbox{In bulk:}~~~~~~ 0=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Pi}{\\\\partial x}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial p_{solv}}{\\\\partial x} As we have assumed the solute is ideal, \\\\Pi= kTc_{sol}, and so \\\\mbox{In bulk:}~~~~~~ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p_{solv}}{\\\\partial x}=-kT\\\\frac{\\\\partial c_{sol}}{\\\\partial x} Our solute is excluded from a region of width R (the interfacial region) from the surface, and so in interface \\\\Pi=0, and so there p=p_{solv}. Assuming continuity of the solvent contribution into the interface we have a gradient of the hydrostatic pressure in the interface \\\\mbox{In interface:}~~~~~~\\\\frac{\\\\partial p }{\\\\partial x}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial p_{solv}}{\\\\partial x}=-kT\\\\frac{\\\\partial c_{sol}}{\\\\partial x} i.e., in the interface there is a gradient of the hydrostatic pressure equal to the negative of the bulk gradient in the osmotic pressure. It is this gradient in the interface in the hydrostatic pressure p that creates the diffusioosmotic flow. Now that we have \\\\partial p/\\\\partial x, we can substitute into the Stokes equation, and integrate twice, then \\\\mbox{In interface:}~~~~~~u_x(z)= -\\\\frac{kT z^2}{2\\\\eta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial c_{sol}}{\\\\partial x}+Az+B \\\\mbox{In bulk:}~~~~~~u_x(z)=Cz+D where A, B, C and D are integration constants. Far from the surface the flow velocity must be a constant, so C=0. We have imposed zero flow velocity at z=0, so B=0. Then imposing continuity where the interface meets the bulk, i.e., forcing u_x(z) and \\\\partial u_x(z)/\\\\partial z to be continuous at z=R we determine A and D, and so get \\\\mbox{In interface:}~~~~~~u_x(z)= \\\\frac{kTR^2}{2\\\\eta}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c_{sol}}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{2z}{R}-\\\\frac{z^2}{R^2}\\\\right) \\\\mbox{In bulk:}~~~~~~u_x(z)=\\\\frac{kTR^2}{2\\\\eta}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c_{sol}}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)=v_{slip} Which gives, as it should, the same expression for the slip velocity, as above. This result is for a specific and very simple model, but it does illustrate general features of diffusioosmoisis: 1) the hydrostatic pressure is, by definition (flow induced by pressure gradients in the bulk is a common but separate physical phenomenon) uniform in the bulk, but there is a gradient in the pressure in the interface, 2) this pressure gradient in the interface causes the velocity to vary in the direction perpendicular to the surface, and this results in a slip velocity, i.e., for the bulk of the fluid to move relative to the surface, 3) away from the interface the velocity is constant, this type of flow is sometimes called plug flow.  Diffusiophoresis in salt solutions  In many applications of diffusiophoresis, the motion is driven by gradients in the concentration of a salt (electrolyte) concentration, such as sodium chloride in water. Colloidal particles in water are typically charged, and there is an electrostatic potential, called a zeta potential at their surface. This charged surface of the colloidal particle interacts with a gradient in salt concentration, and this gives rise to diffusiophoretic velocity {\\\\bf U} given by {\\\\bf U}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\eta}\\\\left[\\\\frac{kT}{e}\\\\beta\\\\zeta+\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^2}{8}\\\\right] abla \\\\ln c_{salt} where \\\\epsilon is the permittivity of water, \\\\eta is the viscosity of water, \\\\zeta is the zeta potential of the colloidal particle in the salt solution, \\\\beta=(D_+-D_-)/(D_++D_-)is the reduced difference between the diffusion constant of the positively charged ion, D_+, and the diffusion constant of the negatively charged ion, D_-, and c_{salt} is the salt concentration. abla \\\\ln c_{salt}is the gradient, i.e., rate of change with position, of the logarithm of the salt concentration, which is equivalent to the rate of change of the salt concentration, divided by the salt concentration – it is effectively one over the distance over which the concentration decreases by a factor of e. The above equation is approximate, and only valid for 1:1 electrolytes such as sodium chloride. Note that there are two contributions to diffusiophoresis of a charged particle in a salt gradient, which give rise to the two terms in the above equation for {\\\\bf U}. The first is due to the fact that whenever there is a salt concentration gradient, then unless the diffusion constants of the positive and negative ions are exactly equal to each other, there is an electric field, i.e., the gradient acts a little like a capacitor. This electric filed generated by the salt gradient drives electrophoresis of the charged particle, just as an externally applied electric field does. This gives rise to the first term in the equation above, i.e., diffusiophoresis at a velocity (\\\\epsilon/\\\\eta)(kT/e)\\\\beta\\\\zeta abla \\\\ln c_{salt}. The second part is due to the surface free energy of the surface of a charged particle, decreasing with increasing salt concentration, this is a similar mechanism to that found in diffusiophoresis in gradients of neutrial substances. This gives rise to the second part of the diffusiophoretic velocity (\\\\epsilon\\\\zeta^2/8\\\\eta) abla \\\\ln c_{salt}. Note that this simple theory predicts that this contribution to the diffusiophoretic motion is always up a salt concentration gradient, it always moves particles towards higher salt concentration. By contrast, the sign of the electric-field contribution to diffusiophoresis depends on the sign of \\\\beta\\\\zeta. So for example, for a negatively charged particle, \\\\zeta<0, and if the positively charged ions diffuse faster than the negatively charged ones, then this term will push particles down a salt gradient, but if it is the negatively charged ions that diffuse faster, then this term pushes the particles up the salt gradient. Practical applications A group from Princeton University reported the application of diffusiophoresis to water purification. Contaminated water is treated with CO2 to create carbonic acid, and to split the water into a waste stream and a potable water stream. This allows for easy ionic separation of suspended particles. This has huge energy cost and time savings opportunity to make drinking water safe compared to traditional water filtration methods for dirty water sources.

History Spaxton was part of the hundred of Cannington. The modern parish includes the ancient parishes of Aisholt and Charlynch. Aisholt is one of the Thankful Villages - those villages that suffered no fatalities during the Great War of 1914–1918. The name of Spaxton originates from \\"Spakr\\", a Dane who settled in the area in about the 9th century. An alternative derivation relies on it being recorded as Spacheston in the Domesday Book, meaning 'The councillor's enclosure', from the Old English spæcas and tun. It was the property of Alfred of Spain. During the 19th century, Henry James Prince, former curate of Charlynch founded the notorious religious cult of the Agapemone at Four Forks. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography Near the village is Hawkridge Reservoir which supplies water for Bridgwater, constructed between 1960 and 1962, and the Ashford Reservoir which was constructed in 1932. Landmarks and Notable Buildings * Gothelney Hall at Gothelney Green was built in the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. * Barford Park is in the South of the parish. * Parts of Court Farm near St Margaret's Church date from c.1500 Religious sites * The Church of St Margaret has some parts from the 12th and 13th centuries but is predominantly from the 15th century, and was restored in 1895. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. * The Church of All Saints, Aisholt dates from the 14th and 15th centuries. * In Charlynch (or Charlinch) the Church of St Mary has been deconsecrated. * The Methodist Chapel is on the main road through the village.

It is commonly discussed in the context of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This attack uses the potential of the two different protocols meaningfully communicating commands and data. It was popularized in 2007 and publicly described in research of the same year. The general class of attacks that it refers to has been known since at least 1994 (see the Security Considerations section of RFC 1738). Internet protocol implementations allow for the possibility of encapsulating exploit code to compromise a remote program which uses a different protocol. Inter-protocol exploitation can utilize inter-protocol communication to establish the preconditions for launching an inter-protocol exploit. For example, this process could negotiate the initial authentication communication for a vulnerability in password parsing. Inter-protocol exploitation is where one protocol attacks a service running a different protocol. This is a legacy problem because the specifications of the protocols did not take into consideration an attack of this type. Technical details The two protocols involved in the vulnerability are termed the carrier and target. The carrier encapsulates the commands and/or data. The target protocol is used for communication to the intended victim service. Inter-protocol communication will be successful if the carrier protocol can encapsulate the commands and/or data sufficiently to meaningfully communicate to the target service. Two preconditions need to be met for successful communication across protocols: encapsulation and error tolerance. The carrier protocol must encapsulate the data and commands in a manner that the target protocol can understand. It is highly likely that the resulting data stream with induce parsing errors in the target protocol. The target protocol be must be sufficiently forgiving of errors. During the inter-protocol connection it is likely that a percentage of the communication will be invalid and cause errors. To meet this precondition, the target protocol implementation must continue processing despite these errors. Current implications One of the major points of concern is the potential for this attack vector to reach through firewalls and DMZs. Inter- protocol exploits can be transmitted over HTTP and launched from web browsers on an internal subnet. An important point is the web browser is not exploited through any conventional means. Example JavaScript delivered over HTTP and communicating over the IRC protocol. var form = document.createElement('form'); form.setAttribute('method', 'post'); form.setAttribute('action', 'http://irc.example.net:6667'); form.setAttribute('enctype', 'multipart/form-data'); var textarea = document.createElement('textarea'); textarea.innerText = \\"USER A B C D NICK turtle JOIN #hack PRIVMSG #hackers: I like turtles \\"; form.appendChild(textarea); document.body.appendChild(form); form.submit(); Known examples of the vulnerability were also demonstrated on files constructed to be valid HTML code and BMP image at the same time.

It featured the SK Wyverns, who had claimed home ground advantage by finishing in first place at the end of the season, and the Doosan Bears, who had finished second and had swept the Hanhwa Eagles in a best-of-5 playoff series to advance to the next round. The SK Wyverns won the series in six games, after becoming the first team in Korean Series history to claim victory after losing the first two games. The series was also notable for the inability of teams to win at their home grounds (just one home victory out of the six games) and for some unsavory and aggressive incidents between the two teams that marred the first three games. Game 1, 22 October Munhak Baseball Stadium, Incheon The first game of the series began at the home stadium of the Wyverns, but they failed to take advantage as Doosan completed a 2-0 shutout victory, thanks to the pitching of their ace Daniel Rios. Kenny Rayburn started for the Wyverns but was unable to emulate Rios's feat of giving up only 4 hits and 1 walk. The game also saw two instances of Doosan batters being struck by pitches, which would become an issue in the next game. Doosan scored their first run in the first inning. Lee Jong-wook was the lead- off runner, and Ko Young-min drove him in with a double. They added to their score in the fifth, when Lee walked in again off a Kim Dong-joo sacrifice fly with the bases loaded. Rayburn lasted six innings, with five more pitchers coming out of the bullpen over the next three innings to try to keep the score at 2-0. Rios, with a superb performance, pitched the full nine innings, throwing 99 pitches to get the win. Game 2, 23 October Munhak Baseball Stadium, Incheon Doosan took a 2-0 lead in the series with the aid of some strong batting and some sloppy Wyverns defensive work. An incident occurred before the game started, with Doosan officials suspecting that the Wyverns had hidden a camera beneath the first base fence to steal signs, which was later proven false as the 'camera' turned out to be a sewer. Tensions spilled onto the field as three more Doosan batters were struck by pitches, making a total of five over the two games. Benches cleared in the sixth inning when Doosan batter Kim Dong-joo was struck by a pitch from starter Chae Byeong-yong, delaying the game for six minutes. The incident proved to be a turning point, as Doosan scored three more runs in the inning to achieve the final scoreline of 6-3. The game began well for SK as first-baseman Lee Ho-jun hit a two-run home run in the first to put the score at 2-0. Doosan responded in the third with a two-run shot of their own from second-baseman Ko Young-min. They took the lead in the fifth with another home run when catcher Chae Sang-byung scored with two out to give Doosan a slender advantage. SK fought back almost immediately with the fourth and final home run of the game off the bat of left-fielder Cho Dong-hwa. In the top of the sixth, Ko Young-min reached first with a lead-off single, and advanced to second after Kim Dong-joo was struck by the bench-clearing pitch. A single from former Wyverns shortstop Lee Dae-su got both of them home and Chae Sang-byung added a sixth when his double scored Lee. Doosan's starter Matt Randall came away with the win. Game 3, 25 October Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Doosan returned home to their stadium in Jamsil with a 2-0 series lead. This was significant as no team in Korean Series history had won after losing the first two games. Based on the form of the teams in the first two games, it looked as though a sweep was inevitable. In this game, however, there was a remarkable reversal of fortunes as SK struck back significantly to win 9-1. Doosan, who had been confident and aggressive in the first two games, suddenly looked hesitant and ineffective. The Wyverns put slugger Kim Jae-hyeon back into the batting order as their DH, and it immediately paid dividends. Wyverns shortstop Jeong Keun-woo got on with a lead-off single, and Kim scored him with a double to right field. Park Jae-hong got Kim home with a single to put the Wyverns up 2-0, the way they had begun in the last game. The pitching duel continued between Wyverns starter Michael Romano and Doosan's Kim Myeong-jae as neither of them allowed any more runs up until the top of the sixth. There, Doosan suddenly imploded, as shortstop Lee Dae-su, who had been hailed for his efforts in the previous two games, made a string of bad errors including dropped catches and mis- judged base throws to allow multiple SK batters to score or get on base. An attempted home steal by Jeong Keun-woo was also successful as keeper Chae Sang-byung mishandled a pitch by reliever Lee Hei-chun, also allowing Cho Dong-hwa to score from second. Doosan pulled a run back when Ko Young-min scored Lee Jong-wook with a single in the bottom of the sixth, but they would not manage to post another run after that, and SK ran out winners with the scoreline substantially in their favor. Game 4, 26 October Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Game 4 saw the return of Daniel Rios for Doosan, and it was widely assumed that his return would restore stability to the team. Meanwhile, SK announced the shock appointment of rookie pitcher Kim Kwang-hyun in place of expected pitcher Kenny Rayburn who had competed admirably with Rios in the first game. It appeared that SK were going to throw the game, take a 3-1 series deficit against a seemingly un-hittable Rios and fight back with a fresher pitching rotation. But Kim managed to stage what must be one of the most remarkable performances in the history of the Korean Series, giving up only one hit in 7⅓ innings. On the other hand, Rios only lasted for five innings, giving up nine hits and three earned runs. Doosan's bullpen reclaimed a hold on the game, but they were unable to score any runs and suffered their first shutout loss of the series. SK continued their habit of scoring early as Kim Jae-hyeon again opened the scoring with a double to bring in Jeong Keun- woo in the first. Doosan's bats struggled, only managing to get on base with two walks and a hit over five innings. SK were getting runners most innings, but were unable to take advantage until the fifth, when back-to-back home runs from Cho Dong-hwa and Kim Jae-hyun put them up 3-0. Wyverns third baseman Choi Jeong made it four when his single brought in Jeong Kyeong-bae who had walked to first and advanced on a bunt from Park Kyung-oan. Doosan were unable to fare any better against the Wyverns relievers Cho Woong-cheon and Ka Deuk- yeom, and their hit in the sixth inning remained their only hit for the night. Game 5, 27 October Jamsil Baseball Stadium, Seoul Game 5 was played on a beautiful Saturday afternoon at the Jamsil stadium. Kenny Rayburn returned for the Wyverns; he faced Matt Randall. This game turned out to be the most competitive since the first game. Rayburn and Randall each pitched 6 innings giving up no runs; Rayburn had only 3 hits to Randall's 5 but he did give up 6 walks compared to Randall's 2. The game was to be decided by the bullpens, with Cho Woong-cheon coming on for the Wyverns and Im Tae-hoon for the Bears. Both got through the seventh unscathed, but an error in the top of the eight by second-baseman Ko Young-min with a misjudged throw to first base allowed leadoff batter Cho Dong-hwa to get onto second. Kim Jae-hyeon continued his excellent post-season form with a massive triple to open the scoring for SK. He was brought in by another Lee Ho-jun double to make the score 2-0. Speedy Kim Kang-min made it three with yet another double, and after managing to advance to third, walked in for an easy fourth run after a wild pitch from new reliever Lee Hei-chun rounded out the scoring for the game. SK was now positioned to win the series up three games to two, and with the next two games to be played at their home ground in Incheon. They had completely swung the momentum in their favour, and Doosan had scored only once during the whole three games they had played at home. Game 6, 29 October Munhak Baseball Stadium, Incheon Game 6 was to prove the final game of the series as SK became the first team of the 2007 Korean Series to win a home game. SK went with Chae Byeong-yong, the losing pitcher of game 2, to start, while Doosan went with rookie reliever Im Tae-hoon in a somewhat surprising role as starting pitcher. Doosan needed a major form reversal to win the game and force a series decider. They showed their intentions early, managing a run after Kim Hyun-Soo was brought home from second by a Kim Dong-joo double. They held the lead until the third innings, when the Wyverns young third-baseman Choi Jeong, who had had a quiet series, managed to get to first, and then a two-run home run by shortstop Jeong Keun-woo put them in front 2-1. Kim Jae-hyeon turned his great post-season form into spectacular post-season form by adding another with a solo shot in the same innings. The scoreline remained 3-1 when Chae Byeong-yong was taken off after 5½ innings of service to bring in their main post-season reliever Cho Woong-cheon, as Doosan tried to claw back the lead. But they struggled for hits, with only a Hong Sung-heon double between innings six to eight to show for their efforts, and things got worse for them in the bottom of the eighth as SK added two more runs. Na Ju-hwan got on base and advanced to second with a Part Kyung-oan grounder, and Choi Jeong's single was enough to bring him home. The next batter, Jeong Keun-woo, walked, and a Cho Dong-hwa double brought home Choi and gave a four-run lead to SK, now up 5-1. Closer Chong Tae-hyon, who had been brought on in the previous inning, was given the task of closing out the game for the championship win. Doosan rallied though, Hong Sung-heon leading-off to first and then scoring on a hit from pinch-hitter Yoo Jae-woong. Another pinch-hitter, Jeon Sang-ryeol, scored a double which only got Yoo as far as third, and that brought Lee Jong-wook to the plate. A home run would have tied up the game and sent it into extra innings, but Chong struck him out to bring the Wyverns their first Korean Series victory in the history of the franchise. Designated hitter Kim Jae- hyeon was named the series MVP. SK, The first won in the Korean Series only eight years. Accessed 2009-09-26. Archived 2009-09-28.

Shortly after the dissolution of the monasteries, the college's hall, chapel and other buildings were surrendered on 10 April 1540 and acquired by Christ Church. Background The Priory first sent 4 monks to study in Oxford in 1311, in a hall it had bought there near the church of St. Peter-in-the-East, but the actual college was founded in 1362 by Simon Islip, archbishop of Canterbury, in the parish of St. Edward, opposite Oriel College.Eleanor Chance, Christina Colvin, Janet Cooper, C J Day, T G Hassall, Mary Jessup and Nesta Selwyn, 'Medieval Oxford', in A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 4, the City of Oxford, ed.

It was to consist of twelve students (initially 4 monks and 8 \\"secular clerks\\" – i.e. ordained clergy who were not monks), under a warden, who would be a monk chosen by the Priory's prior and admitted by the archbishop. Its endowment was granted in 1363, and included the church of Pagham, Sussex, along with (initially) eight Oxford houses' rents and a portion of the rents from Woodford, Northamptonshire and Worminghall, Buckinghamshire, where the Priory had manors. Other endowments came in 1373, 1380, and 1392, eventually coming to about £86 a year, although these all gradually disappeared. The licence to acquire land for building was only given in 1364 though 1365. Islip pulled out the monks and appointed as warden a secular clerk named, John Wycliffe. Then in 1366 Islip's successor as archbishop, Simon Langham, wished to put the monks back in place and litigation at the Roman Curia ensued. In 1368 Langham was appointed Cardinal and his influence induced the Curia to give judgment in favour of the monks in 1370.Knowles, David. The Religious Orders in England, Volume II. Cambridge University Press, 1955, p. 21. One more monk was added in 1383, with the Priory paying for all 5 monks' maintenance at 10 pennies per week per monk. One of its students from Canterbury Priory was Thomas Chillenden, later Prior of the monastery. Rooms were rented to other Benedictine monasteries' members, including Rochester, Coventry, Battle, Peterborough, and Evesham, though all inmates were to a greater or lesser extent subject to Gloucester College's 'prior studentium'. Lay students were occasionally admitted to the college to make up numbers and provide some income. In 1426 the 'prior studentium' complained that Canterbury College's students were breaking Benedictine rules on eating meat. Shortly after the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, the college's hall, chapel and other buildings were surrendered on 10 April 1540 and acquired by Christ Church. In 2019, the Canterbury Institute was founded in Oxford, in memory of Canterbury College, by Dr Dominic Burbidge. The Institute focuses on rediscovering the academic vocation and hosts the Barry Scholarship.

Männerlist was Wagner's last operatic project before he embarked on Rienzi. Although the book of the opera (which Wagner as usual wrote himself) has long been available, the full text (including dialogue) and three completed musical numbers (in piano score), were discovered in a private collection in 1994 and later acquired by the archives of the Richard-Wagner- Stiftung in Bayreuth. Wagner refers to this project in his \\"Red Pocketbook\\" and his autobiographical works A Communication to My Friends (1851) and My Life (1870–1880). In the latter he describes the work as \\"in a light neo- French style,\\" which he began to write in Königsberg, but that later when he took it up in Riga for completion, \\"I was overtaken by utter disgust at this kind of writing.\\" From the complete text and the surviving music, it is clear that the piece was conceived as a Singspiel. The story is drawn from the Arabian Nights, but relocated in 19th-century Germany. The jeweller Julius Wander, pretending to be an aristocrat, is tricked into promising to marry the ugly Aurora, daughter of the class-conscious Baron von Abendthau, by her cousin Leontine.

She was used by the Union Navy primarily as a gunboat stationed off Confederate ports to prevent their trading with foreign countries. Her gallant service with the Union Navy was cut short in 1863 when she ran aground and was destroyed. Built in New York City in 1858 Amanda — a wooden-hulled bark built in 1858 at New York City — was purchased there by the Navy on 6 August 1861. Civil War operations =Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade= Since no logs recording this vessel's operations prior to 7 November 1862 have survived, the date of her commissioning is unknown, but — since she arrived in Hampton Roads on 29 October 1861 and her commanding officer, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Nathaniel Goodwin, reported for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron — we know that her active career began somewhat earlier. =Amandas anchor breaks loose, and she collides with Braziliera= The bark joined the forces blockading Wilmington, North Carolina on 8 November; and, but for occasional runs back to Hampton Roads for provisions and water, she operated off that vital Confederate port through most of the winter. Then, somewhat the worse for wear after battling the constantly rough seas off the North Carolina coast, she headed for the Virginia Capes late in February 1862 and reached Hampton Roads on the evening of the 26th to receive repairs and to obtain fresh provisions. There, during a severe storm on the 3rd of March, she dragged anchor and fouled sister blockader , causing considerable harm to both ships. The need to patch the damage caused by this accident delayed Amandas, return to Wilmington and thus allowed the bark to play a minor, but important, role in the most memorable naval action of the Civil War. A glance back to the early days of the conflict should shed light on her past in this drama. =Merrimack burned by the Union, raised by the Confederate Navy= When Virginia seceded from the Union, the Navy tried to remove its warships from the Norfolk Navy Yard; but sunken light boats obstructed the channel between Craney Island and Sewell's Point and prevented the escape of and several other Federal men-of-war. Therefore, Union sailors put the torch to this screw frigate and scuttled her as they evacuated their strategically important, but untenable, base up Virginia's Elizabeth River. Once in control of the shipyard, Southerners raised this vessel and rebuilt her as an ironclad ram. Renamed CSS Virginia — the former Federal warship — left the Elizabeth on 8 March 1862 and attacked her erstwhile sister ships in Hampton Roads, destroying sailing frigates and . During the engagement, both sailing frigate and steam frigate ran aground, and steam frigate came dangerously close to being likewise stranded as her keel plowed through mud during her maneuvers to move into action. Upon the approach of darkness, Virginia retired behind Sewell's Point and anchored for repairs. =Post-battle scramble to recover and save Union ships= These setbacks to the Union fleet prompted orders to the captain of the powerful chartered tug America to go to the assistance of Minnesota; but her master \\". . . refused to get up steam on the vessel . ...\\" To meet this emergency, Amandas executive officer, Acting Master Richard J. Hoffner and a crew of 12 from the bark boarded the tug and enabled her to join other Union steamships in labors which enabled Roanoke to reach the comparative safety of deeper water. They also refloated Minnesota; but soon she again ran aground. =Monitor arrives to battle with the Virginia= Meanwhile, on the evening of the 8th, Amanda moved to a position near the inner lightship at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay to await the Union Navy's eagerly expected champion, . When that innovative ironclad arrived, Goodwin explained the tactical situation to her commanding officier, Lt. John L. Worden, and permitted Acting Master Samuel Howard to leave the bark temporarily so that he might pilot Monitor to a position close to Minnesota. When Virginia reappeared the following morning, Monitor intercepted the ram as she headed toward Minnesota and checked her advance in an inconclusive ensuing battle which lasted about four hours before Virginia withdrew. =Amanda towed to Baltimore for repairs= That morning, Captain John Marston, the senior Union naval officer in the vicinity, directed Goodwin to proceed without delay in Amanda to Baltimore, Maryland, a safer place in which her repairs could be completed. The dispatch reached Goodwin at noon; and, \\". . . considering it as a peremptory order admitting of no delay . . .\\" he weighed anchor immediately, without waiting for the bark's absent officers and crewmen to return on board. Towed by the steamer , the bark proceeded up Chesapeake Bay and arrived at Baltimore the following day. =Amanda reassigned to the East Gulf Blockade= While she was there, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles reassigned Amanda to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron on 27 March 1862. She reached Key West, Florida, on the night of 18-19 April and promptly began cruising between the Dry Tortugas and Cuba, staying close to the coast of the latter in the hope of intercepting vessels operating between Havana, Cuba, and Confederate ports. During this assignment, which continued into the summer, she captured the Swan some southwest of Tortugas about midday on 24 May. This Confederate steamer had escaped from Mobile, Alabama with 900 bales of cotton and 200 barrels of resin to be delivered to Havana. =Amanda captures a slave trader ship= The bark seized an unnamed slave ship some northwest of Mariel, Cuba. Goodwin arrested and took on board his own ship the 11 men \\". . . all intoxicated and inclined to be troublesome ...\\" who had manned the bark and replaced them with a crew from Amanda who took the prize — which, the day before, had delivered 750 blacks to Cuba — to Key West, Florida. There she was condemned in admiralty court. =Permanently assigned to St. George’s Sound= On 30 June, Goodwin resigned his commission and was relieved by Acting Volunteer Lt. George E. Welch in command of the bark. At this time, Amanda ended her cruising out at sea and took station off the eastern entrance to St. George's Sound, Florida, her area of service for the remainder of her career. =Expedition up the Ocklockonee River= There, on 20 March 1863, Welch — having heard that a schooner in the Ocklockonee River was loading cotton — ordered his executive officer to lead an expedition to that stream to capture this potential blockade runner. That morning, Acting Master Hoffner — with two other officers, a pilot, and 27 men — left the bark and proceeded in her launch and the tender sloop to the mouth of the Ocklockonee which he finally reached after a three-day struggle against heavy seas, contrary winds and tides, and tropical vegetation which clogged the marshy waters of St. George's Sound. Up this small stream, the Union sailors found \\"... a dismasted vessel lying close to [the river's] starboard bank . . . .\\" While the Union party approached the Southern ship, the people who had been on board her escaped to shore in boats. When his party reached the schooner Onward, Hoffner tried to tow her back toward the sound; but, after two hours of rapid rowing, the prize grounded as the tide ebbed. =Under attack by Confederate forces, the expedition fails= Afloat again the next morning, the expedition resumed its movement seaward, but took the wrong channel and soon again struck bottom. The most strenuous efforts failed to free the schooner. About noon, while Hoffner was waiting for the rising tide to refloat Onward, some 40 Confederate horsemen and about three or four times as many foot soldiers appeared and opened fire on the expedition. Some bluejackets fought back with their muskets, others fired the party's howitzer, while the remaining men set fire to the schooner. After fighting for about one and one-half hours, Hoffner ordered his force to escape in the tender and the launch. Both scraped on the bottom but were kept in motion by wading sailors who dragged the boats for about half a mile over mud flats before reaching sufficiently deep water. Throughout the retreat, Confederate riflemen kept the party under fire, killing one man outright and wounding eight others. =Expedition survivors return to Union Navy vessel= Hoffner was among the latter with a Minie ball lodged in his neck. Once both boats were safely afloat, they made for the St. Mark's blockade where they were received on board the Union steamer . =Amanda runs aground and is destroyed= Amanda continued to serve on the blockade of St. George's Sound into the spring. Late in May 1863, the barometer began falling rapidly along the gulf coast; and, by the 27th, the storm had grown to hurricane intensity. Amanda, on blockade duty just inside the east entrance to St. George's Sound, was driven ashore on Dog Island. Two days later, her crew destroyed the bark to prevent her falling into Southern hands.

Singer's work brought together the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce and Roman Jakobson with theoretical streams that had long been flowing in and around the University of Chicago, where Singer taught. In the late 1970s, Michael Silverstein, a young student of Jakobson's at Harvard University, joined Singer in Chicago's Department of Anthropology. Since that time, anthropological work inspired by Peirce's semiotic have proliferated, in part as students of Singer and Silverstein have spread out across the country, developing semiotic-anthropological agendas of their own. Overview Semiotic anthropology has its precursor in Malinowski's contextualism (which may be called anthropological semantics), which was later resumed by John Rupert Firth.Winfried Nöth (1995) Handbook of semiotics p.103 Anthropological approaches to semantics are alternative to the three major types of semantics approaches: linguistic semantics, logical semantics, and general semantics. Other independent approaches to semantics are philosophical semantics and psychological semantics. Elizabeth Mertz has recently reviewed the burgeoning literature in semiotic anthropology (2007). The freshest research in the field refer to the theory of sign setting the aim for the scientific program: \\"Semiotic anthropology, as a research program, sets itself several goals. The first is the establishment of a “cultural theory of signs” as a hypostatic object functioning in higher-order ontologies. The second is reduction of the paradigms of the research on culture to one, merging the philosophical- philological and anthropological-ethnographic perspectives in order to unify methodology and specialize research techniques. In this sense, semiotic anthropology ought to perform an auxiliary function; in other words, semiotics is always the semiotics of something [...]. The third goal is the development of an effective analytical tool for cultural messages such as architecture, painting, eating habits, or fashion, which constitute material reflections of the systems of values of a certain community. Cultural messages have recorded the “world of culture” of people who perceived reality in a certain way. The interpretation of this closed “world of culture” is a difficult but also useful task, as it enables one to better understand the people who created this world.\\" (Boroch 2018: 222).

It took place on 19 February 1811, northwest of Badajoz, Spain, where an outnumbered French force routed and nearly destroyed the Spanish Army of Extremadura. In a bid to help extricate Marshal André Masséna's army from its position in Portugal—mired in front of Lisbon's defensive Lines of Torres Vedras—Marshal Jean de Dieu Soult led part of the French Armée du Midi (Army of the South) from Andalusia into the neighbouring Spanish region of Extremadura and laid siege to the important fortress town of Badajoz. Viscount Wellington and the Spanish captain-general Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqués de La Romana, sent a large Spanish army to raise the siege. La Romana, however, died before the army could depart, and command fell to General Gabriel de Mendizábal Iraeta. Supported by a small force of Portuguese cavalry, the Spaniards reached the town and camped on the nearby heights of San Cristóbal in early February 1811. When Mendizabal ignored Wellington's instructions and failed to entrench his army, Soult took advantage of the vulnerable Spanish position and sent a small force to attack the Spaniards. On the morning of 19 February, French forces under Marshal Édouard Mortier quickly defeated the Spanish army, inflicting 1,000 casualties and taking 4,000 prisoners while losing only 400 men. The victory allowed Soult to concentrate on his assault of Badajoz, which fell to the French on 11 March and remained in French hands until the following year.  Background  Despite his partial victory over Marshal Masséna in Portugal at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810, Viscount Wellington was forced by Masséna's manoeuvres to retreat behind the extensive lines of Torres Vedras, a series of forts defending the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. By 10 October 1810, only the British light division and a few cavalry patrols remained outside the defensive lines, while Masséna's Army of Portugal concentrated around Sobral, seemingly in preparation to attack the lines. After a fierce skirmish on 14 October, the French dug themselves in rather than launch a full-scale assault, remaining entrenched for a month before withdrawing to a position between Santarém and Rio Maior. Jean de Dieu Soult Napoleon had previously sent dispatches to Marshal Soult, commander of the Army of the South, urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal. However, the Emperor's orders, which called for only a small force, were based on outdated intelligence and the situation had changed considerably by the time Soult received them. Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital, making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible. Nevertheless, compelled to act, Soult instead gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from V Corps, and launched an expedition into Extremadura with the aim of capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz, thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna and the Lines of Torres Vedras. Soult divided his army into two contingents and advanced into Extremadura via the two main passes leading from Andalusia into the Guadiana valley, with the intention of rejoining at Almendralejo. One of the columns, commanded by Gen. Marie Victor Latour-Maubourg, met little resistance on its march; on 3 January 1811 the column was confronted by 2,500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near Usagre, but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish infantry division commanded by Gen. Mendizabal. Latour- Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column. That second column, commanded by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's V Corps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore had to take a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat to the rear of the French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.  Prelude  Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqués de La Romana Soult could not besiege so strong a fortress as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans. Sending his light cavalry under Brig. Gen. André Briche to take Mérida and leaving four squadrons of dragoons at Albuera to watch the garrison at Badajoz, he marched with the remainder of his army to invest Olivenza. Wellington had previously advised Gen. Pedro Caro de La Romana, commander of the Spanish Army of Extremadura, either to destroy the fortification at Olivenza or to repair its defenses and fully garrison it; La Romana in turn had instructed Mendizabal to slight the fortress, but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the garrison with four infantry battalions. Soult, arriving on 11 January, was therefore confronted with a strongly garrisoned—but untenable—fortress. The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on 19 January, and by 22 January a poorly repaired breach in the fortress' walls had been reopened. The garrison surrendered on 23 January, with over 4,000 Spanish troops from the Army of Extremadura taken captive. Soult was now in a difficult position: although he had a large (4,000-strong) contingent of cavalry, deploying two battalions to escort the prisoners taken at Olivenza back to French-held Seville left him only 5,500 infantry with which to continue his campaign. Moreover, although his siege-train had begun to arrive, the continued absence of Gazan's infantry division left him with a weakened army. Despite these problems, Soult decided to besiege Badajoz in hopes that Wellington would send reinforcements to the Spanish fortress and thereby reduce the Allied forces facing Masséna at the Lines of Torres Vedras. On 26 January Soult marched for Badajoz, sending Latour-Maubourg with six cavalry battalions across the Guadiana to blockade the fortress' northern approach, and by 27 January the first siege of Badajoz had begun. Gazan's division eventually rejoined Soult's army on 3 February, further strengthening the besieging force by 6,000 men. Meanwhile, Mendizabal had retreated to the Portuguese border after sending two battalions to reinforce the garrison at Badajoz. Weakened by the defeat at Olivenza and by Ballesteros' continued absence, he sent to La Romana for reinforcements, receiving on 14 January 1,800 men sent from Abrantes under the command of Carlos de España. Additionally, about 6,000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on 19 January, arriving at Elvas ten days later. When these forces joined with Mendizabal's remaining 3,000 men, a Spanish cavalry division and a brigade of Portuguese horse, the Allies had an army almost 15,000 strong—intended to be under the command of La Romana—with which to hold Soult in check. La Romana, however, died of an aneurysm on 23 January, and command of the army then fell to Mendizabal. Before his sudden death, La Romana had met with Wellington and agreed on a plan for the campaign—the army was to entrench on the heights of San Cristóbal, with its right flank protected by the fort of San Cristóbal, its front covered by the Gebora and Guadiana rivers, the left guarded by the fortress at Campo Maior, and Elvas protecting the rear.; , from Wellington's dispatches. Although aware of this plan when he took command, Mendizabal chose to ignore the instructions upon arriving on the north bank of the Guadiana on 5 February. Instead, he stationed the bulk of his infantry in Badajoz, leaving only a small contingent of infantry and his cavalry below San Cristóbal. On 7 February Mendizabal launched a strong sally against the besieging French lines: the Portuguese cavalry, supported by a small group of infantrymen, feinted towards the French left wing while a strong force of 5,000 men attacked the right. The Spaniards under de España drove through the first French parallel to engage one of Gen. Jean-Baptiste Girard's brigades and were only driven back when Mortier sent several battalions to his aid. De España pulled back to Badajoz, having lost 650 men and causing 400 French casualties. On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew most of his men from Badajoz, leaving behind a 7,000-strong garrison. The field army's 9,000 infantry settled on the heights of San Cristóbal while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the Caya. The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington's plan, failing to dig entrenchments on the heights, nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements. Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army for the next few days, concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz. Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers, rendering them impassable, so that between 11–18 February the French were only able to shell the southern end of the Spanish line, pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.; .  Battle  Map of the Battle of the Gebora, 19 February 1811 By the afternoon of 18 February, the rains had abated and lower water levels made the Gebora River fordable again. That evening Soult sent nine infantry battalions, three cavalry squadrons and two artillery batteries, under Mortier's command, to the north bank across a flying bridge over the Guadiana River. Joined by six cavalry regiments under Latour-Maubourg, the French now had 4,500 infantrymen, 2,500 cavalry and 12 cannon ready to attack the Spanish lines at dawn on 19 February. Due to heavy fog that morning, Mendizabal was unaware of the approaching French until his picket, only a mile from his front, was driven back by Mortier's infantry fording the Gebora. At the same time the 2nd Hussars, sent by Latour-Maubourg to turn the Spanish left flank, had managed to climb the heights to the north, also undetected, and fell upon one of de España's unsuspecting regiments. Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise Mortier demonstrated his tactical prowess in the deployment of his small force: he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the Spanish left; three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the Spanish right wing; and his remaining six infantry battalions assaulted the Spanish front. As the fog rose, the French light cavalry under Briche gained the heights and fell upon the Spanish left flank, while Latour-Maubourg took three dragoon regiments to attack the combined Spanish and Portuguese cavalry on the plains of the Caya. Despite outnumbering the French, the Allied horse ignored orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior. They escaped unscathed, largely because Latour-Maubourg ignored them and instead launched his cavalry against the Spanish infantry line. The engagement of the Spanish right flank was not as immediately decisive. Because the fog had lifted, the Spaniards could see the numerical weakness of the opposing force and formed up with little sign of falling. The musketry duel between the two sides had scarcely begun, however, when the French cavalry appeared; the light horse approached along the top of the heights while Latour-Maubourg's dragoons advanced from the rear. In response, Mendizabal formed his troops into two huge divisional squares supported by artillery which, although initially successful in impeding the French cavalry, eventually became an easy target for the French infantry and artillery. As one Spanish infantryman recounted, \\"Their artillery played upon it in a most horrible fashion until it became first an oval and then an unformed mass that the cavalry were able to penetrate and take prisoner.\\" Briche's light cavalry thus broke through the two Spanish squares without great difficulty, and the battle was effectively over. A few of the Spanish regiments dispersed; many surrendered; and others joined together to fight their way to Badajoz or the Portuguese border.  Consequences  The battle was a serious setback for the Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese allies; Wellington had earlier warned the Spanish generals that the Army of Extremadura was \\"the last body of troops which their country possesses\\", and Wellington to La Romana . and later wrote that \\"[t]he defeat of Mendizabal is the greatest misfortune, which was not previously expected, that has yet occurred to us.\\"Wellington to Henry Wellesley . The army had been essentially destroyed; although 2,500 infantry had escaped into Badajoz—and a slightly smaller number to Portugal—about 1,000 Spaniards had been killed or wounded, 4,000 were taken prisoner and 17 cannon had been lost.; . The French, for their part, suffered only minor casualties. Soult initially reported his losses as 30 killed and 140 wounded, but those figures were eventually revised to around 400 casualties, mainly from the cavalry. Soult was now free to continue his investment of Badajoz; although the town's garrison was now some 8,000 strong due to the influx of soldiers from Mendizabal's destroyed army, it eventually fell to the French on 11 March. Wellington then sent a large Anglo-Portuguese corps, commanded by Sir William Beresford, to retake the important fortress town, and by 20 April the second siege of Badajoz had begun. A French attempt to lift this siege resulted, on 16 May, in the bloody Battle of Albuera, in which Beresford's strong Allied corps maintained the siege but only barely managed to hold off an outnumbered French army, again commanded by Soult. However, when the French Army of Portugal, now under the command of Marshal Auguste Marmont, and the Army of the South converged, the combined French force of over 60,000 men forced Wellington, on 20 June, to call off the siege and pull his 44,000-man besieging army back to Elvas. Thus Badajoz would remain in French hands until the following year, when the Allies finally retook it following the Battle of Badajoz.

It was the backdrop of the 1930 painting American Gothic by Grant Wood, generally considered Wood's most famous work and among the most recognized paintings in twentieth century American art. Grant Wood, who observed the house only twice in his lifetime, made only an initial sketch of the house—he completed American Gothic at his studio in Cedar Rapids. First owned by Eldon resident Charles Dibble after its construction in 1881 and 1882, the home was (with one 1897 exception) a private residence until the late twentieth century. After a thirty-year preservation effort culminated with the donation of the house in 1991 to the State Historical Society of Iowa, the site now includes the original house in its 1930 form and a visitors center.

He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and- batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms.The interior of the home is described on a sign posted outside the house and qtd. in Biel, pp. 18–9. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States. This side view evinces the modest size of the house; it also obscures most of the home's addition to give a glimpse of the original design. There is no conclusive evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic windows on the upper level. The windows are believed to have been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time. The Dibbles' house was foreclosed around 1897 after they were unable to pay their taxes, and they are recorded as living in Portland, Oregon, in the 1900 Census.Indicated in the 1900 United States Census are a Charles A. and Catharine Dibble of Michigan Ave., Portland, Oregon. Subsequent census records seem to indicate that the Dibbles spent the remainder of their lives there. It changed hands several times until 1917, when Gideon and Mary Hart Jones purchased it. The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created the west wing of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home as a backdrop for American Gothic. American Gothic The house as depicted by Wood in American Gothic During the summer of 1930, Edward Rowan, a young gallery director from Cedar Rapids, a large city approximately to the northeast of Eldon, attempted to promote fine arts in the rural town by opening a gallery and library and leading art classes in Eldon. Rowan's attempts were met with success—the Eldon Forum called the exhibitions \\"an unusual treat.\\"Qtd. in Biel, p. 21 This, along with an indebtedness Wood felt toward Rowan, drew the painter (himself a native of Anamosa, Iowa) to come to Eldon.Qtd. in Hoving, p. 36 In August, Wood was driven around the town by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp, looking for inspiration. Sharp's brother suggested in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched the house on the back of an envelope. Wood did not immediately regard the house as beautiful, but he did find it captivating. His earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood \\"thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house.\\"Garwood, p. 119 At the time, Wood classified it as one of the \\"cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms\\" and considered it \\"very paintable.\\" After obtaining the permission of the Jones family, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on paperboard from the house's front yard. This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work; however, Wood did not add figures to the sketch until he returned to Cedar Rapids.Qtd. in Biel, p. 22 Although Wood never returned to Eldon, he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting. Later history and current status Decades after American Gothic was regarded as an American icon, the house continued to serve as a private residence, usually for rent, transferring ownership only once more from the Jones family to the Seldon Smith family at a \\"distress sale\\" in 1942. A grassroots movement to preserve the house was started as early as 1945 by Nan Wood, Grant Wood's sister and the female figure depicted in American Gothic. A visit in 1960 to the house (which was beginning to fall into disrepair) by Des Moines architect and historian William J. Wagner, A.I.A. capped these early efforts. He was among the first to suggest preservation of the house as a historic site: Center staff assist in dressing up visitors and taking their photograph outside the house. In the early 1970s, a series of letters between Eldon businessmen and Carl E. Smith—who has recently inherited the house—revealed differing opinions on its continued use: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house an historic site.Letter of November 7, 1970, from Robert Weidenbach to Seldon Smith; letters of November 22, 1971, and December 10, 1971, between Robert Weidenbach and Carl E. Smith. All three are on display at the American Gothic House Center. The house was abandoned for much of the 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well.Biel, p. 32 Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave. After the home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an application by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.American Gothic House Center statistics Visitors are encouraged to view the house from the outside and have their photo taken—in fact, the visitors center provides many sizes of similar aprons and jackets worn by the original painting's models. The adjacent American Gothic House Center, completed in 2007, contains exhibits about the painting, artist Grant Wood, and the community around the house. Each June, the city of Eldon holds its Gothic Days festival, a celebration of the painting and rural life in Eldon in the 1930s. Starting in 2015, tours began of the first floor of the home.

Bush on August 10, 2005. The commission was an attempt to study and develop a vision for the United States' surface transportation system. In laying out the parameters for the Commission, Section 1909 noted that “it is in the National interest to preserve and enhance the surface transportation system to meet the needs of the United States for the 21st century.” Section 1909 charged the commission with reviewing the condition and future needs of the surface transportation system; recommending future roles and programs; and identifying finance mechanisms for the surface transportation system in the immediate, short and long terms. It is expected that the group’s recommendations will serve as a prelude to the reauthorization of SAFETEA-LU in 2009. Commission Activities The Commission held an intensive consultation to learn about the issues facing the nation’s transportation system. A 77-member blue-ribbon panel of transportation experts was established, to provide the Commission with recommendations and additional insight. This panel included experts from different levels of government, the private sector, and research and academic institutions. The Commission held field hearings in ten cities: Dallas, Portland, Memphis, New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, and Chicago. During these hearings, 231 witnesses testified on a wide range of topics covering all forms of surface transportation. The hearings often included tours of facilities, or discussion of issues unique to those parts of the country. Several of these field hearings were co-sponsored by major transportation industry groups. The Commission met 12 times during the course of its operations, both in public and in executive session in Washington, D.C., and heard from 62 expert witnesses during these sessions. Individual Commissioners regularly participated in conferences and meetings to solicit input from key transportation stakeholders, and provided interviews and editorial columns to newspapers. The Commission also developed a public Web site that included testimony from the field hearings and public sessions, as well as key information about the Commission’s work. Final Report The Commission released its report on January 15, 2008, making the full text of Volumes 1 and 2 available on the commission's website. The report concluded that the current surface transportation program in the United States should not be reauthorized in its current form. Instead, the report recommended development of a new Federal policy focusing on the national interest, with the key elements of such a policy being: *A strong federal role in surface transportation, that would evolve to meet the national interest *Increased spending by all levels of government and the private sector to compensate for past investment failures while addressing significant increases in future demand *A commitment to make more effective use of taxpayers’ money in the national interest *Federal funding that is performance-based and focused on cost-beneficial outcomes with accountability for the full range of economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of investments *Far-reaching program reform to eliminate waste and delays in federally funded program delivery Members The Commission included 12 members appointed by the President and Congressional leaders: DOT Sec.

The park is named for Sir Alexander Bannerman, Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland from 1857 to 1864, who assented to an Act establishing the park and donated land for the purpose in 1864. In 1891 the city funded the design and development of the park as a formal Victorian Garden. Chad Bennett, The Overcast - Newfoundland's Alternative Newspaper, 27 July 2017. The park occupies the city block bounded by Bannerman Road, Military Road, Rennie's Mill Road, and Circular Road excluding several residential lots carved out of the southwest corner. History Bannerman Park was first established as a botanical garden on July 23rd, 1847, on the barrens between Government House and Rawlin's Cross. The barrens were previously unbuilt except for the Native Hall of the Native Society, the cornerstone of which was laid by Governor Harvey on May 24th, 1845, on a site adjacent the present bandstand. The hall and land were being used to house some of those displaced by the Great Fire of 1846 when the hall blew down on September 19th, 1846, killing a five- and twenty-year-old sheltering there. The Society's land was subsequently surrendered to the government. On April 13th, 1864, Governor Alexander Bannerman gave assent to an Act establishing Bannerman Park as a public park, the Dominion's first. The garden had been criticized as being too small for the establishment of a proper park, however Bannerman granted access to additional land, both public and private, on the south side of Circular Road. Due to financial constraints the park was unfunded at this time and sat undeveloped for several years. In the late 1860s the Victoria Rink, a skating rink, was erected on Military Road. A second rink, the Avalon Curling and Skating Rink, was opened on January 4, 1870, by Governor Hill. Of the Avalon rink approximately 4,200ft2 of ice was reserved for curlers and 8,200ft2 for skaters. The Victoria Link would later come to be known as Exhibition Hall. In June 1872 George E. Wilson opened a theatre in Victoria Rink known as Wilson's New Theatre. One rink was eventually converted by Charles Henry \\"Professor\\" Danielle for use as a costume rental. Both burned to the ground on July 17th, 1878. According to Paul O'Neill the first recorded use of the name Bannerman Park was in 1883 despite the fact that the park was still not formally opened at the time. In 1888 St. John's Municipal Council assumed responsibility for the park and committed $10,000 toward landscaping it and Victoria Park on Water Street West. On April 11th. 1891, Council opened a design competition for the laying-out of the park with submissions due on the 29th of the same month and a prize of $50. On May 9th, 1891, the winning design was announced to be that of local balladeer Johnny Burke. William Joseph Browne, son-in-law of then-councilmember John Harris wrote that the design was actually the work of carpenter William Harris, brother of John, who entered under the name of Burke, his neighbour and friend, to avoid the appearance of impropriety. The design, among other things, included plans for a lake or plot inscribed with the shape of the island of Newfoundland to be installed behind the Colonial Building. Bannerman Park was officially opened on September 1st, 1891. After the Great Fire of 1892 Bannerman Park was again used for housing displaced citizens and a tent city grew there. On July 3rd, 1928, local Rotarians opened a pool in the park including changing rooms and a wading pool for small children. On September 6, 1959, the Lions' Club opened a heated outdoor pool. Revitalization In 2010 the City of St. John's established the Bannerman Park Foundation to implement the Bannerman Park Master Plan. Thousands attended the \\"grand re-opening ... on June 21, 2015\\". The Park's history \\"was commemorated with major upgrades and improvements as part of a nearly $6 million capital program. Since developing a Park Master Plan in 2003, the Grand Concourse worked with the City of St. John's, the Bannerman Park Foundation, and many generous donors\\". Between 2012-2015 \\"new entranceways and water features were constructed\\", \\"Victorian-style amenities\\" installed, and planting and landscaping undertaken throughout the Park. \\"Upgrades included an outdoor skating loop, a new playground, upgrades to the pool area and a new [formal main] entrance\\".Grand Concourse Authority. Features Bannerman Park's current amenities include a baseball field, splash pad, outdoor swimming pool, skating loop, canteen and washroom structure, bandstand, and memory garden. The park is also home to a number of monuments, memorials, and public art installations: * A ten-foot granite monument and bust commemorates Roman Catholic priest Father Michael Morris, founder of the province's first orphanage at Villa Nova, Manuels, in 1880 and local magazine The Orphan's Friend. * The official plaque for Parks Canada's Shawnadithit National Historic Person designation. * A bronze statue by sculptor Morgan MacDonald entitled The Skater was donated by Elinor Gill Ratcliffe in 2016, marking the end of a five-year revitalization project. * A bronze statue entitled Homecoming, also by MacDonald, was dedicated to surviving members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in 2018. Events Bannerman Park plays host to many festivals and sporting events, most notably the Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival, founded in 1977 as the Bannerman Park Folk Festival. In 1978 British balloonists Donald Cameron and Christopher Davey embarked from the park on the eighteenth known attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean by balloon. Other notable events include Peace-A-Chord, a free one- and two-day music festival held in the park from 1985 to 2003 and 2005 to 2006. It is the finishing location for the Tely 10 road race. Bannerman Park is the setting for The Bannerman Quartet, an award-winning, place-based audio fiction developed by Chris Brookes of Battery Radio in 2015. The smartphone app features four stories written by Megan Gail Coles, Joel Thomas Hynes, Sara Tilley, and Michael Winter, performed by Hynes, Allan Hawco, Petrina Bromley, and Lois Brown, and scored by Jake Nicoll. In 2016 it won a Prix Marulic for Special Achievement in Radiophony for Use of New Media. In 2019 the park was the setting for Other Women Walk, a historical walking tour created by Ruth Lawrence recounting tales of the local suffrage movement. Actors Wendi Smallwood, Monica Walsh, and Marie Jones delivered monologues while playing fictionalized versions of period figures including a housekeeper and sex worker.

First discovered by Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral on April 22, 1500, it remained a Portuguese colony until it declared its independence on September 7, 1822. Brazilian nationality prior to independence Brazil's economy was largely based on agriculture and mining; specifically the production of sugar and tobacco for export. As a result, land was concentrated in the hands of relatively few wealthy, plantation-owning families, and production was largely dependent on slave labor. The intermixing of these Europeans and Blacks, as well as the native Indians of the territory, helped create a unique people and culture.Burns,6 The social, economic, and political hierarchy of this period was largely based on race; with Europeans occupying the upper ranks and the non-whites subsequent ranks below them. Despite these internal divisions, Brazil possessed a number of factors that aided in the formation of nationalist sentiments among the elite. \\"[...]First its unity of territory. Brazil stretches unbroken from the Amazon in the north to the Rio de la Plata in the south, and from the Atlantic coast to the foothills of the Andes[...] The vast majority of the people speak Portuguese and are Roman Catholic. Their language differentiates them from their Spanish speaking neighbors[...]\\" Burns, 5 A growing nationalistic trend in literature,Burns, 9 and the emergence of colonial born elites created a sense of pride and attachment to the territory of Brazil and a distancing from Portugal. The revolutions in America, France, and the Spanish America along with the maturation of Brazil as a colony furthered nationalist sentiments.Burns, 25 =Role of the Napoleonic Wars in Brazilian independence= Despite its natural geographic barriers and the distinct culture of its inhabitants, Brazilian independence would only be realized after a series of events set in motion by the Napoleonic Wars. In 1807, Portugal was invaded by Napoleon forcing prince regent Dom Joao to flee to Brazil along with other members of the royal family, and a number of notables and functionaries. This effectively making Brazil the seat of the Portuguese government.Britannica, 80 While in Brazil, Dom Joao instituted a number of reforms and decrees, most notably the one on December 16, 1815, which designated the Portuguese dominions the \\"United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves\\", making Brazil coequal with Portugal. After the French withdrawal from Portugal, mounting pressure from the Cortes (Portuguese parliament) forced the return of Dom Joao (now King John VI) in 1821. He appointed his son, Dom Pedro, regent in his place. Looking to return Brazil to its formerly dependent colonial status, the Cortes repealed many of the decrees and reforms of King John VI, and demanded Dom Pedro's return to Europe. Defying the Cortes, Dom Pedro formed a legislative and constituent assembly on June 3, 1822, and declared Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822. He was crowned Brazil's first emperor on December 1. =Recognition of Brazil as a nation= *The United States recognized Brazil as a new nation in 1824. Portugal followed a year later. *In 1827, a treaty between Brazil and Britain was signed. By signing the treaty Brazil agreed to abolish the slave trade within three years, and grant Britain a favored position in its markets in return for Britain's recognition of its independence.Burns, 35 Evolutions =Government= Since its independence Brazil has been subject to a lot of internal unrest resulting in several years of military rule and the promulgation of several different constitutions, the most recent one being passed in 1988. While political change has been frequent, the social and economic realities in Brazil have remained largely the same. \\"Throughout modern Brazilian history every change of political regime-from the establishment of an independent empire in the early 1820s to the establishment of a modern representative democracy in the late 1980s- has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of the Brazilian elites to defend the status quo and their own interests by controlling, co-opting and, if necessary, repressing the forces in favor of radical social change[...]\\",Bethell While political and military developments in Europe helped lead to Brazilian independence, it was also partially a result of the Brazilian elites. The plantation owners backed Pedro's declaration of independence because it granted them greater freedom to conduct trade and the opportunity to expand their overseas markets. The emerging urban elite saw, who occupied an insecure position between plantation owners and slaves saw it as a way to improve their status.Burns, 30 Once agreed upon, independence was secured quickly and peacefully, with no concessions being made to the underprivileged groups in society. \\"The transition from colony to independent empire was characterized by political, economic, and social continuity.\\" Leslie Bethell Subsequent governments and constitutions were also largely the result of elite initiatives. =Political incorporation and suffrage= Imperial Constitution Under the Imperial Constitution, power was concentrated in the hands of the hereditary emperor who had the power to appoint ministers, counselers of state, provincial presidents, and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies was elected by a small segment of the population. Though the government was only responsible to it in a limited extent. Despite this, political participation of this period was surprisingly high. Men who were twenty-five years old (twenty-one if married), Catholic, born free, with quite low annual income had the right to vote in the elections of the Chamber of Deputies. These elections were however indirect. They elected eleitores, who were required to have a higher annual income, further restricting electoral participation. And only the eleitores had the right to vote on the deputies. The initial rates of high political participation were eventually restricted in the latter parts of the nineteenth century. A gradual shift from slave to free labor, made abolition seem inevitable. This created a growing fear among both rural and urban elites that emancipated slaves would acquire the property necessary to secure the right to vote. To quell this fear, the Savaria Law was passed in 1881. Under this law the Chamber of Deputies would be directly elected, the voting age was lowered to twenty-one, and the property/income qualification to vote was removed. It also allowed non-Catholics and former slaves to become eligible voters. Most importantly, it required people to pass a literacy test in order to gain the right to vote. Rather than extend political participation, the literacy tests greatly restricted it because eighty to eighty-five percent of the population at this time was illiterate. Therefore, this literacy requirement counteracted the other democratic advances of the Savaria Law. =Abolition of slavery= The Constitution of the Empire and subsequent laws all failed to deem slaves as citizens. Instead, slaves were still \\"excluded from the political community, from exercise of any political right, from all participation in national sovereignty of public authority.\\" Chalhoub, 76 However, the Constitution did allow libertos(freed slaves) to vote in elections, provided that they met the property income requirements. Despite its promise to Britain to abolish the slave trade within three years of its 1827 treaty, Brazil continued to import slaves up until the 1850s.Skidmore, 13 It was only after economic and political conditions permitted, that government initiatives were undertaken to abolish the slavery November 1866: immersed in the Paraguayan War and anxious to recruit troops, an Imperial Government decree permits slaves to serve in the Brazilian army, and in return would be granted their freedom unconditionally.Skidmore, 15 In 1871, the Law of the Free Womb was passed, which declared that all children subsequently born to slave mothers would be free. A loop hole allowed the master to refuse the government indemnity payment offered for the child at age 8, and thus, retain the child until 21.Chalhoub, 81 The children of slaves who were freed at the age of eight were turned over to the Imperial government and entitled to learn how to read and write in government institutions or through private tutors. However, the masters who opted to retain the children had no obligation to educate them. This had the effect of excluding them from formal political participation, after their freedom, because of their illiteracy.Chalhoub, 82 In 1885, the Sexagenarian Law was passed. This unconditionally freed slaves over sixty.Skidmore, 38 On May 13, 1888, Princess Isabel, acting in place of her ailing father Pedro II, signed the law that abolished slavery in Brazil, granting no compensation to slave owners. This freed 700,000 slaves. Republican constitution The entire executive branch (president, state governor, and municipal prefeito) as well as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, state assemblies and municipal councils were all elected. However, fraud, intimidation, violence and the exercise of patronage by local landowners and agents of the grown was widespread. The presidential elections of this period were predetermined by state governors, and state elections were dominated by the Republican parties. Despite this, and the limitations remaining of suffrage, the early years of the Republic did allow for a substantial advance in direct popular participation in comparison with the late empire. From Vargas to the military coup The revolution of 1930 effectively ended the Old Republic, and brought Getúlio Vargas to power. He undertook a policy which sought to increase political incorporation within Brazil. Rather than focus on extending political and economic rights, Vargas focused on the expansion of social rights in an attempt to control the process of economic growth and modernization.Reis A 1931 electoral law lowered the voting age to eighteen and granted woman the right to vote, making Brazil the second country in Americas to do so. By 1933, the first woman had been elected to the Constituent Assembly. The 1934 Social Charter in the Constitution guaranteed social rights to certain occupations, while neglecting rural labor and certain urban occupations. This resulted in a hierarchy of citizenship categories based on occupational prestige, defined along the lines of unequal welfare benefits.Mitchell and Wood The social rights guaranteed in this charter were closely tied to the urban labor market. In order to be entitled to health assistance, retirement funds and other welfare benefits it required one to be entered in a formal job contract. This form of regulated citizenship emerged from the government's need to control the process of economic growth and modernization. By granting these social rights the government increasingly drew people into the urban labor market, allowing for economic expansion and development. As a result, the state, under Vargas took the lead in promoting nation-building and industrial growth in Brazil. After a 1945 electoral law was passed, men and women who were formally employed were automatically registered to vote. This was an attempt to expand political participation among the urban working class, while still largely neglected the rural population. The same year voting is also made mandatory. The Constitution of 1946 still restricted political participation on the basis of literacy, disenfranchising more than half of the population as a result. An act of Congress in 1950 restored individual responsibility over voter registration. This restricted the political participation of urban workers, who had previously been automatically registered as a result of their employment. Military coup of 1964 One of the key factors responsible for this military coup was the political mobilization of the rural lower classes. This threatened to undermine a tenet central to the government led modernization, the exclusion of the lower rural classes from citizenship. As a result, the military took power, inaugurating twenty-one years of military dictatorship, which would be marked by further involvement of the state in economic development and political repression. To extend political incorporation the regime tried to generalize access to social rights, first by unifying the welfare system, and also by partially extending social rights to rural laborers. The continuous growth of the labor market helped incorporate people into the citizenship model based on social rights. This increasing concentration of populations in urban centers created a strong demand on public goods and services, which was only exacerbated with the economic crisis of the 1980s. Further adding to the situation, the growth of urban employment in the informal economy not only restricted access of social rights to this segment of the population, but weakened the tax basis for the welfare state. Under these circumstances, the minority with secured jobs and access to social rights essentially became a privileged segment of the population. This only increased the political, social, and economic inequality that characterized Brazil. Democracy 1985 saw the return of civilian rule following the election of president José Sarney. Following his elections he passed a series of constitutional amendments which extended suffrage; most notably by removing the literacy requirement that restricted votership. The municipal elections of 1985 were the first elections in Brazil based on universal suffrage. The following years the elections of Congress and state governors were also based on universal suffrage. These developments represented an important step towards the institutionalization of democracy in Brazil. =Constitution of 1988= The promulgation of a new constitution in 1988, marked the formal shift from a military dictatorship to a democracy in Brazil.Wheeler It was followed in 1989 by the first direct presidential elections in thirty years, and the first presidential elections to be based upon universal suffrage. It lifted official barriers to political participation and formally protected political rights. Like the constitutions before it, it denies status privileges and reaffirms the inviolability of private property and equality of all citizens before the law. It also strengthened the Afonso Arinos Law. Originally passed in 1951, it sought to punish racial discrimination by redefining racist practice as a crime rather than just a misdemeanor. Under the new constitution it went further, denying bail to those convicted of racial or colour prejudice, and stipulating prison sentences. The constitution also restricted the power of the military, bolstered individual rights, and implemented means to protect marginalized groups. Racial inequality in Brazil Poverty and inequality are persistent in Brazil, largely as a result the legacy of Portuguese colonialism and its dependence on slave labor. The social, economic and political development of Brazil only tended to increase inequality, primarily among the non-white population. \\"[It is] clear that the darker a Brazilian, the more likely he [is] to be found at the bottom of the socio-economic scale by every indicator- income, occupation, education [...] subtle but unmistakable discrimination in social relations remain[...] although it has never been codified since the colonial era.\\"Skidmore Despite the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in Brazil, there remains a discrepancy between formal principles of the state the actualities of democracy in practice.inequalities The effects of skin color exemplify this fact, often perpetuating the inequalities that universal citizenship claimed to remove. Within Brazil, a large proportion of the population still lack basic citizenship rights, such as access to education. As a result, new forms of citizenship are developing independent of state control, like the situation in the favelas. There is a growing social, political, economic and spatial exclusion of people living in informal urban settlements like favelas.Wheeler, 36 As the state withdraws from providing social services from these areas, family and social networks step in and fill the gap. This caused a growing informalization of political activity among these groups, whereby these citizens identify their participation in the local community as the core feature of citizenship. They have moved them away from the national discourse of rights-based democratic practices as their definition of citizenship, towards one expressed through specific forms of community participation.Wheeler, 37 =Indians= Since the time of European colonization, Indians have been marginalized spatially, politically, and economically. During the colonial period, the policy towards Indians was to exterminate them or to contain them in church settlements.Allen, 149 From the establishment of the republic on, the state has actively pursued a policy aimed at assimilating these native groups, and integrating them into Brazilian society.Allen, 151 See also *History of Brazil References =Footnotes= =Notations= *Allen, Elizabeth. \\"Brazil: Indians and the new Constitution\\".

The plural is aesymnetai. The title originally signified merely a judge in the heroic games, but afterwards indicated an individual who was occasionally invested voluntarily by his fellow citizens with essentially unlimited power in a Greek state. Aristotle called the office an \\"elective tyranny\\", and said that the power of the aesymnetai partook in some degree of the nature \\"both of kingly and tyrannical authority; since he was appointed legally and ruled over willing subjects, but at the same time was not bound by any laws in his public administration.\\"Aristotle, Politics iii. 9. § 5, iv. 8. § 2Hesych. s. v. Hence Theophrastus calls the office (\\"elective tyranny\\"), and Dionysius compares it with the dictatorship at Rome.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, v. 73 It was not hereditary; but it was sometimes held for life, and at other times only until some object was accomplished, such as the reconciling of the various factions in the state. There is only one recorded instant of a person expressly receiving the title of Aesymnetes: Pittacus, in Mytilene, who was appointed to this dignity because the state had been long torn asunder by the various factions, and who succeeded in restoring peace and order by his wise regulations and laws.Strabo, xiii. p. 617Plutarch, Solon 4Diogenes Laërtius, i. 75Plehn, Lesbiaca, pp. 4 6,48 There were, however, no doubt many other persons who ruled under this title for a while in the various states of Greece, and those law-givers bore a strong resemblance to the aesymnetai, whom their fellow citizens appointed with supreme power to enact laws, as Dracon, Solon, Zaleucus and Charondas. In some states, such as Cyme and Chalcedon, it was the title borne by the regular magistrates. According to Aristotle, the office fell into disuse due to the risk of those who would not willingly relinquish the office, and the Greek States allowed it to disappear altogether.Aristotle, Politics 1285a, 31 See also * Elective dictatorship - a similar concept in parliamentary government References : Category:Forms of government Category:Ancient Greek titles ","title":"Aesymnetes"},{"id":"14005514","text":"Jonathan Edward Caldwell (born March 24, 1883, date of death unknown) was a self-taught aeronautical engineer who designed a series of bizarre aircraft and started public companies in order to finance their construction. None of these was ever successful, and after his last known attempt in the later 1930s he disappeared, apparently to avoid securities fraud charges. His name was later connected with mythical German flying saucers, and he remains a fixture of the UFO genre to this day. Little of Caldwell's early life is known, and what has been documented was reconstructed from college records. He appears to have been born in Hensall, Ontario, Canada, the fifth son (and one of twelve children) of William Thomas Caldwell (1848-1930) and Sarah Alice Chamberlain (1852-1933). He emigrated to the United States in 1910, and attended Oregon State College, from 1912 to 1913, majoring in mechanical engineering. In the 1920s, according to statements he made later in life, he became interested in aviation and began to study the fundamentals of aerodynamics.The Fantastically Flighty Gray Goose Cyclogyro Diagram of the cyclogyro design from the company stationery. The image is inaccurate: the airfoils had a limited degree of rotation, and would face \\"down\\" on the front portion of the disk, whereas this image shows them facing forward. In February 1923 Caldwell filed for a patent on a device he called the \\"cyclogyro\\". It consisted of an airplane fuselage with two paddle-wheel like attachments in place of the wings. The wheels were powered by an engine in the fuselage, spun to power the upper portion of the attachments forward - clockwise, as seen looking left from the cockpit. The wheels each featured four high aspect ratio airfoils, which were able to rotate around their horizontal axis in order to change their pitch. By changing the pitch continually through the entire rotation, the lift of the airfoils could be tuned to produce thrust in any direction. For instance, to lift off vertically the airfoils were pitched to have a positive angle of attack only at the top of their rotation, just generating lift only at that point. In forward flight the angle at the top of the arc would be reduced to make the lift neutral, but they would retain their positive angle even through the forward part of the circle, producing forward thrust. By changing the angle in this fashion, the aircraft could be \\"lifted\\" in any direction, with differential thrust between the two \\"wings\\" allowing yaw to be applied. Caldwell formed Gravity Aeroplane Company in Reno, Nevada (Caldwell was living in Santa Monica at the time) and issued stock in 1928. Their company stationary included an illustration showing the cyclogyro, a version with four airfoils per \\"wing\\", attached on the fuselage end to a large disk and the outer end to a cross-like support. Ornithopter Diagram of the ornithopter design from the patent application. The wedge-shaped objects on the wings (#20) consist of the fabric \\"valves\\" (#21), which would blow closed against the supports (#20) on the downstroke. Caldwell then turned to an even more bizarre aircraft design, an ornithopter. The wings were equipped with flexible fabric valves which were supposed to open on the upstroke and close on the downstroke, allowing it to generate lift with no forward motion and thus provide VTOL service, like the cyclogyro. Caldwell, now living in Denver filed a patent on his new design in December 1927, which was finally granted as US1730758 in October 1929. In early 1928 he started another company in Nevada to raise funds to develop it, 'Gray Goose Airways', inc., issuing 10,000 shares of stock at ten cents per share, retaining a 51 percent interest. The funds were used to develop a human-powered prototype. By 1931 there was still no working prototype, and Caldwell moved to Orangeburg, New York, and later to Madison, New Jersey.The Fantastically Flighty Gray Goose, Aerofiles.com. Accessed March 11, 2011. \\"By 1931 Caldwell had failed to produce a viable ornithopter in Nevada and Colorado and moved his enterprise to the east coast, evidently first to Orangeburg NY and, later, to Madison NJ.\\" A January 14, 1932 newsreel film shows the ornithopter being readied for a test. This was apparently attempted without success, by the otherwise unknown Emile Harrier. Additional funds were then raised by another stock issue in order to build a full-sized prototype at Teterboro Airport. He also apparently restarted his cyclogyro work, and an article appeared in one of the Popular Mechanics-like magazines showing the design equipped with a V-8 engine mounted in an odd twin-fuselage with the pilot and passengers below. Before the ornithopter prototype could be completed, the New Jersey Assistant Attorney General charged Caldwell with fraud in September. In his notes, the Attorney, Robert Grossman, noted that \\"no one connected with the company possessed sufficient knowledge of aeronautics to build a practical ship.\\" Caldwell eventually reached an agreement that allowed him to continue construction of the ornithopter prototype until December, as long as no more shares of stock were sold in that time. Grossman also noted that Caldwell had begun work on yet another entirely new design, using a disk wing. In December there was still no prototype, and Caldwell moved the company to New York. The New York Attorney General started questioning the business almost immediately. Autogyro In 1934 Caldwell moved again, this time to Washington, DC. In a filing with the Maryland Securities and Exchange Commission he described the company as working solely on a new type of autogyro, which he referred to as a \\"disk- rotor plane\\". The design consisted of a fairly conventional autogyro layout, but the wing was disk-like instead of the more traditional helicopter-like bladed assembly. The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric on the inside of the rim, and four small solid surfaces on the outside. In forward motion the airstream blowing across the four small surfaces would spin the disk, which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils inside. On reaching cruising altitude, the disk would be braked to stop it spinning, and unbraked again for a near-vertical landing. The advantage to this arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed, whereas a conventional autogyro cannot be stopped in flight, and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approaches the stall speed. Unlike his previous attempts, the disk-rotor aircraft was actually completed between 1936 and 1938, and was issued a CAA experimental registration number NX99Y. In late 1937 or early 1938 a test flight was attempted with the company mechanic at the controls, Willard Driggers. According to later claims (see below), Driggers managed to get the aircraft airborne from the Benning Race Track, and in a panic cut power, causing the aircraft to crash-land, damaging the landing gear. Although damage was minor, Caldwell had apparently already lost interest in the design and did not repair it. Another autogyro In 1939 Caldwell shut down Grey Goose and swapped shares once again, forming Rotor Planes, Inc. His latest design retained the disk-rotor from his earlier autogyro, but replaced the fuselage with a smaller disk in the center. According to some accounts, around 1940 the Maryland securities commission also started examining Caldwell, who promptly disappeared, abandoning the broken disk-rotor and the partially completed rotorplane. The USAF investigates In May 1949, officers of the U.S. Air Force's Project Sign received a letter from a Gray Goose shareholder, who explained that the company had been building aircraft similar to the \\"flying saucers\\" which were then a popular topic in the press. This was during the UFO craze following Kenneth Arnold's reports of seeing UFOs over Mount Rainier and the Roswell Incident that followed. The Air Force had canvassed for reports of flying saucers, and the shareholder apparently felt that Caldwell's disk-rotor might explain them. Tracking down the leads, the team, accompanied by the Maryland Police, visited an abandoned farm in Glen Burnie, Maryland (outside Baltimore), where the damaged remains of Caldwell's disk-rotor aircraft were discovered. They also tracked down Driggers, who told them the story of the attempted flight in 1937/8. The team reported that the prototypes could not be responsible for the \\"flying saucer\\" reports that were being received from all around the country.Just old contraptions, \\"Flying Saucers\\" find proves false alarm, The Los Angeles Times, August 21, 1949 Photographs of the broken disk- rotor machine continue to appear in UFOs books to this day. They were often described as \\"crashed\\" flying saucers in earlier works, claiming it was one more example of the USAF being in possession of such vehicles. More recently they are normally connected with the claims that the Nazis had built working flying saucers late in the war, lumped together with other disk-shaped aircraft like the Avrocar, Arthur Sack A.S.6 and Vought V-173, in an effort to demonstrate that such aircraft were both possible and well-researched. Personal life In 1909/10, Caldwell married Olive E Davis. Caldwell emigrated to the United States in 1910. In 1930, Caldwell was living in Denver with his wife, Olive E Caldwell (48, born Wisconsin) and son Carl Davis Caldwell (July 17, 1917, Montana - November 27, 1993, Cupertino, California).

He was on Mississippi's death row with 64 others but was issued a stay of execution in October 2007 by the U.S. Supreme Court. He was ultimately executed on May 21, 2008.  Early life  Based on court testimony, Berry was a disturbed suicidal young man who reportedly attempted to swallow a razor blade at one time, and who had spent time in mental institutions for paranoid schizophrenia. His IQ was estimated to be well below average.  Criminal record  Berry's convictions between 1979 and 1981 included simple assault on a law enforcement officer, grand larceny, perjury, burglary and escape.  Murder, kidnapping, prosecution, convictions, death sentence, lack of remorse  Berry was convicted and sentenced to death by a Chickasaw County jury for the November 29, 1987 murder of Mary Bounds. The victim was kidnapped and beaten to death after leaving her weekly church choir practice, and her body was found just off a Chickasaw County road near Houston, Mississippi. Berry admitted to the killing, and the confession was used against him at trial. He had admitted that he intended to commit rape but had changed his mind. He also changed his mind after telling her she would be freed and drove her to a second wooded location and used his fists to beat her to death. The victim died as a result of repeated blows to the head. Berry used his grandmother’s car and later drove to her house, disposed of a pair of mismatched tennis shoes along the way, burned his bloodied clothes, and wiped the vehicle he had used of any blood stains with a towel, which he threw into a nearby pond. Berry’s brother, who was at the house, witnessed some of this suspicious behavior. On December 5, 1987, he called investigators and told them what he had observed. The next day, Berry was arrested at his grandmother’s home and soon confessed to the crime. Police found the tennis shoes that Berry had discarded and also recovered the bloodied towel from the pond. Berry was indicted for the murder and kidnapping of Mary Bounds, and as a habitual criminal on March 1, 1988. Berry had stated in 2007 that he has no remorse for the crime.Supreme Court halts execution of Miss. man  clarionledger.com  The Clarion-Ledger He was subsequently scheduled to die by lethal injection on October 30, 2007 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman.  Stay of execution Though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied Berry's request to stop his execution (citing exceeded time limits to challenge the constitutionality of lethal injection), the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stay of execution minutes prior to Berry's scheduled execution at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. This effectively delayed but did not commute Berry's sentence. The order to delay execution was due to a pending Kentucky case before the court regarding the constitutionality of lethal injection. Dissenting justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Antonin Scalia noted that they would have denied the application to put off the execution which was scheduled for 6 pm. The Court's delay order came about 15 minutes before Berry was to be put to death by lethal injection.Prisoner temporarily spared death penalty by court - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)06-70051.0.wpd Execution The U.S. Supreme Court denied both Berry's appeals of his execution on May 21, 2008.

He elected not to take his last shower and did not make any phone calls. However, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two friends visited him on the day of his execution.

Moccasin with fringe. Fringe is an ornamental textile trim applied to an edge of a textile item, such as drapery, a flag, or epaulettes. Fringe originated as a way of preventing a cut piece of fabric from unraveling when a hemming was not used. Several strands of weft threads would be removed, and the remaining warp threads would be twisted or braided together to prevent unraveling. In modern fabrics, fringe is more commonly made separately and sewn on. Modern \\"add-on\\" fringe may consist of wool, silk, linen, or narrow strips of leather. The use of fringe is ancient, and early fringes were generally made of unspun wool (rather than spun or twisted threads). There are many types of fringe. Particularly in Western Europe, as wealth and luxury items proliferated during the Renaissance, types of fringe began to assume commonly accepted names. Styles of fringes were clearly defined in England by at least 1688. Type of fringe include: *Bullion fringe, twisted yarn which generally contains threads of silver or gold. The name derives from bullion hose, which had a twisted element at the top that resembled this type of fringe. Modern bullion fringe varies widely in texture and width, but generally is only in length. *Campaign fringe, from the French word campane (meaning \\"bell\\"), consists of small, bell-like tassels on the end. *Thread fringe, untwisted and unbraided loose warp threads.

It is presented by Matt Allwright and voiced over by Jeni Barnett, each episode features four chefs. It was first broadcast on BBC Two between 29 October and 7 December 2007. Format The show involves chefs being dealt two food cards and can use up to three ingredients from five more 'shared ingredient' cards. The chefs then decide in secret what dish they will prepare and then choose either to 'pitch' their idea or 'fold', if they don't believe they can cook anything with the available ingredients. Those who pitch their ideas must do so to the Food Poker Panel, which consists of seven food experts. The panel then vote, using poker chips, for the two dishes they wish to see prepared. There are three rounds, the savoury cook-off, the sweet cook-off and the final showcase cook-off. Once two chefs have been selected by the panel they have 20 minutes to cook their dishes, however they only have 15 minutes during the Sweet Cook-off. This time is very intense and competitive banter between chefs is commonplace. Once the chefs have cooked their dishes they are presented to the seven gourmets who then vote again for their preferred dish (no poker chips are used for this vote). Only the savoury and sweet cook-offs use this format. The showcase cook-off, which automatically features the two winners from the previous two cook-offs, has a different format. The Showcase Cook-off In this round the finalists are presented with a single card, which all can see: this ingredient must be the central feature of their dishes. They then have a choice from an array of other ingredient cards from a large selection; once a card has been selected it is not available to the other chef. Therefore chefs can both take the ingredients they need and/or steal ingredients which they think will be most valuable to their opponents. They then have 20 minutes to prepare their dishes. The two cooked dishes are then presented to the two losing chefs who then vote for their favourite and ultimately the winner, in the event of a tie the winner is decided by presenter, Matt Allwright.

Hallesby grew up as the sixth of eight siblings on a family farm with a father also served as an assistant pastor. His family was from the Lutheran piety of the Haugean heritage. He graduated with a degree in theology in 1903 and was awarded his doctorate in 1909.Steinar Moe: Ole Kristian Hallesby, Teolog (Norsk biografisk leksikon) Ole Kristian Hallesby taught at the Free Faculty of Theology from 1909 to 1952. He was chairman of the Norwegian Santal Mission 1902-1906 and chairman of the Norwegian Lutheran Inner Mission Society (Det norske lutherske Indremisjonsselskap) from 1923 to 1956. He was also central to the founding of Norwegian Christian Student and School Association in 1924.Ole Hallesby (Store norske leksikon)Det norske lutherske Indremisjonsselskap (Store norske leksikon) Nazi occupation of Norway An outspoken opponent of the Nazi occupation of Norway, he was arrested and detained at Grini concentration camp for two years (until the end of the war). During a razzia in November 1948 it was revealed that the already-imprisoned Nazi agents, Gard Holtskog, Sten Blom Westberg and Hans Johann Krijom, were about to fabricate a document which probably was supposed to tie Hallesby to the Nazis. Hell debate In 1953, a radio speech by Hallesby caused a major debate in Norway on the existence of hell. In the speech, Hallesby spoke to the non-religious that if you fell dead to the floor this moment, you fall at the same time into hell, and how can you who is unconverted lie down calmly to sleep at night, you who don't know if you'll wake up in your bed or in hell?Århundrets Hvem Hva Hvor, published 1999 by Schibsted The speech was condemned on the front page of Dagbladet the following day, and criticisms were raised against NRK for hosting Hallesby's speech. NRK responded that since there was a state church, they had to accept it as it was. Within the church, the debate ignited a conflict between liberal and literal interpretations of the Bible. The bishop of Hamar Kristian Schjelderup was the main spokesperson for the liberal side who argued that the damnation of hell was incompatible with a religion of love. Most of the church supported Hallesby's view of hell, though some did not support the wording in his speech. The debate also brought up questions whether there ought to be a state church. The debate may also have catalyzed the formation of the Norwegian Humanist Association.

The shirts and trousers are camouflaged in MARPAT, while the remainder are colored in either sand or olive drab. * The balaclava has a hinged face guard that lets the wearer pull down the face guard and expose his or her face without taking off a helmet to remove the whole balaclava. * The long-sleeve shirt has a mock neck, moisture-wicking, and antimicrobial properties. * The t-shirt has most of the same properties as the long-sleeve shirt. * The combat shirt closely resembles the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, but the portion covered by the Marine's body armor (such as the Outer Tactical Vest or Modular Tactical Vest) is not as highly reinforced due to the protective qualities of the vest, and to prevent discomfort. There are pockets only on the upper sleeve. * The combat trousers also closely resemble the utility uniform, but there is an additional calf-pocket to help distinguish it from non-FROG trousers. * The gloves are designed to be highly durable. * Fire-resistant versions of cold-weather clothing are produced and issued as FROG equipment, including: ** silkweight undershirts and underdrawers (nicknamed \\"polypro\\"), designed by Polartec as a mock turtleneck meant to be worn next to skinUnderwear, Next-to-skin, Cold Weather Flame Resistant (FR) Silkweight Underwear, Next-to-skin, Cold Weather ** The Grid Fleece Midweight underwear includes a pullover and pants (in green and coyote brown).Grid Fleece Flame Resistant (FR), Grid Fleece Underwear, Mid-Weight, Cold Weather ** The Inclement Weather Combat Shirt is used for protection from rain and snow, since the All Purpose Environmental Clothing System (APECS) is not fire- resistant. Flight and vehicle crewman suits are also re-classified as FROG II uniforms. The unit commander can dictate how much protection is needed by ordering one of two different FROG levels, which alter how much protective clothing is necessary. The Corps is acquiring a new cold-weather flame- resistant shirt, specifically for the bitter cold winters of Afghanistan, along with a new fire-resistant glove for increased insulation in cold-weather environments. History The FROG program was developed in 2006, and fielding to units began in 2007. In 2009, the shift of focus from Iraq to Afghanistan led to the development of cold-weather clothing. In May 2010, the Marine Corps Times featured an article addressing the base FROG's lack of durability, citing that the lack of regular laundering in Afghanistan leads to clothing failure within weeks, instead of the designed year. When exposed to water or sweat and improperly dried, the fabric would become brittle and seams would fail significantly with little stress. Marine officials have begun issuing additional suits as an interim response until the issue can be addressed.

Early life Vishnu Ganesh Pingle was born in 1888 to a Marathi Brahmin family Talegaon Dhamdhere, near Poona District, in the Bombay Presidency. The youngest of nine siblings, Pingle grew up in a loving family and at the age of nine was admitted to the primary school in Talegaon Dabhade. In 1905, Pingle enrolled at the Maharashtra Vidyalaya in Poona which at the time was linked to the Bombay University. While at school, Pingle came under the influence of the nationalist movement of the time, and actively participated in the movement under V. D. Savarkar. However, Pingle later transferred to the Samarth Vidyalaya in Talegoan Dabhade in 1908 following the closure of Maharashtra Vidyalay due to shortage of funds. However, his early involvement in the nationalist movement left a lasting imprint. In 1910, Samartha Vidyalaya was closed by the British Government. Vishnu left for Mumbai and found employment in Govindrao Potdar's Pioneer Alkali works at Mahim. Mr. Potdar was a nationalist and an expert at explosives. He belonged to the Nationalist Group and introduced Vishnu to his associates. One of them was Hari Laxman Patil, a lawyer from Vasai, with whom Vishnu came to form a close friendship. At the height of the Swadeshi Movement, inspired by the Japanese handloom industry, Pingle began his own small Swadeshi loom at Ausa, near Latur. However, Pingle's ambition was to be an engineer. United States Vishnu was also strongly influenced by the history of the American War of Independence. In 1911, Pingle left Ausa for the United States. It is said that he kept the news of his impending departure from his family and only told his elder brother Keshavrao of his plans at the railway station. He reached America via Hong Kong, and enrolled as a student of mechanical engineering at the University of Washington in 1912. While in the United States, Pingle became associated with the Ghadar Party and became an active worker. As World War I opened in Europe, plans began between the Germans, the Berlin Committee in Europe and the Ghadarite movement in America to attempt an insurrection in India. Ghadar Conspiracy Pingle had known Satyen Bhushan Sen (Jatin Mukherjee's emissary) in the company of Gadhar members (such as Kartar Singh Sarabha) at the University of California, Berkeley. Tasked to consolidate contact with the Indian revolutionary movement, as part of the Ghadar Conspiracy, Satyen Bhushan Sen, Kartar Singh Sarabha, V.G. Pingle and a batch of Sikh revolutionaries sailed from America by the S. S. Salamin in the second half of October 1914. Satyen and Pingle halted in China for a few days to meet the Gadhar leaders (mainly Tahal Singh) for future plans. They met Dr Sun Yat-Sen for co-operation. Dr Sun was not prepared to displease the British. After Satyen and party left for India, Tahal sent Atmaram Kapur, Santosh Singh and Shiv Dayal Kapur to Bangkok for necessary arrangements.A.C. Bose, Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, pp. 87–8, p. 132. Statemt of Pingle and Mula Singh to Cleveland, d/31-3-1915, H.P. 1916, May 436-439B. Notes on Tahal, Roll 6, RG 118. Also, the Rowlatt Report §110, §121 and §138. And Bimanbehari Majumdar, Militant Nationalism in India, p. 167 In November 1914, Pingle, Kartar Singh and Satyen Sen arrived in Calcutta. Satyen introduced Pingle and Kartar Singh to Jatin Mukherjee. \\"Pingle had long talks with Jatin Mukherjee, who sent them to Rash Behari\\" in Benares with necessary information during the third week of December.A.C. Bose, pp. 161–2 Satyen remained in Calcutta at 159 Bow Bazar Street. Charles Tegart, the Calcutta police superintendent, was informed of an attempt to tamper with some Sikh troops at the Dakshineswar gunpowder magazine. \\"A reference to the Military authorities shows that the troops in question were the 93rd Burmans\\" sent to Mesopotamia. Jatin Mukherjee and Satyen Bhushan Sen were seen interviewing these Sikhs.Terrorism in Bengal, Government of West Bengal, Vol. III, p. 505 Since 1900, the Extremist leaders under Lokamanya Tilak's inspiration, turned Benares into a centre for sedition. Sundar Lal (b. 1885, son of Tota Ram, Muzaffarnagar) had given a very objectionable speech in 1907 on Shivaji Festival in Benares. Follower of Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Sri Aurobindo, in 1908 this man had accompanied Lala in his UP lecture tour. His organ, the Swarajya of Allahabad, was warned in April 1908 against sedition. On 22 August 1909, Sundar Lal and Sri Aurobindo delivered \\"mischievous speeches\\" in College Square, Calcutta. The Karmayogi in Hindi was issued in Allahabad since September 1909: controlled by Sri Aurobindo, the Calcutta Karmagogin was edited by Amarendra Chatterjee who had introduced Rash Behari to Sundar Lal. In 1915, Pingle will be received in Allahabad by the Swarajya group.J.C. Ker, pp. 373–5 Rash Behari had been in Benares since early 1914. Large number of outrages were committed there between October 1914 and September 1915, 45 of them before February was over. On 18 November 1914, while examining two bomb caps, he and Sachin Sanyal had been injured. They shifted to a house in Bangalitola, where Pingle visited him with a letter from Jatin Mukherjee and reported that some 4,000 Sikhs of the Ghadar had already reached Calcutta. 15,000 more were waiting to come and join the rebellion.Rowlatt, §121, §132-§138 Behari sent Pingle and Sachin to Amritsar, to discuss with Mula Singh who had come from Shanghai. Rash Behari's man of confidence, Pingle led a hectic life in UP and Punjab for several weeks.Terrorism in Bengal,[abbrev. Terrorism], Vol. V, p. 170 During the Komagata Maru affray in Budge Budge, near Calcutta, on 29 September 1914, Baba Gurdit Singh had contacted Atulkrishna Ghosh and Satish Chakravarti, two eminent associates of Jatin Mukherjee, who actively assisted them. Since then, angry letters from US-based Indians reached India with hope of a German victory; one of the emigrant leaders warned that his associates were in touch with the Bengal revolutionary party. It was at this juncture, in December 1914, that Pingle arrived in the Punjab, promising Bengali co-operation to the malcontent emigrants. A meeting demanded revolution, plundering of Government treasuries, seduction of Indian troops, collection of arms, preparation of bombs and the commission of dacoties. Rash Behari planned collecting gangs of villagers for the rebellion. Simultaneous outbreaks at Lahore, Ferozepore & Rawalpindi was designed. Rising at Dacca, Benares, Jubbalpur to be extended.Rowlatt, §138 Preparing bombs was a definite part of the Ghadar programme. The Sikh conspirators – knowing very little about it – decided to call in a Bengali expert, as they had known in California Professor Surendra Bose, associate of Taraknath Das. Towards the end of December 1914, at a meeting at Kapurthala, Pingle announced that a Bengali babu was ready to co- operate with them. On 3 January 1915, Pingle and Sachindra in Amritsar received Rs 500 from the Ghadar, and returned to Benares.James Campbell Ker, Political Trouble in India,[abbrev. Ker], p. 367 Pingle returned to Calcutta with Rash Behari's invitation to the Jugantar leaders to meet him at Benares for co-ordinating and finalising their plans. Jatin Mukherjee, Atulkrishna Ghosh, Naren Bhattacharya left for Benares (early January 1915). In a very important meeting, Rash Behari announced the rebellion, proclaiming : \\"Die for their country.\\" Though through Havildar Mansha Singh, the 16th Rajput Rifles at Fort William was successfully approached, Jatin Mukherjee wanted two months for the army revolt, synchronising with the arrival of the German arms. He modified the plan according to the impatience of the Gadhar militants to rush to action. Rash Behari and Pingle went to Lahore. Sachin tampered with the 7th Rajputs (Benares) and the 89th Punjabis at Dinapore. Damodar Sarup [Seth] went to Allahabad. Vinayak Rao Kapile conveyed bombs from Bengal to Punjab. Bibhuti [Haldar, approver] and Priyo Nath [Bhattacharya?] seduced the troops at Benares; Nalini [Mukherjee] at Jabalpur. On 14 February, Kapile carried from Benares to Lahore a parcel containing materials for 18 bombs.Rowlatt, §121. Also Ker, pp. 377–8 By the middle of January, Pingle was back in Amritsar with \\"the fat babu\\" (Rash Behari); to avoid too many visitors, Rash Behari moved to Lahore after a fortnight. In both the places he collected materials for making bombs and ordered for 80 bomb cases to a foundry at Lahore. Its owner out of suspicion refused to execute the order. Instead, inkpots were used as cases in several of the dacoities. Completed bombs were found during house searches, while Rash Behari escaped. \\"By then effective contact had been established between the returned Gadharites and the revolutionaries led by Rash Behari, and a large section of soldiers in the NW were obviously disaffected.\\" \\"It was expected that as soon as the signal was received there would be mutinies and popular risings from the Punjab to Bengal.\\" \\"48 out of the 81 accused in the Lahore conspiracy case, including Rash Behari's close associates like Pingle, Mathura Singh & Kartar Singh Sarabha, recently arrived from North America.\\"A.C. Bose, pp. 124–5 Along with Rash Behari Bose, Sachin Sanyal and Kartar Singh, Pingle became one of the main coordinators of the attempted mutiny in February 1915. Under Rash Behari, Pingle issued intensive propaganda for revolution from December 1914, sometimes disguised as Shyamlal, a Bengali; sometimes Ganpat Singh, a Punjabi.B.B. Majumdar, p. 167 Confident of being able to rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. The 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal revolutionaries contacted the Sikh troops stationed at Dacca through letters of introduction sent by Sikh soldiers of Lahore, and succeeded in winning them over.B.B. Majumdar, p. 169 The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately. However, the Punjab CID successfully infiltrated the conspiracy at the last moment through Kirpal Singh: a cousin of the trooper Balwant Singh (23rd Cavalry), US-returned Kirpal, a spy, visited Rash Behari's Lahore headquarters near the Mochi Gate, where over a dozen leaders including Pingle met on 15 February 1915. Kirpal informed the police.J.C. Ker, p. 369 Sensing that their plans had been compromised, the D-day was brought forward to 19 February, but even these plans found their way to the Punjab CID. Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 February were thwarted. Attempted revolts in the 26th Punjab, 7th Rajput, 130th Baluch, 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments were suppressed. Mutinies in Firozpur, Lahore, and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested, although some managed to escape or evade arrest. A last-ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut. Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore, but was arrested in Benares, and V. G. Pingle was apprehended from the lines of the 12th Cavalry at Meerut, in the night of 23 March 1915. He carried \\"ten bombs of the pattern used in the attempt to assassinate Lord Hardinge in Delhi,\\" according to Mumbai police report.B.B. Majumdar, p. 169. It is said that it was enough to blow up an entire regiment. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled to Thailand or other sympathetic nations. Trial and execution Vishnu Ganesh Pingle and a number of other Ghadarites including Kartar Singh Sarabha, Harnam Singh and Bhai Paramanand were tried in the Lahore Conspiracy trial in April 1915 by a special tribunal constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915, for their roles in the February plot. Pingle was executed by hanging at the Lahore Central Jail on 16 November 1915, along with Kartar Singh. Legacy A street in central Mumbai suburb of Chinchpokli is named after him. Pingle's granddaughter Rajani Patil is a politician. She has served as a Member of the Indian Parliament.

Zimmerman (September 21, 1910 - April 2, 1987) was an American musician, teacher and double-bass player. Life and career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1910, Oscar Zimmerman was the double bassist with the Rochester Philharmonic for 36 years and professor emeritus at Eastman, was a member of the first graduating class of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he studied with Philadelphia Orchestra principal bassist Anton Torello. Hired by the Philadelphia Orchestra as a 19-year-old student, he played with the orchestra for six years until joining the St. Louis Symphony as principal bass player in 1936. He played with the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini from 1938-45 before moving to Rochester. As a teacher, taught at the Eastman School of Music, but also spent 44 successive summers teaching at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan. His former students have filled positions (many of them as principal players) in the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra and the symphony orchestras of Atlanta, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Dallas, and Ottawa. Zimmerman died in Traverse City, Michigan in 1987. Instruments His favorite instrument was a Gagliano he bought while still at Curtis from Torello. He called it the Black Gagliano because he had two, a yellow and black. For the last ten years of his life he had two basses, a Francesco Rugieri and a Hugo Rautmann. He heard Waldemar Giese play the Scontrino Concerto, on the Rautmann with Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra while a student a Curtis. He was so impressed with the projection that he bought the bass at Giese's death (1948) and used it for all his solo work. Degrees and studies B.M., Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

Club career On 1 July 2002, Demba signed for English club Yeovil Town on a one-year contract with the option for a second, after being top scorer for K.V. Oostende in the Belgian third division (9 goals in 15 games). He had briefly been on trial at Yeovil in the previous season. He made his debut for the Conference club on 17 August 2002 in a 2-2 draw with Gravesend & Northfleet at Huish Park. He came on as a 16th-minute substitute for Adam Stansfield, who had suffered a serious injury. With Stansfield ruled out long-term, Demba made his first start three days later in a 1-2 defeat at Barnet, playing 70 minutes before being replaced by Chris Giles. On 14 September, he scored his first goal for the club to rescue a 2-2 draw away at Stevenage Borough, having been brought on at half time in place of Anthony Tonkin by manager Gary Johnson and heading in a cross by Lee Johnson. A week later in a 3-0 home win over Halifax Town, he was brought down for a penalty by opposing goalkeeper Lee Butler, resulting in a red card, but was himself sent off for foul and abusive language, and his teammate Terry Skiverton also dismissed. He scored five further goals in the season, all in the next three games: one in a 4-0 win over Woking three days later, a first- half hat-trick in a 6-0 win against Southport on 5 October, and the opener in a 1-2 draw at Burton Albion three days after that. Yeovil won the Conference, earning promotion to The Football League for the first time. International career Demba represented Mali at the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia. His first appearance came in their second group game on 30 January, a 3-1 win over Burkina Faso, replacing Soumaila Coulibaly in added time. Three days later he started in place of Coulibaly, in a 1-1 draw with Senegal. Mali eventually came fourth.

About the same time as the \\"Soviet deployment\\" into Afghanistan, the United States began giving several hundred million dollars a year in aid to the Afghan Mujahideen insurgents fighting the Afghan Marxist government and the Soviet Army in Operation Cyclone. Along with native Afghan mujahideen were Muslim volunteers from other countries, popularly known as \\"Afghan Arabs\\". The most famous of the Afghan Arabs was Osama bin Laden, known at the time as a wealthy and pious Saudi who provided his own money and helped raise millions from other wealthy Gulf Arabs. When the war ended, bin Laden organized the al- Qaeda organization to carry on armed jihad in other venues, primarily against the United States—the country that had helped fund the mujahideen against the Soviets. A number of commentators have described Al-Qaeda attacks as \\"blowback\\" or an unintended consequence of American aid to the mujahideen. In response, the American government, American and Pakistani intelligence officials involved in the operation, and at least one journalist (Peter Bergen) have denied this theory. They maintain the aid was given out by the Pakistan government, that it went to Afghan not foreign mujahideen, and that there was no contact between the Afghan Arabs (foreign mujahideen) and the CIA and other American officials, let alone the arming, training, coaching or indoctrination. Allegations The Guardian alleges that the Central Intelligence Agency helped Osama bin Laden build an underground camp at Khost, which bin Laden used to train Mujahideen soldiers. The United States would later attack this camp when bin Laden was held responsible for the United States embassy bombings in Africa. In a 2004 article entitled \\"Al-Qaeda's origins and links\\", the BBC wrote: > During the anti-Soviet war Bin Laden and his fighters received American and > Saudi funding. Some analysts believe Bin Laden himself had security training > from the CIA. Robin Cook, Foreign Secretary in the UK from 1997–2001, believed the CIA had provided arms to the Arab mujahideen, including Osama bin Laden, writing, \\"Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the '80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage war against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.\\" In conversation with former British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, two-time Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto said Osama bin Laden was initially pro-American. Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, has also stated that bin Laden once expressed appreciation for the United States' help in Afghanistan. On CNN's Larry King program he said: > Bandar bin Sultan: This is ironic. In the mid-'80s, if you remember, we and > the United - Saudi Arabia and the United States were supporting the > Mujahideen to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets. He [Osama bin Laden] > came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends, to help > us against the atheists, he said the communists. Isn't it ironic? Larry > King: How ironic. In other words, he came to thank you for helping bring > America to help him. Bandar bin Sultan: Right. Opposing view Peter Bergen U.S. government officials and a number of other parties maintain that the U.S. supported only the indigenous Afghan mujahideen. They deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with Bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated him. Many American scholars and reporters have called the idea of a CIA-backed Al Qaeda \\"nonsense\\", \\"sheer fantasy\\", and \\"simply a folk myth.\\" They argue that: *With a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land. *With several hundred million dollars a year in funding from non- American, Muslim sources, Arab Afghans themselves would have no need for American funds. *Americans could not train mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of U.S. agents to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan. *The Afghan Arabs were militant Islamists, reflexively hostile to Westerners, and prone to threaten or attack Westerners even though they knew the Westerners were helping the mujahideen. *The US government greatly feared arming or training Arabs would lead to attacks on Israel with those arms or training. Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri says much the same thing in his book Knights Under the Prophet's Banner. Bin Laden himself once said \\"The collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,\\" but \\"collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant.\\"Messages to the World, 2006, p.50. (March 1997 interview with Peter Arnett In Ghost Wars (2004), Steve Coll recounted: \\"Bin Laden moved within Saudi intelligence's compartmented operations, outside of CIA eyesight. CIA archives contain no record of any direct contact between a CIA officer and bin Laden during the 1980s.\\" According to CNN journalist Peter Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, \\"Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently.\\" Bergen quotes Pakistani Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, who ran the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Afghan operation between 1983 and 1987: > It was always galling to the Americans, and I can understand their point of > view, that although they paid the piper they could not call the tune. The > CIA supported the mujahideen by spending the taxpayers' money, billions of > dollars of it over the years, on buying arms, ammunition, and equipment. It > was their secret arms procurement branch that was kept busy. It was, > however, a cardinal rule of Pakistan's policy that no Americans ever become > involved with the distribution of funds or arms once they arrived in the > country. No Americans ever trained or had direct contact with the > mujahideen, and no American official ever went inside Afghanistan. Marc Sageman, a Foreign Service Officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987–1989, and worked closely with Afghanistan's Mujahideen, states that no American money went to the foreign volunteers. Sageman also says: > Contemporaneous accounts of the war do not even mention [the Afghan Arabs]. > Many were not serious about the war. ... Very few were involved in actual > fighting. For most of the war, they were scattered among the Afghan groups > associated with the four Afghan fundamentalist parties. > No U.S. official ever came in contact with the foreign volunteers. They > simply traveled in different circles and never crossed U.S. radar screens. > They had their own sources of money and their own contacts with the > Pakistanis, official Saudis, and other Muslim supporters, and they made > their own deals with the various Afghan resistance leaders.\\" Vincent Cannistraro, who led the Reagan administration's Afghan Working Group from 1985 to 1987, puts it, > The CIA was very reluctant to be involved at all. They thought it would end > up with them being blamed, like in Guatemala.\\" So the Agency tried to avoid > direct involvement in the war, ... the skittish CIA, Cannistraro estimates, > had less than ten operatives acting as America's eyes and ears in the > region. Milton Bearden, the Agency's chief field operative in the war > effort, has insisted that \\"[T]he CIA had nothing to do with\\" bin Laden. > Cannistraro says that when he coordinated Afghan policy from Washington, he > never once heard bin Laden's name. Fox News reporter Richard Miniter wrote that in interviews with the two men who \\"oversaw the disbursement for all American funds to the anti-Soviet resistance, Bill Peikney—CIA station chief in Islamabad from 1984 to 1986—and Milt Bearden—CIA station chief from 1986 to 1989—he found, > Both flatly denied that any CIA funds ever went to bin Laden. They felt so > strongly about this point that they agreed to go on the record, an unusual > move by normally reticent intelligence officers. Mr. Peikney added in an > e-mail to me: “I don’t even recall UBL [bin Laden] coming across my screen > when I was there. Other reasons advanced for a lack of a CIA-Afghan Arab connection of \\"pivotal importance,\\" (or even any connection at all), was that the Afghan Arabs themselves were not important in the war but were a \\"curious sideshow to the real fighting.\\" One estimate of the number of combatants in the war is that 250,000 Afghans fought 125,000 Soviet troops, but only 2000 Arab Afghans fought \\"at any one time\\". According to Milton Bearden the CIA did not recruit Arabs because there were hundreds of thousands of Afghans all too willing to fight. The Arab Afghans were not only superfluous but \\"disruptive,\\" angering local Afghans with their more-Muslim-than-thou attitude, according to Peter Jouvenal. Veteran Afghan cameraman Peter Jouvenal quotes an Afghan mujahideen as saying \\"whenever we had a problem with one of them [foreign mujahideen], we just shot them. They thought they were kings.\\" Many who traveled in Afghanistan, including Olivier Roy and Peter Jouvenal, reported of the Arab Afghans' visceral hostility to Westerners in Afghanistan to aid Afghans or report on their plight. BBC reporter John Simpson tells the story of running into Osama bin Laden in 1989, and with neither knowing who the other was, bin Laden attempting to bribe Simpson's Afghan driver $500—a large sum in a poor country—to kill the infidel Simpson. When the driver declined, Bin Laden retired to his \\"camp bed\\" and wept \\"in frustration.\\" Agreements Sir Martin Ewans, noted that the Afghan Arabs \\"benefited indirectly from the CIA's funding, through the ISI and resistance organizations,\\" and that \\"it has been reckoned that as many as 35,000 'Arab-Afghans' may have received military training in Pakistan at an estimated cost of $800 million in the years up to and including 1988.\\" Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as Jalaluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who were key allies of Bin Laden over many years. Haqqani—one of Bin Laden's closest associates in the 1980s—received direct cash payments from CIA agents, without the mediation of the ISI (Charlie Wilson described Haqqani as \\"goodness personified\\"). This independent source of funding gave Haqqani disproportionate influence over the mujahideen, and helped Bin Laden develop his base. Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an associate of Bin Laden's, was given visas to enter the US on four occasions by the CIA. Rahman was recruiting Arabs to fight in the Soviet-Afghan war, and Egyptian officials testified that the CIA actively assisted him. Rahman was a co-plotter of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. One allegation not denied by the US government is that the U.S. Army enlisted and trained a former Egyptian soldier named Ali Mohamed, and that it knew Ali occasionally took trips to Afghanistan, where he claimed to fight Russians. According to journalist Lawrence Wright, who interviewed U.S. officials about Ali, the Egyptian did tell his Army superiors he was fighting in Afghanistan, but did not tell them he was training other Afghan Arabs or writing a manual from what he had learned from the US Army Special Forces. Wright also reports that the CIA failed to inform other US agencies that it had learned Ali, who was a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, was an anti-American spy.

In the summer of 2005 he was working as an apprentice jockey at Colonial Downs racetrack in New Kent County, Virginia. Like many jockeys, Emanuel Jose Sanchez struggled to maintain his weight to meet the requirements for racing. According to Christian Olmo, a fellow Puerto Rican jockey and close friend who grew up with Sanchez, he had no visions of grandeur but had a passion for riding horses. Sanchez won one race during his short career in the United States. Riding the mare Mark Me Special he captured the 7th race at Colonial Downs on June 19, 2005. According to the Washington Post, \\"Sanchez was so unsteady after crossing the finish line at Colonial Downs, he needed help guiding the horse into the winner's circle\\". On a hot Friday, July 22, shortly after riding a horse named Bear On Tour in the fourth race at Colonial Downs, Sanchez was found collapsed on the floor of the shower in the jockey's room. Rushed to Richmond Community Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, he died on Saturday morning from the effects of dehydration. His death as a result of dieting was the first of two in 2005. On November 12, Louisville, Kentucky jockey Chris Herrell also died as a result of crash dieting. Emanuel Jose Sanchez's remains were returned to his native Puerto Rico for burial.

Deviled crab croquettes originated in Tampa, Florida, where they were developed in the Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrant community of Ybor City. It is typically served for lunch or as a snack, and it is meant to be eaten with one hand. Deviled crabs are somewhat similar to boardwalk-style Maryland crab cakes. Differences include the oblong shape, the seasonings used, and the preferred method of eating (by hand). Since deviled crabs were designed to be hand-held, they are packed together more densely than a crab cake so as to not come apart easily. Preparation and description The deviled crab is prepared by slowly sautéing blue crab meat with a seasoning sauce made with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and various other flavors. This seasoning sauce is a version of a Cuban-style enchilada / sofrito sauce, known locally as \\"chilau\\". Once most of the liquid is gone, the cooked crab meat is rolled in breadcrumbs (traditionally stale Cuban bread) and hand-formed into the approximate shape of a rugby football or small potato, then deep fried until brown. Early versions of the recipe usually contained more spicy chili pepper than modern versions, thus giving them the appellation \\"deviled\\" in English. As the croqueta's spiciness was toned down to account for a wider range of tastes, various pepper sauces became a common condiment utilized by those who liked their deviled crabs hot.food museum blog: Devil Crabs Served Up With Cuban Luvvvvvv History Deviled crabs originated in the Spanish/Cuban/Italian immigrant community of Ybor City, Tampa, Florida during a late-1920s strike in the area's cigar factories.

He established a modest shop in 1775 at 57 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré (which would become No. 19 when the street was renumbered in 1806). He chose a basket of flowers to identify the front of his shop and that emblem will remain the symbol of Houbigant through the years. History  Jean-François Houbigant was born in Paris, France, on 21 December 1752 to Nicolas Houbigant and Geneviève Rolinart, both servants. His mother worked for the Duchess of Charost, who owned a mansion at what is now 39 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré. It is said that the Duchess was very kind and that she decided to take Jean- François under her wing by giving him an education and a modest nest egg to start in life. At the time, the fashion for perfume, powders, and blushes was in full swing primarily because of the awful stench in the streets of Paris and from its inhabitants. The young Jean-François worked his way into this community of merchants, who were licensed to make and sell perfumes, powders, ointments, soaps, scented water, gloves, mittens, and knitted leather. The statutes in this community, which required four years of education followed by three years of apprenticeship, were enacted in 1190 during the reign of Philippe II, duke of Orléans (also known as Philippe-Auguste), and were renewed by Louis XIV in 1656. Patents cost 50 pounds and 550 pounds for certification. Madame Houbigant, born Nicole Adéläide Deschamps (Merry-Joseph Blondel, c. 1807) Jean-François Houbigant would thus become a master perfumer under the tutelage of his future father-in-law, allowing him to open a shop and sell his own products. He chose a trendy area and a street where new mansions were under construction, such as the Hotel d’Évreux (which later became the Elysée Palace), the Hotel Beauvau, and the Hotel Edmond de Rothschild. Age 23 at the time, he rented a boutique on this street and took as his trademark the phrase: “Houbigant is a perfume merchant, glove manufacturer, and creator of powders, ointments, and the highest-quality blush; he also makes and sells assorted wedding and christening baskets”. His ledger from 1777 to 1782 shows that much nobility came to his shop, such as the Duchess of Charost (of course), the knight Jean de Manville, the Viscountess of St. Hermine, the Marquis of La Rochelambert, the Viscount of Choiseul, the Marquise of Erneville, Father of Osmond, and the Countess of Matignon. Having established his business, in June 1781 he married Nicole Adéläide Deschamps. The couple waited until 1790 to have their only child, Armand Gustave, who unfortunately did not follow the family trade. The history of France took a sharp turn during the French Revolution (1789–1799), but Jean-François’ business came out unscathed. Subsequent years brought an avalanche of change: the First Republic in 1792, the Reign of Terror in 1793, the National Convention in 1794, the Directory in 1795, the French Consulate in 1799, the Concordat of 1801, and finally the establishment of the First French Empire by Napoleon in 1804. Interest in perfumes and powders did not weaken during this time, and as the clientele changed, Jean-François adapted his business. On 22 October 1807, Jean-François Houbigant died at the age of 55, without knowing that his name would go down in history. He left a thriving business to his wife and son. In order to continue the work of her late husband and because of the statutes in this profession, Nicole Adelaide had no choice but to marry the chief clerk of the store.

The community was laid out by John Baldwin in 1836, around his sawmill. Baldwin named the town after a friend, Robert T. Lytle, a Democrat who was a U.S. Congressman from Ohio from 1833 to 1835. History At one time, Lytleville was a thriving village of with a population of about 100. Possibly the first water-powered sawmill and grist mill in McLean County were located here, having been built by James Hedrick in 1833. Three years later, he sold it to Baldwin. Baldwin had been a wicked and boisterous man, then was converted and became a preacher. He engaged in revival work with great spirit and zeal. He was considered crazy by many, but faithful to his profession was Baldwin. Stories are told of his prophesying when under strong religious excitement, but there is no record of fulfillment. His brother James Baldwin was the earliest doctor in the community and lived on a farm east of the mill property. John Baldwin had a “wicked partner” who persisted in running the mill on Sunday. It was an old-fashioned gate-saw, which went so slow that there seemed to be a sort of an excuse for putting in all the time when the water was up. Baldwin used to go to the mill Sundays and expostulate with his partner, and while arguing the matter (the mill running in the meantime), the sawyer would get him to help turn down the log and set the tail end for him. All these kind acts did not convert him and the partnership dissolved. A bustling trading center for dry goods, groceries and whiskey, it contested strongly with Waynesville and Bloomington for the chief place in the future greatness of this part of the county. A post office was established, stores and trade grew up, and it reportedly lacked but one vote of the committee to be the county seat of McLean County (information given here acquired from Dave Hartson, born in Lytleville in 1834. Mr. Hartson died July 1922, six weeks after the author’s visit). There has been considerable controversy about this, one side holding that it was at one time considered for the Illinois state capital, the other side holding that it was considered only for county seat. The capital has changed twice since 1818, once from Kaskaskia to Vandalia, and once from Vandalia to Springfield. The first was before Lytleville was founded; therefore, the only time it could conceivable have been considered was in 1836 when Springfield, Illiopolis, and several other towns were in competition. This seems unlikely as the village had barely even been laid out by this time. The first school, Lytleville School No. 18, was a log house with crude benches and slabs on pegs for seats built in the 1830s. Later, a frame house was erected in the 1840s just across the road to the north. A Methodist church, at the south end of State Street, was built in 1874 and sold to the school district in 1886. This building served as a schoolhouse with remodeling and standardizing in 1921. It burned Jan. 15, 1931 and a new schoolhouse costing about $2,800 was built in the summer of 1931. Though the attendance dwindled as compared to the large enrollments of former years, it remained a place for public meetings. Lytleville school joined the Heyworth Community Unit School District in 1948 and the building was sold, becoming a private residence that still stands. Around 1854, the Illinois Central Railroad began building its main line through McLean County. During a heated contest to decide the exact location of the railroad, Heyworth founder Campbell Wakefield donated land to railroad officials to entice them to build through his land, which the company eventually did. This placed the rail line about three miles west of Lytleville, which declined rapidly in the following years as people moved to the new town of Heyworth. Today, there is little trace of the original village except a scattering of homes, none of which are original to the village of Lytleville. A later version of the Lytleville School, rebuilt in the 1930s following a fire, serves as a private residence.

Cutouts usually know only the source and destination of the information to be transmitted, not the identities of any other persons involved in the espionage process (need to know basis). Thus, a captured cutout cannot be used to identify members of an espionage cell. The cutout also isolates the source from the destination, so neither necessarily knows the other.  Outside espionage  Some computer protocols, like Tor, use the equivalent of cutout nodes in their communications networks. The use of multiple layers of encryption usually stops nodes on such networks from knowing the ultimate sender or receiver of the data. In computer networking, darknets have some cutout functionality. Darknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, as sharing is anonymous, i.e., IP addresses are not publicly shared and nodes often forward traffic to other nodes. Thus, with a darknet, users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.

The manor and church were held by the monks of Taunton Priory until the dissolution of the monasteries and after that by the Portmans of Orchard Portman. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

It consists of a band or sheet of connective tissue fibres, primarily collagen, that attaches, stabilizes, encloses and separates muscles not limited to the lumbar region as the name suggests, but extending upwards over the thorax to the neck and downwards over the muscles covering the sacrum. The upper thoracic portion is thin while the lumbar and sacral regions are thicker and stronger. Function The lumbar fascia binds the deep muscles of the back to the spine and to the transverse processes of the vertebrae. Additionally the lumbar fascia is an attachment for the gluteus maximus muscle and the latissimus dorsi muscle.2. Extent The posterior layer covers the loin and continues upwards on the back of the thorax and the neck while middle and the anterior layers are confined to the lumbar region. Attachments =Posterior layer= Medially, the posterior layer attaches to the tips of the lumbar and sacral spines and the interspinous ligaments. To the sides it blends with the middle layer at the lateral border of the erector spinae muscle group that extends the vertebral column (bending the spine so the head moves back relative to the chest), also known as sacrospinalis in older texts and more recently as extensor spinae,[3] though this term is not in widespread use. Superiorly it continues on to the back of the thorax where it attaches to the vertebral spines and the ribs, inferiorly to the posterior quarter of the outer lip of the Iliac crest. =Middle layer= Left hip-joint, opened by removing the floor of the acetabulum from within the pelvis. (Trans. ligament labeled at center.) Medially, the middle layer attaches to the tips of the lumbar transverse processes and the transverse ligaments, laterally, it blends with the anterior layer at the lateral border of the quadratus lumborum, and superiorly it attaches to the lower border of the 12th rib and to the lumbocostal ligament and inferiorly, it attaches to the posterior part of the intermediate area of the Iliac crest.[3] =Anterior layer= Medially, the anterior layer attaches to the vertical ridges on the anterior surface of the lumbar transverse processes, laterally it blends with the middle layer at the lateral border of the quadratus lumborum and superiorly, it forms the lateral arcuate ligament, extending from the tip of the first lumbar transverse process to the 12th rib and inferiorly, it attaches to the inner lip of the iliac crest and iliolumbar ligament.

Mary Surratt was the first woman publicly executed in the United States, for her role in the Lincoln Assassination. There is no verifiable proof Lavinia Fisher existed. Her origins are unknown; however, Fisher resided in the United States for much of her life. She was married to John Fisher, and both were convicted of highway robbery—a capital offense at the time—not murder. Historians have begun to question the veracity of the traditional legend and some assert that Lavinia Fisher never killed anyone. She was, however, an active member of a large gang of highwaymen who operated out of two houses in the backcountry near Charleston, the Five Mile House and the Six Mile House. It is not clear whether the Six Mile House was a hotel, but it served as a hideout for a number of outlaws. Residence Fisher and her husband resided in Charleston, South Carolina for most of their lives. Together, they owned an inn, the Six Mile Wayfarer House, which they managed in the early 19th century. The hotel was located six miles north of Charleston, hence the name. During the couple's time there, reports were made to the local sheriff about guests disappearing. Due to lack of evidence, and the popularity of the couple with many locals, these complaints came to nothing. Alleged crimes Lavinia Fisher would invite lone travelers into the Six Mile Wayfarer House to dinner and ask them questions about their occupations, trying to determine if they had money. She would send them up to their rooms with a cup of poisoned tea. Once the men drank their tea and went to bed, her husband would go to the room to make sure they were dead by stabbing them. Another version of the legend was that the tea would only put the men to sleep for a few hours. Then, when they were almost asleep, Lavinia would pull a lever and the bed would collapse and drop the victim into a pit. Some believed that there were spikes waiting at the bottom of the pit. Much of what actually occurred in the alleged murders at the hands of John and Lavinia Fisher has become wildly exaggerated through time, so factual details are hard to find. However, contemporary news accounts in the Charleston Post and Courier, claimed that a vigilante gang went to the Fishers' neighborhood in February 1819 to stop the purported 'gang activities' that were occurring there. Satisfied that they had accomplished their task, the group returned to Charleston, but left a young man by the name of David Ross to stand watch in the area. Early the next day, Ross was attacked by two men and dragged before the gang that had terrorized the region. Among them was Lavinia Fisher, to whom he looked for help. However, rather than help him, she choked him and then smashed his head through a window. Ross managed to escape and immediately alerted authorities. Immediately following this incident, another traveler named John Peeples asked if there were any vacancies; Lavinia replied that there was unfortunately no room, but he was welcome to come inside and rest and have some tea. John happened to hate tea, and not wanting to seem rude, he dumped it when she wasn't looking. She interrogated him for hours and eventually said she discovered that in fact, they did have a room. He then went to bed. He had felt suspicious about the interrogation and was worried about being robbed, so he decided to sleep in the wooden chair by the door. In the middle of the night, he awoke to the loud sound of the bed collapsing and discovered the Fishers' plan. He jumped out the window and rode to Charleston to alert the authorities. Based on these two accounts, the assailants were finally identified by name, something that law enforcement had previously lacked. Police were immediately dispatched to the location and during the ensuing investigation Lavinia and John were located, along with two other gang members. John Fisher surrendered the group in an effort to protect his wife and shield her from possible gunfire. Later, during interrogation, he again attempted to protect Lavinia by giving the identities of all involved in the gang. Trial and execution Nearly a full year elapsed between the time of their arrest and their execution. At their arraignment the Fishers pleaded not guilty but were ordered to be held in jail until their trial, which would take place in May, while their co-conspirators were released on bail. At their trial the jury rejected their pleas of innocence and found them guilty of highway robbery, a capital offense. However, the judge allowed an appeal and they were given a reprieve until the January session of the court. During this time the Fishers occupied themselves with plans to escape, as they were housed together at the Charleston, South Carolina jail (the \\"Old City Jail\\") in a 6x8 cell and not heavily guarded. On September 13 they put their plans into action and began their escape. Things did not go as planned as the rope they had made from prison linens broke, leaving Lavinia trapped in the cell and John set free. He was unwilling to continue the escape plan and was recaptured. The two were then kept under much tighter security. The Constitutional court rejected their appeals and on February 4, 1820 both were sentenced to be hanged. Awaiting execution, John accepted the counsel of the Reverend Richard Furman, a local minister, but Lavinia became even more vitriolic. On the gallows in front of the Old City Jail before John Fisher's execution, Rev. Furman read aloud a letter John had composed, which stated that since he had become a Christian he could not be executed with a lie held to his account. Therefore, he insisted on his innocence and asked mercy on those who had done him wrong in the judicial process. After the minister read the letter, Fisher then began to plead his case before the gathered crowd of some 2,000. He then seemingly contradicted himself by asking for their forgiveness. Believing that she would be pardoned up until the moment she was hanged, Lavinia, according to legend, used her last breath to scream, \\"If any of you have a message for the devil, tell me now, for I shall be seeing him shortly.\\" Then jumped off the stand and killed herself. Her ghost is believed by some to haunt the Old Charleston Jail House, and tourists still claim sightings of her ghostly apparition. Burial Lavinia was buried in a potter's field near the Old City Jail. Claims of her burial at 150 Meeting Street (The Circular Congregational Church) or at 4 Archdale Street (The Unitarian Church) appear to have been fictions promoted by tour guides.

The appellation sits at a higher elevation than most of Napa Valley's wine region, resulting in less cool fog coming in from San Pablo Bay, and more direct exposure to sunlight. The soil of this AVA is volcanic and very porous which allows it to cool down quickly despite the increased sunlight. Geography and Climate A Cabernet Sauvignon from the Diamond Mountain District. The entire AVA is over above sea level, which helps to cool it compared to the nearby valley floor appellations. The soil of the Diamond Mountain District is volcanic, including the small bits of volcanic glass that give the area its name. The AVA is defined by the Napa-Sonoma county line on the west, Petrified Forest Road on the north, the 400 foot line of altitude running parallel to Route 29 on the east, and the Spring Mountain District to the south. This puts the southern part of the city of Calistoga, California in the appellation, with the northern part being in the Calistoga AVA since 2010. History Diamond Mountain District's history as a winegrowing region dates back to 1868, when the first vines were planted by Jacob Schram on a tract of land he purchased on the Napa side of the mountain. By 1892, his holdings had expanded to 100 acres, including underground cellars for aging and storing wine. His name has continued in the property, now known as Schramsberg Vineyards =Controversy= When the AVA was proposed in 1999, a request for public comments was published in the Federal Register. One winery, Diamond Mountain Vineyards, objected to the western border ending on the Napa-Sonoma county line, as it would split their property in half. Their objections extended the public comment period by several months. Ultimately, the decision was to keep the boundary on the Napa-Sonoma line. Additionally, as originally proposed, the AVA would have been called the \\"Diamond Mountain AVA,\\" but since the bulk of Diamond Mountain, and indeed, its peak, are in Sonoma County, the AVA was renamed.

Education He had attended schools in Louga and Saint-Louis before becoming a student at the universities of Katibougou (Soudan), Dakar (Senegal), and Paris. He gained diplomas in Oriental Languages, Phonetics, and General Linguistics. Journalist After having completed his university studies, Mr. Diakhate was trained as a journalist and editor. In this part of his professional career he was to occupy important positions in Paris and Dakar. Thus he became chief of the Information Department of SORAFOM (the Société de Radiodiffusion de la France d’Outre-Mer) in Paris, and director of Radiodiffusion du Sénégal (SORAFOM and the government of Senegal) as well as director of the Information Department of Radio de la Fédération du Mali. In his various public functions, Lamine Diakhate published a large number of newspaper articles in journals like Afrique en Marche (Paris), Condition Humaine (Dakar), Dakar Matin or Le Soleil (Dakar). Diplomat After having become a close collaborator of President Senghor, he was made chief of the presidential cabinet (Chef du Cabinet de la Présidence du Sénégal) and Minister of Information, Telecommunication, and Tourism. Later on, he also served as Ambassador of Senegal to Nigeria, the Kingdom of Morocco, and as Permanent Counsellor or Permanent Vice Delegate of Senegal (Conseiller ou Délégué Permanent Adjoint du Sénégal) to the UNESCO in Paris. Writer As a black African author and poet writing in French, Diakhate was one of the leading figures of the Négritude school. In his understanding this literary movement constituted an effort to give voice to the traditions and cultural values of black Africa, and to actively participate in the development of a universal humanism in cooperation with other civilizations. As a literary critic, Diakhate promoted ideas that had originally been formulated, or expressed, by Aimé Césaire, Léon-Gontran Damas, and Léopold Sédar Senghor. He introduced writers of the Négritude school to his readers and analyzed the works of others who did not belong to this school. Together with Aimé Césaire and Alioune Diop he was one of the five members of the editorial committee of Éditions Présence Africaine in Paris. This publishing house later printed several of his poetical works. And in its journal, Présence Africaine, did appear several of his scholarly articles. For several years he also served as secretary for cultural affairs (secrétaire culturel) of the Société Africaine de Culture (SAC). In the course of all of his public functions Mr. Diakhate actively participated in a large number of literary festivals and conferences in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Thus he attended several Biennales Internationales de Poésie, for example the V. and und XII. Biennale of Knokke-Le-Zout in Belgium (September 1961; 1975), the Première and Troisième Biennale de la Langue Française in Namur and Liège (Belgium) in the years 1965 and 1969, the Colloques des Écrivains Afro- Scandinaves in Stockholm, Sweden, the Congrès des Ècrivains Afro-Asiatiques in Beirut, Lebanon in March 1967, the Festival Poétique de Struga (ex-Jugoslavia) in August 1976, the Fourth World Congress of Poets in Seoul, Corea, from July 2 until 7th, 979, as well as the 15e Congrès de l’Union Internationale des Journalistes et de la Presse de Langue Française in Paris from September 29. September until bis October 6, 1979. On several occasions Mr. Diakhate became one of the organizers, for example of the Premier Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres from April 1 until April 24, 1966 in Dakar, the Festival Culturel Panafricain d’Alger of the year 1969, the Journées Culturelles Africaines de Turin, Italy, in April 1967. the Colloque sur la Négritude in Dakar, Senegal, in April 1971, as well as the Introduction à la Poésie de L. S. Senghor in Casablanca, Morokko, in April 1974. Awards The literary merits of Lamine Diakhate as an auteur et poète noire africain d’expression française were formally recognized on several occasions. Thus he was elected a member of the Société des Gens de Lettres de France in November 1976. And he was awarded two literary prizes: The Prix Edgar Poe for the year 1971, granted to him by the Maison de la Poésie in Paris, and the Grand Prix Littéraire de l’Afrique Noire 1979 for his novel Chalys de Harlem.

These integrals have to be computed numerically to within a threshold \\\\epsilon. If the integral is of dimension d then in the worst case, where one has a guarantee of error at most \\\\epsilon, the computational complexity is typically of order \\\\epsilon^{-d}. That is, the problem suffers the curse of dimensionality. In 1977 P. Boyle, University of Waterloo, proposed using Monte Carlo (MC) to evaluate options.Boyle, P. (1977), Options: a Monte Carlo approach, J. Financial Economics, 4, 323-338. Starting in early 1992, J. F. Traub, Columbia University, and a graduate student at the time, S. Paskov, used quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) to price a Collateralized mortgage obligation with parameters specified by Goldman Sachs. Even though it was believed by the world's leading experts that QMC should not be used for high- dimensional integration, Paskov and Traub found that QMC beat MC by one to three orders of magnitude and also enjoyed other desirable attributes. Their results were first publishedPaskov, S. H. and Traub, J. F. (1995), Faster evaluation of financial derivatives, J. Portfolio Management, 22(1), 113-120. in 1995. Today QMC is widely used in the financial sector to value financial derivatives; see list of books below. QMC is not a panacea for all high- dimensional integrals. A number of explanations have been proposed for why QMC is so good for financial derivatives. This continues to be a very fruitful research area. Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods Integrals in hundreds or thousands of variables are common in computational finance. These have to be approximated numerically to within an error threshold \\\\epsilon. It is well known that if a worst case guarantee of error at most \\\\epsilon is required then the computational complexity of integration may be exponential in d, the dimension of the integrand; See Traub, J.

To break this curse of dimensionality one can use the Monte Carlo (MC) method defined by :\\\\varphi^{\\\\mathop{\\\\rm MC}}(f)=\\\\frac 1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i), where the evaluation points x_i are randomly chosen. It is well known that the expected error of Monte Carlo is of order n^{-1/2}. Thus the cost of the algorithm that has error \\\\epsilon is of order \\\\epsilon^{-2} breaking the curse of dimensionality. Of course in computational practice pseudo-random points are used. Figure 1 shows the distribution of 500 pseudo- random points on the unit square. Figure 1. 500 pseudo-random points Note there are regions where there are no points and other regions where there are clusters of points. It would be desirable to sample the integrand at uniformly distributed points. A rectangular grid would be uniform but even if there were only 2 grid points in each Cartesian direction there would be 2^d points. So the desideratum should be as few points as possible chosen as uniform as possible. It turns out there is a well-developed part of number theory which deals exactly with this desideratum. Discrepancy is a measure of deviation from uniformity so what one wants are low discrepancy sequences (LDS).Niederreiter, H. (1992), Random Number Generation and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods, CBMS-NSF Regional Conference Series in Applied Mathematics, SIAM, Philadelphia. Numerous LDS have been created named after their inventors, e.g. *Halton *Hammersley *Sobol *Faure *Niederreiter Figure 2. gives the distribution of 500 LDS points. Figure 2. 500 low discrepancy points The quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method is defined by : \\\\varphi^{\\\\mathop{\\\\rm QMC}}(f)=\\\\frac 1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i), where the x_i belong to an LDS. The standard terminology quasi-Monte Carlo is somewhat unfortunate since MC is a randomized method whereas QMC is purely deterministic. The uniform distribution of LDS is desirable. But the worst case error of QMC is of order :\\\\frac{(\\\\log n)^d}{n}, where n is the number of sample points. See for the theory of LDS and references to the literature. The rate of convergence of LDS may be contrasted with the expected rate of convergence of MC which is n^{-1/2}. For d small the rate of convergence of QMC is faster than MC but for d large the factor (\\\\log n)^d is devastating. For example, if d=360, then even with \\\\log n=2 the QMC error is proportional to 2^{360}. Thus it was widely believed by the world's leading experts that QMC should not be used for high- dimensional integration. For example, in 1992 Bratley, Fox and NiederreiterBratley, P., Fox, B. L. and Niederreiter, H. (1992), Implementation and tests of low-discrepancy sequences, ACM Transactions on Modelling and Computer Simulation, Vol. 2, No. 3, 195-213. performed extensive testing on certain mathematical problems. They conclude \\"in high-dimensional problems (say d > 12), QMC seems to offer no practical advantage over MC\\". In 1993, Rensburg and Torrievan Rensburg, E. J. J. and Torrie, G. M. (1993), Estimation of multidimensional integrals: is Monte Carlo the best method? J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 26(4), 943-953. compared QMC with MC for the numerical estimation of high-dimensional integrals which occur in computing virial coefficients for the hard-sphere fluid. They conclude QMC is more effective than MC only if d<10. As we shall see, tests on 360-dimensional integrals arising from a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) lead to very different conclusions. Woźniakowski's 1991 paperWoźniakowski, H. (1991), Average case complexity of multivariate integration, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (New Ser.), 24(1), 185-194. showing the connection between average case complexity of integration and QMC led to new interest in QMC. Woźniakowski's result received considerable coverage in the scientific pressCipra, Barry Arthur (1991), Multivariate Integration: It ain't so tough (on average), SIAM NEWS, 28 March. .Traub, J. F. and Woźniakowski, H. (1994), Breaking intractability, Scientific American, 270(1), January, 102-107. In early 1992, I. T. Vanderhoof, New York University, became aware of Woźniakowski's result and gave Woźniakowski's colleague J. F. Traub, Columbia University, a CMO with parameters set by Goldman Sachs. This CMO had 10 tranches each requiring the computation of a 360 dimensional integral. Traub asked a Ph.D. student, Spassimir Paskov, to compare QMC with MC for the CMO. In 1992 Paskov built a software system called FinDer and ran extensive tests. To the Columbia's research group's surprise and initial disbelief Paskov reported that QMC was always superior to MC in a number of ways. Details are given below. Preliminary results were presented by Paskov and Traub to a number of Wall Street firms in Fall 1993 and Spring 1994. The firms were initially skeptical of the claim that QMC was superior to MC for pricing financial derivatives. A January 1994 article in Scientific American by Traub and Woźniakowski discussed the theoretical issues and reported that \\"Preliminary results obtained by testing certain finance problems suggests the superiority of the deterministic methods in practice\\". In Fall 1994 Paskov wrote a Columbia University Computer Science Report which appeared in slightly modified form in 1997.Paskov, S. H., New methodologies for valuing derivatives, 545-582, in Mathematics of Derivative Securities, S. Pliska and M. Dempster eds., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. In Fall 1995 Paskov and Traub published a paper in the \\"Journal of Portfolio Management\\". They compared MC and two QMC methods. The two deterministic methods used Sobol and Halton points. Since better LDS were created later, no comparison will be made between Sobol and Halton sequences. The experiments drew the following conclusions regarding the performance of MC and QMC on the 10 tranche CMO: *QMC methods converge significantly faster than MC *MC is sensitive to the initial seed *The convergence of QMC is smoother than the convergence of MC. This makes automatic termination easier for QMC. To summarize, QMC beats MC for the CMO on accuracy, confidence level, and speed. This paper was followed by reports on tests by a number of researchers which also led to the conclusion the QMC is superior to MC for a variety of high- dimensional finance problems.

TezukaTezuka, S., Uniform Random Numbers:Theory and Practice, Kluwer, Netherlands. achieves accuracy 10^{-2} with just 170 points. MC requires 2700 points for the same accuracy. The significance of this is that due to future interest rates and prepayment rates being unknown, financial firms are content with accuracy of 10^{-2}. *Large number of sample points: The advantage of QMC over MC is further amplified as the sample size and accuracy demands grow. In particular, QMC is 20 to 50 times faster than MC with moderate sample sizes, and can be up to 1000 times faster than MC when high accuracy is desired QMC. Currently the highest reported dimension for which QMC outperforms MC is 65536.BRODA Ltd. http://www.broda.co.uk The software is the Sobol' Sequence generator SobolSeq65536 which generates Sobol' Sequences satisfying Property A for all dimensions and Property A' for the adjacent dimensions.

(2012) Construction and Comparison of High-Dimensional Sobol’ Generators, Wilmott, Nov, 64-79 Theoretical explanations The results reported so far in this article are empirical. A number of possible theoretical explanations have been advanced. This has been a very research rich area leading to powerful new concepts but a definite answer has not been obtained. A possible explanation of why QMC is good for finance is the following. Consider a tranche of the CMO mentioned earlier. The integral gives expected future cash flows from a basket of 30-year mortgages at 360 monthly intervals. Because of the discounted value of money variables representing future times are increasingly less important. In a seminal paper I. Sloan and H. WoźniakowskiSloan, I. and Woźniakowski, H. (1998), When are quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms efficient for high dimensional integrals?, J. Complexity, 14(1), 1-33. introduced the idea of weighted spaces. In these spaces the dependence on the successive variables can be moderated by weights. If the weights decrease sufficiently rapidly the curse of dimensionality is broken even with a worst case guarantee. This paper led to a great amount of work on the tractability of integration and other problems.Novak, E. and Wo�zniakowski, H. (2008), Tractability of multivariate problems, European Mathematical Society, Zurich (forthcoming). A problem is tractable when its complexity is of order \\\\epsilon^{-p} and p is independent of the dimension. On the other hand, effective dimension was proposed by Caflisch, Morokoff and OwenCaflisch, R. E., Morokoff, W. and Owen, A. B. (1997), Valuation of mortgage backed securities using Brownian bridges to reduce effective dimension, Journal of Computational Finance, 1, 27-46. as an indicator of the difficulty of high-dimensional integration. The purpose was to explain the remarkable success of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) in approximating the very-high- dimensional integrals in finance. They argued that the integrands are of low effective dimension and that is why QMC is much faster than Monte Carlo (MC). The impact of the arguments of Caflisch et al. was great. A number of papers deal with the relationship between the error of QMC and the effective dimensionHickernell, F. J. (1998), Lattice rules: how well do they measure up?, in P. Hellekalek and G. Larcher (Eds.), Random and Quasi-Random Point Sets, Springer, 109-166. . Wang, X. and Sloan, I. H. (2005), Why are high- dimensional finance problems often of low effective dimension?, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 27(1), 159-183. It is known that QMC fails for certain functions that have high effective dimension. However, low effective dimension is not a necessary condition for QMC to beat MC and for high- dimensional integration to be tractable. In 2005, TezukaTezuka, S. (2005), On the necessity of low-effective dimension, Journal of Complexity, 21, 710-721. exhibited a class of functions of d variables, all with maximum effective dimension equal to d. For these functions QMC is very fast since its convergence rate is of order n^{-1}, where n is the number of function evaluations. Isotropic integrals QMC can also be superior to MC and to other methods for isotropic problems, that is, problems where all variables are equally important. For example, Papageorgiou and TraubPapageorgiou, A. and Traub, J. F. (1997), Faster evaluation of multidimensional integrals, Computers in Physics, 11(6), 574-578. reported test results on the model integration problems suggested by the physicist B. D. KeisterKeister, B. D. (1996), Multidimensional quadrature algorithms, Computers in Physics, 10(20), 119-122. :\\\\left(\\\\frac 1{2\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{d/2} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^d}\\\\cos(\\\\x\\\\ )e^{-\\\\ x\\\\^2}\\\\,dx, where \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ denotes the Euclidean norm and d=25. Keister reports that using a standard numerical method some 220,000 points were needed to obtain a relative error on the order of 10^{-2}. A QMC calculation using the generalized Faure low discrepancy sequence (QMC-GF) used only 500 points to obtain the same relative error. The same integral was tested for a range of values of d up to d=100. Its error was : c\\\\cdot n^{-1}, c<110, where n is the number of evaluations of f. This may be compared with the MC method whose error was proportional to n^{-1/2}. These are empirical results. In a theoretical investigation PapageorgiouPapageorgiou, A. (2001), Fast convergence of quasi-Monte Carlo for a class of isotropic integrals, Math. Comp., 70, 297-306. proved that the convergence rate of QMC for a class of d-dimensional isotropic integrals which includes the integral defined above is of the order :\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}/n. This is with a worst case guarantee compared to the expected convergence rate of n^{-1/2} of Monte Carlo and shows the superiority of QMC for this type of integral. In another theoretical investigation PapageorgiouPapageorgiou, A. (2003), Sufficient conditions for fast quasi-Monte Carlo convergence, J. Complexity, 19(3), 332-351. presented sufficient conditions for fast QMC convergence. The conditions apply to isotropic and non-isotropic problems and, in particular, to a number of problems in computational finance. He presented classes of functions where even in the worst case the convergence rate of QMC is of order ::::n^{-1+p(\\\\log n)^{-1/2}}, where p\\\\ge 0 is a constant that depends on the class of functions. But this is only a sufficient condition and leaves open the major question we pose in the next section. Open questions # Characterize for which high-dimensional integration problems QMC is superior to MC. # Characterize types of financial instruments for which QMC is superior to MC.

Colombian geography presents formidable challenges to roadbuilders, needing to communicate its largest production centers deep inside the Andes with major ports in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. All of this carries a heavy premium to roadbuilding, compared with the cost of building highways in flat terrains. Therefore, the Colombian government is undertaking a great effort in order to improve the highway system, under the name of Fourth Generation Highways, with the intent of updating major roads to international safety and speed standards. This project will be funded through both public and private capital, with a total worth of nearly US$23 billion, accounting to a yearly investment of 3% of national GDP, improving or building a grand total of over 8.000 km of roads.http://www.ani.gov.co/sites/default/files/cuarta_generacion_de_concesiones_luis_fernando_andrade_moreno.pdf These roads are expected to improve Colombia's competitiveness in order to successfully take advantage of the many trade agreements signed in recent years.http://www.tlc.gov.co/publicaciones.php?id=5398 Highway safety in Colombia is enforced by the Highway Police, a unit of the National Police of Colombia. Colombia is crossed by the Pan-American Highway. Primary routes The main highways (with primary route numbers) include: = Western Trunk - National Route 25= Colombia is crossed by the Western Trunk highway (part of the Pan-American Highway) that connects to the south with Ecuador (where the highway is called the Sierra Trunk or Troncal de Sierra) and other South American countries. This international route connects to the national highway network on the Rumichaca Bridge in Nariño Department, which marks the international border between Colombia and Ecuador. From there and to the north, this road connects the cities of Pasto, Popayán, Cali, the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis (Eje Cafetero or \\"Coffee Region\\"), Anserma, Medellín, Sincelejo and Barranquilla, where it connects to the Caribbean Transverse highway. Difficulties arise in the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia as there are no connections by land in Colombia with Central America and the rest of North America. =Magdalena Trunk - National Route 45= The Magdalena Trunk crosses the section between the town of San Miguel, Putumayo at the border with Ecuador and the point known as Y de Ciénaga, a few kilometers from the city of Santa Marta on the Caribbean Sea. The road runs parallel to the Magdalena River, mainly on its right bank. This pathway allows the integration of central Colombia with the system of ports located on its Caribbean coast as well as the ports of Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta. =Caribbean Transverse - National Route 90= The Caribbean Transverse highway runs parallel to the Caribbean Sea coastline and joins the cities of Turbo (Antioquia) and Paraguachón (La Guajira), where it connects to the highway network in Venezuela. The highway connects the capital cities of this region: Montería, Sincelejo, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Riohacha. This route is also called Caribbean Trunk and connects to the Magdalena Trunk (National Route 45) in a place known as Y de Ciénaga, just 6 km from the town of Ciénaga (Magdalena) and the Western Trunk at two different points: in the municipality of Toluviejo (18 km from Sincelejo) and the city of Barranquilla. =Buenaventura Transverse - Puerto Carreño - National Route 40= The Buenaventura Transverse highway connects the country's largest port with the Venezuelan border in Puerto Carreño. Highway sections 06 (Bogotá - Villavicencio) and 07 (Villavicencio - Puerto López) are part of the Autopista al Llano (\\"Llano Tollway\\") section of the Buenaventura Transverse highway. = Central Trunk - National Route 45A= The Central Trunk highway connects the city of Bogotá with the departments of Boyacá and Santander. Major cities on this route include Zipaquirá, Chiquinquirá and Bucaramanga. The highway ends in the municipality of San Alberto, where it connects with the Magdalena Trunk highway (National Route 45). =North-Central Trunk - National Route 55= The North-Central Trunk highway begins in the village of La Caro in the town of Chía, connecting to Bogotá and Cundinamarca Department to the municipalities of Gachancipá, Tocancipá and Villapinzón. In Boyacá Department, the route changes to a north-south direction and later reaches Tunja, the capital of Boyacá Department. The highway continues through the towns of Paipa, Duitama and Soatá in Boyacá Department and Málaga in Santander Department. The highway terminates in Puerto Santander near the border with Venezuela. =Carretera Marginal de la Selva - National Route 65= Carretera Marginal de la Selva (\\"Jungle Border Highway\\") is an important South American route originally planned in 1963 to join the Amazon regions of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. In Colombia, this route begins at the San Miguel International Bridge (on the border with Ecuador) and follows the first stretch of the Magdalena Trunk highway to the municipality of Villa, where National Route 65 turns north toward the right side of the Cordillera Oriental mountains. The highway is scheduled to be extended to Saravena on the border with Venezuela; however, the section between Mina Blanca and La Uribe is not built yet, so the highway is currently divided into two sections. The southern section is also known as the Forest Trunk section and the northern section is known as the Llano Trunk section.

ICMA stated aims are to promote high standards of market practice, appropriate regulation, trade support, education and communication. It produces standard documentation for transactions such as equity and debt issuance and repos. ICMA market conventions and standards have been the pillars of the international debt market for almost 40 years, providing the self-regulatory framework of rules governing market practice which have facilitated the orderly functioning and impressive growth of the market.Official Website of the International Capital Market Association/ History The International Capital Market Association was formed in July 2005 from the merger of International Primary Market Association and the International Securities Market Association (formerly the Association of International Bond Dealers) to create an association that covered both primary and secondary international capital markets. The association has its roots in the creation of the Eurobond market in the early 1960s. Eurobonds created a new market in borrowing in US dollars offshore to avoid US tax regulations, but this itself introduced new problems with settlement and regulation across different jurisdictions. In response a group of bond dealers representing banks and securities firms established the Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) in 1969. In the years that followed, AIBD enacted a series of rules and recommendations governing market practice, providing stability and order to the international capital market. In the 1980s AIBD began to provide data services to the market and in 1989 launched the transaction matching, confirmation and regulatory reporting system, known as TRAX. In 1992 AIBD changed its name to International Securities Market Association (ISMA). Separately the International Primary Market Association (IPMA) was founded in 1984 by a number of major banks to provide basic recommendations for the primary capital market. In April 2009, ICMA sold its market services business, including TRAX, to Euroclear. In October 2014, the ICMA published the ICMA Private Wealth Management Charter of Quality, a self-regulatory document for wealth managers summing up best best practice adopted in the cross-border private banking industry. The Charter is consistent with regulation at EU and national level, complementing industry standards such as the Wolfsberg Principles on anti-money laundering. This is the first time that the private wealth management industry has joined together voluntarily to commit to common standards of quality, compliance and good market practice as set out in the Charter. The charter's is organised around the following 3 main principles: \\\\- Integrity: in business relationships; of markets, financial products and services; and of staff; \\\\- Transparency: towards clients, and regarding the regulatory environment; \\\\- Professionalism: regarding the primacy of clients’ legitimate interests and efficiency. Education Since the inception of its European Seminar in 1974, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) has been committed to providing high quality ICMA Executive Education to its members and to the market at large. The establishment by the Association of the ICMA Centre at The University of Reading in 1991, and its subsequent financial support, has succeeded in creating an institution which is setting the standards in the application of information technology to financial markets education.

It covered Carleton County and the upper Saint John River valley and was owned by local entrepreneur Dwight Fraser and its publisher was Ken Langdon. The first weekly edition was released on October 31, 2007 and it last edition was released on October 28, 2008. The paper was available free of charge until December 31, 2007. The price of its final edition was $1.25 per issue. The paper ceased publication allegedly due to 'unfair competition' by its competitor Brunswick News publication the Bugle-Observer which was selling at $.25 an issue through the use of coupons. Controversy One of the co-owners of the Carleton Free Press and its publisher, Ken Langdon, was a former publisher of the competing Bugle-Observer. Langdon's departure from his position at the Bugle-Observer was the focus of a controversial court action by his former employer Brunswick News which has accused him of holding information that might unfairly benefit the Carleton Free Press. The battle over the Carleton Free Press started on September 27, 2007, when a team of four forensic accountants hired by CanadaEast News Inc., a media holding company owned by industrial conglomerate J.D. Irving Limited, barged into Langdon's home in Woodstock with a search warrant. The search by the forensic accountants was authorized under a rarely used power of the civil courts relating to industrial espionage, commonly called an Anton Piller order, coupled with an injunction.Brunswick News Inc. v. Langdon, 2007 NBQB 424, para 15. \\"They even rooted through my wife's lingerie drawer,\\" Langdon said. Days before the search, citing a poor relationship with his immediate supervisor, Langdon had resigned his post after four years as publisher of the Bugle-Observer, a paper owned by Brunswick News. In his resignation letter, Langdon expressed his intent to start a new paper. \\"During my last weeks in the employ of the Irvings, I consulted with a lawyer who advised me that I had grounds for a constructive dismissal suit,\\" wrote Langdon in the Carleton Free Press' first editorial. \\"Subsequently I sent to my home files that I could use as part of that suit.\\" The Irvings allege those files contained confidential commercial information. They were able to secure a court injunction to search Langdon's home while attempting to block the publication of the Carleton Free Press. Langdon was exonerated by a New Brunswick court on all charges. On November 2, 2007, Justice Peter Glennie of the province's top court blocked the Irvings' request to halt the publication the Carleton Free Press, while prohibiting Langdon from using confidential Brunswick News information. \\"In this province, the Irvings are connected to their monopoly in the forestry sector,\\" Jeannot Volpe, leader of New Brunswick's Conservative Party, the official opposition, told IPS. \\"I've been to events concerning this sector with hundreds of people which no one from the Irving papers covered. People are starting to get frustrated: how is our voice going to be heard if the media won't report the message?\\" said Volpe, whose party normally takes the side of big business. While media rights activists are hopeful about the Carleton Free Press, Irving still dominates the province's public sphere. The company has big plans in the works, including a seven-billion-billion dollar oil refinery and a new liquefied natural gas facility and pipeline in the city of Saint John. These mega-projects have raised the ire of environmentalists who say the province should be decreasing rather than increasing its production of greenhouse gases. \\"There is no credible reporting by anyone who understands the science behind these proposals,\\" said Inka Milewski, science advisor to the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. \\"There is no credible capacity of any Irving media outlets to cover these stories,\\" Milewski told IPS. \\"Media concentration is worse in Canada than in other industrialised countries -- and in New Brunswick, way worse,\\" Robert Picard, a U.S. media economics expert, told a 2003 conference in Moncton, New Brunswick. Similar tactics used by Brunswick News HERE, a tabloid style weekly magazine, was New Brunswick's sole independent English language publication up until 2004, when the Irvings opened a competing \\"alternative\\" weekly called the Metro Marquee. While HERE had been publishing successfully for four years, the independent publication couldn't compete with the ad rates of the new Irving competitor and HERE's owners were forced to sell out to the monopoly rather than face financial ruin. The Irvings closed down the Metro Marquee upon purchasing HERE and changed the paper from a staff-driven organisation to a freelance model, with most writers receiving 25 dollars per article and 10 dollars per photo. On October 18, HERE, an Irving owned weekly which bills itself as \\"New Brunswick's Urban Voice\\", ran a cover story titled \\"Why not choose natural gas?\\" HERE normally requires its cover stories to be at least 1,000 words; the natural gas cover clocked in at 302. The article, which reads like a press release from a natural gas company, ran without listing its author, which also violates the magazine's normal guidelines.

It encompassed northern and eastern Gaul, that is, modern France north and east of the Loire, including the Low Countries and modern Germany west of the Rhine. The diocese comprised the following provinces: Gallia Lugdunensis I, Gallia Lugdunensis II, Gallia Lugdunensis III, Gallia Lugdunensis IV (Senonia), Belgica I, Belgica II, Germania I, Germania II, Alpes Poenninae et Graiae and Maxima Sequanorum.  History  The diocese was established after the reforms of Diocletian and Constantine I in c. 314. In the year 407, the Rhine frontier was breached, and much of Gaul lost to barbarian tribes temporarily. Roman control over most of Gaul and the Rhineland was restored until the death of Valentinian III in 455. The territory remaining in Roman hands after the 450s was in the south in the Auvergne and Provence until ceded in 475 and in the northwest, the so-called \\"Domain of Soissons\\". After its fall to the Franks in 486 and the end of Roman administration in northern Gaul, the diocese can be said to have de facto ended.  Bibliography  *P. Heather, La caduta dell'Impero romano.

Aircraft with a MTOW rating between 7 t and 136 t are considered medium, and aircraft with a MTOW rating less than 7 t are considered light. In the US, the FAA uses a slightly different categorization, adding a block between medium and heavy, labeling aircraft capable of maximum takeoff weights more than and less than as large.FAA Notice N JO 7110.525 All aircraft produce wingtip vortices that create wake turbulence in flight. The vortex strength increases when the aircraft is heavier and when it flies slowly. Thus, the term \\"heavy\\" (unlike light, medium and large) is included by heavy-class aircraft in radio transmissions around airports during take-off and landing, incorporated into the call sign, to warn other aircraft that they should leave additional separation to avoid this wake turbulence. All wide-body aircraft are classified as Heavy, with the exception of the first two Airbus A300s produced (the A300B1, MTOW of “only” , both shorter and lighter than the mass-production A300s), while the Airbus A380 (MTOW of ) and the single Antonov An-225 (MTOW of ) are classified in the even larger category of super. Certain variants of the narrow-bodied Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were considered \\"heavy\\" based on MTOW. Of special note here is the narrow-bodied Boeing 757. Under current guidance, the 757 is considered large, having a MTOW of only . However, after a number of accidents where smaller aircraft following closely behind a 757 crashed, the rules were changed so that controllers are required to apply the special wake turbulence separation criteria specified in paragraph 5-5-4 in the FAA guidelines for aircraft separation, as though the 757 were heavy.

Origins Historical flag of Fine Gael In the face of intimidation of Cumann na nGaedheal meetings by the anti-treaty IRA and the rise in support for Éamon de Valera's Fianna Fáil from 1926, a new strategy was required to strengthen the voice of the pro-Treaty tradition who found themselves in opposition. The National Guard, popularly known as the Blueshirts, and originally the Army Comrades Association, a nationalist- conservative and covertly fascist movement led by Eoin O'Duffy, took up the task of defending Cumann na nGaedheal rallies from republican intimidation. When they planned a march on Dublin, de Valera banned the demonstration, fearing a repeat of Mussolini's infamous March on Rome. As a result, Fine Gael-The United Ireland Party was founded as an independent party on 8 September 1933, following a merger of Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the National Guard. The merger brought together two strands of Irish nationalism namely the pro-treaty wing of revolutionary Sinn Féin and the old Home Rule party represented by Dillon and the Centre Party. In reality, the new party was a larger version of Cumann na nGaedheal, the party created in 1923 by the Pro-Treaty leaders of the Irish Free State under WT Cosgrave. The new party sought to end the Economic War, improve relations with Britain while advocating a United Ireland within the framework of the Commonwealth. After a short hiatus under the disastrous leadership of General Eoin O'Duffy, Cosgrave returned to lead the new party, continuing in the leadership until 1944. During this time, the party reverted to what it had been like during the days of Cumann na nGaedheal, much to the disappointment of those who had advocated a merger on the basis of creating a better organised party machine. Although the people who formed the party had been in government for ten years in the Irish Free State (1922–32), once Fianna Fáil under Éamon de Valera came to power in 1932, Fine Gael spent the next sixteen years in the doldrums, overshadowed by the larger party. Indeed, at times, it went into what was thought to be terminal decline on the opposition benches. Cosgrave finally resigned as leader in 1944 and was replaced by General Richard Mulcahy The party's fortunes seemed to be on the rise as the new leader sought to cast away the legacy of a weak party organisation that Cosgrave had bequeathed to Fine Gael. By the time the 1948 election was called, a number of first time candidates had been selected, with four of these subsequently elected as TDs. Inter-party governments When the votes were counted in the 1948 general election, Fine Gael had 31 seats. While not disastrous given the number of young candidates returned and that the purely party vote had been retained despite the loss of key personalities, it was still a result that showed little promise for the future. However, Fianna Fáil had not won an overall majority. Nevertheless, it appeared that no other party could possibly form a government, as Fianna Fáil still had 30 more seats than Fine Gael. The situation changed when the anti-Fianna Fáil parties realised that if they banded together, they had only one seat fewer than Fianna Fáil, and would be able to take power with the support of at least seven independents. However, some of the other parties in the prospective coalition considered Mulcahy, to be too controversial a potential Taoiseach. Notably, Clann na Poblachta (under former anti-Treaty IRA chief of staff, Sean MacBride), were opposed to him because of his role as Chief of Staff of the Irish Army in the execution of republicans during the Irish Civil War. Mulcahy selflessly stepped aside and former Attorney-General John A. Costello was chosen to head the First Inter- Party Government, which lasted from 1948 to 1951. Costello was an effective chairman of a coalition comprising many different shades of opinion. That Government is remembered for establishing the Industrial Development Authority and the formal declaration of a republic in 1949. Also a record number of houses were built, improvements were made in the tourism industry and the health minister Noel Browne successfully tackled the tuberculosis disease. Costello also headed the Second Inter-Party Government, which had a much stronger Fine Gael representation, from 1954 to 1957. Fine Gael's Foreign Minister Liam Cosgrave negotiated Ireland's entry to the United Nations in 1955 and, in doing so, defined Irish foreign policy for decades. The party's Health Minister Tom O'Higgins introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI) and thus established Ireland's partly insurance-based health service that persists today. Fianna Fáil and de Valera were returned to power in 1957, banishing Fine Gael once more to the opposition benches. Costello's Government, although it decided against the re-introduction of internment, responded to the activities of Saor Uladh and the mainstream IRA by stepping up security measures against these groups, leading to the arrest of prominent republicans. In response to this and to a rapid deterioration in the state of the economy, Clann na Poblachta withdrew its support and Costello was left with no choice other than to call an election.Maguire, John Internment, the IRA and the Lawless Case in Ireland: 1957–61 Journal of the Oxford University History Society, 2 (Michelmas 2004) pp 2–4 (Last visited, 14 July 2006) The Just Society and Tom O'Higgins Out of government, Fine Gael again went into decline. In the mid-1960s, however, it launched a new policy statement, known as The Just Society, advocating policies based on principles of social justice and equality. That document was the brainchild of Declan Costello, a Fine Gael TD and son of former Taoiseach John A. Costello, and reflected an emerging faction in the party that was being influenced by Social Democracy. This new strand of thinking in Fine Gael paved the way for the rise within the party of liberal thinkers such as Garret FitzGerald. Party leaders of the time remained conservative but the seeds of the 1980s revolution had been sown. In 1966, Fine Gael's young presidential candidate, Tom O'Higgins, came within 1% of defeating the apparently unbeatable sitting president, Éamon de Valera, in that year's presidential election. This was regarded as a substantial achievement as Fianna Fáil had persuaded RTÉ to provide no coverage of the campaign and the election was held in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising in which de Valera had played a prominent role. O'Higgins came from the emerging social democratic wing of the party. When James Dillon resigned as Fine Gael leader in 1965, Liam Cosgrave (the son of Cumann na nGaedheal founder WT Cosgrave) was chosen to replace him. The swift changeover was viewed as a means of keeping control of the party away from the emerging centre-left wing. However, the party's two factions continued to feud. With events in Northern Ireland spiralling out of control, Liam Cosgrave sought to focus Fine Gael minds on its role as protector of the state's institutions. At the Fine gael Ard Fheis in May 1972, the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the state, Cosgrave rounded on his enemies. He ridiculed liberals in the party who were distracting his efforts to bring about a settlement in the North. His speech memorably likened his critics to \\"mongrel foxes\\" that had gone to ground. In the wake of the Fianna Fáil Arms Crisis and Cosgrave's strong performances in opposition in defending the institutions of the State, the party was well-positioned to return to Government with the Labour Party (which had altered its 1960s anti-coalition stance). National Coalition After a break of sixteen years, Fine Gael returned to power in 1973, at the head of a National Coalition government with Labour, under Cosgrave's leadership, on the basis of a pre-election agreement between the two parties and active encouragement of each party's supporters to record preferences for the other party's candidates. That government has generally been regarded as a well- meaning government containing much political talent, but was hit by frequent problems. Some of these were outside its control (for example the 1970s oil crisis and escalating violence in Northern Ireland), while others were its own direct creation notably the public criticism on President Cearbhall Ó Dalaigh, by Minister for Defence, Patrick Donegan, in which the latter referred to the President as a \\"thundering disgrace\\". (Some witnesses to the speech recall the Minister as having employed a more forceful and colloquial adjective than \\"thundering.\\") President Ó Dálaigh's subsequent resignation in 1976, in response to Cosgrave's refusal to discipline his unruly subordinate, severely damaged the National Coalition's reputation. President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, who resigned following a clash with a Fine Gael minister Cosgrave, like his father before him, showed a fierce determination to defend the institutions of state and would not compromise with extremists, instead working towards reconciliation. The National Coalition is noted for its attempts to build a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland through the Sunningdale Agreement. The Sunningdale Agreement collapsed after a loyalist general strike. However, it left a legacy of compromise that would lead to later Agreements aimed at bringing peace to the troubled region. The government's record in the area of civil liberties is more mixed, with allegations that an official blind eye was turned to the abuse in custody of republican suspects by a so-called \\"Heavy Gang\\" within the Garda Síochána, or police force. It was the Coalition's failure to address the economic problems of the day, however, with inflation, unemployment and national indebtedness all running at record levels, that led to its ultimate repudiation by the voters. In 1977 the Fine Gael/Labour government suffered a heavy defeat, with Fianna Fáil winning an unprecedented 20-seat majority in the 148-seat Dáil, a landslide under proportional representation. Garret FitzGerald Cosgrave resigned the leadership and was replaced by Garret FitzGerald. FitzGerald had been a successful Minister for Foreign Affairs in the National Coalition, his affable style and liberal views doing much to change the stereotypical European view of Ireland (and perhaps Ireland's of itself). FitzGerald was one of Ireland's most popular politicians and son of Desmond FitzGerald, a Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for External Affairs. He moved Fine Gael leftwards to the centre ground and promoted the so-called Liberal Agenda. He also founded the autonomous youth movement Young Fine Gael, while the party attracted thousands of new members. Fine Gael seemed trendy under FitzGerald's leadership (for instance, U2 endorsed them at this time). Fine Gael's revitalisation was on such a scale that by the November 1982 general election, Fine Gael was only five seats behind Fianna Fáil in Dáil Éireann and bigger than its rival in the Oireachtas as a whole (i.e. counting the number of representatives in both houses of parliament). As Taoiseach, FitzGerald attempted to create a more pluralist Republic. In 1985 after lengthy negotiations he succeeded in negotiating the Anglo-Irish Agreement. This gave the Republic a say in the affairs of Northern Ireland while improving the Anglo-Irish relationship. Nevertheless, Fine Gael under Fitzgerald failed to control spiralling emigration and unemployment, though the intransigence of Labour leader Dick Spring with regard to taxation and public spending did not help. FitzGerald headed three governments: 1981 - February 1982, 1982 - 1987, and a short-lived Fine Gael minority government when Labour withdrew from the previous coalition as tensions had developed between the coalition partners over how to tackle the economy. In 1987 the party was defeated heavily in the general election of that year. FitzGerald resigned and his close ally and former Minister for Finance Alan Dukes replaced him, but continued to lead the party in the same socially democratic vein. Rainbow Coalition From a highpoint in the 1980s, Fine Gael went into slight, then sharp decline. Despite Dukes launching the Tallaght Strategy in 1987, the party gained just four seats in the following general election. In 1990, its candidate in the Irish presidential election, Austin Currie, was pushed into a humiliating third place, behind the winner, Labour's Mary Robinson and Fianna Fáil's Brian Lenihan. This led to John Bruton replacing Alan Dukes as the party's leader. In 1989, political history was made when Fianna Fáil abandoned one of its \\"core principles\\", its opposition to coalition. Having failed in 1987 and 1989 to win outright majorities, Fianna Fáil entered into a coalition administration with the Progressive Democrats. Commentators predicted that that would leave Fine Gael isolated, with Fianna Fáil able to swap coalition partners to keep itself continuously in power. This was also precipitated by the fact that now, under its new pact with the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil would now be able to, though remaining quite ideologically populist, dominate the fiscally conservative, right of centre vacuum previously dominated by Fine Gael. The rise of the Progressive Democrats diminished Fine Gael's chances of continuing to promote the Fitzgerald-ite liberal agenda alongside its more traditional, right wing economic conservatism. This phenomenon indeed became even more apparent when, after the 1992 general election, Fianna Fáil replaced the Progressive Democrats with the Labour Party in coalition. However the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition disintegrated in 1994, allowing Bruton to emerge as Taoiseach of a three-party Rainbow Coalition, involving Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left. This was in spite of a pre-election promise in 1992 from Bruton that Fine Gael would not enter government with the Democratic Left, a party which had links to militant Irish republicanism, as well as being left leaning in its outlook. This Government's first policy initiative was the introduction of divorce which was ratified in a referendum by a narrow majority. John Bruton gained respect for his leadership during the campaign. The Government also oversaw the first period of unprecedented economic growth, job creation on a massive scale and Ireland's first budget surplus in over twenty five years. The Irish economy continued to thrive under Fine Gael and Labour with the introduction of the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and a modest cut in income tax. However, the Provisional IRA ceasefire ended in 1996, stalling the peace process. Many nationalists blamed the approach taken by Taoiseach John Bruton for this setback. The three parties worked well together and fought the 1997 election on a united platform. However, despite positive opinion polls throughout its time in office, the Government was narrowly defeated in the 1997 general election. Fine Gael gained nine seats but Labour lost heavily and the Rainbow Coalition was replaced by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition under Bertie Ahern. 2002 meltdown The party had little answer as popular Taoiseach Bertie Ahern cemented his title as the Teflon Taoiseach (a reference to his uncanny ability to emerge unscathed from controversy after controversy). The party, facing a hostile media and criticism of Bruton's style of leadership, ditched him in 2001 in place of what was seen as the dream ticket of former Minister Michael Noonan for leader and former minister Jim Mitchell for deputy leader. However the dream proved to be a nightmare, as Fine Gael suffered its worst-ever election result in the 2002 general election, declining from 54 TDs to 31. Many of its best TDs, including most of its front bench, in particular Deputy Leader Jim Mitchell, lost their seats. Noonan resigned on the night of the election result, and was replaced by former Trade and Tourism Minister Enda Kenny in the subsequent leadership election. With the scale of the collapse, questions were asked as to whether the party had a future. Recovery under Enda Kenny Under its new leader, Enda Kenny, Fine Gael staged a recovery in local and European elections held on 11 June 2004, becoming the largest Irish party in the European Parliament by winning five seats (compared to just four seats for the ruling Fianna Fáil party), while it came within nine seats of becoming the largest party in local government. The recovery for Fine Gael was complete when it gained 20 seats at the 2007 general election. The party entered into an electoral alliance with the Labour Party in Mullingar during 2005, the \\"Alliance For Change\\". This election, however, did not bring Fine Gael back into power. In the local elections of 2009, Fine Gael surpassed Fiannna Fáil, gaining over 40 seats and bringing the total up to 340 compared to Fianna Fáil's 180. At European level, Fine Gael was the largest party and won the Dublin South by-election with George Lee sweeping to victory with over 54% of the vote and just missing out on a seat in Dublin Central with Paschal Donohoe, although Lee later resigned from his position after only nine months due to having \\"virtually no influence or input\\" into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies. In 2010, opinion polls had Labour ahead of Fine Gael with Fianna Fáil's collapse in the votes not transferring to Fine Gael. Deputy Leader Richard Bruton along with nine of the Fine Gael Front Bench challenged Enda Kenny for the leadership. In a bitter battle, Enda Kenny won the confidence vote of the party and set about healing the wounds. He reappointed Richard Bruton to the Front Bench along with bringing Michael Noonan back into the Front Bench as Spokesman on Finance. The arrival of the IMF to bail out the country's finances in November of that year saw Fianna Fáil implode. Fine Gael, with strong performances from Noonan and his team of deputies, saw Fine Gael support rise heading into the general election which was called in February 2011. Many believed Enda Kenny had a terrific campaign and the question was now whether Fine Gael could get an overall majority. When the votes were counted Fine Gael fell short with an historic seat total of 76 seats and 36.1% of the vote, becoming the largest party in the Dáil for the first time. The Fianna Fáil vote collapsed to 17.4% and 20 seats in the Dáil, compared to 41.6% and 77 seats at the previous general election. A new government was formed with the Labour Party under the leadership of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. He had led the party from the abyss to the greatest victory in their history and now had the largest party in the state. In July 2013 five TDs (Lucinda Creighton, Terence Flanagan, Peter Mathews, Billy Timmins and Brian Walsh) and two senators (Paul Bradford and Fidelma Healy Eames) were expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party for opposing the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition's Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013. In September 2013 they founded the Reform Alliance along with Denis Naughten, another Fine Gael TD who had been expelled for opposing the 2011 budget's downgrade of Roscommon County Hospital. Brian Walsh declined to join the bloc. Creighton had the highest profile of the founders, having been Minister of State for European Affairs prior to her expulsion. She denied being the leader of the new group.

It encompassed southern and western Gaul (Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis), that is, modern France south and west of the Loire, including Provence. The diocese comprised the following provinces: Aquitanica I, Aquitanica II, Novempopulana (Aquitanica III), Narbonensis I, Narbonensis II, Viennensis and Alpes Maritimae.  History  The diocese was established during the reforms of Diocletian who reigned from 284-305. It is attested early in the reign of Constantine I in the Verona List which has been dated to around 314. In 402 an annual provincial assembly, the Concilium septem provinciarum, was established in Arles. In 407, the Vandals and their allies invaded Gaul, devastating the region until they departed for the Iberian peninsula in 409. The Visigoths were brought in as foederati to aid the Romans against them, and in 418 emperor Honorius allowed them to settle in Aquitania around Toulouse. Although nominally Roman subjects, the Goths were practically independent, a fact which was formally recognized by the Western Empire in 475, just one year before its end. In 462 Ricimer ceded them also the province of Narbonensis Prima, while the Goths proceeded to occupy the remaining provinces east of the Rhone in 477. Henceforth, the lands that had comprised the diocese of the Seven Provinces became part of the Visigothic Kingdom. Aquitania was soon lost to the Franks, with only the southern coastal strip (Septimania) retained by the Goths.

(2018, March 01). Retrieved from http://www.escapeartist.com/colombia/travel/folkloric-dance-in-colombia/ Its name comes from the Cathorops mapale (fish) when they are out of the water. The dance moves are compared with the agility and strength of those who are performing it. From the clothing to the precise moves of the hips and shoulders, the Mapalé is deemed to be very sexual. The body movements during the dance are swiftly made to follow the beating of the drums and represent the fish out of the water (men), while the women are the sea.  History  The Mapalé was born as a song and dance of fishermen's work and how it was performed. They would do this to enjoy the night after finishing their work day. It emerged on the Colombian Caribbean coast, thanks to the cultural influence of Africans trafficked like slaves, who mainly came from Angola. When they managed to flee from their captors they founded quilombos or communities in remote places like Palenque de San Basilio, where they affirmed their cultural heritage. Born in the Caribbean, it was introduced in ancient times along the banks of the Magdalena River. At the moment, it is also danced in Afro-Colombian communities of the Pacific From Colombia to Panama all the way down to Peru, including Ecuador. In its origins the dance of labor was performed at night and accompanied by touches of the yamaró and quitambre drums, the palms of the hands, and singing. Subsequently, there was a transformation of its theme attributing an emphasis of sexual rejoicing and assigning the frenetic evolution that is present today. The current choreography consists of traits from its African essence, both in the costumes which is extremely simple, and in the machete (a work tool used for the fishing process). There are some widespread definitions, some of which indicate that the rhythm comes from a festival because of the abundance of the fish. The Mapalé has strong movements for which you must have good body management and discipline.  Clothing  Men's wardrobe: They wear trousers that reach the heels, sometimes adorned with fringes or washers in the mouth of the leg. The costumes, both for men and for women, go according to the dance and may vary from one group to another. Women's wardrobe: Usually in black, women wear short skirts with fringes, raffias or small ruffles that adorn the accelerated movement of their hips. They wear flat shoes or go barefoot and wear turbans of flags on their heads.  Dance  The Mapalé couples dance loose or stuck alternately and it is danced with short steps, very fast rhythm and with constant clapping of the dancers. The cumbia music starts, and the routine begins with forming two rows, one in front of the other and in a confrontation between man and woman to make forward and backward advances. This continues with free and individual exhibition positions of the men with the purpose of pleasing their partners, who take turns responding to the confrontations. The movements are frenetic and with a high content of eroticism. Those of the women are different and express themselves more exciting and erotic. The dancers move quickly and forcefully, jumping, falling, raising their arms, shaking their shoulders and hips, following the rhythm of the drums.

The office aims to provide an international liaison service to prevent peacetime submarine accidents, and to quickly respond on a global basis if they do occur. It consists of an international team of submarine escape and rescue experts based at Northwood, UK. The aim of ISMERLO is to establish endorsed procedures as the international standard for submarine escape and rescue using consultation and consensus among submarine-operating nations. Advice on training and procurement as well as an inspection and monitoring service is also offered. The organization provides online information about Submarine Escape and Rescue (SMER) and aims to enable the rapid call out of international rescue systems in the event of a submarine accident. The Submarine Escape and Rescue Working Group (SMERWG) covers technical and procedural issues, and aims to share information and define mutually accepted standards for design and operation of SMER systems.

The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges.

Most releases appear both on CDs and as limited vinyl editions. Furthermore, the label sells merchandising articles such as T-shirts and embroidered patches. The label's most well-known bands are Inquisition, Graveland and Nargaroth. No Colours has also released many of Rob Darken's side projects such as Lord Wind and Infernum. Besides neo-nazi bands such as Thor's Hammer from Poland, the label has also signed many apolitical bands like Wigrid and Suicidal Winds, so some are against an association to the far right.

The British colonial office in India and Ceylon restricted the Americans to the relatively small Jaffna Peninsula for geopolitical reasons for almost 40 years. The critical period of the impact of the missionaries was from the 1820s to early 20th century. During this time, they engaged in original translations from English to Tamil, printing, and publishing, establishing primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions and providing health care for residents of the Jaffna Peninsula. These activities resulted in many social changes amongst Sri Lankan Tamils that survive even today. They also led to the attainment of a lopsided literacy level among residents in the relatively small peninsula that is cited by scholars as one of the primary factors contributing to the recently ended civil war. Many notable educational and health institutions within the Jaffna Peninsula owe their origins to the missionary activists from America. Missionaries also courted controversy by publishing negative information about local religious practices and rituals.  Background information  Location of Sri Lanka, a small island nation, in the Indian Ocean The minority Sri Lankan Tamil-dominated Jaffna Peninsula ruled by the Jaffna Kingdom, which is hardly , came under the direct jurisdiction of colonial power from Europe after the 1591 demise of Puviraja Pandaram, a local king, at the hands of the Portuguese. He had led a rebellion against Portuguese influence and was defeated. After establishing their rule through kings who were nominally Catholic, the Portuguese encouraged and coerced conversion of the locals to the Catholic faith. After the defeat and death of the last king Cankili II in 1619, most prominent Hindu temples were razed to the ground and restrictions on observance of native religious rituals were instituted.Abeysinghe, Jaffna under the Portuguese, p.9,10,34Gunasingam,Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism ,p.68Abeysinghe, T. Jaffna Under the Portuguese, pp. 58–63. The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company in 1658. During the Duct colonial period the popular Nallur Kandaswamy temple was rebuilt during the 1750s. This was also a period of revival of local literary activity. Local laws such as Thesavalamai were codified during this period, and the history of the previous Jaffna Kingdom under the name of Yalpana Vaipava Malai was put to print. The Dutch were replaced by the British in 1796. Although the British did not officially espouse any policy regarding religious conversions, they encouraged missionary activities in the Maritime Provinces except in the interior erstwhile Kandyan kingdom, where they had agreed to maintain the local Buddhist religion as part of the 1815 takeover of the kingdom.de Silva, Religion and Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Sri Lanka, p.114 For geopolitical reasons, the British saw fit to restrict the American missionaries to the Jaffna Peninsula. There were many denominations present such as the Methodist, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians whereas the British missionaries of the Methodist, Baptist and Anglican sects were present in the rest of the island. Even when this restriction was removed, the initial divisions between North Ceylon and South Ceylon missions were maintained.(see Wesleyan Methodist Mission, North Ceylon) By the early 19th century there were nine mission stations within the small peninsula.de Silva, Religion and Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Sri Lanka, p.115  The American involvement  Rev. Samuel Newell (died March 30, 1841), founder of the ACM in Jaffna The seeds for the American involvement in Jaffna were laid by The Rev. Samuel Newell in 1813. He and his wife Harriet Newell were sent out by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mission in India in 1813. As it was just after the Anglo-American war of 1812, the suspicious British authorities in Calcutta asked them to leave. The Newells were then asked to go to Mauritius but Samuel Newell lost his only child and wife in Mauritius. From there he left for British-held Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. He landed in Galle and ended up in Jaffna city. Although he spent most of his career in India, particularly Bombay he was instrumental in starting up the American missionary involvement in Jaffna. He was followed by other missionary families such as Rev. Edward Warren, who arrived in July 1816. He took special interest in educating the people of the area in both English and their native Tamil language. He started the first American missionary school in Tellipalai in 1816. By 1848, 105 Tamil schools and sixteen English schools were founded. Mission centers were soon opened in nine locations.Hudson, Religious Controversy in British India: Dialogues in South Asian Languages, p.#29 Other New Englanders also took important steps to provide educational opportunities for women. Harriet Winslow, a great-great- grandmother of the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, founded the Uduvil Girls' School in 1824, the first Girls’ boarding school in Asia.Eliza Agnew from Pennsylvania was a teacher there for 42 years. Missionaries also made efforts to provide collegiate level education by founding the Batticota Seminary at Vaddukoddai in 1823 with Rev. Dr. Daniel Poor as its first principal. The American Mission started the first printing press in Jaffna in 1820 and, in 1841, the island's second oldest newspaper.– Morning Star – and the first Tamil-language newspaper, Utayatarakai. In 1862, Rev. Miron Winslow published a Comprehensive Tamil-English Dictionary. ACM also provided medical missionaries starting in 1820. The first medical center was managed by Dr. John Scudder. He founded what is considered to be the first Western Medical Mission in Asia at Panditeripo in Jaffna District. He served there for nineteen years in the dual capacity of clergyman and physician. His most important service was the establishment of a large hospital, of which he was physician in chief. He was especially successful in the treatment of cholera and yellow fever. He also founded several native schools and churches.Waterbury, Jared Bell (1870) Memoir of the Rev. John Scudder, M.D.: Thirty-six Years Missionary in India, Harper & Brothers, Franklin Square, New York, retrieved 7/19/2007 full text He and his wife Harriet had 6 surviving sons and 2 daughters who all became medical missionaries and worked in South India.A Manual of the Reformed Church in America (formerly Ref. Prot.

By the 1850s, he had translated more than 1,000 pages of medical texts into Tamil. He founded in Manipai what later became Green Memorial Hospital. This fledgling hospital was also used to train more than 60 locals in western medicine as fully fledged doctors. Of the first batch of 10 students only two by the name of Evarts and Ira Gould passed successfully. It was Sri Lanka’s first medical school as well as the only school until the present day to teach medicine in a local language.Ambihaipahar, Scientific Tamil Pioneer, p.25, p.29, p.62  The Batticotta experience  The relatively small (15 × 40 miles) Jaffna Peninsula in pink with adjoining islands, as compared to rest of Sri LankaBatticotta Seminary was founded as a seminary for the best students from all other seminaries across the peninsula. It was intended to provide a tertiary level education equivalent a College in New England. The pioneering missionary at the Batticotta Seminary was Rev. Dr. Daniel Poor. Under him the American congregational missionaries became the pioneers of formal English and Tamil education in northern Sri Lanka. Although the initial aim was to convert Hindus to Christianity, it came to impart Biblical, English and European sciences on par with New England community colleges.ABCFM Report on the Deputation to India, p.77 The seminary undertook to research and published pioneering books in the Tamil language in local literature, logic, algebra, astronomy and general science. One of the prominent alumni was C. W. Thamotharampillai, who was also the first graduate (1857) of the University of Madras in India. Sir Emerson Tennent judged the Batticotta Seminary equal in rank with many a European university. The late Rev. Dr. Sabapathy Kulendran, the first bishop of the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India (JDCSI) observed that the \\"seminary brought about a tremendous upsurge the like of which has never been seen in the country before or after.\\" Eventually, due to financial reasons, the seminary began to collect an entrance fee; thus, only wealthy families were able to send their children for education. The primary purpose of these families was to assure that their children received a European standard education without converting to Christianity. Thus, a missionary by the name of Rufus Anderson decided that the seminary should be shut down and it was closed in 1855. This led to a seventeen-year struggle by local Christians to reopen the seminary. It eventually opened as Jaffna College. Although American involvement continues to the current day in missionary activities, the critical age of transformation ended with the turn of the 20th century.  Social impact  Although the missionaries came primarily to convert the locals, in the process they bequeathed all the modern intellectual necessities for a nation. According to N. Sabaratnam a prominent editor of Eelanadu newspaper, With the amalgamation of North Ceylon Missions into the Church of South India (CSI), most properties and existing educational institutions are managed by the CSI.Ambihaipahar, Scientific Tamil Pioneer, p.09 Their intrusion into Jaffna also had other unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by Arumuga Navalar, who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics too started their own schools as a countermeasure. The state also had its share of primary and secondary schools. Thus saturated with educational opportunities, many Tamils became literate. This was used by the British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, Malaysia and Singapore. By the time Sri Lanka became independent in 1948, about 60% of government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed hardly 15% of the population. The popularly elected leaders of the country saw it as an outcome of a strategy by the British to control the majority Sinhalese that needed to be redressed. These measures deteriorated the already frail political relationship between the communities and many experts believe it as one of the main causes of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Ambihaipahar, Scientific Tamil Pioneer, p.29 = Controversy = The primary responsibility of the missionaries was to convert as many people as possible. They used education and medical missionary work to assist them. But they also published ridiculing and insulting material on native religion and practices. The popular deity Lord Murugan was specifically targeted. This started the backlash against Christian missionaries. Many early converts like C. W. Thamotharampillai and Carol Visvanathapillai came back to Hinduism. This also resulted in formation of many Hindu Schools and more political awareness for native Tamils. Today around 10% are Christians with Catholics forming 90% of the Christians in Sri Lanka.de Silva, Religion and Nationalism in Nineteenth Century Sri Lanka, p.117  See also  *Diocese of Jaffna *Protestants in Sri Lanka  Notes   References     External links  * *Historical pictures of American missions in Ceylon *Church of South India – Jaffna Diocese *150 years of Udupiddy American Mission College *Relief organization for tsunami victims *American Ambassadors: W.

Under his presidency, the Mestalla club lived a sporting career marked by the Cup title in 1979 and the Cup Winners Cup title in 1980, although from the economic point of view, Valencia started to get into debt mainly due to the redesigning works in Mestalla so that it could be ready for the World Cup in 1982, and the acquisition and works of the \\"Ciudad Deportiva del Valencia CF\\". That economic effort proved to be an economic success in the long run, and an asset that the club is still benefiting from. Costa, son of D.

Kempes was the top goalscorer of the Spanish League in two occasions, in the 76-77 (24 goals) and 77-78 (28 goals) seasons, top goalscorer in the World Cup that took place in his country in 1978 and key player in winning the 1979 Copa del Rey and the 1980 European Cup Winners Cup. His charisma, his free kicks and his scoring ability made an Argentine journalist baptise him with the nickname of ‘Matador’ and the whole of Mestalla would shout ‘Don’t say Kempes, say goal’ every Sunday. A dismissed coach (Heriberto Herrera), a crack like Kempes in the team, players from Valencia who were getting better like Enrique Saura or Ricardo Arias, a good performance of the new signed up players Castellanos, Carrete and Botubot, all those were the keys of the first season of Ramos Costa as president. The Spanish-French Marcel Domingo replaced Heriberto Herrera at the head of the season and he was in charge of returning Valencia to Europe, after a five-year period of absence. Domingo, who came from training Burgos, brought three players with him, the goalkeeper Manzanedo standing out among them. Throughout Ramos Costa's seasons, Valencia never lacked good quality players. Other footballers who arrived within these years were Daniel Solsona and Rainer Bonhof, international German player who had been world champion in 1974. Daniel Solsona, on his side, has been one of the most technical footballers to have played in Valencia. The 78-79 season stood out for the performance in the cup competitions. The competition was not easy. The team managed by Pasieguito, who had replaced Domingo, had to test out against Barça. The outward match had an illuminating result: Barcelona 4 - Valencia 1. The qualifying round seemed sentenced and few people believed in the Valencian recovery. But in the match played in Mestalla, Valencia turned the qualifying round completely and beat the blaugrana team 4-0, result that allowed Valencia to continue in the Cup and go all the way to the final. After Barça, the rivals came from the Second Division, and Valencia comfortably beat Alavés as well as Valladolid. They arrived into the final to face Real Madrid. The setting was in the Vicente Calderón. In the terraces, 25,000 Valencian supporters waved the Valencian flag the senyeras in the Spanish capital, celebrating one of the best victories in the history of the club. Valencia, who played with the senyera kit, was formed by Manzanedo, Carrete, Arias, Botubot, Cerveró, Bonhof, Castellanos, Solsona, Saura, Kempes and Darío Felman and Tendillo took part as well. Valencia won 2-0, both goals by the Argentine star of the “Che” team. Together with Kempes, the most outstanding man in that final was Arias. The celebration in the town of Turia was complete. But it would still be bigger the following season, again in a European competition. After the King's Cup title, Valencia played the European Cup Winners Cup. Pasieguito was again the technical secretary and Alfredo di Stéfano was again in charge of the winning in Europe. Thanks to the European title, the League and the Cup that stood in the background, the 79-80 season was one of the most successful seasons for Valencia. The Mestalla team had to beat quality rivals such Copenhagen, Glasgow Rangers, Barcelona, the French team Nantes and in the final the Londoners' Arsenal. Around 7,000 Valencian people went to Brussels to attend the European final opposite the gunners from Arsenal, who were lower than the English supporters present at the Heysel stadium. The team was composed by Pereira, Carrete, Arias, Tendillo, Botubot, Solsona, Bonhof, Subirats, Saura, Kempes and Pablo. Already in the extra time, Castellanos replaced Subirats. The team was modest and with a lot of tension. After 120 minutes of play and with 0-0 the score, the final had to be solved by penalties. It was the turn for Valencia and for Kempes, who missed the first penalty. The things did not start right. But Ian Brady, also missed his. The following eight in a row were scored (Solsona, Pablo, Castellanos and Bonhof scored for Valencia) and gave way to a sudden death. Ricardo Arias beat Pat Jennings and Pereira became the hero of the final when he stopped Rix's penalty. Euphoria erupted and Saura was in charge of picking up the European Cup Winners' Cup. The 1980-81 season started off with the European Super Cup. No Spanish team up until that year had won this competition, that brings the winner of the European Cup and the winner of the Cup Winners' Cup. Valencia's rival was an old acquaintance, Nottingham Forest, current European and Super Cup champions and a team with great potential. The competition was played on two legs. The English won the first leg, in the mythical City Ground, 2-1, the Valencian goal being scored by the Argentine Felman. Everything was still to be decided at the Luis Casanova. Valencia played with Sempere, Cerveró, Botubot, Arias, Tendillo, Castellanos, Saura, Solsona, Morena, Kempes and Felman. The Uruguayan Fernando Morena scored the only goal of the match and the double value of the away goal scored at the City Ground gave Valencia their first European Super Cup title. As far as the League was concerned, in that season Valencia had a chance of winning the championship, although they did not manage to pull it off. They were fourth in the table, three points behind the leaders: Real Sociedad. One of the reasons for the average performance in the final stage of the league season played by Valencia was the departure of two of the stars of the team, Mario Alberto Kempes and Fernando Morena, who returned to their countries of origin in order to play in River Plate and in Peñarol respectively. From that point, the social and sporting situation of Valencia Club Fútbol started to get worse. The celebration of the World Cup in Spain was a large financial burden for the club, since the upgrading work on the stadium was borne by the club. In the 81-82 season, Valencia had a secondary role and ended up in fifth position in the league. After Kempes and Morena's departure, a great player entered the team, the Danish Frank Arnesen, who was only able to put in a good performance in the first year, since injuries kept him away from the field of play for a long time. A young footballer from Betxí, who would become a symbol of his time also made his debut that year: Roberto Fernández. In the following season (1982-83), the disaster that was on its way started to be visible. The economic situation was getting worse. With Miljan Miljanic as coach, the only joys of the season were the victory in Mestalla against Diego Maradona's Barça, Kempes's return to the team after his short stay in River and the elimination of Manchester United, Banik Ostrava and Spartak Moscú in the UEFA Cup. The rest were nothing but problems and anxiety. With only seven left to play before the end of the season and Valencia was in a desperate situation in the table, Koldo Aguirre replaced Miljanic, who had been dismissed after losing 5-2 in Sarriá. Valencia had to win the last match of the season and wait for the results of its rivals in order to avoid relegation to the Second Division and continue in the first division. In Mestalla, Valencia had to play Real Madrid, who was risking their League title. Valencia won 1-0, with a goal scored by Tendillo. The other results of that round of matches were also favourable for them: Atlético beat Racing Santander in Madrid and Celta Vigo lost in Valladolid, both by 3-1, whilst Las Palmas was beaten 1-5 at the San Mames by Athletic Bilbao, who became champions of La Liga. Valencia had amazingly survived relegation. The following season (83-84) Ramos Costa left the presidency, which was now taken by the cardiologist Vicente Tormo.

The film is a parody of early western films, especially those of William S. Hart. The film was written by Keaton and Edward F. Cline (credited as Eddie Cline). The film runs for around 17 minutes. Sybil Seely and Bonnie Hill co-star in the film. Plot The film opens near the \\"last stop\\", a subway terminal (apparently) in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere. A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with a cutout taken from a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, to appear as if he has an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man looks closer over the cutout and tips it over. Keaton attempts to hand the cash that he has been collecting back, but is thrown out through the window. Keaton offers flowers to his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that it is his own house. Inside, from behind, he sees a man and a woman kissing before a fire. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, moments later to realize his mistake, whereupon he makes his exit. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he spurns her coldly, and she screams in anguish. She goes to a wall, and a vase drops on her head and knocks her unconscious; Keaton glances at her momentarily without interest, and then goes back to thinking again. While investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton's door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife., acting as if all were normal. Seeing this, the officer turns and leaves again, and he drops her on the floor. He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). He quickly dons an elegant white suit and picks flowers (mysteriously growing from the deep snow; a sign reads \\"Keep Off the Grass\\"). He attempts to woo her, but she doesn't appear to favor him. Her husband comes back inside to get something he forgot, and angrily takes his wife away with him after finding Keaton inside the house with her moments after he had left. Keaton bares his teeth threateningly at him as he leaves and they stare each other in the eye. The neighbors leave on a sled for a new, even more bleak northerly location. Keaton gets a \\"car\\" (a cross between a dog sled and an early automobile, with an engine) driven by a friend (Joe Roberts) to follow them, but it breaks down, so he has to hail a passing \\"taxi\\" (a horse drawn sled with upholstery). The taxi is stopped by a traffic warden (riding a classic Harley-Davidson motorcycle frame mounted on skies driven by a pusher propeller - an actual mode of transport, not a joke for the film), but they get away: Keaton is up to his old tricks—he flips the propeller around to reverse the thrust, so after they drive off in the middle of the traffic stop, the officer goes backward into a lake when he restarts his engine to chase them. Near the north pole (sign: North Pole, 3 miles south; perhaps it means North Pole, Alaska?), he and Roberts find a hotel-like igloo with wall-hangings of a stag's head and a guitar. In a gag Keaton tries to hang his hat on a stag head antler but it falls off. They attempt to survive by fishing in the manner of the Eskimos. Keaton makes snow-shoes from guitars and attempts to catch fish using tinned sardines as bait, but just creates trouble—he first falls through the ice and then tries to fish—but the only things he \\"catches\\" are another fisherman's strung fish and the other fisherman himself! Forced to flee back to the igloo, where his companion is using a carpet sweeper on the ice floor, Keaton sees his pretty neighbor again in her new hut. Apparently fortified by drinking a bottle of cola, grimacing as if it were strong liquor, he decides he will go and make another attempt to win or coerce the other woman. He appears at her hut, and enters, to her distress. Upon hearing the husband returning to the hut to show his wife some gold he had just panned out of the water, Keaton resolutely bars the door with his arm, to prevent the husband from entering, only to discover the door hinges on the other side. After jumping and falling out the window, he disguises himself as a snowman to elude the husband when he runs out of the door in pursuit, and returns to the hut, where he is momentarily shown dressed as Erich von Stroheim's character from the film Foolish Wives, to indicate his villainous intent to force himself on her (or her apprehension of his intent). The husband reappears outside, searching for his wife, scanning the horizon; while he is searching for her, Roberts approaches him wearing clumsy cross- country skies, without being noticed, and stabs him in the arm. The husband appears to punch the friend so hard he flies through the air and lands headfirst in the ice fishing hole from earlier in the film. The husband returns to find his wife weeping on the floor as Keaton stands over her. He pulls out his own knife, and wrestles with Keaton. Keaton's wife appears outside the window, and shoots her husband in the back as they struggle. AS husband and wife embrace, the wounded Keaton lying on the floor takes a derringer from his pocket and points it at the husband, but at that moment a janitor wakes Keaton up in the front row of a film theater (the gun in the last scene turns out to be a folded newspaper in his hand) and Keaton realizes that it was all a dream! Production The film followed Roscoe Arbuckle's arrest for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. While studio executives ordered Arbuckle's industry friends and fellow actors (whose careers they controlled) not to publicly speak up for him, Keaton did make a public statement in support of Arbuckle's innocence. However, William S. Hart, who had never met or worked with Arbuckle, made a number of damaging public statements in which he presumed that Arbuckle was guilty. Arbuckle later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully and wife beater which Keaton purchased from him. Hart was widely believed in the industry to be \\"prone to domestic violence\\" and Keaton believed that Hart was helping to convict Arbuckle. Keaton produced, directed and starred in The Frozen North, the film that resulted. Keaton wears a small version of Hart's campaign hat from the Spanish–American War and a six-shooter on each thigh, and during the scene in which he shoots the neighbor and her husband, he reacts with thick glycerin tears, a trademark of Hart's.p.23, p.11, p.27 Keaton spoofs Hart's demeanor, and comically attempts Hart's iconic one handed cigarette roll. Keaton spends a lot of time standing and staring to imply Hart's wooden acting, which is reinforced in the scene where he puts a picture of a cowboy in a doorway to dupe gamblers, and the image on the picture is Hart. Audiences of the 1920s recognized the parody and thought the film hysterically funny. However, Hart himself was not amused by Keaton's antics, particularly the crying scene, and did not speak to Keaton for two years after he had seen the film.Keaton, Eleanor, and Vance, Jeffrey. Buster Keaton Remembered, H.N. Abrams, 2001, p. 95 The comedy also briefly parodies Erich von Stroheim's womanizing character from the film Foolish Wives. In contrast to Hart, von Stroheim was delighted with the parody of his character. The film was photographed on location at Donner Lake outside Truckee, California, in mid- winter. The film's opening intertitles give it its mock-serious tone, and are taken from The Shooting of Dan McGrew by Robert W. Service. Many of the gag sequences from The Frozen North, including the fishing sequence and wearing guitars as snowshoes while carrying a mattress, were later used by The Three Stooges in Rockin' thru the Rockies. The gag of a protagonist being in a film in a dream sequence and waking up in the end is also in the film Sherlock Jr..

Retrieved November 6, 2017. called The Committee of 1926 for use as a historic house museum and place of hospitality. William Lewis William Lewis was born in 1751 in Edgmont, Pennsylvania to a Quaker family of Welsh ancestry. As a lawyer during revolutionary times, he consistently defended other Quakers against charges of treason after they refused to fight in battle or pay taxes. In doing so, he helped create the foundations of Conscientious Objection. Lewis was appointed to federal judicial positions by George Washington and also advised Alexander Hamilton on the first national bank. His most important achievement was his role in the drafting and passage of An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1780. This legislation was the first legal action towards the abolition of slavery in the United States. Lewis purchased land in what is now Fairmount Park, including some existing buildings, and proceeded to built the mansion—which he called Summerville—sometime between 1783 and 1789. Lewis lived there until his death in 1819 at the age of 68. Joseph Hemphill Joseph Hemphill was born in 1770 in Chester County, now Delaware County. He purchased Strawberry Mansion in 1821, two years after Lewis's death. His family was responsible for adding the Greek Revival wings to the Federal style structure erected by Lewis, ca. 1828. He served as a member of the House of Representatives, in addition to being a prominent lawyer and judge. Hemphill is, perhaps, more well known among antique collectors for his role in the limited manufacture of Hemphill and Tucker porcelain. His collaborative effort with Philadelphia porcelain maker William Ellis Tucker lasted only 6 years, from 1832 to 1838. Property of Fairmount Park In 1867 Strawberry Mansion was sold to the city by a landowner who had been in possession of it since Judge Hemphill's death in 1842. The purchase of the mansion, along with a great deal of the surrounding land, was part of an effort to protect the source of the city's drinking water, the Schuylkill River. The area was named East Fairmount Park, under the supervision of the Fairmount Park Commission. Renovations In 1926, several women's clubs combined efforts with Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick to create a Sesquicentennial Exposition in South Philadelphia in honor of the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Several women from the event did not want to disband, and instead sought an area to move many of the antique furniture collections to another location. Under the supervision of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Fairmount Park Commission, the new Committee of 1926 renovated Strawberry Mansion to be used as a museum and place of hospitality. Funds for the renovation were donated by Joseph Horn, of Horn and Hardart's automats. Horn grew up in the Philadelphia area and was fond of playing in the park as a child. Decor and furnishings were the charge of various women's societies throughout the city who filled the rooms with exceptional period furnishings. The house officially reopened in 1931 with Mrs. J. Willis Martin (Elizabeth Price) as the first president of the Committee of 1926. Today the Committee of 1926 continues to preserve the historic house museum and the principles of hospitality on which it was founded. Strawberry Mansion was renovated again in the early 21st century. Tours Historic Strawberry Mansion is open February–December. During February the house is open for tours 10am-4pm on Saturdays and Sundays by appointment only. During March the house is open 10am-4pm Thursday through Saturday and Sundays by appointment only.

The project was designed to examine the effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies and programs implemented by national and local governments and to see how the social and economic transformation of Chinese society is affecting the health and nutritional status of its population. The impact on nutrition and health behaviors and outcomes is gauged by changes in community organizations and programs as well as by changes in sets of household and individual economic, demographic, and social factors. The survey was conducted by an international team of researchers whose backgrounds include nutrition, public health, economics, sociology, Chinese studies, and demography. The survey took place over a three-day period using a multistage, random cluster process to draw a sample of about 4,400 households with a total of 19,000 individuals in nine provinces that vary substantially in geography, economic development, public resources, and health indicators. In addition, detailed community data were collected in surveys of food markets, health facilities, family planning officials, and other social services and community leaders.  CHNS Data Description  The study population is drawn from the nine provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Shandong. This sample is diverse with variation found in a wide-ranging set of socioeconomic factors (income, employment, education and modernization) and other related health, nutritional and demographic measures. A multistage, random cluster process was used to draw the sample surveyed in each of the provinces. Counties in the 9 provinces were stratified by income (low, middle, and high) and a weighted sampling scheme was used to randomly select four counties in each province. In addition, the provincial capital and a lower income city were selected when feasible, except that other large cities rather than provincial capitals had to be selected in two provinces. Villages and townships within the counties and urban and suburban neighborhoods within the cities were selected randomly. In 1989-1993 there were 190 primary sampling units: 32 urban neighborhoods, 30 suburban neighborhoods, 32 towns (county capital city), and 96 rural villages. Since 2000, the primary sampling units have increased to 216: 36 urban neighborhoods, 36 suburban neighborhoods, 36 towns and 108 villages.  Sample  CHNS 1989 included 3,795 households. 3,616 households, 3,441 households, 3,875 households, and 4,403 households participated in CHNS 1991, CHNS1993, CHNS 1997 and CHNS 2000, respectively. All individuals in each household were surveyed in 1991, 1993, 1997 and 2000 for all data; however in 1989, health and nutritional data were only collected from preschoolers and adults aged 20–45. CHNS 1989 surveyed 15,917 individuals. CHNS 1991 only surveyed individuals belonging to the original sample households which resulted in a total of 14,778 individuals. In CHNS 1993, all new households formed from sample households who resided in sample areas were added to this sample, resulting in a total of 13,893 individuals. In CHNS 1997, all newly formed households who resided in sample areas and additional households to replace those no longer participating were added to the sample. New communities were also added to replace communities no longer participating, and Heilongjiang province replaced Liaoning province. A total of 14,426 individuals participated in 1997. In CHNS 2000, newly formed households, replacement households, and replacement communities were again added, and Liaoning province returned to the study. A total of 15,648 individuals participated in 2000.  Household Survey Data Collection  Detailed demographic, economic, time use, labor force participation, asset ownership, and expenditure data were obtained. Income can be approximated from the survey in 3 ways: through responses to direct questions about income, through the summation of net receipts from all reported activities, and through responses to questions about expenditures. Full income from market and non-market activities can be imputed. This detailed estimation of income represents a significant advance in the measurement of income in China. Inclusion of non-monetary government subsidies, such as state-subsidized housing, is an especially important advance. In the health section, details about insurance coverage, availability of medical facilities, curative care and illness information with associated time and money costs, preventive care with a focus on immunizations, and use of family planning and other preventive services were obtained.  Health and Nutrition Survey  All household members in 1991 and subsequent surveys provided individual data on dietary intake, body composition, blood pressure, health history, and health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, beverage consumption, medication, key chronic diseases). These data include dietary intake for 3 consecutive days as well as detailed physical examinations that include blood pressure (for adults), clinical measures of health, weight, height, and arm and head circumference (and also waist-hip ratios beginning in 1993). The 3 consecutive days during which detailed household food consumption data were collected were randomly allocated from Monday to Sunday and are almost equally balanced across the 7 days of the week for each sampling unit. Household food consumption was determined by examining changes in inventory from the beginning to the end of each day, in combination with a weighing and measurement technique. Chinese balances with a maximum limit of 15 kilograms and a minimum of 20 grams were used. All processed foods (including edible oils and salt) remaining after the last meal before initiation of the survey were weighed and recorded. All purchases, home production, and processed snack foods were recorded. Whenever foods were brought into the household unit, they were weighed and preparation waste (e.g., spoiled rice, discarded cooked meals fed to pets or animals) was estimated when weighing was not possible. At the end of the survey, all remaining foods were again weighed and recorded. The number of household members and visitors were recorded at each meal. Individual dietary intake for the same three consecutive days was surveyed for all children aged 1 to 6 and all adults aged 20 to 45 in 1989, and for all individuals in later years. This was achieved by asking individuals each day to report all food consumed away from home on a 24-hour recall basis, and the same daily interview was used to collect at-home individual consumption. In a few cases, subjects missed one day due to absence, but over 99 percent of the sample was available for the full three days of data. The collection of both household and individual dietary intake allowed us to check the quality of data collection by comparing the two. Thus, each individual's average daily dietary intake, calculated from the household survey, was compared with his or her dietary intake based on 24-hour recall data. Where significant discrepancies were found, the household and the individual in question were revisited and asked about their food consumption in order to resolve these discrepancies. All field workers were trained nutritionists who are otherwise professionally engaged in nutrition work in their own counties and who have participated in other national surveys. Almost all interviewers were graduates of post-secondary schools; many had four-year degrees. In addition, 3 days of specific training in the collection of dietary data were provided for this survey. The 1991 Food Composition Table (FCT) for China was utilized to calculate nutrient values for the dietary data of 2000 and previous years. This FCT represents a significant advance over the earlier China FCT both for higher quality chemical analyses and for improved techniques of developing average nutrient values for foods whose nutrient value varies over the country in a geographic context. The UNC group has worked with the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety to update and improve this FCT. A new version of FCT (2002) was used for 2004 survey and the latest version (2004) was used for 2006 survey.  Child Physical Activity  Two methods of collecting physical activity and inactivity data from respondent children were used, beginning in 1997. The first is based on questionnaires which collect reports of usual time spent in activities common in each of four settings. Activity questionnaires were designed by Barry Popkin and Barbara Ainsworth. Ainsworth was also involved in the design and evaluation of the activity questions for the U.S. Health Interview Surveys (HIS), the MONICA Optional Study of Physical Activity (MOSPA), and more recently the new International Physical Activity questionnaire for WHO. We expanded upon the U.S. HIS questions to include activity and inactivity, including TV viewing and other sedentary activities such as using computers, playing board games, and reading. Activities in and out of school, as well as culture-specific activity at home were included. The second method involves measurement of motion in a 24-hour period using the Caltrac actometer. A subset of Chinese children provided these data. The Caltrac is a low-cost device that looks like a beeper and is attached to the waist. It registers motion in two dimensions, and gives an estimate of total energy expenditure. The Caltrac was selected because it provides reasonably reliable and valid estimates of total activity, is cost effective, is feasible for use in a variety of field settings, is non-invasive and is well-accepted by children. Questions on sleeping time and the nature of that day for the child are also asked in conjunction with the Caltrac data. However, this was discontinued in 2004.  Adult Physical Activity  A small set of questions about the nature of occupation work was included in 1997 and later surveys to capture some energy expenditure-related dimensions of each adult's work. Included were questions about the physical activity involved in the work. This complements one set of energy expenditure questions that have been asked as part of the nutrition data collection for all adults since 1989. =The Elderly Component= Since 1997 survey, we collect a full series of questions on activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living along with a shorter set of cognition questions. Drs. Robert Wallace and Namvar Zohoori developed these in Beijing in collaboration with the Chinese group. Wallace, who is responsible for the health component of the National Health and Retirement Survey in the US, and Zohoori began with a comparable set of questions and adjusted them to fit the Chinese reality. Additional questions have been added on time use for the care of older persons living inside and outside the home, and inter-generational transfers from children to their parents and vice versa. The CHNS obtain data quite similar to that collected by the National Health and Retirement Survey now for many dimensions of elderly behavior. For CHNS93 and all subsequent surveys, we have developed and added questionnaire components on activities of daily living (ADL) and intergenerational transfers from adult children to their older parents and vice versa. With the exception of some adaptation to the Chinese situation, the ADL survey is designed to be comparable with the Health and Retirement Survey and other U.S.-based National Center of Health Statistics surveys. This section was considerably refined based on the state of art at the time of the survey and on the pretests undertaken in China. We collected not only the standard ADL data, but also implemented an independent approach termed the PULSES approach. The PULSES score is less sensitive for the elderly than for other groups, so it can be used only in an elementary way for checking the predictive ability of the ADL measures. The PULSES score taps a wider dimension than physical functioning, but provides much less detail on each item. Other approaches were used to check the predictive validity of the ADL data. Internal consistency and observer consistency (inter- and intra- observer) studies were undertaken. In addition, CHNS93 enlarged the depth and range of measures of help received by household members as well as parallel measures of help given by household members. We asked about caregiving and help in getting access to scarce or valuable resources. To obtain information about help we added new questions about access to scarce commodities, such as foreign cigarettes or appliances, help in getting special foods needed to treat a variety of illnesses, and help in figuring out how to find the best doctor if someone is ill. For each household member, information about the source of assistance included age, gender, relation to respondent (including living in the household or not, and if not, whether previously resided in the household; and whether the helper was a relative, school classmate, work friend, or neighbor), occupation, and political status (party member, cadre). Similar information was collected about those receiving help from household members. Since a good deal of information about caregiving was already collected, our task was to fill in all the missing pieces so that complete and consistent information was gathered for all household members. The CHNS data are part of a broader initiative to create modules sensitive to questions of aging. Many of the measures mentioned above are part of what is termed inter- generational transfers. The typical and most important categories are the transfer of money between elderly family members (who may or may not be members of the sample household) and the exchange of food, clothing, and child care/elder care. Body Image and Mass Media Behaviors and Practices In 2000 and later surveys, body images were created to match Chinese body types. All children aged 6–18 were asked about their desired body type and actual body type using card shuffle techniques. These were developed by Jane Brown and Peggy Bentley with the help of Penny Gordon-Larsen, all UNC faculty working in this area. In addition, each child was asked a selected set of questions related to the mass media. The mother was asked a series of related questions about mass media and television related to the children. These were included in the Ever-Married Women questionnaire for women with a child aged 6–18.  Ever-Married Women Survey  Information from all ever-married women aged under 52 was collected beginning in 1991. The questions in this section were revised and expanded in 1993. These data include complex marriage and fertility histories and additional information was also collected on family planning, pregnancies, and infant feeding during inter-survey intervals.  Community Survey  The community questionnaire (filled out for each of the primary sampling units) collected information from a knowledgeable respondent on community infrastructure (water, transport, electricity, communications, and so on), services (family planning, health facilities, retail outlets), population, prevailing wages, and related variables.  Food Market Survey  In the first two CHNS surveys, state and free market data were collected. But by 1997, none of our communities had separate state prices so only free market stores and large stores were visited. In all cases prices were collected for a representative basket of commodities.  Health and Family Planning Facility Surveys  In 1989, 1991 and 1993, separate visits were made to obtain in- depth data in each community for every identified health service and family planning provider or facility. Information was collected concerning personnel, sources of funds, services available, prices (asked separately for insured and self-pay patients), and distance to the primary sampling units served by the facility. A separate questionnaire was administered to the local family planning official about family planning policies in the community. These were discontinued in 1997, but selected questions were asked of these same personnel as part of the community questionnaire. Quality Control Procedures Extensive changes were made to substantially increase quality control for the 1991 and 1993 rounds of the CHNS (Chinese Health and Nutrition Survey) after some problems were uncovered in the procedures of several provinces as part of the CHNS 1989 activities. Those problems have been corrected and the CHNS 1989 data are now of high quality. The design and implementation of the training of field staff involved in data collection and office staff handling data entry, checking, and cleaning have become an established part of work in China. Extended trips to the U.S. for training and data processing staff have helped with this effort. The Institute felt these visits were so important that they allocated additional scarce foreign exchange funds from their own budget for this training. The internal controls on quality of measurement are based on collecting measures of selected factors from multiple perspectives and then using these data to refine measurement. One example is dietary fat. Typically, an average amount of fat used on a dish-by-dish basis is used to estimate fat intake. This procedure is also used for other condiments and minor food elements. In this study, the household measures allow us to develop household-specific measurements for factors which truly vary by such an amount as to change energy intake for family members by 12-15%, depending on the use of average or household-specific measures. For income, family composition, and other measures, similar checks are used to provide much more precise refinement of important factors.

When the war broke out, the Germans had only two older mine-laying cruisers. Although most German cruisers were fitted for mine-laying, a need for fast specialized ships existed. The Imperial Russian Navy had ordered a set of steam turbines for the Navarin from the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin. This machinery was confiscated on the outbreak of war and used for these ships. Both vessels were built by AG Vulcan. The two ships laid a series of minefields during their career, though their most significant success came in October 1917, when they attacked a British convoy to Norway. They sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships from the convoy. They escaped back to Germany without damage. The two ships were interned at Scapa Flow after the end of the war, and were subsequently scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919. Brummer was sunk in deep water and was never raised, but Bremse was brought up in 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933. Design and construction In 1914, AG Vulcan in Stettin was building two sets of high-powered steam turbines for the Russian Navy for use in their new battlecruiser Navarin, then under construction in Russia. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, which saw Germany and Russia on opposing sides, the German government seized the turbines.Novik, p. 185 At that time, the Kaiserliche Marine possessed only two cruisers equipped for mine-laying operations, the cruisers and . The Kaiserliche Marine ordered AG Vulcan to split Navarins propulsion system in half and to design a pair of cruiser hulls around the engines. The ships were to be fast mine-layers, capable of mining an area under cover of darkness and quickly returning to port before they could be intercepted. They were designed to resemble the British s to aid in their ability to operate off the British coast. Design work on the ships was completed quickly in 1914. Brummer was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in early 1915. Work proceeded quickly, and the ship was launched on 11 December 1915. After the completion of fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 2 April 1916.Gröner, p. 113 Bremse followed her sister the same year at AG Vulcan. She was launched on 11 March 1916 and completed in less than four months; the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1916. During construction, the shape of their bow and its resemblance to British cruisers was covered by sheet metal. =General characteristics= Brummer and Bremse were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ships had a designed displacement of , and at full load, they displaced . Their hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames. The hulls were divided into twenty-one watertight compartments and incorporated a double bottom that extended for forty-four percent of the length of the keel.Gröner, p. 112 Brummer differed slightly, as she had a row of portholes amidships that her sister Bremse did not have. Brummer and Bremse were fitted with masts similar to the British Arethusa-class cruisers, and similarly to the British ships, the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck. Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa-class ships to further disguise the vessels. The ships had a complement of 16 officers and 293 enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two dinghies. The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea. In hard turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very crank, however. =Machinery= The two ships' propulsion systems consisted of two turbines powered by two coal-fired Marine Doppelkessel double-ended water-tube boilers and four oil-fired Öl-Marine double-ended boilers.Novik, p. 186 The turbines drove a pair of three-bladed screw propellers, which were in diameter. The engines were rated at for a top speed of . On trials, Brummer reached while Bremse made ; they averaged a top speed of with a light load. The ships were capable of speeds up to ,Massey, p. 747 though only in short bursts. Coal storage was as designed, though up to could be carried. Fuel oil was initially , and could be similarly increased to . At a cruising speed of , the ships could steam for . At a higher speed of , the range fell considerably, to . Electrical power was provided by two turbo generators and one diesel generator. Steering was controlled by a single, large rudder. =Armament and armor= One of Bremses 15 cm guns salvaged at Scapa Flow The ships were armed with four SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts; all four were placed on the centerline so all four guns could fire on the broadside. One was placed forward on the forecastle, a second was located between the first and second funnel and two were arranged in a superfiring pair aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 162 These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 600 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. Brummer and Bremse also carried two SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels. These guns fired a shells at a muzzle velocity of . The ships were also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with four torpedoes in a swivel mount amidships. Designed as mine- layers, they carried up to 450 mines, depending on the type. Two rails ran down the main deck to the stern to allow the mines to be dropped behind the ship.Novik, p. 188 The Brummer-class cruisers' armor was fabricated from Krupp cemented steel. The ships were protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships; the bow and stern were not armored. The deck was covered with thick armor plate. Gun shields thick protected the 15 cm gun battery crews. The conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof. Atop the conning tower was the bridge, which included a splinter-proof chart house. All three funnels were equipped with a steel glacis for splinter protection. Service After their commissioning, Brummer and Bremse served with the High Seas Fleet, including on a sortie into the North Sea in October 1916. The ships laid a minefield off Norderney in January 1917 and guarded minesweepers between March and May that year. In October 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer sent the two ships to attack a British convoy to Norway to divert forces protecting convoys in the Atlantic. Scheer chose Brummer and Bremse because of their high speed and large radius of action. Shortly after dawn on 17 October, the two cruisers attacked the convoy, which consisted of twelve merchant ships, two destroyers, and two armed trawlers. In the ensuing action off Lerwick, the German ships quickly sank the escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve cargo vessels. The British Admiralty was not informed of the attack until Brummer and Bremse were safely steaming back to Germany.Halpern, p. 376 Along with the most modern units of the High Seas Fleet, Brummer and Bremse were included in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers. The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 in single file, commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.Herwig, p. 254 Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, and so he ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships.Herwig, p. 256 Brummer sank at 13:05; she was never raised for scrapping and remains on the bottom of Scapa Flow. Bremse sank at 14:30 and was ultimately raised on 27 November 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933 in Lyness.

They were successful in the early 1980s, but by the mid-1980s, their popularity began to decline, and the members split up.Lustans Lakejer interview Electricity Club They were initially influenced by 1970's art rock and post-punk acts like Roxy Music, David Bowie, Joy Division, Magazine and Ultravox but adopted a more sophisticated synthpop and new romantic style on their most successful albums Uppdrag i Genève and En plats i solen. The latter album was produced by Richard Barbieri from the British group Japan and featured saxophone playing on three tracks by Mick Karn. The following year an English-language version of that album, A Place in the Sun, was released under the group name Vanity Fair, but with no commercial success. By 1984 Johan Kinde had parted ways with the other original members and released two further albums as Lustans Lakejer and then embarked on a solo career. Lustans Lakejer reformed in the 1990s and released the critically acclaimed album Åkersberga in 1999.

The broadcast, composed mostly of light music, sketches and humour, was among the most popular programmes of the Polish Radio in the period between the world wars. Started in 1933, it remained on the air until the Invasion of Poland of 1939. As the idea of an all-day-long programme prepared by one of the regional branches of the Polish Radio, rather than by the central editorial office, was a novelty, the initial broadcasts were prepared almost free of charge by amateur journalists and comedians. With time it became one of the most successful broadcasts of the Polish Radio, recognized countrywide. The author of most of the sketches was Wiktor Budzyński. Among the best-known comedians associated with the Merry Wave were the Szczepcio and Tońcio duo, known for their dialogues in the Lwów dialect. Other notable personalities were Mieczysław Monderer and Adolf Fleischen who parodied the local Jewish community, as well as Włada Majewska, Wilhelm Korabiowski and many more.

History  The Lublin region has a fine architectural heritage. It was at the end of the 16th century that the first fully developed forms of Renaissance architecture were imported into the Lublin region. The beginning of the next century saw an enormous increase in the number of fine religious buildings developed as a result of the great wealth created by the Lublin region being one of the most important exporters of grain to Western Europe. The majority of churches were erected by architects of Italian origin who in this way created a local style known as the Lublin Renaissance. Churches built in this style are aisleless with a bigger presbytery than is usual, which ends in a semicircle, as well as having a barrel vault. Their distinctive features are richly ornamented gables and stucco decoration of the interior. The Lublin Renaissance is best represented by the churches in Lublin, Końskowola and Kazimierz Dolny. Visitors will also be entranced by the rich ornamentation of the Renaissance house fronts, especially the high attics of the houses in a number of the region's towns and villages. The best examples of these are the Przybyłów and Celejowska houses also in Kazimierz Dolny. Gallery Image:Lublin Kalinowszczyzna kosciol sw Agnieszki 05.jpgSt Agnes Church in Lublin.

The school closed on 31 August 2009, being replaced by the Sir Robert Woodard Academy. History Lancing Senior Mixed Council School opened in Irene Avenue, Lancing in 1935, in the buildings currently occupied by the Globe Primary School. The original site was intended to accommodate up to 360 pupils between the ages of 11 and 14. It was moved to its current site on Boundstone Lane in 1960 where it became Lancing Secondary Modern School. Pupils wishing to attend grammar school travelled to either Worthing or Shoreham. Boundstone became one of the \\"Comprehensives\\" from the autumn term of 1967, continuing to cater for an intake from 11 years old upwards – five forms plus a two-year Sixth. The first comprehensive intake graduated from the Sixth Form in 1974. In 1975, West Sussex County Council reorganised provision in the area. Boundstone became a comprehensive upper school for pupils aged 12 and over, while younger pupils stayed at primary middle schools until this age. In 2008, this change was reverted, and Boundstone once again became a full secondary school for pupils aged 11 to 18. The school closed on 31 August 2009, being replaced by an academy operated by a partnership between West Sussex County Council and the Woodard Schools organisation. The new academy is called the Sir Robert Woodard Academy. Campus The college was based on, and named after Boundstone Lane, the historic boundary between the villages of Sompting and Lancing, the two main communities which the college served. The boundstone or boundary stone which marked the boundary between the villages survives and was kept at the college, which was entirely on the Sompting side of the boundary. At the time of the change to the age of transfer of pupils, a new building was completed to house new Year 7 pupils. After the renaming to Woodard Academy, the school was completely rebuilt on its existing site, and the 1960s buildings were demolished in early 2012. Curriculum Boundstone Community College was designated a specialist college for the performing arts in 2002. The academy which replaced the school has twin specialisms of Performing Arts and Mathematics.

The station's young general manager, Bill Kling, then persuaded Saint John's to sign on a repeater for the Twin Cities, KSJN.

The pod mounted on the belly of an Air Atlanta Europe 747 which was leased by FedEx for the flight tests in May, 2006 Pod mounted on the 747 The Northrop Grumman Guardian is a passive anti-missile countermeasure system designed specifically to protect commercial airliners from shoulder-launched missiles (commonly known as MANPADS), using directed infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) technology. According to the Wall Street Journal, the program is now the subject of a lawsuit alleging that \\"in 2007 and 2008 the company intentionally inflated costs, presented false bills, lied about progress and withheld test data from the Department of Homeland Security.\\"Suit Alleges Northrop Defrauded U.S. of $62 Million Background The extensive proliferation of MANPADS has resulted in many being available to non-state groups on the international arms black market, sometimes for as little as US$5,000 each. This has resulted in a marked increase of MANPADS attacks on commercial airliners, including the failed 2002 Mombasa airliner attack, the 2003 Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident and the 2007 Mogadishu TransAVIAexport Airlines Il-76 crash. According to the U.S. State Department, over 40 civilian aircraft have been hit with MANPADS since 1970, with about 400 passengers and crewmembers killed. Of these, six were airliners. In 2003, Senator Barbara Boxer (CA-D) and Congressman Steve Israel (NY-D) introduced legislation in both the House and Senate (H.R. 580/S. 311 The Commercial Airline Missile Defense Act) that directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to sponsor a research and development program that would result in a missile defense system that could be installed on commercial airliners; the bill also authorized funding for the program. As a result, the DHS initiated the \\"counter-MANDPADS\\" or \\"C-MANPADS\\" program in January, 2004, which tasked several defense contractors to adapt existing military countermeasures systems to commercial usage.\\"The Department of Homeland Security C-MANPADS Program\\", Northrop Grumman  Description  The Guardian incorporates existing infrared countermeasures military technology, adapted from the AAQ-24 Nemesis system, in a commercial package that has been tested and certified by the FAA under a Supplemental Type Certificate for the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10/MD-10 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.Northrop Grumman fact sheet Guardian is designed to operate autonomously, without input from the flight crew. An array of sensors detects a missile approaching the aircraft and passes this information to an infrared tracking camera. The system's computer analyses the input signals, to confirm that the threat is real, and then directs a beam of an eye-safe infrared laser at the incoming object. The laser is intended to introduce a false target into the missile's guidance system, causing it to turn away from the aircraft. The detect-track-jam process lasts for two to three seconds. The system then automatically notifies the pilot and air traffic control that a threat has been jammed. The system is wholly contained in an external, 460 mm (18 inch) high pod that weighs 250 kg (550 lb) and is mounted to the underside of the fuselage. The pod is removable, and can be transferred to another aircraft within an hour. The system costs US$1 million per aircraft, and, when ongoing maintenance costs are also considered, Northrop Grumman estimates that the system will cost each passenger an additional dollar in ticket price. Development The Guardian was developed under a DHS program. In August, 2005, Northrop Grumman received DHS phase II design approval of the system after it met three main design review criteria.\\"Northrop Grumman Completes Design of Commercial Aircraft Protection System\\", Northrop Grumman press release, August 22, 2005 Also, as a part of Phase II of the DHS program, flight testing began in August, 2005 on a FedEx Express McDonnell Douglas MD-11. Flight tests were then conducted on a Boeing 747 which FedEx leased from Air Atlanta Icelandic. The flight tests were conducted at the Mojave Civilian Aerospace Test Center with the aircraft flying simulated takeoff and landing profiles while being engaged by an electronic system that simulates missile tracking and launch events. The simulator reported tests to be 100% successful. A civilian version of the system is being developed under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Project CHLOE. The Air National Guard has tested the system on the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft. Deployment An operational Guardian pod can be seen on the belly of this FedEx Express MD-10 between and just aft of the main landing gear The third phase of the program, costing US$109 million is the deployment of the system on commercial flights. FedEx Express became the first air carrier to deploy the Guardian on a commercial flight in September 2006, when it equipped one of its MD-11 freighters with the pod, and subsequently equipped eight more aircraft for evaluation purposes. In view of the initially successful results, Congress directed DHS in October, 2006 to expand the program to include \\"a service evaluation in the passenger-carrying environment.\\" This will result in 12 commercial airliners to be equipped with the system to gather data on the system's operational impact in regular service.

Biography 100px Élisabeth was born in Paris. Her father was César de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, legitimised son of King Henry IV of France and his official mistress Gabrielle d'Estrées. Her mother was Princess Françoise of Lorraine (1592–1669), daughter and heiress of Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur, himself a rival of Henry IV. Her mother was the Duchess of Mercœur and Penthièvre in her own right and was the greatest heiress of her time. Styled as Mademoiselle de Vendôme prior to marriage, she was the second of three children; she had two brothers, the Frondeur François de Bourbon, Duke of Beaufort and Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme whose wife Laura Mancini was a niece of Cardinal Mazarin. They were the parents of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, a very successful military commander and a Marshal of France. On 11 July 1643 at the Louvre, Mademoiselle de Vendôme married Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours. The young prince was a member of a cadet branch of the house of Savoy which had settled in France. The young prince was a direct descendant of Philip II, Duke of Savoy as was Élisabeth. They had two daughters who would marry the heirs to the thrones of Savoy and Portugal, and three sons who died shortly after birth. In 1652 the Duke of Nemours was killed by her brother François, Duke of Beaufort in a duel. Élisabeth herself died in Paris. She managed to secure the income of the lands of Nemours for her two daughters, but the titles were inherited by other members of the family. In early 1653, she travelled to Scotland where she wed Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, courtier and royalist with whom she had six children. She died in Paris on the 19th May, 1664.

A pass consists of an intentional transfer of the ball from one player to another of the same team. Examples of sports that involve passing are association football, basketball, ice hockey, and American football. Certain games only allow backward passing (for example, rugby football), while others allow both. Of those that allow forward passing, some prohibit the receiver from being ahead of the pass at a certain point on the field (e.g., the offside rule in ice hockey), while other do not (e.g., American football). Passing in basketball has been defined as \\"The deliberate attempt to move a live ball between two teammates\\", a definition which might equally apply across other sports equally well, albeit with a change to the item being passed where appropriate. In certain sports, a pass to a teammate that leads to a successful scoring move is recorded, and tracked. In many sports, including basketball and ice hockey, this action is known as an assist. In basketball, only the last pass before a successful score is credited as an assist. Ice hockey attributes up to two assists on a goal scoring play. In that case, the last two teammates (not including the goal scorer) to touch the puck before the goal is scored would be credited with an assist. A team with a high number of assists demonstrates effective ball (or puck) passing between teammates, which is critical in most team sports, as it tends to lead to more, and higher quality scoring opportunities. In baseball, the ball is only passed between teammates on defense. The goal is to pass the ball from one teammate to another so they can either tag, or force out a base runner. Assists are also tracked in baseball, and any defender that touches a fairly hit ball that leads to a putout is credited. History of passing Many early references to football refer to balls \\"flying high\\" and being \\"hit here\\". These, however, cannot be considered to be passing as there is no indication that they were between players of the same team. Similarly, they may not have been intentional passes (as opposed to fortuitously trying to move a ball upfield to gain possession). Passing is first described in Cornish hurling. Modern passing was a feature of some English public school football games (for example, at Rugby school) and these were developed further by public school missionaries in teams such as Sheffield FC (1860s)and The Royal Engineers AFC (late 1860/early 1870s).

Dose dumping is most commonly seen in drugs taken by mouth and digested in the gastrointestinal tract. Around the same time patients take their medication, they can also ingest other substances like fatty meals or alcohol that increase drug delivery. The substances may act on the drug's capsule to speed up drug release, or they may stimulate the body's absorptive surfaces to increase the rate of drug uptake. Dose dumping is a disadvantage found in extended release dosage form. In general, drug companies try to avoid drugs with significant dose dumping effects. Such drugs are prone to problems and are often pulled from the market.

Alejo Lascano brought the first forceps to Ecuador and founded the Medicine Faculty in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Early years Alejo Lascano was born in Jipijapa, Manabí, Ecuador, the legitimate son of Jose Francisco Lascano, an exporting retailer of straw hats, and Josefa Bahamonde Gracés. Both were wealthy Guayaquileños. Alejo left Guayaquil on February 1, 1857, and entered the Medicine School of Paris, considered the first scientific center of the world, studying with professor Geienau de Mussy. After finishing school in the Lauguier Clinic of Paris, he obtained the Doctorate of Medicine and Surgery on July 17, 1864, and his thesis was received highly favourably by Professor Jacoub. Back in Ecuador Lascano was 24 years of age when he returned to his mother country. In Guayaquil a medicine faculty still did not exist. In 1867 he founded and organized the Facultad de Medicina del Guayas. He was so popular with customers that he became the first doctor of the city. For that reason in 1869, García Moreno appointed Lascano Doctor for Life of the Hospital Civil de Guayaquil. Final years He was a connoisseur of therapeutic, chemical pharmacology and biology, as well as in botany. Lascano had a slow cancer to the stomach.

Philosophical Library, 1948) The Ethics of Ambiguity () is Simone de Beauvoir's second major non-fiction work. It was prompted by a lecture she gave in 1945, after which she claimed that it was impossible to base an ethical system on her partner Jean-Paul Sartre's major philosophical work Being and Nothingness (). The following year, over a six-month period, she took on the challenge, publishing the resulting text first as installments in Les Temps modernes and then, in November 1947, as a book.  Contents  The Ethics of Ambiguity consists of three parts and a short conclusion. = Part I = \\"Ambiguity and Freedom,\\" lays out the philosophical underpinnings of de Beauvoir's stance on ethics. She asserts that man is fundamentally free, a freedom that comes from his \\"nothingness,\\" which is an essential aspect of his ability to be self-aware, to be conscious of himself: \\"... the nothingness which is at the heart of man is also the consciousness that he has of himself.\\" But man is also a thing, a \\"facticity,\\" an object for others. The ambiguity is that each of us is both subject and object, freedom and facticity. As free, we have the ability to take note of ourselves and choose what to do. As factic, we are constrained by physical limits, social barriers and the expectations and political power of others. De Beauvoir rejects any notion of an absolute goodness or moral imperative that exists on its own. \\"...there exists no absolute value before the passion of man, outside of it, in relation to which one might distinguish the useless from the useful.\\" Values come only from our choices. Human freedom can be only in concrete projects, not in the abstract. Freedom \\"requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects.\\" The types of particular content that are suitable are discussed in Part III. = Part II = Part II, \\"Personal Freedom and Others,\\" examines a number of different ways that people try to deny their freedom, as freedom can be uncomfortable and disquieting. The freedom to choose entails the freedom to try to avoid one's freedom. Before we can even do that, however, we start as children, who take the values of the adults around them as ready-made things. She calls this the attitude of \\"seriousness,\\" in which the child \\"escapes the anguish of freedom\\" by thinking of values as existing objectively, outside himself, rather than as an expression of his freedom. Once past childhood, one can be a sub-man who avoids all questions of freedom and assumes himself not free. The next rung up the hierarchy is the serious man who \\"gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned,\\" in effect reverting to a kind of childhood. Both the sub-man and the serious man refuse to recognize that they are free, in the sense of being able to choose their own values. Several other types recognize their freedom, but misuse it. The nihilist, having failed at life, decides not to try anything at all. \\"Conscious of being unable to be anything, man then decides to be nothing. ... Nihilism is disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself.\\" The adventurer is one who engages vigorously in various life projects, but without caring for the goal. The adventurer \\"does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake.\\" And he tramples on others in the process: \\"[T]he adventurer shares the nihilist’s contempt for men.\\" Finally the passionate man cares enthusiastically about his goal, but shares a similar contempt for others: \\"Not intending his freedom for men, the passionate man does not recognize them as freedoms either. He will not hesitate to treat them as things.\\" And finally there is genuine freedom, which takes the excitement of the adventurer and the passion of the passionate man and includes with them a concern for other people, other freedoms, as well. \\"Passion is converted to genuine freedom only if one destines his existence to other existences ....\\" \\"To will oneself free is also to will others free.\\" = Part III = Part III, \\"The Positive Aspect of Ambiguity,\\" examines the intricacies and nuances of genuinely free action in the world. It includes five sections. :Part III, section 1, \\"The Aesthetic Attitude,\\" criticizes the attitude of detached contemplation as being unworkable. :Part III, section 2, \\"Freedom and Liberation,\\" explores the evils of oppression and offers a number of trenchant observations about the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed. The oppressor recognizes the interdependence of people, but treats those of the oppressed class as things, not as free human existents in their own right. To prevent them from rebelling, the oppressor tries to mystify them into thinking that the oppressive situation is just natural. But it is not, and \\"the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt ....\\" :Part III, section 3, \\"The Antinomies of Action,\\" examines the need for violence and its consequent moral quandaries. \\"In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries.\\" Under what circumstances, then, is violence justified? Under what circumstances may the oppressed treat the oppressors as less than fully human in order to secure their own liberation? De Beauvoir considers in some detail the nuances and difficulties of such considerations. :Part III, section 4, \\"The Present and the Future,\\" treats the relationship of action in the present to achieve an uncertain goal in the future. The determinism suggested by the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx is considered and criticized. :Part III, section 5, \\"Ambiguity,\\" returns to the originating theme of the work, that each of us is both radically free, able to transcend himself or herself, and factical, constrained by that which just is what it is. How does one remain true to one's freedom while allowing others their own freedom, even if they make mistakes? Are we justified in telling the truth when another person finds the truth unbearable? We have to act in particular situations, \\"inventing an original solution\\" each time, but remembering that \\"man is man only through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact.\\" The brief Conclusion sums up de Beauvoir's view of human freedom: \\"... we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite.\\" She ends with a call for us to realize and act on this fundamental truth of our existence.

The medical establishment in North America and the United Kingdom began forming study and discussion groups in disaster medicine. In some cases, the medical schools were on the front lines of this movement. Meanwhile, courses and fellowships in disaster medicine related fields at universities in London, Paris, Brussels, Bordeaux and the United States have been in existence since the early 1980s. Throughout this period, incomplete and faltering medical responses to disaster events made it increasingly apparent that federal, state and local emergency management organizations were in need of a mechanism to identify qualified physicians in the face of a global upturn in the rate of natural and man-made disasters. Many physicians who volunteer at disasters have a bare minimum of knowledge in disaster medicine and often pose a hazard to themselves and the response effort because they have little or no field response training. It was against this backdrop that the American Academy of Disaster Medicine (AADM) and the American Board of Disaster Medicine (ABODM) were formed for the purpose of scholarly exchange and education in Disaster Medicine as well as the development of an examination demonstrating excellence towards Board Certification in this new specialty.  History  An area of medical specialization is defined by body of unique knowledge and skills required by practitioners in that field. In the United States, reputable medical specialties are credentialed by the American Board of Medical Specialties. It is important for readers to be aware that the \\"Disaster Medicine Specialty\\" described in this article is NOT an ABMS-credentialed board, limiting its impact on the physician community. The actual ABMS specialty certification that is generally accepted as the \\"Disaster Medicine\\" credential would be the EMS subspecialty of Emergency Medicine, administered under the ABMS-accredited American College of Emergency Physicians. In February 2003, prior to formation of the AADM and ABODM, the American Association of Physician Specialists (AAPS) commissioned an expert panel to undertake a scholarly review of the literature and survey the recognized experts in disaster management, emergency management, medical contingency planning, emergency medicine, public health, disaster behavioral health and military medicine to determine if such a unique body of knowledge and skills existed. By February 2004 it was determined that the majority of experts, supported by the available literature, agreed that there is a unique body of core knowledge and skills to define the specialty of Disaster Medicine and a broader body of knowledge needed by all healthcare practitioners responding to a disaster event. From February 2004 through October, 2005 further research was compiled into a body of unique knowledge known as a Core competencies document. By January 2005, it was evident that the National Disaster Life Support Educational Consortium (NDLSEC) and the American Medical Association (AMA) were similarly compiling the body of knowledge needed by all healthcare professionals responding to a disaster. As the purpose of the Disaster Medicine Core Competencies was to define the core body of knowledge required to demonstrate proficiency in Disaster Medicine towards physician board certification in the specialty, the Disaster Medicine Core Competency document reflects that bias.  Public Board Member  On March 23, 2009, the American Board of Disaster Medicine (ABODM) announced the appointment of U.S. Marine Corps Major General James L. Williams as its Public Board Member. It is important to note that the ABPS is the first and only nationally recognized physician multispecialty certifying body that has public members on its boards of certification.

The appellation's southerly location results in more hours of sunshine than other locations in Napa Valley or nearby Green Valley. The proximity to San Pablo Bay results in a cooler climate, making Wild Horse Valley attractive for the cultivation of grapes like Pinot noir. Geography and climate The Wild Horse Valley AVA features two distinct subregions. To the west, the area is cooled by San Pablo Bay, although the elevation keeps the area above the fogline. The eastern half, being protected by the slope of the ground, is much warmer. The soil type is generally volcanic throughout the entire AVA. History Grapes were first planted in the area in the 1880s. The current vineyard plantings date back to 1980, with commercial production starting in 1985.  Wild Horse Vineyard The largest vineyard in the Wild Horse Valley AVA was the Wild Horse Vineyard of Napa Valley. Neglected crops can become places for pests to become established and then spread. The European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) larvae feed on grapes, and was first found in Napa Valley in 2009. Since then, Napa Valley has spent nearly $60 million to eradicate the moth. The recent wildfires destroyed the Wild Horse Valley vineyards.

The shipbuilder was founded in 1946 and the site was initially owned by the Government of Canada for storage purchases. The shipyard expanded to include ship repair, and reconstruction work. In 1956, the drydock was sold to the Upper Lakes Shipping Company, which began the construction of vessels at the site. The shipyard twice went insolvent, most recently in 2015. Port Weller Dry Docks was used to build, refit and repair cargo vessels. History Following the boom of shipbuilding on the Great Lakes during the Second World War, the Muir Dry Dock was closed down at Port Dalhousie, Ontario and operations were moved to the east side of the Welland Canal at Port Weller, Ontario in 1946. The drydock, opened in 1947, was initially owned by the Government of Canada and was used to store gates, lock valves, and gate-lifting vessels. The new site was considered an improvement over the Muir Dry Dock due to its location above Lock 1, which eliminated the need for pumps to fill or empty the dry dock. The yard was expanded to include ship repair and reconstruction work and employed 500 by 1950. In 1956, the yard was sold to the Upper Lakes Shipping Company. Under their management, the shipyard began to construct vessels of different types, such as bulk carriers, tankers, tugboats, scows, barges, car ferries and icebreakers. The Port Weller Dry Docks expanded its activities with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the late 1950s. By the 1990s, the Port Weller Dry Docks was the lone Great Lakes shipyard in operation in Canada. It was sold to Canadian Shipbuilding & Engineering Ltd. but later became insolvent. The shipyard was reacquired by Upper Lakes Group in 2007, along with a dockyard in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The company reorganized the shipyards, and other endeavours located in Hamilton and Port Colborne, Ontario into a new division named Seaway Marine & Industrial Incorporated. They renamed the facility Seaway Marine and Industrial Limited, but the firm went bankrupt in 2013, resulting in the closure of the shipyard and loss of jobs. The yard was used briefly in 2015 by Algoma Central to perform maintenance work on self-unloading bulk carrier and was leased by Saint Lawrence Seaway (current owner of the facility).

Grigsby was also known as both \\"A. J. Grigsby\\" and \\"Arnold J. Grigsby\\". Grigsby was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia. He attended Washington College (later, Washington & Lee University). He became a farmer and served in the Mexican War. When the Civil War erupted, he became a major in the 27th Virginia Infantry in the Stonewall Brigade in 1861 and lieutenant colonel later that year. After the regiment's commander, Col. John Echols, was wounded at Kernstown on March 23, 1862, Grigsby got command and led the regiment throughout the remainder of the Valley Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and the Northern Virginia Campaign. When Col. William Baylor, the acting commander of the Stonewall Brigade, was killed at Second Bull Run, Grigsby took over the brigade. Grigsby then led the Stonewall Brigade into the Maryland Campaign. At Antietam, Grigsby, despite being merely a colonel, succeeded to division command when Brig. Gen John R. Jones was wounded and Brig. Gen William E. Starke was killed. He was brevetted Brig. Gen. and so served, but was apparently never confirmed. After the battle was over, Stonewall Jackson named two staff officers to fill the vacated command positions. Brig. Gen Raleigh Colston got division command and Brig. Gen Elisha Paxton got command of the Stonewall Brigade. Grigsby, who had led the brigade in two major battles, felt that he fully earned a promotion to brigadier general and was outraged at Jackson demoting him back to regimental command. One theory why Grigsby was passed over for promotion was his use of profane language, which displeased the devout and sober Jackson. Grigsby resigned his commission in disgust that November. Jackson did not explain why he was not promoted, but it has been suggested that he disliked the hot-tempered, profane Grigsby and preferred instead to appoint Elisha Paxton, a somber, religious man who was close to him. Grigsby is reported to have had a testy encounter with Jefferson Davis, when he went to Richmond, Virginia, to protest being passed over for promotion. This resulted in his remaining at home, unemployed in further service, for the rest of the war. After his resignation on November 14, 1862, he served in the CSA House of Representatives for the Kentucky delegation. He died in Stony Point, Virginia, and is buried there in the Gross family cemetery.

It was founded in the early 14th century,Princely States of India A-J supposedly by a brother of the last ruler of the Kakatiya dynasty proper, Prataparudra II. It is today used to refer the same region, called Bastar district in Chhattisgarh state.Rahul Pandita. Hello Bastar: The Untold Story Of India’s Maoist Movement. Tranquebar Press (2011). .Chapter VI. p. 111 In the early 19th century the state became part of the Central Provinces and Berar under the British Raj, and acceded to the Union of India on 1 January 1948, to become part of the Madhya Pradesh in 1956, and later part of the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh state in 2000. The current ceremonial ruler is Maharaja Kamal Chandra Bhanj Deo of Bastar, of the Bhanj dynasty. Overview Bastar state was situated in the south-eastern corner of the Central Provinces and Berar, bounded north by the Kanker State, south by the Godavari district of Madras States Agency, west by Chanda District, Hyderabad State, and the Godavari river, and east by the Jeypore estate in Odisha. It had an area of and a population of 306,501 in 1901, when its capital city at Jagdalpur, situated on the banks of Indravati river, had a population of 4,762.Bastar The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1908. v. 7, p. 121 History Traditionally the area is mentioned as Dandakaranya in the epic Ramayana, and part of the Kosala Kingdom in the Mahabharata. Around 450 AD, the Bastar area was ruled by a Nala king called Bhavadatta Varman, who is recorded as having invaded the neighbouring Vakataka kingdom during the reign of its king, Narendrasena (440-460) The Vākātaka-Gupta age: Circa 200-550 A.D., by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Anant Sadashiv Altekar.Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1986. . Page 116. A brother of Prataparudra II, Annamaraja, has been associated with ruling what eventually became the state of Bastar. This appears likely to be historical revisionism, dating from a genealogy published by the ruling family in 1703, because the document records only eight generations spanning almost four centuries of rule. Such revisionism and tenuous claims of connection to the Kakatiyas was not uncommon because it was perceived as legitimising the right to rule and a warrior status. Talbot notes that there is a record of a brother called Annamadeva and that: According to this chronology, the state was established around 1324 CE and the founder established his kingdom at Bastar under the tutelage of a local goddess, Danteshwari. That goddess remains the tutelary deity of Bastar region and the Danteshwari Temple stands today at Dantewada. He ruled till 1369 when he was followed successively by Hamir Deva (r. 1369-1410), Bhaitai Deva (1410–1468), Purushottama Deva (1468–1534) and Pratapa Raja Deva (1602–1625) after which the Bastar branch of the dynasty became extinct in the third generation with Dikpala Deva (1680–1709), after which a descendant of the younger brother of Prataparaja Deva, Rajapala Deva became the next King in 1709. Rajapala Deva had two wives, first a Baghela princess, married, who had a son, Dakhin Singh, secondly, a Chandela Princess, who has two sons, Dalapati Deva and Pratap, trouble however struck again when after the death of Rajapala Deva in 1721, the elder queen ousted other claimants and placed her brother on the throne of Bastar, Dalapati Deva took refuge in the neighbouring kingdom of Jeypore and finally regained his throne a decade later in 1731.Bastar - History The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1908. v. 7, p. 122.History of Bastar Bastar district official website. Its capital was Jagdalpur, where Bastar royal palace built by its ruler, when its capital was shifted here from old capital Bastar. Later at some point in the 15th century Bastar was divided into two kingdoms, one based in Kanker and the other ruled from Jagdalpur.Gill, Simeran Man Singh. The Ghotul in Muria Society. (Singapore: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1992) p. 4 The present Halba Tribe claims to descend from the military class of these kingdoms. Until the rise of the Marathas, the state remained fairly independent until the 18th century. In 1861, Bastar became part of the newly formed Central Provinces and Berar, and in 1863, after years of feud, over the Kotapad region, it was given over to the neighbouring Jeypore state in 1863, on the condition of payment of tribute of Rs. 3,000, two-thirds of which sum was remitted from the amount payable by Bastar. By virtue of this arrangement the tribute of Bastar was, reduced to a nominal amount. Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo (1929–1966), the 20th and the last ruling head of the Bastar state, ascended the throne in 1936, before it acceded to India in 1948 during the political integration of India.Bastar (state) - History and Genealogy Queensland University.

Career =Unión Española I= Miranda began his professional career in 1996 after joining the Unión Española youth team. In 1998, he was called up to Unión Española's first team, who were then coached by Guillermo Yávar. The 1999 season marked the arrival of Juvenal Olmos as coach. He sent Miranda on loan to Ñublense, then of the Chilean Third Division, in order for him to gain first team experience. He remained there for two years until being recalled by Unión Española in preparation for their 2001 season in Primera Division. He made his first team debut for Unión Española in the 2001 season against Colo-Colo, and became a regular starter for Union for the next years. In 2004, he was named co-captain prior to the team's Apertura campaign. During the 2005 Apertura, Miranda played a key role in guiding Unión Española to the 2005 Torneo Apertura. However, Miranda had already agreed a loan to Red Bull Salzburg of Austria for the rest of the 2005-2006 European season, preventing him in partaking in the 2005 Apertura play-offs, where Unión Española won their sixth national title in team history. Miranda made only 4 appearances for Salzburg before returning to Unión Española after the season's end. In 2006, he stayed with Unión Española throughout the 2006 Apertura before being sold to rivals Universidad Católica at the start of the 2006 Clausura. =Universidad Católica= After his transfer to UC, Miranda started in 11 games in defense during the Clausura, before injuring his ACL in his right knee, an injury that would keep him out for 9 months. He would go on to miss the 2006 Torneo Clasura where Universidad Católica would bow out during the playoffs and all of the 2007 Apetura and its Torneo where Universidad Católica lost to Colo-Colo in the final. He made his return during the 2007 Clausura where he made 11 appearances, 4 from the bench. Again, UC lost in the playoffs, after which, he left the club. =Unión Española II= In the off season, Miranda returned to Unión Española where he became a fixture in the back. After the retirement of José Luis Sierra before the 2009 Apertura he was named the new club captain. The team narrowly missed out on the title that season, losing to Universidad de Chile 3-2 on aggregate in the 2009 Torneo Apertura Finals. Because of their runners up finish, Unión Española qualified for the 2009 Copa Sudamericana, where they were eliminated by Vélez Sársfield in the Round of 16 by an aggregate score of 5-4. He continued to captain the side until the end of their 2010 Clausura. =Columbus Crew= On December 24, 2010 it was first reported by La Tercera on their website that Miranda had agreed to terms with American Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew. He made his Columbus debut on February 22, 2011 in leg 1 of the Crew's CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final series against Real Salt Lake.Crew, RSL finish scoreless in testy CCL opener His first league game with the Crew was on March 19, 2011 against DC United in the season opener.

She was used by the Union Navy primarily as a ship's tender and also as a gunboat stationed off Confederate ports to prevent their trading with foreign countries. Sloop captured and converted to Union Navy service On October 16, 1862, the commanding officer of the Union steamer — Acting Lieutenant Edward Y. McCauley — ordered Acting Master Robert B. Smith to lead a reconnaissance expedition up the Apalachicola River. During the ensuing operation, Smith's boats exchanged fire with Southerners ashore and signaled for help. That gunboat's launch brought a howitzer into the fray, \\"…cleared the banks of the guerrillas,\\" and enabled the Union boats to continue on upstream. A short distance past the town of Apalachicola, Florida, Smith found a sailing ship which had grounded inside the mouth of a creek. She proved to be G. L. Brockenborough, a sloop carrying 64 bales of cotton. Her master and a single passenger were still on board. The Union sailors refloated the vessel and took her to Key West, Florida, where she was condemned by the prize court and purchased by the Navy on November 15. Civil War service =Assigned to the East Gulf Blockade as a tender= Sent back to waters off the Apalachicola, Brockenborough — also spelled Brockenboro — served the East Gulf Blockading Squadron as a tender to the double-ended sidewheeler and the former ferryboat . On February 18, 1863, while anchored off New Inlet, St. George's Sound, Somerset sighted a schooner sailing westward along the southern coast of St. George's Island; and her captain — Lieutenant Commander A. F. Crosman — sent Brockenborough in pursuit of the stranger. The armed sloop overtook and captured Hortense, a schooner bound from Havana, Cuba, for Mobile, Alabama, with an escorted cargo. Crosman manned the prize from Somerset and sent her to Key West, Florida, for adjudication, and she was condemned by the prize court there. =Attempting to tow a Confederate boat that had been sunk= On March 20, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant George E. Welch — who commanded the Union bark — sent his executive officer, Acting Master Richard J. Hoffner, in Brockenborough to the mouth of the Ocklocknee River to investigate a report that a schooner was loading cotton at that place. The sloop, accompanied by Amandas launch, struggled across the marshy waters of St. George's Sound for three days before reaching the Ocklocknee where Hoffner found \\"…a dismasted vessel lying close to [the river's] starboard bank….\\" While the Union party approached the partially sunken ship, the Southerners who had been on board escaped to shore in boats. Hoffner tried to tow his quarry back toward the sound, but the prize — the schooner Onward — was stranded by the ebbing tide some two hours later. =Attacked by Confederate cavalry, the tow is abandoned= The next morning, when Onward was again afloat, the expedition once more headed for deep water, but took the wrong channel and again struck the bottom. After strenuously, although futilely, striving to pull free, the Union sailors decided to wait for help from the rising tide. However, a short while later, some 40 mounted Confederate soldiers and about 150 Southern infantrymen arrived and attacked the expedition. Some of the bluejackets fought back with a howitzer and muskets while their companions set fire to the prize before the whole Union party withdrew in Brockenborough and the launch. Both scraped on the bottom but were kept in motion by wading sailors who dragged the boats for about half a mile over mud flats before they floated free. Confederate riflemen kept the party under fire throughout the retreat, killing one man outright and wounding eight others, including Acting Master Hoffner. Once the boats were free of the mud, they proceeded to waters off St. Mark's, Florida, where the wounded were embarked in the Union steamer . =Brockenborough beached and burned to prevent her capture= Brockenborough soon returned to St. Georges Sound and, some two months later, was within signal distance of USS Port Royal, when boats from that ship captured the cotton-laden sloop Fashion on 23 May. That night a stiff breeze from the northeast arose and the next day it began to increase steadily in intensity. By the 27th, the wind had reached hurricane intensity and had created a shoreward, current through the West Pass in St. George's Sound, threatening to drive Brockenborough ashore on the mainland where she and her crew would be at the mercy of Confederate forces. On 28 May the sloop was driven ashore by the wind and wrecked on St. George's Island where she was set afire to prevent her being recaptured by the South.

Notion is available for use on Microsoft Windows, macOS and iOS. Composition Notion allows users to perform composition using a computer keyboard/mouse, MIDI keyboard, MIDI guitar, MIDI file, MusicXML file, or handwriting recognition. The application automatically handles aspects of music notation based on the input, such as stem direction and alignment of different rhythmic values.See article by Brian Humpherson in Zone Magazine, 2008 Issue 16 Notion also supports the input and output of notation in tablature form, synchronized with the standard music notation. Notion also provides an audio mixer to set volume levels, perform panning, and add effects such as equalization, compression and reverb. From version 3 onward, Notion also supports ReWire, third-party VST effects and other third-party sound libraries, including presets for products from the Vienna Symphonic Library, EastWest, Miroslav Philharmonik, and Garritan Personal Orchestra. Playback and Performance Notion's sample library for playback was recorded at Abbey Road by the London Symphony Orchestra. The playback engine provides options for real-time tempo control as it interprets score marks, such as articulations and performance techniques.Expanded on by editor review in Computer Music, February 2008 Users can also capture playback in wav digital audio files for transfer to CD or digital audio workstation, or for conversion to other audio formats such as mp3 or wma.  Integration with Studio One  Starting with version 3.3 in 2016, the Studio One DAW (also developed by PreSonus) is integrated with Notion (version 6 and above). This integration allows the two applications to perform real-time audio and MIDI streaming (via either ReWire or PreSonus' own UCNET protocol) to transfer audio, note, track, VST and score data directly between each other. This connectivity can occur either with both applications running on the same computer, or on multiple computers connected to the same network. This integration was expanded further by Notion versions 6.4 (May 2018, following the release of the Chord track for Studio One in version 4), which allowed the transfer of chord-level information between the two applications, and 6.5 (Jan 2019), which enabled the automatic translation of drum tracks into standard percussion notation.

Spring Mountain District AVA was officially established as an American Viticulture Area in 1993. Encompassed within its bounds are about , of which about are planted to vineyards. Given the small crop yields on hillsides, the region represents less than 2% of Napa Valley wine. Currently the region has just over 30 winegrowers. The appellation sits on steep terraces of the Mayacamas Mountains that separate Napa Valley from Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa Plain. It lies in a northwestern portion of the Napa Valley above and behind the town of Saint Helena. The boundaries of the appellation extend from the top of the ridgeline on the western edge, tracing the Sonoma/Napa County border. From the ridgeline the boundaries extend down to the contour line at the eastern base of the hillside. The southern boundary is Sulphur Creek and one of its tributaries, while the northern boundary is Ritchie Creek. Elevations range from to . The region has a predominantly eastern exposure.  Climate  Local topography and regional weather patterns make the Spring Mountain District the coolest and wettest appellation within the Napa Valley. These same factors create a diurnal fluctuation in temperature in the summertime that differs from other regions of the Napa Valley. Spring Mountain is only to the east of the Pacific Ocean. The coastal waters of northern California are strongly influenced by the California Current, an icy flow of water that originates near the Aleutian Islands. This cold current moderates the summer weather in the coastal valleys of Northern California. Lying between the Spring Mountain appellation and the cold ocean current is a gap in the coastal mountains between Bodega and Tomales Bay and extending through the Santa Rosa Plain. Summer heat in the interior of California creates a low pressure area that draws cold air from the coast through this coastal gap and across the broad Santa Rosa plain. This on-shore air movement is bumped north by Sonoma Mountain pushing the cold air flow towards Santa Rosa Creek, the Northern Mayacamas Mountains, and directly at the Spring Mountain District AVA. The ridge of the Spring Mountain District is lower than Bald Mountain to its south and Diamond Mountain to its north. This lower ridgeline allows the cool, moist coastal air to enter the Napa Valley spilling down over forest and the vineyards that lie on the slopes of Spring Mountain and moderating peak daily temperatures. A typical summer afternoon on Spring Mountain is cool, sometimes with \\"waterfalls\\" of fog tumbling over the western ridge and down through the canyons of the district. Into the evening, the cool air settles to the valley floor creating a cover of fog and warm air is lifted to the higher elevations. Nighttime temperature rise from this effect. Mornings warm more quickly on Spring Mountain than on the valley floor as most of the district lies above the morning fog line. The overall effect of this is moderately warm peak daily temperatures and moderately warm nighttime temperatures which keeps sugar accumulation in the berry in pace with flavor development. The topography of the Spring Mountain District AVA also influences in the vineyards on the valley floor below it. While much of the Napa Valley depends on cooling from the San Pablo Bay, the vineyards in and around Saint Helena benefit from this second and direct source of coastal cooling that comes through the Spring Mountain District AVA. Also moderating summer temperatures in the appellation is the altitude of the vineyards; generally they are cooler at higher elevations. A final moderating influence is the district's predominantly eastern exposure which shades the district from the harsh afternoon sun. The topography influences climate over the entire year. Spring Mountain District AVA receives to more annual rainfall than the Napa Valley floor or the eastern slopes of the valley. Total precipitation can range as high as to in some of the wettest years.  Soils  Soil depths vary, but tend to be deeper than in nearby mountain terrain and shallower than on the valley floor. The region contains mostly residual upland soils with only a few areas of alluvial soils at the lower elevations. The soils are derived almost equally from Franciscan sedimentary rocks (sandstone and conglomerates) and Sonoma volcanic formations which are predominantly composed of Andesite.'Geological Guidebook of the San Francisco Bay Counties', State of California, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mines Bulletin 154, 1951, p.243. This equal mix of sedimentary and volcanic rocky soils distinguishes the region from adjacent mountain areas. To the north, in the Diamond Mountain area, soils are almost entirely of volcanic origin. To the south, in the Mount Veeder area, soils are primarily sedimentary.  Wine Production  About 90% of the wine produced in the Spring Mountain District AVA is red. The predominating grape variety is Cabernet Sauvignon followed by Merlot. In addition to the other Bordelaise grape varieties of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, a few sites favor and support small plantings of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah and on the coolest sites, even a little Pinot noir. Of the whites over half is Chardonnay. The other significant plantings of white grapes in the AVA are Sauvignon blanc and White Riesling.  History  Early on, the name Spring Mountain was used in a regional context and did not refer to the name of a peak or prominent point, rather than a particularly verdant area with numerous springs, and drained by several small streams. The appellation was among the first locations in Napa Valley to receive recognition as a grape growing region. While grapes may have been grown in the area as early as the American Civil War, the first documented planting is that of Charles Lemme, who cultivated the La Perla Vineyard just south of York Creek in 1874. Steady growth followed. In the 1880s, Jacob and Frederick Beringer, who had already opened their historic winery near St. Helena, planted a vineyard on Spring Mountain. Later in the decade, Fortune Chevalier, a Frenchman who had come to San Francisco during the Gold Rush, planted and built a stone winery. Most notable among the early growers was wealthy San Francisco banker and financier Tiburcio Parrott, who established a vineyard that he named Miravalle and built a Victorian-style home that still stands on the property. In 1893, a local newspaper reported: \\"Old vineyardists asked him [Parrott] what he expected to do among those hills and rocks, and when told by Mr. Parrott that he expected to raise grapes and produce wine unsurpassed in the world, they laughed at him and told him his hopes would never be realized.\\" Parrott's wines took first place at the San Francisco Midwinter Fair the following year and a gold medal at the World's Fair two years later. The historic La Perla, Chevalier and Miravalle vineyards are now part of Spring Mountain Vineyard. Grape growing and winemaking declined in Spring Mountain from 1910 to 1940 due to the onset of phylloxera and Prohibition. The first reawakening of viticulture came in 1946, when Fred and Eleanor McCrea planted a small vineyard north of Mill Creek, and then in 1953 founded a legendary winery called Stony Hill. The resurgence began in earnest in the late 1960s and 1970s — with the founding of several wineries, including Ritchie Creek, Yverdon, Spring Mountain Vineyard, Smith-Madrone and Robert Keenan. The name Spring Mountain was first used as an origin on Cabernet Sauvignon wines produced by Ritchie Creek in the late 1970s.

A student of Alphonso Lingis and Stanley Rosen, Frodeman works in the areas of environmental ethics and environmental philosophy, the philosophy of geology, the philosophy of science policy, and the philosophy of interdisciplinarity, and has written an extensive body of peer-reviewed academic work in these areas. Throughout his work he emphasizes the role that philosophy can play in addressing ongoing societal controversies such as acid mine drainage, global climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. His most recent work focuses on the use and abuse of knowledge for social amelioration, a topic that has come to be known as critical university studies. Frodeman is also part of a growing movement known as 'field philosophy' where philosophers emphasize working with scientists, engineers, and policy makers rather than an extensive focus on writing and working with other philosophers (e.g., Brister and Frodeman, 2020). In the fall of 2008 Frodeman became founding director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity (CSID). CSID focused on identifying best practices for interdisciplinary research and education, and views the last 100 years of disciplinarity across the academy as breaking down under the pressure of complex problems and the overproduction of knowledge. Frodeman is also the editor of the Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity (2010), second edition 2017. Biography Frodeman attended St. Louis University, where he gained degrees in History and Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University, where he obtained a Ph.D. in Philosophy, studying with Stanley Rosen and Alphonso Lingis, and the University of Colorado, where he then obtained a M.S. degree in Geology.

Arnauld was born in Paris, and was first destined for the Bar, but was taken to Rome by Cardinal Bentivoglio and during this absence, which lasted five years, the court granted him (1624) the Abbey of Saint-Nicholas. In 1637 the Chapter of Toul offered him the bishopric of Toul, and the king, at the recommendation of Father Joseph, confirmed the choice. He was obliged to wait three years for his Bulls, which were delayed by the difficulties between the court and the Holy See. He is close to some of the most famous writer of the time (Sébastien Guez de Balzac, François Maynard, etc.) and write poemsRémi Mathis, « Un Arnauld à l'hôtel de Rambouillet. Note sur un poème inconnu d'Henri Arnauld, évêque janséniste d'Angers » dans XVIIe siècle, 2008, n°4, p. 725-731. At the time of the quarrel between Pope Innocent X and the Barberini, Arnauld was sent to Rome as chargé d'affaires of France. He acquitted himself of this mission with adroitness. The pope could not deny him the return of the cardinals, who were reinstated in their possessions and dignities. He returned with the reputation of being one of the most politic prelates in the kingdom. Being offered the Bishopric of Périgueux (1650), he refused, but accepted the see of Angers in which was situated his Abbey of Saint-Nicholas. During his episcopate of forty-two years, he showed less Christian prudence than extraordinary ability in the service of the Jansenists and of his family. Having once entered on this path, he concentrated all his energies to keep from yielding, and thus to save his own honour and that of his brother Antoine Arnauld. This involved him in many difficulties, and caused many dissensions in his diocese. His entrance into the quarrel aroused by Jansenism was most exciting. When Louis XIV ordered the bishops to sign the Formulary drawn up by the Assembly of the Clergy in 1661, Arnauld as the Bishop of Angers wrote a letter to the king sustaining the famous distinction of Pierre Nicole between \\"fact\\" and \\"law\\". The king having shown marked displeasure, the bishop wrote to the pope a letter of the same import, but Pope Alexander VII made no reply. The obstinate Arnauld then wrote to Péréfixe, Archbishop of Paris, to forestall the tempest which the obligation of signing the Formulary would arouse at Port-Royal. At the same time he encouraged the religious to resist or take refuge in subtleties. Arnauld was one of the four prelates who in 1665 loftily refused to sign the Formulary of Alexander VII, and issued a mandate against it. He was about to be cited before an ecclesiastical tribunal when the pope died. Pope Clement IX, successor to Alexander VII, judged it preferable in the interests of religion to silence the whole affair. He accorded the Clementine peace to this party, and they took advantage of it. The bishop preserved his Jansenism to the end. He pursued with disfavour the partisans of orthodoxy. One should read the \\"Mémoires\\" of Joseph Grandet, third superior of the Seminary of Angers, to know to what a degree Jansenism had imbued the bishop. He was energetic, austere, devoted to his duty, and filled with zeal. In 1652, when the queen mother was approaching to inflict punishment on the city of Angers, which was in revolt, the bishop appeased her with a word. On giving her Holy Communion, he said: \\"Receive, Madame, your God, Who pardoned His enemies when dying on the Cross.\\" There is still quoted a saying of his illustrating his love of work. One day, on being requested to take a day each week for relaxation, he replied: \\"I shall willingly do so, if you give me a day on which I am not bishop.\\" He remains one of the most enigmatical figures of the seventeenth-century episcopate. The negotiations carried on by him at the Court of Rome and various Italian courts have been published in five volumes (Paris, 1745).

Due to the club's connections to St. Illtyds school the team managed to keep playing for all but two years during the Second World War. In 1966 the club were successful in gaining membership to the Welsh Rugby Union and in 1967 they moved to their new ground in Leckwith. In 2014 thanks to the work of Chairman John Manders the club secured a new long term lease on a ground in Moorland Park, Splott. This puts the club in closer proximity to its clubhouse, which is based on Splott Road.

Originally designed as a ferryboat, she was purchased by the Navy before entering commercial service and converted into a fighting vessel. During the war, she took part in the naval blockade of the Confederacy and captured a number of blockade runners. After the war, she was sold to a New York ferry company. Renamed Huntington, she operated for about two years as an East River ferry before being destroyed by fire in 1868.  Construction and design  Fort Henry was originally one of a batch of six ferryboats ordered by the Union Ferry Company for service on the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn. A wooden-hulled sidewheeler, Fort Henry was built in Brooklyn in 1861-62. She was named after a Confederate fort on the Tennessee River recently conquered by Union forces. Fort Henry was in length, with a beam of and hold depth of . She had a registered tonnage of 552, and in later naval service, a displacement of 519 long tons. Fort Henry was powered by a single-cylinder steam engine with bore of and stroke of , built by Henry Esler & Co. of New York. While the engine type is undocumented, Fort Henrys bore and stroke were identical to that of the other five ferries built at the same time for the Union Ferry Co., four of which are known to have been fitted with inclined engines. Before she could enter commercial service,Cudahy 1990. p. 341. Fort Henry was purchased by the US Navy on 25 March 1862 for the sum of $69,689.74.Daniels 1921. p. 86. After purchase, the Navy converted the vessel into a gunboat, which included fitting her with two 9-inch smoothbore cannon and four 32-pounder guns. On 3 April 1862, she was commissioned as USS Fort Henry, Acting Lieutenant J. C. Walsh in command.  Service history  Assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, Fort Henry arrived at Key West, Florida, 2 June 1862 for blockade duty in the vicinity of St. George Sound and the Cedar Keys. Highly successful in apprehending blockade runners, she took one sloop in 1862, and in 1863, took four schooners, four sloops, and one smaller craft. In April 1863, with St. Lawrence and Sagamore, she made an expedition to scour the coast between the Suwannee River and Anclote Keys. A sloop was taken off Bayport, Florida, 9 April, where the group engaged an enemy battery and set a schooner aflame with its fire. On 20 July 1863, Fort Henry sent her launch to reconnoiter the Crystal River, an expedition in which two of her men were killed by fire from the shore. She sailed north in June 1865, arriving at New York City 19 June, where she was decommissioned 8 July 1865. The following month, Fort Henry along with a number of other decommissioned US Navy ships were put up for auction at New York by Burdett, Jones & Co. On 15 August, Fort Henry was sold for $18,500, and passed into the hands of the Long Island Rail Road.Cudahy 1990. pp. 341, 446. Renamed Huntington, the vessel entered commercial service as a ferry, operating between Manhattan and Hunter's Point, Queens. While still in this service, she was burned to the waterline at Hunter's Point on 22 February 1868. Her estimated value at the time of her loss was $55,000, of which $15,000 was covered by insurance.

Mountains between India and China, Khalili Collections The Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh, (Arabic/Persian: Compendium of Chronicles) is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol Ilkhanate.Inal. p. 163. Written by Rashid-al- Din Hamadani (1247–1318) at the start of the 14th century, the breadth of coverage of the work has caused it to be called \\"the first world history\\". It was in three volumes. The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages, with versions in Persian and Arabic. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.Carey. p. 158 The lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the Ilkhanate, in the Middle East, Central Asia, Anatolia, and the Indian subcontinent. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the Khalili Collections, comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the Edinburgh University Library. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the Topkapı Palace Library in Istanbul. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent \\"one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium\\",Compendium of Chronicles, p. 9 and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the Persian miniature. Author Rashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at Hamadan, Iran into a Jewish family. The son of an apothecary, he studied medicine and joined the court of the Ilkhan emperor, Abaqa Khan, in that capacity. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty. He rapidly gained political importance, and in 1304 became the vizier of emperor and Muslim convert Ghazan. He retained his position until 1316, experiencing three successive reigns, but, convicted of having poisoned the second of these three Khans, Öljaitü, he was executed on July 13, 1318. Hamdani was responsible for setting up a stable social and economic system in Iran after the destruction of the Mongol invasions, and was an important artistic and architectural patron. He expanded the university at Rab'-e Rashidi, which attracted scholars and students from Egypt and Syria to China, and which published his many works. He was also a prolific author, though few of his works have survived: only a few theological writings and a correspondence which is probably apocryphal are known today in addition to the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh. His immense wealth made it said of him that he was the best paid author in Iran. Description \\"The conversion of Ghazan Khan to Islam\\", Timurid manuscript, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Supplément persan 1113, c. 1430 The Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh was one of the grandest projects of the Ilkhanate period, \\"not just a lavishly illustrated book, but a vehicle to justify Mongol hegemony over Iran\\".Blair and Bloom, 3 The text was initially commissioned by Il-Khan Ghazan, who was anxious for the Mongols to retain a memory of their nomadic roots, now that they had become settled and adopted Persian customs. Initially, the work was intended only to set out the history of the Mongols and their predecessors on the steppes, and took the name Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī, which makes up one part of the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh. To compile the History, Rashid al-Din set up an entire precinct at the university of Rab'-e Rashidi in the capital of Tabriz. It contained multiple buildings, including a mosque, hospital, library, and classrooms, employing over 300 workers. After the death of Ghazan in 1304, his successor Öljaitü asked Rashid al-Din to extend the work, and write a history of the whole of the known world. This text was finally completed in sometime between 1306 and 1311. After Rashid al-Din's execution in 1318, the Rab-i-Rashidi precinct was plundered, but the in-process copy that was being created at the time survived, probably somewhere in the city of Tabriz, possibly in the library of Rashid's son, Ghiyath al-Din. Later, Rashid's son became Vizier, in his own right, and expanded the restored university precinct of his father. Several of the Jāmiʿs compositions were used as models for the later seminal illustrated version of the Shahnameh known as the Demotte Shahnameh.Blair. pp. 31–32. In the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in Herat, perhaps claimed after a victory by the Timurid dynasty. It then passed to the court of the Mughal Empire in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince Farzada Kuli. This fragment was acquired by Colonel John Baillie of Leys of the East India Company, and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library. The other portion was acquired by John Staples Harriott of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General Thomas Gordon. He then bequeathed it to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at Sotheby's, where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for £850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript.Blair. p. 36 The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990. =Sources= The Battle of Badr, from Topkapi MS H 1653, 1314 To write the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh, Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified: * From Iran, it is very similar to work by Ata-Malik Juvayni, a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Tārīkh-i Jahāngushāy \\"History of the World-Conqueror\\". Also from Iran, the Shahnameh is drawn upon.Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge * For Europe, the Chronicle of the Popes and the Emperors of Martin of Opava * For the Mongols, it seems that he had access to the Altan Debter, through the ambassador of the Great Khan to the court of the Il-Khanate. * For China, the author knew the translation of four Chinese manuscripts: three on medicine and one on administration. Furthermore, it is known that he enjoyed calligraphy, painting and Chinese music. The links with this world were made all the easier because Mongols also ruled China. =Contents= The Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh consists of four main sections of different lengths: 1\\\\. The Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī, the most extensive part, which includes: :* The Mongol and Turkish tribes: their history, genealogies and legends :* The history of the Mongols from Genghis Khan up to the death of Mahmud Ghazan 2\\\\. The second part includes : :* The history of the reign of Öljaitü up to 1310 (no known copy) :* The history of the non-Mongol peoples of Eurasia (a universal history from the time of Creation, following the organization of work of the Abbasid historian al-Tabari in his History of the Prophets and Kings, often referred to as at-Tabari's HIstory, and to the historic Muslim history of Qazi Beiza'i in the Neẓām al-tawārīkh: :** Adam and the patriarchs :** the kings of the pre-Islamic Iran :** Muhammad and the Caliphs (Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid Caliphates) :** the Islamic dynasties of Persia (Ghaznavids, the shahs of Khwarezm, the Isma'ili state of Alamut) :** the Turkic peoples, :** the History of China :** Jewish history, :** Frangistan (ie., Europe, primarily the Papal States and Holy Roman Empire) :** the Indians. 3\\\\. The Shu'ab-i panjganah (\\"Five genealogies, of the Arabs, Jews, Mongols, Franks, and Chinese\\"). This text exists in two copies of the manuscript in the library of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul (ms 2937), but has only been published on microfilm. 4\\\\. The Suwar al-aqalim, a geographical compendium. Unfortunately, it has not survived in any known manuscript. =Illustrations= Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in the Muslim world in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia). Although much of the illustration for the various Tawarikh copies was probably done at the Rab-al Rashidi university complex, a contemporary written account mentions that they were also done elsewhere in Mongol empire.Bloom & Blair, Grove Enlycl., Vol. II p. 214 Mohammed exhorting his family before the Battle of Badr The scene now in the Kahlili collection illustrating the Battle of Badr used a collection of stock figures, and scholars are in disagreement as to who is represented. One descriptor says it shows Muhammad with Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ali before sending them to battle. Another says Muhammad is on the right, but Hamza and Ali on the left, or perhaps the center. Another description says it is Muhammad exhorting his family to fight, and that he may be one of the central figures, but it is not clear which one.Blair. p. 70 =Questions about work= There is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din's editorial authorship but the work is generally considered a collective effort. It may also be possible that it was compiled by a group of international scholars under his leadership. Yet, a number of questions remain about the writing of the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh. Several others, such as Abu’l Qasim al-Kashani, claimed to have written the universal history. Rashid al-Din was, of course, a very busy man, with his public life and would have employed assistants to handle the materials assembled and to write the first draft: Abu'l Qasim may have been one of them. Furthermore, not all of the work is original: for instance, the section on the period following the death of Genghis Khan in particular is directly borrowed from Juvayni. Other questions concern the objectivity of the author and his point of view: it is after all an official history, concerning events with which Rashid al-Din in his political capacity was often involved at first hand (for the history of the Ilkhanate in particular). Nonetheless, the work \\"is characterized by a matter-of-fact tone and a refreshing absence of sycophantic flattery.\\" Contemporary manuscripts Folio from the Edinburgh collection, showing a miniature painting of Mongols besieging a city. Note the elements protruding beyond the frame. The Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities.Carey, pp. 158–159 Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.Canby, 31 =Arabic manuscripts= The earliest known copy is in Arabic, dated to the early 1300s. Only portions of it have survived, divided into two parts between the University of Edinburgh (151 folios) and the Khalili Collection (59 folios), although some researchers argue for these being from two different copies. Both sections come from the second volume, with the pages interwoven. The Edinburgh part covers some of the earlier history up through a section about the Prophet Muhammad, and then this story is continued in the Khalili portion, with further narratives weaving back and forth between the two collections, ending with the final section also being in the Edinburgh collection. Edinburgh folios The Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2 cm, with a written area of 37 × 25 cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in Naskhi calligraphy. There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as \\"Baillie's collection\\". Seventy rectangular miniatures adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of Tabriz at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists. The miniatures have an unusual horizontal format and only take up about a third of the written area; this may reflect the influence of Chinese scrolls. Some parts of the surviving text are heavily illustrated and other parts not at all, apparently reflecting the importance accorded to them. The miniatures are ink drawings with watercolour washes added, a technique also used in China; although they are generally in good condition, there was considerable use of metallic silver for highlights, which has now oxidized to black. Borrowings from Christian art can also be seen; for example the Birth of Muhammad adapts the standard Byzantine composition for the Nativity of Jesus, but instead of the Biblical Magi approaching at the left there is a file of three women.Blair and Bloom, 28; Canby, 31 The section includes the earliest extended cycle of illustrations of the life of Muhammad. Like other early Ilkhanid miniatures, these differ from the relatively few surviving earlier Islamic book illustrations in having coherent landscape backgrounds in the many scenes set outside, rather than isolated elements of plants or rocks. Architectural settings are sometimes given a sense of depth by different layers being shown and the use of a three-quarters view.Min Yong Cho, 12-18 Rice distinguished four major painters and two assistants: * The Painter of Iram: the most influenced by China (reflected in Chinese elements, such as trees, interest in the landscape, interest in contemplative characters). The work is characterized by open drawing, minimal modelling, linear drapery, extensive details, stripped and balanced compositions, delicate and pale colours, and a rare use of silver. He painted mostly the early miniatures, and may have been assisted by the Master of Tahmura. * The Painter of Lohrasp: characterized by a variety of subjects, including many throne scenes, a variable and eclectic style, quite severe and angular drapery, a variety of movements, stripped and empty backgrounds. His absence of interest in landscape painting shows a lack of Chinese influences, which is compensated for by inspiration from Arab, Syrian and Mesopotamian painting. His work is of variable quality, and uses silver systematically. His assistant: the Master of Scenes from the Life of the Prophet. * The Master of the Battle Scenes: a somewhat careless painter, as becomes evident when the number of arms does not match the number of characters, or a leg is missing among the horses. He is notable for a complete lack of focus and horror, and for strong symmetry, his compositions usually comprising two parties face to face composed of a leader and two or three followers. Decoration is limited to grass, indicated in small vegetative clumps, except during sieges and attacks on the city. * The Master of Alp Arslan appears briefly, at the end of the manuscript. His style is crude and unbalanced, his characters often badly proportioned. Just as distinguishable are different racial and ethnic types, made manifest not just in the physical attributes of the characters, but also their clothes and their hats. One can thus distinguish a remarkably well observed group of Abyssinians, Western- style figures based on Syrian Christian manuscripts, Chinese, Mongols, Arabs, and so on. The Edinburgh folios were displayed at an exhibition at the University of Edinburgh Main Library in summer 2014 Khalili folios Buddha offers fruit to the devil, Khalili Collection The portion in the Khalili Collections, where it is referred to as MSS727, contains 59 folios, 35 of them illustrated. Until sold in 1980 it was owned by the Royal Asiatic Society in London. It is a different section of the History than that of the Edinburgh version, possibly from a different copy. Each page measures (slightly different dimensions to the Edinburgh portion due to different models copied). According to Blair's description of the collection, \\"Two major sections were lost after division: thirty-five folios (73-107) covering the life of Muhammad up to the caliphate of Hisham, and thirty folios (291-48) going from the end of the Khwarazmshahs to the middle of the section on China. The latter may have been lost accidentally, but the former block may have been jettisoned deliberately because it had no illustrations. The folios about the life of the Prophet were further jumbled, and four were lost. The final three folios (301-303) covering the end of the section on the Jews were also lost, perhaps accidentally, but judging from the comparable section in MS.H 1653, they had no illustrations and may also have been discarded.\\"Blair. p. 34. The manuscript was brought to Western attention by William Morley, who discovered it in 1841 while he was cataloguing the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. For some time this collection was displayed in the King's Library of the British Museum. It includes twenty illustrations, plus fifteen pages with portraits of the emperors of China. The text covers the history of Islam, the end of China's history, the history of India, and a fragment from the history of the Jews. The work of the Painter of Luhrasp and Master of Alp Arslan is again evident. Some differences in style can be observed, but these can be attributed to the difference in date. A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of Yuan mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China. The folios are dated 1314, and it was transcribed and illustrated in Tabriz under the supervision of Rashid al-Din. =Persian manuscripts= Assassin (left, in white turban) fatally stabs Nizam al-Mulk, a Seljuk vizier, in 1092, from Topkapi MS H 1653. There are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the Topkapi Palace Library, Istanbul. * MS H 1653, made in 1314, which includes later additions on the Timurid era for Sultan Shah Rukh. The full collection, known as the Majmu'ah, contains Bal'ami's version of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's chronicle, the Jāmiʿ al- tawārīkh, and Nizam al-Din Shami's biography of Timur. The portions of the Jāmiʿ cover most of the history of the Muhammad and the Caliphate, plus the post-caliphate dynasties of the Ghaznavids, Saljuqs, Khwarazmshahs and Is'mailis, and the Turks. It contains 68 paintings in the Ilkhanid style. * MS H 1654, made in 1317, which includes 118 illustrations, including 21 pages of portraits of Chinese emperors. It was copied for Rashid al-Din, and like H 1653 was later owned by Shahrukh.Blair. pp. 27–28, and note 35. =Later versions and manuscripts= Folio from the Jami' al-tawarikh. _Jonah and the Whale_. (Compendium of Chronicles) ca. 1400. Attributed to Iran. Interest in the work continued after the Ilkhans were replaced as Persia's ruling dynasty by the Timurids. Timur's youngest son, Shahrukh, who ruled the eastern portion of the empire from 1405–47, owned incomplete copies of the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh and commissioned his court historian Hafiz-i Abru to complete it. The earliest dated manuscript made for Shahrukh includes the original text and additions by Hafiz-i Abru, along with other histories, and is dated 1415-16 (Topkapi Palace Library, MS B 282). The Topkapi MS H 1653, discussed above, combines an incomplete Ilkhanid Jāmiʿ with Timurid additions, which are dated 1425. Another Jāmiʿ is in Paris (BnF, Supplément persan 1113), dated to about 1430, with 113 miniatures. Most of the miniatures for these volumes copy the horizontal format and other features of the Ilkhanid manuscripts, while retaining other features of Timurid style in costume, colouring and composition, using what is sometimes known as the \\"Historical style\\".Blair and Bloom, 58 and notes See also * Persian literature * Islamic art * Depictions of Muhammad * List of most expensive books and manuscripts Notes References * \\"Rashid al-Din Tabib\\", in Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, 1960 (2nd edition) * Allen, Terry, Byzantine Sources for the Jāmiʿ al- Tawārīkh of Rashīd Al-Dīn, 1985, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 15, pp. 121–136, * S.

He studied botany at the University of Copenhagen from 1911 under the professors Eugenius Warming, Christen C. Raunkiær, L. Kolderup Rosenvinge og W. Johannsen. He took his Ph.D. from the same university in 1930. From 1934 to 1960, he was superintendent at the Botanical Museum of the University of Copenhagen. Hagerup’s scientific works concern evolution, polyploidy and pollination, among other things. He showed that the tetraploid Empetrum hermaphroditum is a separate species from the diploid Empetrum nigrum. He thereby initiated the use of chromosome numbers in systematic botany, a field later known as cytotaxonomy. He put forward the hypothesis that the ploidy level is an important factor in the distribution and ecology of plant species. In contrast, another of his scientific ideas has been disproven by later modern research – the idea of a direct ancestry of the centrosperms (approximately equal to Caryophyllales) from the gymnospermous Gnetophyta and, hence, two separate evolutionary lineages within the flowering plants. Many of Hagerup’s studies were concerned with plant species of the Ericaceae, Empetraceae and related families, or ’’Bicornes’’ as they were known in the Wettstein system. The cranberry Oxycoccus hagerupii (Ericaceae) was named to his honour by Á. & D. Löve (later transferred to Vaccinium by Hannu Ahokas as Vaccinium hagerupii. Scientific works *Hagerup, O.

Formed in 2006, the band consists of Scott Butler, Landon Thompson and John Aldridge. Scott, Landon, and John met while attending college in Nashville, Tennessee. Billy Potts joined the band in January 2008 after their debut album had already been recorded. The band was discovered at SXSW in 2007 by Talking Heads and Modern Lovers member, Jerry Harrison. Harrison offered to produce the band's debut LP at his personal studio in Sausalito, CA and it was released in 2008. Since the band played to sequenced drum tracks at that time, Harrison recruited Steve Ferrone to play live drums on the recordings. Since then, they've played festivals such as CMJ Music Festival, Fun Fun Fun Fest, Austin City Limits Music Festival, MIDEM, Wireless Festival. The band’s song, “Power to Change,” has received a fair amount of national attention via modern rock and college stations. \\"Power to Change\\" was awarded Song of the Year at the 2009 Austin Music Awards. The band received a total of five honors including Best New Band, Best Bassist and Best Rock Band. They released the follow-up to their Jerry Harrison (Talking Heads and Modern Lovers) produced debut on November 16, 2010. Also, in 2010 their song \\"To Modern Science\\" was used in a notable hoax featuring a fake commercial for the next generation of Apple's iPhone; the fake ad accumulated close to a million views across the internet. On January 21, 2014 the band released their first new album since 2010 on Modern Outsider Records. The album was produced by Danny Reisch at Good Danny's in Austin, Texas.

Early life Hooker was born on October 28, 1766 to Samuel Hooker (1745–1832) and Rachel Hinds, the eldest of at least six children. His father is said to have brought his family to live in Albany in 1772 from Massachusetts. Career In the New York City directories of 1792 and 1793, he was listed as a \\"house carpenter\\" where he likely learned architecture from European architects and engineers who were working in the City. Hooker assembled a library during this period and when his parents and the rest of his family moved to Utica in 1797, he stayed behind in Albany. He became a prominent member of Albany serving as alderman assessor, city architect, city superintendent, and city surveyor. During his career, he designed Hyde Hall, the facade of the Hamilton College Chapel, The Albany Academy, Albany City Hall, and the original New York State Capitol building. He is believed to have designed the Gen. John G. Weaver House at Utica, New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. =Notable buildings= An existing National Register of Historic Places building that he designed, with John H. Lothrop, is: *Hamilton College Chapel on the Hamilton College campus. Two other National Register of Historic Places that are also National Historic Landmarks which he designed are: *Hyde Hall, at Otsego Lake *Roscoe Conkling House, in Utica, New York Others: * New York State Arsenal (1799; razed) * St. Peter's Episcopal Church (1802; razed 1859) * New York State Bank (1803; portions of front elevation survive) * Bank of Albany (1809; rzed) * Mechanics and Farmers Bank (1811; portions reused in receiving vault, Glenmont) * Aiken House, Rensselaer, New York (1816) * St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (1829; razed) * Albany City Hall (1832, destroyed by fire in 1880) =Private residences= He also designed many private residences for wealthy Albanians including the Van Rensselaers, Cornings, Pruyns, Lansings, William James and others.

Biography  The Bourgeois Gentleman as Monsieur Jourdain His father Sait Ömer Bey was a Cypriot businessman, while his mother Nimet Rüştü Hanım was the daughter of a pasha from Istanbul. His family settled in Şişli before Dormen's first birthday. He had his first acting experience on stage as a junior high school student at the Galatasaray High School, portraying a character in a play titled Demirbank. He finished his education at the Robert College.Graduates in the News, Robert College, 1 March 2005, 2nd page. Retrieved 30 September 2009. At the age of eight, his left foot was injured due to an accident. For his theater education, he went to the USA and studied at Yale University. He graduated with a master's degree. For two years, he worked as an actor and director in various theaters in the United States. He performed in 4 plays in Pasadena Playhouse in Hollywood. When he returned to Istanbul, he entered the Küçük Sahne stage under the direction of Muhsin Ertuğrul and had his first role in front of the Turkish audience with the play Cinayet Var. On the night of 22 August 1955, he performed in the first play organized by the Dormen Theater in the Süreyya cinema. He continued to appear in the plays at the Küçük Sahne Theater after receiving an offer by them in September 1957. In 1957, he founded the Dormen Theater with the comedy play Papaz Kaçtı. He gave roles to dozens of artists in his plays, including Erol Günaydın, Altan Erbulak, Metin Serezli, Nisa Serezli, Erol Keskin, İzzet Günay, Yılmaz Köksal, and Ayfer Feray. The party had their golden period between the years 1957-1972. In 1961, he brought the first Western-themed musical on stage in Turkey under the title Street Girl İrma.

Ribera held appointments as Archbishop and Viceroy of Valencia, Latin Patriarchate of Antioch, Commander in Chief, president of the Audiencia, and Chancellor of the University of Valencia. He was beatified in 1796 and canonized by Pope John XXIII in 1960. Biography Juan de Ribera's father was Pedro Afán de Ribera, Viceroy of Naples and Duke of Alcala. His mother died when he was very young. Ribera studied at the University of Salamanca. Ordained as priest in 1557, Pope Pius IV appointed him Bishop of Badajoz on 27 May 1562 at the age of 30. There he dedicated himself to teaching the catechism to Roman Catholics and counteracting Protestantism. He was appointed as the Archbishop of Valencia on 3 December 1568. In 1599 he ordained Alfonso Coloma as Bishop of Barcelona. King Philip III of Spain later appointed him Viceroy of Valencia in 1602, and thus he became both the religious and the civil authority. In this role he founded the Museum of the Patriarch, known among Valencians as the College of Saint John, entrusted to the formation of priests according to the spirit and the dispositions of the Council of Trent. =Expulsion of the Moriscos= Juan de Ribera in the expulsion of the Moriscos by Francisco Domingo Marqués. As Archbishop, Ribera dealt with the issue of Valencia's large morisco population, descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity at threat of exile. The moriscos had been kept separate from the main population by a variety of decrees that prohibited them from holding public office, entering the priesthood, or taking certain other positions; as a result, the moriscos had maintained their own culture rather than assimilated. Some of them did, in fact, still practice forms of crypto-Islam.Lynch, p. 43. Ribera despised the moriscos as heretics and traitors, a dislike he shared with much of Valencia's Christian populace.Lynch, p. 44. With the Duke of Lerma, Ribera helped convince Philip III to at least expel the moriscos instead. Ribera helped sell the plan by noting that all the property of the moriscos could be impounded to provide money for the treasury. In 1609, the expulsion of the moriscos from Spain was decreed. Ribera's original proposal was in fact more extreme: he favored enslaving the entire morisco population for work in galleys, mines, and abroad. Ribera said that Philip III could do so \\"without any scruples of conscience,\\" but this proposal was rejected. If the moriscos were to be expelled, Ribera favored enslaving and Christianizing at least the children of the moriscos \\"for the good of their souls\\" and exiling the parents. This was also rejected, though children under 16 years of age who wished to remain in Spain were allowed, an offer very few took.Lynch, p. 46. Canonization Efforts to canonize Ribera, who himself had been active in attempting to canonize Ignatius of Loyola, began shortly after his death.Between Christians and Moriscos, by Benjamin Ehlers Two concerns were raised about his possible sainthood: his failure to hold a provincial council as mandated by the Council of Trent, and his role in the expulsion of the Moriscos. His supporters played up Ribera's adherence to other parts of the Council of Trent, and tried to present the Moriscos as unconvertible (\\"[His conversion attempts] had no more effect on the moriscos as if they had been stones\\"). Still, efforts proceeded apace, with various admiring biographies (vidas) of Ribera being published. Ribera was beatified in 1796. In 1960, his canonization was completed under the auspices of Pope John XXIII.

Her father's favourite daughter, Marie Anne was widowed in 1685 aged 19. She never married again and had no children. Following her mother's retirement to a convent, Marie Anne continued to reside at her father's court and was later her mother's heiress. She later became the Duchess of La Vallière in her own right. Biography =Birth and infancy= Louis, by Louis-Édouard Rioult. Born secretly at the Château de Vincennes outside Paris on 2 October 1666 while the court was in residence, Marie Anne was the eldest illegitimate child of King Louis XIV. Considered by some as the king's most beautiful daughter, she would become his favourite female child. His favourite child, however, was her younger half- brother, Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine. She and her younger brother Louis de Bourbon (later Count of Vermandois) were put in the care of Madame Colbert, the wife of Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. They were raised by Madame Colbert away from the intrigues of the Court. The following year, Marie Anne was legitimised by her father on 14 May 1667. On the same day, her mother was given the titles of Duchess of La Vallière and of Vaujours with letters patent. Marie Anne would succeed to her mother's La Vallière title. During her youth, she was known as Mademoiselle de Blois, a style that was later granted to her younger half-sister, Françoise Marie de Bourbon, youngest daughter of the king by Madame de Montespan. =Marriage= On 16 January 1680, Marie Anne married her cousin, Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, in the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He had fallen in love with her at first sight. Her dowry was one million livres. The marriage was the first between a Prince of the Blood and one of Louis XIV's legitimised daughters which caused a scandal at the time. After a disastrous wedding night, the marriage remained sterile and Marie Anne shocked the court when she openly stated that her husband was not good at making love. Marie Anne de Conti refusing the marriage proposal on behalf of Moulay Ismaïl, King of Morocco (French school of the 17th century). In 1683, she lost her beloved brother the Count of Vermandois, who shared the same birthday with her. The young count had been exiled from court after being involved in a homosexual scandal involving the Chevalier de Lorraine, himself the long term lover of Marie Anne's uncle the Duke of Orléans. From all sources, Marie Anne was quite upset by her brother's death, while, according to contemporary accounts, the young man's parents did not even shed a tear. In 1685, her husband contracted smallpox from Marie Anne. Although she recovered, he succumbed after five days. After his death, she was called Madame la Princesse Douairière, and also la Grande Princesse de Conti. She never remarried and even refused an offer of marriage from the Sultan of Morocco, Ismail Ibn Sharif preferring to be free. During the five years of her marriage to the Prince of Conti, a Prince of the Blood, she was one of the most important ladies at her father's court. Her younger half sister Louise Françoise de Bourbon, the elder legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, however, made a more important marriage in 1685 to Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Bourbon, who was the eldest son of the Prince of Condé and heir to the title. As the Conti line descended from the Condé's, the latter took precedence over the former and as such Marie Anne had to yield precedence to a sister seven years her junior. This matter of etiquette, so important at Versailles, led to friction between the two. In 1698, there might have been a proposal from her nephew, Philippe of France, Duke of Anjou. He later became the King of Spain and married twice to Marie Louise of Savoy and then Elisabeth Farnese. The situation of rank at Versailles grew more irritating to Marie Anne in 1692. In that year, Louise Françoise's full sister, Françoise Marie de Bourbon married the Duke of Chartres, Philippe d'Orléans, a petit- fils de France (grandson of France) by birth and heir to the House of Orléans. On her marriage, Françoise Marie assumed the rank of petite-fille de France, giving her precedence over both Marie Anne and Louise Françoise. In addition, she was given a dowry of 2 million livres, a much higher amount than what either of her sisters had received on her marriage. These developments greatly irritated both Marie Anne and Louise Françoise who were openly hostile to their younger sister who deliberately flaunted her position much to their annoyance. =Princesse Douairière= In order to differentiate between them at court after the death of the various Princes of Conti, their widows were given the name of Douairière (dowager) and a number corresponding to the time of their widowhood, their full style thus being Madame la Princesse de Conti 'number' Douairière. Between 1727 and 1732, there were three widowed Princesses de Conti: *Marie Anne de Bourbon (1666–1739), the illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière; the wife of Louis Armand I de Bourbon, prince de Conti, became Madame la Princesse de Conti Première Douairière as she was the first to be widowed in 1685. The title went to husband's younger brother, François Louis, Prince of Conti. *Marie Thérèse de Bourbon (1666–1732), the wife of François Louis, Prince of Conti; she became 'Madame la Princesse de Conti Seconde Douairière after losing her husband in 1709. *Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon (1693–1775), the wife of Louis Armand, Prince of Conti, the son and successor of François Louis, Prince of Conti. She was the daughter of Monsieur le Duc and Madame la Duchesse. After her husband died in 1727, she became known as Madame la Princesse de Conti Troisième/Dernière Douairière. From her staff at Versailles, Marie Anne introduced her older half brother, the Dauphin, to his second wife, Émilie de Choin. He married her morganatically after the death of his first wife, the unattractive Dauphine Marie Anne Victoire (1660–1690). One day, coming upon Marie Anne Victoire's sleeping form, Marie Anne commented that she was as ugly asleep as she was awake; whereupon the dauphine awoke and retorted that she did not \\"have the advantage of being a love child.\\" Infanta Marie Anne Victoire, fiancée of Louis XV, who was put in Marie Anne's care in 1721–1725 In 1710, Marie Anne's mother died in Paris at the Carmelite convent she had entered in 1674 under the name of Sister Louise of Mercy. Marie Anne thus acquired the title duchesse de La Vallière and inherited her mother's substantial fortune which had been accumulated over the past thirty-six years. In 1713, the Princess of Conti bought the Hôtel de Lorges on the rue Saint- AugustinRue Saint Augustin in Paris, but did not start living there until 1715, and in 1716, the Château de Choisy. Both properties remained in her possession until her death. In 1718, she was presented by the Crown the Château de Champs-sur-Marne, which she later gave to her first cousin, the duc de La Vallière in order to settle some debts. Years later, it was leased for several years by Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Also in 1713, Marie Anne helped secure the marriage of her nephew, Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, with her niece, Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, the daughter of her younger half-sister, Louise Françoise. Marie Anne was renowned for her beauty, even at an older age. She was very close to her father, and got on very well with her older brother, Monseigneur, the Grand Dauphin, whom she often visited at his country estate, the château de Meudon. His death in 1711 left her quite distressed. It was at Meudon that Marie Anne met and fell in love with the young but very poor Count of Clermont-Chaste. He joined the court and benefited from his intimacy with Marie Anne. The couple exchanged love letters, but a swift exile was ordered for Clermont-Chaste when Louis XIV discovered the liaison (possibly from his daughter-in-law, Émilie de Choin). Upon the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, a regency was established and her brother-in-law, the Duke of Orléans was named as regent (1715–1723). In 1721, Marie Anne was made responsible for the education of Louis XV's future bride, the Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, who arrived in France at the age of three. The young Infanta was nicknamed l'Infante-reine ('the Queen- Infanta'). However, because of the infanta's age, the marriage did not take place and the little girl was sent back to Spain four years later, in 1725, an event which caused friction between her father King Philip V of Spain and the youthful Louis XV. After the departure of the seven-year-old Infante-reine, Marie Anne then retired from court and spent her remaining years residing on her various estates. Marie Anne was a first cousin one generation removed of the famous bibliophile, Louis César de La Baume Le Blanc, duc de La Vallière who later inherited her fortune and titles. The Princesse Douairière died of a brain tumor, in Paris, on 3 May 1739.

They are frequently used as part of a much larger logistical system in a distribution center, warehouse or trucking terminal facility. By knowing exactly how much space a parcel, object or pallet will occupy, warehouses and shipping companies are able optimize the space available to them.  History  Dimensioners first appeared on the market in 1985 when a Norwegian company named Cargoscan saw a gap between carriers' income and their potential income and began producing dimensioning and data capture solutions for companies all over the world. Since then, automated dimensioning solutions produced by different manufacturers have come to market. Today, companies such as Tricolops and its RapidSize Dimensioner, Mettler Toledo (acquired Cargoscan in 2000), BeeVision, Magaya, FreightSnap, Cubiscan, ExpressCube, Qubevu, Cind, Cargometer and others produce cubing and dimensioning equipment for the logistics and transport industries. There are various technologies used in dimensioning devices varying from point distance sensors to 3D-cameras.  Types of Dimensioning Equipment  = Large Freight Dimensioners = Also known as pallet dimensioners, these large devices obtain accurate measurements of palletized or crated freight and are primarily used by shippers and freight forwarders in pick/pack operations on the outbound shipping side, and by freight carriers in the receiving area at hubs and terminals. Large dimensioners can be paired with weighing scales, barcode scanners, and 2D cameras to capture the complete load characteristics of a shipment. These complete systems are known as Dimensioning/Weighing/Scanning systems (DWS), and will create a shipment record containing the dimensions and other freight properties captured. = Package Dimensioners = Used to measure individual boxes, cartons and packages of various shapes and sizes, package dimensioners, also known as parcel dimensioners, are often found in warehousing and distribution center facilities. They work in the same manner as larger systems and can be installed as stand-alone units or as part of larger, automated systems where conveyors and sorting systems distribute high volumes of objects to a variety of locations based on their weight and dimensions.  Trade Certifications  Where dimensioners are used for billing or trade-related activity, as is the case in parcel and less-than-truckload (LTL) freight transportation operations, dimensioners must carry legal-for-trade certification in the country of operation.

Biography Jessen was born at Frederiksberg, Denmark. He was a student at the University of Copenhagen and was awarded cand.mag. in natural history and geography with botany as a major in 1911. He was state geologist 1917–1931. In 1931, he succeeded C.H. Ostenfeld as professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Copenhagen Botanical Garden, a position he held until his retirement in 1955. His scientific works mainly concern vegetation history during the Eemian interglacial, the late glacial period of the Wisconsin glaciation and in the Holocene investigated using pollen analysis. Jessen had come into contact with the Irish naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger and made field-work on the quaternary geology of Ireland during 1934-1935. Together with his assistant, Frank Mitchell, he was able to describe both the post-glacial vegetation development of Ireland and that of the Eemian interglacial, with the presence in Ireland of such plants as Rhododendron ponticum, Abies alba, Erica scoparia and Buxus sempervirens. Jessen was acknowledged by honorary doctorates at the University of Cambridge and University of Dublin.

Commissioned as one of the youngest generals during World War II, he achieved the rank of lieutenant general before his mandatory retirement from the army in 1964. Davidson served as the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy from 1956 to 1960. He also played and coached football at West Point, helming the Cadet squad as head coach from 1933 to 1937, compiling a record of 35–11–1. Education and early military career Davidson was born in the Bronx, New York City on April 24, 1904, the son of a New York National Guard officer. In 1923, he graduated from the prestigious Stuyvesant High School in New York City, where he was a star on the school's championship football team and a member of the Omega Gamma Delta fraternity. Davidson realized his boyhood dream of becoming a soldier when he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. There, he distinguished himself in football and graduated with the Class of 1927. Upon graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware, and maintained a West Point connection as an assistant Army football coach. In 1930, Davidson returned to West Point as a philosophy instructor and assistant football coach. In 1933, at age 29, he became youngest head football coach at the academy, finishing five seasons later in the 1937 with a record of 35 wins, 11 losses and 1 tie. From 1938 to 1940 he was posted to Hawaii as a company commander with the 3rd Engineer Regiment. In 1940, he returned to California as the post engineer for Hamilton Army Airfield (now known as Hamilton Air Force Base) on the north shore of the San Francisco Bay. At the time of Davidson's arrival, Hamilton's mission was being expanded from that of a bomber base with the addition of six squadrons of Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighter planes. World War II In February 1942, Davidson transferred to Washington, D.C. as Assistant Chief, Construction Division, Office of Chief Engineer working for Colonel Leslie Groves on the construction of The Pentagon. By October 1942, Davidson was a colonel and assistant chief engineer for the Western Task Force of Operation Torch of the Allied North Africa under the command of General George S. Patton. As 1st Armored Division moved to invade Sicily in June 1943, it was activated into Seventh United States Army, and Davidson became its chief engineering officer. As a combat engineer, he facilitated Seventh Army's landing in Sicily and enabled Patton's armor to move rapidly across enemy territory. An appreciative Patton used one of his own general stars to honor Davidson in a September 1943 battlefield promotion to brigadier general, one of the youngest of the war at age 39. Davidson remained with Seventh Army under its interim command by General Mark W. Clark then General Alexander Patch and was key in planning for Operation Anvil / Operation Dragoon, the Allied landing in southern France following the D-Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944. He continued with the Seventh Army in its move through Germany. At the conclusion of the war he was an engineer with the post-war occupation Fifteenth United States Army and served as president of the first Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal for military defendants. Korean War After World War II, in 1946, Davidson was assigned to Sixth United States Army as its chief engineer and in 1948 became chief of staff for General Mark W. Clark and General Albert C. Wedemeyer at the Presidio of San Francisco. In July 1950, he was called to Korea by Eighth United States Army Commanding General Walton H. Walker, who also served under Patton in World War II, directed Davidson to construct a defensive line protecting the Pusan Perimeter. Known as \\"Line Davidson\\", Davidson had to subvert his professional better judgment to construct the line to the preferences of General Douglas MacArthur and Walker, trading away defensibility and good internal communications. As the North Korean invasion was repelled, Davidson was assigned to the 24th Infantry Division as its assistant commander. Davidson reprised his effort at fortifying a more defensible perimeter around Pusan with the second North Korean invasion. He then headed \\"Task Force Davidson\\" as it broke out of the perimeter to hook up with the forces invading south from Inchon. Afterwards, he constructed fortifications north of Seoul. He concluded his tour of duty as acting commander of the Korean Military Assistance Group. Military educator and Cold War warrior Returning from Korea, from 1951 to 1954 Davidson was the senior ground forces advisor in the Weapons System Evaluation Group at the Pentagon and while there was promoted to major general in 1952. During the next six years, Davidson played a significant role in training officers serving in the post-war and atomic eras. Starting in 1954 he was commander of the United States Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, then in 1956 he returned to the United States Military Academy as its superintendent. There he began a process of slowly prevailing over strong traditionalist viewpoints, breaking barriers and initiating a process of revision and modernization of the academy's instructional program little changed since the academy's legendary superintendent Sylvanus Thayer from 1817 to 1833. The momentum and progress of his reforms continued more easily through the superintendency of his successor, William Westmoreland and into the 1970s. In 1957, while at West Point, he was promoted and confirmed to the rank of lieutenant general. After West Point, Davidson returned to Seventh United States Army as its commanding general, posted in West Germany as a forward deployed force during the Cold War. During the Berlin Wall crisis in the summer of 1961, Davidson would have commanded any American military response or intervention. In 1962, Davidson's final command was of First United States Army, headquartered at Fort Jay, Governors Island, New York. While there he also served as United States Military Representative to the United Nations. After a 37-year military career, Davidson reached the mandatory retirement age and retired from active duty on April 30, 1964. Retirement Davidson moved to California and served as a vice president at University of California, Berkeley. He resumed his connection with West Point from 1983–1985 when he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan for a two-year term to the United States Military Academy Board of Visitors. Davidson died in Oakland, California on December 25, 1992 and was buried at the West Point Cemetery. The inscription on his gravestone reads: \\"Soldier, Coach, Educator and His Best Teammate\\", the latter reference to his wife of 58 years, Verone Gruenther Davidson who died in 1996 and was the sister of a former NATO commander, General Alfred M. Gruenther. At the time of his death, Garrison was survived by three sons, Garrison Holt Jr., of Los Angeles, Thomas M., of Darien, Conn., and Alan R., of Sarasota, Fla.; three daughters, Linda L. Hurst, of San Luis Obispo, California, Bonnie Elaine Bardellini and Gail Marie Davidson, both of Martinez, California; 14 grandchildren, and 2 great- grandchildren.

After Rick decides to spend a month away from her on a business trip, Barbi decides their marriage is over. Sheila informs her that Mark has also left her, and the two decide to live the single life. While wearing risqué outfits, Barbi and Sheila are picked up by a madam who offers to arrange sexual encounters and dates for them. Barbi decides to go by the name Viva, after the name of an erotic magazine she enjoys reading. As Viva, Barbi goes on several arranged dates and has sexual encounters with various men. She meets photographer Clyde, but refuses to sleep with him until she is ready. However after performing at an orgy, Clyde drugs and then rapes Viva.

Cast * Anna Biller as Viva * Jared Sanford as Mark Campbell * Bridget Brno as Sheila Campbell * Chad England as Rick * Marcus DeAnda as Clyde * John Klemantaski as Arthur * Paolo Davanzo as Elmer * Barry Morse as Sherman * Cole Chipman as Reeves * Robbin Ryan as Agnes Production Anna Biller's concept for Viva originally started as a photo series inspired by old Playboy magazines, and the photos inspired her to create a story surrounding these characters. Another big inspiration was Luis Buñuel's film Belle de Jour. Biller used the photos as a proof-of-concept, and was able to secure the full funding to make a feature film from a private investor. The film was made slowly as they had to repeatedly pause production to raise more money. They originally budgeted for $100,000, but the final cost of the film was $750,000. Principal photography lasted from 2005 to 2007. Biller chose to star in the film herself because she \\"wouldn't ask another actress to take off her clothes in the movie and do all these things with the power trip being 'I'm the director, you're the actress.'\\" Release Viva premiered at the 36th International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2007. It was also entered into the main competition at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. The film had a limited theatrical release by Vagrant Films Releasing; it played at Cinema Village in New York as well as in New Orleans, Cleveland, and Los Angeles. Viva was released on DVD by Cult Epics and Anchor Bay Entertainment on Feb. 24, 2009. Reaction The film has received mixed to positive reactions, and \\"illustrates cinema’s unique ability to blend high and low culture.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 48 reviews.

It can refer to a wide variety of cheeses, including the grana cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano (at right) and various others. Many types are commonly used in the production of processed cheese, especially American cheese, which by law must consist of Cheddar cheese, Colby cheese, cheese curd, or granular cheese.United States Standards for Grades of Bulk American Cheese Food and Drug Administration standards In the United States, the FDA mandates certain qualifications for something to be called granular cheese. The maximum allowed moisture content is 39 percent, and the minimum allowed milkfat content is 50 percent by weight of the solids. Regular granular cheese must either use pasteurized dairy products or be cured for at least 60 days at a temperature of at least 35 °F. Either cows' milk or cream may be used as the main ingredient. Other permissible ingredients include clotting enzymes such as rennet, coloring, calcium chloride as a coagulation aid, enzymes used in curing, hydrogen peroxide, and agents used to protect against fungi.Code of Federal Regulations: Title 21--Food and Drugs Part 133 Cheese and Related Cheese Products The name granular cheese can encompass many types of cheeses; for example, Parmigiano-Reggiano is a granular cheese.Cook's Thesaurus - Semi-Firm Cheeses Granular cheese for manufacturing must meet all of these standards except that it does not need to be cured, nor do the dairy ingredients used need to be pasteurized. This is the type of granular cheese most commonly used for processing. Production Although granular cheese can be created using any method that achieves the designated standard for physical and chemical properties, there is one method that is generally used. First, the milk or cream may be warmed and treated with hydrogen peroxide and catalase, producing water and oxygen gas. Then, a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture is added, and the product is treated with clotting enzymes to form a semisolid mass. This mass is cut, stirred, and heated to separate the curd and the whey. Increasing the amount of time between cutting and heating will increase both the final moisture content and the milkfat content of the cheese, thereby increasing the yield. There follows an alternating cycle of draining of the whey and stirring. After most of the whey has been drained, the curd is salted, drained, and pressed into the desired form. The remaining product may be cured if the original dairy products were not pasteurized. A common method of curing is to dry the cheese on racks for about a week, then to wax it and place it in coolers until the time of consumption. Taste Granular cheese is rich and tangy. Although unpasteurized granular cheese is ready to eat after 60 days of curing, it has a very mild flavor unless aged further to increase sharpness. The cheese is sharpest after 12 months of aging, after which it is usually sold. Granular cheese can contain cheese crystals, semi-solid to gritty crystalline spots.

A nurse, she co-founded the tribe's first newspaper in 1956, the Seminole News, later replaced by The Seminole Tribune, for which she served as editor, winning a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native American Journalists Association. In 2001 she published her memoir, entitled A Seminole Legend. Tiger was the first Florida Seminole to learn to read and write English, and the first to graduate from high school and a nursing program. In addition to serving as editor of the newspaper, she was Communications Director for the tribe. Early life and education Born Betty Mae Tiger on April 27, 1923, in a Seminole camp near Indiantown, Florida, she was the daughter of Ada Tiger, a Seminole woman of the Snake clan, and a French trapper, Abe Partan. Her grandmother Mary Tiger picked her Seminole name of Potackee. Under the Seminole matrilineal kinship system, Betty Mae was given her mother's surname. The tribe so discouraged intermarriage with whites that sometimes they left half-breed children in the Everglades to die. When Betty Mae was five, some Seminole medicine men threatened to put her and her younger brother to death, because their father was white. Her great-uncle resisted the men and moved the family to the Dania reservation in Broward County, where the government protected the children.Interview, p. 4 At the time, her mother had to leave nearly 500 head of cattle; she sold some and offered others to the tribe for people who needed food.Interview, p. 11 Betty Mae's first languages were Mikasuki and Creek, as relatives spoke both. At night she often listened as older members of the tribe told stories passed down from their ancestors. \\"The stories taught you how to live,\\" she said. She would later record the stories for future generations. Tiger decided she had to learn how to read and write. In the segregated school system of Florida, neither the white nor the black schools would accept Seminole children. Tiger decided to go to a federal Indian boarding school, and enrolled at one in Cherokee, North Carolina, along with her cousin Mary and younger brother. She started learning English at age 14. She became the first formally educated Seminole of her tribe, as well as the first to read and write English; she graduated from high school in 1945. Betty Tiger enrolled in a nursing program at the Kiowa Indian Hospital in Oklahoma, which she completed the following year. The Seminole then were still very traditional, and many would only accept care from Medicine Men. Her family had roles as medicine people: her mother, uncles and great-uncle Jimmy. Unlike the Medicine Men, her mother was willing also to accept white doctors and hospitals, whatever would help sick people.Interview, p. 7 Marriage and family After finishing the nursing program, Tiger returned to Florida, where she did field training. She married Moses Jumper, and they had a son Moses and two daughters, who died young. After that, they adopted two Seminole children, Boettner Roger and Scarlet.Interview, pp. 14-15 Career Betty Tiger Jumper worked as a nurse for 40 years to improve health care in the Seminole community, initially traveling a large circuit to the various small communities of the areas that became Big Cypress, Brighton and Hollywood reservations. \\"As the people came out of the swamps\\", as she said, she and another nurse inoculated many children with vaccinations for the first time.Interview, p. 8 She and her mother, who was a midwife, would work to persuade women to go to the hospital when needed, as they began to adapt to the new world. In 1956, Tiger Jumper was co-founder of a tribal newsletter, called the Seminole News. It closed a short time after others took it over. In 1967 Betty Mae Tiger Jumper was elected as the first female chairwoman, or chief, of the Seminole tribe, a decade after it gained federal recognition. She founded the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET), a group to run health and education programs for its members; it also became a powerful lobby with the states and Congress. In 1970, she was one of two women appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the National Congress on Indian Opportunity. She served on the Council for a total of 16 years.Interview, p. 9 Thanks to her leadership, the Seminole Tribe went from near bankruptcy in 1967 to having $500,000 when she left office in 1971. \\"I had three goals in my life,\\" Mrs. Jumper said in 1999. \\"To finish school, to take nurse's training and come back and work among my people, and to write three books.\\" She met those goals and many more. In the 1970s, the Alligator News was founded as the tribal newspaper. After it was renamed as The Seminole Tribune, Tiger-Jumper served as editor for several years and also became Communication Director for the Tribe. She wrote many articles about tribal traditions and culture. By 1999, the paper had four Seminoles working on it and five or six whites, and was being distributed across the country and internationally.Interview, p. 18 Tiger-Jumper was awarded the first Lifetime Achievement Award by the Native American Journalists Association.

Little is known of his life, although the title of his play Adonis mentions he was from the Nièvre region. Like his contemporary François d'Amboise, he associated himself with the king's Procureur général, Gilles Bourdin, as well as other dramatists of the period, such as Odet de Turnèbe and Pierre de Larivey. According to François d'Amboise, Le Breton wrote several tragedies -- Tullie, Charité, Didon and Dorothée -- which are today lost. His only extant theatrical work is a mythological play entitled Adonis, which was probably produced in 1569 before Charles IX, then again eight years later at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, and finally in 1579 at the Collège de Boncourt. Le Breton was also responsible for a translation of the travels of Cortés.

The Italian Professor Filippo Ravizza declared this day the \\"International Saving Day\\" on the last day of the congress. In the resolutions of the Thrift Congress it was decided that 'World Thrift Day' should be a day devoted to the promotion of savings all over the World. In their efforts to promote thrift the savings banks also worked with the support of the schools, the clergy, as well as cultural, sports, professional, and women's associations. Representatives of 29 countries wanted to bring to mind the thought of saving to the worldwide public and its relevance to the economy and the individual. The World Savings Day is usually held on October 31 except in countries where this day is a public holiday, since the idea is for the banks to be open, so that the people are able to transfer their savings into their account. The idea of World Thrift Day was not born out of nothing. There had been some examples of days that were committed to the idea of saving money in order to gain a higher standard of life and to secure the economy, for example in Spain where the first national thrift day was celebrated in 1921, or in the United States. In other countries, such as Germany, the peoples' confidence in savings had to be restored since many of them had lost their savings in the German monetary reform of 1923. After the Second World War, World Thrift Day continued and reached the peak of its popularity in the years between 1955 and 1970. It practically became a veritable tradition in certain countries. In Austria, for instance, the official mascot of saving, the so- called 'Sparefroh' (literally: 'Happy Saver', or rather \\"save happily!\\") reached a higher degree of brand awareness than the republic's President and even a street was named after him. In the 1970s, the 'Sparefroh-Journal', an educational magazine for younger people, reached a circulation of 400,000 copies. Nowadays the focus of the banks that organise the World Savings Day is on developing countries, where many people are unbanked. Savings banks play an important role in enhancing savings in these countries with certain campaigns and initiatives such as working with non governmental organisations in order to double the number of savings accounts held by the poor.

The SMKbox riboswitch (also known as SAM-III) is a RNA element that regulates gene expression in bacteria. The SMK box riboswitch is found in the 5' UTR of the MetK gene in lactic acid bacteria. The structure of this element changes upon binding to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to a conformation that blocks the shine-dalgarno sequence and blocks translation of the gene. There are other known SAM-binding riboswitches such as SAM-I and SAM-II, but these appear to share no similarity in sequence or structure to SAM-III. Structure The crystal structure of the riboswitch from E. faecalis was solved by X-ray crystallography. The structure showed that the most conserved nucleotides involved in SAM binding were organised around a junction between three helices. In some species there are large insertions of up to 210 nucleotides within this structure.

As a supplementary style, it is known across the Japan, the US and Europe. One of its primary teachers is Akio Minakami. In theory, Kenshin-ryū was the \\"peasants' art\\", and consists of several blocks, strikes, thrusts, and evasions. It is, however, an effective and powerful style that provides good basics and kihon that are easily absorbed into further kobudō training with other styles. Basic Techniques =Uncategorized= * Kiti-kai k'osh (sweep from left to right, upward snap to jaw, overhead downward strike) * 270 degree spin to the left * Upward push =Sweeps= * Back leg sweep * Hooking leg sweep - stepping forward * Hooking leg sweep - stepping backward =Thrusts= * Forward thrust * Sidestep thrust forward * Crouched side thrust * Downward back thrust =Blocks= * Push block - forward * Push block - downward * Spinning downward block =Strikes= * Spinning strike to the head * Overhead sword strike - forward * Overhead pulling strike - any direction may be used. In kata, 90 degrees right or 45 degrees left * Collarbone strike/crush, stepping forward * Collarbone strike/crush, stepping backward * Snap strike, right to left Fundamentals Basic posture is a high front stance, right leg forward, with the hips rotated to face forward. The bo is held in three equal portions, with the left hand at the hip and the bo pointing at the opponent's throat. Forward strikes are either executed from the shoulder or above the head (kendo style), with the bo either being stopped with the left hand at the hip or with the staff tucked into the left armpit. This is substantially different from most other bo styles as normally the body is turned to the side, presenting a narrow target to the opponent. Direction changes are typically done by dropping the center of gravity while also opening the hips while stepping. Also, in some instances a 270 degree spin is employed that also includes a retreating step, or a simple step/step technique where the feet come together briefly and the body rotates to the desired direction before resuming the desired stance. Power is developed in most techniques by utilizing the rear leg and minimal hip rotation in combination with upper body torsion. Beginning students typically either use extremity strength only or exaggerate the leg push/hip rotation. This is rectified easily by repetition training and attacking a weighted target to train for timing. There are some thrusts and strikes that generate power from the rotation of the shoulders from a leading to a trailing position - these are most pronounced in Kubo no koan, and typically only performed properly by advanced students. Most of the strikes are pushed out by the upper body and generally don't generate much obvious speed due to the short distances traveled. The exception to this is found toward the end of Kubo no koan, which utilizes a long pulling motion to execute a blow to the head - this is similar to Yammani-ryū. Kata There are five (5), kata in the syllabus, though only the first three are generally taught outside Japan. There are minor variations in kata between schools that commonly teach it. * Shodan no koan * Nidan no koan * Kubo no koan * Sanbon no koan * 5th kata Category:Shitō-ryū Category:Okinawan kobudo ","title":"Kenshin-ryū"},{"id":"14009865","text":"Papyrus 104 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by the symbol \\\\mathfrak{P}104, is a fragment that is part of a leaf from a papyrus codex, it measures 2.5 by 3.75 inches (6.35 by 9.5 cm) at its widest.

She has a vast repertoire encompassing Mozart, 19th-century German and Italian operas, and Lieder. Her career took off after she won the 1999 Cardiff Singer of the World competition. Biography Harteros was born in Bergneustadt, North Rhine- Westphalia, to a Greek father and a German mother and has two siblings, Alexia and Georgios. As a child, she was encouraged by her parents to pursue classical music and singing. Eventually, her music teacher at the Wüllenweber- Gymnasium in Bergneustadt, August Wilhelm Welp, noticed her considerable talent and recommended that she be professionally educated in singing. In 1986, she started voice training under Astrid Huber-Aulmann in Gummersbach, concurrently with her schooling. In 1990, she began studies with Wolfgang Kastorp, conductor and répétiteur at the Cologne Opera, who accompanied her in a series of concerts and later became her husband. Her first performances were in music institute concerts and in a school production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1990, as the Countess. In 1992 she gave her first concert at the Kantonsschule Schwyz in Switzerland. After completing high school in 1991, Harteros continued her voice studies under Liselotte Hammes at the Hochschule für Musik Köln. Her original singing teacher, Huber-Aulmann, continued to teach her until early 1996, and Harteros accompanied Huber-Aulmann on concerts tours in 1993 and 1994 to Russia and the United States, which attracted much attention to the singer. Just before her final exams, she was employed as an ensemble member of the Schillertheater NRW. After her 1996 exams, she joined the ensemble of the Theater Bonn. In the summer of 1999, she won the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, which led to many invitations for concerts and guest performances. This was the major breakthrough for her career: since then, she has appeared as a guest at all the major world opera houses, including the Oper Frankfurt, Opéra National de Lyon, De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam, Semperoper, Opéra Bastille, Hamburg State Opera, Vienna State Opera, New York Metropolitan Opera, Bavarian State Opera, Cologne Opera, and Berlin's Deutsche Oper, as well as the Salzburg Festival. She has also given concerts and Lieder recitals all over Germany, as well as in Boston, Florence, London, Edinburgh, Vicenza and Tel Aviv. Her repertoire includes the roles of Mimì (La bohème), Micaëla (Carmen), Eva (Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg), Elisabeth (Tannhäuser), Fiordiligi (Così fan tutte), Countess Almaviva (The Marriage of Figaro). In 2004, she sang her first Violetta in La traviata with the San Diego Opera, where she returned the next year for her first Amelia in Simon Boccanegra. In the 2004/05 season, she made four role debuts at the Bavarian State Opera, including Desdemona (Otello), Arabella (Arabella), Alice Ford (Falstaff), and the title role in a new production of Händel's Alcina as a part of the Munich Opera Festival. In February 2011, she debuted in Leonora in concert performances of Verdi's Il trovatore at the Kölner Philharmonie. Withdrawing from the planned debuting performances as the Marschallin in Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier in San Diego, she assumed the role in Munich and then in Vienna later in the year. In 2015, Harteros with Jonas Kaufmann and Antonio Pappano collaborated on a studio recording of Verdi's Aida.

Since then California has been served by a large number of newspapers based in many different cities. History The first newspaper published by Americans in California was The Californian, printed in Monterey in 1846 announcing the Mexican–American War, written half in English and half Spanish. The press was moved to San Francisco and printing started up again on May 22, 1847 in competition with the weekly California Star published by Mormon pioneer Sam Brannan, beginning that January. Both efforts suspended publication in the face of the California Gold Rush. By August, The Californian had resumed publication, but by November 1848, both papers were bought and merged then renamed the Alta California. The press that once printed The Californian was moved to the Sacramento area to be used on the Placer Times. The press was again moved and began publishing the Motherlode's first paper, the Sonora Herald, then taken to Columbia to print the Columbia Star. Within a few years of gold discovery, mother lode towns all had multiple competing journals. San Jose, California's first city, has one of the oldest newspapers in the state. The San Jose Mercury was founded in 1851 as the San Jose Weekly Visitor, while the San Jose News was founded in 1883. In 1942 the Mercury purchased the News and continued publishing both newspapers, with the Mercury as the morning paper and the News as the evening paper. In 1983 the papers were merged into the San Jose Mercury News, with morning and afternoon editions. Eventually the less-popular afternoon edition was dropped, so at present the newspaper publishes only as a morning paper. The newspaper has earned several awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes, one in 1986 for reporting regarding political corruption in the Ferdinand Marcos administration in the Philippines, and one in 1989 for their comprehensive coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake. The Mercury News was also named one of the five best-designed newspapers in the world by the Society for News Design for work done in 2001. Los Angeles's first paper, La Estrella de Los Angeles or The Los Angeles Star, began publishing in May, 1851, also half in Spanish (until 1855). The Southern Californian began in July, 1854, and an all Spanish paper, El Clamor Publico, began competing for Spanish-speaking readers in June 1855. San Diego's first paper was the Herald, established in May 1851. Before 1860, California had 57 newspapers and periodicals serving an average readership of 290,000. The Mountain Democrat, located in Placerville, CA, is the oldest newspaper in California, boasting continuous publication since 1851. The Mountain Democrat is a local newspaper covering news, sports, and features in El Dorado County. The oldest continuously operated paper on the North Coast (also the oldest paper north of Sacramento) is the Eureka Times- Standard, which has been in continuous publication since it began as the Humboldt Times in September 1854. Its longest operating competitor was the Humboldt Standard, which began in 1875. After many years competing as independent dailies, both papers were managed as separate operations under the same owner for a brief period before being combined in 1967, which resulted in the current name. Local ownership also ended in 1967. The Mountain Messenger, located in Sierra County, is California's oldest weekly publication, established in 1852, the adjudicated paper publishes on Thursday each week. The Messenger continues today and is published by Donald Russell, editor for the past 25 years, in Downieville. James King of William began publishing the Daily Evening Bulletin in San Francisco in October, 1855 and built it into the highest circulation paper in San Francisco. He criticized a city supervisor named James P. Casey, who on the afternoon when the story about him had run in the paper, shot and mortally wounded King. Casey was lynched by the early vigilante committee. The Morning Call was established and began publishing in December 1856, and later merged with the Bulletin to become the long running Call-Bulletin. The Sacramento Bee hit the streets in February, 1857 under the editorship of James McClatchy who began agitating on behalf of farmers against destructive practices of cattle ranching and hydraulic mining interests. During the American Civil War outspoken criticism of the federal government by the editor of The Los Angeles Star led to the Star being banned from the mails, and the arrest of its editor for treason. Banned from the use of the U.S. Mail in 1864 it published its last issue in October 1864. When the Los Angeles Star ceased publication its press and equipment were sold to pro Union Phineas Banning who started printing the Wilmington Star; the paper soon changed its name to the Wilmington Journal. In 1868, the paper announced that since Los Angeles already had a strong pro Union paper in the Los Angeles Weekly Republican, (published from 1867 to 1879), there was no longer any need for continuing publication of the Wilmington Journal. The San Francisco Chronicle debuted in June, 1865 as the Dramatic Chronicle, founded by Charles and M.H. de Young aged 19 and 17. Colonel (later General) Harrison Gray Otis took over management of two Los Angeles papers and established the Los Angeles Times. In 1887, young William Randolph Hearst took over his father's Daily Examiner which became the flagship of his national chain. Fremont Older became editor of the San Francisco Bulletin in 1895 and took up the struggle against the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad and along with a fellow Californian Lincoln Steffens, became a well known muckraker and the first objective observer to accuse District Attorney Charles Fickert for the framing of labor radical Thomas Mooney. Other cities have had their own long surviving papers, including the Fresno Republican, the Bee, and the Oakland Tribune. On October 1, 1910, a bomb exploded at the L.A. Times building, killing 21 workers. Labor activists were blamed for the bombing, but the San Francisco Daily News, a four-penny paper started in 1903, defended them. The Daily News joined the Scripps-Howard in 1921. The People's World began publishing in 1938, the first leftist daily published in the West. Newspapers for minority communities The oldest African-American newspaper, still active in the 1930s, was the California Eagle. It appeared first in Los Angeles in 1879. The first French journals, the Californien and the Gazette Republicane both began in 1850, and were followed by the Courrier du Pacifique in 1852. Both the first German and first Italian papers, the California Demokrat (1852) and the Voce del Popolo (1859) were founded in San Francisco and had long runs. The Chinese in California have published many newspapers, the first was the Gold Hills News in 1854.

They were also part of the Dunkirk fleet, which consequently was a part of the Spanish monarchy's Flemish fleet (Armada de Flandes). The Dunkirkers operated from the ports of the Flemish coast: Nieuwpoort, Ostend, and Dunkirk. Throughout the Eighty Years' War, the fleet of the Dutch Republic repeatedly tried to destroy the Dunkirkers. The first Dunkirkers sailed a group of warships outfitted by the Spanish government, but non-government investment in privateering soon led to a more numerous fleet of privately owned and outfitted warships. Origins and function Dunkirk was in the hands of the Dutch rebels from 1577 until 1583, when Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma re-established the sovereignty of his uncle Philip II of Spain as count of Flanders. Dunkirk was, at the time, an important, strategically positioned port with its approaches shielded by sandbanks. In 1583, Parma assembled a small royal squadron of warships to destroy Dutch naval trade and fisheries. However, it did not take long before the Habsburg authorities in the Low Countries began issuing letters of Marque, and privately owned warships filled the ranks of the Dunkirkers. These privately owned warships were known in Dutch as the particulieren, to distinguish them from the royal warships that were also part of the fleet. At their peak, the Dunkirkers operated about a hundred warships. The crews were mostly made up of Flemish and Walloon sailors, Spaniards and many individuals from the northern Netherlands and other nearby European countries.A.P. van Vliet, \\"The influence of Dunkirk privateering on the North Sea (herring) fishery during the years 1580–1650\\", in J. Roding and L. Heerma van Voss (eds.), The North Sea and Culture (1550–1800) (Leiden 1996), 150–165, esp. 156. Apart from targeting trade and fishing, the royal squadron was often used to convoy troops between Spain and the Spanish Netherlands. Effectiveness Despite a near constant blockade of the Dunkirkers' ports by Dutch warships, the privateers routinely managed to evade the blockaders and inflict much damage to Dutch shipping. Though the Dutch at times prevented the Dunkirkers from reaching open sea, during the winter months the blockade was extremely difficult to maintain and permitted virtually free passage. Sometimes naval battles ensued when privateers tried to break out or when Dutch warships tried to destroy the privateers in their harbours. During one of these Dutch attacks, the Dutch folk hero Piet Pieterszoon Hein, famous for capturing a Spanish treasure fleet, was killed. The Dutch declared the Dunkirk privateers pirates in 1587; captains of Dutch naval vessels had to swear an oath that they would throw or beat all prisoners from Dunkirk warships into the sea (euphemistically known as voetenspoelen, \\"washing the feet\\").Van Vliet (1996), 161. Due to its excessive harshness and the fact that it provoked equally cruel retributions from the side of the privateers, this standing order was very unpopular with Dutch crews and the general public.Th. de Nijs, E. Beukers and J. Bazelmans, Geschiedenis van Holland (Hilversum 2003), 162. The order was often evaded by putting Dunkirk seamen off on one of the many shallow shoals off the Flemish coast from which they could wade to dry land. The Dunkirkers had an extremely wide range for their era. Although mainly operating in and around the Channel, they also sailed near the Danish and German coastal areas to intercept Dutch ships returning from the Baltic, and operated in Spanish and Mediterranean waters. They cooperated closely with the Spanish navy, for instance, in the Battle of the Downs. This combined effort reached a peak of effectiveness during the time the Eighty Years' War merged with the Thirty Years' War. To evade the Dutch navy the Dunkirk admiralty had a special type of small and very maneuverable warship constructed, the frigate. Frigate-like ship types were soon adopted by other navies and still have their modern-day counterparts. In 1600 the Dutch sent an army to conquer the city of Dunkirk and stop the privateering once and for all. The Dutch invasion force clashed with a Spanish army and although the Dutch won the resulting Battle of Nieuwpoort the Dutch commander, stadtholder Maurits of Nassau, realised his lines were dangerously over-stretched and so turned back to the Republic. The Flemish Fleet continued to be especially damaging to the herring fisheries of Holland and Zeeland, almost completely wiping out the sector on several occasions. However, Dutch merchantmen proved far more valuable targets, sometimes vessels on their way back from Russia or as far as the Indies were captured, along with their valuable cargoes. Witte de With's Action with Dunkirkers off Nieuwpoort in 1640 After 1621, when the Twelve Years' Truce ended, the Dunkirkers captured on average 229 merchantmen and fishing vessels per year from the Dutch. By 1628, they had also seized 522 English vessels, primarily civilian fishing boats but also ships carrying munitions and victuals to the Dutch. This was one of the major concerns of Charles I of England's diplomatic representative in Brussels, Sir Balthasar Gerbier, who eventually managed to have tobacco taken off the list of 'victuals'. One of the most successful raiders of this period was Jacob Collaert. It was not until October 1646, when the French captured Dunkirk with Dutch naval support, that the danger from the privateers was greatly reduced. In 1652, Spanish forces recaptured the city and the Dunkirkers once again became a major threat. The Dunkirkers wiped out English trade after England resumed hostilities against Spain in 1657, before Dunkirk was captured by a Franco-English force in 1658.Cooper, J. P. (1979). The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 4, The Decline of Spain and the Thirty Years War, 1609-48/49. CUP Archive. .p.236 Ostend then became their most important port. When, after 1672, France and the Dutch Republic became enemies, privateering activities were resumed at Dunkirk, this time for France, and this would last intermittently until 1712. A famous Dunkirk privateer from this period was Jean Bart. Notes References * R.A.

Cohen, From the Maccabees to the Mishnah (1989), pp. 55–59, Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press, .A. T. Kraabel, J. Andrew Overman, Robert S. MacLennan, Diaspora Jews and Judaism: essays in honor of, and in dialogue with, A. Thomas Kraabel (1992), Scholars Press, . \\"As pious gentiles, the God-fearers stood somewhere between Greco-Roman piety and Jewish piety in the synagogue. In his classic but now somewhat outdated study titled Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era, Harvard scholar George Foot Moore argued that the existence of the God-fearers provides evidence for the synagogue's own missionary work outside of Palestine during the first century C.E. The God- fearers were the result of this Jewish missionary movement.\\" As Jews emigrated and settled in the Roman provinces of the Empire, Judaism became an appealing religion to a large number of Pagans, for many reasons; God-fearers and proselytes that underwent full conversion were Greeks or Romans, and came from all social classes: they were mostly women and freedmen (liberti), but there were also artisans, soldiers and few people of high status, like patricians and senators. Despite their allegiance to Judaism, the God-fearers were exempted from paying the \\"Jewish tax\\" (fiscus Judaicus). The class of God- fearers existed between the 1st and the 3rd century CE.Robert F. Tannenbaum, \\"Jews and God-Fearers in the Holy City of Aphrodite\\", Biblical Archaeology Review 12, 5 (1986), Center for Online Judaic Studies. They are mentioned in Latin and Greek literature, Flavius Josephus' and Philo's historical works, rabbinic literature, early Christian writings, and other contemporary sources such as synagogue inscriptions from Diaspora communities (Palestine, Rome and Asia Minor). Sources =Hebrew Bible= In the Hebrew Bible, there is some recognition of Gentile monotheistic worship as being directed toward the God of the Jews. This forms the category of yir’ei HaShem/yir’ei Shamayim (, meaning \\"Fearers of the Name\\"/\\"Fearers of Heaven\\", \\"the Name\\" being a Jewish euphemism for Yahweh, cf. Psalm ).Islam and Global Dialogue: Religious Pluralism and the Pursuit of Peace. ed. Roger Boase, Hassan Bin (FRW) Talal . Ashgate. 2010 Page 203 \\"Nevertheless, by late biblical times Israelites realised that there were other people in the world who worshipped the one, unseen God. Such people form the category of yir'ei Hashem (God-fearers, cf. Psalm 115:11); perhaps it is to ...\\"Jeffrey M. Cohen 500 questions and answers on Chanukah 2006 \\"Hence the references to them in Jewish sources such as Sebomenoi or Yir'ei Hashem (God-fearers). Many of them accepted monotheism, though held back from many other basic ritual precepts.\\" This was developed by later rabbinic literature into the concept of Noahides, i. e. Gentiles that follow the Seven Laws of Noah, which rabbinic writings assigned to the Noahic Covenant.Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 56a, 56b. =In inscriptions, texts and papyri= The Greek and Latin terms that refer to God-fearers (theosebeis, sebomenoi, phoboumenoi, metuentes)Pieter W. van der Horst, God-fearers (theosebeis) (2015), Oxford Classical Dictionary. are found in ancient literature (Greek, Roman, and Jewish) and synagogue inscriptions discovered in Aphrodisias, Panticapaeum, Tralles, Sardis, Venosa, Lorium (in Rome), Rhodes, Deliler (Philadelphia) and Miletus. Judging from the distinctions in the Acts of the Apostles, it is thought that they did not become gerim tzedekim, which required circumcision, although the evidence across the centuries varies widely and the meaning of the term may have included all kinds of sympathetic Gentiles, proselytes or not.Todd C. Penner, In praise of Christian origins: Stephen and the Hellenists, p. 226, 2004: \\"The category of Theosebes is notoriously difficult to delineate. It is debatable whether or not the term was ever a widely recognized technical designation of a Gentile \\"hanger-on,\\" and much of the evidence is difficult to date\\". There are also around 300 text references (4th century BCE to 3rd century CE) to a sect of Hypsistarians, some of whom practiced Sabbath and which many scholars see as sympathizers with Judaism related to God-fearers.James D. Arvila, p. 29. =In early Christian writings= In the New Testament and early Christian writings, the Greek terms God-fearers and God-worshippers are used to indicate those Pagans who attached themselves in varying degrees to Hellenistic Judaism without becoming full converts, and are referred to primarily in the Gospel of Luke () and more extensively in the Acts of the Apostles,Journal of Biblical Studies: Godfearer, by J. Brian Tucker: \\"The traditional understanding of God-fearers, i. e. F. F. Bruce, “God-fearers were Gentiles who attached themselves in varying degrees to the Jewish worship and way of life without as yet becoming full proselytes.”\\" which describes the Apostolic Age of the 1st century. Role in Pauline Christianity Judaising Gentiles and God-fearers are considered by modern scholars to be of significant importance to the growth of early Christianity; they represented a group of Gentiles who shared religious ideas and practices with Jews, to one degree or another. However, the God- fearers were only \\"partial\\" converts, engaged in certain Jewish rites and traditions without taking a step further to actual conversion to Judaism, which would have required full adherence to the 613 Mitzvot (including various prohibitions such as kashrut, circumcision, Shabbat observance etc.) that were generally unattractive to would-be Gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unappealing and execrable in Classical civilization; because it was the custom to spend an hour a day or so exercising nude in the gymnasium and in Roman baths, therefore Jewish men did not want to be seen in public deprived of their foreskins. Hellenistic and Roman culture both found circumcision to be cruel and repulsive. The Apostle Paul in his letters fiercely criticized the Judaizers that demanded circumcision for Gentile converts, and opposed them;, , , , , , , , , , . he stressed instead that faith in Christ constituted a New Covenant with God, a covenant which essentially provides the justification and salvation for Gentiles from the harsh edicts of the Mosaic Law, a New Covenant that didn't require circumcision (see also Justification by faith, Pauline passages supporting antinomianism, Abrogation of Old Covenant laws). Lydia of Thyatira, who became Paul's first convert in Europe, is described as \\"a worshipper of God\\" (); the Roman soldier Cornelius and the Ethiopian eunuch are also considered by modern scholars as God-fearers. In Paul's message of salvation through faith in Christ as opposed to submission under the Mosaic Law, many God-fearers found an essentially Jewish group to which they could belong without the necessity of their accepting Jewish Law. Aside from earning Paul's group a wide following, this view was generalized in the eventual conclusion that converts to Christianity need not first accept all Jewish Law (see Apostolic Decree), a fact indispensable to the spread of the early Christians which would eventually lead to the distinction between Judaism and Christianity as two separate religions.

It opened in May 1887 and closed on 1 January 1942 (with the last trains running the previous day). Route The railway was mainly situated in rural parts of County Tyrone, which hindered the company's potential profitability. The western terminus was Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, where the line shared Maguiresbridge railway station with the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) on the Clones to Enniskillen line. It then proceeded in a north-easterly direction through stations at Brookeborough, Colebrooke, Fivemiletown, Clogher and Augher until reaching Ballygawley station, at which point the line turned in a south-easterly direction to Aughnacloy, Caledon and the eastern terminus at Tynan, County Armagh (where the Great Northern Railway was again met, this time on the Clones to Portadown line) Aughnacloy was the line's principal station and the location of the company's headquarters and workshops. Fivemiletown was the second largest station. Like a tramway, the line passed down the middle of the Main Streets of both Fivemiletown Image and Caledon. The railway ran alongside the public roadway for nearly all of its length. Early years It was originally known as the Clogher Valley Tramway, but changed its legal status and its name to the Clogher Valley Railway in 1894. The start was not auspicious, the company required a loan of £44,000 from the Board of Works to enable the line to be finished. It was constructed under the terms of the Tramways Act 1883 and was built to a track gauge of 3 feet. Extensions were planned, including a branch line from Ballygawley to Dungannon and an eastwards link to the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway, but were never built. Prior to the 1930s the line was worked entirely by steam locomotives, with six tank engines built by Sharp Stewart. For almost all of its existence the railway made a loss (and required a subsidy from local ratepayers). The greatest profit ever made by the company was in 1904 - only £791. Later years From 1921 onwards, the line found itself located entirely within Northern Ireland (although running close to the border with the Irish Free State for almost its entire route). In 1922 a commission appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland recommended that the loss-making line should be taken over by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland), but the GNR(I) declined. The company struggled on, until it was taken over by a committee of management appointed by Tyrone and Fermanagh County Councils in 1928. Henry Forbes, the manager of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC), was one of the members of the new committee and was instrumental in introducing diesel traction - a then novel form of motive power. To reduce operating costs, two diesel vehicles were built for the railway by Walker Brothers of Wigan - a 28-seat railbus in 1932 and a rail lorry in 1933. The railbus was virtually identical to those operated by the CDRJC (which purchased both vehicles following the line's closure). In 1932 the CDRJC also acquired the CVR's unsuccessful steam tram locomotive built by Atkinson Walker, which was rebuilt as \\"Phoenix\\" with a diesel engine. This locomotive is now preserved at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra. The last trains ran on 31 December 1941, the railway becoming a victim of road competition and cost-saving measures during World War II.

Gradual inland migration of Tai peoples from China The Tai migration from the northern mountains into Thailand and Laos was a slow process, with the Tai generally remaining near the mountainous area in the region, where they were able to use their specialized agricultural knowledge relating to the use of mountain water for rice production. The earliest Tai settlements in Thailand were in the river valleys in the northern reaches of the country. Eventually, the Tai settled the central plains of Thailand (which were covered with dense rainforest) and displaced and inter-bred with the pre-existing Austroasiatic population. The languages and culture of the Tai eventually came to dominate the regions of both modern-day Laos and Thailand. In more recent times, many of the Tai tribes of Laos also migrated west across the border, establishing communities in Thailand. The Laotian Tai ethnic groups, often referred to as the Lao, are largely clustered in the Isan region of Thailand. =Origin of the Tai peoples= Tai-Dong people of Guizhou, China, in traditional dresses, similar to the existing tribe in northern provinces of Thailand Comparative linguistic research seems to indicate that the Tai people were a proto- Tai–Kadai-speaking culture of southern China, and like the Malayo-Polynesians, they may originally have been of Austronesian descent.Sagart, L. 2004. \\"The higher phylogeny of Austronesian and the position of Tai–Kadai\\". Oceanic Linguistics 43.411-440. Prior to living in mainland China, the Tai are thought to have migrated from a homeland on the island of Taiwan, where they spoke a dialect of proto-Austronesian or one of its descendant languages. Unlike the Malayo-Polynesian group who later sailed south to the Philippines and other parts of maritime Southeast Asia, the ancestors of the modern Tai-Kadai people sailed west to mainland China and possibly traveled along the Pearl River, where their language greatly changed from other Austronesian languages under the influence of Sino-Tibetan and Hmong–Mien language infusion. The coming of the Han Chinese to this part of southern China may have prompted the Tai to migrate once again. This time they went over the mountains of southern China into Southeast Asia through the mountains of Burma and Laos to the north of present day Thailand. The Tai ethnic groups are believed to have begun migrating south from China to Southeast Asia during the first millennium CE. While this theory of the origin of the Tai currently predominates, there is insufficient archaeological evidence to prove it, and linguistic evidence alone is not conclusive. In support of the theory, however, it is believed the O1 Y-DNA haplogroup is associated with both the Austronesian people and the Tai. =Tai ethnic fusion= Over the centuries, the Tai intermarried and absorbed many of the other populations who co-inhabited and/or politically occupied the region, particularly populations of Mon–Khmer, Burmese, and Chinese descent. This fusion of ethnicity has led to considerable genetic diversity in the modern Thai people, and has resulted in a Tai population that differs in culture, language, and apparel from the Tai ethnic groups who remained in China. Many of the individual Tai ethnic groups have assumed a common Thai identity and have adopted Thai cultural norms. =Individual Tai ethnic groups in Thailand= There are presently more than 30 distinct Tai ethnic groups in Thailand, contributing nearly 85 percent of the nation's population. The genetic stratification of the ethnic clades of the Tai ethnicity is an ongoing topic of debate among linguists and other social scientists. Continuous diverse Chinese immigration from the 13th century The history of Chinese immigration to Thailand dates back many centuries, and the specific Chinese ethnic groups which made their way to Thailand are numerous, although there is a greater concentration of Chinese from the southern provinces due to their geographic proximity to Thailand. The Chinese are part of the greater Sino-Tibetan ethnicity which also includes the Tibeto- Burmans. The Chinese immigrants were largely able to merge into the predominant Tai culture, and have contributed significantly to the economy and infrastructure of Thailand over the years. =Chinese immigration during the Ayutthayan Period= Chinese traders in Thailand, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong Provinces, began arriving in Ayutthaya by at least the 13th century. Ayutthaya was under almost constant Burmese threat from the 16th century, and the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the Burmese, but all four invasions failed. Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese in 1767. During the Ayutthaya period, many Chinese traders and soldiers inter-married with local Tai, infusing Chinese culture into the population early in its history. =18th and 19th century male Chinese immigration= In the late-18th century, King Taksin of Thonburi, who was himself half-Chinese, actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers came from Chaozhou prefecture in large numbers. By 1825, the population of Chinese in Thailand had reached 230,000, and it grew steadily due to a constant stream of Chinese immigrants to the country throughout the 19th century. Early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of Chinese men, who, of necessity, married Thai women. The children of such intermarriages were called luk-jin (ลูกจีน), meaning 'children of Chinese' in Thai. =20th century immigration of Chinese families= The Chinese population in Thailand had risen to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population was ethnic Chinese. The corruption of the Qing dynasty and the massive population increase in China, combined with high taxes, caused many families to leave for Thailand in search of work and a better life. Those who came before the First World War came overland or by sailboats called sampams, while after World War II most arrived by steam ship. The earlier tradition of Chinese-Thai intermarriage declined once large numbers of Chinese women immigrated in the early-20th century. New arrivals frequently came as families and resisted assimilation, retaining their Chinese culture and living in all-Chinese areas. Lolo migration from Tibet via Burma Loloish Akha tribe wearing traditional dress Some Loloish tribes such as the Lisu arrived in Thailand as recently as 100 years ago, while others came at a much earlier date. The Lolo are believed to have descended from the ancient Qiang people of western China, who are also said to be the ancestors of the Tibetan, Naxi, and Qiang peoples. They migrated from southeastern Tibet through Sichuan and into Yunnan Province, where their largest populations can be found today. =Origin of the Lolo= The Lolo (also commonly referred to as the Yi) are one of the two major distinct Tibeto-Burmese ethnicities within present-day Thailand, along with the Karen. The Lolo migrated southeast from Burma into Thailand. =Individual Loloish ethnic groups in Thailand= The Loloish of Thailand are generally hill tribes in the northern portion of the country, near the border with Burma. A list of the Loloish ethnic groups of significant size within Thailand are as follows: *Southern Loloish clade **Akha sub-clade ***Akha (population of approximately 60,000 in Thailand, centered on Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, and Mae Hong Son Provinces) ***Lahu (population of approximately 52,000 in Thailand) **Bisu (population of approximately 1,000 in Thailand, centered on Chiang Rai and Lampang Provinces) **Mpi (population of approximately 1,200 within Thailand) **Phunoi **Ugong *Northern Loloish clade **Lisu (population of approximately 16,000 in Thailand) Hmong–Mien migration from China via Laos Women in traditional Hmong dress Like the Lolo, many of the Hmong–Mien ethnic groups are among the hill tribes in Thailand. Their population is clustered in the northeastern region of Thailand near the Laotian border. The Hmong–Mien of Thailand generally migrated from China in the second half of the 19th century through Laos, where they established themselves for some time prior to their arrival in Thailand. An exception to the China-Laos-Thailand migration pattern is the Iu Mien people, who apparently passed through Vietnam during the 13th century, prior to entering Thailand through Laos. The Iu Mien arrived in Thailand approximately 200 years ago, contemporaneously with a large number of other Hmong–Mien migrants. =Origin of the Hmong–Mien peoples= The primary homeland of the Hmong–Mien ethnicity is said to be Kweichow, a province of southern China, where they settled at least 2,000 years ago. Karen arrival as refugees from Burma The Karen left Tibet and migrated to Burma as refugees, establishing themselves along the Burmese border with Thailand. When during World War II the Japanese occupied Burma, long-term tensions between the Karen and Burmese turned into open fighting. After the war ended, Burma was granted independence in January 1948, and the Karen, led by the KNU, attempted to co-exist peacefully with the Burman ethnic majority. However, in the fall of 1948, the Burmese government, led by U Nu, began raising and arming irregular political militias known as Sitwundan. In January 1949, some of these militias went on a rampage through Karen communities. In 2004, the BBC cited aid agencies estimates that up to 200,000 Karen were driven from their homes during decades of war, with 120,000 more refugees from Burma, mostly Karen, living in refugee camps on the Thai side of the Burmese-Thai border. =Origin of the Karen= The Karen people's ancestors were from Tibet, and are Tibeto-Burman, and therefore distantly related to the Lolo. =Individual Karen ethnic groups in Thailand= There are approximately 510,000 people of Karen descent living in Thailand. A list of the Karen ethnic groups of significant size within Thailand are: *Pa'o *Pwo clade **Phrae Pwo **Northern and Western Pwo *Sgaw–Bghai clade **S'gaw **Kayah (population of approximately 100,000 in Thailand, centered on Mae Hong Son Province) See also *Thai studies References Category:History of Thailand Thailand ","title":"Peopling of Thailand"},{"id":"14010279","text":"The 3rd Armoured Division () is a unit of the French Army.

It followed the Italian successes during the Trentino Offensive and the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in the spring of 1916.  Battle  A short, sharp encounter fought from 14-17 September 1916, the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo saw Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna shift his focus from broad-based diversionary attacks to tightly focused initiatives directed at single targets.. This latest Isonzo battle saw the Italian Third Army, with a large amount of artillery, attack on the Carso toward Nova Vas. Following a successful first day, Nova Vas was assaulted on the second day with substantial artillery bombardments on German bunkers. Within minutes of the Italians ceasing fire, the Austro-Hungarian forces surrendered. Nevertheless Cadorna's continued offensives along the Soča (Isonzo) did succeed in wearing away at Austro-Hungarian resources, both in terms of manpower and in crucial artillery availability. As each battle proceeded the Italians' war of attrition seemed ever more likely to wear the Austro-Hungarians into defeat, short of assistance from their German allies. The Eighth Battle of the Isonzo followed on 10 October 1916.

When his ship goes down, an officer has to make an agonizing decision on his overcrowded lifeboat. Richard Sale adapted the film from his 1938 short story of the same name, originally published by Scribner's Magazine. The plot has similarities to the real-life sinking of the American ship William Brown in 1841. The William Brown hit an iceberg 250 miles off Newfoundland and lost 31 of its 65 passengers. Two boats with 17 crewmen and the remaining passengers escaped the wreck, but more than a dozen passengers were sacrificed from the crowded longboat.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16168/Abandon-Ship/articles.html Though there is no direct acknowledgment by the filmmakers, the film ends with a voice-over stating, \\"The story which you have just seen is a true one. In real life, Captain [sic] Alexander Holmes was brought to trial on a charge of murder. He was convicted and given the minimum sentence of six months because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident.\\" Plot The luxury liner SS Crescent Star sinks in seven minutes after striking a derelict mine in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, taking with her nearly all of the 1,156 people on board. Twenty-seven of the survivors converge on a single lifeboat designed to accommodate only nine. The dying captain passes command to executive officer Alec Holmes. Holmes then learns from \\"Sparks\\" Clary, the ship's radio operator, that both transmitters were destroyed before a call for help could be sent. When Holmes organizes shifts between the men in the water hanging on the side and those in the boat, Edith Middleton insists on taking a turn in the sea. Mr. Hayden swamps the boat when he fails to listen to instructions, but everyone is brought back aboard. Holmes and Mr. McKinley talk about the impossibility of rowing a boat this heavy any distance at all, much less to the nearest land, Africa, 1,500 miles away. The mortally injured ship's engineer, Frank Kelly, warns Holmes that he must \\"evict some of the tenants\\" if anyone is to survive – \\"anyone who can't pay the rent, like me\\". Holmes is horrified and rejects the idea. \\"I thought you had guts enough to save half of them, instead of losing them all,\\" Kelly replies. Later in the night, Cookie thinks he sees light on the water. They fire a flare, but there is no response. The passengers talk revealingly about themselves and why they were on the cruise. Mr. Wilson, in the water, is found to be dead. With a major storm approaching, Kelly tells Julie \\"be kind to him when it happens.\\" Kelly struggles to his feet, points to the dying and the sick aboard and calls on Holmes to save those he can, then sacrifices himself by jumping overboard. Holmes tries to save him, but he goes under. As the gale worsens, Holmes eventually decides to take responsibility for choosing. And it will not be \\"women and children first\\". Some people are already dying of their injuries. When he orders officer Will McKinley to slip the first of these, an unconscious woman, over the side, McKinley protests and then goes overboard to receive her in his arms. One male passenger is knocked overboard by accident but Holmes sends others to certain death, until there are 15 left aboard. Only those capable of rowing to Africa, and a young boy who represents the future, will survive. Middleton observes that an atomic scientist, a brilliant playwright, and a famous former opera singer have been sacrificed to save two \\"apemen\\", a racketeer, and a devout coward, and asks, including herself, \\"Why are the wicked so strong?\\" Passenger Michael Faroni demands that Holmes go back for the others. Holmes refuses (it is impossible anyway) and Faroni wounds him in the shoulder by throwing a switchblade and is in turn shot dead with a flare gun. As Holmes predicted, the sea becomes a \\"nightmare\\" through which they row, relentlessly. The lightened lifeboat weathers the storm and the rest of the survivors thank Holmes for saving them. Realising he is now a liability due to his infected wound, Holmes refuses water and passes command to Clary. Holmes throws himself overboard, but they bring him back. Then, they hear a foghorn and see a ship emerging from the fog. As it comes to pick them up, Edith Middleton murmurs, \\"Too soon, Just a little bit too soon, brave captain.\\" The survivors, with the exception of Julie and Middleton, quickly repudiate Holmes' actions. Alongside the ship, Clary returns the ring. As Holmes climbs aboard on the rope ladder, alone, a voiceover says: \\"The story which you have just seen is a true one. In real life, Captain Alexander Holmes was brought to trial on a charge of murder. He was convicted and given the minimum sentence of six months because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident. If you had been a member of the jury, how would you have voted, guilty or innocent?\\" The question, \\"Guilty or innocent?\\", in large bold letters, lingers on the screen, while the camera remains trained on the lifeboat, floating empty and adrift.

Battle  The Eighth Battle of the Isonzo, fought briefly from 10–12 October 1916, was essentially a continuation of attempts made during the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo (14–17 September 1916) to extend the bridgehead established at Gorizia during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in August 1916. Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna was determined to continue Italian attacks to the left of the town, a policy that continued during the following (ninth) battle - with an equal lack of success. As with the earlier, Seventh, attack, heavy Italian casualties required that the short, sharp concentrated initiative be called off pending the army's recuperation. The seemingly interminable Isonzo onslaught was next renewed with the Ninth Battle of the Isonzo on 1 November 1916, the fifth and final attack of the year.

Including a triumvirate of battles launched after the Italians' successful seizure of Gorizia in August 1916 to extend their bridgehead to the left of the town, it ended in further failure for the Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna. The battle started with an attack on Vrtojba and the northern and central areas of the Karst Plateau.Cavallaro, Gaetano V. 2010. The Beginning of Futility. Bloomington, IN: Xlibris Corporation, p. 295. With the ninth battle fought from 1–4 November 1916 the combined casualty total from the three linked battles proved sufficiently heavy to ensure that each attack was of short duration (each less than a week). The Italians suffered 75,000 casualties and the Austro-Hungarians 63,000. As always along the Soča (Isonzo), the Austro-Hungarian Army's command of the mountainous terrain provided a formidable natural barrier to the Italians' attempts to achieve a breakthrough. Cadorna had intended to ensure such a breakthrough in the wake of the capture of Gorizia during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, but instead the war of attrition gathered pace. Neither side could particularly afford the casualties suffered but the Austro- Hungarians in particular were finding their defensive lines increasingly stretched. Realising this they continued to call upon their German ally to provide military assistance within the sector. When the Germans finally assented (sensing the potential collapse of the Austro-Hungarian position) and constructed a combined force in time for the Twelfth Battle of Isonzo, the results were dramatic. However, with the ninth battle called off in failure on 4 November 1916 and the Italians undeniably weakened by continual offensive operations throughout the year - 1916 had seen five Isonzo operations on top of four undertaken the year before - a lengthy break was taken for the winter. Operations renewed afresh with the Tenth Battle of the Isonzo on 12 May 1917.

Background With nine largely unsuccessful Isonzo battles conducted within an eighteen-month period to date, Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna – responsible for launching all nine – became increasingly uncomfortable at the prospect of German intervention to aid their weakening Austro-Hungarian ally on the Italian Front. For while it was clear that the Austro-Hungarian Army was suffering in what had become a war of attrition, the same could be said of Cadorna's army. Casualties suffered to date were tremendous and with each renewed battle tended to be higher on the Italian attackers side. The UK's new Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, had long believed that the war could not be won on the Western Front alone. Dubbed an \\"easterner\\" at home Lloyd George was nevertheless in favour of diverting British and French resources from the Western Front to the Italians along the Soča (Isonzo), to \\"knock the props out\\" from under the Central Powers. However Lloyd George's own field commanders, including Commander in Chief Douglas Haig – along with the French – disagreed, arguing that resources could not be spared from the Western Front, particularly with French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle's upcoming Aisne Offensive, aimed at ending the war in the west within 48 hours. Consequently, Nivelle dispatched Ferdinand Foch to meet with Cadorna and discuss their possible options. In the event the British and French agreed to rush aid to the Italians only in the event of an emergency – for example, large-scale German military assistance to the Austro-Hungarians; a contingency plan was thus developed to meet with such an eventuality. With the contingency plan arranged the French pressed Cadorna to launch a major offensive of his own along the Soča (Isonzo) to generally co-ordinate with their own large-scale Aisne Offensive (deployed in April 1917). Cadorna agreed and the tenth Isonzo offensive was launched with a preliminary artillery bombardment lasting two days on 12 May 1917. The offensive The Italians, deploying 38 divisions – against 14 Austro-Hungarian divisions – switched tactics once again. The previous three Isonzo battles had seen Cadorna concentrate short, sharp initiatives against closely defined targets, generally aimed at extending their sole bridgehead east of Gorizia. This time the Italians returned to the Kras plateau south-east of Gorizia, setting in train an infantry advance along a 40 km front in order to achieve a breakthrough towards Trieste. The second aim of the offensive was to conquer Mount Škabrijel, thus opening the way to the Vipava Valley. The Italian infantry attack was launched on 14 May. Initially success appeared likely. By the close of May the Italian army had advanced to within 15 miles (23 kilometers) of Trieste almost reaching the coastal town of Duino, although subsidiary attacks elsewhere failed. Nevertheless, a major Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive launched on 3 June reclaimed virtually all lost ground and by the time the battle was called off by Cadorna on 8 June little territory had been gained. Some fighting also took place in the northern sections of the front in the Julian Alps, where the Austro-Hungarians strengthened their positions along the Vršič mountain ridge. Casualties continued to be high: 157,000 Italian losses were sustained, with a further 75,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties. With morale in the Italian army plunging Cadorna planned one further breakthrough attempt as he massed the greatest number of divisions and artillery yet along the Soča (Isonzo) river. Accordingly, the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo was initiated some two months later on 19 August 1917.

Otto Fabricius (Store norske leksikon)Otto Fabricius (Den Store Danske) Biography Otto Fabricius was born in Rudkøbing on the island of Langeland, Denmark, where his father was a rector. In his youth, he was educated largely at home by tutors. In 1762, he was matriculated at the University of Copenhagen. In 1765, he was admitted to the Greenland Mission Seminary (Seminarium Groenlandicum), where he attended classes taught by Poul Egede. In 1768 he graduated with a degree in divinity.Otto Fabricius, dansk zoolog och språkman, präst (Ggravsted.DK) He was sent as a missionary to the southwestern coast of Greenland from 1768 to 1773. During this period, he made enormous amounts of observations and collections. His laboratory was an Inuit house made of turf. His only artificial light was an oil lamp. He had a few magnifying glasses and only one book was in his library, Linnaei Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus. Nevertheless, he made enough zoological observation to be able to publish Fauna Groenlandica (1780), which was written in Latin, after his return to Denmark. Here, he described 473 animal species, primarily marine, 130 of which were proposed as new to science. Detailed descriptions are given, including information on habitat and behaviour, the vernacular Inuit name, what use the Inuit make of the animal and not least how they caught or trapped it.Fabricius, Otto (1744-1822) (Megatherium Society)Otto Hansen Fabricius (Faaborg-slægten) In 1774, he was appointed rector at Drangedal in Telemark, Norway where he stayed until 1779 while he completed work for a Greenlandic language dictionary which was published in 1804. In 1789, he succeeded Poul Egede to become a lecturer in the Greenland Mission Seminary. In 1818, he was appointed an Honorary Bishop of the Church of Denmark and awarded a Doctorate of Divinity.Otto Fabricius (Trustees of Dartmouth College) Fauna Groenlandica *Fauna Groenlandica by Othonis Fabricii (1780) was published in Latin by Göttingen Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Hafniae; Lipsiae Rothe.Fauna Groenlandica (Biodiversity University Library) *Sections on mammals and birds translated from Latin into Danish by O.
