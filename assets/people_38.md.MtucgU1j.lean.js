Begay (b. 1953) is a Navajo textile artist born into the T√≥‚Äôtsohnii (Big Water) Clan and born from the T√°chii'nii (Red Streak Earth) Clan. Biography Begay is a fourth generation weaver who grew up surrounded by women weavers. From them she learned sheep herding and shearing, and how to work with wool. She learned to spin and card wool, and traditional Navajo weaving. Her mother taught her to identify plants to make dyes and to understand the dyeing process. At the age of 12, Begay sold her first rug. She later studied fiber arts at Arizona State University where she received her teacher's certificate. She lives in Tselani on the Navajo Nation and in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Artwork Begay's artwork is influenced by her Navajo identity, the forms of nature and the colors of the landscape, flora and fauna. She experiments with combining a natural color palette with unconventional non-reservation color. In a video produced by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, she describes how she makes dyes from plant matter and soils, and thinks of the weaving process as analogous to \\"painting with yarn\\". The horizonal motifs in her work are reflective of the vistas, mesas and plateaus in Navajo country. Some of the ingredients in her dyes are chamisa, juniper berries, sage and a particular fungus that grows on juniper trees. She obtains her wool from her sister who is a sheep farmer. Begay has traveled extensively to Bolivia, Guatemala, and Mexico to learn with other indigenous makers. She describes her work in relation to her cultural heritage: \\"Everything in my weaving is natural. I use the same techniques passed from my ancestors to me to create designs that have artistic and traditional value.\\" Exhibitions Begay's work has been exhibited at the National Museum of the American Indian Smithsonian Institution in New York; the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts; the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe, New Mexico; the C.N. Gorman Museum in Davis, California; the Kennedy Museum of Art, Athens, Ohio; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston among others. Her artwork was included in the exhibition \\"Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists.\\" In 2020, her art was exhibited in the landmark exhibition Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. A 2018 retrospective exhibition of her work entitled Tselani/Terrain: Tapestries of D.Y. Begay, was organized by the Museum of Northern Arizona. Awards In 2013, Begay received a Native American Art Studies Association Lifetime Achievement Award. Begay was named a 2018 USA Fellow by the United States Artists organization. In 2010 she received a SWAIA Discovery Fellowship, which supported her travel to Peru to work in collaboration with weavers there and participate in a Tinkuy de Tejedores gathering of weavers. She then traveled to Bolivia and Guatamala to facilitate workshops with local weavers. In 2019, she was named a Fellow by the Mellon Indigenous Arts Program, University of Virginia. Collections Begay's work is included in the collection of the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Her leadership led to the creation of the Rye Nature Center and the Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary that bears her name. Personal life Edith Mathews Gwynne, was the daughter of Edith Mathews and Arthur C. Gwynne, a broker, and the granddaughter of William Mathews. She was born in 1904 and grew up in Rye, New York. Edith was a graduate of Rye Country Day School and the Westover School, both single sex schools for girls. She married financier Bayard Whitney Read in 1926 and they had two children. Edith and her family lived in the historic Indian Village and Dogwood Lane neighborhoods of Rye. Both of their homes were close to The Apawamis Club where they were active members and where Bayard Read served as president in 1940. In 1942, Edith Read organized the Rye Unit of the Citizens'Committee for the Army and Navy to supply service men and women with care packages including knitted clothing items. In addition to her civic community service, Edith was an active member of the Garden Club of America and the Rye Garden Club where she served on its Conservation Committee. Edith and Bayard shared a passion for the natural world and wildlife preservation. In 1950, they donated 22 acres of hemlock woodland to Greenwich Audubon. Shortly after this, Edith's husband Bayard took up wildlife photography. He was credited with producing the first natural history motion picture about the American bald eagle; it was produced for the Cornell Ornithology Institute and distributed by the National Audubon Society. Advocacy Record Playland Lake next to Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary Inspired by her husband's interest in ornithology and her father's penchant for public service, Edith Read became increasingly engaged in conservation. In the fall of 1955, she helped circulate a petition recommending a plan for the acquisition and rehabilitation of a dilapidated ruins and its property known as the Parsons Tract for re-use as a 33-acre preserve and educational park. Following her urging at a public hearing in December 1956, the City of Rye purchased the former Marselis Parsons estate to create the Rye Nature Center. Read served as Chairman of the Center for 10 years. In her concurrent role as Chairman of the Rye Parks Commission, she and her committee drafted a long range plan for the site. The document included the reconditioning of overgrown formal gardens, cleaning a pond and laying out walking trails. In the 1960s, together with fellow members of the Rye garden clubs, Read also raised awareness about the detrimental impact of overzealous building in wetlands and water pollution in Westchester County. She warned that the Blind Brook was \\"in danger of even more pollution than at present because of the building of new multiple dwellings, many more housing developments, and the relocation of industrial plants in our area\\" an environmental concern that continues to this day. She spent more than 12 years helping to gather signatures for petition and writing letters to officials and local papers to halt potential development of two strategic parcels of land on the Rye Harrison border that were critical for flood protection. Read's successful efforts were lauded along with those of \\"the Little Garden Club of Rye, the Rye Garden Club, the Ceres Garden Club, the League of Women Voters and the Rye Conservation Society in insuring that open space and natural areas are preserved for the future. Their collective farsightedness has been instrumental in making the public increasingly aware of the necessity for conserving and preserving our natural resources.\\" Not surprisingly, when a Rye-Oyster Bay Bridge was proposed in the 1960s by Robert Moses, Read voiced her opposition to the project. Her stance was reinforced by family and fellow petitioners of the Rye Garden Club who also recognized the threat to Rye's air and water quality. Read's work did not go unnoticed by her hometown. With her outstanding record for civic engagement, Read was appointed as a Rye City Councilwoman on January 2, 1974. She received the American Legion's 19th Americanism Award on Memorial Day in 1976. This was the same year that she became Chairman of Westchester County's Soil and Water Board in 1976 committing herself to protecting natural water resources. Fully familiar with the devastating impact of flooding in her own neighborhood where \\"drains 'spouted like geysers'\\" and \\"innumerable small streams\\" contributed to the problem, Read spearheaded a plan to prohibit new construction in the flood prone Blind Brook watershed areas of the City of Rye and adjacent towns of Harrison and Rye town. Her work included the investigation of adding strategic structures like water retention basins. Governmental officials including Congressman Richard Ottinger lauded Read's tenacity. Edith Read battled Westchester County together with the Long Island Sound Task Force and Federated Conservationists of Westchester in a lengthy litigation aimed at halting dumping that was taking place in Rye along Long Island Sound near a portion of the historic Playland Amusement Park. Broken rides and refuse had been regularly dumped there for years along with garbage. Westchester County had plans to deposit dredged soil from the man made lake throughout the wildlife habitat. A resolution to protect the important bird area was finally reached in 1983 under the auspices of County Executive Andrew O'Rourke. Read's passion for conservation extended outside of Westchester too. She was a major player in preserving wetlands in the Adirondacks Forest Preserve. Legacy Edith G. Read Sanctuary Entrance next to Playland Amusement Park Nature Center at Edith Read Sanctuary, Rye, New York In 1970, Read's two decades long commitment to conservation was recognized by the League of Women Voters with the creation of an Edith G. Read Award to be given annually to a Rye resident who does the most for conservation. On June 17, 1978, Read's substantial efforts to create the Rye Nature Center were honored by naming the nature center's museum building after her. Her most notable tribute however, following years of passionate advocacy, is embodied in the Edith Read Wildlife Sanctuary, which was dedicated as a \\"forever wild\\" natural park on October 5, 1985. Today the park is owned and operated by Westchester County Parks and supported by taxpayer dollars. An additional Friends of Edith Read Sanctuary assists with fundraising. Edith died at 102 years old in 2006. On October 16, 2010, a plaque in her honor was unveiled at the sanctuary to recognize decades of Read's environmental stewardship.

Life Anna Ross was born in 1773 to the actor William Ross (died 1781) and his wife Elizabeth Mills, later Mrs John Brown (died 1823). She had an elder sister, Frances Mary Ross (later Fanny Robertson), and a younger half-brother, American John Mills Brown, both actors. She married the actor-manager John Brunton (1775‚Äì1849) on 6 September 1792, and they had at least four children. Two of their daughters were actors; the eldest was Elizabeth Yates. One son joined the British Navy. John's sister Louisa Brunton, an actress, married Major-General William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven. Ross wrote the comic opera The Cottagers when she was fifteen. It was published in 1788 and was performed at the Theatre Bury, as a benefit performance for Ross, on 24 October 1788 with a cast that included Ross, her mother and stepfather, and at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin on 19 May 1789, starring her mother. The piece was never again performed on stage in Britain, but it has been anthologized and praised in studies of 18th-century dramatic writing. Ross began acting in the 1780s with her mother and stepfather, J. Brown (died 1818); she acted in London at Covent Garden Theatre as Sylvia in Cymon in 1788 alongside her stepfather, who on that date also performed an \\"Occasional Epiloque\\" written by Ross, but she performed mostly in the British provinces. In 1792, in Edinburgh, she played Amaranth in John O'Keeffe's Wild Oats. After her 1792 marriage, she performed as Mrs Brunton, including a season with the company managed by her brother-in-law, Thomas Shaftoe Robertson, in Lincoln in 1802, including in The Padlock as Leonora and The Cabinet as Floretta. The same year, she played Margaretta in No Song, No Supper at the Robertson and Franklin company's Peterborough theatre. She performed extensively in Norwich during her career. She appeared at the Georgian Wisbech theatre (now the Angles Theatre), Wisbech, as Rosabelle in Foundling of the Forest from 27 April 1810 until her benefit night on 25 May (her credit states: \\"Her first appearance these 3 years\\"), followed by Garrick's The Jubilee on each date, as 1st country girl.Handbills held by the Wisbech & Fenland Museum At Wisbech, 10 years later, Ross appeared on 2 and 14 May 1820 as Miss Nancy in Killing No Murder, on 11 May 1820 as Rosabelle in Foundling of the Forest, played together with Bluebeard, in which she played Fatima, on 15 May she was Agnes in The Mountaineers, and on 16 May 1820 she appeared in Pizarro; or, The Conquror of Peru, together with the Browns, and also played Maria in Of Age Tomorrow on the same bill.

It is a surrealist story set in the pre‚ÄìCivil War South, concerning a superhuman protagonist named Hiram Walker who possesses photographic memory, but who cannot remember his mother, and is able to transport people over long distances by using a power known as \\"conduction\\" which can fold the Earth like fabric and allows him to travel across large areas via waterways. The novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list and was selected for the revival of Oprah's Book Club. Background Coates began writing the novel around 2008 and 2009. He had recently finished his first memoir, The Beautiful Struggle, and was encouraged by his agent to write fiction. At the time, Coates was extensively researching slavery and the Civil War. He was influenced by author E. L. Doctorow and \\"how he almost reinvented history; he made history his in a certain kind of way\\". Coates cited Doctorow's novels Ragtime (1975) and Billy Bathgate (1989) as early influences and recalled later reading The Waterworks. He was also influenced by his childhood love of comic books and, in general, the concept of heroes. While researching the Civil War, he was frustrated with how \\"a lot of the people who were held up as heroic were in fact straight-up white supremacists.\\" Coates worked on the novel for a decade in \\"various degrees\\". Plot Hiram Walker was born into slavery during the Antebellum South on a declining tobacco plantation in Virginia named Lockless. He is the mixed-race son of a white plantation owner and a black mother who was sold away by his father when Hiram was young. The local community consists of the enslaved (\\"the Tasked\\"); the landowners (\\"the Quality\\"); and the low-class whites. Hiram has an extraordinary photographic memory but is unable to remember his mother. However, in one instance when Hiram is driving across a bridge he suddenly has a vision of his mother dancing. When the vision ends, his carriage has fallen into the water. His (white) half brother drowns, but Hiram is transported out of the water. He learns that his miracle survival was a result of a superhuman ability he has called conduction, which transports himself and others across impossible distances. This conduction is triggered by powerful memories: those of his mother. He eventually becomes involved with the Underground Railroad. Hiram escapes to Philadelphia, where he encounters Box Brown and Jarm Logue. He eventually comes to meet a famous member of the Underground named Moses, who also has the power of Conduction.

Release On October 13, 2019, the novel debuted at number one on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction best-sellers list and at number one on the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction best-sellers list. The novel was selected by Oprah Winfrey as the first book for the revival of her Oprah's Book Club on Apple TV+. She called it \\"one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Right up there in the Top 5.\\" Reception At the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \\"Positive\\" rating based on 41 reviews: 13 \\"Rave\\" reviews, 23 \\"Positive\\" reviews, 3 \\"Mixed\\" reviews, and 2 \\"Pan\\" reviews. Publishers Weekly gave the novel a rave review, writing, \\"In prose that sings and imagination that soars, Coates further cements himself as one of this generation's most important writers, tackling one of America's oldest and darkest periods with grace and inventiveness. This is bold, dazzling, and not to be missed.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a favorable review, but felt it was \\"less intensely realized\\" than Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad (2015). Dwight Garner of The New York Times gave the novel a positive review, calling it \\"a jeroboam of a book, a crowd-pleasing exercise in breakneck and often occult storytelling that tonally resembles the work of Stephen King as much as it does the work of Toni Morrison, Colson Whitehead and the touchstone African-American science-fiction writer Octavia Butler.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the novel a rave review, saying it exceeded expectations for a debut novel and writing, \\"What's most powerful is the way Coates enlists his notions of the fantastic, as well as his fluid prose, to probe a wound that never seems to heal. [...] There‚Äôs an urgency to his remembrance of things past that brims with authenticity, testifying to centuries of bone-deep pain. It makes The Water Dancer feel timeless and instantly canon-worthy.\\" Constance Grady of Vox praised the \\"clarity of Coates's ideas and the poetry of his language\\" but largely panned the novel as a \\"mess\\" with monotonous characters and lacking a strong plot development to make up for it. She criticized the movement between the plot- driven and allegorical storytelling modes as \\"whiplash-inducing\\".

The book is considered both a bildungsroman and a work of autofiction, as the narrative incorporates many details from Lerner's own life. The novel was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Background As in Lerner's previous novels, the narrative contains autobiographical elements. Like the protagonist, Adam Gordon, Lerner grew up in Topeka and won a national debate championship in high school, and like Adam's mother Jane in the novel, Lerner's mother, Harriet Lerner, is a psychologist who has published best- selling books aimed at a non-academic audience. Critics Rumaan Alam and Christine Smallwood have referred to the book as an example of autofiction. Plot summary The novel is set primarily in Topeka, Kansas, in the late 1990s, and is told mainly from the perspective of three characters: Adam Gordon, a high school debate champion, and his parents Jane and Jonathan, who are psychologists at a local institution known as the Foundation. In a nonlinear narrative, the novel explores Adam's preparation for a national debate championship (which he wins), his relationship with his girlfriend Amber, and his parents' lives. One of Adam's classmates, Darren Eberheart, a social misfit and patient of Adam's father, also features in a sequence of shorter chapters that culminates in him seriously injuring a girl at a party who rejected his romantic advances after years of bullying by his peers. The final chapter takes place in 2019 and follows Adam, now a father of two young girls, as he and his wife take their family to Topeka from their home in New York City to protest the Trump administration's family separation policy. Reception According to literary review aggregator Book Marks, the novel received mostly positive reviews. Writing for The Paris Review, Nikki Shaner- Bradford praised Lerner's prose. Christine Smallwood, writing for Harper's, referred to Lerner as a \\"supremely gifted prose stylist, at once theoretical and conversational\\". Garth Risk Hallberg in The New York Times Book Review acclaimed the novel as ‚Äúa high-water mark in recent American fiction.‚Äù The book was named one of the top ten books of 2019 by both the New York Times Book Review and the Washington Post. It was a finalist for the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction, as well as the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2020 Themes Lerner describes The Topeka School as about, among other things, \\"a violent identity crisis among white men\\" in the 1990s that prefigured the election of Donald Trump in 2016. One of the primary conflicts of the novel is between the prevailing political centrism and \\"end of history\\" rhetoric of the time, accepted largely unthinkingly by Adam and his cosmopolitan parents, and an undercurrent of right-wing anger voiced in its most extreme form by the protests of the Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church. Critics have also noted the themes of toxic masculinity (especially in the Darren subplot) and the breakdown of language as a medium of communication, epitomized by the debating technique of \\"the spread,\\" wherein a debater tries to overwhelm their opponent with as many arguments as possible regardless of their merit.

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Location The Gros M√©catina River is about long, and originates in Lac Boucher east of the Little Mecatina River and north-west of Robertson Lake. It has a winding course and passes through many lakes. The river flows in a generally southeast direction and empties into the Gulf of St. Lawrence near the Gros M√©catina Archipelago, west of the Baie des Moutons and the village of Mutton Bay. The hills just inland from Mutton Bay are almost high. The mouth of the Gros M√©catina River is in the municipality of Gros-M√©catina in Le Golfe-du-Saint- Laurent Regional County Municipality. The Gros M√©catina Archipelago is in the Gulf to the southeast of the point at the river's mouth. The river basin includes parts of the unorganized territory Petit-M√©catina and the municipalities of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent and Gros-M√©catina. The basin covers . Lac du Gros Mecatina is not far upstream from the river's mouth. Other lakes in the watershed include Lac Bernadette, Lac Talbot, Lac Boucher, Lac Garin, Lac Doris, Lac Arabian, Lac Lev√™que and Lac Grenville. Name The name \\"M√©catina\\" comes from the Innu language makatinau, meaning \\"big mountain\\". In 1694 Louis Jolliet used the term Mecatinachis for the island of Petit M√©catina. The qualifiers Petit and Gros (Small and Big) were used to distinguish two nearby trading posts in the 18th century. On 20 September 1739 Jean-Baptiste Pommereau was granted a concession for the Gros M√©catinat, and on 15 January 1740 the intendant Gilles Hocquart granted Henri- Albert de Saint-Vincent seven or eight leagues of shoreline at Petit Mecatina. The names of the rivers that led inland from these trading posts were translated as the Big Mecatina River and Little Mecatina River by the English. Conservation The proposed Harrington Harbor Biodiversity Reserve would lie in the river's watershed. A bird sanctuary, the Gros-M√©catina Migratory Bird Sanctuary, covers Plate Island and Trois Collines Island as well as Marmette Islands and Rocks. It is fully protected and access is forbidden. It is owned by the Federal Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife and is subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Canada Wildlife Act and the Regulations on migratory bird sanctuaries. The tidal zones of the Gros M√©catina River and the V√©co River are outside the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Gros-M√©catina and are managed by the bird sanctuary. Fishing Commercial fishing began on the Gros M√©catina River in 1749, when the river was known for the number and quality of its brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The salmon go up the river to a large waterfall about from its mouth. In this section, the Pourvoirie M√©catina has the exclusive fishing rights. There are about 20 pools where fish can be caught between July and September while wading on rocks without sand. Between 2012 and 2016 an average of 90 juvenile salmon and 4 large salmon were reported caught each year. In 2017 harvesting of large salmon on the river was allowed in the second part of the season. The river exceeded its target for salmon management in 2018, and in July 2018 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks announced that in August anglers could keep their catch of one large salmon or longer in the Gros M√©catina, Napetipi, Saint-Paul, Vieux Fort and Matapedia rivers.

Zeeshan expects her to take his name, but he is offended when Rida takes nobody's name. Zeeshan gets typhoid fever and learns that he can never become a father, which causes him to become more insecure because Rida's brothers are richer than him, something Shamila constantly mentions. Zeeshan tells Rida to return her dowry, which she unwillingly does, her brothers get hurt and Shamila sends a recording of their conversations to Zeeshan, who gets even more possessive about Rida.

Zeeshan panics and he scolds Rida for mentioning it. Faham sends a maid to Rida's home after Shamila comments that Rida is forced to do all the housework by herself. Zeeshan again scolds Rida and tells the maid that they do not need her.

Rida begs Zeeshan to believe she's innocent but Zeeshan announced their marriage is over. Rida screams and shouts at her brothers to stop Zeeshan but they both look at her in disgust before leaving. Before moving back to her maternal home Shamila continues to poison both brothers against Rida by constantly reminding them she's responsible for Faham's death. Both brothers make it clear that they find Rida to be a burden, their brother's murderer, and that they are only tolerating her for their mother's sake. Tauqueer finds out his letter is the cause for Rida's marriage being wrecked and tries his hardest to fix it; his sister speaks to Zeeshan, explaining Rida's innocence but Zeeshan remains adamant to believe Rida was unfaithful. Rida learns she is pregnant and believes the baby will be a chance for her and Zeeshan to reunite. However, an angry Zeeshan informs Rida he cannot become a father so the child is not his but hers and her lover's, proof that she was cheating on him. Rida gets very hurt by Zeeshan's words and vows never to forgive him. The stress causes Rida to faint and have a miscarriage. Meanwhile, Zeeshan is called back into the doctor's office and informed there had been a report mix up and that he is, in fact, able to become a father. Zeeshan regrets his harshness towards Rida only to learn about her miscarriage. He begins to reflect on his behavior and realizes how unreasonable and possessive he was towards her. When he asks Rida's family to forgive him, Hatim shouts at him but finally agrees, but says he will only forgive Zeeshan if Rida forgives him.

Rida goes with Asim to find Zeeshan where she gets a call from the serial killer who says that Zeeshan has come to him to die. Just as Zeeshan is getting whipped, Rida and Asim stop him. Rida unties Zeeshan and asks him why he was giving himself such a punishment, to which he answers that he wanted Rida to forgive him. Rida forgives him for the sake of their child and says that she kept their child alive. Zeeshan then gets happy for a split second, as he was misinformed that Rida had a miscarriage.

It turns out, that Jeanne and Mickey had a love-hate relationship in the past, and Mi's behavior in the months leading to the accident was increasingly erratic, and she refused to visit the dying Raffermi. Jeanne is reluctant to let Mickey see any of her old acquaintances. Mi suspects that Jeanne may be hiding something. Mickey becomes increasingly convinced that she is not really Michele but Domenica. When confronted with this supposition, Jeanne admits that she and Do were planning to get rid of Mi by staging a fire accident, and then pass Domenica for Michele to receive the inheritance. Then the heroine meets Serge Reppo, a young postal worker, who claims that he warned Mi of Jeanne and Do's plot several days before the accident. The survivor is then Michele who was able to turn the tables on Domenica. The heroine realizes that she doesn't know anything apart from what others told her, and is tormented by the uncertainty. Is she Michele or Domenica, the victim or the murderess? Style and structure The novel subverts the conventions of the genre as the amnesiac heroine assumes all the basic roles of a mystery story: \\"I was the detective, the murderer, the victim and the witness, all at once.\\" Jacques Dubois thus compares it to Alain Robbe- Grillet's The Erasers, \\"a novel inspired by crime fiction in which the major roles become intwined.\\" Susan M. Myers writes that \\"Japrisot has constructed his story in such a way that the text reveals, but then conceals the identity of the heroine, for each time a possible interpretation arises, doubt floods in from another source.\\" Martin Hurcombe and Simon Kemp suggested that in this respect, the novel is not so much a \\"whodunit\\" but a \\"whoizit\\". Some critics argue that even in the end, the identity of the heroine is never adequately established. The narrative ambiguity is reflected in the chapter titles: \\"I will have murdered\\", \\"I murdered\\", \\"I would have murdered\\", \\"I shall murder\\", \\"I murdered\\", \\"I murder\\" and \\"I had murdered.\\" The bulk of the text is narrated in first person by the amnesiac protagonist. Her narration is framed by a fairy-tale style prologue (omitted in the English translation) and a very short epilogue in the style of a news item. They are both told in third person by an unidentified narrator. The chapters ‚ÄúI shall murder‚Äù and ‚ÄúI murder‚Äù are also narrated in third person but the chapters that follow identify them as transpositions of the oral accounts given to the heroine by Jeanne Murneau and Serge Reppo respectively.  Reception  Trap for Cinderella was the winner of the 1963 Grand Prix de Litt√©rature polici√®re in France, and was described as \\"a Simenon proofread by Robbe-Grillet\\" and \\"Marienbad of the crime novels.\\" Anthony Boucher called it \\"a beautifully intricate essay in novel-writing and mystery-making,\\" in which \\"the uncertainties and ambivalence are sustained with great skill\\", and added that the novel \\"certainly maintains Japrisot's reputation as a highly original and professional writer of murder-suspense.\\" Martin Hurcombe and Simon Kemp write that \\"Japrisot's innovation... lies in the extreme juxtaposition of the competing versions of the event, and the ambiguity that results both from this and the use of an amnesiac detective, a device that has become more current since the publication of Pi√®ge.\\" Shoshana Felman called it a \\"spectacular literary achievement\\" and \\"arguably the most literally remarkable crime novel ever written in French.\\" T√©l√©rama wrote: \\"S√©bastien Japrisot does not just play with the nerves of the reader, he takes the latter through the looking glass and then shatters it.\\" Publications in English * New York: Simon and Schuster, 1964 * London: Souvenir Press, 1965 * Harpenden, Herts: No Exit Press, 1990 * New York: Plume, 1997  Adaptations  =Film and TV= * 1965: Trap for Cinderella, French film directed by Andr√© Cayatte.

Many marine organisms, ranging from zooplankton (e.g. foraminifera) to phytoplankton (e.g diatoms) to reef builders (e.g. coral), create shells or skeletons from chemical compounds dissolved in seawater. This process, which is also called biomineralization, therefore records the chemical signature of seawater during the time of shell formation. However, different species have different metabolism and physiology, causing them to create their shells in different ways. These biological distinctions cause species to record slightly different chemical signatures in their shells; these differences are known as vital effects.  Importance to scientific research  Vital effects are relevant to study because of their influence on paleoclimatic interpretations. Scientists study the isotopic composition of marine organisms‚Äô shells that have been preserved in marine sediment in order to reconstruct past environmental conditions. The earliest example of this work is using oxygen isotopes from the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in belemnites to reconstruct paleotemperatures. It is important to understand vital effects because they affect how paleoclimatic data are interpreted, which influences how scientists predict future impacts of climate change. = Examples =  Foraminifera  Foraminifera are widely used for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic research because of the oxygen isotopes in their calcium carbonate shells. Oxygen isotopes, or Œ¥18O, are used to interpret past temperature and ice volume. Foraminifera also incorporate trace amounts of boron in their shells, which is used to reconstruct past pH. Foraminiferal isotopic composition is affected by factors such as algal symbionts or species-specific physiology. The influence of such vital effects can be determined via culture experiments.  Coral  Similar to foraminifera shells, the isotopic composition of coral skeletons is used to reconstruct past temperature, CO2 concentrations, and pH. Vital effects arise from algal symbionts and biological responses to changes in conditions such as pH. Again, culture experiments are used to quantify vital effects and calibrate the use of coral isotopic composition as a proxy.  Diatoms  Diatoms can also be used to study oxygen isotopes and are especially useful in regions of the ocean where foraminifera do not preserve in marine sediments. One example of vital effects in diatoms is a difference in Œ¥18O between two different species, Coscinodiscus marginatus and Coscinodiscus radiatus, which is attributed to their difference in size.

She served with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I in France, Belgium, and Greece. Born in Quebec in 1874, she worked as a nurse and volunteered for duty when war was declared in 1914. She shipped to England with the first set of troops and was among the first 100 nurses to serve near the Western Front in France. She published her memoir, Our Bit: Memories of War Service by a Canadian Nursing-Sister, in 1934. Biography Clint was born in Quebec City, Quebec, in 1874. Her father, William Clint, was an Englishman working as an insurance agent. Her mother, Caroline Brown, was Scottish. She had two sisters, Olive and Effie. In her early twenties, she worked as a writer. Using the pen name \\"Harold Saxon\\", she published two non- fiction books, Under the king's bastion; a romance of Quebec, comprising many true and interesting historical sketches and descriptions of the customs and habits of the people of Quebec, ancient and modern (1902), and Imperial Anniversary Book (1909). She decided to enter the nursing profession and in 1910 graduated from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. In 1914 when war was declared, Clint volunteered for duty with the Canadian Army Medical Corps and was assigned to the No. 1 Canadian General Hospital Battalion. She sailed for England on September 29, 1914, aboard the RMS Franconia. When she arrived she briefly resided at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. She was sent to the 1st Canadian General Hospital in Boulogne on May 13, 1915 where she stayed about two months. She was then reassigned to the mission that resulted in the Gallipoli Invasion in Turkey. She arrived at the Greek island of Lemnos where she was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Stationary Hospital. The hospital was part of a relief effort to aid the ANZAC medical staff who were overwhelmed with the casualties from the fighting in Turkey. The Canadians were unprepared for the conditions on Lemnos, and several of the medical staff including Clint became sick with dysentery. Complications led to her becoming seriously ill, and she was hospitalized in Cairo in February 1916. She returned to Canada in June for convalescence but was unable to return to army nursing and was invalided out of the service in November. In appreciation for her contribution to the war effort she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, 2nd class. After a year of recuperation she re-enlisted and was sent back to England in December 1917; she was posted to the No. 16 Canadian General Hospital. In February 1918 she was transferred to France, joining the team of the No. 4 Casualty Clearing Station. On April 3, 1918 she was awarded \\"One Red, 2 Blue Service Chevrons.\\" After the war ended she returned to Canada in 1919 and resumed her nursing career. In 1934, she recounted her wartime experiences in a memoir, Our Bit: Memories of War Service by a Canadian Nursing-Sister, which was published in 1934. She spent another year in England in 1930 but lived most of the rest of her life in Quebec, where she died in 1939.

NCO Candidates (NCOC) allowed to attend the course were selected from volunteers and many candidates were among the brightest soldiers of Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training or in a subsequent assignment that demonstrated outstanding leadership potential. The program was in existence only during the U.S. war in Vietnam. History By the end of 1966, the US military presence in South Vietnam had grown to 385,000 with the majority of soldiers in the US Army. During the Vietnam build-up, many of those doing the fighting were enlistees and draftees as the Reserve forces were not mobilized for this action. Without ‚Äúcalling up‚Äù the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve Army, leaders had to induct and train raw talent and to distribute those new recruits and existing personnel worldwide. The size of the active component was not large enough to provide all requirements for the expanded Vietnam commitment and the Army found itself without alternative plans for expanding its strength. The rapid buildup, coupled with a Department of Defense directive that established a 12-month tour of duty in Vietnam made the replacement program a fundamental problem. In order to meet these unprecedented requirements for NCO leaders the Army developed a solution called Skilled Development Base (SDB) Program on the proven Officer Candidate Course where an enlisted man could attend basic and advanced training, and if recommended or applied for, filled out an application and attended OCS. The thought by some was that the same could be done for noncoms. If a carefully selected soldier can be given 23 weeks of intensive training that would qualify him to lead a platoon, then others can be trained to lead squads and fire teams in the same amount of time. From this seed, the Noncommissioned Officers Candidate Course (NCOC) was born. In August 1967 the Army established the Skill Development Base (SDB) program of formal instruction and on-the-job training (OJT) to address the Army's shortage of deployable enlisted personnel, and to fill requirements (mostly overseas) for squad and team leaders in pay grades E-5 and E-6 in Vietnam. When created, it had three sub-programs, the Noncommissioned Officer Candidate (NCOC) Program, the Noncommissioned Officer/Supervisor Program, and the Specialist Program. The expectation was that graduates would be able to perform in their specialty at the grade they were promoted to on their first duty day. The Training Centers were given 24-weeks to accomplish that and the expectation was that students must have at least 13-months remaining on their enlistment contract when they completed all their studies. The NCO Candidate Program was envisioned to relieve the pressure of the shortage of combat leaders. Overview The 1965 build-up of United States Army ground forces broadened the conflict in Vietnam. As the war progressed, the attrition of combat, the 12-month tour limit in Vietnam, separations of senior noncommissioned officers and the 25-month stateside stabilization policy began to take a toll on the enlisted force to the point of crisis. Without a call up of the reserve forces, Vietnam became the Regular Army's war, fought by junior leaders. The Army was faced with sending career noncoms back into action sooner or filling the ranks with the most senior PFC or specialist. Field commanders were challenged with understaffed vacancies at base camps, filling various key leadership positions, and providing for replacements. Older and more experienced NCOs, some World War II veterans, were strained by the physical requirements of the methods of jungle fighting. The Army was quickly running out of noncommissioned officers in the combat specialties. The NCOC course involved an initial 12-week training program at Fort Benning, GA with minimum classroom instruction. The emphasis was on practical training in the field, approximately one-third of which was at night. Three distinct phases of the course were intended to develop the candidate into a noncommissioned officer who could discharge his duties with confidence and competence. At the end of 12 weeks at an NCOC training center, the new NCO's were assigned to Vietnam- oriented training centers for 9 weeks of on-the-job training. During on-the- job training, the NCOs performed in responsible leadership positions such as squad leaders, platoon guides, and assistants. By the career military and older noncoms, graduates were often called \\"Instant\\" NCOs\\" and the men who completed the course were referred to as, \\"Shake n' Bakes\\", \\"Instant's\\", or \\"Whip n' Chills\\" because of the speed in which they made rank.  Selection Criteria  1\\\\. Security clearance of Confidential. 2\\\\. Infantry score of 100 or higher. 3\\\\. MOS 11B, skill level 1 and 2 and 11C or 11H at skill level 1, 2, or 3. 4\\\\.

The first Army-wide Basic Courses began May 1971 and in January 1972 the first two advance courses were taught. By late-1971, NCO Academies began the transition to the Basic Course as part of the newly created NCO Education System (NCOES). In November 1971 the Department of the Army directed that NCOC should end after January 1972. Over its 4 1/2-year existence the program trained about 33,000 NCOs at the various NCOC locations.

Hemingway lived in the home with his family for the first six years of his life. The house, now owned by The Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park, is open for guided tours. History Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois on July 21, 1899, in a home built by Hemingway's maternal grandparents, Caroline and Ernest Hall. Hemingway was the second child and first son of Dr. Clarence and Grace Hemingway. He lived in the Hall house for the first six years of his life with his parents, maternal grandfather, and three sisters. The house, currently numbered 339 North Oak Park Avenue, was the first home in Oak Park to have electricity. Across the street from the Hall home was the two story, white clapboard home of Hemingway's paternal grandparents, Anson and Adelaide Hemingway. Dining room Grandfather Hall, known to the Hemingway children as Abba, was a much loved family member. In later life, Marcelline Hemingway Sanford, Ernest's older sister, would write about Abba Hall, recalling his kindness, generosity, and entertaining stories that were a delight to young Marcelline and Ernest. Grace's maternal uncle, Tyley Hancock was a frequent visitor to the family home. He would often entertain the children with adventurous stories from his youth and from his travels as a salesman for the Hall family's wholesale cutlery business. Hemingway's mother Grace, was an operatic singer, voice teacher and composer. She earned money for the young family by teaching music and voice lessons. Hemingway's father, Clarence, a medical doctor, delivered three of the Hemingway children in an upstairs bedroom of the home. He would consult with medical patients in a small office between the first and second floor. According to Sanford, \\"It was to the office that Ernest and I were called for punishment when we misbehaved.\\" Kitchen Ernest's grandfather died in May, 1905, leaving the home to his daughter, Grace. By October, Grace had sold the house to Samuel Nissen, an Oak Park grocer. The Nissen family lived in the North Oak Park Avenue house for fifteen years, replacing the front porch with a screened in porch in 1914 and later replacing the clapboard exterior with aluminum siding. During the 1920s through the 1940s, the house was converted into a rooming house. The larger living areas and hall were divided and a bathroom was installed on the first floor. In 1951, the house was remodeled again to create a two-family residence. The house was purchased by The Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park in December 1992. The foundation embarked on a major renovation, using Sanford's description of her grandfather's home. The Ernest Hemingway birthplace was restored to its original 1890s layout, with Victorian period furnishings and original Hemingway family heirlooms. In 2001, the Ernest Hemingway Birthplace Museum was open to the public. Description Children's nursery Hemingway's maternal grandparents, Caroline and Ernest Hall, built the house in 1890 on land they purchased in November 1889. The architect was Wesley Arnold. The Victorian 3-story house consisted of first and second floors, a basement and an attic. The house exterior had wooden clapboard siding with a shingle roof. The house was initially painted gray with a darker gray trim. Window trim was a dark green. There was a large open wrap-around porch with open railings that covered the front of the house and the turret on the southeast corner. There was a small open porch in the back that provided access to the kitchen. On the first floor was an entrance hall with a formal stairway leading to the second floor. There was a long parlor to the left of the hall with a bay window facing the street. The parlor led into the formal dining room. Next to the dining room and parlor was a small library, where Hemingway's grandfather and great-uncle Tyley Hancock would smoke and drink wine after their evening meal. There were oak floors and yellow pine woodwork throughout most of the house, both stained a medium brown. Water lines had been installed along Oak Park Avenue before the house was built, making it possible for the house to have running water. The kitchen was a small dark room behind the dining room, with a door leading to the back porch, a stairway leading down to the cellar, and back stairway to the second floor for the servants. There were six bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor. The Hemingway babies would sleep with their mother until they were old enough for the children's nursery. Hemingway and his older sister Marcelline shared the nursery when they were toddlers, sleeping in identical, white cribs with spindles.

The long valley runs from the Lustrafjorden at the village of Gaupne, to the north along the river Josted√∏la and along the eastern side of the Jostedal Glacier. The valley is deep, but the valley floor lies over long stretches of flat river plains interrupted by steep steps. In the north, the landscape gets pretty wild. The Jostedalsbreen National Park surrounds the valley, which brings a lot of tourism to the area. The Nigardsbreen glacier is also accessible from the valley. Historically, most of the valley was part of the old municipality of Jostedal from 1838 until its dissolution in 1963 when it was merged into Luster Municipality. Name The Old Norse form of the name was probably . The first element is then the genitive of Jastra (the old name of the river Josted√∏la) and the last element is dalr which means \\"valley\\" or \\"dale\\". The river name is probably derived from j«´str which means \\"yeast\\". The water in the river comes from glaciers, and in summer time the river gets \\"frothy\\" or \\"foamy\\" due to all of the melting ice and the many waterfalls. Transportation The route through Jostedal, Norwegian highway 604, brings one directly to the foot of Nigardsbreen, a tongue of Jostedalsbreen glacier and the museum Breheimsenteret. There is also a bus connection to the glacier in summer. The road through Jostedalen offers some of the most magnificent views of the Norwegian fjord landscape with towering mountains and spectacular waterfalls. At the end of the road is the breath-taking sight of the blue ice at the mouth of the Nigardsbreen glacial tongue. Geography The Jostedalen valley empties into the Gaupnefjord at the village of Gaupne. The Gaupnefjord is an arm of the Lustrafjorden, which is an arm of the famous Sognefjord, the second largest fjord in the world. There are three major glacial lakes in the area: Tunsbergdalsvatn, Nigardsbrevatn, and Styggevatn (vatn is Norwegian for lake). Other lakes in Jostdedal include Austdalsvatnet and Styggevatnet.

Jostedalsbreen National Park and Breheimen National Park are located on either side of the Jostedalen valley. =Farms of Jostedalen= Historically, and still occurring in present times, when owners of farms are no longer young enough to operate the farm, the title is either passed down to a younger family member or sold to a neighbour. Traditionally, the new operators of the farm assume the farm name as their new surname, and are often burdened with caring for the previous owners as part of the sale or transfer of title. Most of the farms near the village of Jostedal have been in operation for centuries: References External links * *https://web.archive.org/web/20080706032251/http://www.jostedal.com/ Category:Luster, Norway Category:Valleys of Vestland ","title":"Jostedalen"},{"id":"61915713","text":"Chains are seen as a symbol for racial uplift. The top link of the chain is connected to the link below it. Representing how African Americans are expected, once they have received an education, to come back and help another African American who did not receive those same opportunities. Also known as a chain effect, spreading the information that was taught to you to help bring the race up as a whole. Racial Uplift, can be defined as a term within the African American community that motivates educated blacks to be responsible in the lifting of their race. This concept traced back to the late 1800s, introduced by black elites such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and African American musicians like Florence Price who are known to be significant contributors. This concept is displayed by African Americans as a mean of assisting themselves to reach new heights in life. During the beginnings of racial uplift, hymns and negro spirituals played a vital role in shaping the spiritual culture of African Americans. Although these musical selections are mainly prevalent inside the black church, contemporary gospel music has been utilized for the liberation and uplift of the oppressed black race. Aside from music, African American leaders have used concepts such as Du Bois's double consciousness that describe the idea of blackness and the complexities of identity in the various lens in which the black race envisions themselves in American society. In the means of racial uplift, double consciousness is a struggle of racial uplift because it leaves the opportunity to believe that there is a superior race, which would look at you differently due to your skin. The talented tenth is a primary example of racial uplift for African Americans. Du Bois was one of the black elites that steered the talented tenth to become prevalent and of importance. Struggling to make racial uplift become relevant, he believed that the black leaders that were sent out to be representatives of their community did not always return to their communities.  Eugenics and its Correlation with Racial Uplift  Eugenics is seen throughout the time of racial uplift due to the control that was placed on people of African American descent. Eugenics play a role in how racial uplift is viewed which includes how people are made to think, look, and create community. Some African Americans, both then and now, are said to take on roles which are prevailing in other cultures, making them alter the way in which they choose to live their life. In W.E.B Du Bois's novel titled The Souls of Black Folk he discusses his view on how African American are perceived both to themselves and to the ones whom are around them, with the term double consciousness. Du Bois himself is known to many as the father of Sociology and Pan-Africanism, which has been seen around the world and is the idea of all people from African descent becoming unified. Other African American authors such as Nathan Hare have written novels which attest to eugenics not only being seen in the African American community, but also its promoter of liberation through racial uplift. In Nathan Hare's The Black Anglo-Saxons, he writes about how African Americans had begun conform to with other races and abandon their own cultural identity. Although they are now seen as a higher class, these individuals have refused to step up and guide other African Americans to where they are, which is the concept of racial uplift. This novel like many other Nathan Hare novels, has caused African Americans to realize that not everyone who succeeds in life is willing to come back and give to their community. Nathan Hare himself, has written many books which deal with the concept of racial uplift and how African Americans operate in a society where eugenics exist.  The effects of the Beauty Culture on Racial Uplift  With racial uplift being seen as a \\"self-help\\" for black people, there were also other aspects which focused on what African Americans were able to go out and receive an education. The beauty culture played a big role in who was sent out as a representative for the African American community. In W.E.B. Du Bois's novel The Souls of Black Folk, he uses this same idea to state how hair type, color, and attitude determined who was capable of receiving an education and could return to help the black community with lifting one another up. If the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù individuals are sent out, then the community is looked at as doomed due to that individual's incapability to perform at a certain level. Touching on eugenics, many African Americans were unaware of how the way they look, their mannerisms, and how they interact with those around them affect their capability to be well educated. With the color of a person's skin being the first physical feature people seen during this time, a rise of colorism, which is a contradicting approach to racial uplift. = Colorism = Colorism, sometimes known as Shadism, is when someone is being treated differently due to the color of their skin by someone in their own race. Due to the time period that colorism occurred, people of light shades are said to be more favorable and according to W.E.B. Du Bois, these were the individuals that would have an easier time with receiving an education. Then, take that same knowledge that they learned and teach the community they live in. During this time, a test known as the \\"brown paper bag test\\" was used to see the shade of an African American. This test was not only used to attend Historically Black Colleges during the late 1800s and early 1900s, but also to be seen as a leader or relevant to their own kind. In connection with eugenics, colorism is a form of discrimination that excludes someone because of being a darker shade. With racial uplift, it is challenging for African Americans to uplift one another if they are concentrating on one's skin tone. References Category:Sociological terminology  Links  *W. E. B.

Born into an intellectual family in 1874, she completed the schooling available to her in Tiflis and then worked for a time in Didi Jikhaishi as a Russian language teacher. In 1903, she went to study dentistry in Moscow, where she became involved in the revolutionary student movement during the 1905 Russian Revolution. Returning to Tiflis the following year, she began to meet women writers and activists participating in the struggle for women's rights. She joined the Union of Georgian Women for Equal Rights in 1906, but three years later left the organization and co-founded the Caucasian Women's Society with a breakaway group of feminists. As chair of the new society, Tkeshelashvili was active in the struggle for women's suffrage, in advancing the education of workers and the poor, working towards improved employment conditions and higher education for women, while addressing concerns in connection with women's health and sexuality. Around 1912, she began contributing to magazines and newspapers, addressing the issues facing women. With developments following the 1917 Russian Revolution, feminists hoped that the new Georgian Republic would heed their demands for civic and political equality. Instead, state policy created the Zhenotdel (Women's Bureau) in 1919, which limited women's free participation in society. Together with other feminists, Tkeshelashvili continued to press for equal participation until Stalin's state policies abolished the Zhenotdel and neutralized their efforts. She turned to writing, mainly writing for children in the Soviet era. When the Soviet Union dissolved, Georgian feminists rediscovered the history of Tkeshelashvili and other early associates. Early life Nino Tkeshelashvili was born in 1874 in Tiflis (known after 1936 as Tblisi) in the Caucasus Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire. Her father, whose family had been priests in the Georgian Orthodox Church, worked in agriculture and was an avid reader. Her mother was a close relative of the poet Akaki Tsereteli. From a young age, Tkeshelashvili enjoyed reading works from her father's library and was influenced by displaced revolutionaries who were frequent visitors in her parents' home. These included Ilia Bakhtadze, a journalist using the pen name Ilia Khoneli; the novelist Leo Kiacheli; and Archil Abashidze. She attended their discussions and dreamed of going to Russia to attend high school, like her brother. Though she completed the local school and earned a medal, she was unable to attend teacher training courses. Olga Guramishvili-Nikoladze and Niko Nikoladze (1870-1880) Through her parents, Tkeshelashvili met Niko Nikoladze, who was living in Didi Jikhaishi, in the Imereti region of western Georgia with his wife, Olga Guramishvili- Nikoladze (, 1855-1940) one of the first Georgian women to study abroad. Educated in Switzerland, Guramishvili returned to Georgia, where she was involved in pedagogy. She became a mentor to Tkeshelashvili, encouraging her to become a Russian-language teacher at the school she headed in Didi Jikhaishi. Besides teaching, she actively participated in literary evenings and read books from Nikoladze's library. In 1903, Tkeshelashvili went to Moscow, finally able to attend courses at dental school. She became involved in student radicalism and agitated with the intelligentsia for democratic reforms. At the end of the 1905 Russian Revolution, Tsar Nicholas conceded to terms that created the Duma, which had legislative oversight, while protecting freedom of conscience, speech, and assembly for the citizenship. Career Returning to Tiflis in 1906, Tkeshelashvili found that the movement to expand civil and political rights had reached Georgia. She lived in a boarding house belonging to Ivane Machabeli. One of the other tenants, , was closely involved in public works projects. Demuria worked as a journalist and regularly gave lectures to the general public. She also ran a Sunday school to offer education to workers and hired Tkeshelashvili to teach Russian language courses. Through her work with Demuria, Tkeshelashvili gained a wider circle of friends and met other women writers, like Ekaterine Gabashvili, who was involved in the feminist movement. She joined the Union of Georgian Women for Equal Rights, which began planning a conference for all Russian women to be held in Tiflis in 1908. Tkeshelashvili gave the opening address, calling on women to work for their freedom and cultural development. After the conference, recognizing that they wanted a more international approach than the Union of Georgian Women offered, a group led by Tkeshelashvili parted in 1909 to form the Caucasian Women's Society () (CWS). Among the 135 founding members were Gabashvili, Babilina Khositashvili, Nino Kipiani and Kato Mikeladze. Besides supporting women's suffrage, the CWS established clubs for working women in which they taught literacy and sewing. Tkeshelashvili hosted literary evenings where speakers presented talks on the Russian classics. The CWS also mounted a strong campaign to uphold women's \\"moral standards\\", labeling prostitution a \\"social evil\\". They invited women to attend debates that discussed social issues such as prostitution, education for the poor, employment conditions, higher education, and women's health and sexuality, among other topics. Georgian women writers (1925-1928), Tkeshelashvili is on the back row 2nd from the right Around 1912, Tkeshelashvili began publishing translations and original works in ·Éô·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò (Trace) and the children's magazine ·ÉØ·Éî·ÉØ·Éò·Éö·Éò (Jejili, meaning \\"wheat shoots\\"), founded by Anastasia Tumanishvili- Tsereteli. That year, she also joined the editorial staff of ·Éú·Éê·Éô·Éê·Éì·É£·Éö·Éò (The Stream), where she met writers Nino Nakashidze and Akaki Tsereteli. Writing under the pseudonym ·É°·É£·É§·É†·Éê·Éü·Éò·É°·É¢·Éô·Éê·É° (Suffragist), Tkeshelashvili published works urging the political and civic equality of women. In 1914, during World War I, the Caucasian Women's Society began operating free canteens and sewing clothes for soldiers. Tkeshelashvili also increased her literary output, writing for such journals as the Reference Sheet, The Rock, Theater and Life, and the Voice of Georgian Woman among others. One of her articles from the period, ·É•·Éê·Éö·Éò ·É†·Éî·Éï·Éù·Éö·É£·É™·Éò·Éù·Éú·É£·É† ·Éô·É£·Éö·É¢·É£·É†·Éò·É° ·É§·É†·Éù·Éú·É¢·Éñ·Éî (A Woman at the Front of Revolutionary Culture), evaluated women's economic dependence on men and confinement by social roles which tied them to the family. She postulated that Lenin's revolutionary ideas would free women from laws that were discriminatory. Tkeshelashvili took courses at the Kutaisi Women's Gymnasium and between 1917 and 1918 was active in the Georgian independence movement, following the collapse of the Russian Empire at the end of the 1917 Revolution. When the Democratic Republic of Georgia was being formed, she participated in the district elections for the Social Democratic Party of Georgia, held at the Gymnasium, and was shocked that out of 20 candidates there was only one woman. When she lamented the numbers to the audience, the party chair asked her to name qualified candidates. Tkeshelashvili gave him five names, but none were added to the ballot. She and other members of the Caucasian Women's Society cut all ties with the Social Democratic Party, recognizing that there was no genuine interest in their goals. Instead, the Party began promoting their own policies and became increasingly hostile to grassroots initiatives. In 1919 the Zhenotdel was founded which enacted government policies from the top down ignoring the real needs of women. The feminists continued to fight vigorously for their rights, meeting in private homes to discuss how best to continue their struggle. At one such meeting, Tkeshelashvili presented a story, ·Éõ·Éí·Éê·Éö·Éù·Éë·Éî·Éö·Éò ·É©·Éò·É¢·Éî·Éë·Éò·É° ·Éñ·Éî·Éò·Éõ·Éò (Mourning Birds Celebration) in which other women acted out the parts. It was an allegory of the feminist struggle and after its presentation, the other women dubbed her the ·Éõ·Éî·É†·É™·ÉÆ·Éê·Éö·Éê·É° (the Swallow), which she took on as a new pseudonym. In 1924, she wrote and participated in the public mock-trial, ·É•·É†·Éò·É°·É¢·Éò·Éú·Éî·É° ·Éí·Éê·É°·Éê·Éõ·Éê·É†·Éó·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éê (Judging Christine) in which she protested the remnants of capitalism that continued to victimize women. The performance was very popular and was presented at theaters and workers' palaces. In 1930, Stalin abolished the Zhenotdel, effectively neutralizing the women's movement. Officially, a woman's primary obligation became motherhood and domestic work, a secondary function being social productivity. Feminists transformed from seeking equality to writing children's fiction, as it was an approved activity for women. From that time, Tkeshelashvili wrote children's short stories and fables, which were run as features in Georgian magazines and newspapers. Her best works were ·ÉÆ·É£·ÉÆ·É£·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò (Hooks) and ·Éê·É°·Éö·Éê·Éõ·Éê·Éñ·Éê (Alamosa) but other well-known pieces included ·É°·Éû·Éò·Éö·Éù ·Éì·Éê ·Éõ·É¢·Éê·É™·Éî·Éë·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò (Elephant and Predators), ·Éõ·Éí·Éê·Éö·Éù·Éë·Éî·Éö·Éò ·É©·Éò·É¢·Éî·Éë·Éò (Mourning Birds), and ·Éï·Éò·É†·Éò (Donkey). Death and legacy Tkeshelashvili died in her home town in 1956. Like most feminists of the times, her activism for women's rights was forgotten in the Soviet era. Her 1990 biography listed her as a writer but since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Georgian feminists have been exploring their past and reclaiming the stories of early contributors like Tkeshelashvili.

In 1851 the historian S. –ê. Serebrenikov wrote of the icon \\"[it is] remarkable for its antiquity and its particularities in comparison to other stylistically similar icons - the silver riza of the archangel added in 1808, his crown, his silver and gilt zertsalo with precious stones and pearls\\". The riza he mentions is now lost - they were designed to protect icons from kisses by the faithful, but were often removed when icons were moved into museums. Like other precious antiquities from Iaroslavl, it was removed from its church and moved to the Tretiakov Gallery. Despite some paint loss, it was relatively well-conserved.

Okungbowa in 1989) is a Nigerian science fiction, fantasy and dark fiction writer. He is the author of The Nameless Republic epic fantasy trilogy, beginning with Son of the Storm (Orbit, May 2021). His debut was the godpunk fantasy novel, David Mogo, Godhunter (Abaddon, July 2019). His work is heavily influenced by the histories and cultures of West Africa and Nigeria, and discusses themes of identity, challenging difference and finding home. WIRED's Peter Rubin referred to him as \\"one of the most promising new voices coterie of African SFF writers.\\"  Early life  Okungbowa was born and raised in Benin City, Edo State in the southern part of Nigeria. His early life orbited around the University of Benin where his parents worked, and he then went on to obtain a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from the same university between 2006 and 2011. He later moved to Minna, Niger State and then, Lagos. He went on to study at the University of Arizona in Tucson for an MFA in Creative Writing.  Personal life  Okungbowa currently lives and works in Tucson, Arizona. Prior to that, he lived in Lagos, Nigeria and has worked in various fields, from construction engineering to professional services in finance to marketing communications to digital learning in nonprofit. He is married.  David Mogo, Godhunter (Abaddon, 2019)  Suyi Davies Okungbowa's debut novel, David Mogo, Godhunter was released by the Abaddon imprint of Rebellion Publishing in Oxford, UK on July 9, 2019 in the US and two days later in the UK and Europe. The novel follows the titular demigod, who is also a god hunter, as he scours the streets of Okungbowa's native Lagos, Nigeria, in the aftermath of an event called The Falling where thousands of orishas‚ÄîYoruba deities‚Äîhave fallen to the city. The novel received mixed reception, with venues like WIRED commenting that, \\"a number of books have been termed 'godpunk,' but Suyi Davies Okungbowa's novel may be the subgenre's platonic deific ideal,\\" while Publisher's Weekly mentioned that \\"this story is captivating, and readers who enjoy non-Western fantasy, mythpunk, and tales of found family will find it delightful.\\" However, there were critical mentions of the story structure, which was a novel in three parts, almost akin to a collection of novellas (F(r)iction's Giancarlo Riccobon called it \\"three books for the price of one\\") and the treatment of some of the minor characters. But overall, the consensus was that the authorial voice was fresh and welcome, especially in a white- dominated sub-genre. \\"American urban fantasy, like any established genre, can get predictable,\\" L.E.H Light of BlackNerdProblems said in a lengthy, favourable review. \\"David Mogo, Godhunter is anything but.\\"  The Nameless Republic trilogy (Orbit, 2021-present)  In January 2020, Orbit Books (a science fiction and fantasy imprint of Hachette Book Group, USA and Little, Brown UK) announced the acquisition of \\"an incredible new epic fantasy series\\" from Okungbowa. They referred to The Nameless Republic as \\"an evocative tale of myth and magic [that] invites readers into a rich and vibrant world inspired by West-African empires.\\" Okungbowa himself commented: \\"This series is my love letter to all of us who know the magic that makes West-Africa tick‚Äìthe lore and music, the harmattan and petrichor, the jollof rice and fried plantain.\\" The first of these books, Son of the Storm, is slated for release in May 2021.

During his time as an undergraduate he worked with Steven D. Tanksley studying tomatoes. He joined the research group of Robert A. Martienssen at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he studied the role of the DDM1 gene in methylation of transposons and how this process can alter the expression of other nearby genes. After completing his PhD in 2004, Lippman was a postdoc with Dani Zamir at Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he studied genes controlling branching in tomatoes. Lippman was hired as a principal investigator at Cold Spring Harbor in 2008.  Research  Lippman's research group, collaborating with Joyce Van Eck at the Boyce Thompson Institute used genome editing to improve domestication traits in the wild ground cherry, Physalis pruinosa. They targeted three genes known to be important in the domestication of tomato. The first gene made plants more compact and caused them to produce fruit in clusters rather than individually. The second gene increased the number of fruit produced per unit of stem. The final of the three genes increased the size of the fruit by increasing the number of seed compartments inside of each fruit.https://www.cshl.edu/crispr- could-bring-groundcherries-to- market/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/science/groundcherries-crispr-gene- editing.html  Awards  * Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator (2018) * MacArthur Fellowship, commonly referred to as a \\"Genius grant\\" (2019). * National Academy of Sciences, Prize in Food and Agricultural Sciences (2020).

Foster and A.E. Foster) was a nineteenth century businessman and lumber tycoon known for helping to develop various lumber businesses.  Early life  Edward was born in Machias, Maine on August 10, 1830. His parents were Edward Foster and Fannie (Cilley) Foster. While growing up he spent most of his youth as a helper in his father's sawmills instead of going to a public school for formal training. Edward stayed with his parents until he was twenty years old.  Mid life  Edward went to Boston in 1850 and became employed as a crew member on a vessel heading to Puget Sound, Washington. The ship had sawmill machinery purchased by the lumber firm Pope & Talbot. The trip took six months and ended at Port Gamble, Washington. The equipment that the vessel carried was unloaded and set up as a sawmill. Edward, as an employee of the lumber firm, helped set up this sawmill as the first on the Pacific coast of the United States. Edward left Pop & Talbot in 1853 and traveled back east to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He ran a lumber business there with his brother Luther starting around 1855 and continued that until 1857. They then moved to Stiles, Wisconsin at Green Bay. There they worked as foremen for Holt & Balcom, Iverson & Whitcomb, and the Holt Lumber Company for seven years. Edward with his brother Luther crossed Lake Michigan in 1865 and went to Muskegon, Michigan where they worked for S. N. Wilcox as foremen for about a year. They then went north to the village of Pere Marquette in northwestern Michigan. The village later became the town of Ludington, Michigan. Edward bought into the Pere Marquette Lumber Company with his brother when it was organized in 1866. Other partners of the new lumber company were D.L. Filer, John Mason Loomis, John McLaren, and James Ludington. Edward sold his part in the Pere Marquette Lumber Company in 1872 and formed the company Foster & Stanchfield. He sold his ownership part in this firm in 1876 and in 1877 started a new company called E.A. Foster & Company and manufactured shingles. Edward left the field in 1881 for about a year due to poor health. Then in 1883 he purchased T.H. Sheppard's interest in the lumber firm A.R. Gray & Company in Chicago. He was associated with that firm with his son Harry through 1884. Edward with his son Harry bought into the McDonald Lumber Company at Wausau, Wisconsin in 1885 and sold it 1886. Then he formed the Merrill Lumber Company. This company took over the sawmill ownership of the Lincoln Lumber Company at Merrill, Wisconsin. It included a large tract of white pine timber. They began to produce lumber with the sawmill. Edward was president of the company they formed in 1888 and a manager in the Merrill Boom Company. Edward was one of the partners and original managers of the Red Cliff Lumber Company. They manufactured lumber at Redcliff, Wisconsin.  Personal life  Edward had married a childhood friend in 1856, Laura Helen. They raised six children. Laura died in 1898. Edward died December 21, 1902. At that time he had ownership in the Arkansas Land & Lumber Company, the Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber Company, and the Wausau Everett Investment Company in Washington.

Foster) was a nineteenth century businessman and lumber tycoon known for helping to develop various lumber businesses.  Early life and education  Luther was born at East Machias, Maine on May 31, 1827. His parents were Edward Foster and Fannie Foster. He began kindergarten at three and attended the local public schools until he was seventeen years old. Luther had an aptitude in mathematics and mechanics. Luther took up the study of music when he was a boy, influenced by his father who was an accomplished musician. He purchased a reed instrument called a seraphine at about eighteen. Luther ultimately became a talented musician.  Business career  Luther with his brother Edward went to Ridgway, Pennsylvania in 1851 to work in the lumber industry. There they rented a small old fashion sawmill to run. They worked up to eighteen hours a day and had one employee. They produced between the three of them about 6,000 to 8,000 board feet of lumber per day. Later in 1855 they moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin and were managers of a lumbering business until 1857. Luther and his brother then moved to Stiles, Wisconsin on the shore of Green Bay where they were worked for seven years for Holt & Balcom, Iverson & Whitcomb, and the Holt Lumber Company. Luther and his brother Edward crossed Lake Michigan in 1865 and went to Muskegon, Michigan There they worked for S. N. Wilcox for about a year at the Eldred and Farr Lumber Company. They then went north in 1866 to the village of Pere Marquette in northwestern Michigan. The village later became the town of Ludington, Michigan. The place at the time was all forests except for a small village around a sawmill. They were hired by the lumber tycoon James Ludington to manage his vast real estate and lumber interests. Ludington had deteriorating health and was having difficulty in handling his affairs. They devised a business plan for the management of Ludington's timber holdings and local real estate. They presented the plan to Delos L. Filer and the result was the organization in 1869 of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company. The capital raised for the new company was $500,000 to buy Ludington's interests and holdings. The partners of the new company were besides Luther and his brother Edward, D. L. Filer, John Mason Loomis, John McLaren and Ludington. = James Ludington's letters = Ludington wrote letters from Wisconsin to Luther as to business matters concerning the management of his interests at Pere Marquette, Michigan. He lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Luther was his business manager in Michigan. They communicated back and forth by letters that traveled by ship across Lake Michigan. In the Ludington letter from Racine, Wisconsin, to Luther of December 6, 1866, he expresses his confidence in him to manage his Michigan affairs correctly. Ludington in his letter to Luther of January 9, 1867, addressed it to Pere Marquette, Michigan, but put on top in parenthesis the word \\"Ludington\\" dropping the hint that perhaps the village of Pere Marquette should be changed to the town of \\"Ludington\\" in his honor. In 1873 there was an election that officially incorporated the village as the city of Ludington.  Personal life  Luther married Lucy Amelia Schraam in Camden, New York on May 25, 1855.(Ref: History of Northern Mich by Powers) Luther built an elegant residence across the street from the Per Marquette Lumber Company's \\"Big Store\\", that his wife and their two sons, Frank and Edward, continued to occupy even after his death. Luther became a member of the Ludington Presbyterian Church and took a prominent part in religious affairs. Luther with his wife and their two children and three other children organized the first Sunday school in Ludington. He was a leader of the Sunday schools in Ludington for his lifetime. Luther assisted to organize a Congregational Church in Ludington in 1870. He was active in its support until 1874, when the Ludington Presbyterian Church was organized and he became a member of that church. Luther at one time was the Ludington commissioner under the Michigan land commissioner. He supported the Republican party.  Later life and death  Luther was assassinated by burglars on the morning of June 20, 1876. The burglars broke into his house and woke him up in the early morning hours. He pursued them as they ran away from his house and was shot dead by one of them. It turned out the burglars took a specific ledger known later as \\"Foster's Black Book\\" where Luther was about to become a whistle blower of corruption, similar to that of the Wisconsin Black Book case of 1856.  Legacy  Luther was in charge of platting the city of Ludington when it was still a village called Pere Marquette. He also named all the main streets of Ludington. Luther played a major role in getting the city of Ludington to become the seat for Mason County, Michigan. One of the city of Ludington's school buildings is named Luther H. Foster, noting his zealous involvement in the city's schools and churches. Foster Street in the city of Ludington is named after the pioneer lumberman Luther Hall Foster.

He is consistently cited as one of the first and the most influential rappers of Nepal and was labeled the \\"godfather of Nephop\\" by The Diplomat Magazine. Khatiwada started his career at the age of 15 with his first track \\"Meaningless Rap\\" in 1994 and became mainstream with his counterpart Pranil Timalsena with other tracks like Timi Jaha Pani Jaanchhau, Malai Bhot Deu, Hami Dherai Sana Chhu. Today, besides his career in the Nepalese rap music scene, Khatiwada is also one of the most influential vloggers from Nepal.  Life and career  Girish Khatiwada was born on August 30, 1979 in Biratnagar, Nepal. In an interview with The Kathmandu Post, Girish said that he was introduced to hip hop music of the west in early 1990s when he was involved in break dancing in Dharan. His first introduction of hip-hop came from a cousin whose parents worked in the Nepali embassy in Washington. In 1994, at the age of 15, Girish wrote and recorded the first hip-hop song, Meaningless Rap. According to Girish, the song was named so because he initially struggled to understand the obscure slang in English hip hop which he presumed were written and sang only to rhyme and didn't have any meaning. After a moderate success, he was approached by a local record label to produce a full album. This resulted in a team of Girish and Pranil, who were later known by their moniker GP. During the late 90s, GP took inspiration for their music from the instrumental parts of American hip-hop who would then incorporate traditional Nepali folk song with the help of Nepali audio engineers. This led to the formation of a new Nepali music genre \\"Nep hop\\" in the late 90s, which he later named \\"Lok Hop.\\" Khatiwada took a break from Nepali hip hop to continue his higher studies in United States in 2008.

These processes play a prominent role in both freshwater and marine ecosystems and are influenced by a number of chemical, biological, and physical forces that are crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs.  Description  The benthic and pelagic zones are interconnected through nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate) exchange from the sediment that help fuel phytoplankton primary production in the water column, which in turn, provide organic substrate for regeneration in sediments by microbes and macrofauna. These exchanges have seasonal variability as temperature and light conditions that drive primary production and sedimentation patterns change. Accumulation of nutrients during winter months generally results in a strong peak in phytoplankton production in spring followed by a peak in sedimentation. In the summer, pelagic recycling of primary production is more efficient and sedimentation generally lower. The depth of an aquatic ecosystem is a key factor for benthic-pelagic exchanges because it determines the proximity and degree of interactions between the two environments. Coupling is stronger in shallow waters, such as in lakes and in coastal areas because primary productivity is generally higher in these areas where a higher amount of fresh organic matter from either photosynthesis or fecal matter can reach the bottom to fuel benthic fauna, which in turn remineralize and respire organic matter that supplies essential nutrients for primary production at the surface. Stratification of the water column, whether by temperature or salinity, also regulates the degree of exchange between benthic and pelagic habitats. Oxygen concentrations and biological interactions, such as predation and competition, will also influence benthic community structure and biomass. For example, benthic macrofauna, such as polychaetes and bivalves, are important food sources for demersal fish, including commercially important species such as flatfish and cod.  Mechanisms  = Organism movement = Diel vertical migrations (DVM) of fishes, zooplankton, and larger invertebrates, such as cephalopods and jellyfish, from the surface to the bottom can transfer nutrients and detritus from the pelagic zone to the benthos. Zooplankton, for example, vertically transport items such as organic carbon, nutrients, parasites, and food resources throughout the water column. Particulates (fecal pellets) and dissolved organic carbon produced by these organisms in the water column constitute marine snow, which supports microbial production at the benthos in what is known as the 'biological pump.' These daily migrations are along a vertical gradient were movements are typically downward by day and an upward at night in response to several factors, such as predator avoidance, food availability, and light intensity. Movement driven by life-history stages and feeding patterns also plays a role in benthic-pelagic coupling. Many aquatic organisms inhabit have both pelagic and benthic life stages, such as benthic macrofauna that have pelagic larval stages before settling on the sediment. Organisms who occupy both benthic and pelagic habitats as part of their life history help maintain adult populations and community structure, and serve as inputs essential for ecological interactions such as predation, competition, and parasitism. Sediment-dwelling organisms are also involved in benthic- pelagic coupling by disturbing the sediment to feed on organic matter trapped between sediment grains or to hide from predators. This is known as bioturbation, which stimulates mineralization of organic matter and the release of nutrients (Hansen et al. 1998; Lohrer et al. 2004; D‚ÄôAndrea and DeWitt 2009), thereby affecting the growth of phytoplankton in the pelagic zone (Welsh 2003). Bioturbation by macrofauna affects sediment permeability and water content, destabilizes chemical gradients, subducts organic matter, and influences rates of remineralization and inorganic nutrient flux. Collectively, these outcomes are essential to habitat productivity and overall ecosystem function. = Trophic interactions = How organisms interact will also determine the degree of benthic-pelagic coupling. These interactions will differ based largely on the species involved. In both freshwater and marine ecosystems, there are benthic organisms that are preyed upon by both demersal and pelagic fish during various life stages. Benthic organisms can also prey upon pelagic species. Benthic suspension feeders, such as bivalves, can exert considerable grazing pressure on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. Thus, benthic and pelagic fauna can act as habitat couplers by consuming resources originating from either the water column or the sediment. On rocky intertidal shores, the effects of nearshore currents on phytoplankton and sea star propagules influence the benthic community structure of mussels and predation pressure by sea stars. Detritivores inhabiting benthic areas derive energy from sinking pelagic detritus and are then consumed by either benthic or pelagic predators, impacting community structure. Benthic and pelagic domains are further linked by pelagic predators such as tuna and swordfish feeding also on demersal resources, while pelagic preys such as sardines and anchovies may feed demersal predators. = Biogeochemical cycling = The benthic biogeochemical processes are essentially driven by pelagic processes, fueled by the deposition of pelagic material (e.g., organic matter, calcium carbonate). In response, sediments transform the deposited material (such as through degradation and dissolution) back into nutrients available for uptake in the water column. Part of those products becomes available for bacterial and phytoplankton production that ultimately may sink to the seafloor to fuel the benthic communities again.  Anthropogenic and climate change impacts  Anthropogenic pressures regulate benthic‚Äìpelagic coupling directly and indirectly through their effects on the physical (e.g., salinity, oxygen, temperature) and biological (e.g., species, communities, functional traits) components of ecosystems. In coastal and estuarine ecosystems, climate change, nutrient loading, and fishing have been shown to have direct effects on benthic‚Äìpelagic coupling with clear consequences for ecosystem function. For example, increased water temperatures in Narragansett Bay have caused shifts in the timing and a decrease in the magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. This has decreased the deposition of organic material to the benthos and ultimately reduced inorganic nutrient release from the sediment. Projected changes in nutrients and salinity could have negative effects on the distribution and productivity of mussels and diminish their role in benthic‚Äìpelagic exchange. Overall, eutrophication results in an increase in phytoplankton biomass and blooms, altered phytoplankton community structure, and a decrease in benthic primary production.

The memorial is located in the \\"Olde Town\\" section of Augusta, Georgia, on the Broad Street median between Third and Fourth Streets. The monument was designed, purchased, and placed by the Augusta Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars (MOWW) and the chapter's 17 community partners who made up the Augusta-CSRA Vietnam War Memorial Initiative (VWMI) Steering Committee.  Memorial Objective  Augusta-CSRA Vietnam War Veterans Memorial. Front. March 29, 2019. The memorial's objective is to honor the service and sacrifice of the Augusta and Central Savannah River Area's (CSRA) U.S. military service members who served in Vietnam. The memorial was placed in support of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War (2012-2025), as declared by the U.S. Congress (Public Law 110-181, Section 598) and the Department of Defense's Vietnam War Commemoration program.  Memorial Structure and Inscriptions  The memorial's front center-right and center-left panels identify each of the 169 service members from the Augusta and Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) who lost their lives in Vietnam. The mid-center panel portrays a map of the Vietnam theater of operations and the inscription \\"Spirit of Freedom.\\" The far right and far left front panels depict the names of the region's three EX-POWs and one MIA, an engraving of \\"The Three Soldiers\\" statue in Washington, DC, and a quote from former President Ronald Reagan's commemoration address, delivered on the National Mall, November 11, 1984: \\"Those who fought in Vietnam are part of us, part of our history. They reflected the best in us. No number of wreaths, no amount of music and memorializing will ever do them justice, but it is good for us that we honor them and their sacrifice .... The men and women of Vietnam fought for freedom in a place where liberty was in danger. They put their lives in danger to help a people in a land far away from their own. Many sacrificed their lives in the name of duty, honor, and country. All were patriots who lit the world with their fidelity and courage.\\" Augusta-CSRA Vietnam War Veterans Memorial. Reverse. August 12, 2019. The reverse of the memorial recognizes each of the 5 branches of the Armed Services who fought in Vietnam, displays engraved period photographs from each service, and provides service statistics from each service branch. The reverse also displays the names of the 17 organizations who partnered with the Augusta Chapter of the MOWW for design, purchase, and placement of the monument. Bronze eagle sculpture titled \\"Spirit of Freedom\\" serves as the memorial's centerpiece. The memorial's centerpiece is a 220-pound solid bronze eagle sculpture titled, \\"Spirit of Freedom\\" which stands 3.5 feet high and has an expansive wingspan of 5 feet in length. The sculpture was purchased by a single donor from a bronze sculpture and art company located in California. Inscriptions beneath the bronze eagle sculpture read, \\"Spirit of Freedom\\" (front) and \\"God Bless the USA\\" (reverse). The memorial was finalized in August 2019, with the placement of a Vietnam-era bronze \\"Soldier's Cross,\\" a granite pedestal, 4 engraved granite benches, 4 additional granite mantle pieces, and 4 bronze recognition plaques.  Location Selection  The memorial's location was selected due to the site's close proximity to Augusta's \\"All Wars Monument,\\" \\"Korean War Monument,\\" and \\"Purple Heart Monument\\" and due to the historical significance of the \\"Olde Town\\" Augusta region.  Cost and Production  The memorial's cost of production was just over $100,000 which was raised entirely through donations and private contributions. The memorial was constructed by Star Granite and Bronze Company of Elberton, Georgia, a Matthews International Corporation subsidiary.  Dedication Ceremony  March 29, 2019 ‚Äì National Vietnam War Veterans Day ‚Äì was chosen for the memorial's unveiling and dedication ceremony due to the significance of the date to Vietnam War veterans and their families. The ceremony's keynote speaker was Major General James E. LivingstonU.S. Marine Corps (Ret), Medal of Honor Recipient (1970) for actions above and beyond the call of duty in the Republic of South Vietnam, May 1968. General Livingston was born and raised in Telfair County, Georgia and now resides in Charleston, South Carolina. The ceremony also included remarks from Augusta's Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr., Congressman Rick Allen of Georgia's 12th District, Commissioner Michael Roby of the Georgia Department of Veterans Service, and Brigadier General Christopher L.

History = Albanian revolt of 1432-1436 = The Albanian revolt of 1432‚Äì36 was a series of conflicts between Albanian rebels and the Ottoman Empire during the early period of Ottoman rule in the region. Prompted by the replacement of large parts of the local nobility with Ottoman landowners, centralized governance and the Ottoman taxation system, the population and the nobles, led principally by Gjergj Arianiti, revolted against the Ottomans. During the early phases of the revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled. As it spread, the nobles, whose holdings had been annexed by the Ottomans returned to join the revolt and attempts to form alliances with the Holy Roman Empire were initiated. While the leaders of the revolt were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokast√´r, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces from other parts of the empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt. After the revolt had largely been suppressed, those who accepted Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed to retain their holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Yakup Bey Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Theodor Corona Musachi in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead in part to the formation of the League of Lezh√´ under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman‚ÄìAlbanian wars.  Background  alt=Albania under Ottoman control in 1431 Gradually in the late 14th and early 15th century the Ottoman Empire defeated local Albanian principalities, forming the sanjak of Albania as an administrative division of the empire. As part of the Timar system the local feudal lords were largely replaced with Ottomans from Anatolia. The cadastral survey (defter) of 1431‚Äì1432 indicates that about 75% to 80% of the timars were granted to Ottoman Muslim spahis (feudal cavalry), while the remainder and especially remote areas, which were not under full Ottoman control, were granted to Albanian spahis, both Christian and Muslim. The replacement of the existing nobility with the timar system led to conflicts, as a result of which many rural areas were not under complete Ottoman rule. Under the previous taxation code, farmers were required to pay a tenth of their seasonal agricultural output, 1 ducat and 4 groshe (two-ninths of a ducat) to their lords. The Ottoman system aimed towards revenue increase to support military expenses, thus new taxes were imposed and existing ones were altered. In addition to 1/10 of agrarian production Muslim convert families were required to pay 22 ak√ße (~0.6 ducats) to the timar holders, while non-Muslim families had to pay 25 ak√ße (~0.7 ducats). Both groups were subject to additional taxes including the avarƒ±z, an annual cash tax that affected households registered to the cadasters. Non-Muslims were also required to pay 45 ak√ße (~1.3 ducats) as part of the jizya and had to supply regularly the Ottoman state with young recruits in accordance with the dev≈üirme, which required the enlistment of young males in the Ottoman army and their conversion to Islam. Consequently, the changes in property rights, relations between feudal lords and peasants, the taxation system and the enactment of dev≈üirme resulted in further resistance. As changes affecting both nobles and peasants were principally implemented through registration in the cadastral survey, many families tried to avoid becoming registered in the 1431‚Äì2 survey and took refugee in mountainous areas, while the nobility prepared for armed conflict.  Revolt  The castle of Gjirokast√´r was besieged by alt=Castle of Gjirokast√´r The revolt began in 1432 when Andrea Thopia defeated a small Ottoman force in central Albania. His victory encouraged the other leaders and the revolt spread throughout Albania. Later that year the Ottomans lost control of the central seaport of Vlor√´. Gjergj Arianiti, who was living at the Ottoman court as a hostage, was called by rebels to lead the revolt in his family's domains. In response, he fled from Edirne and returned to Albania. In the winter of 1432, Sultan Murat II gathered around 10.000 troops under Ali Bey, who marched along the Via Egnatia and reached the central valley of Shkumbin, where he was ambushed and defeated by forces under Gjergj Arianiti. His victory prompted the Albanians in the area of Gjirokast√´r to call upon Dep√´ Zenebishi, who had settled in his estates in Corfu after the Ottoman conquest of the Principality of Gjirokast√´r, to lead the rebels in the south. After spreading the revolt in nearby areas including K√´lcyr√´, Zagorie and Pogon his forces besieged the southern city of Gjirokast√´r, capital of the sanjak of Albania. At nearby K√´lcyr√´ the rebels captured the castle, but the concurrent siege of Gjirokast√´r was prolonged and Turahan Bey attacked and defeated the troops that surrounded the city in early 1433. Zenebishi himself was captured and executed. In the summer of 1433 an army led by Sinan Pasha, beylerbey of Rumelia, pillaged the areas of Kanina and Yannina and moved northwards, where they subdued the rebels in the domains of Gjon Kastrioti, who was reduced again to vassal status, while his son Skanderbeg, who was also called to join the revolt, remained in Ottoman service in Anatolia. In August 1433, the senate of Venice convened to evaluate the situation and deemed that the revolt posed a threat to the Venetian territories in the region too. However, by the end of October they reevaluated the crisis and rejected the deployment of a war galley to the Venetian colonies. In northern Albania Nicholas Dukagjini captured territories of the pre-Ottoman Principality of Dukagjini and besieged and captured Dagnum. Dukagjini then tried to ally himself with Venice by offering to accept Venetian suzerainty and granting them control of Dagnum. However, Venice refused any kind of involvement in his plan and the revolt in general. Dukagjini was not aware that Hasan Bey, the Ottoman governor of Dagnum, had requested Venetian assistance after his defeat. As Venice did not want to provoke Ottoman hostility, the captain of Shkod√´r (Scutari) was ordered to assist Hasan Bey in recapturing Dagnum. Arms were subsequently sent to the garrison of Lezh√´ (Alessio) and by 1435 the fort had been returned to Ottoman control. In central Albania, Andrea Thopia unsuccessfully besieged the castle of Kruj√´, while in the region of Vlor√´ the siege of the fort of Kanin√´ began. Vlor√´ was lost to the rebels as early as May 1432, but must have been recovered by May 1434 as contemporary Venetian documents mention an Ottoman official (suba≈üi) stationed there at that time. Another Ottoman army was assembled in Manastir in the summer of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti in south- central Albania in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering Albania were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of √úsk√ºb marched into south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as calm and noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories. During the revolt many attempts were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist the revolt and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a coalition with the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued the revolt and marched through Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians. = Skanderbeg's rebellion = Kenneth Meyer Setton claims that majority of accounts on Skanderbeg's activities in the period 1443‚Äì1444 \\"owe far more to fancy than to fact.\\"Setton p. 73. Soon after Skanderbeg captured Kruj√´ using the forged letter to take control from Zabel Pasha, his rebels managed to capture many Ottoman fortresses including strategically very important Svetigrad (Kod≈æad≈æik) taken with support of Moisi Arianit Golemi and 3,000 rebels from Debar. According to some sources, Skanderbeg impaled captured Ottoman officials who refused to be baptized into Christianity. The first battle of Skanderbeg's rebels against the Ottomans was fought on 10 October 1445, on mountain Mokra. According to Setton, after Skanderbeg was allegedly victorious in the Battle of Torvioll, the Hungarians are said to have sung praises about him and urged Skanderbeg to join the alliance of Hungary, the Papacy and Burgundy against the Ottomans. In the spring of 1446, using help of Ragusan diplomats, Skanderbeg requested support from the Pope and Kingdom of Hungary for his struggle against the Ottomans.  Rise  In early November 1443, Skanderbeg deserted the forces of Sultan Murad II during the Battle of Ni≈°, while fighting against the crusaders of John Hunyadi. According to some earlier sources, Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army during the Battle of Kunovica on 2 January 1444. Skanderbeg quit the field along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. He immediately led his men to Kruj√´, where he arrived on 28 November, and by the use of a forged letter from Sultan Murad to the Governor of Kruj√´ he became lord of the city that very day. To reinforce his intention of gaining control of the former domains of Zeta, Skanderbeg proclaimed himself the heir of the Bal≈°iƒá family. After capturing some less important surrounding castles (Petrela, Prez√´, Guri i Bardh√´, Svetigrad, Modriƒç, and others) he raised, according to Frash√´ri, a red standard with a black double-headed eagle on Kruj√´ (Albania uses a similar flag as its national symbol to this day). Skanderbeg abandoned Islam, reverted to Christianity, and ordered others who had embraced Islam or were Muslim colonists to convert to Christianity or face death.. \\"This happened in 1443 when Gjergj Kastrioti (called Skenderbeg), who had been reared as a Muslim in the sultan's palace, abandoned the Islamic faith and publicly reverted to the creed of his forefathers. But this conversion was not merely a public gesture of defiance. It was the first act in a revolutionary drama. For, after changing his religious allegiance, Skenderbeg demanded that Muslim colonists and converts alike embrace Christianity on pain of death, declaring a kind of holy war against the sultan/caliph.\\" From that time on, the Ottomans referred to Skanderbeg as \\"hain (treacherous) ƒ∞skender\\". The small court of Skanderbeg consisted of persons of various ethnicities. Ninac Vukosaliƒá, a Serb, was the dijak (\\"scribe\\", secretary) and chancellor at the court., Skanderbeg had under his command 7,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry. 3,000 cavalry were hidden behind enemy lines in a nearby forest under the command of Hamza Kastrioti. At a given signal, they descended, encircled the Ottomans, and gave Skanderbeg a much needed victory. About 8,000 Ottomans were killed and 2,000 were captured. Skanderbeg's first victory echoed across Europe because this was one of the few times that an Ottoman army was defeated in a pitched battle on European soil. On 10 October 1445 an Ottoman force of 9,000‚Äì15,000 men under Firuz Pasha was sent to prevent Skanderbeg from moving into Macedonia. Firuz had heard that the Albanian army had disbanded for the time being, so he planned to move quickly around the Black Drin valley and through Prizren. These movements were picked up by Skanderbeg's scouts, who moved to meet Firuz. The Ottomans were lured into the Mokra valley, and Skanderbeg with a force of 3,500 attacked and defeated the Ottomans. Firuz was killed along with 1,500 of his men. Skanderbeg defeated the Ottomans two more times the following year, once when Ottoman forces from Ohrid suffered severe losses, and again in the Battle of Otonet√´ on 27 September 1446.  War with Venice 1447 to 1448  At the beginning of the Albanian insurrection, the Republic of Venice was supportive of Skanderbeg, considering his forces to be a buffer between them and the Ottoman Empire. Lezh√´, where the eponymous league was established, was Venetian territory, and the assembly met with the approval of Venice. The later affirmation of Skanderbeg and his rise as a strong force on their borders, however, was seen as a menace to the interests of the Republic, leading to a worsening of relations and the dispute over the fortress of Dagnum which triggered the Albanian-Venetian War of 1447‚Äì48. After various attacks against Bar and Ulcinj, along with ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Stefan Crnojeviƒá, and Albanians of the area, the Venetians offered rewards for his assassination. The Venetians sought by every means to overthrow Skanderbeg or bring about his death, even offering a life pension of 100 golden ducats annually for the person who would kill him. During the conflict, Venice invited the Ottomans to attack Skanderbeg simultaneously from the east, facing the Albanians with a two-front conflict. Woodcut depicting an engagement between Albanian and Ottoman forces On 14 May 1448, an Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad II and his son Mehmed laid siege to the castle of Svetigrad. The Albanian garrison in the castle resisted the frontal assaults of the Ottoman army, while Skanderbeg harassed the besieging forces with the remaining Albanian army under his personal command. On 23 July 1448, Skanderbeg won a battle near Shkod√´r against a Venetian army led by Andrea Venier. In late summer 1448, due to a lack of potable water, the Albanian garrison eventually surrendered the castle with the condition of safe passage through the Ottoman besieging forces, a condition which was accepted and respected by Sultan Murad II. Primary sources disagree about the reason why the besieged had problems with the water in the castle: While Barleti and Biemmi maintained that a dead dog was found in the castle well, and the garrison refused to drink the water since it might corrupt their soul, another primary source, an Ottoman chronicler, conjectured that the Ottoman forces found and cut the water sources of the castle. Recent historians mostly concur with the Ottoman chronicler's version. Although his loss of men was minimal, Skanderbeg lost the castle of Svetigrad, which was an important stronghold that controlled the fields of Macedonia to the east. At the same time, he besieged the towns of Durazzo (modern Durr√´s) and Lezh√´ which were then under Venetian rule. In August 1448, Skanderbeg defeated Mustafa Pasha in Dib√´r at the battle of Oranik. Mustafa Pasha lost 3,000 men and was captured, along with twelve high officers. Skanderbeg learned from these officers that it was the Venetians who pushed the Ottomans to invade Albania. The Venetians, upon hearing of the defeat, urged to establish peace. Mustafa Pasha was soon ransomed for 25,000 ducats to the Ottomans. Skanderbeg addressing the people, 16th-century engraving by Jost Amman On 23 July 1448 Skanderbeg crossed the Drin River with 10,000 men, meeting a Venetian force of 15,000 men under the command of Daniele Iurichi, governor of Scutari. Skanderbeg instructed his troops on what to expect and opened battle by ordering a force of archers to open fire on the Venetian line. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress. The Albanians managed to inflict 2,500 casualties on the Venetian force, capturing 1,000. Skanderbeg's army suffered 400 casualties, most on the right wing. The peace treaty, negotiated by Georgius Pelino and signed between Skanderbeg and Venice on 4 October 1448, envisioned that Venice would keep Dagnum and its environs, but would cede to Skanderbeg the territory of Buz√´gjarpri at the mouth of the river Drin, and also that Skanderbeg would enjoy the privilege of buying, tax-free, 200 horse- loads of salt annually from Durazzo. In addition Venice would pay Skanderbeg 1,400 ducats. During the period of clashes with Venice, Skanderbeg intensified relations with Alfonso V of Aragon (r. 1416‚Äì1458), who was the main rival of Venice in the Adriatic, where his dreams for an empire were always opposed by the Venetians. One of the reasons Skanderbeg agreed to sign the peace treaty with Venice was the advance of John Hunyadi's army in Kosovo and his invitation for Skanderbeg to join the expedition against the sultan. However, the Albanian army under Skanderbeg did not participate in this battle as he was prevented from joining with Hunyadi's army. It is believed that he was delayed by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, then allied with Sultan Murad II, although Brankovic's exact role is disputed. As a result, Skanderbeg ravaged his domains as a punishment for the desertion of the Christian cause. He appears to have marched to join Hunyadi immediately after making peace with the Venetians, and to have been only 20 miles from Kosovo Polje when the Hungarian army finally broke.Malcolm, Noel. Kosovo: A Short History, 1998, pp 89‚Äì90  Italian expedition 1460 to 1462  Skanderbeg's military expedition to Italy 1460‚Äî1462. The Northern route was taken by himself, whereas the southern one was taken by his subordinates. In 1457, Skanderbeg had achieved his most famous victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Uj√´bardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son by sending a military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce and he was still sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy. Due to fears of an approaching Ottoman army, Skanderbeg first sent his nephew, Constantine, with 500 cavalry to Barletta. They were incorporated into Ferdinand's forces to combat his Angevin rivals. They held back their enemy for a year, but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461. Before reaching Italy, Skanderbeg visited Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign. Meanwhile, his men landed in Italy and Angevin forces lifted their siege on Barletta. Upon arriving, Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally's enemies with great success. Ferdinand's adversaries thus began to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of Orsara, although it is not known if Skanderbeg's men participated. In 1460, King Ferdinand had serious problems with another uprising of the Angevins and asked for help from Skanderbeg. This invitation worried King Ferdinand's opponents, and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta declared that if Ferdinand of Naples received Skanderbeg, Malatesta would go to the Ottomans. In the month of September 1460, Skanderbeg dispatched a company of 500 cavalry under his nephew, Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá.Ferdinand's main rival Prince of Taranto Giovanni Antonio Orsini tried to dissuade Skanderbeg from this enterprise and even offered him an alliance. This did not affect Skanderbeg, who answered on 31 October 1460, that he owed fealty to the Aragon family, especially in times of hardship. In his response to Orsini, Skanderbeg mentioned that the Albanians never betray their friends, and that they are the descendants of Pyrrhus of Epirus, and reminded Orsini of Pyrrhus' victories in southern Italy. When the situation became critical, Skanderbeg made a three-year armistice with the Ottomans on 17 April 1461, and in late August 1461, landed in Apulia with an expeditionary force of 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry. At Barletta and Trani, he managed to defeat the Italian and Angevin forces of Orsini of Taranto, secured King Ferdinand's throne, and returned to Albania. King Ferdinand was grateful to Skanderbeg for this intervention for the rest of his life: at Skanderbeg's death, he rewarded his descendants with the castle of Trani, and the properties of Monte Sant'Angelo and San Giovanni Rotondo.  Siege of Kruj√´ (1450) and its aftermath  In June 1450, two years after the Ottomans had captured Svetigrad, they laid siege to Kruj√´ with an army numbering approximately 100,000 men and led again by Sultan Murad II himself and his son, Mehmed II. Following a scorched earth strategy (thus denying the Ottomans the use of necessary local resources), Skanderbeg left a protective garrison of 1,500 men under one of his most trusted lieutenants, Vrana Konti, while, with the remainder of the army, which included many Slavs, Germans, Frenchmen and Italians,: \\"among whom were Slavs, Germans, Italians and others\\"; : \\"including many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans\\" he harassed the Ottoman camps around Kruj√´ by continuously attacking Sultan Murad II's supply caravans. The garrison repelled three major direct assaults on the city walls by the Ottomans, causing great losses to the besieging forces. Ottoman attempts at finding and cutting the water sources failed, as did a sapped tunnel, which collapsed suddenly. An offer of 300,000 aspra (Ottoman silver coins) and a promise of a high rank as an officer in the Ottoman army made to Vrana Konti, were both rejected by him. First Siege of Kruj√´, 1450, woodcut by Jost Amman During the First Siege of Kruj√´, the Venetian merchants from Scutari sold food to the Ottoman army and those of Durazzo supplied Skanderbeg's army. An angry attack by Skanderbeg on the Venetian caravans raised tension between him and the Republic, but the case was resolved with the help of the bailo of Durazzo who stopped the Venetian merchants from any longer furnishing the Ottomans. Venetians' help to the Ottomans notwithstanding, by September 1450, the Ottoman camp was in disarray, as the castle was still not taken, the morale had sunk, and disease was running rampant. Murad II acknowledged that he could not capture the castle of Kruj√´ by force of arms before the winter, and in October 1450, he lifted the siege and made his way to Edirne. The Ottomans suffered 20,000 casualties during the siege, and many more died as Murad escaped Albania. A few months later, on 3 February 1451, Murad died in Edirne and was succeeded by his son Mehmed II (r. 1451‚Äì1481). After the siege Skanderbeg was at the end of his resources. He lost all of his possessions except Kruj√´. The other nobles from the region of Albania allied with Murad II as he came to save them from the oppression. Even after the sultan's withdrawal they rejected Skanderbeg's efforts to enforce his authority over their domains. Skanderbeg then travelled to Ragusa, urging for assistance, and the Ragusans informed Pope Nicholas V. Through financial assistance, Skanderbeg managed to hold Kruj√´ and regain much of his territory. Skanderbeg's success brought praise from all over Europe and ambassadors were sent to him from Rome, Naples, Hungary, and Burgundy.  Ottoman Campaign of Albulena  The local population remained faithful to Skanderbeg and did not reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta ‚Äì as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction ‚Äì and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp.Frash√´ri p. 351. With some of his most trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.Franco p. 320.Hodgkinson p. 148. Albanian assault on the Turkish camp during the battle With the accompaniment of loud noise made from metallic tools and weapons being clapped together, the Albanians charged into the Turkish camp. The Ottomans were caught by surprise and, despite their large numbers, were terrified by the fury of the Albanian assault, thinking they were attacking in larger numbers than they actually had.Frash√´ri p. 352. Hamza tried to reorder his men, assuring them that the Albanians were few. Isak bey, tried to send reinforcements to Hamza's men, but the arrival of new Albanian contingents forced him to turn his attention. A series of cavalry charges and counter-charges kept the battle moving with a rain of missiles and arquebusiers forcing the Ottomans into the heart of the camp. Seeing that they were surrounded, the Ottoman force began to panic and melted away.Hodgkinson p. 149. Hamza was thus captured, though Isak bey fled. The Ottoman dead may have been as high as 30,000, but it is unlikely that they suffered more than 15,000 deaths. In addition, 15,000 men were taken prisoner, twenty-four standards were captured, and all the riches in the camp were lost to the Albanians.Babinger p. 152. A multitude of men were also captured, among them Hamza Kastrioti. The fallen Albanian warriors were buried in the Cathedral of St. Mary in the village of Shumri ( east of Mamurrasi) near the battlefield. The Battle of Albulena was significant for the southern resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Franz Babinger, a historian of the Ottoman Empire, describes the battle as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory. The battle of Albulena strengthened the morale of Skanderbeg's men who afterwards rarely, if at all, deserted his army as Hamza had.Frash√´ri p. 356. Hamza himself was sent as a prisoner to Naples in Alfonso's realm after being captured. An Ottoman envoy was sent to ransom the standard bearers and forty of the distinguished prisoners. The envoy also tried to settle for a truce between Mehmed and Skanderbeg, but the latter responded that he would only accept if Svetigrad and Berat, which had been lost in 1448 and 1450 respectively, were restored to his state.Hodgkinson p. 150. Seeing that Mehmed would not accept such terms, Skanderbeg strengthened his garrisons in the area around Svetigrad.Hodgkinson p. 151. The victory still bought Albania and Italy time; in 1460, Mehmed and Skanderbeg signed an armistice that lasted three years.Sugar p. 67. This gave Skanderbeg the opportunity to land in Italy and help out Alfonso's son, Ferdinand I of Naples, who had been crowned after his father had died.Setton p. 231. The battle thus opened a new phase in the Ottoman-Albanian war which saw the high-water mark of the Albanian resistance and the fiercest Ottoman invasions of Albania in the war. The war would last until the fall of Kruj√´ in 1478.Hodgkinson p. 220.  Death of Skanderbeg In Western Europe the death of Skanderbeg was mourned by princes and other rulers such as Ferdinand I. In a condolence letter written to Skanderbeg's widow dated 24 February 1468, Ferdinand expressed pain of having lost his friend and promised assistance to Skanderbeg's family. During Skanderbeg's lifetime, his assistance to King Alphonse I by sending troops to quell an uprising and later his expedition to suppress a revolt on behalf of King Ferdinand led to Albanian mercenaries and other soldiers being allowed by the Neapolitan monarchs to settle villages in Southern Italy. With the death of Skanderbeg and the conquest of his domains by the Ottomans, Albanian leaders and other Albanians found refuge in the Kingdom of Naples. These events and migrations contributed to the formation of the Arb√´resh community and many of their settlements in southern Italy that still exist in the modern era. The death of Skanderbeg Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá was perceived by Venice as Skanderbeg's successor. After Skanderbeg's death Ivan and his brother Gojko Bal≈°iƒá, together with Leke, Progon and Nicholas Dukagjini, continued to fight for Venice. In 1469 Ivan requested from the Venetian Senate to return him his confiscated property consisting of Castle Petrela, woivodate of \\"Terra nuova\\" of Kruje (unknown position), territory between Kruje and Durr√´s and villages in the region of Bushnesh (today part of the Kod√´r-Thuman√´ municipality). Venice largely conceded to the wishes of Ivan Bal≈°iƒá and installed him as Skanderbeg's successor. After Skanderbeg's death, Venice asked and obtained from his widow the permission to defend Kruj√´ and the other fortresses with Venetian garrisons. Kruj√´ held out during its fourth siege, started in 1477 by Gedik Ahmed Pasha, until 16 June 1478, when the city was starved to death and finally surrendered to Sultan Mehmed II himself. Demoralized and severely weakened by hunger and lack of supplies from the year-long siege, the defenders surrendered to Mehmed, who had promised to allow them to leave unharmed in exchange. As the Albanians were walking away with their families, however, the Ottomans killed the men and enslaved the women and children. In 1479, an Ottoman army, headed again by Mehmed II, besieged and captured Shkod√´r, reducing Venice's Albanian possessions to only Durazzo, Antivari, and Dulcigno. Skanderbeg's son John Castriot II continued the resistance against the Ottomans, and tried to liberate territories from Ottoman rule in 1481‚Äì84. In addition, a major revolt in 1492 occurred in southern Albania, mainly in the Lab√´ria region, and Bayazid II was personally involved with crushing the resistance. In 1501, George Castriot II, grandson of Skanderbeg and son of John Castriot II, along with Progon Dukagjini and around 150‚Äì200 stratioti, went to Lezh√´ and organized a local uprising, but that too was unsuccessful. The Venetians evacuated Durazzo in 1501. After the fall of Albania to the Ottomans the Kingdom of Naples gave land and noble title to Skanderbeg's family, the Castriota. His family were given control over the Duchy of San Pietro in Galatina and the County of Soleto in the Province of Lecce, Italy. His son, John Castriot II, married Jerina Brankoviƒá, daughter of Serbian despot Lazar Brankoviƒá and one of the last descendants of the Palaiologos. Two lines of the Castriota family lived in southern Italy, one of which descended from Pardo Castriota Scanderbeg and the other from Achille Castriota Scanderbeg, who were both biological sons of Ferrante, the son of John Castriot II and his wife Jerina. They were highly ranked Italian nobility and members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.Archivio del Gran Priorato di Napoli e Sicilia del Sovrano Militare Ordine di Malta, Napoli The only legitimate daughter of Duke Ferrante, Irene Castriota Scanderbeg, born to Andreana Acquaviva d'Aragona from the Nard√≤ dukes, inherited the Castriota paternal estate, bringing the Duchy of Galatina and County of Soleto into the Sanseverino family after her marriage with Prince Pietrantonio Sanseverino (1508‚Äì1559). They had a son, Nicol√≤ Bernardino Sanseverino (1541‚Äì1606).  After Skanderbegs death till 1468 The Fourth Siege of Kruj√´ by the Ottoman Empire of Kruj√´ in Albania occurred in 1478, ten years after the death of the Skanderbeg, and resulted in the town's capture after the failure of three prior sieges. Demoralized and severely weakened by hunger and lack of supplies from the year-long siege, the Albanian defenders surrendered to Sultan Mehmed II, who had promised them they could leave unharmed in exchange. One of the important historical sources about this siege is the fourth volume of the Annali Veneti e del Mondo manuscript written by Stefano Magno. =Battle of Shkodra= Strong Ottoman forces besieged Shkodra in spring 1474. Mehmed had dispatched the governor of Rumelia, Hadƒ±m Suleiman Pasha, with about 8,000 men, but they were repulsed by commander Antonio Loredan and feared Venetian reinforcements.Jaques, Tony. Dictionary of Battles and Sieges. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007, p. 921 According to some sources, when Scutari garrison complained for lack of food and water, Loredan told them \\"If you are hungry, here is my flesh; if you are thirsty, I give you my blood.\\" The Venetian Senate ordered all available galleys to transport archers to Shkodra through river Bojana. All Venetian governors were also ordered to help the besieged city. According to Venetian reports in July Shkodra was besieged by 50,000 Ottoman soldiers who were supported by heavy artillery. At the beginning of 1474 the whole region around Shkodra, including the abandoned Baleƒç, came under Ottoman rule. According to some sources the Ottoman sultan had intentions to rebuild Podgorica and Baleƒç in 1474 and to settle them with 5,000 Turkish families in order to establish an additional obstacle for cooperation of Crnojeviƒá's Zeta and besieged Venetian Shkodra. During their 1474 campaign Ottomans damaged Alessio and razed Dagnum castle. Triadan Gritti was appointed as Venetian captain general instead of Pietro Mocenigo. Gritti led the Venetian fleet of six galleys which sailed early in May 1474 to protect the coast of Albania Veneta and especially the mouths of river Bojana. When Venetian fleet entered Bojana the Ottoman forces attempted to block it by clogging the mouth of Bojana with a cut tree trunks, just like Serbian voivode Mazarek did during Second Scutari War. Gritti returned his fleet down the river and destroyed Ottoman forces on 15 June 1474. Despite all of his efforts, Gritti was not able to deliver to Scutari all goods his fleet carried because many of his ships were trapped in the shallow waters of Bojana near Sveti Srƒë. When Gritti joined Mocenigo in Shkodra and they both ordered to Leonardo Boldu to find Ivan Crnojeviƒá and to urge him to mobilize as many of his men as possible to help Venetians during the Siege of Shkodra. Boldu was also ordered to transport Crnojeviƒá's cavalry and infantry over the Skadar Lake. Ivan Crnojeviƒá had important role in the defense of the Shkodra because he provided connection with Kotor and supplied the city through ≈Ωabljak or Skadar Lake, fighting simultaneously against strong Ottoman forces. He transported men and woods from Kotor over the hills into ≈Ωabljak where he built fustas which surprised Ottomans at Skadar lake. During whole summer Ivan Crnojeviƒá participated in military actions. He controlled the Skadar lake with three fustas and 15 smaller ships, which was very important because Venetian fleet (composed of 34 larger ships and about 100 smaller) was unable to sail further than Sveti Srƒë. Boldu was able to reach the besieged city from ≈Ωabljak thanks to the ships of Ivan Crnojeviƒá. The crew of Venetian ships together with stratioti from Greece joined the defenders in the besieged city and, according to some Venetian reports, their total number reached 25,000. After the discovery of the treason committed by Andreas Humoj, a member of Humoj family, during the Siege of Shkodra Gritti sentenced him to death and had him executed by a man from Tuzi. Between 7,000 and 20,000 Ottoman soldiers are reported to have been killed, and approximately 3,000 civilians from Scutari died of thirst and hunger.Merula, George. ‚ÄúThe War of Shkodra‚Äù (1474). An English translation by Robert Elsie at www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html In the siege, the outer walls were damaged significantly. The citizens rebuilt the walls in anticipation of a stronger Ottoman attack later. The Ottomans did return in 1478 to conquer Shkodra.  Forces  Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians. People from the big cities in Albania on the Ottoman-controlled south and Venetian-controlled north did not support him while his followers beside Albanians were also Slavs, Vlachs and Greeks. The rebels did not fight against \\"foreign\\" invaders but against members of their own ethnic groups because the Ottoman forces, both commanders and soldiers, were also composed of local people (Albanians, Slavs, Vlachs and Turkish timar holders). Dorotheos, the Archbishop of Ohrid and clerics and boyars of Ohrid Archbishopric together with considerable number of Christian citizens of Ohrid were expatriated by sultan to Istanbul in 1466 because of their anti-Ottoman activities during Skanderbeg's rebellion. Skanderbeg's rebellion was also supported by Greeks in the Morea. According to Fan Noli, the most reliable counselor of Skanderbeg was Vladan Jurica. = League of Lezh√´ (1444‚Äì1450) = On 2 March 1444 the regional Albanian and Slavic chieftains united against the Ottoman Empire. This alliance (League of Lezh√´) was forged in the Venetian held Lezh√´. A couple of months later Skanderbeg's forces stole cattle of the citizens of Lezh√´ and captured their women and children. The main members of the league were the Arianiti, Bal≈°iƒá, Dukagjini, Muzaka, Spani, Thopia and Crnojeviƒái. All earlier and many modern historians accepted Marin Barleti's news about this meeting in Lezh√´ (without giving it equal weight), although no contemporary Venetian document mentions it. Barleti referred to the meeting as the generalis concilium or universum concilium [general or whole council]; the term \\"League of Lezh√´\\" was coined by subsequent historians.  Aftermath After the death of Skanderbeg in 1468, the organized Albanian resistance against the Ottomans came to an end. Like much of the Balkans, Albania became subject to the invading Turks. Many of its people under the rule of Luca Baffa and Marco Becci fled to the neighboring countries and settled in a few villages in Calabria. From the time of Skanderbeg's death until 1480 there were constant migrations of Albanians to the Italian coast. Throughout the 16th century, these migrations continued and other Albanian villages were formed on Italian soil.The Italo-Albanian villages of southern Italy Issue 25 of Foreign field research program, report, National Research Council (U.S.).

The years and richest migration date back to between 1468 and 1506, when the Venetians, the Albanians, had heard Mehmed II's insatiable languishing after more domination. More and more Albanian cities and fortresses belong to Ottoman rule. The representation was rejected and slaughtered. Many Albanians who foresaw the entire occupation of their homeland and the revenge of the Ottomans, the example of those Albanians who had already settled in southern Italy. From the ports of Ragusa, Skutari and Lezha she heard her home on Venetian, Neapolitan and Albanian ships. The arrival of the Albanians in Italy Pope Paul II wrote to the Duke of Burgundy: ‚ÄúThe cities [of Albania], which were wider up to this day the rage of the Turks, have come under their control from now on. All the peoples who inhabit the shores of the Adriatic Sea tremble at the threat they face. Everywhere you see horror, grief, captivity and death. It is not without tears that you can see the ships that flee from the Albanian leadership themselves in the ports of Italy, those bare miserable families who stretch out their hands to the sky from their own contents of the sea and hear the air with lamentations in an unintelligible language . \\" Many of the Albanians who fled to Italy, those of the local feudal lords in the populated areas and civil rights. You need to feel settled in Genazzano to feel settled in Genazzano. Others in the Marche, a country where they are listed in Urbino and other places in central Italy; of these, all memories are quickly lost. The arrival of the Arb√´resh in Italy with their dads and their cult image; Icon in the Chiesa Santissimo Salvatore in Cosenza There is more to say of those who belonged to the Kingdom of Naples and selected mountainous areas around Benevento (today in Campania) and Barile (1477) and Melfi (today in Basilicata), where they found dilapidated houses, abandoned and devastated places, often also inhabited old abbeys.

After the conquest of Kruja (1478) and Shkodra (1479) by the Ottomans, Albanian nobles fled further to the Kingdom of Naples in order to include the revenge of the Ottomans and Islamization.

Another wave of emigration, between 1500 and 1534, relates to Arb√´resh√´ from central Greece. Employed as mercenaries by Venice, they had to evacuate the colonies of the Peloponnese with the assistance of the troops of Charles V, as the Turks had invaded that region. Charles V established these troops in Italy of the South to reinforce defense against the threat of Turkish invasion. Established in insular villages (which enabled them to maintain their culture until the 20th century), Arb√´resh√´ were, traditionally, soldiers for the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Venice, from the Wars of Religion to the Napoleonic invasion.

Music critic Hagamenon Brito considered him one of the three greatest Brazilian pop rock bassists of all time alongside Paulo Roberto Diniz \\"PJ\\" J√∫nior of Jota Quest and Alexandre Dengue of Na√ß√£o Zumbi, and Emir Ruivo of webzine El Hombre compared him to Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea. Shortly after his death in 2013, caused by a self-inflicted gunshot wound following increasing bouts of anxiety and depression, he was featured in entertainment website Punk Bregas list of the Top 10 Greatest Brazilian Rock Bassists of All Time, in 10th place. Biography Chor√£o and Champignon (on the background) performing in 2012 Luiz Carlos Le√£o Duarte J√∫nior was born in Santos, S√£o Paulo on June 16, 1978; the son of Maria do Carmo Duarte and Luiz Carlos Duarte, he also had two sisters. In his childhood he learned how to play the bass guitar and the drum kit, but came to prefer the former later in life. His musical career began when he was only 12 years old, as the bassist of juvenile band What's Up, through which he met and befriended Chor√£o. It was Chor√£o who nicknamed him \\"Champignon\\", because he thought his hairstyle at the time resembled a mushroom. In 1992, shortly after the end of What's Up, they formed Charlie Brown Jr. alongside guitarists Thiago Castanho and Marc√£o, and drummer Renato Pelado. Amid a series of creative divergences and clashes with Chor√£o, Champignon, Marc√£o and Pelado left Charlie Brown Jr. in 2005 (Castanho was already no longer a member since 2001), after which Chor√£o put the band on hold. Following his departure from Charlie Brown Jr., Champignon formed his own band, Revolucionn√°rios, of which he was the vocalist. Their only studio album, Retratos da Humanidade, came out in 2006 through Champignon's own record label, Champirado Records, awarding him his second Multishow Brazilian Music Award in 2007 in the \\"Best Instrumentalist\\" category ‚Äì he had previously won the award in 2004, while still with Charlie Brown Jr. During his tenure with Revolucionn√°rios, Champignon also won the MTV Video Music Brazil Award, in the \\"Best Bassist\\" category, for three years in a row (2005‚Äì2007). The band broke up in 2008, after which he joined the short-lived Nove Mil Anjos invited by Junior Lima; his other bandmates also included vocalist Per√≠ Carpigiani and guitarist Peu Sousa, a former member of singer Pitty's live band. After releasing a single studio album the same year, Lima put the band on hold in 2009 following a series of creative divergences between the bandmembers. Around the same time he was a guest musician on the only album by his former bandmate Marc√£o's band TH6, Contra Insetos Parasitas. In 2011 Champignon and Chor√£o settled their differences and he returned to Charlie Brown Jr. as bassist. The truce was short-lived though, and after an altercation with Chor√£o during a gig in Apucarana, Paran√° in 2012, he was expelled from the band on stage. One day later though, Chor√£o changed his mind and allowed Champignon to stay. On March 6, 2013, Charlie Brown Jr. effectively ended its activities following the death of Chor√£o due to a cocaine overdose. Champignon's final project was A Banca, a tribute act/\\"spiritual successor\\" to Charlie Brown Jr. comprising former members Bruno Graveto, Thiago Castanho and Marc√£o, as well as new addition Helena \\"Lena\\" Papini. Their only release was the single \\"O Novo Passo\\", which came out in August 2013 and was chosen by Rolling Stone Brasil one of the best Brazilian songs of the year. A Banca was, however, overshadowed by controversy; a parcel of Charlie Brown Jr. fans criticized Champignon for \\"not respecting Chor√£o's death\\" and \\"not mourning it properly\\", going to the point of dismissing him as a \\"cash-grabber\\", a \\"traitor\\" and a \\"Judas\\". Champignon always vehemently denied such claims. In one of his final posts to his social media account he stated that the band's first full-length album was slated for an early 2014 release, following the end of their Chor√£o Eterno Tour in late August, but this never came to be. Towards the end of his life Champignon began to experience bouts of anxiety and sunk into a profound depression, disgruntled by criticism, his insecurities and financial problems caused by his hastiness. On the night of September 8, 2013, after an argument with his wife at a restaurant, he returned home, locked himself in his studio at his apartment and, at 0:30 a.m. of September 9, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .380 ACP pistol. Four months prior, his former Nove Mil Anjos bandmate Peu Sousa had also committed suicide, by hanging; coincidentally, both he and Sousa died aged 35. Champignon was buried at the Cemit√©rio Memorial Necr√≥pole Ecum√™nica at his hometown of Santos, where Chor√£o was also buried six months prior. His wife, fellow musician Claudia Bossle Campos, with whom he had a daughter, Maria Am√©lia, later stated that \\"everything would have been different if he and Chor√£o had truly forgiven each other\\". Two years after his death, she released a song in tribute to him, entitled \\"Bright Light\\", accompanied by a music video; the song was later included in her 2018 extended play Bosslechamp, released on what would have been his 40th birthday on June 16, which also contains songs they wrote together. Both he and his wife were Spiritists. From a previous relationship with Nicole Mecatti the musician had another daughter, Luiza, aged 8 at the time of his death. =Planned film= In 2017, filmmaker Gabriel Mellin announced he was working on a biopic about Champignon, entitled Champ, which focuses on his relationship with Chor√£o. The script was being written by him alongside the musician's widow, Claudia Bossle. Since then, however, no further announcements were made.

She is the Chief Fire Officer of the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service. In 2019 she was selected as one of Marie Claire's Future Shapers and featured on Desert Island Discs.  Early life and education  Cohen-Hatton was born and raised in Marshfield, Newport, South Wales. She attended Bassaleg School. Her mother was of Jewish heritage and her father was born in Israel to Moroccan parents, but the family did not mix with the Jewish community in Wales. At the age of 15, Cohen-Hatton was made homeless after her father died of a brain tumour. Her school was aware that she was not living at home, but did nothing to support her. They also insisted that she wore a wig to cover her dyed hair during her GCSE examinations. During her homelessness, she sold The Big Issue and slept on the streets of Newport, Wales. At the end of her school career, she slept in a derelict building. During the time she spent on the streets, Cohen-Hatton suffered from antisemitic attacks. For around two years, she either slept rough or was vulnerably housed. It took her several attempts to get off the streets and into secure accommodation, including a spending some time sleeping in a van. She joined the fire service in South Wales in 2001 at the age of eighteen. She was the first woman firefighter at that station. Whilst serving as a firefighter, she completed a bachelor's degree in psychology at the Open University, eventually completing a PhD in the behavioural neuroscience lab at Cardiff University. She has since become an ambassador of The Big Issue and has said that it saved her life.  Career  Cohen-Hatton's husband is also a firefighter. In an interview, she recalled a moment where she had responded to a fire and found a horrifically injured firefighter who she thought was her husband. It was not, and she credits that experience to promoting her interest in reducing human error and making firefighters safer. This was also the driver for her to study psychology. Following her PhD, she began to lead research on behalf of the National Fire Chiefs Council (then CFOA). Her research project fitted helmet cameras to incident commanders as they went out on incidents. Her research identified that 80% of the decisions made by firefighters were due to gut instinct, with the other 20% due to an analytical approach. Cohen-Hatton presenting her ideas in Sydney Cohen-Hatton's research resulted in a new decision control process that helps commanders consider goals, consequences and risks that they take under pressure. She found that if firefighters took part in goal-oriented training the number of commanders operating at the most significant level of situation awareness increased up to five times. As part of her research, Cohen-Hatton investigated different training interventions, including virtual reality, firehouse training and live burn. She completed her PhD. Her work helped to shape national fire service policy and informed the National Fire Chiefs Council. She co-supervises a research group at Cardiff University with Rob Honey, supported by the National Fire Chiefs Council, that considers decision making in the emergency service environment. Only 3.1% firefighters in Britain are women, and Cohen-Hatton has worked to inspire girls to become firefighters. She served as Assistant Commissioner seconded to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services and as a Deputy Assistant Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade. Her first book, The Heat of the Moment, was published by Penguin Books in 2019. She was appointed Chief Fire Officer of the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service in 2019. = Awards and honours = *2013 Cardiff University Jury Research Prize *2014 FIRE/GORE Research Excellence prizehttps://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/news/Page-1/honorary-fellowship- for-ground-breaking-incident-command-research/205718 *2016 American Psychological Association Early Career Award from the Society for Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science * 2017 People's Choice Award at the Cardiff University Innovation and Impact Awards * 2018 Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Innovator of the Year award * 2018 American Psychological Association Raymond Nickerson Best Paper Award * 2018 Honorary Fellowship at Cardiff University *2018 Cosmopolitan Millennial Power List * 2019 Marie Claire Future Shaper *2020 The Big Issue Top 100 Changemakers list, Top Campaigner  Personal life  Cohen-Hatton is married to firefighter Mike Hatton and they have a daughter.

Reign Prithviraj ascended the throne of Amber after the death of his father, Raja Chandrasen, in 1503. With his rule Amber, which had been experiencing a long period of stagnation, was revitalised, entering an era of extensive political activity. This may be shown through his marriage to a Mewari princess, to whose house the rajas of Amber owed homage. Prithviraj was a fervent devotee of the Hindu deity Krishna, taking as his spiritual teacher an ascetic who took the name Krishna- das (slave of Krishna). This guru bestowed on the Raja two sacred idols; Narasimha, which has a temple in Amber, and Sitaram, which has a temple in Jaipur. The latter idol was from then on carried at the head of the Amber army in battle. At one point, Prithviraj made a pilgrimage to Dwarka, where he was initiated as a monk in the monastery. In March 1527, he, alongside his son Jagmal and a number of relations, fought under Rana Sanga of Mewar in the fatal Battle of Khanwa against the Mughal emperor Babur. This was the last of the great battles fought by the Rajputs, during which Sanga was debilitated after being struck by an arrow. Prithviraj, alongside Rao Maldev of Marwar and Rao Akheraj of Sirohi, escorted the injured Rana to safety. Prithviraj did not long survive the battle, dying on 19 November 1527, two months before Rana Sanga's death. He was succeeded to the throne by his son Puranmal. Family Prithviraj had nine wives from multiple clans, by whom he had eighteen sons and three daughters. Twelve of these sons reached adulthood, of whom three eventually became rajas of Amber: Puranmal, Bhim Singh and Bharmal. Nine of his sons, alongside three collateral relations, were also awarded estates in perpetuity for them and their descendants. These families are termed the baro kotri (twelve chambers) of the House of Kachwaha, who later formed the highest aristocracy of Jaipur.

Early life  Perry was born December 21, 1884 in Melvin, Illinois, the daughter of Eugene Beauharnais Perry and Elizabeth Wilson Perry. Her father was a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, and a medical doctor; her mother was born in Scotland. Perry trained as a teacher at Illinois State Normal University from 1900 to 1904, and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1909. She earned her master's degree at Illinois in 1910, with a thesis titled \\"The history of the lake shipping trade of Chicago\\". In 1910, she held a fellowship in the Department of Research of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, and from 1911 to 1913, she was a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College. Her fellowship research focused on the millinery trade in Philadelphia and Boston; she earned her doctorate in 1913, under the supervision of Marion Parris Smith and Susan Myra Kingsbury. Her study was later published as Millinery as a Trade for Women (1916).  Career  Lorinda Perry was head of the department of political and social sciences at Rockford College from 1914 to 1916, and taught in the household science department at the University of Illinois from 1916 to 1919. She spoke on women's work during World War I, saying \\"Statistics prove that the war has caused one and a quarter million women to be added to the number previously in industry in England,\\" but that their wages did not match those of the men who held the same jobs before the war. She also organized household science students to make and donate garments to the Red Cross for French war refugees. She helped to establish the Rockford College Club and the University Woman's Club at the University of Illinois. Beyond campus, Perry taught a course in \\"household accounting\\" to the members of the Home Improvement Association of Champaign, and at the YWCA in Decatur. In 1919, Perry taught in Chicago. In 1920 she became a professor of economics at Hunter College in New York. Later in life, she attended law school at the University of Chicago, earned a Juris Doctor degree, and was a member of the Illinois State Bar Association. \\"MIss Perry was interested always in her community, and was courageous, intelligent, and honorable in her handling of the problems she met, never compromising with principle,\\" recalled one obituary in 1951.  Personal life  In 1940, Perry was single and living in Chicago with her single siblings Benjamin, Josephine, Elizabeth, and Eugene. Benjamin and Eugene were medical doctors; Elizabeth was a lawyer, and Josephine served in the Illinois General Assembly. Lorinda Perry died August 30, 1951, aged 66 years, in Chicago; her gravesite was in Gibson City, Illinois.

The temple is now dedicated to a goddess called Harshat Mata, although some art historians theorize that it was originally a Vaishnavite shrine. The original temple appears to have been built in the panchayatana style, which features a main shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only parts of the main shrine now survive and they have been ruined and modified over several centuries, with the tall shikhara tower replaced by a roof-dome. Much of the platform survives, with fragments of carved stones from the original structure, but most of the sculptures have been removed to the museums in Amber and Jaipur. No epigraphic evidence survives regarding the temple's construction, but based on an analysis of its architectural and sculptural styles, historians believe that it was built in the early 9th century, shortly after the construction of the adjoining Chand Baori stepwell. The temple's original builder is unknown, but historians theorize that it may have been built by a Gurjara-Pratihara king, possibly in association with a local Chahamana vassal. The temple is now protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, but remains in religious use.  History  Stone depicting the original appearance of the temple = Date = The original Harshat Mata temple has been ruined and modified over several centuries. No epigraphic evidence been found regarding the construction of the temple or the Chand Baori stepwell connected with it. Based on similarities in style and carvings with the terraced temples of Paranagar and Mandore, the Baodi can be dated to 8th-9th century. The Baodi was likely constructed before the temple, which can be dated to the 9th century based on stylistic grounds. Art historian Michael W Meister of University of Pennsylvania dates the temple complex to c. 800‚Äì825 CE based on architectural details. = Dedication = Based on analysis of sculptures at the temple, art historians such as Meister and R. C. Agrawala (1991) theorize that the temple was originally a Vaishnava shrine. Art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995) theorizes that the temple's iconography is representative of the Pancharatra movement of Vaishnavism. Falk Reitz (1993) of University of Bonn, however, believes that the temple was always a Shakta temple dedicated to a goddess (Devi). Reitz associates several sculptural fragments from Abhaneri - now kept in various museums - with the Harshat Mata temple, and concludes that these fragments show strong Shakta and Shaiva influence. According to Reitz, this is not surprising, since Durga and Parvati (Shiva's wife) are considered different aspects of the same goddess. Reitz states that the Vaishnava sculptures at the temple have a \\"subordinate position\\", and cannot be used to make any conclusions about the temple's sectarian affiliation. According to him, panchayatana temples tend to be syncretic, and it is not surprising to find Vaishnava or Shaiva sculptures at a Shakta temple. According to Reitz, the two fragments of a Durga sculpture discovered in the Chand Baori compound may have belonged to the main idol of the original temple. This sculpture appears to have been a high statue of Durga in her Mahishasura-mardini (killer of the buffalo demon) form. The bigger fragment shows the lower part of Durga's torso with her left leg, her lion vahana, a male attendant, and a beheaded buffalo. The smaller fragment shows six right arms of the multi-armed Durga, with one of the arms pulling an arrow from the quiver; it also features the remains of a halo in the form of a lotus leaf, and two gandharvas (heavenly beings). Reitz points out that the intact sculpture would have been similar to the idol in the Pipala-devi Temple at Osian, which like the Harshat Mata temple, has been dated to 800‚Äì825 CE by Meister. = Builder = The builder of the original temple is unknown. According to Agrawala, the sculptures are representative of the early Gurjara-Pratihara art. Reitz theorizes that the temple may have been constructed under the patronage of a local Chahamana prince (possibly Guvaka I) with support of his Gurjara-Pratihara overlord (possibly Nagabhata II). He notes that Shakambhari ‚Äì the tutelary deity of the Chahamanas ‚Äì has been identified as a form of Durga, and the Bhagavati Barah copper-plate inscription states that Bhagavati (another form of the goddess) was one of the tutelary deities of Nagabhata II. Atherton notes that the lack of adequate historical information prevents attribution of the temple to a particular ruler with certainty, but it is more likely that the Gurjara- Pratiharas ‚Äì not the Chahamanas ‚Äì were the patrons of the temple, with Nagabhata II being the best candidate. = Modern history = In the 20th century, the sanctum had a Durga idol, which was stolen. It was replaced with an idol of goddess Lakshmi, who is now worshipped as Harshat-Mata. The temple remains in religious use; it was inscribed by the Archaeological Survey of India under Act No. LXXI of 1951 dated 28 November 1951.  Architecture  The original temple appears to have been built in the panchayatana style, which features a main shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only parts of the main shrine, and the bottom of an open mandapa with columns survive now, and they have been ruined and modified over several centuries, with roof- domes added. Much of the platform survives, and carved stones from the original structure lie around it, but most of the sculptures have been removed to the museums in Amber, Rajasthan and the Central Museum, Jaipur. The entrance to the temple faces east, towards the rising sun. The temple complex is built on two broad stepped terraces (jagati), which originally included a circumambulatory path, and are now partially ruined. The boundary of the lower terrace has a relatively plain set of foundation and base moldings (vedibandha), which have decorative patterns at the top. The ruins of two small shrines flank the entrance stairway. The upper terrace is far more decorated, but is largely destroyed; the only image that remains intact is of Narasimha flanked by warriors. The four subsidiary shrines may have been located on the upper terrace. Frank Reitz, who believes that the main idol of the temple was always that of Durga, theorizes that the four subsidiary shrines were located to Surya (north-west corner), Ganesha (north-east corner), Karttikeya (south-east corner), and Lakshmi-Narayana or Uma- Maheshvara (south-west). Reitz's theory is based on an analysis of other contemporary and near-contemporary temples, as well as a study of various fragments found at the Chand Baori compound or housed at various museums.

The platform is bounded by a circumambulatory path (sandhara), which was connected to a pillared porch (gudhamandapa). The original path and the porch have been destroyed, and have been rebuilt haphazardly. The platform features figures engaged in amorous activities, which seem to be depictions of encounters between a royal figure and his consorts. According to art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995), these are an idealized portrayal of the temple's royal patron, and are symbolic of Vishnu's reign on earth, thus reinforcing the idea of divine kingship. Several sculptural fragments found at the compound of the adjoining Chand Baori stepwell; the format and dimensions of these fragments suggest that they were once attached to the base moldings on the circumambulatory path. The majority of these fragments feature Shaivite images, including those of Shiva in various forms such as Ardhanarishvara, his wife Parvati, their son Karttikeya, and Shiva's bull Nandi. There is no evidence of any Shaivite shrine having existed in the temple complex. The Harshat Mata temple is now a Devi shrine, and is theorized to have originally been a Vaishnavite shrine; therefore, the iconographic significance of these fragments is not clear.

However, the superstructure has been destroyed, and later rebuilt with a simple dome. The sculptures on the temple walls have largely been lost: the surviving sculptures include those of Vishnu, his vahana - the Garuda, Balarama, apsaras (celestial woman), a vyala (leogryph), Agni, a four-armed Shiva-like seated male, a male seated on a makara (mythical sea creature), a kneeling male having his foot massaged by four female attendants, dancers, and a musician, among others. According to art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton, these images can be explained with reference to the Vishnu worship as described in the Pancharatra texts. These texts characterize various manifestations of the Vishnu successively emanating from his highest form Vasudeva; his brother Samkarshana (Balarama) emanates from Vasudeva; his son Pradyumna emanates from Balarama; and his grandson Aniruddha emanates from Pradyumna. The temple's inner structure has a pancharatha sanctum (garbhagriha): it has an idol of Harshat Mata that was not present in the original temple.

The fall of the inner German border took place shortly afterwards. An end to the Cold War was declared at the Malta Summit three weeks later, and the reunification of Germany took place in October the following year. Background =Opening of the Iron Curtain= The opening of the Iron Curtain between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on August 19, 1989 set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer an East Germany and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. After the picnic, which was based on an idea by Otto von Habsburg to test the reaction of the USSR and Mikhail Gorbachev to an opening of the border, tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans set off for Hungary. Erich Honecker dictated to the Daily Mirror for the Paneuropa Picnic: \\"Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.\\" The leadership of the GDR in East Berlin did not dare to completely block the borders of their own country and the USSR did not respond at all. Thus the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken.Otmar Lahodynsky \\"Eiserner Vorhang: Picknick an der Grenze\\" (Iron curtain: picnic at the border - German), in Profil 13 June 2019.Thomas Roser: DDR-Massenflucht: Ein Picknick hebt die Welt aus den Angeln (German - Mass exodus of the GDR: A picnic clears the world) in: Die Presse 16 August 2018.Andreas R√∂dder, Deutschland einig Vaterland ‚Äì Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009).Mikl√≥s N√©meth in Interview, Austrian TV - ORF \\"Report\\", 25 June 2019.Hilde Szabo: Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu br√∂ckeln (The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland - German), in Wiener Zeitung 16 August 1999; Otmar Lahodynsky: Paneurop√§isches Picknick: Die Generalprobe f√ºr den Mauerfall (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall - German), in: Profil 9 August 2014.Ludwig Greven \\"Und dann ging das Tor auf\\", in Die Zeit, 19 August 2014. Following the summer 1989, by early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia or via the West German embassy in Prague. The emigration was initially tolerated because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. In addition, East Germany was struggling to meet loan payments on foreign borrowings; Egon Krenz sent Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski to unsuccessfully ask West Germany for a short- term loan to make interest payments. =Political changes in East Germany= On 18 October 1989, longtime Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) leader Erich Honecker stepped down in favor of Krenz. Honecker had been seriously ill, and those looking to replace him were initially willing to wait for a \\"biological solution\\", but by October were convinced that the political and economic situation was too grave. Honecker approved the choice, naming Krenz in his resignation speech, and the Volkskammer duly elected him. Although Krenz promised reforms in his first public speech, he was considered by the East German public to be following his predecessor's policies, and public protests demanding his resignation continued. Despite promises of reform, public opposition to the regime continued to grow. On 1 November, Krenz authorized the reopening of the border with Czechoslovakia, which had been sealed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. On 4 November the Alexanderplatz demonstration took place. On 6 November, the Interior Ministry published a draft of new travel regulations, which made cosmetic changes to Honecker-era rules, leaving the approval process opaque and maintaining uncertainty regarding access to foreign currency. The draft enraged ordinary citizens, and was denounced as \\"complete trash\\" by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. Hundreds of refugees crowded onto the steps of the West German embassy in Prague, enraging the Czechoslovaks, who threatened to seal off the East German-Czechoslovak border. On 7 November, Krenz approved the resignation of Prime Minister Willi Stoph and two-thirds of the Politburo; however Krenz was unanimously re-elected as General Secretary by the Central Committee. =New East German immigration policy= On 19 October, Krenz asked Gerhard Lauter to prepare a new travel policy. At a Politburo meeting on 7 November, it was decided to enact a portion of the draft travel regulations addressing permanent emigration immediately. Initially, the Politburo planned to create a special border crossing near Schirnding specifically for this emigration. The Interior and Stasi bureaucrats charged with crafting the new text, however, concluded this was not feasible, and crafted a new text relating to both emigration and temporary travel. It stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips. To ease the difficulties, the Politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day. =VVS b2-937/89= { class=\\"wikitable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Text of the regulation - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 50%;\\"  Original German ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 50%;\\"  English translation - style=\\"vertical- align: top;\\"  Zur Ver√§nderung der Situation der st√§ndigen Ausreise von DDR- B√ºrgern nach der BRD √ºber die CSSR wird festgelegt: 1) Die Verordnung vom 30.

Responsible: Government spokesman of East Germany; Council of Ministers Berlin (ADN) As the Press Office of the Ministry of the Interior has announced, the East German Council of Ministers has decided that the following temporary transition regulation for travel abroad and permanent exit from East Germany will be effective until a corresponding law is put into effect by the Volkskammer: 1) Applications by private individuals for travel abroad can now be made without the previously existing requirements (of demonstrating a need to travel or proving familial relationships). The travel authorizations will be issued within a short period of time. Grounds for denial will only be applied in particularly exceptional cases. 2) The responsible departments of passport and registration control in the People's Police district offices in East Germany are instructed to issue visas for permanent exit without delays and without presentation of the existing requirements for permanent exit.

Riccardo Ehrman is sitting on the floor of the podium with the table just behind him. The announcement of the regulations which brought down the wall took place at an hour-long press conference led by G√ºnter Schabowski, the party leader in East Berlin and the top government spokesman, beginning at 18:00 CET on 9 November and broadcast live on East German television and radio. Schabowski was joined by Minister of Foreign Trade Gerhard Beil and Central Committee members Helga Labs and Manfred Banaschak. Schabowski had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated.Sarotte, Mary Elise (1 November 2009) \\"How it went down: The little accident that toppled history\\" The Washington Post. Retrieved 2 November 2009. Shortly before the press conference, he was handed a note from Krenz announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings‚Äîincluding those between East and West Berlin. At 18:53, near the end of the press conference, ANSA's Riccardo Ehrman asked if the draft travel law of 6 November was a mistake. Schabowski gave a confusing answer that asserted it was necessary because West Germany had exhausted its capacity to accept fleeing East Germans, then remembered the note he had been given and added that a new law had been drafted to allow permanent emigration at any border crossing. This caused a stir in the room; amid several questions at once, Schabowski expressed surprise that the reporters had not yet seen this law, and started reading from the note. After this, a reporter, either Ehrman or Bild-Zeitung reporter Peter Brinkmann, both of whom were sitting in the front row at the press conference,Walker, Marcus (21 October 2009) \\"Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall? Brinkmann Says It Did\\" The Wall Street Journal. asked when the regulations would take effect. After a few seconds' hesitation, Schabowski replied, \\"As far as I know, it takes effect immediately, without delay\\" () This was an apparent assumption based on the note's opening paragraph; as Beil attempted to interject that it was up to the Council of Ministers to decide when it took effect, Schabowski proceeded to read this clause, which stated it was in effect until a law on the matter was passed by the Volkskammer. Crucially, a journalist then asked if the regulation also applied to the crossings to West Berlin. Schabowski shrugged and read item 3 of the note, which confirmed that it did. After this exchange, Daniel Johnson of The Daily Telegraph asked what this law meant for the Berlin Wall. Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the Wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.Walker, Marcus (21 October 2009) \\"Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall? Brinkmann Says It Did\\" The Wall Street Journal. He then ended the press conference promptly at 19:00 as journalists hurried from the room. =NBC interview= After the press conference, Schabowski sat for an interview with NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw in which he repeated that East Germans would be able to emigrate through the border and the regulations would go into effect immediately.Schabowski replied to Brokaw in broken English that East Germans were \\"not further forced to leave GDR by transit through another country,\\" and could now \\"go through the border.\\" When Brokaw asked if this meant \\"freedom of travel,\\" Schabowski replied, \\"Yes of course,\\" and added that it was not \\"a question of tourism,\\" but \\"a permission of leaving GDR.‚Äù; Sarotte, p. 129. =Spreading news= DPA bulletin The news began spreading immediately: the West German Deutsche Presse-Agentur issued a bulletin at 19:04 which reported that East German citizens would be able to cross the inner German border \\"immediately\\". Excerpts from Schabowski's press conference were broadcast on West Germany's two main news programs that night‚Äîat 19:17 on ZDF's heute, which came on the air as the press conference was ending, and as the lead story at 20:00 on ARD's Tagesschau. As ARD and ZDF had broadcast to nearly all of East Germany since the late 1950s, were far more widely viewed than the East German channels, and had become accepted by the East German authorities, this is how most of the population heard the news. Later that night, on ARD's Tagesthemen, anchorman Hanns Joachim Friedrichs proclaimed, \\"This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The gates in the Wall stand open wide.\\" In 2009, Ehrman claimed that a member of the Central Committee had called him and urged him to ask about the travel law during the press conference, but Schabowski called that absurd. Ehrman later recanted this statement in a 2014 interview with an Austrian journalist, admitting that the caller was G√ºnter P√∂tschke, head of the East German news agency ADN, and he only asked if Ehrman would attend the press conference. =Peace prayers at Nikolai Church= St. Nicholas Church in Leipzig has become a famous symbol of the reunification of Germany. Despite the policy of state atheism in East Germany, Christian pastor Christian F√ºhrer regularly met with his congregation at St. Nicholas Church for prayer since 1982. Over the next seven years, the Church grew, despite authorities barricading the streets leading to it, and after church services, peaceful candlelit marches took place. The secret police issued death threats and even attacked some of the marchers, but the crowd still continued to gather. On 9 October 1989, the police and army units were given permission to use force against those assembled, but this did not deter the church service and march from taking place, which gathered 70,000 people. Many of those people started to cross into East Berlin, without a shot being fired. =Crowding of the border= After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the six checkpoints between East and West Berlin, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the \\"more aggressive\\" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany‚Äîin effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through \\"as Schabowski said we can\\". It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Mary Elise Sarotte in a 2009 Washington Post story characterized the series of events leading to the fall of the wall as an accident, saying \\"One of the most momentous events of the past century was, in fact, an accident, a semicomical and bureaucratic mistake that owes as much to the Western media as to the tides of history.\\" =Border openings= Finally, at 10:45 p.m. (alternatively given as 11:30 p.m.) on 9 November, Harald J√§ger, commander of the Bornholmer Stra√üe border crossing, yielded, allowing guards to open the checkpoints and letting people through with little or no identity-checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the Wall and were soon joined by East German youngsters. The evening of 9 November 1989 is known as the night the Wall came down.

An account by Heinz Sch√§fer indicates that he also acted independently and ordered the opening of the gate at Waltersdorf-Rudow a couple of hours earlier. This may explain reports of East Berliners appearing in West Berlin earlier than the opening of the Bornholmer Stra√üe border crossing. =\\"Wallpeckers\\" demolition= A Berlin Wall segment in Los Angeles at 5900 Wilshire Boulevard. 46 second video Removal of the Wall began on the evening of 9 November 1989 and continued over the following days and weeks, with people nicknamed (wallpeckers) using various tools to chip off souvenirs, demolishing lengthy parts in the process, and creating several unofficial border crossings. Television coverage of citizens demolishing sections of the Wall on 9 November was soon followed by the East German regime announcing ten new border crossings, including the historically significant locations of Potsdamer Platz, Glienicker Br√ºcke, and Bernauer Stra√üe. Crowds gathered on both sides of the historic crossings waiting for hours to cheer the bulldozers that tore down portions of the Wall to reconnect the divided roads. While the Wall officially remained guarded at a decreasing intensity, new border crossings continued for some time. Initially the East German Border Troops attempted repairing damage done by the \\"wallpeckers\\"; gradually these attempts ceased, and guards became more lax, tolerating the increasing demolitions and \\"unauthorized\\" border crossing through the holes. =Prime ministers meet= The Brandenburg Gate in the Berlin Wall was opened on 22 December 1989; on that date, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl walked through the gate and was greeted by East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow. West Germans and West Berliners were allowed visa-free travel starting 23 December. Until then, they could only visit East Germany and East Berlin under restrictive conditions that involved application for a visa several days or weeks in advance and obligatory exchange of at least 25 DM per day of their planned stay, all of which hindered spontaneous visits. Thus, in the weeks between 9 November and 23 December, East Germans could actually travel more freely than Westerners. =Official demolition= On 13 June 1990, the East German Border Troops officially began dismantling the Wall, beginning in Bernauer Stra√üe and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Heiligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7 million tonnes of building rubble was produced by the demolition. Unofficially, the demolition of the Bornholmer Stra√üe began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and‚Äîafter 3 October 1990‚Äî600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, of wall, border fence, signal systems and barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenburg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Painted wall segments with artistically valuable motifs were put up for auction in 1990 in Berlin and Monte Carlo. On 1 July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all de jure border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that. The demolition of the Wall was completed in 1992. The fall of the Wall marked the first critical step towards German reunification, which formally concluded a mere 339 days later on 3 October 1990 with the dissolution of East Germany and the official reunification of the German state along the democratic lines of the West German Basic Law.

In September 1989, Margaret Thatcher privately confided to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Fran√ßois Mitterrand warned Thatcher that a unified Germany could make more ground than Adolf Hitler ever had and that Europe would have to bear the consequences. Legacy =Celebrations and anniversaries= On 21 November 1989, Crosby, Stills & Nash performed the song \\"Chippin' Away\\" from Graham Nash's 1986 solo album Innocent Eyes in front of the Brandenburg Gate. On 25 December 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin celebrating the end of the Wall, including Beethoven's 9th symphony (Ode to Joy) with the word \\"Joy\\" () changed to \\"Freedom\\" () in the lyrics sung. The poet Schiller may have originally written \\"Freedom\\" and changed it to \\"Joy\\" out of fear. The orchestra and choir were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. This is the publisher's catalogue entry for a DVD of Bernstein's Christmas 1989 \\"Ode to Freedom\\" concert. On New Year's Eve 1989, David Hasselhoff performed his song \\"Looking for Freedom\\" while standing atop the partly demolished wall. Roger Waters performed the Pink Floyd album The Wall just north of Potsdamer Platz on 21 July 1990, with guests including Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Bryan Adams, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper, Thomas Dolby, Joni Mitchell, Marianne Faithfull, Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Van Morrison. Over the years, there has been a repeated controversial debate as to whether 9 November would make a suitable German national holiday, often initiated by former members of political opposition in East Germany, such as Werner Schulz. Besides being the emotional apogee of East Germany's peaceful revolution, 9 November is also the date of the 1918 abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and declaration of the Weimar Republic, the first German republic. However, 9 November is also the anniversary of the execution of Robert Blum following the 1848 Vienna revolts, the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch and the infamous Kristallnacht pogroms of the Nazis in 1938. Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel criticised the first euphoria, noting that \\"they forgot that 9 November has already entered into history‚Äî51 years earlier it marked the Kristallnacht.\\" As reunification was not official and complete until 3 October (1990), that day was finally chosen as German Unity Day. 10th anniversary celebrations On 9 November 1999, the 10th anniversary was observed with a concert and fireworks at the vid Brandenburg Gate. Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played music by Johann Sebastian Bach, while German rock band Scorpions performed their 1990 song Wind of Change. Wreaths were placed for victims shot down when attempts to escape to west, and politicians delivered speeches. 20th anniversary celebrations On 9 November 2009, Berlin celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall with a \\"Festival of Freedom\\" with dignitaries from around the world in attendance for an evening celebration around the Brandenburg Gate. A high point was when over 1,000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over tall, that were stacked along the former route of the Wall in the city center were toppled in stages, converging in front of the Brandenburg Gate. A Berlin Twitter Wall was set up to allow Twitter users to post messages commemorating the 20th anniversary. The Chinese government quickly shut down access to the Twitter Wall after masses of Chinese users began using it to protest the Great Firewall of China. In the United States, the German Embassy coordinated a public diplomacy campaign with the motto \\"Freedom Without Walls\\", to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The campaign was focused on promoting awareness of the fall of the Berlin Wall among current college students. Students at over 30 universities participated in \\"Freedom Without Walls\\" events in late 2009. First place winner of the Freedom Without Walls Speaking Contest Robert Cannon received a free trip to Berlin for 2010. An international project called Mauerreise (Journey of the Wall) took place in various countries. Twenty symbolic Wall bricks were sent from Berlin starting in May 2009, with the destinations being Korea, Cyprus, Yemen, and other places where everyday life is characterised by division and border experience. In these places, the bricks would become a blank canvas for artists, intellectuals and young people to tackle the \\"wall\\" phenomenon. To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the 3D online virtual world Twinity reconstructed a true-to-scale section of the Wall in virtual Berlin. The MTV Europe Music Awards, on 5 November, had U2 and Tokio Hotel perform songs dedicated to, and about the Berlin Wall. U2 performed at the Brandenburg Gate, and Tokio Hotel performed \\"World Behind My Wall\\". Palestinians in the town of Kalandia, West Bank pulled down parts of the Israeli West Bank barrier, in a demonstration marking the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The International Spy Museum in Washington D.C., hosted a Trabant car rally where 20 Trabants gathered in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Rides were raffled every half-hour and a Trabant crashed through a Berlin Wall mock up. The Trabant was the East German people's car that many used to leave DDR after the collapse. The Allied Museum in the Dahlem district of Berlin hosted a number of events to mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The museum held a Special Exhibition entitled \\"Wall Patrol ‚Äì The Western Powers and the Berlin Wall 1961‚Äì1990\\" which focused on the daily patrols deployed by the Western powers to observe the situation along the Berlin Wall and the fortifications on the GDR border. A sheet of \\"Americans in Berlin\\" Commemorative Cinderella stamps designed by T.H.E. Hill, the author of the novel Voices Under Berlin, was presented to the Museum by David Guerra, Berlin veteran and webmaster of the site www.berlinbrigade.com. The stamps splendidly illustrate that even twenty years on, veterans of service in Berlin still regard their service there as one of the high points of their lives. 30th anniversary celebrations Berlin planned a weeklong arts festival from 4 to 10 November 2019 and a citywide music festival on 9 November to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary. On 4 November, outdoor exhibits opened at Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate, the East Side Gallery, Gethsemane Church, Kurf√ºrstendamm, Schlossplatz, and the former Stasi headquarters in Lichtenberg. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan deliberately chose this date of 9 November 2019 to announce the long-awaited opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, allowing Sikh devotees from India a visa-free border crossing to visit a site especially holy to their religion in Pakistani territory. On 9 November 2019, Hertha Berlin commemorated the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall by tearing a fake Berlin Wall in their match against RB Leipzig.

Odgers (born 1976) is a developmental psychologist who studies adolescent and child development. Her research focuses on how early adversity and exposure to poverty and inequality shapes adolescent mental health and development. Her team team has developed new methodologies and approaches for studying health and development using mobile devices and online tools, with a focus on how digital tools and spaces can be improved to support children and adolescents. Odgers is currently a professor of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine and a Research Professor at Duke University. Odgers is also the Co-Director of the Child & Brain Development Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Odgers has received multiple awards for her research including the 2016 Advanced Research Fellowship from Klaus J. Jacobs Foundation, 2015 Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest Early Career Award from the American Psychological Association, 2014 William T. Grant Scholar Award, 2012 Janet Taylor Spence Award from the Association for Psychological Science, and 2005 Alice Wilson Award from the Royal Society of Canada.  Biography  Odgers attended Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, an athletically themed boarding school, to play basketball, volleyball and run track. She then moved to a nearby city to complete her secondary education and was the first in her family to complete high school. Odgers then went on to play college basketball and attend Simon Fraser University, where she received her undergraduate degree in Criminology and Psychology. In her second year of college, the Simon Fraser Women's Basketball team was involved in a serious accident while traveling a game in the United States. Odgers was injured in the accident and spent a number of years in recovery and rehabilitation. Following her recovery, she obtained a Honors and Masters level degree from Simon Frauser University in 2001 and was awarded with the Terry Fox Medal Terry Fox Medal for overcoming adversity. Odgers was awarded a Commonweath Fellowship to continue her studies at Cambridge University, but was recruited instead by Professor Dick Reppucci to pursue a PhD in psychology at the University of Virginia, which she earned in 2005. Reppucci and Odgers began researching the importance of social settings in child development and conducted a large scale longitudinal study with adolescent females who were sentenced to custody in Virginia. With Marlene Moretti, Odgers also co-lead a multi site study across Canada and the United States focused on the mental health of adolescent girls in juvenile justice settings and mental health settings across the two countries. Odgers completed her postdoctoral training between 2005‚Äì07 in England at the Social, Genetic, & Developmental Psychiatry Centre with Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi, during which time she helped to create a 'genes-to-geography' data archive for 2,232 children from the Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. In 2007, Odgers moved back to the United States and earned a faculty position at the University of California, Irvine and in 2008 she was awarded a William T. Grant Scholars Faculty Award to support her new program of research using mobile devices to capture the daily lives and health of adolescents (the miLife Study) and develop new tools for mapping children's neighborhoods using Google Street View to better understand how the neighborhoods that children grow up in impact health. Odgers began working at the University of California, Irvine in 2007 as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor from 2011‚Äì12. She then worked as Associate Director at the Center for Child and Family Policy of Duke University from 2012‚Äì2016. In 2012, Odgers took the position in the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University. Odgers became a Fellow, for the Association for Psychological Science in 2013, and a Fellow at the Child Brain & Development Program Canadian Institute for Advanced Research in 2016. She is currently working as a psychology professor at the University of California-Irvine and Duke University.  Research  Odgers works at the intersection of developmental psychology, quantitative psychology, and public policy. Her research focuses on how children's early experiences and exposure to adversity influence later mental and physical health. Her team has developed new methodologies and tools for studying adolescents' mental health in daily life. Her most recent findings and research review have been cited widely, including in a feature story in the New York Times disputing claims that adolescents' use of digital technologies is responsible for increasing rates of mental health problems and disorders among adolescents. Odgers has used mobile and other online tools to capture and understand adolescents' mental health and experiences in daily life. A recent study involved over 2100 young adolescents, sampled to be representative of children attending public schools in North Carolina, and for whom a representative subsample (n=400) were followed intensively via mobile devices and wearables. Using these data, she reported in the journal Nature evidence of a ‚Äúnew‚Äù digital divide which she argues threatens to amplify existing inequalities and is likely to pose specific challenges for adolescents already at-risk. Odgers and her team have integrated data, ranging from cellphones to census tract, to test for neighborhood-to-perceptual influences on adolescents‚Äô mental health and, more generally, has leveraged intensively gathered assessments, within individuals, to identify daily triggers of mental health symptoms across early adolescence. In a related line of research, Odgers has collaborated with geneticists, psychiatrists, and statisticians on the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N=2232) to map the long-run influence of childhood adversity, neighborhood contexts, and poly-victimization on adolescent and adult outcomes, including epigenetic markers, inflammation, economic and educational outcomes, loneliness, suicide risk, obesity, and psychosis.

The estate covers 538 of land. It is known for its fortified cherry wine. History =Grimsted= DitlevBrockdorff (1642-1732) The estate was originally called Grimsted and is first mentioned in 1305 but not referred to as a manor until the 16th century. It was by then possibly owned by Niels Vincentsen Lunge, a member of the Privy Council and the owner of nearby Asserstrup. who on his death in 1552 left the estate to his daughter Anne Lunge. Sje married Knud Steensen in1558. After his death in 1575 she resided on the estate for several periods of time. She also outlived their only child and on her death in 1602 Grimsted therefore passed to her 9-year-old grandson, Christoffer Steensen, who in 1635 married Birgitte Mormand, whose family owned Bramsl√∏kke. On Christoffer Steensen's death in 1657, Grimsted passed to his son Hans Steensen. Two years later, he sold the estate to Johan Hieronimus Hoffmann. Hoffmann's widow in 1707 sold Grimsted to Joachim Brockdorff. Joachim Brockdorff died suddenly in 1714 and Grimsted was then taken over by his father, Ditlev Brockdorff, who on his death left it to his grandson Schack Brockdorff. His creditors took over the estate in 1744. This resulted in a prolonged legal dispute over the right to the estate. In 1750, Grimsted was sold in a forced auction to Laurits Pedersen Smith. =Knuth family= Ida Margrethe Reventlow In 1752, Smith sold the estate to Ida Margrethe Knuth, n√©e Reventlow, the widow of the first Count of Knuthenborg. She renamed it Frederiksdal after her second-eldest son, son Christian Frederik Knuth, for whom she had created the Barony of Chhristianss√¶de in 1743. His wasteful lifestyle and poor management of his estates drove the barony into economic ruin and in 1782, against an annual pension, he had to cede it to his son Adam Christopher Knuth. =Later history= Heinrich von Bolten (1734-1790) In 1784 Adam Christopher Knuth also bought Frederiksdal from his father but later that same year sold the estate and nearby Asserstrup to Heinrich von Bolten. Bolten, who was also struggling with economic problems, just two years later had to sell the two estates. The buyers were J.B. Paasche and S.A. Dons. They later shared the estates, leaving Frederiksdal in the hands of Paasche while Asserstrup went to Dons. In 1797, Dons sold Asserstrup and instead purchased Frederiksdal from his former partner. He converted the copyholds to freeholds and sold K√∏belev Church and the farm Stensg√•rd. On his death in 1828, the remains of the estate was sold to Rasmus Martin Clausen. In 1837, he sold Frederiksdal to the German brothers Carl and A. Burchard. After a few years, Carl Burchard bought out his brother. In 1847, he sold it to Anton Martin Julius Nyholm. He owned and managed the estate for more than 40 years. In 1890, Frederiksdal was acquired by Daniel Frederic le Maire. He renovated the buildings and improved the management of the land. His widow, Johanne Beate le Maire, kept Frederiksdal until her death in 1955. Architecture The current main building was built in 1756-1758 to a design by the architect Georg Diderich Tschierscke. The Garden Room contains Rococo-style stucco decorations by the Italian sculptor Carlo Enrico Brenno. Today Frederiksdal is now owned by Harald Krabbe. The estate covers 538 hectares of land. Frederiksdal produces a fortified cherry wine made from Stevnsb√¶r cherries grown on the estate. It is the result of a collaboration between winemaker Morten Brink Iwersen, Frederiksdal-owner Harald Krabbe and chef Jan Friis-Mikkelsen.

Patagonia is a town in Santa Cruz County, Arizona which lies in a narrow valley between the Santa Rita Mountains to the north and the Patagonia Mountains to the south. Patagonia was a mining town and an important supply center for nearby mines and ranches. Brief history The area where Patagonia is located provided the Anasazi, an early Native-American tribe, with plentiful hunting and fishing opportunities. Ruins of the ancient settlements and petroglyphs of the Anasazi have been found by archaeologists. The area was known as a Tohono O'odham rancher√≠a, or seasonal village, called Sonoitac.HistoryTown of PatagoniaWESTERN MINING HISTORYArea History In 1539, Spanish explorer Fray Marcos de Niza entered the area near Lochiel on the Mexican border.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcos-de- Niza He continued on his journey to Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico also known as the Seven Cities of Cibola. Marcos de Niza is credited with being the first European in what is now the State of Arizona.Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \\"Marcos de Niza\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. The main Native American tribes in the area at that time were the Sobaipuri and Papago (Tohono O'odham). In 1692, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino came to the area as a missionary. His main objective was to convert the natives to Catholicism. The area became part of his Mission Los Santos √Ångeles de Guevavi. By 1698, Father Kino encouraged his group to make their way up to Sonoita Creek. When they arrived in Sonoita Creek they encountered groups of indigenous people living along the area in which the creek was located. In the future that area would become known as Patagonia. According to Gilbert Quiroga, president of the Patagonia Museum, Welsh miners that had come from Patagonia in South America came to this region. Patagonia in South America is a region encompassing the vast southernmost tip of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile, with the Andes Mountains as its dividing line. The mountains in the area of Arizona, which the Native Americans called Chihuahuillas, reminded them of those mountains in Patagonia, South America and as such they began calling them the Patagonia Mountains.WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF PATAGONIA'S NAME: MINERS' NOSTALGIA OR GRIZZLY PRINTS? The mission period was ended in 1768 by a decree of Charles III of Spain.Benson History In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence between Mexico and Spain came to an end and the territory of New Spain, which included Arizona, was ceded to Mexico.Mine Tales: Smelter in Benson operated until 1914Desert USABenson Historic Barrio, Cochise County, Arizona By the mid-1850s prospectors were mining the silver- rich mountains east of Sonoita. By the 1860s vast amounts of silver and lead were retrieved from the Patagonia Mountains each year. In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. Americans of European descent from the East Coast of the United States began to arrive in the area. They were protected from the constant attacks of the Apaches by the United States Military. However, The majority of the troops were withdrawn from the area upon the outbreak of the American Civil War. Fort Buchanan, a small garrison established in 1856 near Sonoita, was overrun by the Apaches.Forts Thus, the miners, ranchers and farmers in the region were without protection from the Apaches and many of them moved to other areas. The Civil War between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy) ended in 1865. In 1867, the United States Army established a military post called Camp Crittenden close to Sonoita. The camp, which later was renamed Fort Crittenden, was involved in a campaign against the Apache with the intention of protecting the American pioneers in the area.Arizona Forts of the American West The miners, ranchers and farmers returned to the area once more. Rollin Rice Richardson, a veteran of the Civil War, made a fortune in mining. In 1896, Rollin hired J.C. Green, a surveyor from Tucson, to plot the settlement. As a result, he founded the town that same year and in 1899, he applied to open a post office. Richardson wanted the town to be named \\"Rollin\\" in his honor, however the residents of the area opposed. They petitioned the United States Post Master General to name the town Patagonia after the nearby mountain. Patagonia was recognized as the official name of the town in 1900 by the United States Postal Office Department in Washington, D.C. That same year, a two-story railroad depot was built and Patagonia became the commercial center of the mining district in the Santa Cruz County. The ranching and cattle industry also played an important role in the economy of Patagonia. The arrival of the New Mexico and Arizona Railroad to Patagonia gave the ranchers and miners a new outlet for their products and access to manufactured goods.Patagonia, Jewel of the Sonoita Valley By 1917, Patagonia had running water, an Opera House, three hotels, a schoolhouse, two parks and several stores and saloons. Richardson practically ruled the town until his death in 1923. Patagonia was formally incorporated in 1948.

From the late 20th century onwards, increasing awareness of these attitudes resulted in the reappraisal of both his life achievements and his work by both British historians and the British public, and the reappraisal of his status as one of Britain's most celebrated leaders. Churchill, author of A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, was of the view that British domination ‚Äì in particular through the British Empire ‚Äì was a result of social Darwinism. Like many of his contemporaries he held a hierarchical perspective of race, believing white people were most superior and black people the least. Churchill advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing that British imperialism in its colonies was for the good of the \\"primitive\\" and \\"subject races\\". During an interview in 1902, whilst discussing his views on the Chinese, Churchill stated that the \\"great barbaric nations\\" would \\"menace civilised nations\\", and that \\"The Aryan stock is bound to triumph\\".Gustavus A. Ohlinger (1966). WSC: A Midnight Interview, 1902 Finest Hour 159, Summer 2013 Page 33. International Churchill Society. Retrieved 2020-06-08. He held mixed views of West Asian Muslims, calling Afghans and Iraqis \\"uncivilised tribes\\", and held particular contempt for the Arabic people. However, Churchill was supportive of Ibn Saud, insofar as Saud would support the policy for a Jewish state in Palestine that Churchill had driven personally in the 1920s. Churchill met Saud personally in February 1945 to discuss issues surrounding Palestine, though the meeting was reported by Saudis at the time as being widely unproductive, in great contrast to the meeting Saud had held with American President Franklin D. Roosevelt just days earlier. During World War II, he prioritised the stockpiling of food for Europeans over feeding Indian subjects during the Bengal famine of 1943, against the pleas made by India secretary Leo Amery and the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, but eventually eased the famine by shipment of grains from Australia. Churchill held views on the British populace that were eugenic in perspective, and was a proponent of forced sterilisation to preserve \\"energetic and superior stocks\\". Historian John Charmley has argued that Churchill's denigration of Mahatma Gandhi in the early 1930s contributed to fellow British Conservatives' dismissal of his early warnings about the rise of Adolf Hitler. Churchill's comments on Indians ‚Äì as well as his views on race as a whole ‚Äì were judged by his contemporaries within the Conservative Party to be extreme, at one point having described Indians as \\"a beastly people\\". Churchill's personal doctor, Lord Moran, commented at one point that, in regards to other races, \\"Winston thinks only of the colour of their skin.\\" In 1955, Churchill expressed his support for the slogan \\"Keep England White\\" in regards to immigration from the West Indies. During the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom in June 2020, a statue of Churchill in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words \\"was a racist\\", raising further public discussion of his views.Hockaday, James (2020-06-08). Black Lives Matter protesters spray ‚Äòracist‚Äô on Winston Churchill statue. Metro. Retrieved 2020-06-08. At the same protest, the statue of his rival Mahatma Gandhi, was also sprayed with the word \\"racist\\".  Judaism  Though wary of communist Jews, Churchill strongly supported Zionism and described Jews as \\"the most formidable and the most remarkable race\\", whose \\"first loyalty will always be towards [Jews]\\". Churchill had some sympathy for the \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\" conspiracy theory, and stated in his 1920 article \\"Zionism versus Bolshevism\\" that communism, which he considered a \\"worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality\\", had been established in Russia by Jews: > There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism > and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution, by these > international and for the most part atheistical Jews; it is certainly a very > great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of > Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal > inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. However, according to one of his biographers Andrew Roberts, Churchill rejected antisemitism for virtually all his life. Roberts also describes Churchill as an \\"active Zionist\\" and philosemitic at a time when \\"clubland antisemitism... was a social glue for much of the Respectable Tendency\\". In the same article, Churchill wrote; \\"Some people like the Jews and some do not, but no thoughtful man can doubt the fact that they are beyond all question the most formidable and the most remarkable race that has ever appeared in the world.\\" He further pointed out that the Bolsheviks were \\"repudiated vehemently by the great mass of the Jewish race\\", and concluded: > We owe to the Jews a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely > separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious > possession of mankind, worth in fact the fruits of all wisdom and learning > put together. He also described the Arabs as a \\"lower manifestation\\" than the Jews whom he treated a \\"higher grade race\\" compared to the \\"great hordes of Islam\\".Mark Curtis ‚Äì Secret Affairs: Britain's Collusion with Radical Islam In the lead-up to the Second World War, Churchill expressed disgust at Nazi antisemitism; Clement Attlee recalled that Churchill openly wept when recounting to him the humiliations inflicted upon Jews by the SA during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in April 1933. In August 1932 while in Munich, Churchill was snubbed for a meeting by Adolf Hitler when the two happened to be sharing the same hotel. Churchill expressed to Hitler's confidante Ernst Hanfstaengl, \\"Why is your chief so violent about the Jews?... what is the sense of being against a man simply because of his birth? How can any man help how he is born?\\"  Palestine  In 1937, during the midst of the Arab revolt in Palestine, Churchill spoke at length during Parliamentary debates on the British policy in Palestine. Churchill insisted that the British government not renege on its 1917 promise to create a Jewish national home in Palestine, opposing the idea of granting Palestine self-rule due to the necessary Arab majority that would rule in Britain's place. Churchill held the belief that an eventual Jewish state within Palestine would advance the prosperity of the country, asking rhetorically before the Peel Commission: > Why is there injustice done if people come in and make a livelihood for more > and make the desert into palm groves and orange groves? Churchill's first-hand experience with Arab culture, both as a soldier and an MP, had \\"not impressed him\\", in the words of historian Martin Gilbert; an Arab majority, Churchill maintained, would have resulted in both cultural and material stagnation. Churchill rejected the Arab wish to stop Jewish migration to Palestine: > I do not admit that the dog in the manger has the final right to the manger, > though he may have lain there for a very long time I do not admit that > right. I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the > Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that > a wrong has been to those people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher- > grade race or at any rate a more worldly-wise race, to put it that way, has > come in and taken their place. I do not admit it. I do not think the Red > Indians had any right to say, 'American continent belongs to us and we are > not going to have any of these European settlers coming in here'. They had > not the right, nor had they the power.\\" At the same time, Churchill believed that British policy should not result in what he called \\"harsh injustice\\" to the Arab majority, and that the Arab people would not be displaced by the Jewish influx. He further emphasised the British responsibility to ensure that Palestine's Jews would not discriminate economically against their Arab neighbours, stating that such discrimination would result in the future restriction of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Churchill summarised his views before the Peel Commission bluntly: \\"It is a question of which civilisation you prefer.\\"  India  Churchill often made disparaging comments about Indians, particularly in private conversation. At one point, he explicitly told his Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery, that he \\"hated Indians\\" and considered them \\"a beastly people with a beastly religion\\". During the Bengal famine of 1943, Churchill stated that any potential relief efforts sent to India would accomplish little to nothing, as Indians \\"bred like rabbits\\". His War Cabinet rejected Canadian proposals to send food aid to India, asking the US and Australia to send aid in their stead; according to historian Arthur Herman, Churchill's overarching concern was the ongoing Second World War, leading to his decisions to divert food supplies from India to Allied military campaigns. However, Churchill exported the excess grain to Europe instead of to the British troops on the front line, adding to the buffer stocks being created against the possibility of future second front invasions in both Greece and Yugoslavia. Leo Amery, Secretary of State for India and Burma and a contemporary of Churchill, likened his understanding of India's problems to King George III's apathy for the Americas. In his private diaries, Amery wrote \\"on the subject of India, Winston is not quite sane\\" and that he did not \\"see much difference between [Churchill's] outlook and Hitler's\\".  China  Churchill called China a \\"barbaric nation\\" and advocated for the \\"partition of China\\". He wrote: > I think we shall have to take the Chinese in hand and regulate them. I > believe that as civilized nations become more powerful they will get more > ruthless, and the time will come when the world will impatiently bear the > existence of great barbaric nations who may at any time arm themselves and > menace civilized nations. I believe in the ultimate partition of China ‚Äì I > mean ultimate. I hope we shall not have to do it in our day. The Aryan stock > is bound to triumph. In May 1954, Violet Bonham-Carter asked Churchill's opinion about a Labour party visit to China. Winston Churchill replied: > I hate people with slit eyes and pigtails. I don't like the look of them or > the smell of them ‚Äì but I suppose it does no great harm to have a look at > them.Churchill: The Unexpected Hero, p. 233, Addison, Paul  Chemical weapons in Iraq  After 1920 Iraqi revolt against the British, Churchill advocated the use of tear gas against \\"uncivilized tribes\\" instead of bombing as it would disperse rebels without loss of life or having to resort to lethal force: > I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have > definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour > of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer > affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting > shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory [tear] > gas. I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised > tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be > reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly > gasses: gases can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a > lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of > those affected. Churchill also defended the use of chemical weapons against Germans in World War I.

It lies between the basins of the Washicoutai River to the west and the Coacoachou River to the east. It includes part of the unorganized territory of Petit-M√©catina, Quebec and part of the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent. The proposed River Natashquan Biodiversity Reserve would be partially within the watershed. The river is more than long, flowing to the west of the √âtamamiou River. It rises in a swampy area, first flows northwest, then makes an abrupt turn and flows south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The mouth of the Olomane River is in the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent in Le Golfe-du-Saint- Laurent Regional County Municipality. The Innu settlement of La Romaine is on the west shore of the bay at the mouth of the river. Description According to the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914), Name Eug√®ne Rouillard (1906) says the Innu language word Olomanoshibo means \\"Paint River\\" and refers to the reddish color of the water. Red ocher deposits are found on the banks of the river. The river is named Ouraman in the 1685 map by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin. Variants of the name since the 18th century include Eau ramane (Jacques-Nicolas Bellin 1744), Oraman, Ouramane, Oraman, Olomanosheebo and Olomanasheebou. The Olomane form was adopted in 1921. In the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1925) the river was named Grande Romaine to distinguish it from the Romaine River that enters the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the west at Havre- Saint-Pierre. Settlement The Innu people have traditionally left their winter hunting grounds and lived at the mouth of the river in summer. A trading post operated at the mouth of the river from 1710 to 1925. A report dated 11 May 2009 said that the community of La Romaine did not support a project to connect the settlement to the main network from Natashquan, and a partnership for a 6.6 MW hydroelectric plant on the Olomane River, located near the village, was being explored. The existing 4 MW diesel plant was expected to no longer be sufficient by 2015.

This concept was developed based on Harden Jones' triangle of migration. This refers to the idea that fish migrate from their spawning grounds to their nursery ground. Then from the nursery grounds, they join the adult population of fish at the feeding ground. Finally, the fish returns to the spawning grounds to spawn. The process of hydrographic containment typically works in this way: Fish migrate from their feeding grounds to their spawning grounds using selective tidal transport or a current/counter-current system to move against a stream of water. The fish population then releases their larvae into the same current and the larvae drift to their nursery grounds in shallower waters while the spent adults are carried back in the stream they arrived in. After a certain period of time, the juvenile fish migrate from the nursery grounds to the feeding grounds. These two migrations, the mature adults back to the spawning grounds and the immature fish from the nursery grounds to the feeding grounds, make up the identity of the fish stock. Different stocks of fish carry out this migration pattern differently to minimize the loss of larvae and juveniles to waters unsuitable for survival and make sure that the juveniles arrive at an optimal nursery habitat. This process has been well documented in plaice of the North Sea. The North Sea plaice gather over a modest region in the southwest corner of the North Sea to spawn, some fish traveling vast distances to arrive at this location. The almost certain reason the plaice choose this region for spawning is because the drift of the larvae from the English Channel will bring them from their spawning grounds in the southwest corner to the entry of the Dutch Wadden Sea, an optimal juvenile rearing habitat, right as the plaice reach their juvenile life phase.

Belgrave became a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in 1997. Some of the courses that she taught include graduate level Social Psychology, Program Evaluation, and undergraduate level African American Psychology. Belgrave worked with many collaborators for her research (e.g., community partners or funding agencies) including local school systems, churches and faith based institutions, community based youth servicing agencies, local health clinics, and Black Colleges and Universities among others. Some of the funding agencies that supported Belgrave's research include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, National Cancer Institute, Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health to Virginia Commonwealth University, and Virginia Tobacco Settlement Foundation.  Research  Belgrave's research focuses in the areas of drug and HIV prevention among African Americans and other ethnic minorities, specifically the youth and young adults. She conducts research at the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Cultural Experiences in Prevention. She is currently the primary investigator for the project: \\"Building Capacity for Substance Abuse and HIV Prevention among African American Young Adults\\" which began in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2020.

In particular, Belgrave and her party strive to reduce HIV and substance abuse in the African American community. Raise 5 uses five major strategies to achieve this goal and is funded for five years by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Office on Women's Health. It is a collaborative effort with community partners Fan Free Clinic and the VCU Wellness Resource Center. The project, SISTA, focused on teaching heterosexual African American women the importance of having protected sex, and how decision making can be effected after consuming substances. There was an evaluation done of this curriculum to study the effectiveness of the enhanced curriculum compared to the standard SISTA curriculum that Belgrave had been using. The enhanced SISTA intervention demonstrated greater effectiveness than did the standard SISTA intervention in promoting HIV knowledge at post-test and subsequent condom use at the 3-month follow-up .

It has been dammed to supply a hydroelectric power plant. The shoreline around the mouth of the river is protected as part of a federal bird sanctuary. Location The V√©co River is long and its watershed covers . The river drains Lake Robertson Lake, Lake Charles and Lake Blais. It empties into Ha! Ha! Bay. The river flows through the unorganized territory of Petit-M√©catina. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Gros-M√©catina in Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality. Name The river is named after Jean-Baptiste V√©co, a notary- royal, who exercised his profession in Acadia in the 17th century. Dam A Hydro-Qu√©bec dam on the river created the Robertson Reservoir for the Lac- Robertson Generating Station, which includes the former Lake Robertson and Lake Plamondon. It contains rainbow smelt, arctic char, brook trout and landlocked salmon. The 22 MW power plant came into operation in 1995. The water quality was monitored from 1990 to 1997. The dam had the effect of increasing mercury content in the lake water. Degradation of organic matter in the flooded zone releases mercury, which is transformed into methyl mercury and enters the food chain. These changes may have affected the water quality of the V√©co River and Ha! Ha! Bay. Conservation The proposed Harrington Harbor Biodiversity Reserve would lie in the river's watershed. A bird sanctuary, the Gros-M√©catina Migratory Bird Sanctuary, covers Plate Island and Trois Collines Island as well as Marmette Islands and Rocks. It is fully protected and access is forbidden. It is owned by the Federal Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife and is subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Canada Wildlife Act and the Regulations on migratory bird sanctuaries. The tidal zone of the Gros M√©catina River and the V√©co River are outside the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Gros-M√©catina and are managed by the bird sanctuary. Fishing The V√©co River is used as a spawning ground by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) has been noted in Robertson Lake, and could be more widespread in the area. The mouth of the V√©co River in Ha!Ha! Bay is home to rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). The Pourvoirie Kecarpoui arranges fishing/camping expeditions that include the V√©co River and other nearby rivers (K√©carpoui, Saint-Augustin, Coxipi, Ch√©catica and Napetipi. In the period from 2012 to 2016 an average of four salmon were reported caught in the river each year. In 2017 all salmon, large and small, had to be released on the Malbaie (Gasp√© Peninsula), Pigou, Bouleau, Magpie, Coacoachou, N√©tagamiou, Little Mecatina and V√©co rivers. Only young salmon could be retained on 51 rivers, and limited retention of large salmon was allowed on 19 rivers.

For economic and political reasons, fuel is scarce and private automobile ownership is nearly unheard of, so ordinary citizens must rely on human-powered vehicles and public transport. A ban on bicycles in the country's capitol & largest city, Pyongyang, in existence for decades, was suddenly lifted in 1992, and according to Andrei Lankov, bicycles have since \\"proliferated\\" and their use has \\"visibly increased\\" in other urban areas. However, their price, meager by international standards, still puts them out of reach of a significant portion of the populace. A modest infrastructure, including bicycle lanes and bicycle parking, has likewise developed. Foreign and domestic bicycles are available, with used Japanese models particularly coveted. The most favored domestic model, the Kalmaegi (Í∞àÎß§Í∏∞, \\"Seagull\\"), produced with prison labor at a concentration camp in Chongjin, cost \\"almost ten times the average annual salary\\" in the 1990s. Electric bicycles are also popular. Cyclists must reportedly obtain a license by passing a road safety test, and must register bicycles and display a corresponding tag as proof, though the law is often flouted outside the capitol. Conflicting reports exist that women are, or have been, banned from riding bicycles, with some claiming the ban to be a personal edict of Kim Jong-il; however, female cyclists are a common sight in North Korea's large cities, indicating this law, too, if it still exists, is widely ignored. Ryomyong bicycle-sharing A station of Pyongyang's bicycle-sharing system In 2017, Tongil News reported the introduction of a bicycle-sharing system in Pyongyang, called Ryomyong (Î†§Î™Ö \\"Dawn\\"), sharing photographs from the Russian embassy.

The full name of the organization is the Sher Vancouver LGBTQ Friends Society. The society was originally founded as an online Yahoo group for LGBTQ Sikhs in April 2008 by social worker Alex Sangha of Delta, B.C.  About the Name and Logo  Sher means ‚Äúlion‚Äù in Persian and many South Asian languages. Sher was chosen as the name because it symbolizes courage, pride, bravery, and strength. In addition, the Sikh name ‚ÄúSingh‚Äù for males also means lion and the Sikh name ‚ÄúKaur‚Äù for females means lioness or princess. The original Sher Vancouver logo which was in use from 2008 to 2018 consisted of a pink circular Lionhead on a white background, and Sher was in bold pink letters and Vancouver in grey. It was created by local Vancouver graphic designer and illustrator, Jag Nagra. In April 2018, as Sher Vancouver celebrated its 10th anniversary, Jag Nagra did a full re-brand of Sher Vancouver‚Äôs visual identity using a vibrant 2-colour logo paired with an updated icon.  Activities  Sher Vancouver launched the Dosti project which means friendship in many South Asian languages. The project was an anti-bullying, racism, homophobia, transphobia and coming out workshop that went into high schools. The project was launched around a time when there was increased anxiety and racial tension in Vancouver regarding gay bashings by South Asians in the city. Sher Vancouver also provides free crisis counselling and offers peer support groups. In April 2018, Sher Vancouver marked its 10th anniversary by hosting the Desi-Q Cultural Celebration in Surrey, B.C. In April 2020, Sher Vancouver launched a comprehensive legal resource, prepared by Pro Bono Students Canada - UBC Chapter, that provided information on LGBTQ+ friendly lawyer referrals, human rights and discrimination, and safe countries for LGBTQ+ travellers  Vancouver Pride Parade  In 2016, Sher Vancouver Founder Alex Sangha became the first Sikh to become the Grand Marshal of the Vancouver Pride Parade. In 2017, the Canadian federal defence minister Harjit Sajjan, who himself is a Sikh and wears a turban, danced on the Sher float in the Vancouver Pride Parade. This sent a message to the Sikh community that LGBTQ people need to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality.  Vancouver Vaisakhi Parade  In 2017, Sher Vancouver became the first LGBTQ South Asian organization to participate in the Vancouver Vaisakhi Parade. Sher Vancouver has since participated in the Vancouver Vaisakhi Parade multiple times.  Out and Proud Project  In 2013, Sher Vancouver launched the Out and Proud Project which profiled LGBTQ South Asians from around the world.  January Marie Lapuz  January Marie Lapuz (born John Carlo Embo Lapuz; April 9, 1986 ‚Äì September 30, 2012) was the social coordinator of Sher Vancouver and was the first transgender person to become an Executive member of the organization . She died of multiple stab wounds in New Westminster, BC due to an altercation with a client over the price of a sexual encounter. Sher Vancouver wrote to the City of New Westminster advocating for a memorial for January Marie Lapuz.  Youth Leadership Award  In 2015, Sher Vancouver launched the January Marie Lapuz Youth Leadership Award to recognize youth who are 16 to 30 who demonstrate involvement, commitment, and leadership in the LGBTQ community. Social activist Jaspreet Chahal of Surrey, BC was the inaugural winner in 2015 and South Asian LGBTQ magazine Founder Sukhdeep Singh of India was the winner in 2016. Social activists Prachi Khanna was the winner in 2017, and Shilpa Narayan in 2018, both of Surrey, BC.. Transgender Lebanese journalist and activist Norma Lize of Vancouver was the winner in 2019.  Documentaries  In 2018, Sher Vancouver released a short documentary film, My Name Was January, which was a tribute and eulogy for January and provided a platform for other trans women of colour to express their issues, challenges, and strengths. The film was an official selection at the National Screen Institute Online Short Film Festival in Winnipeg, Manitoba and the San Francisco Bay Area Sex Worker Film and Arts Festival. The documentary has won 13 international awards, and garnered 56 official selections at film festivals around the world. The film was produced by Sher Vancouver Founder Alex Sangha and Sher Vancouver President Ash Brar and directed by former Kwantlen Polytechnic University Journalism students Elina Gress and Lenee Son. My Name Was January stars January‚Äôs mother Betty Lapuz, and her friends Ash Brar, Alex Sangha, Josh Soronow, Pam Hayer and Velvet Steele, as well as social activists Kelendria Nation and Natasha Adsit. There is rare footage of January Marie Lapuz herself. In 2019, Sher Vancouver announced it is working on a second documentary entitled ‚ÄúEmergence ‚Äì Out of the Shadows‚Äù about the strengths and struggles of gay and lesbian South Asian people and the reactions of their parents. The film is produced by Alex Sangha and directed by Vinay Giridhar, and stars Alex Sangha, Jaspal Kaur Sangha, Kayden Bhangu, Jag Nagra, Avtar Singh Nagra, and Rajwant Kaur Nagra.  Awards  Sher Vancouver received an award from New West Pride for being ‚ÄúOrganization of the Year‚Äù for establishing the January Marie Lapuz Youth Leadership Award.

The 1953 work comprises many 'cloud' panels that are renowned both artistically and acoustically. The piece is seen as \\"one of Calder's most truly monumental works\\" and the prime example of the urban-artistic theory of campus architect Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva. Originally intended as only an art piece, the panels were moved inside the Aula Magna to resolve the poor acoustics caused by the hall's design; the hall has since been said to have some of the best acoustics in the world. The Floating Clouds are named specifically in the UNESCO listing of the campus as a World Heritage Site, and are greatly renowned in Venezuela.  Background  The Venezuelan architect and designer Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva began designing the University City of Caracas campus in the 1940s, beginning construction in the 1950s. In a time of prevailing Modernism in Latin America, Villanueva had a stylistic ideology for the project he called the \\"Synthesis of the Arts\\"; combining the arts and architecture and creating artistic pieces that could also serve functional purposes. These principles also facilitated for the campus designs to change dramatically, both through necessity and the whim of the designer and artists he hired. Villanueva hired many artists from around the world to contribute works to the campus, including the American sculptor Alexander Calder. Calder contributed four pieces; the Floating Clouds, two stabiles, and a mobile known as R√°faga de nieve.  Design and construction  The design of the Floating Clouds was originally a large mobile structure for outside the Aula Magna, either in its atrium or in the Plaza Cubierta, a connected covered outdoor space, but the artwork was moved inside for two diverse reasons. During the design of the hall, Calder learnt how complex both Villanueva's project and his Synthesis of the Arts theory were, and proposed an integration of his panels into the space to serve \\"an artistic, decorative and acoustic purpose\\". On the construction side, at the same time, the Bolt, Beranek and Newman company (who were involved for logistics and construction) made Villanueva aware of a specialist flaw in his designs for the Aula Magna; based on a conch shape, the natural acoustics would be poor and extensive panelling inside was needed. Calder's panel design would serve the acoustic function, and was modified for the interior by Robert Newman. The panels of the design, known as 'clouds', are made of two laminated wood pieces each thick, held in a steel frame; they vary in thickness from and are held to the ceiling and walls by metal cables, which were adjustable at the time of installation to give the inclination and height needed. A false ceiling was created to help with the installation of the clouds and additional lighting around them. The Bolt, Beranek and Newman company installed the clouds; to calibrate the design perfectly, an orchestra played on stage while they were being fitted. The artwork comprises 31 clouds, with 22 on the ceiling, five on the right side wall and four on the left side wall. The largest of these has a surface area of and a weight of approximately . Ladders exist in the ceiling space, allowing people to climb through the clouds.  Appearance and function  The design of the clouds and their response to a problem with sound was a contributor to the development of interior space acoustics. The panels are positioned with consideration to angle and dimensions; some absorb sound, some project it, and some magnify it. As Calder intended, the clouds combine technology and art; however, Calder had also wanted the clouds to be movable, so that they could create different acoustic experiences, but they are not ‚Äì after being angled for installation they are fixed. The hall can have two different acoustic optimization formats, though, as a removable fiberglass sheet was installed above the panels. This is intended to reduce echo and sound transfer time, which optimizes the acoustics for speech; removing the sheet with the clouds in place gives the outstanding acoustics for musical performance. Art critic Phyllis Tuchman notes that though Calder was not Latin American, the \\"colorfully curving\\" clouds are \\"archetypically 'Latin American'\\"; she says that this \\"express[es] the region's 'lyricism'\\". Tuchman also appreciates the real cloud-like appearance, saying that the interior of the hall \\"resembles clouds scattered across a night sky [...] [w]ith the hall darkened\\", so those who enter with only the houselights on \\"feel as if they have entered a multihued, three-dimensional abstract painting\\". Patrick Frank, writer on modern art in Latin America, says that the design \\"both dazzles the senses and inspires awareness\\". Supposedly, when the Aula Magna was completed and the clouds had just been painted, Villanueva went inside to see them and was so impressed he threw his arms up and cheered.  Legacy  Villanueva centenary logo After working on the campus project, Villanueva and Calder began a longstanding working relationship. However, Calder only saw his Floating Clouds in person once, when visiting Villanueva in Caracas in 1955. The clouds are seen as the best example of Villanueva's philosophy of the campus project, in that they combine art, architecture, design, and function. Calder is noted as naming the clouds as his favorite of his own works, while acknowledging they are less remembered than many other pieces. The Aula Magna was ranked by acoustics engineer Leo Beranek in the 1980s as one of the top five concert halls worldwide in terms of acoustics, largely because of the clouds. The interior design and function has also influenced other venues seeking impressive acoustics, including an opera hall in China. In UNESCO's World Heritage listing of the campus, the Clouds are named specifically. A stylized image of the interior of the Aula Magna, framed as a silhouette within a shape of one of the clouds, is used as the logo for the centenary celebration of Villanueva.

History The Enterprise was launched in 1958 by Barry O'Connor and Orville Danforth, former reporters for the Marysville Globe under Simeon R. Wilson III. The first edition of the newspaper was published on September 12, 1958, serving Edmonds and Lynnwood. A Mountlake Terrace edition was added in late 1958, followed by editions for northern King County communities in the 1970s that were later cancelled. In 1960, The Enterprise was sold to the Lafromboise family, who also operated The Chronicle in Centralia. The Lafromboises also purchased the Edmonds Tribune- Review, which had been founded in 1910. The newspaper added a new edition to serve Mill Creek in the 1980s. It was sold again to The Everett Herald in 1996, where it absorbed Shoreline Week to produce a new edition. The four editions were consolidated into a single edition in 2009 and renamed to The Weekly Herald two years later.

Born in Christchurch, Hill attended St Margaret's School and then earned her BSc from Canterbury University College in 1931, and MSc in 1932. Her Masters thesis was on the morphology and life history of Archichauliodes diversus, commonly called the New Zealand dobsonfly. Appointed to the Entomology Section of the Plant Research Bureau of DSIR, Hill worked in Palmerston North until 1937, when she moved to the Cawthron Institute in Nelson. Whilst there, Hill presented her work on the insects affecting cocksfoot crops, including the cocksfoot stem-borer, the midge, and others to the Royal Society of New Zealand in Wellington. In the 1950s, Hill inherited family property on Memorial Avenue in Christchurch. After a visit to Sissinghurst Castle in England with her husband Frank, Hill decided to establish a herb nursery. She soon became a local authority on herb growing, and planted 150 varieties of herb and flowering plants. Hill donated her property to what is now the Christchurch City Council, as the Avice Hill Community Reserve and Arts and Crafts Centre. With Peggy Fitts and one other person, Hill formed the Canterbury Herb Society in 1968, who still maintain the collection at 395 Memorial Avenue.

He was created a baronet \\"of East Stoke in the County of Nottingham\\", a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain, on 31 October 1757. Origins He was the eldest son of Abel Smith I (1686‚Äì1756) of Nottingham, the 2nd son of Thomas Smith I (1631‚Äì1699), the founder of Smith's Bank in Nottingham. His younger brothers included: Abel Smith II (1717‚Äì1788) (father of Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington and of John Smith (1767‚Äì1842) of Blendon Hall, MP, great-grandfather of Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester (1867‚Äì1956)) and John Smith (born 1716), ancestor of Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote (1828-1902). His mother was Jane Beaumont (1689-1743), a daughter of George Beaumont of Chapelthorpe in Yorkshire. Marriages & issue He married twice: *Firstly to Mary Howe (1726-1761), daughter and sole heiress of Major William Howe (1699-1733) by his wife Elizabeth Pauncefote, one of the two daughters and co-heiresses of William Pauncefote (d.1711) of Carswalls'Newent - Manors and Estates', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 12, ed.

Jurica (Woodbridge, 2010), pp. 301-317 near Dymock, both in Gloucestershire. Elizabeth's sister and co-heiress Sarah Pauncefote was the wife of William Bromley (d.1769) of Abberley Hall near Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire. His father-in-law Major William Howe was the son of Lieutenant-General Emanuel Scrope Howe (c.1663-1709) (the fourth son of John Grubham Howe (1625‚Äì1679) of Langar Hall in Nottinghamshire, the younger son of Sir John Howe, 1st Baronet) by his wife Ruperta, the illegitimate daughter of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, grandson of King James I. By his first wife he had issue, of whom only one survived:Per his monument in St. Oswald's parish church, East Stoke Sir George Pauncefote-Bromley, 2nd Baronet (1753‚Äì1808), 1780 miniature by John Smart **Sir George Pauncefote-Bromley, 2nd Baronet (1753‚Äì1808), High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1775. In 1778 he assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Bromley in lieu of his patronymic and in 1803 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Pauncefote in addition to that of Bromley, having inherited or purchased the outstanding moities of his maternal estates of Carswalls and Preston from his mother's childless first- cousin Robert Bromley (d.1803) of Abberley. Robert Bromley (d.1803) thus disposed of his maternal estates to the descendant of his mother's sister, but his paternal estate of Abberley he bequeathed to his illegitimate kinsman Col. Henry Bromley (c.1803-1836), a Member of Parliament for Worcester 1806-7, illegitimate son of a certain William Bromley. In 1778 he married Esther Curzon, who brought with her a large dowry, a daughter of Assheton Curzon, 1st Viscount Curzon (1730-1820) of Hagley Hall in Staffordshire. However by 1782 it had become clear to his wife that he was homosexual: Lady Bromley observed an increasing impertinent familiar behaviour of Sr George Bromley to his male servants, but inspecting (suspecting) as she was of the cause, it past on for some time until his conduct discovered evident proof to her of a strong propensity to the vice of sodomitical practices he separated himself from her bed grew less attentive and soon almost entirely alienated his affections, if he ever entertained any, for her, and directed all his thoughts and actions to his favourite male servants spending the whole of his time with them in his study or in amusements under the pretences of fishing and having one constantly to sleep in the same room with him.Tim White Following the complaint of one of his male servants, he was tried at Nottingham Assizes in 1791 and was convicted for assault and attempted sodomy and was jailed for 2 years, and was divorced by his wife. By his wife he had a son and heir: ***Admiral Sir Robert Howe Bromley, 3rd Baronet (1778‚Äì1857) *Secondly in 1768 he married Catherine Vyse (died 1786), a daughter of William Vyse of Lichfield, Archdeacon of Salop.B.

Jones is a researcher on women's substance abuse disorders and its impact on children. She is a Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Adjunct Professor in the University of North Carolina College of Arts & Sciences Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. Jones is the Executive Director of the UNC Horizons Program, which is a comprehensive drug treatment program for mothers and their drug-exposed children. She is a consultant for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization. Jones was awarded the 2019 Marian W. Fischman Lectureship Award, in honor of the late Marian W. Fischman, a pioneer in drug abuse research. She received the 2015 Award of Excellence in International Collaborative Research (with Gabriele Fischer) from the NIDA International Program for their multi-site clinical trial of \\"Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research\\" (MOTHER project) which suggests that buprenorphine is a safe and effective treatment for opioid dependence during pregnancy when compared to methadone. In 2012, she received Betty Ford Award from Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse, because of her contribution to the advancement of women‚Äôs addiction treatment. She was also awarded the 2005 Early Distinguished Scientific Awards for Early Career Contributions to Psychology by the American Psychological Association. Jones' research has been funded by the United States National Institutes of Health.  Biography  Jones was born in Richmond, Virginia. She received a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University and a Doctorate in Psychology from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She is married to Erik Lensch, with whom has two children. They moved to North Carolina in 2006. In 2010, Jones served as the President of the American Psychological Association Division of Psychopharmacology and Substance Abuse (Division 28). In an interview, Jones explained that she became interested in being a researcher after volunteering in a special needs classroom that her mother taught. During the volunteer experience, she saw children who had disabilities because of violence and toxins, and wanted to understand how to help mothers have healthier pregnancies and help children reach their full potential. Jones co-authored Treating Women with Substance Use Disorders During Pregnancy: A Comprehensive Approach to Caring for Mother and Child Mention (2013) with Karol Kaltenbach and provided an overview of treatments for pregnant women with substance use disorders. Jones co-authored Reinforcement-Based Treatment for Substance Use Disorders: A Comprehensive Behavioral Approach (2012) with L. Michelle Tuten, Cindy Schaeffer, and Maxine L. Stitzer, which serves as a manual for implementing Reinforcement-Based Treatment to treat substance use disorders in community settings.  Research  Jones' research focuses on the development and examination of behavioral and pharmacological treatments for pregnant women and children in risky life situations, including substance use disorders. One of the projects on which she worked investigated drug-use of women in the Republic of Georgia, by examining their psycho-social characteristics, drug use patterns, drug treatment barriers, and HIV/hepatitis C virus risk behaviors. The findings suggest that women were not seeking treatment because they did not have sufficient knowledge about the negative effects of addiction, and feared that their confidentiality would be compromised. The study emphasized the need to provide culturally relevant information on addiction, and the benefits of women-specific drug treatments to engage more drug-using women to participate in treatment. Another project which Jones worked on relates to the clinical management of expecting mothers who are opioid dependent during pregnancy and after delivering their child. The findings from the MOTHER project were used to guide clinicians in the treatment of pregnant women who are addicted to opioids.  Representative Publications  *Jones, H.

Within the Czech Republic, it is considered the most important building of its kind. It is the first technical monument in the Plze≈à Region, that was declared a national cultural monument in 2010. The monument is administered by the Dr. Bohuslav Hor√°k Museum in Rokycany, which maintains a permanent exhibition here. History The present brick building was constructed at the beginning of the 19th century in the place of older wooden hammer mills from 1658 and 1701. The rich machinery is dated back to the 19th century. Originally, the hammer mill was used to refine blast-furnace raw iron and to produce bar forgings. After the development of later steel industry technologies, the hammer mill changed over to production of heavy forged tools in the late 1860s. In the second half of the 20th century, the production was stopped in the hammer mill and in the ironworks beneath it. The hammer mill became a museum exposition to document the old ways of industrial production Description The hammer stands in close proximity to the dam of Hu≈•sk√Ω pond. The adjacent drive feeds water through a wooden trough to the water wheels that drive the hammering equipment through the transmission system. Originally the iron-mill had five water wheels, today three are functional. The mill hall dimensions are 32√ó12 meters. In the interior there are forges, hammers of various sizes, grinding machines, bending machine, drills, presses and various tools. Water wheels power not only the equipment for the production of forged tools, but also the electricity generator. Each water wheel has an output of about 8 kW. Present When visiting the exposition it is possible to see how the mill works. While the fire in the forge is burning, and the wheels are spinning the museum guide, a blacksmith, operates a small tail hammer and on the anvil will forge a beautiful nail with a rounded head for the visitor, the same, which is custom-made for historic buildings today. Curious visitors interested in forging can learn a blacksmith's craft in an accelerated course, where they will learn to forge under a small iron-mill. =Reconstruction= In 2011 the iron-mill completed a major repair of the water drive at cost of 11 million CZK. Aged deposits of mud caused the water to stand in the drive and the technical equipment of the hammer mill was out of order. Therefore, it was necessary to completely mud about 900 meters long drive and solidify the banks. In 2017 the West Bohemian Museum in Plze≈à has received financial support (10 millions CZK) from the Integrated Regional Development Fund for the national monument revitalization. The project, scheduled for 2018-19, will restore the technical equipment, some dating from the 19th century. The permanent exposition on the history of the iron-mill, but also on the history of mining and processing of iron ore in the Brdy region will be expanded as well. Both activities date back to the 14th century, when the Ro≈æmberks founded the first smelters here. Recognition The hammer mill is a remarkable technical monument of this type with full equipment proving the original handicraft production commemorating the 500-year tradition of metallurgy in the Brdy region. It was declared a cultural monument in 1958 and a national cultural monument in 2010. It has been part of the Dob≈ô√≠v Rural monument zone since 1995. In 2010 the Czech National Bank issued a 2500 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Industrial Heritage Sites series. The coin was designed by Jaroslav Vesel√°k.

She was a granddaughter of French novelist, poet, and politician Victor Hugo. As an adult, Hugo was often written about in the press due to her status in Parisian high society and her connections to other members of the French elite.  Early life and family  Jeanne Hugo was born in Brussels on 29 September 1869, the third child of the journalist Charles Hugo and his wife Alice Le Haene. Her eldest brother died as an infant prior to her birth. Her surviving older brother was the artist Georges Victor-Hugo. Her paternal grandparents were the writer and politician Victor Hugo and Ad√®le Foucher. She was a great-granddaughter of Joseph L√©opold Sigisbert Hugo and Sophie Tr√©buchet. A member of a prominent literary and political family, her paternal grandfather had been ennobled as a Pairie de France by Louis Philippe I in 1845. Born in the last year of the Second French Empire, Hugo was raised in a staunch Republican household. Her family, former loyalists to the Bourbon monarchy, opposed the Bonapartes. She was the niece of L√©opoldine Hugo, Fran√ßois-Victor Hugo, and Ad√®le Hugo. Jeanne with her grandfather and brother in 1872. In 1871 Hugo's father died from a stroke. Her mother later remarried the actor √âdouard Lockroy. Hugo's grandfather did not approve of the new marriage, and took custody of Hugo and her brother, Georges. In 1877 she and her brother were the focus of her grandfather's book of poetry titled L'Art d'√™tre grand-p√®re. When she was eleven years old, she was gifted a walrus-tusk paper cutter by the Finno-Swedish explorer Baron Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld from his voyage in the Arctic Ocean aboard the SS Vega.

She was the aunt of the artist Jean Hugo.  Marriages  In 1891 Hugo married the journalist L√©on Daudet, the son of writers Alphonse Daudet and Julia Daudet. The marriage was performed in a civil ceremony and not a Catholic mass, out of respect for Hugo's grandfather, who had staunch anti-clerical views. The wedding was a major event in Parisian society, attracting crowds of onlookers. They divorced in 1895 and Hugo was awarded custody of their children, preventing Daudet from seeing them for thirteen years. In 1896 she married the scientist and explorer Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the son of neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. He named Hugo Island after her grandfather. She divorced Charcot in 1905 on the grounds of desertion. In 1906 Hugo married Michel Negroponte, a Greek naval officer. They remained married until his death in 1914.

Ickovics and her research team have been immensely focused on several studies including: identifying factors that influence recruitment; adherence retention in AIDS clinical trails; identifying the behavioral and psychological consequences of HIV counseling and testing for women; disaggregating the effects of race and social class on access to health care, health behaviors and health outcomes; and other research on the prevention of interventions, high-risk sexual behavior, access to health care, and health outcomes for people with HIV. These studies are important because they will help society and educate more people on the issues and consequences of having HIV/AIDS. Ickovics is impacting the society by creating more public policies and medical education reforms. Throughout her studies she focuses on underrepresented minority groups such as women with color; specifically Black and Latina young women. Jeannette R. Ickovics conducted a research in August 10, 1994 about the Limited Effects of HIV Counseling and Testing for Women. It was done in four community health clinics in Souther Connecticut. The health clinics provided the women with HIV counseling and testing and other specialized primary health care services. Ickovics and other researchers such as Allison C. Morrill, Susan E. Beren, Unjali Walsh, and Judith Rodin interviewed participants during recruitment. Two weeks to three months later the women received their results. Two groups of women were interviewed, one group of women were seeking HIV counseling and testing and the other group of women were never tested for HIV. All the women were matched for according to their race, age, and clinics. The outcomes of this research were the measures of sexual risks that were developed according to their sexual activities. Other risk factors were taken with these tests such as condom use with their partner. There were also measures taken according to the general psychological functioning and immunodeficiency syndrome of AIDS. The results of this study came out to be an average level of sexual risk was lower for women tested for HIV compared to the non-tested women. For the women that were tested had more knowledge and awareness about AIDS and had a lower change of getting AIDS after being counseled and tested. However, there weren't any significant change in sexual risks between these two groups of women in the 3-month study. The conclusion of this research was that the women who received counseling and testings on the behavioral and psychological consequences of HIV had a lower risk for obtaining HIV.

William Walker sought to appropriate Sonora, and in his claims he had the support of magnates and the complacency of the United States government . In November 1853 he embarked with two hundred men towards La Paz, where he was able to capture the political chief and proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Baja California, a state that never had recognition nor did it exist in the facts, since Walker never had total control of the peninsula or had the support of the population. Rather, he faced resistance from the army and Mexican civilians, among which the group commanded by Antonio Mel√©ndrez stands out . In spite of being folded in Ensenada and suffering the mutiny of his troops from the United States, Walker proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Sonora , which also included Baja California and that, like its successor, did not have existence in fact nor any recognition. In fact, Walker only reached the territory of Sonora in 1854 when pressured by the navy of the United States and Mexico, he had to flee Ensenada. Before the harassment of Mel√©ndrez and the desertion of another part of his troops, Walker and the remnant of his filibuistero army surrendered in San Diego to the American army. Taken to trial, the judge said he was guilty of violating the Neutrality Law signed between Mexico and the United States after the US invasion of Mexico in 1847 . However, Walker was acquitted by the jury.  Expedition to Baja California  William Walker was an American doctor and adventurer who had settled in California during the gold rush. He had tried to seize the state of Sonora before launching the Baja California campaign, which was carried out with the support of American magnates - probably among them was William Vanderbilt ; and within the framework of the omission of the California authorities regarding what was an illegal action against a foreign country. 173x173px The flag hoisted by William Walker has a star that represents the supposed \\"Republic of Baja California\\". Walker left California, in the company of a group of 45 American mercenaries, on October 17, 1853, with the intention of arriving in Guaymas ( Sonora ) and occupying that Mexican state. However, a year earlier the Mexicans had already repelled an expedition of French filibusters, major in troops and military preparation. Perhaps this made him reconsider Walker, who chose to attack and first take the California peninsula as the first step to seize Sonora. On board the schooner Caroline, the Walker expedition arrived in Cabo San Lucas on October 28of that year. He moved by sea to La Paz, capital of the territory of Baja California, which he occupied five days later by capturing Rafael Espinosa, political head of the territory. In that place, the filibusters lowered the Mexican flag and raised in its place a flag of three horizontal stripes, two red and one white in the center, loaded with two stars representing Baja California and Sonora. 1 The 3 of November 1853, the invaders proclaimed the independence of the peninsula which they called Republic of Baja California. Later, the expedition captured Colonel Juan Cl√≠maco Rebolledo, who came to replace Espinosa in the position of political chief without knowing that the Baja California capital had been taken by the American invaders. 173x173px The second flag raised by William Walker has two stars representing the \\"Republic of Baja California and Sonora\\". Since the reinforcements of the expedition from California were slow to arrive, Walker decided to move his operations center to the north of the peninsula, near the border with the United States and the passage by land to Sonora, which was the objective of his ambitions and also those of the US government, which had already expressed its intention to buy the northwest of Mexico. In La Paz there were some clashes between civilians and filibusters, which Walker interpreted as military victories over the Mexican government, which he accused of tyrant and decadent. Already in Ensenada, the filibusters established their headquarters in what are currently the Third and Gast√©lum streets of that city. 2From there, Walker issued a proclamation to the American people, requesting their support to defend the independence of Baja California, of which he had named himself president. Many American volunteers adhered to Walker's call, adding up to a number of 253 expedition members who arrived in Ensenada on the Anita ship .

It covers multiple success stories of plant-based athletes, references scientific studies, and touches on other arguments for plant-based diets that extend to non-athletes. It received generally positive reviews by viewers and endorsement by several health organizations, among them the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and the Defense Health Agency, but also received criticism for scientific inaccuracies and a perceived unbalanced support for plant-based nutrition, with several experts accusing it of misinformation and pseudoscience. Overview The documentary follows former UFC fighter James Wilks who, while recovering from an injury, researches nutrition, and travels the world to discuss his findings with elite athletes who follow plant-based diets. Athletes interviewed in the film include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrik Baboumian, and Dotsie Bausch. Release The Game Changers debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, with a second edit released worldwide for a one-day screening in September 2019. The film has over a dozen executive producers, including James Cameron, Pamela Anderson, Rip Esselstyn, Jackie Chan and Brendan Brazier. Featured individuals :In order of appearance * James Wilks * Scott Jurek * Morgan Mitchell * Dotsie Bausch * Kendrick Farris * Patrik Baboumian * Bryant Jennings * Griff Whalen * Derrick Morgan * Caldwell Esselstyn * Dean Ornish * Kim Williams * Rip Esselstyn * Lucious Smith * Arnold Schwarzenegger * Walter Willett * Richard Wrangham * Christina Warinner * Mark Thomas * David Katz * Johan Rockstr√∂m * Lewis Hamilton Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 70% based on reviews from 10 critics. Several celebrities declared themselves impacted by The Game Changers, with actor Dolph Lundgren and bakery businessman Roger Whiteside deciding to follow a vegan diet after watching it. It was approved by and made with the collaboration of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, as well as the Defense Health Agency, which officially endorsed it. =Criticisms= Despite its overall reception, the documentary came under heavy criticism not only from sports, science and nutrition sectors, but also from other defenders of plant-based diets. Critics pointed out factual inaccuracies in the information presented, a misleading usage of data taken out of context, and flawed arguments against both meat and dairy in favor of pro-vegan interests. They also attacked the documentary's claims that \\"meat and dairy industry secretly fund all the studies that demonstrate any benefits to animal products,\\" not only labelling this as a factually incorrect conspiracy theory, but also comparing that, conversely, all the experts and medical professionals partaking in the documentary were also sellers of vegan products (including the film's executive producer, James Cameron, an outspoken vegan who founded plant protein company Verdient Foods). Addressing the conclusions presented in Game Changers and general tone of the documentary, nutrition PhD Layne Norton stated, \\"the film used strawman, false dichotomies, cherry picking, and a whole host of other logical fallacies in an attempt to demonize animals products and make vegan diet the solution to the world's problems.\\" However, Men's Health editor Paul Kita would also expand on Wilks's purported intention to present objective facts, commenting that the documentary \\"presents only one side of the facts, often via controversial sources, grand extrapolations from small studies, and statements that are flat-out misleading.\\" Sports nutrition expert Asker Jeukendrup was quoted as saying, \\"Game Changers ticks almost all the boxes of pseudoscience, and none of the boxes of science,\\" an opinion echoed by other reviewers. Those critiques attracted responses from the vegan community, with Dr. Garth Davis accusing Norton particularly of making his analysis \\"a story line that sounds credible to the lay person ear but truly misrepresents the movie and the science presented in the movie.\\" Viewers asked Norton in Twitter about Davis's article, but he declined to comment, instead challenging Davis to debate him in person. =The Joe Rogan Experience= On November 21, 2019, Joe Rogan addressed the documentary on his The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which featured the presence of Chris Kresser, paleolithic diet proponent and co-director of the California Center for Functional Medicine. Both Rogan and Kresser harshly criticized the documentary, with the latter accusing it of scientific dishonesty on the show and writing shortly after a lengthy analysis on his website. Kresser described The Game Changers as being \\"full of misleading statements, half-truths, flat-out falsehoods, flawed logic, and absurdities.\\" In order to host a proper debate between the sides, Rogan invited both Kresser and The Game Changers creator James Wilks to the podcast's December 5, 2019 edition. The resultant debate lasted four hours and saw Wilks engaging Kresser's criticisms, eventually making the paleolithic diet advocate concede mistakes about vitamin B12 livestock supply. Notably, Rogan himself stated to have changed his own posture, praising Wilks' defense of his position and even considering taking down the previous episode from his channel. He was quoted as saying, \\"James knocked it out of the park and defended himself and the film quite spectacularly.\\" Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred in the documentary as a guest, commended Rogan for \\"always having an open mind.\\" Audience reception echoed Schwarzenegger, not only within the vegan community, with some viewers even suggesting to next pit Wilks against another of his critics, Layne Norton. Rogan contacted him leading Norton to give his opinion on the debate, which took the form of a post on his own website. In his answer, Norton admitted that Wilks excelled at preparing for the debate, but argued that he \\"seemed focussed on destroying Chris rather than defending the film‚Äôs claims\\" and \\"committed an atrocity of logical fallacies and misrepresented key pieces of research to suit his bias.\\" References External links  * Category:2018 films Category:American documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about vegetarianism Category:Veganism Category:American films ","title":"The Game Changers"},{"id":"61920573","text":"Sonshine and Broccoli are a Canadian children's music duo, consisting of Lisa Sonshine and Brock Burford.Ania Bessonov, \\"Sonshine and Broccoli hope to spread a little love\\".

Construction began in January 2019 and was completed in 2020 with 80 Vestas wind turbines with a capacity to generate 336MW of electricity. The drive trains and hubs were assembled at the former Ford Australia site in Geelong. The wind farm is the largest in Victoria, soon to be overtaken by Stockyard Hill. It has contracts to supply 37% of its output to the government of Victoria and 50% to Snowy Hydro. It is being developed by Tilt Renewables. The wind farm connects to the grid via 38 kilometres of 220kV overhead transmission line to a substation near the Mortlake Power Station. A 327 tonne transformer transported at night took four nights to reach Dundonnell from Glen Waverley in eastern Melbourne in August 2019. It was manufactured there by the Wilson Transformer Company. The developer spent $80 million to connect the wind farm to the main 500 kV grid via a 38 km 220 kV Ausnet line, avoiding the connection problems many other generating stations have in the interior. Full commissioning was delayed in mid-2020 due to concerns of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), despite it being commissioned according to a plan negotiated with AEMO in 2018.

Catalytic reactions occurring on surfaces that undergo variation in surface binding energy and/or entropy exhibit overall increase in reaction rate when the surface binding energy frequencies are comparable to the natural frequencies of the surface reaction, adsorption, and desorption. History Oscillation of surface binding energy on a Sabatier volcano plot (red) at resonance conditions occurs at the tie line (purple) for maximum average reaction rate Catalytic resonance theory is constructed on the Sabatier principle of catalysis developed by French chemistry Paul Sabatier. In the limit of maximum catalytic performance, the surface of a catalyst is neither too strong nor too weak. Strong binding results in an overall catalytic reaction rate limitation due to product desorption, while weak binding catalysts are limited in the rate of surface chemistry. Optimal catalyst performance is depicted as a 'volcano' peak using a descriptor of the chemical reaction defining different catalytic materials. Experimental evidence of the Sabatier principle was first demonstrated by Balandin in 1960. The concept of catalytic resonance was proposed on dynamic interpretation of the Sabatier volcano reaction plot. As described, extension of either side of the volcano plot above the peak defines the timescales of the two rate-limiting phenomena such as surface reaction(s) or desorption. For binding energy oscillation amplitudes that extend across the volcano peak, the amplitude endpoints intersect the transiently accessible faster timescales of independent reaction phenomena. At the conditions of sufficiently fast binding energy oscillation, the transient binding energy variation frequency matches the natural frequencies of the reaction and the rate of overall reaction achieves turnover frequencies greatly in excess of the volcano plot peak. Theory  The basis of catalytic resonance theory utilizes the transient behavior of adsorption, surface reactions, and desorption as surface binding energy and surface transition states oscillate with time. The binding energy of a single species, i, is described via a temporal functional including square or sinusoidal waves of frequency, fi, and amplitude, dUi: :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{i,ads}(t) = \\\\Delta H_\\\\text{0} + \\\\Delta U\\\\sin(f_i t), Other surface chemical species, j, are related to the oscillating species, i, by the constant linear parameter, gamma Œ≥i-j: :\\\\gamma_\\\\text{i-j} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{i,ads}(t)}{\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{j,ads}(t)} Response of an A-to-B reversible unimolecular catalytic reaction to a sinusoidal oscillation in surface binding energy. The two surface species also share the common enthalpy of adsorption, delta Œ¥i-j. Specification of the oscillation frequency and amplitude of species i and relating Œ≥i-j and Œ¥i-j for all other surface species j permits determination of all chemical surface species adsorption enthalpy with time. The transition state energy of a surface reaction between any two species i and j is predicted by the linear scaling relationship of the Bell‚ÄìEvans‚ÄìPolanyi principle which relates to the surface reaction enthalpy, ŒîHi-j, to the transition state energy, Ea, by parameters Œ± and Œ≤ with the following relationship: :E_a,_{i-j} (t) = \\\\beta + \\\\alpha\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{i,j} (t) The oscillating surface and transition state energies of chemical species alter the kinetic rate constants associated with surface reaction, adsorption, and desorption. The surface reaction rate constant of species i converting to surface species j includes the dynamic activation energy: :k_{i-j}(t,T) = Ae^\\\\frac{-E_{\\\\rm a, i-j}(t)}{RT}, The resulting surface chemistry kinetics are then described via a surface reaction rate expression containing dynamic kinetic parameters responding to the oscillation in surface binding energy: :\\\\frac{d\\\\theta_{i}(t)}{dt} = k_{ads,i}P_{i}\\\\theta_{*}(t) - k_{des,i}(t)\\\\theta_{i}(t) + \\\\sum_{k=1}^N { u_{i,k}r_k(t,T)}, with k reactions with dynamic activation energy. The desorption rate constant also varies with oscillating surface binding energy by: : k_{des,i}(t) = A_{des,i}e^{\\\\left \\\\lbrack \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H_{ads,i}(t)}{RT} \\\\right \\\\rbrack} . Implementation of dynamic surface binding energy of a reversible A-to-B reaction on a heterogeneous catalyst in a continuous flow stirred tank reactor operating at 1% conversion of A produces a sinusoidal binding energy in species B as shown. In the transition between surface binding energy amplitude endpoints, the instantaneous reaction rate (i.e., turnover frequency) oscillates over an order of magnitude as a limit cycle solution. Implications for Chemistry The catalytic reaction rate of a surface with oscillating binding energy exhibits a band of resonance frequencies of high total reaction rate Oscillating binding energies of all surface chemical species introduces periodic instances of transient behavior to the catalytic surface. For slow oscillation frequencies, the transient period is only a small quantity of the oscillation time scale, and the surface reaction achieves a new steady state. However, as the oscillation frequency increases, the surface transient period approaches the timescale of the oscillation and the catalytic surface remains in a constant transient condition. A plot of the averaged turnover frequency of a reaction with respect to applied oscillation frequency identifies the 'resonant' frequency range for which the transient conditions of the catalyst surface match the applied frequencies. The 'resonance band' exists above the Sabatier volcano plot maximum of a static system with average reaction rates as high as five orders of magnitude faster than that achievable by conventional catalysis. The catalytic reactions of A-to-B and A-to-C can be controlled by applying dynamic binding energy to the surface with varying applied frequency and fixed amplitude starting at varying energies. Surface binding energy oscillation also occurs to different extent with the various chemical surface species as defined by the Œ≥i-j parameter. For any non-unity Œ≥i-j system, the asymmetry in the surface energy profile results in conducting work to bias the reaction to a steady state away from equilibrium. Similar to the controlled directionality of molecular machines, the resulting ratchet (device) energy mechanism selectively moves molecules through a catalytic reaction against a free energy gradient. Application of dynamic binding energy to a surface with multiple catalytic reactions exhibits complex behavior derived from the differences in the natural frequencies of each chemistry; these frequencies are identified by the inverse of the adsorption, desorption, and surface kinetic rate parameters. Considering a system of two parallel elementary reactions of A-to-B and A-to-C that only occur on a surface, the performance of the catalyst under dynamic conditions will result in varying capability for selecting either reaction product (B or C). For the depicted system, both reactions have the same overall thermodynamics and will produce B and C in equal amounts (50% selectivity) at chemical equilibrium. Under normal static catalyst operation, only product B can be produced at selectivities greater than 50% and product C is never favored. However, as shown, the application of surface binding dynamics in the form of a square wave at varying frequency and fixed oscillation amplitude but varying endpoints exhibits the full range of possible reactant selectivity. In the range of 1-10 Hertz, there exists a small island of parameters for which product C is highly selective; this condition is only accessible via dynamics. Experiments and Evidence In 2020, dynamic oscillation of a catalyst above a static optimum rate was demonstrated for the first time. Using the formic acid electro-oxidation reaction, oscillation of the applied electrodynamic potential between 0 and 0.8 volts accelerated the formation rate of carbon dioxide more than an order of magnitude higher (20X) than what was achievable on platinum, the best existing catalyst. The maximum catalytic rate was experimentally observed at a frequency of 100 Hz; slower catalytic rates were observed at higher and lower electrodynamic frequencies. The resonant frequency was interpreted as the oscillation between conditions favorable to formic acid decomposition (0 V) and conditions favorable to form CO2 (0.8 V).

Origin  The origin of M√ºller Matz (\\"Matz the Miller\\") may lie in a Russian card game called Melniki (Russian for \\"miller\\"). Most of the rules are the same. According to Rozaliev (1991), Melniki was a family game that was played by adults and children to while away their leisure time. He believed that it died out during the 20th century and was no longer encountered today, although Bernd Baron von Maydell has suggested that M√ºller Matz is still played by Baltic-German families. According to Grimm (1768), the term \\"Matz\\" was used as the name of a lowly or foolish man and thus corresponds to the Russian word Durak (\\"fool\\"). Since the first part of M√ºller Matz in particular resembles the well-known Russian card game, Durak, this may be an alternative origin of the game and its name.  Rules  If two to four play, one full pack of 52 cards is used minus the Jokers. If more play, two packs are used. Cards rank in their natural order, Aces high. Players play with their hand cards face down. The game comprises two parts, known as 'lives' (Leben). The winner is the player who, at the end of the second life, is the first to shed all his cards. = First Life = The aim of the first life is to be able to start the second life with a good hand of cards. A general strategy is to collect trumps and high cards in each suit as far as possible, ready for the second life, but not too many. Each player is dealt three cards initially; the rest are placed face down as a stock in the middle of the table. A card is turned and placed next to it to determine trumps. Players may exchange a Six or a Two for it, but only when it is their turn. The cards are held face down. The player to the left of the dealer begins by playing a card to the player on his or her left. There are now three options: # He can beat the card, either with a higher one of the same suit or any trump card. He then lays both cards face down in front of him for his second life and may then play a card to his left- hand neighbour. # He may discard a lower card, but he must then take both cards with him into the pile for his second life and then may play a card to his left. If two packs are used, the one to whom the first card was led, if he plays the same card, may decide whether to give the cards up or use them for his second life. # He can pick up the card; but may not then play a card. The turn passes to his left neighbour. As a result, players may end up with four or more cards in their hand. Players may draw a fresh card from the stock when they only have 2 cards left in their hand. N.B. it is important not to forget to always draw a new card from the stock if you have fewer than three hand cards. If you have three trumps in your hand, you may \\"go to sleep\\", which means that you can lay them all down for your second life and replenish your hand with three more. When the stock in the middle is exhausted, play continues until only one player has cards left in his hand, whereupon the first life is ended and the second one begins. When the stock is used up, players may 'go to sleep' with two trumps or a single trump. = Second Life = Play begins with the player who, in the first life, was first to shed their cards. He plays a card to the middle of the table, ideally the lowest card of his longest suit. His left-hand neighbour has 3 options: # He can follow it with a higher card of the same suit, playing it onto the led card(s). # He can follow suit with a (higher) trump (preferably with his lowest trump), then the next player(s) must play trumps. # He can pick up the last card played to the middle, because he cannot or does not want to follow suit. Then turn passes to the next player to the left. As soon as there are as many cards in the middle as there are players, the last card wins and the cards are taken out of play. The one who played the last card, leads to the next trick. The first player to shed all his cards has won. But this does not end the game; the remaining players continue to play. If cards are left on the table when a player goes out, they will still be beaten when there are as many cards as the number of players at the start of the trick. As soon as a new trick is started, it is won when the number of cards equals the, now reduced, number of players. The player who is the last to have cards in his hand has lost. In popular culture The game is mentioned in Else Hueck-Dehio's Tipsy's Special Love Life (Tipsys sonderliche Liebesgeschichte, 1959) which was set around the turn of the century (1900s). When Tipsy is asked to marry, she justifies her refusal by saying: \\"You are wasting your money in the most unsound way... Yes, you play. You sit on the cliffs of Monte Carlo and play M√ºller Matz with the Prince of Monaco.\\"  References   Literature  Grimm, J. (1768‚Äì70). Vol. 12. * Rozaliev, Nikolaj (1991).

Life Kosheverova was born in St. Petersburg to Nikolai Kosheverov, a merchant with a house on Sergievskaya Street. As a girl she was fond of dolls and puppets, which she explained as her inspiration for entering the world of cinema: \\"The cinema is like a puppet theater, because a lot of people work on creating the film, and the viewer sees only what they are supposed to see.\\" In 1923 she graduated from the acting school of the Bolshaya Komediya Theater and until 1928 worked as an actress in the theaters of Leningrad, including at Leningrad Comedy Theatre under Nikolay Akimov. In the late twenties she studied at the (FEKS), an avant-garde acting collective. Beginning in 1929 she worked at Lenfilm, first as an assistant director on The Youth of Maxim (1934), The Return of Maxim (1937), and The Vyborg Side (1939). Her first effort as a director was Once in Autumn (1937), which has since been lost. Her first success was the musical comedy Arinka (1939), directed in collaboration with Yuri Muzykant. Before the outbreak of World War II she directed Galya, a film whose subject matter (related to the Winter War) led to its being banned from release. In 1944 Kosheverova turned to the fairy tale genre, which would remain her main focus for the rest of her career. Her first fairy-tale feature was the film-opera Cherevichki (1944), directed in collaboration with . In 1947 she experienced considerable success with Cinderella, another collaboration with Shapiro. The film was praised for its performances and script by Evgeny Schwartz. Kosheverova would go on to create other hit comedies (Shofyor Ponyevolye (1958) and Be Careful, Grandma! (1960). Several of her films starred Oleg Dahl. In 1963 Kosheverova and Mikhail Shapiro collaborated on Cain XVIII, a fairy tale film with political undertones, and a script by Nikolai Erdman. The script was carefully revised to avoid giving offense to the censors, but a scene of cross-dressing infuriated Nikita Khrushchev, who ordered the film banned as \\"homosexual propaganda\\". It was not shown again until the 1990s. Kosheverova's last directorial work was the 1987 film The Tale of the Painter in Love. She died in Moscow on 22 February 1989, and is buried in the village of Komarovo near St. Petersburg. Family Her first husband was film director Nikolay Akimov, with whom she collaborated on the films Cinderella and Shadows. Her second husband was the director of photography Andrei Moskvin, her collaborator on the Maxim films and The Vyborg Side. Her second marriage produced a son, Nikolai.

The series is based on the DC Comics character Kate Kane / Batwoman, a costumed vigilante created by Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, and Keith Giffen, and is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with other Arrowverse television series. The showrunner for this season is Caroline Dries. Ruby Rose stars as Kate, and she is joined by main cast members Rachel Skarsten, Meagan Tandy, Nicole Kang, Camrus Johnson, Elizabeth Anweis and Dougray Scott. Rose previously appeared as a guest actor in the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover. Batwoman was picked up for a full season by The CW in October 2019, and filming took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia. Production was shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the season with only 20 of the planned 22 episodes. The series premiere was watched by 1.86 million viewers and had a 0.5 18‚Äì49 demographic rating.

In July 2018, it was reported that the CW was planning to develop a series around the character, to air in 2019 if picked up. The series, said to only be a \\"script-development deal\\", was written by Caroline Dries, who would also serve as an executive producer with Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schecter, and the character's co-creator Geoff Johns. The series would be produced by Berlanti Productions and Mad Ghost Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. The following month, Pedowitz noted the pilot would be completed \\"for mid-season\\". In December 2018, Dries submitted a \\"strong\\" script for a potential pilot episode, according to Nellie Andreeva of Deadline Hollywood. That led to the series receiving a pilot order from the CW the next month, to be considered for a series order in the 2019‚Äì20 television season. As of April 2019, the series was considered \\"a lock\\" at The CW, and reportedly had a writing staff in place. On May 7, 2019, The CW ordered the show to series. On October 25, 2019, the series was picked up for a full season of 22 episodes. = Writing = The Batwoman origin story presented in the series is adapted from the Elegy comic book story arc. The events up to the fourth episode predate Batwoman's appearance in \\"Elseworlds\\", after which the events surpass the crossover. = Casting = Casting for Kate Kane was expected to begin after the announcement of the intended series in May 2018, with the intention of casting an out lesbian actress. In August, Ruby Rose was cast as Kate Kane / Batwoman. In late January 2019, Meagan Tandy, Camrus Johnson, and Nicole Kang were cast in the series regular roles as Sophie Moore, Luke Fox, and Mary Hamilton, respectively. This was followed shortly by the casting of Rachel Skarsten as Alice, Dougray Scott as Jacob Kane, and Elizabeth Anweis as Catherine Hamilton-Kane. According to Kang, Mary and Catherine were not specifically written as being non-white, but Dries and Greg Berlanti decided to \\"reveal or explore more types of people who live\\" in Gotham City, so both characters were written as Asian Americans, keeping with the fact that both Kang and Anweis are Korean Americans. The casting of Rose as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and received intense criticism. DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online reactions attacked Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the criticism was the assertion that the fact she identifies as gender fluid made her \\"not gay enough.\\" Rose left Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash. On August 21, 2019, Sam Littlefield was cast in a recurring role. In July, Burt Ward was cast for the Batwoman part in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". On October 4, 2019, Rachel Maddow and Sebastian Roch√© were cast in recurring capacities. = Filming = Production on the pilot episode began on March 4 and concluded on March 25, 2019, in Vancouver, British Columbia. Additional filming took place in Chicago, Illinois. David Nutter had been chosen to serve as director and executive producer on the pilot in January 2019, but by mid-February, left the project for personal reasons. Nutter remained an executive producer on the episode, with Marcos Siega replacing him as director and also serving as an executive producer. Filming for the rest of the season began on July 4 and was set to conclude in mid-2020. On March 12, 2020, Warner Bros. Television shut down production on the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season had one additional day of shooting on episode 20, which could not happen because of the shut down. Dries said they were \\"lucky\\" despite this, because the last day of filming concluded the \\"important\\" Alice/Mouse storyline, resulting in \\"a solid episode\\" with what had been filmed.  Release  = Broadcast = The season debuted on October 6, 2019. It was originally set to run for 22 episodes, but as the 21st and 22nd episodes could not be filmed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 20th episode was announced as the finale. = Marketing = On May 16, 2019, The CW released the first official trailer for the series. The trailer received a negative reaction on YouTube, with viewers accusing it of an overemphasis on feminism. The trailer received 86,000 \\"likes\\" compared to 428,000 \\"dislikes\\" by August 22, 2019. Comic Book compared the backlash against a perceived agenda to that suffered by 2019's Captain Marvel and its actress Brie Larson. Alex Dalbey of The Daily Dot noted how the trailer received a range of angry reactions, but nonetheless felt that criticism of the trailer's focus on the protagonist being a woman was valid, which she found to be \\"forced\\" and \\"hamfisted\\" via the dialogue and choice of song. Dalbey also wrote: \\"It's 2019; we have Wonder Woman, Black Widow, Supergirl, Jessica Jones, Spider-Gwen, Captain Marvel and more. Batwoman isn't even the first lesbian superhero on the CW, there's also Thunder in Black Lightning.\\" However, Jean Bentley of The Hollywood Reporter noted, \\"The character of Batwoman, aka Batman's cousin, Kate Kane, is the first lesbian superhero to headline her own series.\\"  Reception  = Ratings = = Critical response = On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an approval rating of 80% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.87/10. It also holds the Certified Fresh designation. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it needs more time to develop its own identity to truly soar, Batwoman fun and stylish first season is a step in the right direction for representation and superhero shows alike.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

His roots are in Western Canada. 2017 Thoughts on Chinese politics VanderKlippe argued in November 2017 that China has become \\"evangelical\\" about its national development model, in a live interview that occurred soon after Xi Jinping was promoted to Chinese leader-for-life. He remarked on China's self-promotion as a \\"role model for the world\\", and noted the Belt and Road forum that Chinese diplomats were hawking, and how the Chinese model is a very state-run and authoritarian system, with motivations which seem puzzling to Western people. He feels that the Chinese development model does not work without the Chinese political model, and no political dissent is tolerated in China. The media in China has become more self- censored, and he remarked on CGTN, a state-run TV channel like the CBC. The Foreign Ministry of China has been unhappy with several of his reports. Chinese academics are very reluctant to talk to him about internal political developments. He remarked that in places like Myanmar people look toward China as the \\"city on a hill\\", because of its stability and economic opportunity. VanderKlippe observed that the Chinese Communist Party was setting up committees inside of private corporations, including foreign owned corporations, and that the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector, which distorts entire markets, dominates in China. SOEs, among other ends, provide social welfare and can become zombie corporations. The Harper government had two distinct eras, a hostile era and a friendly era. The Trudeau government seemed to be committed to develop their trade relationship, and seemed more willing to listen than to criticize. China looked favourably on the first political appointee as Ambassador in John McCallum. VanderKlippe feels that the South China Sea was given up by the Obama administration to the Chinese, and the Japanese lament their loss of leadership to China. The Philippines have not enforced the international court judgment over the South China Sea, ostensibly because of massive investment and aid from China into the Philippines after the judgment was released. Sympathy for the Rohyinga VanderKlippe has great sympathy for the Rohingya people of Myanmar. On Japan VanderKlippe observed that the North Korean nuclear programme, and specifically the 2017 North Korean thermonuclear test caused the Japanese to reconsider their prohibition of nuclear weapons on Japanese soil.

Nothing is known about Quijano's early years, including the date and place of his birth. His name first appears in records at the time of his appointment to the position of \\"composer and music teacher\\" at the Teatro de la Cruz in Madrid, which he took in the 1814-15 season. He was heavily active in the city's musical and cultural life, serving as well as the music director at the Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe. At the foundation of the Liceo Art√≠stico y Literario in 1837, he was listed as one of the musicians involved. In 1819, at the death of Carlos IV, he was selected to design the musical program for the funeral.

The formation of the Central People's Government of the PRC, the government of the new nation, was officially proclaimed during the proclamation speech at the founding ceremony. The first public military parade of the then new People's Liberation Army took place there, following the chairman's address of the formal foundation of the people's republic. Before this, as the new national anthem March of the Volunteers was played, the new national flag of the People's Republic of China was officially unveiled to the newly founded nation and hoisted for the first time during the celebrations as a 21-gun salute fired in the distance.  Historical Background  The Chinese Civil War was fought between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) lasting intermittently between 1927 and 1949. The war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude: from August 1927 to 1937, the KMT-CPC Alliance collapsed during the Northern Expedition, and the Nationalists controlled most of China. From 1937 to 1945, hostilities were put on hold, and the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the World War II Allies. The civil war resumed with the Japanese defeat, and the CPC gained the upper hand in the final phase of the war from 1945-1949, generally referred to as the Chinese Communist Revolution. Major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing its territory to only Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 21 September 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China with a speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This was followed by a mass celebration in Tiananmen Square on 1 October, at which the proclamation was made publicly by Mao at the Tiananmen Gate, the date becoming the new country's first National Day.  Declaration  At exactly 3:00pm Beijing Time on 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong pronounced to the nation from the top of the Tiananmen Gate: After the national anthem had been played, Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China that day on top of the Tiananmen Gate, declaring:  Celebrations  The first National Day military parade took place right after the proclamation of the PRC. Commanded by Nie Rongzhen, the Commander of the Northern China Military Region and inspected by Zhu De, the Commander-in- Chief of the PLA, the parade involved around 16,000 PLA officers and personnel.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/02/93548261.html?zoom=15&pageNumber;=1 The parade, which was approved in June 1949, was the first large-scale and modern Chinese military parade, with the country having never done a public review of troops before under previous governments. Liu Bocheng proposed to parade directors Yang Chengwu and Tang Yanjie be organized in the Soviet format, having personally witnessed a military parade on Red Square in Moscow. The Northern Military Region Band (now the Central Military Band of the PLA) provided musical accompaniment which included the Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army‚Äô'.

He was also a member of the Senate of the United States of Indonesia, representing West Kalimantan, member of the People's Representative Council from 1950 until 1956, and the member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia from 1956 until 1959. Early life Agustinus Jelani was born on August 28, 1919 in Putussibau, West Kalimantan. He began his studies at the C. V. O. Seminarium, which he finished in 1937. Later on, he went to the Intermediate Seminary, which he entered in 1941, and finished in 1944.Syahrul Hidayat and Kevin W. Fogg, \\"Member Profiles: Agustinus Djelani,\\" Konstituante.Net (1 January 2018), accessed 30 September 2019 After that, he went to the Grand Seminary of Philosophy in Flores, and finished it in 1946.  Political career  = In the Dayak Unity Party = After he finished his studies, he went back to his hometown, West Kalimantan, and found himself heavily participated in the Dayak Unity Party. After the establishment of the party on 1 October 1946, he was assigned as the adviser to the party. He would later assume the position as the chairman of the party on 12 May 1947, replacing Oevaang Oeray, as he was appointed as the member of the Daily Government Agency of the newly formed Autonomous Region of West Kalimantan. Concurrently with his appointment as the chairman of the party, the Autonomous Region of West Kalimantan was established. The autonomous region was incorporated into the United States of Indonesia. Jelani was appointed as the member of the Senate of the United States of Indonesia in 16 February 1950. The senate was short lived, as it would later dissolved on 16 August 1950, and the members of the senate were appointed in the People's Representative Council. Jelani became the member of the council from 16 August 1950 until 30 March 1956. After the new council based on the 1955 election was formed, Jelani was nominated as the member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in the 1955 Indonesian Constitutional Assembly election. The Dayak Unity Party won 169,222 votes in the election, or 0.45% of the total votes, allowing the party to have three representatives seated in the assembly. Jaelani was elected, alongside with Oevaang Oeray and Willibrordus Hittam. Due to the minimal recognition of the Dayak Unity Party at the national level, Jelani was listed as the member of the Catholic Party during his term as the member of the senate and the council. Only after the 1955 elections, he was listed as the member of the Dayak Unity Party. In the Indonesian local elections, the local elections for the regional council of the West Kalimantan were conducted on 22 May 1958. The result was a great success for the party, which obtained more than 40% of the votes in the election, allowing it to had 37,2% seats in the local councils of West Kalimantan. In the Pontianak Regency, the regional council was seated by 13 representatives of the party. Due to the majority of the party in the council, the council elected Djelani as the regent of the Pontianak Regency on 13 October 1958. Djelani was officially appointed on 16 April 1959, replacing Raden Koesno. After the rise of Suharto as the president of Indonesia, most of the governors or regents from non-military background were replaced by those who had military background. In the Pontianak Regency, Djelani was replaced by Colonel Gusti Usman Idris in 1966. Idris had previously served as the speaker of the regional council of the regency. Djelani was appointed as the advisors to Idris. = In Partindo and IPKI = After the dissolution of the Dayak Unity Party, there were two factions of the party. The nationalist faction, which was led by Oevaang Oeray, fused into the Partindo. The religious faction, which was led by F. C. Palaunsuka, joined the Catholic Party. Jelani joined the Partindo in 1963. After the failed 30 September Movement, Partindo was considered as a Marxist organization in Indonesia. To avoid the persecution of the former Dayak Unity Party members in Partindo, Jelani and Oevaang Oeray cooperated with local militer forces, and moved those former members of the Dayak Unity Party into the League of Supporters of Indonesian Independence (IPKI). = In Golkar = Even though IPKI would later fused into the Indonesian Democratic Party in 1973, authorities in West Kalimantan had threatened to arrest ex-Partindo members in IPKI to join Golkar since the early 1970. The authorities began by transferring Oevaang Oeray, the leader of the ex-Partindo members, to Jakarta. The move was seen as to reduce the influence of Dayak politics. Oeray initially refused to comply with the transfer. Not until 20 March 1971 did he finally decide to leave; it was clear that arrest by the military was imminent if he refused to board the plane to Jakarta. The departure of Oeray to Jakarta influenced Dayaks who still joined IPKI. On 17 April 1971, Jelani, along with four other Dayak leaders, publicly announced that they were joining Golkar.

Several archeological digs have taken place on the site that have revealed evidence of Christian activity on the site early as the fifth century. Evidence of earlier pagan worship and burials have also been found. The current state of the site is in ruin, as a result of the mid 17th century Cromwellian forces most likely headed by Henry Ireton. More recently evidence of an earlier wooden structure has been found near to the site of the ruined stone church. Location Kiltullagh Church is located on Kiltullagh Hill, which is to the South West of Ballinlough in County Roscommon. History Kiltullagh Church has an extensive history dating back to the fifth century AD. Archeological digs have established Christian activity back to that date. Before that period, researchers have found evidence of pagan burials on the same site. Excavations by the University of Belfast have dated the remains of the current structure to 1441. The now-ruined building is believed to have been destroyed in the mid seventeenth century by forces under the command of Henry Ireton, the son of Oliver Cromwell, who was responsible for the majority of the destruction of the religious sites in Ireland at the time. Before the building of the present structure of the Church, a monastery was situated on top of the hill. Though little is known about the older Franciscan Monastery, its foundations can be observed on the east side of the remaining structure, though much overgrown. Building Little of the original structure remain, The nave and elements of the surrounding walls and transepts still clearly be seen. As the interior is in ruin, the nave is now used to house graves of the dead. Present day KILTULLAGH HILL, KILTULLAGH, Roscommon Although still part of the local parish, the church is infrequently used today due to its remote location and ruined state. Its chief use is for the visitation of relatives buried in its grounds, and as a viewpoint for Lough O'Flynn.

It is Tokarczuk's third novel and was highly successful. It is set in the fictitious village of Prawiek (Primeval) at the very heart of Poland, which is populated by some eccentric, archetypical characters. The novel chronicles the lives of Prawiek's inhabitants over a period of eight decades, beginning in 1914. It has been translated into many languages (published in English in Antonia Lloyd-Jones' translation by Twisted Spoon Press in 2009) and established Tokarczuk's international reputation as one of the most important representatives of Polish literature in her generation. Structure The novel is divided into 60 short vignettes, each focusing on different fictional characters in different periods of time. According to Tokarczuk, this fragmentary form of storytelling, which she further explored in Dom dzienny, dom nocny (\\"House of Day, House of Night\\", 1998), is representative of the novel's perception of reality. According to the author, the style of writing arouses this fragmentary perception and conveys that the separate vignettes are part of something greater. Tokarczuk was not fully conscious of the structure's purpose when she wrote the novel, but she strongly defended it against the publisher who suggested changing it. The novel contains elements of fantasy mixed with magic realism. Setting In developing the setting for the novel, Olga Tokarczuk modeled after the village of Zagrody, located in the Kielce region, where she spent her childhood holidays. Tokarczuk emphasized, however, that although it owes its topography to that of Zagrody, Prawiek is a fictional village of her own creation. Tokarczuk has rejected linking characters presented in the book with the real inhabitants of Zagrody. The attempts by journalists to do so in the 1990s she considered outrageous. In 2012, inhabitants of Stasz√≥w County organized a project to document the locations presented in the novel through photography. Reception After its publication, the novel was reviewed by many Polish critics. wrote that \\"Olga's time\\" in literature had come, describing her prose as one of the most captivating phenomena in literature and compared it to the writings of Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian and Bruno Schulz. criticized Tokarczuk's prose as being conformist and having a quality more typical of the entertainment industry. Wojciech Browarny considered there to be a feminist element in Tokarczuk's writing, but said she should not be categorised into the group of feminist writers. praised Tokarczuk for being representative of the prose of young women. The novel was also reviewed by and Kinga Dunin. The novel was nominated for the 1997 Nike Award jury prize. It was, however, awarded their audience award for 1997. Tokarczuk was also awarded the 1996 Paszport Polityki in the literature category. She was also awarded the Ko≈õcielski Award in 1997. The novel was a success with readers in Poland and abroad, and has been translated into over twenty languages. In 2010, it was published in English as Primeval and Other Times by Twisted Spoon Press, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones. The novel was included in the official reading list of Poland's Ministry of National Education.

The journal is a collection of recollections, reflections, photographs, sketches, poems and associative ephemera from Ginsberg's journey in India with partner Peter Orlovsky between 1962 and 1963. Background Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled from Israel to India in March 1962 to explore and meet Ginsberg's friend and fellow poet Gary Snyder and partner Joanne Kyger. Despite warnings from Ginsberg's friend Peter Bowles to avoid the local food and stick to high end accommodation, Ginsberg and Orlovsky dedicated themselves to living in cheap, local accommodation and preserving as much money as possible to extend their stay and engage with local culture.Miles, Barry, Ginsberg: A Biography, Penguin Books Ltd, 1990. Ginsberg journeyed extensively across India, living for extended periods in Calcutta and Benares and engaged with spiritual gurus, local sadhus and India's many homeless. The journey also included a joint, bilingual poetry reading with Indian poets and writers, which had a lasting impact on the Indian poetry movement, though the reading itself was seen by some Indian participants as more provocative than productive.Thayil, Jeet ; Wheeler, Jo \\"Ginsberg in India\\", BBC Radio 3, 18 October 2015 The Journals Ginsberg's narrative diary entries record graphic descriptions of poverty, his frequent illnesses, his and Orlovsky's heavy and frequent use of opium, ganja and ether, as well as interactions with locals, and exchanges with friends abroad. Many passages detail Ginsberg's reflections on the nature of life and death after viewing many ghat ceremonies in Calcutta and the confronting, abject poverty. The scrapbook form of the Journals also includes newspaper clippings, lecture notes, names and addresses of contacts, many black and white photographs and poetry. Among the many poems drafted in the Journals are a death poem to Ginsberg's mentor and influence William Carlos Williams, who died while Ginsberg was in Benares, a range of work reflecting on or written while sitting beneath Howrah Bridge, and an early form of \\"Stotras to Kali Destroyer of Illusions\\". Several works from this period were later published in Planet News by City Lights Books.Vendler, Helen, \\"Allen Ginsberg Considers His Country and Himself\\", The New York Times, April 15, 1973 Many of the photographs published in Indian Journals portray the leprous beggars in the vicinity of Ginsberg and Orlovsky's hotels and pensions, candid self-portraits and portraits of sadhus, along with photographs of severed limbs of train accident victims seen in their many rail journeys. Publication and reception The first edition of Indian Journals was published in 1970, after five years of transcription, editing and compilation, with a nude photograph of Shambu Bharti Baba serving as the cover. A second paperback edition was published by Grove Press in 1996 with a scrapbook collage cover. Ginsberg's idiosyncratic spelling, punctuation, grammar and syntax were retained unaltered in both editionsGrove Atlantic, \\"Indian Journals\\", Indian Journals, ret: September 30, 2019 Indian Journals was seen by Helen Vendler in the New York Times as the record of a turning point in Ginsberg's focus, having been through a mid-life crisis from which he emerged \\"a geographer, and his one inexhaustible subject is the earth and what it looks like.\\"Vendler, Helen, \\"Allen Ginsberg Considers His Country and Himself\\", The New York Times, April 15, 1973 Raj Chandarlapaty sees the Journals \\"rich with deeply sensual associations of consciousness and transcendental signifiers suggesting the possibility of a mass cultural revolution that could redesign world ethics and man's social performativity.\\"Chandarlapaty, Raj, Indian Journals and Allen Ginsberg's Revival as Prophet of Social Revolution, ariel: a review of international english literature, Vol. 41 No. 2 Pages 113‚Äì138, 2011 Gayathri Prabhu wrote that Journals recorded a period of transcendental experience for Ginsberg as a Westerner, \\"pushing the boundaries of his tourist persona, throwing himself into the most alien and morbid and then staying immersed in it till he can glean some form of personal truth\\" and functioned as a \\"brilliant evocation of transnationalism\\". He also sees Ginsberg's journey as different from the \\"earlier Western project of 'saving' India from its squalor\\" in which \\"Ginsberg attempts to pay more attention to Indian poverty without simply condemning it\\" and called Ginsberg's depiction of poverty a \\"profound, ambivalent experience\\".Prabhu, Gayathri, \\"Figurations of the Spiritual Squalid in Allen Ginsberg's Indian Journals: Transformation of India in Post-War Beat and American Imagination.\\", Transnational Literature Vol.6 no.1,November 2013.

Life Born Grete Bernheim in Salzburg, she initially worked as a typist, bookseller, and bank clerk in Berlin. In 1928 she married the Czech-born author Franz Carl Weiskopf, a member of the German Communist Party and the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors. In 1931 she authored her first young adult novel, Ede und Unku, which was among the books destroyed during the Nazi book burnings. In 1933 she and her husband fled to Prague; in 1939 they fled via Paris to New York City. After the Second World War the couple returned to Prague for a brief period. That same year, Franz began working in the diplomatic service, which led to assignments in Washington, DC and Stockholm. From 1950 to 1952 they lived in the People's Republic of China, where she worked as a translator and journalist. From 1953 until her death she lived in East Germany. She and her husband are buried in a Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde. Career During her life in East Germany, Weiskopf wrote children's and young adult novels and short stories. Her two most successful books are Ede und Unku and The Arctic Ocean, which were both adapted into films. She was considered a pioneer of socialist children's literature. Honors * She is the namesake of a literary prize, the Alex-Wedding-Preis, awarded since 1968. * On 27 January 2011, on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Nation Socialism, a path in Friedrichshain was renamed Ede-und-Unku-Weg in memory of Weiskopf's most celebrated novel. * Since 2009 a street on Alexanderplatz between Karl-Liebknecht-, Knebel-, and Wadzeckstrasse is named Alex-Wedding-Strasse.

The songs were recorded in 1979 with producer Stu Cook, former bass player of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Some material from those sessions was also released on the 1980 CBS UK album Roky Erickson and the Aliens, later reissued as I Think of Demons. Cook played bass on two tracks, \\"Sputnik\\" and \\"Bloody Hammer.\\" The album was re-released on April 16, 2002 by Austin, Texas record label Sympathy for the Record Industry as a double-CD titled The Evil One (Plus One). The second disc is made up of a 48-minute appearance from August 20, 1979 on California radio station KSJO's The Modern Humans Show, on which Erickson plays rough mixes from the album and talks about music and horror films. Reception The album is considered by many critics to be an eccentric cult classic. Pitchfork reviewer Jason Heller called the album \\"brilliant. ... In a spasms of feral, lip-twisted fury, he snarls about demons, zombies, vampires, ghosts, and demons again with all the intensity of a rabies victim.\\" Heller noted that Erickson's interest in horror and sci-fi imagery drew comparisons with the progressive hard rock of Blue √ñyster Cult and Alice Cooper as well as punk rock. Austin Chronicle writer Scott Schinder called Erickson's 1980s albums, released after his half-decade involuntary stay in a Texas psychiatric hospital, \\"the clearest glimpse into his raging musical soul.\\" He described The Evil One as \\"the mother lode. It's the disc on which Erickson comes across most clear-eyed, and the source of many of his best-loved solo songs.\\" Billboard writer Morgan Enos said that The Evil One \\"brims over with propulsive bangers about harrowing visions. ... Every moment slams with a galvanic precision.\\" Mark Demin of AllMusic wrote that \\"The Evil One shows just how strong a rocker (Erickson) could be -- and how good a band he could put together. Great stuff, and certainly the best representation of Roky's \\"latter-day punk\\" period.\\" Rolling Stone writer Hank Shteamer called the album \\"soulful and assured,\\" noting that Erickson seemed fully at home even on the darkest material. Tony Bennett of the Duluth News Tribune noted that Erickson's personal troubles did not diminish the passion and intensity of his music, saying that \\"while his songs are unusual, indeed, the man could sing like a banshee. ... His voice possesses the traits that the greatest rock singers own. Energy, passion, good pitch, soul -- he's got it all.\\" Legacy and influence In an obituary for Erickson after his 2019 death, British music magazine Kerrang! singled out The Evil One as perhaps Erickson's most influential album, calling it \\"an important precursor to the psychobilly and horror metal genres\\" for its \\"strange, cinematic approach to psychedelia.\\" The magazine also praised \\"Night of the Vampire\\" as \\"easily the greatest vampire song in history. ... Roky paints on the vampire as he lives in the cultural subconscious, a being of film, literature, and ancient myth all at once.\\" The song \\"Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)\\" inspired the name of 1980s Los Angeles psychedelic/post-punk band Red Temple Spirits. \\"If You Have Ghosts\\" was covered by Ghost in 2013 on its covers EP If You Have Ghost.

Wake velocity may be straightened out, given contra-rotational swirl, accelerated, or a combination of these effects, all of which can improve propeller efficiency, giving either higher thrust or reducing power requirement for the same thrust. Structure The wake- equalising duct is a static flow modifier attached to the hull upstream of the propeller within the wake. It may be made of a single circular section duct directly ahead of the propeller, with fixed internal and/or external fins to impart rotational changes to the wake flow, or as two semicircular ducts mounted further forwards, one on each side of the hull, aligned to provide the desired flow modification. The duct(s) may be eccentrically mounted to include mainly the thickest part of the wake. This offset would usually be above the centre of the shaft. Function There are four components to the wake modification. #The wake is accelerated by the shape of the duct to be closer to the free-stream velocity of water over the rest of the propeller disc. #The direction of flow is aligned more closely with the free stream inflow. #A contra-rotational swirl may be induced, which will reduce outflow vorticity. #Flow separation at the afterbody may be reduced, which can reduce the thrust- deduction factor These have the effect of increasing the efficiency of the propeller as it is working in a more uniform flow, and less energy is lost to hub vortex. The more uniform inflow conditions can also significantly reduce propeller blade vibration. Fuel savings of up to 12% have been claimed. The system has the greatest benefit on hulls where the inflow conditions are inherently more disturbed. Versions The Becker Mewis Duct is a version based on an eccentric annular nozzle fitted between the hull and the propeller, supported by a number of flow directing radial vanes, each of which is angled to optimise inflow direction. The design is patented and has been in use since 2009. The Schneekluth Wake Equalising Duct is a version using two semicircular nozzles, one on each side of the hull, centred above the shaft centreline, and angled to provide contra-rotational outflow swirl.

An army veteran of the Chinese Civil War, he trained to become a submariner in the 1960s and commanded China's first submarine mission to sail past the first island chain into the Pacific Ocean in 1976. He served as Commander of the L√ºshun Naval Base from 1983 to 1985 and as Commander of the PLA Navy from 1988 to 1996.  Early life and army career  Zhang was born on 23 June 1931 in Xiaogao Village, Jiaozhou, Shandong, Republic of China. He enlisted in the People's Liberation Army in March 1947 and fought in major battles of the Chinese Civil War, including the Battle of Jiaodong, the Battle of Jinan, the Huaihai campaign, the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, the Shanghai Campaign, and the Battle of Zhangzhou‚ÄìXiamen. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Zhang served in the 31st Group Army as a platoon and company commander. Following two years of study at the Advanced Infantry School from 1956 to 1958, he served as a battalion chief of staff in the Fuzhou Military Region.  Career in the Navy  In August 1960, Zhang entered the PLA Navy Submarine Academy in Qingdao. Upon graduation in 1965, he served as a submarine captain and later commander of a submarine detachment. In 1976, China for the first time sent a submarine (No. 252) to sail past the first island chain into the Pacific Ocean, for a total journey of 3,300 nautical miles. Zhang served as the commander of the mission. From 1979 to 1980, Zhang studied at the PLA Military Academy (now PLA National Defence University), and subsequently served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the North Sea Fleet and Commander of the L√ºshun Naval Base. In September 1983, Zhang received North Korean President Kim Il-sung on the latter's visit of the L√ºshun Base, who was accompanied by General Secretary Hu Yaobang. =Commander of the Navy = In early 1985, Zhang was promoted to Deputy Commander of the PLA Navy, in charge of logistics and equipment. He was elected an alternate member of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in November 1987. Although the most junior among the navy's deputy commanders, Zhang was chosen by Deng Xiaoping and Liu Huaqing to succeed Liu as the 4th Commander of the PLA Navy in January 1988. He was the first commander of the navy to have served at sea, whereas his predecessors were all veteran revolutionaries of the Long March era. He attained the rank of vice admiral in September 1988 and admiral in May 1993. He was elected a full member of the 14th Central Committee in 1992. Zhang put a strong emphasis on maritime defence. In an interview in 1988, he said that \\"We will never forget that China was invaded several times by imperialist troops from the sea. The nation's suffering from lack of sea defence still remains fresh in our mind; and the history should not repeat itself.\\" He served for more than eight years as the PLAN commander until November 1996, when he was succeeded by naval aviator Shi Yunsheng. According to James R. Lilley and David Shambaugh, Zhang was \\"respected\\" in the navy.

Career  Born in Yangsan, Gyeongnam, 1968. Namgang High School graduated from the Department of Political Science and Diplomacy at Korea University in 1991, while serving as Lt. Lieutenant in the 9th Division White Horse Troops during the ROTC 29th. The official requested the soldiers to shoot the candidate and accused the election of fraudulent elections that the public vote had been committed through a press conference (March 22, 1992). After being arrested and arrested for second- class soldiers, after three years of court quarrels, the dismissal was canceled and Lee was able to move to lieutenant. However, after being hired by the Samsung Group, he decided to take a leave of absence during his military service and to work after the war. Was rejected, and after the recommendation of reinstatement by the Democratization Committee, he was denied reinstatement and refused to return to the Samsung Group. In the wake of Lee's revelation, absentee ballots in the military were improved to out-of-office voting, which began in the same year as presidential elections, helping to block the election of illegal elections. Since then, Lee has been in political affairs for a while, and has been elected as the youngest member of the Seoul Metropolitan Government as a Democratic Party. Since the end of the city council, he has worked as an anti-corruption civil society activist at gatherings with the public interest reporter, the Whistle Foundation, the Heungsadan Transparent Social Movement Headquarters, and the Press Center for Human Rights. He is the only lottery democracy in Korea to elect members of parliament and local councils through lottery instead of elections. As of 2018, he is the general manager of the Korea Integrity Movement Headquarters, a permanent representative of the Internal Reporting Practice Movement, a research professor at Yonsei University, and a member of the government's Integrity Society and Public Relations Council. For his anti-corruption merit, he won the National Package, Presidential Commendation, and the Citizen's Award. Related to the Democratic Movement he was recognized by the Honorary Recovery and Compensation Review Committee as a democratic movement related person.

The transactions are handled through a mobile application. Unlike an automated convenience store, the unmanned store concept relies on smartphone-related technologies and artificial intelligence to remove the traditional features of a store.  History  = First developments = In 2012, the Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group published a paper on the unmanned store possibilities enabled by the recent rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets. In 2014, the company ShelfX developed the first version of unmanned stores. Customers could swipe their cards on their phones to pay in the store and go without checking out at the cashier. In February 2016, the first unmanned store of Sweden opened in Viken. = US-China race = In December 2016, Amazon announced the launch of unmanned store \\"Amazon Go\\" and began research and development. Until January 22, 2018, it officially opened in Seattle, USA, and opened up general consumer experience and purchase. On May 7, 2019, Amazon announced that it will open its first unmanned store, Amazon Go, in New York, USA. The address is located on the second floor of Brookfield Plaza Shopping Center in New York City. While Amazon first announced the release of unmanned stores in the USA, China started to compete with the USA in the adoption and growth of domestic unmanned stores. Taobao launched the \\"Tao Coffee\\" pop-up unmanned store in Hangzhou in July 2017. Alibaba opened an unmanned experience store in January 2018. Other Chinese retail giants such as Jingdong and WeChat also opened unmanned flash Stores. Japan's Lawson announced in December 2017 that it will introduce unmanned stores this year. The Signature concept store in South Korea opened on May 16th on the 31st floor of Lotte World Tower, the tallest building in Seoul. On January 29, 2018, Taiwan also launched 7-11's first unmanned store X-STORE. By 2017, an estimated 200 unmanned stores had opened in China. = Rapid decline = As soon as 2018, the unmanned store bubble started to pop in China, with many stores closing and facing bankruptcy. The online retailer JD.com had announced 5,000 virtual shelves in July 2018, but retracted from this engagement 6 months later. One reason for the rapid downfall of unmanned stores is the failure of the pioneering stores to create an authentic \\"just-walk-out\\" experience, which killed the convenience of shopping there. While the focus was on technology, many stores neglected the customer experience aspect of their shops.  Description  Unmanned stores are completely self-serve and self-checkout, and there are no waiting lines at the cashier. The registering of bought products and their payments are done with a mobile application. The ceiling of the entire store is equipped with artificial intelligence camera system and machine algorithms. From the moment the customer enters the store, the camera will record the customer's moving route, browse the product, take, view the label or return the product. Wait for the action, and then send the image to the machine for image recognition. As long as the customer picks up a certain item, it will automatically be added to the virtual shopping cart in the APP. If the customer does not want to purchase the product and put it back on the shelf, the virtual shopping cart in the APP will also be automatically deleted. In the end, when customers choose their products, they do n‚Äôt have to wait in line for checkout. Because there is no checkout counter in the store, customers just need to walk directly out of the door of the store.

History The nave, aisles and chancel from the west end The church is medieval, but much was rebuilt in the late 15th century. A restoration was undertaken in 1868-69 under the supervision of Mr. H. Elliott, architect of Plymouth. The west end gallery was removed. The roof was restored. The old pews were replaced with new pews of oak. The medieval bench ends were preserved where possible and new ones carved in a similar style. The walls were plastered, and the windows were re-glazed with plain cathedral glass. A stained glass window by Heaton and Butler was installed at the east end with a representation of the Good Shepherd. The church reopened for worship on Thursday 8 July 1869. The church is noted for the monuments in the Drake aisle. Those to George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield of 1795 and Sir Francis Henry Drake, 5th Baronet of 1794 are by John Bacon Senior. The memorial to Francis Augustus Eliott, 2nd Baron Heathfield is by John Bacon Junior and the memorial to Dame Eleanor Elliott Drake (d. 1841) is by Richard Westmacott. =Rectors= Organ The organ The organ was installed by H.P. Dicker of Exeter in 1849. It was playable either by a person on the keyboard, or by a barrel. It was the gift of Sir Thomas Fuller-Eliott-Drake, Bart. It was expanded in 1920 by Hele & Co of Plymouth when a second manual was added. Subsequent rebuildings and enlargements have resulted in a 2 manual organ with 24 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. Bells The tower contains a peal of 8 bells.

A few ‚Äì but often ruined- buildings are also on the territory of today's Bangladesh.

Natural stone deposits are almost unknown, and so the residential houses in the countryside until well into the 20th century were. Century almost exclusively ‚Äì sometimes mud- plastered Branches, or (more rarely) from air-dried clay bricks and the roofs were made of straw or reeds. At an early age, Bengal also understood the burning of clay, so that the temple buildings of the 5th/6th century (or the hard-to-date Deul temples) were built of bricks. At the temples of the 17th to 19th century, figurative and decorative terracotta relief plates were regularly applied. Most of the city houses were built in this period also from bricks and then plastered. Consecration Although early Buddhist and Jainist traces are also found in Bengal, most temples are dedicated to Hindu deities Shiva, Vishnu and Kali, or their locally and regionally revered aspects, which is why many temples have different names. Also the God Krishna and his beloved Radha enjoy in Bengal wide popularity. History The oldest known temple of Bengal, belonging to the group of the so-called Gupta temples, is the brick temple (mandir) of Balgram (Dinajpur district, Bangladesh), which can be attributed to the Vaishnava sect-but only remains of ruins are preserved. At the same time, the two ‚Äì also largely destroyed ‚Äì temples of Mahasthan Gokul (District of Bogra, Bangladesh), which are most likely to be attributed to Buddhism due to the remains of found figures. Both temples have a square floor plan with an equally square Cella (garbhagriha), which was enclosed by a prostrate dormant and formerly covered handling (pradakshinapatha). Perhaps from the 9th to the 11th century, but perhaps only much later, several temple buildings were built in the south of West Bengal, which are clearly influenced by the architecture of Odisha ‚Äì perhaps the most significant of them are the tower-like temples (deul) of Satdeulia and Raidighi (Jatar Deul), but also the Ichai Ghosh Temple is remarkable. After the arrival of Islam in northern India, which was regarded as 'Pagan' and 'idolatrous' Hinduism, many older temples were destroyed and hardly any new buildings were built.Michell, 156 In the early 17th century, however, the attitude of the Mogul ruler Jahangir (reg. 1605-1627), as well as political and military weaknesses of the Mughal Empire and the great distance to the courts of Lahore, Agra or Aurangabad exploitative ‚Äì reinforced with the construction of temples, which represent within the Hindu temple, a completely unique architectural type. Here, the temples in Bishnupur, the ancient capital of the Malla dynasty, as well as the temple districts of Antpur and Kalna, are to be mentioned in the forefront, but also the temple complex of Puthia, Bangladesh, deserve special mention. Architecture Bishnupur ‚Äì Radhamadhab- Temple (1739) Bishnupur ‚Äì Rasmancha-Temple (1600) Early temples of the 16th century have rarely been preserved; they consisted only of a Cella (garbhagriha) with a square layout (see Puthia Temple Complex). Characteristic features of the later temples of Bengal type are the maintenance of the square floor plan-but now with a stronger internal and external structure-and the arched vaulted roofs with their hanging corners (Bengal roofs). All the temples now stand on two to almost five-Meter high platforms (jagatis), which derive the rainwater from the structure and raise it at the same time real as symbolically over other buildings. Behind the four (mostly three ‚Äì way) portals, which are based on a triumphal arch scheme, is the also square Cella (garbhagriha), which is surrounded by a completely integrated into the temple building (pradakshinapatha). The roof is usually elevated by one (Ek-ratna) or five (pancharatna) usually round Tambour-like towers, which differ in their shape significantly from the tower-like structures (shikharas) of North Indian temples of Nagara style. From 17. to 19. In the 19th century, nine-to thirteen-Tower Temple buildings were built, but also a few with flat roofs.3.http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/wb/wbtemps.htm In contrast, the towerless Rasmancha temple in Bishnupur, which was built around 1600, offers a very unusual architecture: the massive square structure, which occupies about four times the base of a normal Bengal temple, is overestimated by a pyramid- like structure. On the other hand, the roof of the exterior, which is open on each side by ten arcades, consists of a number of smaller, stacked roofs of the Bengal type. Bengal temples are also characterised by the complete absence of mandapas, jalis or balconies; jewelry such as amalakas and kalashas are also rare. There are also Toranas (Toranas), which, however, have the appearance of smaller buildings. Chota Shiva Temple, Puthia.jpgPuthia (Bangladesh) ‚Äì Jagannatha-Temple (16. Jh.)

In his artistic career, Zhang has received the Asian Cultural Council Fellowship, as well as two Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grants, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, and more. He has participated in the International Curatorial Program at MoMA in New York. As one of the representative artists for the earliest abstract art in China, Zhang began pursuing abstract painting in the early 1980s. He pioneered the use os materials such as sand, rock, pottery directly in painting in China. In September 2019, Zhang had a two-month residency at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, as the fourth artist taking part in the three-year artist-in- residence programme co-presented with K11 Art Foundation. The residency involved the creation of a new mixed-media installation work titled Human Traces. The work was exhibited at Zhang‚Äôs solo show of the same name at his studio in the Smirke 2 Studio of RA Schools, from 5 September to 14 September 2019.  Artistic practice  Over the course of forty years, Zhang has created works in various mediums, from photography, ink installation, video, performances to painting. From the 1990s onward, Zhang began to abandon the pre-existing style and started to further turn his focus to conceptual art, emphasizing the practice of installation and performance, including his 1994 outdoor performance To Fuse, executed at Djerassi Sculpture Park, California. Zhang began to frequently visit Shanghai after 2000, and his practice also evolved with an emphasis on his Chinese heritage. Much of Zhang‚Äôs work tries to explore the complicated relationships between different cultures, essentially between traditional Chinese and contemporary culture.  Museum collections  Zhang‚Äôs works are included in the institutional collections of the Brooklyn Museum, New York; Asian Art Museum, San Francisco; The Djerassi Sculpture Park, California; M+ Museum, Hong Kong; Guangdong Museum of Art, China; Shanghai Art Museum, China; Yuz Museum Shanghai, Shanghai.

The book deals with the topic of the scarcity in the economy by looking at it in reverse. The author describes the 24th-century Star Trek universe in which scarcity does not exist at all. The book explores a post- scarcity age where it questions if we as humans are equipped for the events happening in that age. It looks at the expectations regarding automation and artificial intelligence and takes readers through a journey of the fictional, moneyless world of Star Trek. It also looks at the challenges to the Star Trek economy. In 2017 the narrated version of Trekonomics was nominated for an Audie Award and came out as a finalist. Summary Societies are working under scarcity, so half of the people in the world are living under scarcity. Robots are coming closer. We must think about how to deal with this technological change. In the future, we will not worry about money. We may not work to earn money in the future, so we can escape from the fear of scarcity. Instead of that, we will work hard to get a good reputation from people. In this world scientists are the most important and famous persons and everyone would be working for them. Star Trek is this form of society. Saadia analysed the economics of Star Trek. He explored the underlying economic theory beyond the market supply and demand. He asks the readers \\"What would the world look like if everyone had everything they wanted or needed?\\" The author argues that while a warp drive may not be possible, post-scarcity economy is much more realistic. Structure The first chapter focuses on the Star Trek universe (primarily, the United Federation of Planets, or Federation for short) and the absence of currency in it. In a society where the economic problems have been overcome, money is meaningless. It explains how that nation functions without the pricing mechanism and the results of eliminating money as both a unit of account and as an information signal. The status of human labor in the Star Trek universe is the topic of the second chapter. The Star Trek universe is a utopia because people do not have to work, but yet the ones we see on the show are all paradoxically very busy. The motivations of people who chose to work are analyzed. The third chapter talks about the replicator, the machine that makes Star Trek post-scarcity possible. Post-scarcity's meaning is the infinite social wealth. The replicator is as a metaphor for automation, and an endpoint of the industrial revolution. Crucially, in the Star Trek society it and its produces are public good. The fourth chapter focuses on natural limits of growth. In particular, it deals with the issue of whether resources are indeed limited, and how can different societies coexist if some view resources as limited and others, like the Federation, much less so. It also tackles examples to examine that Star Trek universe follows the economic theory. The fifth chapter is focused on negative externalities, such as whether different alien species (and their governments) can manage common resources. This chapter analyses the Star Trek-themed prisoner's dilemma game, and discusses whether rational and well-governed societies, like the idealistic and utopian Federation, can react appropriately when faced with an uncooperative foreign power. This chapter considers the theories of Elinor Ostrom who discusses methods of solving similar scenarios by using mutually beneficial collective action. A simple history of Star Trek and Trekonomics is introduced in the sixth chapter. The seventh chapter explains human behavior and nature. Some Star Trek characters such as Spock and Captain Picard are completely different from 21st century humans. They live freely from the economic necessity, so they devote their lives to science and justice. The chapter highlights how economic behaviours and psychology change under the post-scarcity. The eighth chapter deals with the Ferengis, an economically powerful alien species in the Star Trek universe, with an economy based on trade and capitalism. They are profit seekers, and all profit seekers can change. Deep Space 9, the third show, tells about how the Ferengis abandon their old ways and evolve into Keynesian social democrats. The final chapter reveals how the Star Trek society already exists in some local and unevenly distributed forms. The expanding world prosperity, combined with the spread of public goods on a global scale, and the rise of \\"free\\" stuff makes society approach ever closer to Trekonomics, the challenge being mainly distributional rather than technological. Characters *The Federation: These characters are completely different from 20th century humans when it comes to a conventional way of living. The post-scarcity age has influenced them in a way where they are nothing like us. Being untroubled by belongings makes them have no interest in conspicuous consumption. They are most likely interested in things of a much higher nature such as the cultivation of the mind, education, love, art and, of course, discovery. *The Ferengi: These are imaginary extraterrestrial species that as only other species charge money for the use of certain products, specifically replicators. They are a parody of the 1990s or 2000s American acquisitive businessman. The Ferengi are viewed as the lowest of the society and seen as awful but funny at the same time. The Ferengi do change over time, due to contact by the federation, they start to look more like the federation and eventually become Keynesian social democrats. Saadia thinks that the Ferengi becoming more humanitarian is a metaphor for us becoming better by watching Star Trek. *The Borg: This is one of the most powerful extraterrestrial species. The Borg are one of the most efficient species in the Star Trek series and look a lot like the Federation. They have perfect allocation of goods, a perfect assignment to supply and demand. This is one of the other societies that could be viewed as a post-scarcity economy. Every Borg drone has no needs or wants for anything; everything is provided by the collective of beings. Saaida thinks the Borg are a mirror image to what a society could look like and thinks the writers of Star Trek tried to incorporate criticism of the society they present. Critical reception Johann K. Jaeckel writes that Trekonomics presents an unconventional contribution to the long-standing concern in economic thought regarding the impact of continuous automation on the role of human labor in social reproduction. a New York Times review stated that Trekonomics can help us understand what it would take to create such a world as in Star Trek where technological advances would allow the whole society to lead more comfortable and meaningful lives, rather than the inequality that exists now which enriches only a few lucky people. A Washington Post review notes that the book goes deep into the better understanding of our economy and society without scarcity. Through that we can better understand how the society works under scarcity. Due to the depiction of the Star Trek universe, Roeder asserts that the book has shortcomings such as the assignment of property rights, and a dedicated price system for energy and encouragement of services, which fosters rivalry. This makes it controversial to explore a post-scarcity world. Writing for Forbes, Worstall observes that the book explores the economy of Star Trek with a strong resemblance to the economy we know today except there being no scarcity. This economy could never exist, but if it would, then it would look more like the one that Karl Marx discussed ‚Äì communism. Therefore Worstall concludes that the economy of Star Trek is simply true communism.

Johannes also completed an apprenticeship as a saddler, and he became interested in trade unionism, founding a branch of the Saddlers' Union in Cologne in 1889. In 1890, he joined the Social Democratic Party, and in 1891, he was elected as chair of the Saddlers' Union, also serving as editor of its journal. To take up his union posts, Sassenbach moved to Berlin. There, he co-founded a co-operative of military saddlers, and served as its manager. In 1895, he organised the first conference of socialist academics, founding the Sozialistischer Akademiker journal, and editing it for a year, then editing Neuland until 1898. He also co-founded and managed a trade union house in Berlin. In 1903, the International Federation of Saddlers' Unions was created, and Sassenbach served as its general secretary. In 1902, Sassenbach was elected to the executive of the General Commission of German Trade Unions, serving until 1922.

He specialized in the sociology of the family. He was the seventh president of the International Sociological Association (1970‚Äì1974). He has been called \\"the founding father of family sociology\\". Biography Hill was born on July 4, 1912 in Utah. In his youth he served as a missionary in Europe for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After his mission he was not involved in that Church in any meaningful participatory way.Dollahite, et. al, \\"Family Studied\\", Mormon Studied Review, 2017 He received his PhD in 1938 from the University of Wisconsin. He later taught at the University of South Dakota (1942‚Äì1945), Iowa State University (1945-1949), University of North Carolina (1949‚Äì1957) and University of Minnesota (1957‚Äì1983). At Minnesota, he held the title of the Regents‚Äô Professor of family sociology from 1973. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Puerto Rico (1953‚Äì1954), University of Louvain (1961‚Äì1962) and others. He retired in 1983 as an emeritus professor. Hill died in Norway on September 26, 1985. Research and impact Hill specialized in the sociology of the family. He was influenced by works of Ernest W. Burgess, Evelyn Duvall, Howard Becker, Clifford Kirkpatrick, and Willard W. Waller. Through his career he authored 20 books and over 150 articles and gave lectures in over 40 countries. Bert N. Adams described him as \\"one of the leading scholars in the field of marriage and the family\\". David H. Olson and Pauline Boss went even further, noting that Hill \\"was considered the founding father of family sociology\\". He was one of the first sociologists in the United States specializing in studying family and marriage. John Mogey noted that one of his early books, When you marry (1945) a textbook on sociology of family, \\"set a national standard for functional courses in family life education\\" for many years. The Reuben Hill Research Award, given annually in his name by National Council on Family Relations (NCFR), was established in 1980 and is awarded for the best research or theory paper in the field of family sociology. Wesley R. Burr described Hill's contribution as follows: > [D]eveloping a model to study family crises, conducting theory-based field > experiments, organising the first bibliographic storage system in the field, > developing the methodology to study three generations of families > simultaneously, initiating graduate traineeships in the family field, > helping to develop the family development conceptual framework, developing > methods to improve theory, dramatically improving theory, and helping to > establish the Theory and Method workshops that are held in conjunction with > the annual meetings of the National Council on Family Relations. Olson and Boss mention that Hill's \\"ABC-X model describing family stress [presented in 1958] has had an immense impact on the field\\".  Awards  He received, among others, the first Ernest W.

His shops and printing house operated from 1760-1799, later with his son Anthony Torr√©, as Torre & Co. (or variously also as Torr√©s or occasionally as Torri). Family business Giovanni Battista (also known as Giambattista) Torre initially worked as a pyrotechnician, manufacturing fireworks. He worked in London in 1753. In 1760, he opened a shop called \\"Cabinet de Physique Exp√©rimentale\\", selling books, prints, barometers and other scientific instruments, on the rue St. Honor√© in Paris. His son Anthony (with another son whose name is given only as \\"L. Torre\\") moved to London and opened a shop in Market Lane, also selling prints and scientific instruments.Trading as: \\"Anthony Torre & Brother, Printsellers, the Golden Head, Market Lane, Pall Mall.\\", Reproduced from trade card in Banks Collection (D,2.3383), Heal Collection,100.79. This London business was in operation by 1767, in partnership with another Italian immigrant, Anthony Molteno. A \\"fire worker\\" named Mr. Torr√© is also recorded as operating at Marylebone Gardens, London, between 1772 and 1774.J.S.Smith & W.Whitten (1905). A book for a rainy day, or, Recollections of the events of the years 1766-1833. London : Methuen & Co. pp.62-63. Legacy After Giovanni B. Torre died in 1780, Anthony della Torre involved several other partners, before the business eventually became the current Colnaghi Gallery. For the Paris branch, Anthony first partnered with Charles Ciceri (1780-1782), before Ciceri opened his own business and L.Torre took over the original shop, now moved to Porte St. Antoine, near the Bastille. The Paris business seems to have relied extensively on connections to other art dealers from the Italian expatriate community, across the continent, such as Joseph Zanna (Brussels) and Sebastiano Tessari (Augsburg). In 1784 Anthony hired the new Milanese immigrant, Paul Colnaghi, on Ciceri's recommendation, to run a new shop situated in Palais Royal. The next year however, Colnaghi handed over the Paris shop to Pascal Noseda, and moved to London to join Anthony Torre and Anthony Molteno as a third partner there in 1785. They then moved to 132 Pall Mall in 1786. Anthony Torre retired back to Milan in 1788, and after the business operated for a time as Molteno, Colnaghi & Co., Anthony Molteno also left in 1793. Although a \\"Torre & Dechessa\\", seems to have operated briefly from 50 Market Lane, according to the London Director (1790-93), the business was continued from then on by Paul Colnaghi and his successors.Giovanni Battista Torre - Biography References Category:Companies established in 1760 Category:English art dealers ","title":"Giovanni Battista Torre"},{"id":"61922502","text":"Jan Oudegeest (5 August 1870 - 10 October 1950) was a Dutch trade unionist and politician. Born in Utrecht, Oudegeest worked on the railways and in 1898 was a founder of the Netherlands Association of Railway and Tramway Employees (NV), soon becoming the union's chair. In this role, he led a major strike in 1903, but thereafter decided to avoid strike action. When the Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen was founded in 1906, he became its first secretary, then in 1909, he took over as its president, serving until 1919. In this role, he was highly critical of the Christian trade unions, believing them to be pro-capitalist. Oudegeest was a founder member of the International Labour Organization, and was vice-chair of its administrative council for many years, in which post he unsuccessfully tried to bring the social democratic and Marxist internationals together. Oudegeest served on the council of Utrecht, and later that of Amsterdam, before in 1918 winning election to the House of Representatives. In 1919, he was a prominent founder of the International Federation of Trade Unions, and served as joint secretary until 1927. That year, he stood down, becoming chair of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, and in 1928 he was also elected to the Senate. He retired from his party post in 1934, and from the Senate in 1936, but remained on the executive of the NV until 1942.
