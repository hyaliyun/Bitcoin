Sizes ranges from up to in diameter, with the most popular gazing ball being . Gazing balls were glass but can now be stainless steel, acrylic, ceramic, or stained glass. Unlike hanging friendship balls or witch balls that have a loop, gazing balls come in a variety, with some having a stem so they can securely sit in a stand, while others are more uniform in shape and can sit on grass. Larger sizes can be made but prove difficult to place on the stand due to the weight of the globe. Breda, Netherlands History Gazing balls originated in 13th century Venice, Italy, where they were hand-blown by skilled craftsmen. King Ludwig II of Bavaria, sometimes referred to as Mad King Ludwig, is said to have adorned his Herrenchiemsee palace with lawn balls, however, the palace and gardens were never finished after Ludwig died in 1885. Sometime later the gardens, based on Versailles, were open to the public and visitors may have seen the lawn balls, but the Victorian period was quickly coming to an end. By the 1880s and 90s the nature of English landscape was changing dramatically with William Robinson's and Gertrude Jekyll's designs. It would be difficult to say that Mad King Ludwig had much influence in the area of garden ornaments. Gazing balls enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity in the 1930s. They appear in a number of modernistic gardens of the period as a variation on the traditional sundial or birdbath centrepiece. Many of them from this period may have been made in polished metal rather than glass. Their popularity was probably influenced by the illuminated glass globe which was the central focal point of the modernist garden shown at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris, in 1925. The \\"Jardin d‚ÄôEau et de Lumi√®re\\" was triangular in shape, largely consisting of tiered triangular reflecting pools and planting beds. At the center of the ensemble was an electrically propelled and internally illuminated sphere of stained glass. \\"The mirror globe turning slowly to reflect lights is rather a night-club trick than a serious attempt at garden decoration. But it is completely successful in focusing the interest and relieving, by its unexpected location, what would otherwise be an altogether stiff pattern.\\" Other modernist garden designs followed, using plain metal or glass mirror globes; notable examples included several roof top gardens developed by Department Stores in London, America and Australia. The gazing ball suited the geometric clean lines of the Art Deco style especially the visual connection with the chrome plating which was part of the Streamline-moderne aesthetic of the 1930s and 1940s ‚Äì so much so in fact that they became identified in many people's minds as an invention of the 1930s. Subsequently, many people in the 1950s and afterwards viewed them as a bit tacky; an example of prosaic suburban taste of the interwar period on a level with garden gnomes ‚Äì they have never quite regained status.

They were styled by the French industrial designer Paul Arzens. The Class 1600 was ordered in 1978, after several types of locomotives were tested in the 1970s. One of those was the SNCF BB 7200, on which the 1600 is based. The 58 locomotives were delivered between 1981 and 1983. As a result of their delivery, the old Class 1000 and Class 1500 units were taken out of service. Thanks to the electronic power control, these locomotives were not only the most economical but also the most powerful locomotives that Dutch Railways had. NS/Railion Class 1600 In 1999 the freight division of NS, NS Cargo, was sold to Deutsche Bahn became part of Railion as Railion Nederland. The locomotives that became the property of Railion kept their old number (1601‚Äì1637). No. 1637 was repainted red as an advertisement for the Dutch brewery Heineken and was repainted in NS Yellow in 2004. Currently, Railion Nederland is looking to replace the Class 1600 locomotives with new multi- current locomotives type BR 189 from Germany. In early 2008 these started running into the Netherlands from Germany. NS Class 1800 The locomotives that went to NS-Reizigers (1638‚Äì1658) had their numbers raised by 200, thus keeping their number but now in the 1800 series. In later years 10 more of the 1600 locomotives were sold to NS-Reizigers and subsequently renumbered to the 1800 series. The 1800 series was now 1823, 1824 and 1826 to 1858.

Although the name implies a focus on the Apple , its coverage encompasses all Apple II systems. It is the longest-running Apple II publication and, since 1999, the only Apple II publication still in print . The 20-page magazine/newsletter (with the occasional 24- or 28-page special edition) is published quarterly and is mailed to subscribers around the world. Each issue covers the latest Apple II news including new products and event coverage. There are also frequent product reviews, how-to articles, and technical articles covering programming and even hardware design. Each year's third issue features a cover photo of the staff, taken at KansasFest, and includes extensive coverage of the premiere annual Apple II event. The publication is available as subscription-only, delivered to subscribers via postal mail, though free sample issues are available on the magazine's web site. Juiced.GS subscriptions are annual, currently costing US $20 per calendar year in the United States, $25 in Canada and Mexico and $28 elsewhere in the world. Its 25th annual volume is being published in 2020. The Juiced.GS domain name could be considered a domain hack. History Juiced.GS was founded in 1996 by Max Jones, a senior newspaper editor and devout Apple II enthusiast. What mainly sparked the idea and incentive for creating Juiced.GS was the (then) recent demise of one of the few remaining Apple II printed publications at the time, GS+ Magazine, and he wanted to fill the void. He knew that the Apple was a very capable machine, and wanted to push its limits by publishing a professional grade publication with it. The name \\"Juiced.GS\\" is derived from one of Max's friends, who upon seeing Max and knowing of his decked out Apple system, loaded with peripherals, exclaimed \\"There's the guy with the juiced GS!\\" In 2002, Syndicomm, the founding company of Apple II online resource A2Central, took over the publication while retaining the original staff of writers. Max Jones became (and remains as) editor emeritus, while Ryan Suenaga became editor. In 2006, Suenaga moved on to other endeavors, promoting then- associate editor Ken Gagne to the position of editor-in-chief, beginning with Juiced.GS's 11th annual volume. At KansasFest 2007, Gagne and Shepherd jointly announced that Gagne would take over publishing duties as well, effective immediately.

Biography Geoffroy fought in the Hundred Years War; he was at the siege of Aguillon in 1346 and was in the war as late as 1383. His name again appears in a military muster in 1363. He married Jeanne de Roug√©, younger daughter of Bonabes de Roug√©, sieur of Derval, vicomte de La Guerche, and chamberlain to the king. In 1378, as a \\"knight banneret\\", he sent a contingent of men to join the siege of Cherbourg, but he did not serve in person. In 1380 Geoffroy was fighting in Brittany, and was last mentioned in 1383. He made a second marriage with Marguerite des Roches, dame de La Mothe de Pendu, the widow of Jean de Clerembault, knight. Work \\"Geoffroy de la Tour Landry offering his book to his daughter\\", woodcut of Albrecht D√ºrer, from the German adaptation, Der Ritter vom Turn, Basel, Michael Furter, 1493 Geoffrey compiled the Livre pour l'enseignement de ses filles for the instruction of his daughters, in 1371‚Äì1372. A similar book he had previously written for his sons, according to his opening text, has disappeared. The work became the most popular educational treatise of the Late Middle Ages. It was translated into German, as Der Ritter vom Turn, and at least twice into English, once by William Caxton, who printed it as The Book of the Knight of the Tower in 1483. A Dutch adaptation, titled Dƒì spiegel der duecht, appeared in 1515 by the Brussels printer Thomas van der Noot. The Livre pour l'enseignement de ses filles served as a tutorial for De la Tour Landry's daughters on proper behaviour when visiting the royal court, which, the knight warns, is filled with smooth-talking courtiers who could potentially disgrace them and embarrass the family. The author was a widower, and concerned for his daughters' welfare. He takes a strong moral stance against the behaviour of his peers and warns his daughters about the dangers of vanity. Family Landricus Dunesis is the name of the first known member of the De La Tour Landry family; his name appears in a charter dated from c. 1061. He built a tower and fortress that were destroyed at the end of the eleventh century. The site of the subsequently rebuilt castle still stands in the canton of Chemill√©, Maine-et-Loire. De la Tour Landry's grandfather, Geoffroy III de la Tour Landry, had married Olive de Belleville, the daughter of a neighboring grand seigneur. She is mentioned in the Livre as enjoying the company of minstrels, and lauded for her generosity and piety. In the fifteenth century, Pontus de la Tour Landry commissioned the romance of Pontus et la belle Sidonie, glamorizing the family's origins in the train of Pontus, the son of the king of Galicia who fell in love with the fair Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany, where part of the ancestral possessions of the lords of La Tour lay.

The very first rehearsal was set for September, and the first concert was planned for that winter at Mission San Jose High School. The musicians received no compensation at the time, and merely played for the love of music. And play they did, with verve, skill, and the determination to mold a new sound in the community. And the people of Fremont responded by attending the concerts and supporting this new orchestra they could call their own. In 1970 the name was changed to the Fremont-Newark Philharmonic to better reflect the orchestra's membership and audience base. Following its modest beginnings, when musicians had to pay one dollar to join, the Philharmonic grew and matured impressively both in quality and in numbers. Music Director Eugene Stoia was succeeded by William Galbraith and Jason Klein, and the orchestra's sound also improved as a few professional musicians were hired to fill strategic positions. David Sloss was chosen as Music Director in 1980, and by 1983 all musicians were paid and the caliber of musicians gradually upgraded to a fully professional organization. In 1994 the Philharmonic adopted the name \\"Fremont Symphony Orchestra,\\" and performed exclusively at the Gary Soren Smith Center for the Fine and Performing Arts at Ohlone College for the next twenty seasons. In 2012, Gregory Van Sudmeier succeeded David Sloss as Music Director. In 2014 Sudemeier announced his decision to move to across the country, but offered to continue conducting if needed. In January 2015, the Board of Directors announced the decision to launch a guest conductor series beginning with former Music Director Jason Klein, who conducted a romantic concert on Valentine's Day followed by Michael Morgan, Jung-ho Pak and Dawn Harms in subsequent concerts. In May 2016, the Fremont Symphony performed a special concert led by Michael Morgan and introducing three gifted young conductors‚ÄîMatilda Hofman, Andrew Whitfield and Tyler Catlin. In the 2016-17 season, guest conductors include former Music Director David Sloss, Dawn Harms and John Farrer. In 2014, Prince of Peace Lutheran Church was introduced as an alternate performance venue in addition to the Smith Center at Ohlone College. The Fremont Symphony Orchestra is a nonprofit organization and member of the American Symphony Orchestra League (ASOL) and the Association of California Symphony Orchestras (ACSO). Performances The orchestra provides a subscription concert series featuring four or five performances of classical symphonic music each season, in addition to numerous educational performances and programs for children. The orchestra's Young Artist Competition has launched the careers of many young musicians who later rose to international stardom, most notably Aileen Chanco, Natasha Paremski and Chloe Pang. In 2005, the Fremont Symphony Orchestra performed Fremont's first full-length ballet production, Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, choreographed by the acclaimed Yoko Young. The orchestra currently performs at the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church and at the Gary Soren Smith Center for the Fine and Performing Arts of Ohlone College.

It is a paperless, computer-based system, which serves as an aid to civilian air traffic controllers. It does not control aircraft, but gives the user a display of information about an aircraft's position and associated information. It also handles communications and other information exchanges. The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System, or TAAATS is one of two systems in Australia, the other being the Australian Defence Air Traffic System (ADATS), which is used by the military. TAAATS makes use of the Thales Eurocat system and is used in two FIRs, Melbourne and Brisbane. It is also used in Terminal Control Units (TCUs) in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney. It was developed and implemented in the late 1990s and commissioned in March 2000. The introduction of TAAATS increased controllers' productivity. The system is being replaced by OneSky which will be the first integrated civil- military air traffic management system for any country. OneSKY is expected to be operational by 2021. The TAAATS console There are several facilities which use TAAATS in Australia. The two main area control centres in Brisbane and Melbourne both have roughly 42 operational consoles or \\"suites\\" and each suite has four computer screens: *Air Situation Display (ASD): This main screen displays a map of the sector that shows the location of all aircraft in the controller's airspace, as reported by one of several data sources ‚Äì radar data processing, flight data processing and automatic dependent surveillance. * Aeronautical Reference Data Display & Distribution System (ARDDDS): A display providing access to a wide range of information including aircraft performance data, weather radar, airport/navigation aid/tracking point codes, airline ICAO designators, Standard Arrival Route (STAR) and Standard Instrument Departure (SID) charts and depiction of the airspace setup for TMA sectors. *Voice Switching and Communications Select (VSCS) panel: A touch- sensitive screen allows controllers to choose the radio frequency they need to talk to pilots and ground staff, or the intercom for talking with other controllers. *Auxiliary Display: The controller can call up a wide range of information such as weather forecasts, flight plans, strip windows, secondary maps and other material for the information of themselves and pilots. How TAAATS works There are two flight information regions (FIRs) separated by an approximately diagonal line running from the northwest near the border with Indonesia to the southeast near Sydney. There are two Air Traffic Service Centres (ATSCs), one in Brisbane and another in Melbourne each responsible for providing air traffic control services in their FIRs. The Brisbane Centre is responsible for the FIR northeast of the line, and the Melbourne Centre for the FIR southwest. With the implementation of OneSKY, the Brisbane FIR will be merged in to the Melbourne FIR and the Melbourne Centre will thus be responsible for the entirety of Australia's enroute airspace. The physical Brisbane Centre will remain, however its facilities will only be used for air traffic control in the local area around Brisbane, as is the current case with the Terminal Control Units (TCUs) located in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney which were once responsible for their own FIRs under the previous structure. The TCUs in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney are responsible for providing air traffic control services in their Terminal Areas (TMAs), which laterally cover radii of around Adelaide and Perth, and a radius of in the case of Sydney; and vertically cover from the surface to in the case of Perth, in the case of Adelaide and in the case of Sydney. The physical Brisbane and Melbourne Centres contain 42 individual workstations divided into groups responsible for different sectors within each of their FIRs. A number of safeguards have been built into the system to reduce the risk of malfunction. For example, almost all of the electronic systems have been duplicated ‚Äì standby equipment is ready to switch into immediate operation if the main equipment fails. Both Brisbane and Melbourne Centres contain a simulator for training new air traffic controllers, but these simulators can be converted to operational control suites for the other control centre within 48 hours in the event of a devastating failure. TAAATS incorporates ADS-B from more than 70 stations located at various sites across the country. The system introduced new features to air traffic control in Australia including conflict alerting and conformance monitoring. Previous structure Australian airspace was previously divided into six FIRs, based roughly on State boundaries. So, for example, when an aircraft flew from Perth to Sydney, the pilots would communicate with air traffic control in the following order: *The tower at Perth Airport gave instructions for runway taxiing and scheduling of take-off; *A departure controller in Perth gave instructions for the climb out of Perth; *An en route controller in Perth tracked the aircraft's progress as it headed east across the State; *An en route controller in Adelaide tracked the aircraft as it traversed South Australia; *An en route controller in Sydney tracked the aircraft once it entered New South Wales; *An approach controller in Sydney gave the flight instructions for a safe approach into Sydney; and, finally, *The tower at Sydney Airport issued landing and taxiing instructions. Handwritten paper flight progress strips were used to track flights. Contingency Each centre simulator contains 10 consoles that can be configured to take over from the sister centre in the unlikely event that an entire centre is taken offline by a catastrophe. For individual console failures, control functions can be quickly transferred to a spare suite by a few mouse clicks on the supervisor's console.

Versions for the Japanese market were done in 1996 by Asmik for the PlayStation and MediaQuest for the Sega Saturn, renamed as Hard Rock Cab and Death Throttle respectively. In the game the player drives a taxicab through a post-apocalyptic city, picking up customers and killing enemies. Due to the gratuitous violence the game was controversial at the time of release. Background history The success of Doom by id Software in 1993 led to many other companies attempting to follow Doom's success. Most ended up making unsuccessful \\"doom clones\\". Quarantine was one of the few games that successfully exploited the features of Doom with its own texture mapped stages, semi-open world maps, and vehicular combat gameplay. The game was later continued with the sequel, Quarantine II: Road Warrior, which largely kept the original gameplay, but introduced a more mission and story-driven gameplay. Plot KEMO city was known for the manufacture of hovercars, meeting the country's demands for transportation until 2022. Over time, however, the crime rate had risen so far that the economy collapsed and the city descended into disorder. Criminals roamed the streets in armored hovercars, terrorizing the citizens without fear of retribution. In 2029, OmniCorp promised city officials that it could clean up KEMO and return it to normal. The offer was accepted, and the corporation began the construction of a massive wall around the city under the guise of a \\"defensive measure\\". The wall was completed three years later, and the only exit sealed shut, turning KEMO into a massive prison city for all inside, criminal or otherwise. The outraged population reacted violently, and the city degenerated. Ten years later OmniCorp decided to test the behavior altering chemical Hydergine 344 on the population of KEMO. This chemical was supposed to pacify the citizens and distributed through the city's water supply. Unfortunately, OmniCorp failed to predict the chemical's reaction to stagnant water, resulting in massive brain damage and insanity in the many citizens. More than half the population became crazed killers overnight. Drake Edgewater, a 21st-century cab driver and one of the lucky few unaffected by the spreading virus, is desperate to escape the city alive. Driving his '52 Checker hovercab armed with an assortment of vehicle-mounted weaponry, he delivers passengers and packages for what money he can make to upgrade his vehicle and escape. Gameplay The primary gameplay loop of Quarantine consists of using a weapon-equipped taxi to pick up passengers, deliver packages, and defeat enemies. In between missions, the player replenishes the taxi's ammunition and armor by visiting service stations, marked on the player's map. Missions send the player through Kemo City's various districts. Progression from one zone to the next is blocked by password-protected gates until the player has completed enough story missions to advance. Quarantine required a rather powerful system when it was released. One of the original ads in magazines for the game used the slogan \\"If you've got the ram, we've got the pedestrians.\\" Quarantine, long before Grand Theft Auto III and other similar games, employed the drive-by shooting tactic of using the Uzi to shoot out from the side windows. Soundtrack The CD version features tracks from Australian alternative bands. # You Am I ‚Äì Berlin Chair (2:42) # The Fauves ‚Äì The Driver Is You (3:38) # Custard ‚Äì The Wahooti Fandango (3:00) # Smudge ‚Äì Ingrown (3:13) # Godstar ‚Äì Lie Down Forever (3:26) # Screamfeeder ‚Äì Snail Trail (2:49) # The Daisygrinders ‚Äì Uranium Watch (3:47) # Underground Lovers ‚Äì Weak Will (5:29) # The Hellmenn ‚Äì Whirlwind (4:17) # Crow ‚Äì Yellow Beam (5:00) # Sidewinder ‚Äì Now You Know (4:51) Versions The PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions were released in Japan exclusively, under the names Hard Rock Cab and Death Throttle, respectively. They are mostly the same as the original PC version, but while they had enhanced floor and building texturing, they suffer from slowdown and pixelation. The essential textscreen information is translated to Japanese, though most text remains in English and the live action video is neither dubbed nor subtitled. Additionally, the PlayStation version features green blood censorship. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, stating that \\"Plenty of new weapons and powerup items along with different mission options give the game long-term play potential. Bloody fun for budding psychotics.\\" Reviewing the 3DO version, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were divided. They all concurred that the driving controls are subpar, but while three of them opined that Quarantine would appeal to a niche audience (one predicted it \\"may be a cult hit\\") with its soundtrack and strange, tongue-in-cheek humor, the fourth simply declared it \\"Too warped for me.\\" GamePro's reviewer also predicted the game was \\"bound to gain cult status\\" and gave it a rave review, praising the usefulness of the four camera views, the high level of uncensored violence, the introductory FMV, the \\"macabre\\" backgrounds, and the large selection of rock music tracks. They noted that the driving controls are difficult but concluded that \\"Doom lovers looking to score more gore will dig this grim, futuristic escape saga\\". A reviewer for Next Generation commented that while the open world, open-ended structure is captivating, both it and the vehicle's controls have a steep learning curve which demands that the player spend considerable time learning the game before actually playing it. He concluded that \\"the game is on balance, once you get the hang of things, and it's cool\\". Mark Clarkson from Computer Gaming World faced some compatibility issues trying to play the game - about once in every three times, the sound card failed to be recognized by the game. Also, the game locked up occasionally, needing a computer-reset to fix. He described playing Quarantine as being \\"like playing Doom from a car in a universe that's equal parts Escape from New York and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" He praised the game world and its landscape and felt that some of the included music was \\"pretty good.\\" He concludes that \\"small errors, inconsistencies and a very loose interpretation of \\"driving\\" make [the game] a slightly more bumpy ride than was intended.\\" Sequel A sequel, Quarantine II: Road Warrior, was released in 1995 for DOS.

He returned to England only to discover that the English construction trades demanded more time and service for advancement. He decided that his then capabilities would be more appropriate to the less-structured opportunities in America. Parkinson went to California, settling in Napa where he again worked as a stair-builder, and he took on architectural commissions in his spare time. =Seattle practice= The Interurban Building, 2007 In January 1889, John Parkinson moved to Seattle, where he opened his first architectural practice after failing to secure a position as a draftsman. In March he entered a partnership with Cecil Evers, but this ended little more than a year later. Parkinson's early projects included the Olympia Hotel, Olympia (1889; destroyed), the Calkins Hotel, Mercer Island (1889; destroyed), and several residences. After the Great Seattle Fire of 6 June 1889, he secured several important business blocks, the Butler Block (1889‚Äì90; altered), and the Seattle First National Bank Building, later called the Interurban Building (1890‚Äì92), an exemplary work of Romanesque Revival architecture. In 1891, Parkinson won the design competition for the B.F. Day School (1891‚Äì92; altered), located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. Thereafter the Seattle School Board appointed Parkinson as the Seattle Schools Architect and Superintendent. Parkinson was responsible for all Seattle Schools projects over the next several years, including the Pacific School (1892‚Äì93; destroyed) and the Cascade School (1893‚Äì94; destroyed). He also designed the Seattle Seminary (1891‚Äì93)--the first building at Seattle Pacific University (now known as Alexander Hall); and the Jesuit College and Church (1893‚Äì94; altered)--the first building at Seattle University (now known as the Garrand Building). Parkinson frequently published renderings of his buildings in the professional architectural press. He was an early member of the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (predecessor to today's AIA Seattle chapter). Parkinson invested in real estate and he was both architect and developer of the Seattle Athletic Club Building (1893‚Äì94; destroyed). His investments left him financially vulnerable when the Panic of 1893, the severe national depression, curtailed construction after June 1893. Parkinson's schools position was terminated by the Seattle School Board early in 1894. In 1893 and 1894, he entered several competitions, but failed to win any commissions. =Parkinson firm in Los Angeles= Faced with no projects, nor prospects for work in Seattle, John Parkinson moved to Los Angeles in 1894 and opened his architecture office on Spring Street between Second and Third Streets. By 1896, Parkinson had designed the city's first Class \\"A\\" fireproof steel-frame structure: the Homer Laughlin Building at Third Street and Broadway. His 1901 Susana Machado Bernard House and Barn has been designated as a Historic Cultural Monument and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. His design for the 1904 Braly Block at Fourth Street and Spring became the first \\"skyscraper\\" built in Los Angeles. It held the distinction of being the tallest structure in town until the completion of City Hall in 1928. In 1905, Parkinson formed a partnership with G. Edwin Bergstrom which lasted for ten years. Parkinson and Bergstrom became the dominant architectural firm for major structures in Los Angeles. Bergstrom left to establish his own successful practice in 1915. Parkinson & Parkinson John Parkinson was joined in 1920 by his son, Donald B. Parkinson (1895‚Äî1945). Parkinson & Parkinson designed many of Los Angeles' finest buildings, which became some of the city's most enduring landmarks. Found on the impressive roster are: the Campus Master Plan and several noted buildings of the University of Southern California (1919‚Äì39), the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (1923 and 1930‚Äì31), Los Angeles City Hall (1928, with Albert C. Martin/structural and John C. Austin/working drawings), Bullocks Wilshire (1929) and Union Station (1939). John Parkinson completed an important early renovation of Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Their work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

He was born, and died, in Paris. Biography Cl√©rambault came from a musical family (his father and two of his sons were also musicians). While very young, he learned to play the violin and harpsichord and he studied the organ with Andr√© Raison. Cl√©rambault also studied composition and voice with Jean-Baptiste Moreau. Cl√©rambault became the organist at the church of the Grands-Augustins and entered the service of Madame de Maintenon. After the death of Louis XIV and Guillaume- Gabriel Nivers, he succeeded the latter at the organ of the church of Saint- Sulpice and the royal house of Saint-Cyr, an institution for young girls from the poor nobility. He was responsible there for music, the organ, directing chants and choir, etc. It was in this post‚Äîit remained his after the death of Madame de Maintenon‚Äîthat he developed the genre of the \\"French cantata\\" of which he was the uncontested master. In 1719 he succeeded his teacher Andr√© Raison at the organs of the church of the Grands-Jacobins. His Motet du Saint Sacrement in G major is one of the first French works known to have been performed in Philadelphia.Annals of Music in Philadelphia Works His important published work includes: *a large number of religious pieces with chants and choirs, (motets, hymns, Magnificat, Te Deum etc.); *more than 25 secular cantatas on subjects often inspired by Greco-Roman myths; *sonatas for violin and basso continuo: *a book of dance pieces for the harpsichord (1704) in which he adopted the tradition of the unmeasured prelude; *a book of organ pieces in two suites (1710) in which melodic charm wins out over religious spirit. These two collections seemed destined to begin a cycle of pieces in all keys but Cl√©rambault never completed the cycle. =By opus number= * 1: Cantata Book I No. 1: L'amour piqu√© par une abeille * 2: Cantata Book I No. 2: Le jaloux * 3: Cantata Book I No. 3: Orph√©e * 4: Cantata Book I No. 4: Polyph√™me * 5: Cantata Book I No. 5: M√©d√©e * 6: Cantata Book I No. 6: L'amour et Bacchus * 7: Cantata Book II No. 1: Alph√©e et Ar√©thuse * 8: Cantata Book II No. 2: L√©andre et H√©ro * 9: Cantata Book II No. 3: La musette * 10: Cantata Book II No. 4: Pirame et Tisb√© * 11: Cantata Book II No. 5: Pigmalion * 12: Cantata Book II No. 6: Le triomphe de la paix * 13: Cantata: Le bouclier de Minerve * 14: Cantata: Abraham * 15: Cantata Book III No. 1: Apollon * 16: Cantata Book III No. 2: Z√©phire et Flore * 17: Cantata Book III No. 3: L'isle de D√©los * 18: Cantata Book III No. 4: La mort d'Hercule * 19: Cantata: La muse de l'Op√©ra * 20: Cantata Book IV No. 1: L'amour gu√©ri par l'amour * 21: Cantata Book IV No. 2: Apollon et Doris * 22: Cantata: Le soleil, vainqueur des nuages * 23: Cantata Book V No. 1: Clitie * 24: Cantata Book V No. 2: Les forges de Vulcain * 25: Cantata: Les francs mas√ßons * 26: Choeurs et interm√®des de l'idille de St Cyr * 27: Choeurs de l'idille de St Cyr sur le d√©part du roi * 28: Le triomphe d'Iris * 29: Le triomphe de la vertu, ou Hercule vainqueur des plaisirs * 30: Himne de Saint Louis * 31: Idille sur la naissance de N√¥tre Seigneur de Moreau (arrangement) * 32: Le retour du printemps (lost) * 33: Daphnis et Sylvie (lost) * 34: Air √† boire: Enfin nos voeux sont satisfaits in C major * 35: Air √† boire: C'en est fait j'ai bris√© ma cha√Æne in G major * 36: Air italien: Vuol parlar il mio cuore in F major * 37: Air √† boire: Buveurs trop alt√©r√©s in E minor * 38: Ariette: H√©las!

Since 2000 CTA has operated within the framework of the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement with a mission to ‚Äústrengthen policy and institutional capacity development and information and communication management capacities of ACP agricultural and rural development organisations. It assists such organisations in formulating and implementing policies and programmes to reduce poverty, promote sustainable food security, preserve the natural resource base and thus contribute to building self-reliance in ACP rural and agricultural development.‚Äù Cotonou Agreement Background CTA is mainly funded by the European Union. It initially focused on information dissemination but, more recently, has moved towards implementing some technical programmes. It works primarily with partner organisations at regional level in the Caribbean and Pacific and at sub-regional level in Africa. CTA celebrated its 30th anniversary in Brussels on 4 April, 2014. The Centre, which is based in Wageningen, the Netherlands, is active in seventy nine ACP countries. It also has an office in Brussels. Although it does not work in non-ACP countries, participants from these countries are welcome to attend its annual conferences and to download its publications. While CTA‚Äôs resources are derived mainly from the European Development Fund, it also obtains funding from other European programmes, countries or donors through grants or co-funding for operations. Key activities =Programmes= CTA focuses on three key areas: CTA Strategic Plan * Multi-stakeholder policy formulation and implementation at national, regional and international levels. Discussion of issues such as food and nutritional security, the impact of climate change on agriculture, regional trade, and agricultural innovation is promoted, with an emphasis on the involvement of farmers‚Äô groups, the private sector, women and youth. CTA works with policy-makers in the ACP and the EU to promote dialogue and convey key policy messages. *Efficient agricultural value chains. With partners in ACP countries, CTA works to maximize inclusion of smallholders in new, more sophisticated value chains as well as to strengthen their involvement in priority food crop and commodity markets. Improving market information, promoting the flow of finance to and through value chains, and improving capacity of key players at all stages of chains are some of the Centre‚Äôs priority areas, as is the development of agricultural trade by ACP countries . *Information, communication and knowledge management for agricultural and rural development. To help ACP institutions to promote policies and innovations that can benefit rural communities, CTA publishes both journals and books (including online) and has many specialized websites. It works with ACP countries to develop knowledge management skills and to promote the use of communication channels, old and new, to improve the flow of information (e.g., e-communities, web portals, seminars, and study visits). It has an active programme of training and development for ICT for Development and web 2.0 for Development. It offers a wide range of publications (in English and French) available free of charge to organisations in ACP countries or for free download by all . =Conferences= CTA organises a major international conference annually on topics closely related to its work programme. Recent conferences have been: *International conference on Innovations in Extension and Advisory Services, Nairobi, 2011 *Making the Connection: value chains for transforming smallholder agriculture, Addis Ababa, 2012 *ICT4Ag: The digital springboard for inclusive agriculture, Kigali, 2013 * Fin4Ag, a conference on Value Chain finance will be held in Nairobi in July 2014. =Products, projects and services= CTA‚Äôs services (available in English and French) include: * Spore.

Some authorities only recognise a single species of sailfish, I. platyperus. It is theorized by marine biologists that the 'sail' (dorsal fin array) of the sailfish may serve the purpose of a cooling and heating system for this fish; this due to a network of a large number of blood vessels found in the sail and because of \\"sail-raising\\" behaviour exhibited by the sailfish at or near the surface waters after or before high-speed bursts. Fisheries Common and widespread in the tropical and sub-tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans, ranging into temperate waters.

Formation World War I saw the beginning of aerial combat. By 1 April 1918 the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service had amalgamated into the Royal Air Force. Hugh Trenchard had been appointed Chief of the Air Staff and quickly discovered that specialist groundcrew were in very short supply. Wartime use of aircraft accelerated the development of new technologies. Aircraft power plants were vastly different from those that powered buses and lorries. Airframes, with their need to reduce drag and provide control in the air, were a totally new challenge. Armourers were asked to develop new fusing methods for equally new explosive devices like air-dropped bombs. Aircraft electrical systems included bomb release mechanisms and synchronised gun firing through the propeller via the use of an interrupter mechanism. The addition of a third dimension to navigation meant aircraft instrument makers had to produce new indicators for such things as turn and bank, air speed and an artificial horizon. For these reasons and others, Trenchard instituted the Aircraft Apprentice Scheme to be based at RAF Halton No. 1 School of Technical Training. Because of lack of accommodation at Halton, the school was originally located at RAF Cranwell in 1920 where Sir Frank Whittle (Jet Engine Designer) received his early aero engine training as an Aircraft Apprentice. In 1922 the school moved permanently to RAF Halton and was fully operational by 1926. The Aircraft Apprentice School at RAF Cranwell (Nos. 1 and 6 Radio Schools) continued to train apprentices exclusively for the ground and air radio trades. The apprentice school at Cranwell operated until October 1952 before being transferred to RAF Locking Training Entrance to the scheme involved a highly competitive exam, intelligence and aptitude tests, and medical examinations. Admittance was limited exclusively to males between the ages of 15 and 17¬Ω and the Royal Air Force assumed legal guardianship of the boys in loco parentis. Initially, training was a three-year course, although this was changed briefly to two years for some apprentice entries during the Second World War. Training took place over five and a half days a week, and consisted of both academic and practical training. In addition, basic military training was given. Originally, applicants were required to be British subjects and of \\"pure European descent\\" (and were required to prove this if there was any doubt).Air Ministry, Royal Air Force Aircraft Apprentices: Conditions of Entry and Service, 12th edition, 1938 Apprentices were later accepted from both Commonwealth and other countries. 106 Entry, which passed out in December 1966, was the last of the Aircraft Apprentice entries. A three-year Technician Apprentice scheme, a two-year Craft Apprentice scheme, and a one-year Administrative Apprentice scheme were initiated in September 1964, with 107 Entry being the first Technician Apprentice entry, 201 Entry being the first of the Craft Apprentice entries, and 301 Entry being the first of the Administrative Apprentice entries. A one-year scheme for mechanic apprentices was also subsequently introduced (the 400 series entry apprentices). Alumni It is estimated that as many as forty percent of the \\"Trenchard Brats\\" or the \\"Poacher's Brats\\" (as the Cranwell Apprentices were called because of their Lincolnshire connection), achieved commissioned rank, and a considerable number achieved Air rank. Graduates of this scheme include several former officers of Air rank, including Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle, father of the jet engine, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Keith Williamson, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Armitage, Air Marshal Sir Graham Miller, and Air Marshal Cliff Spink The Brats' alumni association, a registered charity, is called the RAF Halton Apprentices Association (RAFHAA), or Old Haltonians. It publishes a magazine called The Haltonian three times a year. A triennial reunion for Brats is organised by the association. RAF Halton has its own memorial to the brats opposite Kermode Hall, very close to St George's Church, which contains stained glass windows commemorating the 40,000 or so apprentices who were trained there. Brats are also remembered at the Halton Grove, which is part of the National Memorial Arboretum, Alrewas, Staffordshire.

It is located on the Tyne Valley Line which runs from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle. The station is owned by Network Rail and is managed by Northern, who provide all passenger train services. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (upper left) railways in the vicinity of Hexham Dating from around 1835, Hexham station is one of the oldest purpose-built railway stations in the world and is a grade II listed building. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was formed in 1829, and was opened in stages. The first section of that line to open for passenger trains was between and Hexham, which was formally opened on 3 March 1835, with normal services beginning either the next day, or on 9 March 1835. The line was extended from Hexham to on 28 June 1836. After the N&CR; had been absorbed by the North Eastern Railway, Hexham became a junction station with the opening of the first section of the Border Counties Railway, between Hexham and on 5 April 1858. The first section of a second branch, the Hexham and Allendale Railway (H&AR;) was opened (for goods) in August 1867 - the H&AR;, initially promoted to serve lead mines, opened for passengers on 1 March 1869. On the main line, the next station to the west of Hexham was , which closed in 1967. The station has diminished in size and importance since the closure of the Allendale branch (to passengers on 22 September 1930, completely in 1950) and the Border Counties Railway (to passengers October 1956, all traffic 1958), both of which met the Tyne Valley line west of Hexham station. The bay platform used by both branch lines was located on the southern side and faced west; it was taken out of use in the early 1970s and the track lifted (the land now forms part of the station car park). The track layout has also been rationalised, with just a running loop and three sidings retained at the east end of the station along with the distinctive elevated signal box - this was built in 1896, is also grade-II listed and one of only two such structures left on the line (the other being at ). In 2013 and 2014 a major Network Rail managed redevelopment scheme was undertaken. The goods yard on the south east side became a retail park. The Victorian railway stables were relocated to Beamish Museum. Both of the Victorian goods shed buildings are to be re-used. On the north side a new entrance and car park were created allowing step-free access to that platform. The floral displays have won several awards from the Britain in Bloom scheme. Since the mid 2000s the station has accommodated office space for the Tyne Valley Community Rail Partnership who opened a kiosk in 2011. Facilities The station is staffed on a part-time basis, with the ticket office on platform 2 open on weekdays from 07:1517:30 and 08:1514:15 on Saturdays. There are now four ticket machines at the station - two on each platform. There are waiting rooms on both platforms along with toilets, vending machines, a retail outlet, taxi office and refreshment facilities (a fast food restaurant) on platform 2. Step-free access is available to both platforms. There is a bus stop and a taxi rank outside the station. The station has two waiting rooms. The waiting room on platform 2 has a fireplace made of black marble, which includes many fossilised orthoceras cephalopods, dated to approximately 400 million years old. Services The station has a 2tph Northern service on weekdays westwards to Carlisle, though the through trains beyond towards Glasgow Central have now ceased. There are three trains per hour to Newcastle - two of which run through from Carlisle and serve only and , whilst the other starts at Hexham and calls at the intermediate stations. Many of the latter continue on via the Durham Coast Line to and , whilst others run to . On Sundays an hourly service operates between Carlisle and Newcastle (with many services continuing to Middlesbrough or beyond). In January 2016, a landslip between Corbridge and Riding Mill (caused by persistent heavy rain and a broken drainage pipe) led to the temporary suspension of services between Hexham and Prudhoe whilst repairs to the track and adjacent cutting walls were carried out. Trains to/from Carlisle terminated and reversed at Hexham, whilst a replacement bus service ran to Prudhoe, until the work was completed. The line reopened to traffic on 8 February 2016, following the removal of over 35,000 tonnes of earth from the site.

Biography Born in New York City, United States to a significant Lubavitcher family, he arrived in Melbourne, Australia for the first time in 1953 at the bidding of the prior Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, and began his position officially in 1958. He has been referred to as one of the pioneers and builders of the Melbourne Jewish community. He was also known for his Talmudic erudition, his sermons and rousing High Holiday cantorial services (chazzanut) in the Yeshivah synagogue, specifically Ne'ilah. On 18 May 2008, he explained at a Shabbat gathering that he was the forerunner and organiser of the Lag B'Omer Parade in 1942 and personally arranged the event as a request from Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson spoke for the first time in a public fashion at that gathering and Rabbi Groner suggested that somebody should take notes. In fact, the entire talk is available today thanks to Rabbi Groner. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, the then Prime Minister John Howard said: Rabbi Groner died on the morning of Monday, 7 July 2008, aged 83;Rabbi Yitzchok Groner dies, aged 83 AJN 7 July 2008 and was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Sex abuse cover up Groner was a major figure posthumously in the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The commission looked at various employees of the school who were permitted to continue in their role at the school despite reports against them. The highest profile of these was David Cyprys, who it was claimed Groner had tried to 'cure' from his abusive ways, and had tried to manage rather than report to police. It was stated that the scandal was ignored by both Groner, whose \\"authority was absolute\\" and Avrohom Glick, the principal of the school, although Glick pleaded ignorance on behalf of all involved. There are a number of people who defend Groner, and claim he did the best for the community based on the information at the time although the Royal Commission heard varying accounts of these events, and there were claims that people who were speaking out against the Yeshivah Centre at the commission were being shunned by the community. His children publicly apologised to victims on his behalf. Family His brother, Leib was a personal secretary to the former Rebbe. He was survived by his wife, Rebbetzin Devorah (17 May 1926 ‚Äì 27 May 2018), and his children, many of whom were involved in leading their own congregations: *Rabbi Sholom Ber Groner (South Africa) *Rebbitzen Miriam Telsner *Rebbitzen Shterna Zirkind (Crown Heights, New York) *Rabbi Yossi Groner *Rebbitzen Chaya Haller (South Africa) *Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Groner *Rebbitzen Rivkah Yurkowicz *Rabbi Mendy Groner References External links *The Rebbe‚Äôs man downunder - Australian Jewish News, 23 July 2004 *Yeshiva-Beth Rivkah School site *Chief rabbi dies - The Australian Category:1925 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American Hasidic rabbis Category:American emigrants to Australia Category:Australian Hasidic rabbis Category:Chabad-Lubavitch rabbis Category:Religious leaders from New York City Category:Religious leaders from Melbourne Category:Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives Category:Australian Jews ","title":"Yitzchok Dovid Groner"},{"id":"3896519","text":"Pastilla () is a North African cuisine meat or seafood pie made with warqa dough (), which is similar to filo. It is a specialty of Morocco and Algeria, where it is called r‚Äôzima () or tajik. It has more recently been spread by emigrants to France, Israel, and North America.  Origin  The name of the pie comes from the Spanish word pastilla, meaning in modern Spanish either \\"pill\\" or \\"small pastry\\" after the transformation of the phoneme \\"p\\" into \\"b\\" that is specific to the Arabic language.Bastilla. Clifford A Wright. 2016 The researcher Anny Gaul attests to recipes that bear \\"a strong resemblance to the stuffing that goes inside modern-day bastila\\" in 13th century Andalusi cookbooks, such as Ibn Razƒ´n al-Tujƒ´bƒ´'s . The historian Idriss Bouhlila, while acknowledging that Tetuanis consider the dish to be of Andalusi origin, posited that the dish was introduced into Morocco by the Algerians who migrated to T√©touan after the French invasion of Algiers in 1830, corroborating Gaul's theory that its name, which according to Bouhlila is of Turkish origin, and the werqa pastry used to make it spread from Tetuan to the rest of Morocco sometime after 1830. According to the Professor Ken Albala, the basic concept of pastilla was probably brought to Morocco by Moorish Muslims who left Spain in the 16th century, or perhaps earlier, because there had been considerable traffic between Morocco ans Spain since the Moors conquered the latter in the seventh century. In Morocco, there are two main versions of pastilla: one with poultry and one with seafood. Pastilla is generally served as a starter at the beginning of special meals. In Algeria, Pastilla is usually made with chicken or with pigeon. Poultry pastilla Poultry pastilla ornately dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon.Poultry pastilla was traditionally made of squab (fledgling pigeons), but shredded chicken is more often used today. It combines sweet and salty flavours; crisp layers of the cr√™pe-like werqa dough, savory meat slow-cooked in broth and spices and then shredded, and a crunchy layer of toasted and ground almonds, cinnamon, and sugar. The filling is made by browning the poultry in butter. Chopped onions, water, parsley, and various spices including saffron are added and the meat is simmered until tender. When cool, the meat is boned and the flesh shredded. The liquid is reduced and thickened with eggs to form a custard-like sauce. Meat and custard are often prepared the day ahead. Blanched almonds are fried in oil, then crushed finely and mixed with powdered sugar and cinnamon. In a round baking pan, several pieces of the thin werqa or filo dough are layered, each brushed with melted butter, and overhanging the edge of the pan. The cook adds the egg mixture, places another buttered sheet of dough over it, adds the shredded meat, also covered with a sheet of dough, and then the almond mixture is added. The overlapping pieces of dough are folded over the filling, and another 2 pieces of buttered dough are added and tucked in around the edges of the pie. The pie is baked until heated through, and the layers of dough are brown. Powdered sugar and cinnamon are sprinkled over the top before serving hot.https://www.196flavors.com/morocco-pastilla/  Seafood pastilla  Fish pastilla in Beni Mellal Seafood pastilla () usually contains fish and other seafood, in addition to vermicelli. Unlike poultry pastilla, seafood pastilla is not sweet, but spicy. Whereas poultry pastilla is dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon, seafood pastilla is usually dressed with a light sprinkle of shredded cheese and a few slices of lemon. This version of pastilla is often served at Moroccan weddings. Pastilla with milk Fes, with fried waraq pastry, cream, orange blossom water, and toasted almond slices. In the traditional Fassi cuisine, pastilla can also be served as a dessert, in which case, the pastilla is called Jowhara (, jewel) or \\"Pastilla with milk\\". This pastilla is also made of warka and a milky cream put between the sheets. The Jowhara is flavored with orange flower water and decorated with cinnamon and sugar. Sephardic Jewish version Among Moroccan Jews, pastilla is made with olive oil or margarine to follow kosher rules. An increasingly popular variant makes individual pastries rather than large pies.

The plant was built in 1957 and has seen many expansions and upgrades. The plant manufactured the third generation, North American Ford Focus from December 14, 2010 until May 4th, 2018.  History  The plant opened in 1957, as the Michigan Station Wagon Plant producing Mercury station wagons. In 1964 the plant was re-tooled to produce pickup trucks, producing the first F-100. In 1965 the 100,000th truck rolled off the line. In 1968 two large additions were made to the plant that increased overall capacity. The plant was expanded again in 1974, 1991 and 1996. In 1997 the plant began producing SUV's, and in 2010 was re-tooled again to produce the Focus. By late 2010, Ford completed a $550 million renovation, enabling the plant to change production between various models without significant downtime and to produce gas-powered cars as well as battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid variations. The renovation also included a 500-kilowatt solar panel system and ten electric vehicle charging stations for recharging electric part-transport trucks running between adjacent facilities. Ford plans to reintroduce the Ford Ranger pickup in the North American market by the 2019 model year with the Bronco to follow by 2020, and they will be produced at the Wayne plant.

The Hollywood version of the movie is still frozen and it is unknown if Star Cinema have decided to have a contract with Hollywood. A sequel, Feng Shui 2, was released on December 25, 2014 as the official entry to the 2014 Metro Manila Film Festival. Plot While on a bus, Joy Ramirez (Kris Aquino) finds a package left by a man (Emil Sandoval). She visits Aling Biring (Luz Fernandez) at the bakery and shows her the package: an antique bagua mirror. Following feng shui tradition, Biring thinks that the mirror will drive away evil spirits and bring good luck to her husband Inton (Jay Manalo) and their children Denton (John Vladimir Manalo) and Ingrid (Julianne Gomez). Joy places the bagua mirror in her home and a series of fortunate events happen: her friend Alice (Lotlot de Leon) grants her a promotion and she wins the grand prize at a grocery store. The series of events makes Joy suspicious of her luck. The next day, Joy recognizes the man who left the mirror on the bus, identified as Evart Mendoza, was run over by a Rabbit Liner bus. She discovers that he was born in the year of the Rabbit after she examines his age. Later, Joy learns that Aling Biring died from leptospirosis that morning; her birth corresponding to the year of the Rat. Denton's friend Billy (Ernesto Sto. Tomas) tells Joy about the omens and deaths occurring in their neighborhood. Joy sees tricycle driver Mang Nestor, who was killed earlier in a brawl at a cockfight, having been born in the year of the Rooster. She is later haunted by the ghosts of Nestor, Biring, Evart, and a woman. Their deaths are connected to the Chinese zodiac of their birth year. Joy visits Evart's wife Lily (Cherry Pie Picache), who tells her about the bagua's history; Lily found the bagua in an old, dilapidated rental house during her years as a real estate agent and decided to keep it. The artifact brought her good luck, but like Joy, also left a series of deaths. Lily reveals that anyone who owned the bagua would receive good fortunes, but for each stroke of luck, a death would always follow afterward. She urges Joy to return the mirror to her instead, but the latter refuses and leaves. Later, after Joy accepts an inheritance from her late client, she learns that the subdivision's security guard, whose reflection he had seen in the bagua mirror, has been found dead from a snakebite. The security guard was revealed to be born on the year of the Snake. Joy, along with Alice and their friend Thelma (Ilonah Jean), seeks help from a local geomancer Hsui Liao (Joonee Gamboa). Liao reveals to them that the bagua was once owned long ago by two siblings‚Äîbrother and sister‚Äîchildren from a wealthy Chinese family in ancient Shanghai. During the revolution of Sun Yat-sen, the family was forced to evacuate, wherein the brother abandoned his foot-bounded sister, nicknamed \\"Lotus Feet\\", referencing to the Chinese tradition of binding the feet of young girls to avert it's physical growth. Because the brother had thought of her as a burden, her servants had betrayed her and killed her by burning her at the stake. Before her death, she took the bagua and placed a curse on it, claiming that she will take the soul of anyone who sees their reflection on the mirror. Liao warns Joy that if she tries to destroy the mirror, the soul of the owner will be taken away before it restores itself. Before they leave, Alice realizes that she had glanced at the mirror earlier. Having suspected her husband's affair with his former lover Dina (Jenny Miller) at work, Joy begrudgingly confronts him. She later realizes after accepting the prize from the day she won at the grocery store earlier, revealing that Alice was next. After an argument, Alice, who was born in the year of the Horse, is assaulted by a drunk neighbor and dies after falling on a stack of crates of Red Horse Beer bottles from her window. The ghosts of all the victims haunt Joy's house and her family is forced to leave. Joy attempts to destroy the mirror, but is stopped by Alice's spirit. Joy eventually faints, overwhelmed by all the ghosts. The next morning, Master Liao calls Joy and tells her the key to end the curse: she must reject offers of good luck so that she would be able to destroy the mirror and save the next victim. Just before they leave, Billy gets involved in an accident and Joy volunteers for a blood transfusion to save him. She then realizes that Inton is the next victim. Joy arrives at the motel where Inton and Dina are to warn the former but she arrives too late as Dina's husband Louie arrives at the parking lot and kills his wife and Inton when they attempted to flee, both born in the year of the Dog. Joy pleads Louie as both of them were cheated on by their spouses and tried to help him, but Louie refuses as he commits suicide with his shotgun. Meanwhile, Thelma takes Denton and Ingrid with her in the hopes of taking them to their mother. Thelma sees a truck of cows and chickens in front of her car. She comes to the realization that Ingrid was born in the year of the Rooster, and Denton and herself were both born on the year of the Ox. Horrified, Thelma tries to alert the truck but an oncoming vehicle speeds towards them. Joy arrives home and is greeted by Regalado, a lawyer sent by Lily to offer Joy the chance of returning the bagua to her in exchange for money. Joy refuses the offer. Distraught by the string of deaths that followed her, Joy finally destroys the mirror. Thelma arrives with Denton and Ingrid. Joy is filled with relief thinking that she has finally broken the curse and saved her kids, but she soon discovers that they were all killed earlier in the truck accident along with Thelma after she saw her dead husband joining with them as Joy screams in horror. A family is shown moving into their new house and the family's twin daughters wander into Joy's former home while playing. They find the restored bagua and decide to show it to their parents. From Joy's house's window, the Lotus Lady watches over them, awaiting her next victim.

He is widely recognized for his pioneering work on Defense Independent Pitching Statistics (DIPS). DIPS McCracken first published his ideas about DIPS in 1999 on the rec.sports.baseball newsgroup on Usenet.McCracken's first \\"defensive independent pitching\\" post He also effectively named the new concept of \\"defense independent pitching\\" with that publication: \\"I've been working on a pitching evaluation tool and thought I'd post it here to get some feedback. I call it 'Defensive Independent Pitching' and what it does is evaluate a pitcher base[d] strictly on the statistics his defense has no ability to affect...\\".For an extended overview of the development of DIPS, see His findings implied that major league pitchers had little control over the outcome of balls put into play against them and specifically that the percentage of balls put into play against a particular pitcher that fell for hits did not correlate across seasons. This implied that elements beyond the pitcher's control, including defense, ballpark, weather and randomness, had significant effects upon his performance. McCracken's \\"Pitchers and Defense: How Much Control Do Hurlers Have?\\" was published on the Baseball Prospectus website in 2001 and was picked up on by baseball researchers and ESPN baseball writer and analyst Rob Neyer. After explaining McCracken's findings, including reporting some of his own calculations from the previous years' pitching statistics and describing the aspects of DIPS that were most original, Neyer concluded: \\"And it seems to me that anyone who wants to project pitcher performance should read McCracken's article, because it'll blow your mind.\\" In his book The Numbers Game, Alan Schwarz writes that McCracken told him ‚Äúall hell broke loose‚Äù after Neyer's column appeared.Alan Schwarz, The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics (New York: St. Martin's, 2005); . He received nearly 2,000 emails in the next couple of days and thousands more in the ensuing months. Sabermetrician Craig Wright agreed that hit rate is not as heavily influenced by the pitcher as is commonly believed, but at the same time concluded \\"... some [pitchers] emphasize pitches that are tough to hit sharply enough to get your share of hits on balls in play. I don't think the latter is a primary way for pitchers to distinguish themselves from others, but I do believe it is a more significant factor for some groups than others.\\" He specifically cited two groups, knuckleball pitchers and flyball pitchers, as examples of those who tend to allow fewer hits on balls in the field of play.Craig Wright's reaction to DIPS, espn.go.com; accessed November 11, 2016. Subsequent independent research by Phil Birnbaum, Clifford Blau and Tom Tippett confirmed Wright's findings, but Wright still praises McCracken as \\"... 'the' guy who really got people to understand that most folks overestimate the pitcher's ability to influence the number of hits that result from balls batted into the field of play.\\"Phil Birnbaum's comment on DIPS, diamondappraised.com; accessed November 11, 2016. Bill James also expressed some skepticism but recognized the potential value of McCracken's findings if further research bore them out. He argued that \\"the research really should be done, for several reasons. First, if McCracken turns out to be correct, this has important consequences, even allowing us, to a certain extent, to predict movements in pitcher's records. . . .\\" In his New Historical Baseball Abstract in 2001, James acknowledged that McCracken was correct, that the results were significant, and that James himself felt \\"stupid for not having realized it 30 years ago.\\" Rob Neyer noted the impact of McCracken's discovery on James' subsequent work. The discovery and its influence on baseball analysis is outlined in Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. McCracken continued to refine his new statistic, including addressing the issue of knuckleballers in his DIPS 2.0 in 2002. He published DIPS statistical results as well as extensions and improvements to his initial formulas in other forums, including Baseball Primer (now Baseball Think Factory).McCracken on DIPS 2.0, baseballthinkfactory.org, January 25, 2002.More McCracken on DIPS in Primer.Jay Jaffe on DIPS, futilityinfielder.com; accessed November 11, 2016. Baseball researchers have continued to evaluate and to propose refinements to DIPS, such as Tom Tippett in his 2003 article \\"Can Pitchers Prevent Hits on Balls in Play?\\".Tom Tippett on DIPS, Diamond-Mind.com; accessed November 11, 2016. Subsequent career =Red Sox= A year and a half after the publication of his \\"Pitchers and Defense\\" article, McCracken's discovery earned him a consulting position with the Boston Red Sox. An important consequence of this was that by early 2003, he ceased publishing revisions of his formulas or updated results. He announced this step with excitement on his website on February 18, 2003. McCracken worked for the Red Sox through June 2005. =After the Boston hiatus= McCracken continued to think about how to measure performance in a variety of organized sports, such as international football (American soccer).For example, see this intervention on BigSoccer.com in a discussion of \\"Sabermetrics Applying to Soccer\\": Big Soccer. In 2007, he began a blog, vorosmccracken.com, with the subtitle ‚Äútriumphant return of The Knack of the baseball world.\\" The blog focused much of its attention on international soccer, including ratings of the national teams and forecasts of team performance in the World Cup 2010 and other tournaments. But he has little involvement in baseball analysis. Jeff Passan has written,Jeff Passan, \\"Sabermetrician in Exile,\\" ThePostGame, (Yahoo Sports) June 23, 2012. > Of course, one great idea guarantees nothing. > Not prominence.

Chiefly associated with English club Everton, Gabriel played extensively in Scotland and England before ending his career with the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League. He then became a coach in both England and the US, where he lives today. Playing career =Dundee= Jimmy Gabriel first came to the attention of Dundee when he played at right-half for the Scotland under-15 schoolboys in an international at Dens Park. His talent shone through and Dundee manager Willie Thornton snapped him up after the game, despite interest from several other top clubs. He was initially loaned out to Dundee North End Juniors, but was recalled to Dens Park a year later. He made his debut for Dundee as a 17-year-old on 13 August 1958 in a 2‚Äì1 Scottish League Cup victory over Motherwell. He was to remain a first team regular at Dundee, going on to make 67 appearances. In March 1960, Bob Shankly had taken over as manager at Dundee and, although he wanted to keep Gabriel, was unable to refuse the offer of ¬£27,000 from Everton's manager, Johnny Carey. This made Jimmy the most expensive player to leave Scotland. =Everton= Gabriel joined Everton after three years at Dundee in March 1960. Although it took him some time to settle into the pace of the English game, there was a steely determination about the young Scot that was to stand him in good stead. Gabriel became a strong influence in the Everton side as a powerful right-half whose preference for a defensive role made him a useful partner in the midfield for the more attacking Brian Harris on the left. He played 304 games for Everton, scoring 37 goals and won two Scottish caps. He won the championship in 1962-3 and the FA Cup in 1966 with Everton.Jimmy Gabriel is \\"All the Best\\" of Sounders  goalWA.net By 1967, he was being challenged for his place in the side by Alan Ball and the emerging Howard Kendall. Southampton's manager Ted Bates tried to sign him initially in March 1967 but Gabriel was reluctant to move South. Eventually, when it was clear that Kendall was to be first-choice, Gabriel agreed to sign for the Saints in July, joining them for a fee of ¬£42,500. =Southampton= At Southampton, Gabriel was a vital part of the defence alongside John McGrath and Denis Hollywood and helped Saints avoid relegation several times. He was a tough defender but had skill to match. He was occasionally drafted in as an emergency striker with some degree of success. He played a total of 224 matches for the Saints, scoring 27 goals. =Bournemouth, Swindon and Brentford= He left The Dell at the end of the 1971‚Äì72 season to join Bournemouth. He also spent a short period on loan at Swindon Town before finishing his UK playing career at Brentford. =Seattle Sounders= In 1974 Gabriel moved to the United States where he joined the Seattle Sounders of the NASL as a player/assistant coach. That season he anchored the Sounders defence and earned second team NASL All Star recognition. In 1976 the Sounders moved to the newly built Kingdome where he scored the first goal in the stadium's history. The goal, a fabulous header off a cross from Tommy Jenkins, his former Southampton teammate, came against Pel√© and the New York Cosmos. In 1977, Gabriel replaced John Best as head coach of the Sounders. Even as a coach, he continued to suit up to play, seeing time in two games in 1977 and one in 1979. =International= Gabriel earned two caps with Scotland and six more with the Scotland under-23 team. Managerial career =Seattle Sounders and San Jose Earthquakes= Prior to becoming head coach of the Sounders, Gabriel had acted as an assistant coach and head of the Sounders reserve team program. When he became head coach he had several Sounder legends including Mike England, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore on his team. Under his guidance, Seattle made it to the championship game only to fall to the hated New York Cosmos. He was unable to replicate his first year success and in 1980, the Sounders replaced him with Alan Hinton. In 1980 he was contracted to coach ASL expansion team the Phoenix Fire, but the team folded in pre-season. Gabriel then went on to coach George Best and the San Jose Earthquakes (NASL) from 1980‚Äì1982 for one outdoor season and two indoor seasons. During the 1981‚Äì82 indoor season he appeared in a handful of indoor matches for San Jose. =Bournemouth and Everton= On returning to Britain in 1986, he spent four years as coach to Bournemouth, before going back to Goodison Park in 1990, where he became assistant to Colin Harvey at Everton. He was briefly caretaker manager of Everton for one game in November 1990 and for seven games between December 1993 and January 1994. According to Yahoo! Sports Gabriel's points per game average of 0.14 from his seven games makes him statistically the least successful manager of the Premier League era with one point from a possible 21 gained. He continued coaching Everton's reserves until 1997. =Back to Seattle= Gabriel returned to Seattle in 1997 where he became an assistant to Dean Wurzberger, who played for Gabriel on the Sounders reserve teams in the 1970s, on the Washington Huskies men's and women's teams. Both teams won the 2000 Pac-10 championships. In addition to other players, Jimmy coached Hope Solo. Gabriel has also been the coaching director of the Lake Washington Youth Soccer Association and has worked in certifying coaches for the State Association. Jimmy currently provides radio commentary for the Seattle Sounders. He and his wife, Pat, now reside in Kirkland, Washington. Gabriel also served several years as an assistant coach with the Sounders. On 2 October 2005, the Sounders defeated the Richmond Kickers to take the US Second Division championship. On this high note, Gabriel retired from the Sounders. On 29 March 2009, Gabriel was honoured by the new Seattle Sounders FC MLS club with the \\"Golden Scarf\\" award for his services to soccer in Seattle. He received the scarf at a ceremony on the pitch before the Sounders' second game, versus Real Salt Lake.

The game was re-released on the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2007 and in Asia in 2010. Gameplay The gameplay of Rapid Reload is often compared to the Treasure game Gunstar Heroes. The players choose to play as either male character Axel or female character Ruka through the game's six levels. The player can switch between four different weapons with a normal machine pistol, flamethrower, homing laser, and multi- directional cannons. The characters each have their own set of four weapons, totaling the weapons in the game to eight. Also available is a grappling hook that will latch onto any wall or ceiling. The player cannot be harmed while the player uses the hook. The player can also aim their weapons in any direction by holding R2 on the controller. The player can also throw their enemies in any direction, similar to how players Red and Blue can in Gunstar Heroes. The unique feature in Rapid Reload/Gunners Heaven is the point system. Points are dropped after the player destroys enemies. When the player collects these items, the counter on the top screen rises and eventually will count down. As the player collects more points, their shots from the weapons will become more powerful than the ordinary shots. Occasionally, the player can find a booster item that temporarily increases the player's weapon strength to unbelievable heights, making the player annihilate any enemy easily. Unfortunately, the timer is unforgiving, and the player has a very short time using the booster item. The game has six stages and during the stages, there is one or two sub-bosses and the one true boss. Plot Upon hearing the legend of the treasure known as the Valkiry, treasure hunters Axel Sonics (voiced by Kazuki Yao) and Ruka Hetfield (voiced by Noriko Hidaka) embark on an adventurous quest to find the legendary stone. However, unknown to Axel and Ruka at the start, there is also a terrorist organization known as the Pumpkin Heads searching for the Valkiry, determined to use the stone for world domination. In a race to reach the stone first, Axel and Ruka fight their way through the Pumpkin Heads' army of elite soldiers along several locations, destroying each of the three top captains and eventually reaching their hideout, where they confront the Master, who already has the Valkiry in her possession. Using the Valkiry to power herself, the Master engages Axel and Ruka in a decisive, final battle, but is eventually destroyed and the Valkiry is freed. The ending differs for each character: if Axel defeats the Master, he is joined by Ruka, who in her excitement takes the Valkiry and runs off, with the weary Axel only barely managing to keep up with her; if Ruka defeats the Master, she accidentally drops the Valkiry and it shatters, and in her frustration, she vows never to hunt for treasure again, although a caption mentions that she eventually stayed in the business with Axel. Release Rapid Reload was released in Europe and Japan but not in North America, due to Sony Computer Entertainment America's policy against releasing 2D games for the PlayStation.

Ivan Evstratiev Geshov () (20 February 1849 [8 February 1849 OS] - 11 March 1924) was a Bulgarian politician who served as Bulgarian Prime Minister. He was born in Plovdiv to a family of merchants originally from Karlovo. Geshov was educated at the Bulgarian Sts. Cyrill and Methodius High School in Plovdiv, as well as at Owens College in Manchester (1866-1869), where he studied logic and political economy under Stanley Jevons. Geshov first came to political attention through his involvement in the campaign for Bulgarian independence from the Ottoman Empire. He wrote a series of letters against the Ottomans and was sentenced to death, although this was later commuted to exile in Aleppo. He was pardoned in 1878 after independence was gained and returned to Bulgaria to become involved in the government of Eastern Rumelia, taking on a number of roles including Minister of Finance for the region. As governor of the Bulgarian National Bank from 1883 onwards he became recognized as one of the country's leading economic minds and was eventually appointed Finance Minister in the government of Vasil Radoslavov in 1886. In this role, and subsequent spells as Finance Minister, he tended to follow protectionism in order to build up Bulgaria's fairly backward economy. However he was opposed to the policies of Stefan Stambolov, at the time one of the country's regents, and resigned in 1887, largely over the pro-Austria-Hungary stance of Stambolov. After a break from political life, he returned as Finance Minister in the government of Konstantin Stoilov in 1894, a position he held for three years. In 1901 he became President of the Sabranie (Assembly) and that same year was elected leader of the People's Party, following the death of Stoilov. In 1908, he took part in the so called \\"Geshoff incident\\". Geshov finally formed a government on 29 March 1911, heading a moderate coalition of nationalists and Stoyan Danev's Russophile faction. As Prime Minister he supported the introduction of the proportional representation electoral system. He also supported the policy of working through the Balkan League and led the country through the First Balkan War against Ottoman Empire. However, he resigned on 30 May 1913, the day that the Treaty of London was signed to end the War, as he opposed the Tsar's policy of making war on the Balkan League allies. Despite this, it had been Geshov's government that gave the Tsar the power to sign treaties in the first place. Geshov remained in politics as a member of the parliament, joining the Democratic Party in 1923 after the fall of the government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski, but he played no further roles in government. Outside politics he fulfilled a number of roles, including editor of the Maritsa newspaper, founder of the Study Society and the Scientific and Literary Society and chairman of the Bulgarian Red Cross (1899-1924) and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1911-1924).

It is produced by Evoca Drinks, a London-based soft drinks company, and is sold in the United Kingdom, The Channel Islands, Europe and the Far East. History Evoca Drinks was established in May 2003 in the United Kingdom and launched its flagship product, Evoca Cola, in January 2004. Evoca Cola was the first and still is the only cola in the world to contain a tasteless extract of black seed (Nigella sativa). After initial piloting in London, it was advertised on cable channels with its 'Power of Black Seed' and 'The Original Black Seed Cola' slogans. It relaunched its brand in June 2005 to challenge global soft drink manufacturers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola with its own 'Evoca Taste Challenge'. Although Evoca Cola is very similar in taste to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, it differs in its composition by being made with natural mineral water and with the addition of a special tasteless black seed extract. Evoca Cola launched its new television advertising campaign airing on cable/sky channels. The adverts drew comparisons with Red Bull animated adverts. Brand Ambassadors have previously been a number of British, English and Commonwealth boxing champions including Danny Williams and Adnan Amar. The association with boxing and sports came about due to the tagline 'Evoca Cola - The Power Of Black Seed' alluding to the supposed benefits of the added ingredient. Market Positioning In the UK Evoca Cola faced challenges from other brand competitors such as Virgin Cola but retained a presence in the market with a consistent client base due to its claims to hold a solid commitment to adhere to an 'exemplary level of quality, in its composition and taste' . Vendors of the cola have highlighted the presence of black seed, as black seed is well known in a number of different cultures for its alleged benefits. It has largely growing mainstream appeal as a result of its unique composition among rival brands (it is sold nationally in UK Asda stores), choosing to highlight USP's such as the use of 100% mineral water and natural ingredients only, subsequently positioning itself as an 'Ultra Premium Soft Drinks Brand'. Other cola companies historically have never discussed or focused on the actual ingredients used in their colas, and what was inside the drink was always a 'trade secret', whilst focus was put almost exclusively on the image of the brands themselves. Evoca Cola tried to draw consumer attention to the quality aspects of the actual ingredients used to make the drink itself (a unique positioning among carbonated soft drinks - one would expect this from functional sports beverages for example) as they realised that this was the only way to attract customers who were used to drinking the market leading brands, by the proposition that they are claiming to offer a higher quality alternative to the market leaders.

A recent Wall Street Journal review found that there were 1,400 pipeline spills and accidents in the U.S. 2010‚Äì2013. According to the Journal review, four in every five pipeline accidents are discovered by local residents, not the companies that own the pipelines. * 1965 (March 4) A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure. * 1999 (June 10) An Olympic gasoline pipeline ruptured near Bellingham, Washington, resulting in 3 deaths: a fly fisherman and two 10-year-old boys. The cause was a series of errors and malfunctions in relief systems and process control computer systems in the Olympic Pipeline system, resulting in 277,000 gallons of gasoline spilled to Whatcom Creek. The fire burned for five days.Olympic Pipeline explosion * 2000 (19 August) A 30-inch El Paso Energy natural gas pipeline exploded, killing twelve people in southeast New Mexico. They were camping under a bridge which carried the pipeline across the Pecos River. The explosion occurred underground on the east side of the river 200 to 300 yards from the campers around 5:30 a.m.. The explosion left a crater 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The fireball was visible 20 miles north in Carlsbad, N.M. The pipeline was installed in 1950. * 2004 (May 24) A pinhole-sized leak caused by wear unleashed thousands of gallons of gasoline that fueled the BP / Olympic pipeline fire and explosion near the Westfield Shoppingtown Southcenter in Renton, Washington. The blaze sent three firefighters to the hospital, and a mile-square area, which included a nearby fire station, was cordoned off. The leak occurred in a half-inch-wide tube of stainless steel that Olympic operators use to extract fuel samples from the system's 16-inch-wide main line. A metal electrical conduit had rubbed against the stainless steel sampling tube to open the pinhole leak. * 2010 (September 9) The San Bruno pipeline explosion: At 6:11 PM, a PG&E; 30-inch natural gas line exploded in San Bruno, California, killing 8. Eyewitnesses reported the initial blast \\"had a wall of fire more than 1,000 feet high\\".San Bruno Explosion: Photos Of The Fire's Aftermath Paint A Bigger Picture. Huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved on November 8, 2011 * 2010 (July 25) The Kalamazoo River oil spill: Crude oil pipeline ruptures near Marshall, Michigan, spilling over 840,000 gallons of oil into the Kalamazoo River * 2012 (12 December) a 20-inch transmission line owned by NiSource Inc., parent of Columbia Gas, exploded, leveling 4 houses, between Sissonville and Pocatalico in Kanawha County, West Virginia (WV). When it blew, nobody at pipeline operator, Columbia Gas Transmission knew it. An 800' section of I-77 was obliterated. \\"The fire melted the interstate and it looked like lava, just boiling.\\" Later the West Virginia Public Service Commission released several pages of violations by Columbia Gas. Forty families were \\"impacted\\" by the explosion. The investigation cited \\"external corrosion\\" as the cause of the blast. * 2013 (29 March) ExxonMobil pipeline carrying Canadian Wabasca heavy crude from the Athabasca oil sands ruptured in Mayflower, Arkansas, about 25 miles northwest of Little Rock. Approximately 12,000 barrels (1,900 m3) of oil mixed with water had been recovered by March 31. Twenty-two homes were evacuated.[1] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified the leak as a major spill. A reported 5,000‚àí7,000 barrels of crude were released. * 2013 (20 August) Explosion of a natural gas pipeline near Kiowa southwest of Oklahoma City * 2013 (8 October) Explosion of a natural gas pipeline near Rosston, Oklahoma. * 2014 (Jan 25) A Trans Canada pipeline about 15 miles south of Winnipeg ruptured and exploded. The incident prompted the precautionary closure of two nearby pipelines. The pipelines supply the main source of natural gas to more than 100,000 Xcel Energy customers in eastern North Dakota, northwestern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. The explosion happened near Otterburne, Manitoba, about 15 miles south of the provincial capital, Winnipeg. The area was evacuated as a precaution. No injuries were reported but the fire burned for more than 12 hours. * 2014 (Feb) In Knifely, Adair County, Kentucky, a Columbia Gulf gas pipeline exploded at 1 a.m. flattening homes, burning barns, and causing one casualty. The 30-inch natural gas pipeline was about 100 feet from Highway 76 and buried 30 feet underground. When it exploded, large rocks and sections of pipeline flew into the air, leaving a 60-foot crater. Columbia Gulf, part of NiSource‚Äôs Columbia Pipeline Group, owns and operates more than 15,700 miles of natural gas pipelines, one of the largest underground storage systems in North America. The pipeline that exploded was carrying natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico to New York. * 2014 (Feb 11) A Hiland gas pipeline exploded about six miles south of Tioga, North Dakota. Hiland was \\"blowing\\" hydrates, ice-like solids formed from a mixture of water and gas that can block pipeline flow, out of the pipeline. * 2014 (Mar 14) A Northern Natural Gas Company pipeline erupted near the intersection of county roads 20 and O, about six miles north of Fremont, Nebraska. A company spokesman said, \\"In the summer you can tell if you've got a gas leak by vegetation, sometimes it dies in the ground.\\" * 2014 (May 26) A Viking gas pipeline explosion near Warren, Minnesota shot a fireball over 100 feet in the air. Roads within a two-mile radius were blocked off. Authorities suspected natural causes because there was still frost in the ground and the soil was wet. * 2017 (November 16) TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline leaked 5,000 barrels of crude oil in Marshall County in northeastern South Dakota. Officials don't believe the leak affected any surface water bodies or threatened any drinking water systems. * 2018 (June 7) A landslide caused a newly installed natural gas pipeline to rupture and explode in Marshall County, WV along TransCanada‚Äôs Midstream Pipeline at 4:20 a.m., releasing $437,250 worth of natural gas. Flames from the ruptured pipeline were visible for miles, but no one was injured in the explosion. * 2018 (September 13) Suspected over-pressurization of natural gas pipes by Columbia Gas caused multiple explosions and fires in 3 towns in Massachusetts (Andover, Lawrence, and North Andover), leaving 1 dead. * 2019 (October) the Keystone pipeline ruptured causing over 383,000 gallons of oil to contaminate surrounding wetlands in North Dakota. By mid-November, state regulators raised the reported acreage of contaminated land to about 209,100 square feet of wetlands.(North Dakota) https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/01/keystone-pipeline-leak- oil-spilled-north-dakota/4121954002/ * 2019 (August 1) An Enbridge natural gas pipeline ruptured causing a massive explosion in Lincoln County, Kentucky, leaving 1 person dead and 5 hospitalized.

His skills as a painter are not widely praised by art historians, but his confidence and assertiveness secured him numerous commissions for portraits. Early life Worsdale was born in poverty. His father was a pigment grinder, and James began work as an apprentice to leading portraitist Godfrey Kneller. However, Kneller fired Worsdale for secretly marrying his niece. Worsdale would claim to be Kneller's son-in-law, then Kneller's actual son, but these were impositions. Career In 1734 he must have been moving in literary circles, because he painted the portraits of Thomas Southerne and Beau Nash. In 1735, he moved to Dublin, Ireland and became the confidante and companion of Richard Parsons, 1st Earl of Rosse and Lord Blayney. The three of them formed the Hellfire Club, Dublin. Worsdale also helped form the Hell Fire Club of Limerick. He began \\"writing\\" plays and acting in them in Dublin at this time, if not earlier. He acted with the company of Smock Alley from 1737‚Äì40, with the only documented performance being as Lady Scardale in his own play, The Assembly. From 1740-44, he acted with the Aungier Street company, and he was made a deputy Master of the Revels in Ireland in 1741. He appeared as the queen in his The Queen of Spain in 1744 and as Manly in his Cure for a Scold (written in 1735 from Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew). He was (from 1733) an acquaintance of Matthew and Laetitia Pilkington, and Laetitia wrote a fiery prologue for Cure for a Scold. He moved to London off and on, where he remained in the company of Matthew Pilkington and continued to act and paint portraits for substantial commissions. In 1752 he appeared, again as a woman, as Lady Pentweazle in Taste and received the third night author's benefit. In reality, his literary productions were generally not his own. Rather, he purchased them from needy authors, including Henry Carey. Worsdale appeared on the stage with numerous ballad operas and operas, as well as poems (many of which Laetitia Pilkington sold to him). The Extravagant Justice and Gasconado the Great were two of \\"his\\" operas in 1759. Death He died in London on 19 June 1767, aged 75, and was buried in St. Paul's, Covent GardenLibrary of Ireland website biography, notes, relies on Dictionary of Irish Artists (1913) On his tombstone was inscribed his epitaph, written by himself: ::Eager to get, but not to keep, the pelf, ::A friend to all mankind except himself. In his will, Worsdale left money to five acknowledged bastards, as well as to a lady to give her independence from her husband. He had, throughout his adult life, been as flamboyantly philandering as he could and had enjoyed his reputation as a rake. Laetitia Pilkington's Memoir gives a scathing account of him, and other memoirists record him as a short, unseemly man whose whole skill was in pretence and bravado.

The mall is located in Panthapath, near Kawran Bazar, and was opened to the public on 6 August 2003. The building complex is 19 stories tall and covers an area of , making it the second largest shopping mall in Bangladesh. It is also one of the largest shopping malls in South Asia, with up to 50,000 visitors each day, The mall has space for 2,325 retail stores and cafeterias. It features a large underground gymnasium, a Star Cineplex cinema, a penthouse food court, an ice skating rink, a theme park, a fitness club, and a swimming pool. It also includes the 19-story corporate offices of the Bashundhara Group. The fully air-conditioned shopping mall with rooftop gardens is considered a modern symbol of the emerging city of Dhaka. It is the first modern mall in the city, designed by the principal architect Mustapha Khalid Palash and Mohammad Foyez Ullah of Vistaara. Construction Construction started in 1998 under Shafiat Sobhan, the vice-chairman of the Bashundhara Group. The cost of the building was more than BDT100 million. 2009 fire On 13 March 2009, the top floors of the Bashundhara City complex caught on fire. The blaze started around 1:30 pm, after Friday prayers, on one of the top floors. Most of the offices were empty, as Friday is the first day of the weekend in Bangladesh. A security guard died as he jumped off the top of the building to escape the fire and seventeen other people were injured. The chief security officer of the building was rescued from the rooftop by a Bangladesh Air Force Bell 212 helicopter. Later that day, reports announced the deaths of three more people found in an elevator by a group of fire fighters and the number of injured people climbed to fifty. Most of the injuries were caused by smoke inhalation. The fire took six hours to be brought under control due to the strong summer winds. The city's mayor, Sadeque Hossain Khoka, ordered all the fire services in the capital to the scene and requested assistance from army personnel. The fire attracted thousands of onlookers outside the complex from Panthapath to Hatirpool, causing heavy traffic. The fire was extinguished after nearly ten hours. Most of the victims who died were employees, and most of the shoppers were unharmed. The mall was closed for two days and was once again opened to the public on 16 March. According to the mall authorities, damages reached Tk2 billion (US$29m). Minister of Home Affairs Tanjim Ahmad Sohel ordered a three- member committee to review the incident. He proclaimed the damage was caused due to the lack of fire-protection equipment during the time of the incident. Gallery File:Bashundhara City (Day) (3102376006).jpgDome of Bashundhara City Mall.

Wide metal bonding straps around the joints of a radio antenna mast. Bonding \\"Bonding\\" is a method by which all electrically conductive materials and metallic surfaces of equipment and structures, not normally intended to be energized, are effectively connected with a low impedance path to avoid any appreciable potential difference between any separate points. Bonding ensures that all surfaces accessible to a person are at the same potential, reducing the hazard of an electric shock. A bonded system is not necessarily connected to earth, for example, in an aircraft. The common way to effectively bond different metallic surfaces of enclosures, electrical equipment, pipes, tubes or structures together is with a copper conductor, rated lugs and appropriate bolts, fasteners or screws. Other bonding means between different metallic parts and pieces might employ brackets, clamps, exothermic bonds or welds to make effective connections. Effectively bonded equipment can also safely conduct phase-to-ground fault currents, induced currents, surge currents, lightning currents or transient currents during abnormal conditions. Bonding jumpers must be sized to safely handle the anticipated fault current. Applications Rules for bonding jumper installation are given in electrical code regulations. Typically, these require a jumper at any place where the continuity of a bonding system might be interrupted, for example, where metallic conduits join an enclosure through fittings that do not assure good electrical contact. Peter J. Schram, Mark W. Earley, Electrical Installations in Hazardous Locations, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 1997, , page 44 Some codes require a bonding jumper to be pulled into non-metallic conduit or in electrical metallic tubing that may be exposed to corrosion or mechanical damage. In North American electrical codes, an important bonding jumper is found in main electrical panels, where the system neutral conductor is connected to earth ground. This must be done at only one point in each separately derived system to prevent flow of objectionable current in the earth. Bonding jumpers may be installed wherever metal parts are free to move on a hinge or bearing. This is done for electrical safety grounding, static electricity protection, and may also be useful for control of electromagnetic interference. For example, a control panel door may have a bonding jumper across the hinges so that the metal door is effectively connected to ground, since the hinges may not provide a reliable contact. Temporary bonding jumpers are used in the handling of flammable liquids and gases, so that static charge on a vehicle or portable tank does not ignite escaping gas.

History The Holy Fire was formed in 2004 after a studio session that produced the group's debut self-titled EP. Reviewing the band's debut EP, Real Detroit Weekly wrote, \\"This EP redefines what a Detroit rock band should sound like,\\" while Punk Planet gave the EP high praise. Alternative Press also praised the EP, comparing it to Husker Du and Jawbox. In 2006, The Holy Fire signed to the Sony/BMG-distributed southern California label The Militia Group. Their second EP In the Name of the World was released on February 21, 2006 and produced by The Flaming Lips bassist Michael Ivins. The band broke up after playing South By Southwest during their 2006 tour to support the EP. Two months prior to their breakup, the band had been featured on the cover of Detroit's Metro Times. All Music Guide's James Christopher Monger gave the In The Name of the World EP the following review: \\"Melodic post-rockers the Holy Fire followed up their independent 2004 debut EP with another EP, this time for the Southern California indie imprint The Militia Group. Produced by Flaming Lip Michael Ivins, In the Name of the World is tightly wound, emotive, and succinct in its commercial aspirations without sacrificing any of the Detroit collective's signature volatility. Ivins, a bass player by trade, has fortified the songs' foundations in a way that allows each track to succeed on both a musical and muscular level, allowing standout cuts like \\"Bombs in the Distance\\" and \\"Raised on Planes\\" the room to pound away at the skull before engaging the brain. Vocalist/guitarist Sean Hoen channels everyone from Jeremy Enigk to Robin Zander, giving a lyric like \\"Kiss me right here with your mouth/All sick from smoke and beer\\" a necessary dose of desperation and transcendence, the latter of which the Holy Fire seemed destined to achieve.\\" The band performed concerts with a number of indie acts, including: TV on the Radio, The Constantines, and Metric. The Holy Fire included members of Leaving Rouge and the late hardcore band Thoughts of Ionesco. Members went on to play in Your Skull My Closet.

It formed out of a poorly organized tropical disturbance over the southwest Gulf of Mexico late on August 31, 1998. Tracking towards the northeast, the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane on September 2 and made landfall early the next day near Panama City, Florida. Rapidly tracking towards Atlantic Canada, the extratropical remnants of Earl significantly intensified before passing over Newfoundland on September 6\\\\. The remnants were absorbed by former Hurricane Danielle two days later. Moderate beach erosion occurred along the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida as waves reached . Throughout Florida, nearly 2,000 homes were damaged and a few were destroyed. Severe flooding caused by storm surge and heavy rains was the main cause of damage in the state. Offshore, two men drowned after their boat capsized during the storm. A minor tornado outbreak took place in relation to Earl in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A tornado in South Carolina killed one person after completely destroying the occupant's home. In all, three people were killed by Earl and damages were $79 million (1998 USD; $104.4 million 2009 USD). Meteorological history Hurricane Earl originated out of a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 17\\\\. By August 23, a weak area of low pressure developed within the wave and well-developed convective activity was present as it tracked through the Lesser Antilles. Once in the Caribbean Sea, strong wind shear produced by the outflow of Hurricane Bonnie inhibited further development of the system. As it remained well-defined, satellites easily followed the low pressure into the Gulf of Mexico. By August 31, the storm had become sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Five. At this time, the depression was located roughly halfway between Merida and Tampico, Mexico. Operationally, the NHC immediately classified the system as Tropical Storm Earl based on a Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance mission that found flight-level winds of 49 mph (79 km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Due to the existence of multiple circulation centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement. In post-season analysis, it was determined that the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575 miles (925 km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of circulation several times before focusing on the true circulation center. By September 1, the storm began to consolidate, with reconnaissance flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective development in the western portion; however, outflow in other areas of the storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a mid-tropospheric ridge located over Florida, strengthened. Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify as the center of circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on the storm that Earl did not appear to be fully tropical due to the lack of organization. Around 1200 UTC on September 2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center. Hurricanes Danielle and Earl on September 3 Several hours after becoming a hurricane, Earl further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale; this observation was based on a flight- level winds of 119 mph (192 km/h), which corresponded to surface winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). The storm did not feature an eye or partial eyewall. The central barometric pressure continued to fall despite the fact that the storm was beginning to weaken. Around 0000 UTC on September 3, the central pressure decreased to 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg); however, winds also decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h). As Earl neared landfall, cloud tops significantly warmed, indicating weakening, and the overall structure of the storm became less organized. Around 0600 UTC (1:00 am EDT) on September 3, Hurricane Earl made landfall near Panama City, Florida with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Shortly after landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical storm and rapidly accelerated as it quickly underwent an extratropical transition. By this time the NHC issued their final advisory on Earl. Several hours later, Earl finished its transition and continued to rapidly track through the Southeast United States. After entering the Atlantic Ocean, the remnants of Earl began re-intensify due to the effects of a baroclinic zone. Relatively cool sea surface temperatures near Atlantic Canada prevented tropical development; however, during a 36-hour span, Earl rapidly intensified, as the central barometric pressure decreased by 40 mbar (hPa; 1.18 inHg) to 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg). By the time the system made landfall over eastern Newfoundland, sustained winds had intensified to 65 mph (100 km/h). On September 8, the remnants of Earl significantly weakened and were soon absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Danielle. Preparations Earl upon being upgraded to a hurricane on September 2 As Earl tracked towards the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 1, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Cameron, Louisiana. Additionally, hurricane watches extended out to Destin, Florida and High Island, Texas from the edges of the warning respectively. Early the next day, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Destin, Florida. In response to the eastward movement of the hurricane, the hurricane watch and warning was discontinued for areas west of Morgan City, Louisiana. Additionally, the hurricane warning was extended eastward to Destin, Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued east of Destin to Apalachicola, Florida, and a tropical storm watch was declared for areas between Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana. Several hours later, the hurricane warning was again extended eastward to the mouth of the Suwannee River. All watches and warnings were discontinued for areas west of Pascagoula, Mississippi and due to the asymmetrical structure of Hurricane Earl, a tropical storm warning was issued as far south as the Florida Keys. Continuing uncertainty in the track of Earl prompted the issuance of a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Grand Isle, Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. After Earl made landfall in Florida, all watches and warnings were discontinued in relation to the storm. Offshore, several oil and natural gas rigs were evacuated due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to protect them from the storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September 2, the reasons for the lifting of the order are unknown. State parks along the Florida Panhandle were also closed and highways became congested with thousands of residents and tourists evacuating the barrier islands. Along the Louisiana coastline, voluntary evacuation orders were given out. A state of emergency was declared for portions of southeast Louisiana as tides in relation to the storm were forecast to reach . Emergency shelters were opened throughout Plaquemines Parish, schools were closed in many areas, and the floodgates around New Orleans were shut. An estimated 5,000 people evacuated to inland areas throughout Louisiana. In Nueces County, Texas, work crews worked quickly to clear garbage along the streets and picked up trash cans to avoid possible problems with clogged drains. Throughout the Alabama and Mississippi coasts, schools were closed due to the storm. Impact Throughout the Southeast United States, Hurricane Earl killed three people and caused $79 million (1998 USD; $104.4 million 2009 USD) in damages. =Florida= Rainfall totals from Earl Ahead of Hurricane Earl's landfall in Florida, several tornadoes were spawned along the outer bands of the storm. The first tornado to touch down was a brief F0 that caused no known damage. The second tornado, rated F1, caused moderate damage to three homes and two buildings that were under- construction along its path. During a 15-minute span, three brief F0 tornadoes touched down in unpopulated areas, causing minor tree damage. Several hours later, a strong F1 tornado touched down in Port Canaveral. The tornado damaged 14 cars, eight condominiums, four businesses, a mobile home, and a fire station. In all, the tornado caused $6 million in damages and injured one person. On St. George Island, an F1 tornado damaged six homes, leaving $150,000 in damages. High waves, estimated at caused a boat to capsize off the coast of Panama City, drowning both occupants. Flooding in Navarre Beach, Florida Upon making landfall in Florida early on September 3, Earl produced a storm surge up to in the Big Bend, inundating coastal communities. Torrential rains, peaking at around Panama City, fell throughout the Florida Panhandle. Significant beach erosion was recorded in Walton County, Carrabelle Beach and Alligator Point. The most extensive damage occurred in Bay County where 1,112 structures damaged by flooding and three were destroyed. In Panama City, upwards of of water flooded homes. An estimated 7,100 residents in Bay County lost power during the storm. Florida officials temporarily shut down numerous major roadways, including State Road 77 due to high water. Portions of two roads in coastal Liberty County were destroyed due to beach erosion. In Gulf County, 300 homes were damaged by high winds and floodwaters. An estimated 8,700 people lost power in the county during the storm. At Port St. Joe, Earl's storm surge inundated 14 businesses and caused a water main break in the Lighthouse Utilities facility. In Franklin County, storm surge damaged 136 homes and 15 businesses and led to a temporary closure of the St. George Causeway. A lighthouse on St. George Island was also destroyed by the storm. At least 50 people were stranded in Alligator Point after floodwaters washed out the main access route to the town. In Wakulla County, 216 homes and businesses were damaged by high winds and flooding. Severe flooding in coastal Taylor County caused significant damage in nine communities. County officials reported that 66 structures were damaged by Earl. Five homes were destroyed and 39 others were damaged by flooding in Dixie County. In Highlands County, one person was injured after being struck by lightning. On September 3, the strongest tornado spawned by Earl in Florida touched down in Citrus County. Rated F2, the tornado tracked for , destroying eight homes and damaging 24 others. Several trees and power lines were also downed. Two people were injured in one of the destroyed homes and damages from the tornado amounted to $500,000. In all, Hurricane Earl killed two people and caused $73 million (1998 USD; $96.5 million 2009 USD) in Florida. =Southeastern U.S.= Tropical Storm Earl shortly before becoming extratropical In Louisiana, moderate beach erosion occurred as tides reached above mean sea level. Rainfall was relatively light, peaking around in Morgan City, as only the outer bands of Earl affected the state. The highest winds occurred along the coast, with sustained winds reaching 30 mph (45 km/h) and gusts reaching in Venice, Louisiana. Only minimal damage resulted from the storm in Louisiana, with monetary losses amounting to $32,000. However, losses due to the large- scale evacuation of oil and natural gas rigs was estimated to be several million dollars. Earl had limited impacts in Mississippi, with only areas along the immediate coast recording tropical storm-force wind gusts. In Alabama, Earl produced moderate rainfall, with areas along the Georgia state line receiving more than . Despite the center of Earl passing close to the state, winds were only recorded up to 40 mph (65 km/h), resulting in scattered power outages and downed trees. Portions of Alabama State Route 28 were temporarily shut down due to debris covering the road. In all, damages in the state amounted to $120,000. Ahead of Earl, an onshore flow related to the storm produced swells along the Georgia coast, causing significant damage to marinas. The Mar Lin Marina sustained the most damage from this event; all the docks were destroyed, 30 boats were damaged and six were destroyed. Damages to the marina and boats amounted to $1.3 million. Heavy rains fell throughout central areas of the state, with the highest amounts nearing . Because Earl rapidly weakened upon landfall, the highest winds in Georgia only reached . Numerous trees and power lines were downed, resulting in scattered power outages. Throughout Georgia, an estimated 10,400 people lost power due to Earl. Several streets were flooded due to the rains, resulting in traffic accidents. One tornado was spawned by Earl in Georgia; rated F2 on the Fujita scale, the tornado tracked for in Screven County. Estimated at in width, the tornado destroyed five mobile homes and a business, severely damaged 15 additional mobile homes and caused some damage to five others. Seven people were injured by the tornado and damages amounted to $435,000. Several major highways were temporarily closed due to high water or debris covering the road. Numerous homes sustained damage from fallen trees in several counties. In all, damages from Earl amounted to $2.3 million in Georgia. The extratropical remnants of Earl over the Southeast The extratropical remnants continued through the Southern United States, tracking through the Carolinas late on September 3\\\\. Sustained winds in South Carolina reached 50 mph (85 km/h) and gusted up to 70 mph (110 km/h). Widespread rainfall, generally amounting between , fell in areas previously saturated by Hurricane Bonnie, this triggered minor flooding along roads. Inland, isolated amounts of of rain fell. The first tornado related to Earl touched down in Choppee, located in Georgetown County. The tornado was rated F0 and was only briefly on the ground before it dissipated. The second tornado to touch down in the state was also the strongest in relation to Earl. Rated F2, the tornado tracked for through Beaufort and Colleton Counties, destroying 13 homes and damaging 13 others. One mobile home was flipped in the air and was completely destroyed once it hit the ground, instantly killing the occupant of the home. Numerous trees were uprooted and snapped along its path. In all, the tornado killed one person, injured four others and caused $360,000 in damages. A brief F1 tornado touched down several hours later, damaging the roof of a barn and uprooting several trees before dissipating. The most damaging tornado spawned by Earl was a wide, F2 tornado that struck the Fairlawn subdivision near Moncks Corner. Along the tornado's track, 21 homes were destroyed and 73 others were damaged. Nine people sustained injuries due to the tornado and damages amounted to $2.8 million. Locations of tornadoes spawned by Earl Still recovering from Hurricane Bonnie, the remnants of Earl produced widespread rain over North Carolina, triggering flooding. Upwards of fell in localized areas, causing small streams to overflow their banks. In Union County, up to 15 roads were shut down due to flooding, a few cars were also washed off roads at the height of the floods. In Charlotte, several roads were flooded. The Carteret Community College, which was severely damaged by Bonnie, was again damaged by Earl. High winds from the storm damaged temporary protective measures, allowing rain to flood the interior of the building, causing water damage to the structure and materials inside. In front of the Crystal Coast Civic Center, fabriform, installed to stabilize the beach, was damaged by the storm, resulting in significant beach erosion. Two short lived tornadoes touched down in North Carolina from Earl. The first, an F0, damaged at least 15 mobile homes, overturned sheds, destroyed a porch and two campers. No injuries resulted from the tornado and damage amounted to $50,000. The second and stronger of the two tornadoes, rated F1, only touched down for a few seconds; however, it destroyed one home and severely damaged a neighboring home. According to eye-witness reports, the tornado lifted the home off the ground before the home broke apart and fell to the ground. =Elsewhere= The initial tropical disturbance passed through the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 29 and inflow bands to the south of Earl continued rainfall across southeast Mexico until early September 2. The highest rainfall total was reported from Belizario Dominguez/Moto, where of precipitation fell. The extratropical remnants of Earl produced strong winds and heavy rains throughout Newfoundland and Nova Scotia on September 6. Sustained winds were recorded up to and rains totaled between throughout Newfoundland. On Nova Scotia, rainfall peaked at on Cape Breton Island. The highest recorded total on Newfoundland reached in northwestern areas of the island. Aftermath Counties in Florida declared disaster areas On September 4, President Bill Clinton approved disaster declarations for six counties in Florida. Bay, Dixie, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, and Wakulla counties were approved for Individual Assistance. Residents in the designated counties were eligible to receive federal funding for three months following the storm. By September 8, State Farm had received 200 auto and 720 homeowners claims from the affected region, most of which were partial damage claims. Allstate had received 80 auto and 587 homeowners claims from Florida and 540 claims from Georgia. Additionally, Nationwide reported that up to 1,000 claims had been filed from Florida. Following the impacts of Hurricane Opal in 1995, Earl and later Hurricane Georges, the state of Florida undertook a recovery project to restore the eroded beaches along the Panhandle coast. In October United States Department of Transportation provided $2 million in funds to repair damaged and destroyed roads in Florida. On December 3, an additional $1.7 million was provided to repair funds. The United States Military allocated $2.2 million to repair damage from Hurricane Earl to training academies and naval ports. The Florida Senate provided $25,740 in emergency funds to Hurricane Earl victims. By the end of the disaster declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $1 million in public assistance and $600,000 in disaster mitigation.

It is administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The tower was built on Bowman's Hill, which is on the Upper Makefield Township side of the border between itself and Solebury Township. The tower was erected in the 1930s as a memorial. The tower Construction on Bowman's Hill Tower began in 1929 and was completed in 1931. It stands 125 feet tall and its base measures 24 feet on a side. The tower was constructed from native stone quarried from Bowman's Hill and nearby stone fences. Quarries in Lumberville, Pennsylvania and Lawrenceville, New Jersey provided cut stone to be used for the sills and balustrades. Over of materials were used in its construction, including; 1,200 perch of stone, of sand and tons of cement. In order to provide a solid foundation for the tower, the base was excavated . The labor for the construction was provided by employees of the Washington Crossing Park Commission. Including labor, the tower cost $100,000 to build. By 1934 the Tower was struck many times by lightning which resulted in the installation of a lightning protection system by the National Lightning Protection Company of St. Louis, Missouri. During the 1930s the Civil Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration planted over 28,300 seedlings in an effort to reforest the area. A large number of erosion control measures were taken to include the setting of large numbers of rocks and boulders. Additionally, they created two vistas from the tower to the Delaware River, one on the north side of the hill and the other on the southeast side. In the 1980s the tower was extensively restored and an elevator was installed. Previously visitors climbed an open stone spiral staircase to the observation point at the top of the tower. An elevator now goes three-quarters of the way to the top and lets out onto a stone landing. Visitors must then climb a small and narrow 23-step stone spiral staircase to the tower roof. Additionally, there is a parapet over the final stairs that gives the tower its distinctive look. The park The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania created the Washington Crossing Historic Park in 1917, and then established the Washington Crossing Park Commission to administer and develop the park in 1919. The park also contains the Thompson-Neely House. The name There is no definitive source for the name Bowman, however there are several theories: # The original name was Beau Mont which was paired with Belle Mont, a similar hill in New Jersey. There was a John Beaumont who owned the original land in 1783. His tract of land can be seen in the Upper Makefield township building. # The hill was named for Thomas Bowman, an English merchant who conducted trade up and down the Delaware River in the 17th century. # The hill was named for a John Bowman, a friend of Jonathan Pidcock, the first settler in the area. Pidcock's farm was located in the northeast end of the hill, from which Revolutionary War soldiers encamped on the farm, then owned by a Robert Thompson. # Refers to a Doctor John Bowman (possibly the same John Bowman as above), allegedly ship's surgeon to Captain Kidd. Dr Bowman was thought to have retired to eastern Pennsylvania after his time at sea and is said to be buried somewhere on the hill. The legend goes on in claiming that pirate treasure may be buried on the hill. Note: a Burial placard on the hill commemorates a John Pidcock, early settler of the area, and not Dr. Bowman. The Mine In 1854, an accident led to the discovery of a mine on the west side of Bowman's hill. It was later excavated in search of copper. The supervising engineer was of the opinion that the mine was originally created by Germans. The vistas * To the east, a large American Flag can be seen over an American Revolutionary War cemetery containing the graves of 23 Continental Army soldiers, 22 of them are unknown. * The Thompson-Neely House, an 18th-century stone farmhouse with a gristmill, located down the hill and across the street (River Road) to the east. * To the northeast, the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge connecting New Hope, Pennsylvania and Lambertville, New Jersey, and the U.S. Route 202 bridge. * To the south east, Trenton, New Jersey and Morrisville, Pennsylvania. *To the south, Tullytown landfill operated by Waste Management, Inc..

Founded by Frank Washburn in 1907, the company grew to over 100,000 employees worldwide, and had over 200,000 shareholders by the mid-1970s. Its stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ACY. It was repeatedly reorganized after the mid-1990s, merged with other firms, and saw brands and divisions sold or spun off. The bulk of the former company is now part of Pfizer, with smaller portions belonging to BASF, Procter & Gamble and other firms. Although originally a manufacturer of agricultural chemicals the product line was soon broadened into many different types of industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals. The company then diversified into synthetic fibers, pharmaceuticals, surgical products, plastics, and inorganic pigments before World War II; and later added, by acquisitions, cosmetic and toiletry products, perfumes, building products, home building, and several smaller product categories following World War II. Product lines Cyanamid's pharmaceutical division included Lederle Laboratories, maker of Piperacillin, an antibiotic drug used as a penicillin substitute; Centrum, a multivitamin supplement; Stresstabs vitamins; and Orimune, an oral polio vaccine. Davis & Geck was the company's medical device operation, organized under Lederle. Its Consumer Products division included Shulton products, primarily Old Spice cologne and after-shave lotion, Breck shampoo, and Pine-Sol household cleaner. A variety of fine fragrance products were made and sold by Shulton under license, including products under labels Nina Ricci, Pierre Cardin, Tabac, and others. Melmac was Cyanamid's trademark for plastic kitchenware, although it was produced and marketed by other firms under license.  Legal issues  Cyanamid was involved in the tetracycline litigation. In its last years, the company was involved in numerous legal issues related to its earlier environmental pollution. During the 1970s, tens of millions of dollars were spent on effluent treatment ‚Äì such as a $15-million tertiary water treatment plant in Bound Brook, New Jersey, which returned to the Raritan River water that was cleaner than the river itself. Tens of millions more were spent in efforts to clean up large wastewater pools which had decades of accumulation of toxic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic chemicals. These are considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be among the most toxic chemical waste sites in the U.S. Cyanamid merged with American Home Products in 1994, and AHP changed its name to Wyeth which was then purchased by Pfizer in 2009. Responsibility for the clean-up of these sites remained with the site owner during these corporate transitions.American Cyanamid Bridgewater One-Page Summary Remediation began at Bound Brook in 2007Impoundments 14 and 20 Closure Program and Pfizer took over the site in 2009. The 575-acre Superfund site at Bound Brook-Bridgewater had a history of flooding. It was flooded in the 1930s and again in August 1971 during Hurricane Doria, at which time the plant sustained major damage to its facilities and equipment. In 2011, during Hurricane Irene the site once again flooded, but this time all manufacturing had ended and all buildings had been torn down. However, impounds and wastesites remained with consequent leakage of benzene and numerous other chemicals into the Raritan River and adjacent land, apparently including residential sites. Subsequent testing showed no evident danger to humans, but the calamity intensified the extensive cleanup work already underway and the EPA announced another remediation plan for the site in September 2012. In the United Kingdom, the company was involved in a well-known legal case, American Cyanamid Co. g N¬∞.1) v Ethicon Ltd. (1975), which set the test for awarding an interim injunction in England and Wales and set down what became known to lawyers as the American Cyanamid principles.American Cyanamid Co (No 1) v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 (05 February 1975) The American Cyanamid principles are also applied under public procurement law when the high court determines whether to lift the automatic suspension of the power to award a public contract when an application has been made to the court to challenge the lawfulness of a proposed contract award.Henderson Chambers, Group M UK Ltd. v Cabinet Office [2014] EWHC 3659 (TCC), published 17 March 2015, accessed 22 March 2016  Acquisition and breakup  The company merged with American Home Products (AHP) in 1994. At that time, the purchase price, $9.5 billion, made it the second-largest industrial acquisition in U.S. history to that point. American Home Products eventually changed its name to Wyeth Corporation (one of its subsidiaries), and in 2009 Wyeth merged with Pfizer, becoming a subsidiary of the world's largest pharmaceutical company. After the AHP acquisition, the Cyanamid conglomerate was disassembled over a period of years. The Pigments division was sold to National Lead Company. The Old Spice product line, and some others, were sold to Procter and Gamble. Formica Corporation was taken private in a management buyout, and later went through a series of ownership changes, and is currently owned by Fletcher Building, headquartered in New Zealand. The $1.7 billion agricultural business was sold in 2000 to the German chemical giant BASF, raising BASF agricultural sales to $3.6 billion (1999 pro-forma), making it one of the top three agricultural companies in the world. Most of the chemical businesses of American Cyanamid are now operated by a spun-off successor company known as Cytec. Cytec was acquired by Solvay Group in December 2015 to form the Cytec Solvay Group based in Brussels, Belgium.

History Leaving Rouge released Collected Songs shortly after the band's formation in 2002. The ten song album featured close to twenty musicians, the only constant being vocalist Sean Hoen. Prior to forming Leaving Rouge, Hoen had fronted Thoughts of Ionesco, a Detroit-based noise-core band whom Alternative Press had referred to as \\"an ultimate expression of pain-through-sound.\\" According to a 2004 article in Real Detroit Weekly, Hoen claimed his change in musical direction drew skepticism from fans of Thoughts of Ionesco, and that the band had a difficult time finding an audience. He cited the Red House Painters and Nick Drake as being primary influences for the band's sound. A self-titled EP on the Detroit label Down Peninsula Audio followed in 2003, and the band signed with Portland, OR indie label Greyday Productions in 2004. The band released a second EP titled White Houses. The EP was praised by sources as diverse as Harp Magazine and Playgirl Magazine. A second full-length album,Elsewhere, was released on March 21, 2006. A departure from the more experimental tones of White Houses, Elsewhere received mixed reviews and the band broke up before the end of the year. About the album, All Music Guide's Nick Raggett wrote, \\"As compared with the more stretched-out and reflective sound of the earlier version of the group, everything here is much more direct, aiming for play on a radio station that might not exist but probably should.\\" He went on the say that, \\"The majestic \\"Sleep Now Forever,\\" with some absolutely gorgeous guitar figures in particular, is the pick of the album. If there's something odd about Elsewhere it might be its mix -- often it almost sounds like a muddy cassette-copy of a clearer master, or as if it should be in the background of a movie scene. It's not constant, though, and with time it sounds more like the artistic choice it was clearly meant to be.\\" Hoen and Leaving Rouge member Nick Marko played concurrently in The Holy Fire from 2003-2006. The band was signed to California indie label The Militia Group. During this time Leaving Rouge was largely a side project. During its career, Leaving Rouge opened for Ted Leo, The Appleseed Cast, The Constantines, Kings of Convenience, Karate, and several other \\"indie\\" acts. Leaving Rouge, however, would never perform outside of Michigan. In 2007, Hoen would release a full-length album The Liquor Witch under the name Sean Madigan Hoen.

Cuza (8 November 1857 ‚Äì 3 November 1947), also known as A. C. Cuza, was a Romanian far-right politician. Early life Born in Ia≈üi, Cuza attended secondary school in his native city and in Dresden, then studied law at the University of Paris, the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Berlin, and the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. He took doctorates in political science and economy (1881), as well as law (1882). Upon his return to Romania, Cuza became active in the socialist circle formed around Constantin Mille. He attended meetings of the Junimea literary society, contributing to its magazine Convorbiri Literare. In 1890, he engaged in the political aspect of Junimea, serving briefly as deputy mayor of Ia≈üi; in 1892, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (serving until 1895). Cuza moved on to the Conservatives, and was yet again deputy ‚Äì until a split generated by his virulent antisemitism. He briefly managed to achieve international prominence, after organizing the Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle (\\"Universal Antisemitic Alliance\\") in Bucharest (1895). Romania in Cuza's time was one of the most Francophile nations in the entire world and the Romanian intelligentsia tended to be powerfully influenced by intellectual currents from France. One particular French intellectual fascinated Cuza, namely Comte Arthur de Gobineau whose theories of an ancient Aryan \\"master race\\" that created European civilization and of subsequent racial degeneration caused by miscegenation formed the basis of all of Cuza's thinking about race. Cuza's thesis about the Jews as the \\"plague\\" upon Romania were based upon Gobineau's theories, but Cuza elaborated by presenting Jews as a biologically different \\"race\\" were poisoning Romania by their sheer existence. Cuza created a distinctly new Antisemitism that merged traditional Eastern Orthodox anti- Semitism with modern pseudo-scientific Antisemitism to create a new type of Antisemitism that the Israeli historian Jean Ancel called \\"Christian racist\\" Antisemitism.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 pages 10‚Äì11. Unlike the v√∂lkisch anti- Semitics in Germany-many, but not all of whom were indifferent, if not actively hostile to Christianity, Cuza made a point of stressing the basis of his ideology in the teachings of the Orthodox Church. At the same time, Cuza's insistence that the Jews were a biologically separate \\"race\\" meant that he rejected conversion to Orthodoxy as the solution to the \\"Jewish Question\\" as he argued that converted Jews were still racially Jews, and led him to advocate the total expulsion of all Jews from Romania as the only solution to the \\"Jewish Question\\".Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page 11. In an 1899 essay, Cuza wrote that the Jews were \\"instinctively\\" working for Romania's destruction, by which Cuza meant that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and that because of these alleged genetic reasons the Jews would not stop trying to destroy Romania. A recurring theme of Cuza's writings was that the Jews had been collectively working to ruin Christian nations, especially Romania because of what Cuza believed to be a Jewish \\"genetic code\\". With Xenopol and Iorga He decided to start his own movement, one centered on the rejection of Jews from public life. His first attempt saw him joining forces with historian A. D. Xenopol, creating Liga contra alcoolismului (\\"The League Against Alcoholism\\") and its magazine, Biblioteca Ligii contra alcoolismului. The scope of this movement went well beyond fighting addiction: Cuza and Xenopol saw the root of this social evil with Jewish entrepreneurs of the rural sphere. The League claimed that Jews were encouraging Romanian peasants to drink, in order to ensure a captive market, and even to benefit from their very ruin (by having them sign off assets in order to feed their habit). The prejudice had acquired a tradition by the turn of the century ‚Äì however, such attitudes ignored the fact that few other employments were left open for Jews, who were awarded full citizenship only after 1923. In 1901, Cuza became a professor at the University of Ia≈üi. Since his previous initiative had died out, he associated with Nicolae Iorga: after a period of publishing articles in the latter's Neamul Rom√¢nesc, he joined Iorga in the creation of the Democratic Nationalist Party (1910). In 1912, he became the editor of the Party official voice, the Unirea newspaper. Cuza showed himself in favor of replacing the restrictive framework of the Romanian state by adopting universal male suffrage, and proposed a land reform ‚Äì in which he saw an end to leasehold estates, of which Jews would have taken an undeserved profit. The latter goal brought Cuza into an alliance with General Alexandru Averescu's People's League, a populist movement of immense, albeit brief popularity (he himself wrote down the League's founding document). Prominence He broke off with Iorga and founded the more radical National Christian Union in 1922 (the new Party found inspiration in Fascism and the Blackshirts, but was not paramilitary itself). It used the swastika as its symbol ‚Äì one already connected to Anti-Semitic movements in Germany, and made himself known by supporting a Jewish quota in higher education (a demand which created a standoff with the government during a nationalist students' strike in 1923). From 1921, the swastika became the distinctive symbol of Cuza's movement, appearing in its publications, booklets and electoral programs. Cuza claimed priority and a purely Romanian character for this symbol, without in any way referring to the circulation of the swastika in Germany. > The swastika is linked to the cult of the sun. It appears in the countries > inhabited by the Pelasgic race, which we find from the very beginning in our > lands. In general, the swastika is the distinctive sign of the Aryan race, > signs were found on our soil‚Ä¶ Being here since ancient times, the swastika > therefore is, in the first place, ours, Romanian by its descent from the > Thracian Aryans‚Ä¶ The swastika is our national emblem. The cross is the > emblem of our faith, just as it is with all Christian peoples. It is only > together that the Swastika and the Cross display our entire being, our body > and soul. We are Aryans and Christians. Cuza's movement took shape in the same year, when it transformed into the \\"violently anti-Semitic\\"Radu Ioanid, The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940‚Äì1944, Ivan R. Dee, 2008, p. 63, National-Christian Defense League with the help of young Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (already a good friend of Cuza's). The purpose of the National Christian Defense League was \\"to fight with all legal means in order to support economic, political and social interests against the Jews\\". Cuza was fiercely opposed to the Minorities Treaty which finally forced Romania to grant citizenship to the Jews in 1923. It was after 1923 that Cuza abandoned his support for universal manhood suffrage as he could stated that allowing Jews the right to vote was unacceptable. Cuza stated that the solution to the \\"Jewish Question\\" was to \\"remove them from the country, after a transitional stage during which their influence on Romanian life would be eliminated\\". The steps Cuza advocated were in the \\"transitional stage\\" prior to expulsion were disemancipation, forbidding Jews to work in the public sector, separate schools for Jewish children and forbidding all Jews to live in the countryside. Unlike Codreanu, Cuza rejected violence and wanted to use only legal means. Cuza's refusal to turn the movement into a militia alienated Codreanu: in late 1927, after several attempts at imposing his line, Codreanu left in order to found the movement that would become known as the Iron Guard. Cuza's \\"Christian racist\\" anti-Semitism served was the ideological bedrock of the Iron Guard, but Codreanu added his own distinctive ideas into the \\"Christian racism\\" such as a strong element of Orthodox mysticism and making the Iron Guard into a death cult that rejected all the values of modern society.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page 12. For the Iron Guard to kill and/or to be killed in the service of the cause were the only positive values-for Codreanu nothing else mattered. In this, Codreanu differed greatly from Cuza, who much preferred to solve the \\"Jewish Question\\" via legal measures, instead of violence. The conflict between the two turned vitriolic. All major conflicts of the 1930s between Codreanu and the establishment found Cuza on the latter's side, eager to win back his movement's place as the leading Antisemitic voice. In 1935, he joined forces with Octavian Goga's National Agrarian Party, forming the new National Christian Party. In 1936, Cuza was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site After the elections of 1937, the intervention of King Carol II (a Fascist sympathizer who was however wary of the Iron Guard) brought the National Christians to government, with Goga as Prime Minister and Cuza as minister of state. Alongside the overt persecution of Jews, the government adopted Corporatism. In a paradoxical turn, Cuza agreed to have the Party turn towards paramilitary activism: his government created its answer to the armed Iron Guard, the LƒÉncieri (\\"Lance-bearers\\"). The Goga-Cuza government was not able to lift Romania from crisis: as a minority rule that was meant to satisfy the King, it only managed to alienate the public. In February 1938, after several attempts at forming a national government, Carol dismissed it and replaced it with a personal dictatorship. In 1939, Cuza held his last political post as member of the Crown Council. References * Nicholas M.

Background and education Salter was the eldest son of James Edward Salter (1857‚Äì1937) of the Thames boating company Salters Steamers, and who became Mayor of Oxford in 1909. Educated at Oxford City High School and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was a scholar, he graduated with first class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1903. Career Salter joined the Civil Service in 1904 and worked in the transport department of the Admiralty, on national insurance, and as private secretary, being promoted to Assistant Secretary grade in 1913. On the outbreak of war, he was recalled to the Admiralty, and became director of ship requisitioning. He was sent to Washington D.C. to press for a US programme of new construction. In 1917/18 he was a colleague of Jean Monnet in the Chartering Committee of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, and in 1919 appointed secretary of the Supreme Economic Council in Paris. Salter then worked as head of the economic and financial section of the League of Nations secretariat, and in the League secretariat at Geneva, where he worked for stabilization of currencies of Austria and Hungary and resettlement of refugees in Greece and Bulgaria. In the 1920s, having seen the League of Nations fail through the vested interests of individual countries, Monnet and Salter worked together to develop plans for the establishment of a ‚ÄòUnited States of Europe‚Äô, headed by an unelected technocrat government. He returned to London in 1930, and worked as journalist and author. In 1932, he presided over a Conference on Road and Rail Transport tasked with looking at the true costs and benefits of transport, and whose results were known as the Salter Report. It recommended changes to the way that public roads were funded to account for the growing demands of the motor car and road freight, and to ensure that road and rail were evenly regulated and competed fairly. After some deliberation, and receiving many protests from companies with road interests, government introduced freight licensing and the Road Fund as a direct result, so that motorists should completely cover the costs of the road network and associated costs across the economy. In 1934, he was appointed Gladstone professor of political theory and institutions at Oxford University, and a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford University from 1937‚Äì50. On outbreak of war in 1939, he resumed his role in shipping, being appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shipping. In summer 1940, he once more worked with Jean Monnet on a proposal to politically unify Britain and France as a bastion against Nazism. Whilst the paper was rejected, it reignited the possibility of pan-European government. Later, Salter headed the British shipping mission to Washington from 1941‚Äì3, where he once more came into contact with Monnet, and they worked to interest President Roosevelt in the 'European project‚Äô. These seeds would go on to bear fruit, as in 1948, the Americans would establish, and fund, the foundations of pan-European government. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1941. In 1944 he was appointed deputy director-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the short-lived Churchill caretaker ministry (May‚ÄìJuly 1945). He was elected as Conservative MP for Ormskirk from 1951‚Äì3, and served as Minister of State for Economic Affairs at the Treasury, and as Minister of Materials in 1952. Rab Butler, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, claimed that Churchill called Salter \\"the greatest economist since Jesus Christ\\".Butler 1971, p.156 Butler's biographer Anthony Howard writes that Salter was \\"never more than a minor, and sometimes visible, irritant to the new Chancellor\\".Howard 1987, p. 181 Butler called him \\"Micawber Salter\\" because of his opposition to Butler's proposal to let the pound float (\\"Operation ROBOT\\").Howard 1987, p. 187 In the mid-1950s he was invited by Nuri al-Said to be one of the external members of the Iraqi government's Development Board; while working with this board, he produced what came to be known as \\" the Salter report\\" on industrial development of the Iraqi economy. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Salter, of Kidlington in the County of Oxford, on 16 October 1953. He had received many honours during his career, being first appointed a Companion of the Bath in 1918, a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1922, and a GBE in 1944. His peerage became extinct when he died in 1975, aged 94. Bibliography * Aster, Sidney, Power, Policy and Personality: The Life and Times of Lord Salter, 1881- 1975, Amazon, 2016. .

The 2011 Census recorded the population as 408. The village is near the county boundary with Herefordshire, opposite which is the village of Welsh Bicknor. The two villages are on opposite sides of the River Wye. History The Domesday Book of 1086 records Bicknor as Bicanofre. The second morpheme of the toponym, ≈çfer, is thought to come from the Old English for river bank, referring to the two villages' positions either side of the river. Various hypotheses have been put forward for the origin of the first morpheme in the name, but may mean a place belonging to Bica. English Bicknor is one of the ancient villages of the Forest of Dean, situated at the top of a hill overlooking the Wye Valley, and once the site of English Bicknor Castle, a motte and bailey castle, the remnants of which can still be seen. Close to the village is Bicknor Court, an imposing house some 400 years old. Situated between Symond's Yat and Lower Lydbrook on high ground opposite its namesake Welsh Bicknor. English Bicknor is first recorded as a hamlet in 1066. The parish is primarily agricultural and industrial. Its main attraction is the small Norman Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin which has notable internal 12th-century stonemasonry and sculpture. The church is in the outer courtyard of the motte-and-bailey castle. Norman masonry has been found in the motte, suggesting at least part was built in stone. Nothing of the castle's structure survives, but its location remains identifiable. A typical early Norman defence work which is one of many along the Welsh Marches, it is thought to have been built in the reign of Henry I of England (1100‚Äì35) or King Stephen (1135‚Äì54) and was demolished or destroyed by the late 14th century, but why and how is not known (possibly during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr). Parish church 15th-century ledger stone in St Mary's inscribed with Lombardic script The parish church is Norman, built in the 12th century. It is in an oval churchyard of Anglo-Saxon origin within the outer courtyard of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. The exterior walls were restored in the Victorian era. Only the exterior stonework of the 13th-century west tower is original. Earlier the church had a crossing tower, but was it built from the soft local sandstone which became unsafe. Inside the church, both the four-bay north arcade and five-bay south arcade are Norman Romanesque, but their capitals have different decoration. The font is also Norman. The church has also a stained glass window made by Percy Bacon in 1908. Monuments in the church include a ledger stone from about 1420 with a rare example of Lombardic script that translates \\"Pray for the soul of our departed brother in Christ\\". Other monuments include three Medi√¶val stone figures. Cecilia Muchegros, who lived in the village and died in 1301, and Hawisia, who died in 1353 and whose figure is dressed in a long flowing robe, each have a dog at their feet. The third figure is of a priest, with an old body and a young head. It is not known who he was, but may have been the priest in the church in the early 14th century. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast five bells including the tenor in 1709 and the treble bell in 1718. The church has also a Sanctus bell cast by John Warner & Sons of Cripplegate, London in 1875. St Mary's is a Grade I listed building. Governance The village is in the Christchurch and English Bicknor electoral ward. This ward centres on Christchurch but starts in the north at English Bicknor and includes Staunton Coleford in the southwest. The 2011 Census recorded the ward population as 1,520.

Biography Bennington was born in Barford, Norfolk into a musical household - his mother played melodeon and his father played the tin whistle. Bennington's first instrument was a glockenspiel, which he was given around age six. He was later given his first dulcimer by his father, who kept the King's Head public house at Barford. In 1912, Bennington went to the Hingham Show, where he heard Billy Cooper playing the dulcimer. Cooper's father was bandmaster of the Hingham and Watton band, and Bennington took lessons from him. Bennington frequently rode a bicycle with his dulcimer strapped to his back, with the ends sticking out above his shoulders. This made him look like he had wings, and so he acquired the nickname \\"the Barford Angel\\". He usually played by striking the strings with cane beaters (hammers) bound with wool, but sometimes he would pluck the strings with the nails of the first finger and thumb. On some tunes he would even combine these two techniques. He played a wide range of tunes, including hornpipes, polkas, schottisches, jigs, and marches. Bennington spent most of his life as a gardener, and continued to perform well into his eighties at local folk festivals, frequently accompanied by his wife Iris. He died in October 1986.

His research focused on the activities of multinational firms, which was the subject of his PhD dissertation The International Operations of National Firms: A Study of Direct Foreign Investment, presented in 1960, but published posthumously in 1976, by the Department of Economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Charles P. Kindleberger, his thesis supervisor, submitted it for publication, as mentioned by him on the introduction of Hymer's thesis dissertation. Personal life Hymer was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Stephen Herbert Hymer's father was a Jewish clothing store owner from Poland and his mother was the bookkeeper. This inspired him to research the impact that multinational corporations have on local enterprises, as he feared the presence of new competitors might end up affecting his family's business. Hymer received a B.A. with first-class honors in Economics and Political Science from McGill University in his native Montreal in 1955. He enrolled at MIT in the fall of that year to study industrial relations,As mentioned by Charles P. Kindleberger in the introduction of his thesis dissertation having moved to Boston where he met his wife, Gilda, also from Montreal. He taught economics at Yale University and had two sons.Christos N. Pitelis, 2002, \\"Stephen Hymer: life and the political economy of multinational corporate capital\\" From 1970 until the time of this death, Hymer worked as an economics professor at the New School for Social Research in New York.Christos N. Pitelis, 2002, \\"Stephen Hymer: life and the political economy of multinational corporate capital\\" He combined his interests in Industrial Organization and International Trade in his doctoral thesis. Hymer died after a car accident in Shandaken, New York. Contributions Stephen Hymer is considered to be the father of International Business due to his contributions related to Foreign Direct Investment as well as his studies and academic production on the field of theories of multinational enterprises. Hymer's main contributions, which predated most of today's existing theory on the subjects of multinational enterprises and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), are collected in eleven documents, including his 1960 doctoral thesis. Before his theory on FDI, all investments were considered to be mere capital movements across borders. These movements of capital were thought to be determined mainly by the differences in interest rates between the countries. Hymer established that there was a distinction between financial investments and these kinds of investments, which he named Foreign Direct Investment: the latter gives the firm control over the business activities in other countries whereas portfolio investment does not. The theory presented by Stephen Hymer is considered a departure from neo-classical perspective and the consideration of a perfect market structure. Hymer's main conclusion is that foreign direct investment can only succeed as long as there are market imperfections that can create advantages and conflicts: companies could reduce their competition by implementing foreign direct investment. In this way, companies can eliminate the arising conflicts in the market and benefit from their specific advantages. Hymer considered multinational firms to be better institutions than actual international markets in the process of stimulating business, and for information transmitting as well as price fixing. This was all elaborated by Dunning and Pitelis in the academic paper: \\"Stephen Hymer's Contribution to International Business Scholarship: An assessment and extension\\".John H Dunning and Christos N Pitelis, \\"Stephen Hymer's contribution to international business scholarship: an assessment and extension,\\" Journal of International Business Studies 39, 167-176 (January/February 2008). doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400328 In the analysis of the nature and causes of foreign investment, Hymer made a distinction between direct and portfolio investment. After ascertaining that differences in interest rates cause portfolio investments, but not direct investments, and that the industrial distribution of the latter is not significantly different from one country to another, as could be expected if their cause was solely differences in profitability, Hymer concluded that direct investments are capital movements associated to international operations of firms. Their goal is to keep control of production. This control allows either to suppress competition, or appropriate rents derived from advantages like skilled labour, cheap raw materials, access to capital markets or technology. Later, Hymer used Marxian language and concepts more explicitly.He has been described by Susan Strange as being one of the Marxists (another being Robert Rowthorn) that is read in business schools: Susan Strange, Casino Capitalism, p. 93. In a series of articles published in the 1970s, he considered the relationship between nation-states and multinational firms, detailing their role in the creation of an international division of labor. Hymer argued that this hierarchal division of labor was a macrocosm of the internal division of labor reproduced within the multinational corporation. Hymer did not believe that these firms had become more powerful than nation-states; instead, multinationals were firmly rooted in the major financial centers of the world, and they tended to reinforce existing geographic and spatial boundaries and dependencies. Papers and articles on this and various other topics articles were compiled by Hymer's graduate students from the New School for Social Research in The Multinational Corporation: A Radical Approach. Papers by Stephen Herbert Hymer, published by Cambridge University Press in 1979. Hymer's theories have strongly influenced other economists, like Cantwell and Dunning, and were elaborated by Hymer's dissertation advisor, Charles P. Kindleberger in American Business Abroad, series of lectures published in 1969. The latter played an important role in the posthumous publication of Hymer's dissertation. Many authors have used Hymer's theories to develop new theoretical approaches in the field of international business. One of these new theories is the OLI paradigm (ownership-location-internalization) also known as the eclectic paradigm, developed by John Dunning (1977), which adopts Hymer's firms' specific advantages.

He, along with Murong Wei's mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun, is often blamed for Former Yan's decline and fall. Early life Murong Ping was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, sons of the Jin vassal, the Xianbei chief Murong Hui (), the father of Former Yan's founder Murong Huang. Although historical records do not give his age, it was probably close in range to Murong Jun, Murong Huang's heir apparent. (This is corroborated in that his grandnephew Murong Wei, at one point, referred to him as an uncle rather than a granduncle, perhaps out of confusion in his young age.) It is not known who his mother was. The first reference to him in history was in 339, when he was mentioned as one of Murong Huang's generals (along with another brother, Murong Jun (, note different tone and character than his nephew who would later inherit the throne), Muyu Gen (ÊÖïËºøÊ†π), and Muyu Ni (ÊÖïËºøÊ≥•)) who conducted a successful raid against Later Zhao's border region. During Murong Jun's reign In 348, Murong Huang died, and was succeeded by his son Murong Jun, who was then still using the Jin-created title Prince of Yan. In 349, Later Zhao's emperor Shi Hu died, and his state soon fell into internecine wars between his sons and his adoptive grandson Shi Min. Murong Jun therefore decided to advance south. In Murong Jun's campaigns over the next few years, which saw him seize much of Later Zhao's territory and capture Shi Min (who had by then changed him name to Ran Min, to the family name that his father had before his adoption by Shi Hu) and destroy his short-lived state Ran Wei, Murong Ping served as a major general. Murong Ping led the army that sieged Ran Wei's capital Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei), after Ran Min's capture, in 352, against Ran Min's wife Empress Dong and son Ran Zhi, and the city fell to him, formally ending Ran Wei. He was put in charge of Yecheng's defenses. In 354, Murong Jun, who had by now completely broken from Jin and claimed imperial title, put him in charge of military operations in the Luoyang region (although Former Yan would not be able to capture Luoyang at this time) and also created him the Prince of Shangyong. Over the next few years, Murong Ping would be involved in leading armies against various former Later Zhao generals who were still trying to maintain independence and vacillating between Former Yan, Former Qin, and Jin. His campaigns were of mixed successes and failures. In 360, Murong Jun grew seriously ill, and he commissioned his capable brother Murong Ke as regent for his son Murong Wei. Murong Ping, Yang Mu (ÈôΩÈû™), and Muyu Gen were to serve as Murong Ke's assistants. Murong Jun soon died, and Murong Wei succeeded him. During Murong Ke's regency Muyu Gen, a more senior official than Murong Ke or Murong Ping, was unwilling to submit to Murong Ke, and he falsely told the young emperor and his mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun Murong Ke and Murong Ping were planning a rebellion. Empress Dowager Kezuhun believed Muyu, but the young emperor did not and refused to authorize his actions. Murong Ke soon found out and, after consulting with Murong Ping, executed Muyu and his clan. Murong Ke was clearly the regent at this point, but he consulted Murong Ping on all major decisions. His regency was considered a successful one, as he governed the empire with efficiency while expanding its borders southward, at Jin's expense. Murong Ping's role in this success is unclear. In 361, the magician Ding Jin (‰∏ÅÈÄ≤), whom Murong Wei trusted, tried to flatter Murong Ke by suggesting to him to kill Murong Ping, but Murong Ke became angry and executed Ding. In 366, both Murong Ke and Murong Ping offered to resign their posts and return all of their authorities to Murong Wei. Murong Wei declined. In 367, Murong Ke grew ill. He tried to persuade Murong Ping, Murong Wei, and Murong Wei's older brother Murong Zang (ÊÖïÂÆπËáß) the Prince of Le'an that one of his main responsibilities, as the commander of the armies, should be transferred to Murong Chui the Prince of Wu, his brother, as he saw Murong Chui as a capable general, but after Murong Ke died later that year, Murong Ping declined to do so, and instead gave that post to Murong Wei's younger brother Murong Chong the Prince of Zhongshan. Murong Ping himself assumed the regency and held power in conjunction with Empress Dowager Kezuhun. Regency Murong Ping, while apparently having military abilities, was incompetent and corrupt as a regent. In 368, when four of Former Qin's dukes rebelled against the Former Qin emperor Fu JiƒÅn, they sought help from Former Yan. Many officials, including Murong Jun's brother Murong De the Prince of Fanyang, saw this as a perfect opportunity to conquer Former Qin, but Murong Ping declined to take any actions against Former Qin, so Former Qin forces crushed the four rebel dukes. In 368 as well, the key official Yue Wan (ÊÇÖÁ∂∞), concerned about the growing corrupt practice by noble families of putting commoners into their fiefs‚Äîa practice that would mean that those commoners were only responsible to them, not responsible for paying taxes to the empire, leading to the empire's treasury being so lacking that it was unable to pay its officials‚Äîpetitioned Murong Wei for a reform ending the practice. Murong Wei approved the reform and put Yue in charge of it, and Yue restored over 200,000 people to the tax- paying ranks. The nobles were all resentful of Yue, who died later in 368‚Äîand while most historians believed that he died of natural causes, having been already ill previously ‚Äî the Book of Jin stated that he was poisoned by Murong Ping, who had much to lose from Yue's reform. In 369, the Jin general Huan Wen launched a major attack against Former Yan, defeating every army that Murong Ping sent against him, including the most major one commanded by Murong Zang, advancing to the vicinity of Yecheng, by now Former Yan's capital. In panic, Murong Ping and Murong Wei considered fleeing to the old capital Helong (ÂíåÈæç, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). Murong Chui, whose authority had been curtailed by Murong Ping previously, offered to make one last try to resist. Meanwhile, Murong Ping also sent messengers to Former Qin, requesting assistance‚Äîoffering to cede to Former Qin the Luoyang region, which Murong Ke had captured in 365 if Former Qin would assist. Murong Chui, along with Murong De, were able to deal Huan a major defeat, and Former Qin forces soon arrived and dealt Huan another defeat. Huan would not be able to launch a major attack against Former Yan again. However, Murong Ping and Empress Dowager Kezuhun soon engaged in two damaging decisions. Still resentful of Murong Chui (whose wife was her sister but whom he did not favor), Empress Dowager Kezuhun denied him and his soldiers rewards and in fact considered killing him, a decision that Murong Ping concurred in because he was also apprehensive of Murong Chui. Murong Chui, hearing the news, fled to Former Qin and became a general for Fu JiƒÅn. They also refused to cede the Luoyang region to Former Qin, as previously promised. In anger, late in 369, Fu Jian sent a 60,000-men force, commanded by his prime minister Wang Meng, against Former Yan. In spring 370, Wang first advanced on Luoyang and forced its surrender. He then advanced on Hu Pass (Â£∫Èóú, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), defeating all Former Yan resistance on the way. He then captured Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Murong Ping led a 300,000-men strong force against Wang, but apprehensive of Wang, he stopped at Lu River (ÊΩûÂ∑ù, in modern Changzhi as well). Wang soon arrived to prepare to face off against him. Meanwhile, Murong Ping made the worst display of his corruption at this time‚Äîkeeping guards at forests and streams, disallowing commoners and even his own soldiers from cutting firewood or fishing unless they paid a usage fee in either money or silk. He soon had a stash of wealth, but completely lost the morale of his soldiers. Murong Wei, hearing this, sent a messenger to rebuke him and ordering him to distribute the wealth to the soldiers, but the damage was done. In winter 370, the armies engaged, and despite the numerical advantage that Murong Ping had, Wang crushed him, and Murong Ping fled back to Yecheng by himself. Murong Wei abandoned Yecheng and tried to flee to Helong, but was captured on the way, ending Former Yan. Murong Ping fled to Goguryeo, which, however, arrested him and delivered him back to Former Qin. Fu JiƒÅn pardoned him and made him an imperial assistant. In 372, Murong Chui told Fu JiƒÅn that Murong Ping was the cause of Former Yan's destruction and should be killed; instead Fu JiƒÅn effectively exiled Murong Ping by making him a governor of a remote commandery. This was the last historical record of him, and it is not known when or how he died. When Murong Chui restored the regime as Later Yan, Murong Yi (ÊÖïÂÆπÊáø), grandson of Murong Ping, succeeded his title as Duke of Shangyong.

He was a pioneer in archaeology known for his study of art from the Viking era in Norway. He is most frequently associated with his work on the Oseberg ship (Osebergfunnet) near T√∏nsberg, Norway. Biography Haakon Shetelig grew up in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway). He was the son of Harald Fredrik Schetelig (1846‚Äì1918) and Magnhild Pedersen (1850‚Äì1920), and the nephew of Tord Pedersen. He and studied classical languages and Old Norse philology and history at the University of Christiania (now the University of Oslo). In 1901, Shetelig was hired as curator and manager of the historical- antiquarian part of the Bergen Museum, the University of Bergen museum in Bergen, Norway. He was appointed professor in 1914 and worked as director of the History and Antiquarian Department until 1942.Fra Bergens Museum til et moderne universitet (Bergen Museum) Shetelig and his colleague, Swedish archaeologist Gabriel Gustafson, led the team that dug out and preserved the Oseberg ship in 1904‚Äì1905. After Gustafson's death in 1915, he collaborated with archaeologist Anton Wilhelm Br√∏gger and Hjalmar Falk to publish the discovery. In 1920 he led the excavation of the Kvalsund ships (Kvalsundskipet), which were found at the Kvalsund farm at Her√∏y, M√∏re og Romsdal County in 1920. In 1910 he founded the magazine Kunst og Kultur with Harry Fett, which he edited (1910‚Äì1927). He published a number of papers and writings about archaeology, history, and cultural history. He also wrote the first volume of the six-volume series Viking Antiquities in Great Britain and Ireland, for which he also served as the main editor. He introduced the Shetelig axiom, which refers to the idea that the Viking age began when Scandinavian Vikings attacked Lindisfarne in 793. Haakon Shetelig was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the Royal Norwegian Scientific Society. He was appointed Commander of the Order of St. Olav in 1946 and held several foreign orders and medals.

Guzek, 546 U.S. 517 (2006), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not grant criminal defendants facing the death penalty the right to introduce new evidence of their innocence during sentencing that was not introduced during trial. Accordingly, states could constitutionally exclude such evidence from the sentencing phase of a capital trial. Background of the case =First state appeal= Randy Lee Guzek was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.Deschutes County Circuit Court, Judge Thomas M. Mosgrove presiding. Chief Deputy DA Ron Brown prosecuted the case. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed his conviction but vacated the sentence.State v. Guzek, 797 P.2d 1031 (Ore. 1990). The court ruled that the death sentence violated the Eighth AmendmentAs applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; see Incorporation. because the jury was not presented with a \\"general mitigation question,\\" which would ensure that it had the opportunity to give effect to any relevant mitigating evidence outside of the statutory factors that were submitted to it. The court remanded the case back to the trial court for a new sentencing trial. =Second state appeal= On remand, Guzek was sentenced to death again.Judge Mosgrove again presided over the sentencing. Chief Deputy DA Joshua Marquis prosecuted the re-trial. Guzek appealed, and the Oregon Supreme Court again vacated the sentence, ruling that \\"victim impact\\" evidence that the State had presented during sentencing was not relevant, and so unconstitutionally secured the death sentence.State v. Guzek, 906 P.2d 272 (Ore. 1995). The case was remanded for a third sentencing trial. =Third state appeal= During the third sentencing trial, prosecuted by special prosecutor Joshua Marquis, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury about a \\"true-life\\" sentencing option--life in prison without the possibility of parole--as an alternative to the death penalty.Judge Pierre Van Rysselberghe presided over the third sentencing. Guzek was once again sentenced to death. Based on this error, the Oregon Supreme Court once again vacated Guzek's sentence and remanded for a new sentencing trial.State v. Guzek, 86 P.3d 1106 (Ore. 2004). Seeking to avoid further errors at his fourth sentencing proceeding, the court also addressed the exclusion of alibi evidence that Guzek had sought to admit, which consisted of transcripts of testimony by his mother and grandfather stating he was with them at the time of the murder. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled that under state law and the Eighth Amendment, Guzek had a right to present this evidence during his death penalty sentencing, and directed the trial court to admit all alibi evidence he submitted. The State of Oregon then petitioned the Supreme Court for review. =Fourth sentencing trial= As the result of the opinion of SCOTUS the Oregon Supreme Court reviewed the case yet again in 2007 (State of Oregon vs. Randy Lee Guzek, 153 P.3d 101 (Ore. 2007) and determined that in accordance of the SCOTUS decision that live alibi testimony would not be allowed but that prior transcript alibi testimony of the defendant's mother and grandfather would be admitted. Although the sole remaining issue for the defendant was his right to have life without parole considered if he waived any ex post facto right, on May 5, 2010 as jury selection was starting Guzek wrote a pro-se 5-page brief demanding that life without parole (LWOP) be removed from consideration and the presiding judge, Judge Jack Billings so ordered.http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2010/05/randy_lee_guzek_revels_in_the.html ordered Clatsop County DA Josh Marquis returned for a third time to re- prosecute Guzek. In May 2010, after several further delays the case of State of Oregon vs. Randy Guzek went to trial again in Deschutes County, Oregon. On June 17, 2010, after about 5 hours of deliberation, the 8-woman, 4-man jury unanimously answered all the four questions required for a sentence of death to be rendered under Oregon's capital sentencing scheme \\"yes,\\" and Guzek was immediately sentenced to death again for the murders of Rod Houser and Lois Houser.http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2010/06/the_dead_man_resumes_walking.html The court's decision The United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Oregon Supreme Court, ruling that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment did not create a right to introduce evidence of innocence in a defendant's death penalty sentencing phase if it had not been introduced in the trial phase. States instead were permitted by the U.S. Constitution to limit such evidence to that which was already presented at trial. Guzek had also argued that this alibi evidence could be used to impeach the testimony of other witnesses, and the Court left it open to the Oregon Supreme Court on remand to determine whether this was permissible under Oregon law.

The service was created in 1998 following the University's expansion onto several new campuses, requiring new transport links between them. The current contractor of the service is Bluestar, part of the Go-Ahead Group, who took over in 2008. The service also encourages use by members of the public outside the university community. History =Foundations= The foundations for the service began with the opening of the Southampton Oceanography Centre in 1996. Located in Southampton Docks, this was the first of the University's campuses that were not either within walking distance of the main campus or were self-contained (whose students had no need to travel to a different campus ‚Äì Winchester School of Art and Southampton General Hospital being the main examples). As a result, the University launched the student only shuttle service to serve the new campus. The service ran every half-hour with one service every hour running via Avenue Campus while the other ran via Portswood. The service was run by the University's Business Services division. =First Southampton= Dennis Dart 9SDL, converted to run on LNG, in First Hampshire \\"Uni-link\\" livery, The Uni-link wordmark, used by First and Minerva Accord. First used the logo over a light blue, pink and navy blue background while Minerva used it, as seen here, on a dark blue background. In 1998, the University made a three-year agreement with local operator First Southampton to run a new bus service under the Uni-link name. First's service launched on 21 September 1998 and saw the introduction of three new routes, 101, 102 and 103, operated under the Uni- link branding. First also rerouted their 4, 6, 11, 13 and 20 routes so that they would run closer to the University allowing better connections with other areas of Southampton. The company also ran two night services, labelled the 104 and the 105. =Minerva Accord= A Scania OmniCity in Accord Livery. In 2001, as the University's agreement with First finished, the University made some changes to the service following some dissatisfaction and some bad experiences with the service. The University made Uni-link a company itself and awarded the operation of this service under contract. The first contract winner was Minerva Accord, who started their 5-year contract at the beginning of the 2001/2002 academic year. At launch, the company ran two main routes, the U1 and the U2, with a number of smaller routes and variations also in existence. Later in the life of the company, Uni-link launched the U6 and the U9 routes. As some of these routes, especially the U1, was used very heavily the company received various grants that allowed their fleets to expand. The company added its last route in September 2005 when it was awarded a five-year contract by Southampton City Council to run the City-link service shuttle service in Southampton city centre. This nearly doubled their passenger numbers, adding one million passengers per annum. Uni-link also began trials of articulated buses and Wi-Fi on some of their fleet during 2007. =Bluestar= The Bluestar Uni-link logo used between 2008 and 2013. In 2008, local bus company Bluestar were named as the winners of the next ten-year contract to run the service. The service launched on 29 September 2008, coinciding with the new university year. The new company used a fleet composed mainly of new vehicles. In 2012, free Wi-Fi was installed on all Uni-link and Bluestar buses as a result of a ¬£4.5 million investment from Transport for South Hampshire. In July 2013, Uni-link changed their smartcard system to 'The Key' smartcard that adheres to ITSO specifications and is currently used by several other companies owned by the Go-Ahead Group. The smartcard allowed Uni-link pass holders access onto Bluestar's central Southampton services (and vice versa) and allowed for greater deals with other Go South Coast operators. However it meant that the older cards, which included the University of Southampton student ID card, would not work with the new system leading to some controversy among the student population. In December 2017, during a joint announcement by Bluestar and the University of Southampton it was revealed that the contract between the University of Southampton and Bluestar for the latter to operate the service would be extended to run to 2028. http://www.bluestarbus.co.uk/article.shtml?articleid=7914 Fleet Uni- link's current fleet is made up of thirty-two Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double decker buses. These went into service in September 2018 and feature a refreshed turquoise green livery with different colour stripes down the side. They replace the double decker and single decker fleet used previously and are used on all routes. The old fleet has since been reallocated to Bluestar to help with passenger increase schemes and to replace older Bluestar fleet including Mercedes-Benz Citaro. The old fleet is in the process of re-branding to the Bluestar livery and used on route 17.

The Type 3 Ka-Chi was based on an extensively modified Imperial Japanese Army Type 1 Chi-He medium tank (it had 2 more road-wheels and two more return rollers on each side) and was a larger and more capable version of the earlier Type 2 Ka-Mi amphibious tank. History and development The success of the Type 2 Ka-Mi design pleased the planners in the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, and it was determined that a larger version with stronger armor and armament would be useful in future amphibious warfare operations. The Type 3 Ka-Chi prototype was completed in late 1943 and the first units entered service that same year. However, only 19 Type 3 Ka-Chi's were built from 1943 to 1945.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: Type 3 Amphibious Tank \\"Ka-Chi\\" The main priorities of the Japanese Navy were in warship and aircraft production, and lacking in any definite plans for additional amphibious operations, production of the Type 3 Ka-Chi remained a very low priority. Design The Type 3 Ka-Chi was based a heavily modified version of the chassis of the army's Type 1 Chi-He medium tank, and thus featured considerably better armored protection and firepower than the earlier Type 2 Ka-Mi. It had smooth sides that faired into front and rear flotation pontoons made of sheet-metal. The front pontoon had a curved 'bow' shape and both pontoons could be jettisoned from inside the tank once the tank had landed. However, in practice, the pontoons were usually retained, as they provided some marginal additional protection against enemy fire. The undercarriage used the Hara system, with the addition of 2 more road-wheels and two more return rollers on each side than the Type 1 Chi-He. The hull was welded and water- proofed \\"with rubber seals and gaskets\\". The water propulsion was provided by twin-screws and it had two steering screws. The Type 3 Ka-Chi had a distinctive large snorkel behind the turret for aerating the diesel engine more efficiently and keeping the exhaust free of water.Japanese Armored Vehicles of the Second World War The main gun of Type 3 Ka-Chi was the Type 1 47 mm tank gun with barrel length of 2.250 meters (L/48), EL angle of fire by ‚àí15 to +20 degrees, AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees, muzzle velocity by 810 m/s and penetration of 55 mm/100 m, 30 mm/1,000 m.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: \\"Tank Guns\\" This was the same 47 mm gun used on the army's Type 97-Shinhoto Chi-Ha. Secondary armament was a coaxial Type 97 heavy tank machine gun and a hull mounted weapon of the same type. The gun turret was designed with an extended circular cupola to keep the hatch above water. The vehicle required a crew of seven, one of whom (as with the Type 2 Ka-Mi) served as an on-board mechanic. Service record The Type 3 Ka-Chi was produced in very limited numbers, but proved useful due to its capability to be launched from a submarine, which enabled it to accommodate the increasingly difficult task of daytime reinforcement for isolated island garrisons located in the South Pacific and in Southeast Asia. The Type 3 Ka-Chi was deployed only in the Japan homeland and did not see combat. See also *DD tank - World War II British tank flotation system. *T-38 - World War II, Soviet amphibious light tank.

The \\"Selby is God\\" fans received some notoriety after Selby's grand slam off Rivera in 2002, appearing in The Plain Dealer and on television. Nicknaming Travis Hafner Selby is also known for bestowing Cleveland Indians DH Travis Hafner with his nickname, \\"Pronk\\". Selby explained the nickname to the Buffalo News: > Texas came to town in 2002 and I was with [former Indian] Lee Stevens on the > bench saying, 'This dude is unbelievable. He's a real project.' He was > hitting the ball everywhere. We got him the next spring and we called him > 'Project' all the time. One day I passed him, and said, 'What's up, you big > donkey?' He said, 'Hey, I can't be the Project and the Donkey.' > So we started going with 'Pronkey'. In Spanish, we made it 'El Pronko.' Then > it got down to 'The Pronk' and finally just 'Pronk.' It fits him. He doesn't > look like Shrek or anything else. He just looks like a Pronk.

Named after Issai Schur, Schur-convex functions are used in the study of majorization. Every function that is convex and symmetric is also Schur-convex.

La Verna, in Latin Alverna and geographically known as Monte Penna, is a locality on Mount Penna, an isolated mountain of situated in the centre of the Tuscan Apennines, rising above the valley of the Casentino, central Italy. The place is known especially for its association with Saint Francis of Assisi (he is said to have received the stigmata here) and for the Sanctuary of La Verna (Santuario della Verna), which grew up in his honour. Administratively it falls within the Tuscan province of Arezzo and the comune of Chiusi della Verna, Italy. The Sanctuary of La Verna, located a few kilometers from Chiusi della Verna (Arezzo), in the National Park of Casentino Forests, Mount Falterona and Campigna, is famous for being the place where St. Francis of Assisi would receive the stigmata on September 14, 1224. Built in the southern part of Mount Penna at high, the Sanctuary is home to numerous chapels and places of prayer and meditation In August 1921 Pope Benedict XV elevated the church to the status of minor basilica. Name origin A sanctuary was built atop a place of worship site of the ancient goddess Laverna. Father Salvatore Vitale, a Franciscan scholar of the seventeenth century, wrote: Lo stregone di Assisi: Laverna, l'oscura d√®a senza corpo :\\"About the reason why this Sacred Mount was called Laverna. :This sacred Mount, for ancient tradition of memory it is known, and for many authors, that it was named Laverna after a temple of Laverna, pagan goddess of thieves, built there, and attended by many crassatori and thieves who were in the thick forest that covers it; and thick, deep and horrible caves and ravines, where they dwelt safe to loot and plunder them wayfarers...\\" The ancient pagan worship of the goddess Laverna, was the protector of refugees. The municipality of Chiusi della Verna in the valley is also named for the goddess. The crevices and other hiding places in this territory, suggest such a purpose. The same meaning associated with the worship of the god of the mountain Pen, from which the Apennines and Mount Pen are named. History La Verna is the most famous monasteries of the Casentino, and one of the most important Franciscan. St. Francis in the spring of 1213 met the Count Orlando of Chiusi della Verna, who, impressed by his preaching, made a gift of La Verna to him and his followers. It became a place of numerous and prolonged periods of withdrawal. Some small cells were built and the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli (1216‚Äì18). The decisive impulse to the development of a large monastery was given by the episode of the stigmata (1224). The last visit of Francis to the mountain was in the summer of 1224. He retired in August, for a 40-day fast in preparation for the feast of St. Michael, and while he was absorbed in prayer, he received the stigmata. Pope Alexander IV took the site under papal protection and in 1260 a church was built and consecrated. St. Bonaventure and many bishops were in attendance. A few years later the Chapel of the Stigmata was built by Count Simon of Battifolle, close to the place of the miracle. An older chapel, Santa Maria degli Angeli, had been built in 1218 by St. Francis. The main church was begun in 1348 but remained unfinished until 1459. From the main church, the friars make a solemn procession twice a day to the Chapel of the Stigmata. The monastery was partially destroyed by fire in the fifteenth century and later restored. The restorations took three centuries. In 1810 and in 1866 the friars were expelled temporarily following the suppression of religious orders. La Verna and Saint Francis of Assisi Count Orlando of Chiusi gave La Verna to Francis on May 8, 1213 as a retreat specially favourable for contemplation, and in 1218 built him the chapel Santa Maria degli Angeli. \\"I have in Tuscany a diverse little mountain, which is called the mountain of Alvernia, which is the very lonely and savage act and it's good for those who want to do penance in a place removed from the people, or those who want to lonely life. If you like, I will gladly give it to you and your comrades for my soul.‚Äù (Count Orlando of Chiusi della Verna before donating the mountain to St. Francis of Assisi, 1213.):it:Santuario della Verna; October 28, 2015 In August, 1224, frustrated by the changes in the Order of Friars Minor, Francis withdrew to La Verna to keep a forty days fast in preparation for Michaelmas. As he arrived he was allegedly received by a multitude of singing birds which surrounded St Francis, some perching upon his shoulders, some on his arms, and others at his feet.Little Flowers of St. Francis, chapter 53. While praying on the mountain-side he received (on or about 14 September) the stigmata. After seeing a vision of a seraphim he began to develop nails of hardened flesh which protruded from his hands and feet. He also began to form a wound in his side like that of Christ. Thus La Verna came to be seen as sacred ground. Pope Alexander IV took it under his protection. In 1260 a church was consecrated there in presence of St. Bonaventure and several bishops. A few years later the Chapel of the Stigmata was erected, paid for by Count Simone of Battifole, near the spot where the miracle took place. The Chiesa Maggiore was begun in 1348, although not finished until 1459. Assumption of the Virgin, lead-glazed terracotta, by Andrea Della Robbia, in the sanctuary. =The convent= From the Chiesa Maggiore the friars dwelling on La Verna go in solemn procession twice daily to the Chapel of the Stigmata. On the Feast of the Stigmata (September 17) and on other festivals, large crowds of priests with their people from neighbouring parishes, as well as strangers, visit the mountains, and on such occasions the friars often accommodate and entertain between 2,000 and 3,000 pilgrims. The friary was partly destroyed by fire in the 15th century; it suffered desecration also during the war of this century. In 1810, and again in 1866, the friars were expelled in consequence of the suppression of religious orders; but at present they are in full possession of La Verna. Buildings =Chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli= The building was the Chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli (Mary in Heaven), built in 1216 by St. Francis himself. He took the name from his home in Assisi. It was also in 1216, that Francis experienced the apparition Mary. Count Orlando helped finance the original plan. It was after only 1250, that the church was enlarged at the direction of Cardinal Rainaldo and Pope Innocent IV. It was consecrated in 1260. To the right of the Major Basilica, under a low porch is the chapel. It has a single nave, divided into two parts. Renovated and expanded after 1250. Of the original structure only the bell of 1257, on the belfry remains unchanged. Inside are two paintings of the Florentine painter Ferdinand Folchi of 1877. They depict a meeting between St. Francis and the Count Orlando Catani at the fortress of San Leo in Montefeltro, when he give the sacred Mount of Verna to the friars, 8 May 1213, the other depicts the dedication of the church Santa Maria degli Angeli. The partition between the two parts have two reliefs of glazed earthenware, one depicts the Nativity with St. Francis and St. Anthony, the other the Piet√† between the Virgin and St. John, both by Andrea with his son Luke Bartholomew II said \\"the Young\\" Della Robbia; They are dated between 1490 and 1493. Above the altar is the reredos, of glazed earthenware. It depicts the Assumption where Mary gives her sacred girdle to St. Thomas, with St. Gregory, Francis and Bonaventura. =Quadrant= The quadrant is the paved square with a view over valley. It takes its name from the sundial, which is engraved on the wall of the bell tower. In the square there is a large wooden cross planted in the rock. On the left is the well for the guesthouse: it is a cistern of the sixteenth century that was used for pilgrims and guests. In front of the square, there is the portico of the Major Basilica; under the porch right, finished in 1536 but completely rebuilt after World War II, there is a crucifix that spans San Francisco, bronze copy is from a painting of Spanish Murillo and work of Vincent Rosignoli, donated to La Verna in 1888 by Pope Leo XIII. The same artist painted, in 1903, the bronze statue of St. Francis with a child, placed at the entrance gate of the entire religious complex. =Basilica Major= The construction of the Basilica was begun in 1348. It was a gift of Count Tarlato Pietramala. It was not completed until 1509, thanks to the contribution of the Wool Guild of Florence. Overlooking the quadrant, the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and consecrated in 1568. The portico is of Renaissance design and extends around the right side almost to the bell tower. The church is built as a Latin cross with a single nave and vaulted ceilings. Inside, there are several glazed earthenware images. To the right near the front door, Our Lady of Refuge (i.e.; Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saints Onofrio, Anthony Abbot, Francis and Mary Magdalene), given to the Monastery by the shopkeepers and the results of Andrea della Robbia, 1500- 1510. Further in on the right, is the chapel of the relics, (1635), with the saint's robe, a remnant of his blood, other relics. Beyond the second entrance to the church is an entrance to the Chapel of the Nativity, which is access to the Chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli. As you approach the entrance to the presbytery and the sacristy is another side chapel, commissioned by Prince Piero Ginori Conti (chapel Ginori) in the late nineteenth century It was consecrated by the bishop Emanuele Mignone in 1939, and sporting the second pipe organ. Behind the chancel is the choir, with two rows of walnut stalls in the central part, with inlays depicting Santa Maria Assunta, San Lorenzo and Blessed John, the work of the twentieth century between Leonardo Galiberti from Woodshed. Additional inlays from 1509 by Piero Zanobi. On both sides of the presbytery there are two figures of St. Francis and St. Anthony Abbot (about 1475-80). The chapel to the left of the presbytery has the organ. The chapel is dedicated to the 'Ascension of Jesus, with the impressive work of the same name in glazed terracotta by Andrea della Robbia and his son Luke Bartholomew II in 1480. Looking back on the left side of the church, the chapel front mate with the colonnade is dedicated to the 'Annunciation, and retains the same name by Andrea della Robbia, dated 1475. Going further back to the entrance, the chapel of St. Michael, which holds the remains of Blessed John of La Verna (or from Fermo), brother of the thirteenth century which Christ appeared at the site of the chapel of the beech, a small stone building in woods over the Sanctuary. Corridor of the Stigmata Leading of to the right of the Basilica Maggiore, is access to corridor of the Stigmata. First is a small chapel, dedicated to Count Checco Montedoglio and containing a Pieta with Saints John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, Francis, Archangel Michael, Anthony of Padua and Jerome (circa 1525-1532) sculpted by Santi Buglioni. The Corridor of the Stigmata was covered between 1578 and 1582. Since 1431, the daily procession of the ninth hour (1500 hr or 3:00 p.m.) occurs. The passageway is lined with frescoes representing the episodes of the life of St. Francis. Eighteen panels were made by Baccio Maria Bacci in two stages between 1929 and 1962 to replace the seventeenth-century frescoes by Fra Emmanuel from Como, already renewed in 1840 by Luigi and Giovanni Ademollo, whose work is still visible in the last three boxes. About halfway up the corridor is a doorway, out to the \\"bed\\" of St. Francis. It is a small cave, where the saint rested on the bare ground. To protect the ground from those who would remove it, a grid was placed there. =Chapel of the Stigmata= At the end of the Corridor of the Stigmata, are several small rooms. On the right is the Chapel Loddi, with the access to the hermitage. Ahead is the Chapel of the Cross. To the left with the Oratory of St. Anthony, the chapel of St. Bonaventure and St. Sebastian, while on the left the chapel of the Madonna della Scala. At the end is the chapel of the Stigmata, the heart of the sanctuary. It was built around 1263, a nave, covered by a cross vault. On the floor, is marked by a plaque would be the place where the miracle of the stigmata. Above the door is a round of the workshop of Andrea della Robbia and workshop with students of the Madonna and Child blessing, of 1480-1485. On the back wall, is placed a monumental arched blade, always glazed earthenware, depicting the Crucifixion, among angels, with the foot of the Madonna, St. John St. Francis and St. Jerome mourners, followed in 1481 by Andrea della Robbia. This marks the spot where Francis of Assisi is said to have received the first stigmata in Christian history, in 1224. Forest Monumental de La Verna The Forest Monumental de La Verna has been preserved by the Franciscan Friars. They have sought to maintain harmony between man and nature. The forest is a Spruce- Beech forest. Some specimens of up to in height and diameters up to . In the northwest area is the beech forest. The Forest has an extraordinary wealth of plant and the presence of a large wildlife. There are deer, fallow deer, roe deer and wild boar, with their natural predator, the wolf. Bird species are varied with the inclusion of eagle, owl and peregrine falcon.

The enunciating voice, in at least some aircraft systems, may be either male or female and in some cases this may be selected according to pilot preference. If the voice is female, it may be referred to as Bitching Betty; if the voice is male, it may be referred to as Barking Bob. A female voice is heard on military aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Mikoyan MiG-29. A male voice is heard on Boeing commercial airliners and is also used in the BAE Hawk. In the United Kingdom the term Nagging Nora is sometimes used, and in New Zealand the term used for Boeing aircraft is Hank the Yank. The voice warning system used on London Underground trains, which also uses a female voice, is known to some staff as Sonya, as it \\"gets on ya nerves\\". Notable examples There are two notable systems, which employ voice warnings, and which are found in most commercial and military aircraft: TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) and TAWS/EGPWS (terrain avoidance warning system / enhanced ground proximity warning system). Both systems provide warnings and verbal instructions. The auditory warnings produced by these systems usually include a separate attention-getting sound, followed by one or more verbal commands to the pilot/crew. Perhaps the most widely known example, encountered in many video games and movies, is the \\"Pull up! Pull up!\\" command. Other common spoken warnings are \\"Caution, terrain\\", \\"Windshear! Windshear!\\", or \\"Traffic! Traffic!\\". These may be followed by short directions to the pilot, advising how the situation may be resolved. TCAS and TAWS/EGPWS are usually integrated to prevent conflicting advice, such as an instruction to \\"Descend! Descend!\\" to avoid another aircraft when the aircraft is already close to the ground. Modern Boeing and Airbus airliners both feature a male voice, which calls out height above terrain on approach to landing, and other related warnings. Airbus aircraft feature a distinctive British RP accent (heard on recent builds of the A320 and all Airbus aircraft since the A330 and A340), or a French accent (heard on ECAM-equipped A300s, A310s and early A320s). A female voice was incorporated into McDonnell Douglas DC-9, MD-80/90, McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and Boeing 717 (inherited from McDonnell Douglas after the merger with Boeing) series aircraft in their Central Aural Warning Systems (CAWS). These systems provided a voice for most warnings, including fire, altitude, cabin altitude, stall, overspeed, autopilot disconnect and so on. In more advanced cockpits, on newer aircraft, there may be many other voice warnings managed by an integrated indications and crew alerting system (ICAS) such as \\"Gear up. Gear up.\\" These may be warning words or phrases, or simply declarative statements which augment the pilot's situation awareness. Voice gender Early human factors research in aircraft and other domains indicated that female voices were more authoritative to male pilots and crew members and were more likely to get their attention. Much of this research was based on pilot experiences, particularly in combat situations, where the pilots were being guided by female air traffic controllers. They reported being able to most easily pick out the female voice from amid the flurry of radio chatter. In October 1996 a report by UK's Defence Research Agency on the fast jet Collision Warning System Technical Demonstrator Programme (Reference DRAMS/A VS/CR96294/1) reported: \\"The primary alerting signal from the CWS to the crew was an audible warning passed over the aircraft intercom system. For the first flight these warnings were given in a male voice but, on the advice of the crew, this was changed to a female voice for second flight onwards. They said that a female voice offered greater clarity.\\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/194059/response/494144/attach/3/DRA%20AS%20VS%20CR96294%201%20a%20COMPRESSED.pdf More recent research, however, carried out since more females have been employed as pilots and air traffic controllers, indicates that the original popular hypothesis may be unreliable. Edworthy and colleagues in 2003, based at Plymouth University in UK, for example, found that both acoustic and non- acoustic differences between male and female speakers were negligible. Therefore, they recommended, the choice of speaker should depend on the overlap of noise and speech spectra. Female voices did, however, appear to have an advantage in that they could portray a greater range of urgencies because of their usually higher pitch and pitch range. They reported an experiment showing that knowledge about the sex of a speaker has no effect on judgments of perceived urgency, with acoustic variables accounting for such differences. Arrabito in 2009, however, at Defence Research and Development Canada in Toronto, found that with simulated cockpit background radio traffic, a male voice rather than a female voice, in a monotone or urgent announcing style, resulted in the largest proportion of correct and fastest identification response times to verbal warnings, regardless of the gender of the listener. Voices There have been several \\"Bitching Bettys\\", over the years, for various commercial and military aircraft: * Kim Crow - Crow's was the first voice to be digitized. Pilots and astronauts know her as the original Bitching Betty. * Joan Elms - known as ‚ÄúSexy Sally‚Äù to the flight crews of the Convair B-58 Hustler on the plane‚Äôs magnetic tape-based warning system. * Erica Lane - her voice can be heard in the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter. * Sue Milne - her voice is used in the Eurofighter Typhoon. * Leslie Shook - her voice is used in the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Shook retired in 2016.. Boeing, 2016-03-07, Retrieved 2020-02-19. * Patricia Hoyt - her voice was used in the Boeing 717 and the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. She was working in the Boeing 717 program as a mechanical engineer at the time. Other applications Voice warning systems included in cars of the late 1970s to early 1980s, such as the Datsun and Nissan Z-Car series, found in the 280ZX and 1984‚Äì1988 300ZX (optional in the base model and standard in the Turbo model), and the Datsun Maxima and Nissan Maxima of the early 1980s, were also known as Bitching Betty. The Datsun system issued commands such as \\"lights are on\\", or \\"left door is open\\". The system used a small box located under the vehicle's dashboard that implemented a small, white plastic record disc that used a magnetic cartridge to play spoken commands through the vehicle's audio system's speakers, similar to that of some Texas Instruments talking toys of the time period. Datsun's original name for the feature was \\"Talking Lady\\". Some Acuras (Honda's luxury car marque in the United States, Canada, and China) of the mid 2000s, would ask the driver to \\"please fasten your seatbelt\\" when the driver's seatbelt was not fastened, in addition to a chime warning.

UK Parliament Early life Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Laming studied Applied Social Studies at Durham University in 1960. Social work Laming worked as a probation officer and psychiatric social worker in Nottingham, before moving to Hertfordshire County Council in 1971, becoming director of social services in 1975. In 1990, his department was strongly criticised for its handling of a case that centred on allegations made to Hertfordshire social services by the father of a young girl who was concerned that his daughter was being sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. The child was interviewed in front of her mother, a violation of official guidelines. Police and social services performed an overnight raid on his house and took his daughter to her mother and her mother's boyfriend. Laming denied him access to an internal inquiry report. In 1995, the Local Government Ombudsman made a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' against the department.Verkaik, Robert, \\"Head of Anna Climbie inquiry ran department that failed to protect\\", The Independent (via findarticles.com), 20 January 2001.

In the same year, he also investigated management in the prison service. In 2001, he chaired the public inquiry into eight-year-old Victoria Climbi√©'s death. Laming's appointment was controversial because of his previous post as head of Hertfordshire county council's social services department. The father of the daughter in the Hertfordshire case said, \\"I don't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990\\". Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said, \\"the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming's appointment to head this inquiry\\"; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said, \\"I think the government maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe, even yet, they will think again\\".

His final report was published on 28 February 2003,\\"Victoria Climbi√© Report Calls for Radical Change in the Management of Public Services for Children and Families\\" , 28 January 2003 and led to many child protection reforms. The report led to the formation of the Every Child Matters programme, a framework to improve the lives of children; the introduction of the Children Act 2004, an Act of Parliament that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms; the creation of ContactPoint, a database that will hold information on all children in England and Wales; and the creation of the post of children's commissioner, to co-ordinate efforts to improve child protection. Lord Laming was appointed in November 2008 to investigate Britain's social services on a national basis following the death of Baby P. The subject caused heated arguments in the House of Commons between Gordon Brown and David Cameron forcing the Commons Speaker to intervene on a number of occasions to restore order. In June 2011, Lord Laming was elected Convenor of the Crossbench Peers in the House of Lords, which office he left in September 2015, when he became the Chairman of Committees.

The valley is a picturesque area of gently rolling countryside. It lies in the lee of the Black Mountains, Wales. The main villages are Dorstone, Peterchurch, Abbey Dore and Ewyas Harold. Origin of the name The name Golden Valley probably derives from a confusion of the name of the River Dore with the French d'or, meaning 'of gold'. The Normans might have confused the Welsh word d≈µr, meaning 'water', with 'd'or'. A similar situation occurred with the Douro river in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) where the Romance languages adopted the original Celtic name and changed the meaning to the similar-sounding precious metal. Local points of interest Arthur's Stone, Herefordshire Dore Abbey Arthur's Stone, Herefordshire, located just outside the village of Dorstone, is a chamber tomb from the Neolithic Period, and dates from some time between 3700 and 2700 BC. Arthur's Stone is Herefordshire's oldest man-made structure. Dore Abbey is a former mediaeval Cistercian monastery that during the summer offers a programme of musical concerts. It was built between 1175 and 1220 and restored in the 1630s. Nearby is Bacton Church with the monument to Blanche Parry - she was close to Queen Elizabeth I for 56 years. This monument, securely dated before November 1578, is the earliest depiction anywhere of Queen Elizabeth I as an icon, as 'Gloriana'. It pre-dates the paintings showing this theme. Bacton Church also has rare 1914-1918, World War I, medal ribbons depicted in stone on several memorial wall plaques. The diaries of Francis Kilvert extol the beauty of the local landscape of English river valleys sheltered by the Black Mountains between Hay on Wye and Hereford and it is Bredwardine where he is buried. Kilvert was Rector at St Andrew's church, Bredwardine until his early death in 1879. Snodhill castle is a very early Norman stone fortification. Ewyas Harold Castle is an early Norman motte and bailey castle and St Michael's church, Ewyas Harold contains a 13th-century or 14th-century effigy of a lady holding a heart in the palm of her hand. The last remaining toll bridge in Herefordshire at Whitney-on-Wye leads to Hay-on-Wye. A plaque written in Welsh and dated 1574 was discovered during renovations in St Margaret's Church, near Newton, and is currently on display within the church. The church also contains a printed notice of the duties of churchwardens in both English and Welsh. Notice of duties of Churchwardens in English and Welsh, in St Margaret's Church, Herefordshire Owain Glynd≈µr is said to have spent his final years after his disappearance following the eventual failure of his rebellion against King Henry IV in hiding under an alternative identity with his daughter, Alys Scudamore, previously known as Alys ferch Owain Glynd≈µr, and her husband, a Herefordshire Scudamore, namely Sir John Scudamore in the Golden Valley. The Golden Valley featured in the 1993 film Shadowlands in both a painting and as an actual location. C.S. Lewis, the film's protagonist, owned a painting of a valley which to him, as a child, appeared to be heaven. Pipeline During 2008 the Golden Valley saw the construction of the National Grid‚Äôs 196 km natural gas pipeline from Felindre in Swansea to Tirley in Gloucestershire. The pipeline increases the volume of gas which can be transported from the new LNG terminals at Milford Haven to the rest of the UK.

It is also referred to as Allport's Scale of Prejudice and Discrimination or Allport's Scale of Prejudice. It was devised by psychologist Gordon Allport in 1954. The scale Allport's Scale of Prejudice goes from 1 to 5. #Antilocution: Antilocution occurs when an in-group freely purports negative images of an out-group. Hate speech is included in this stage. Although antilocution itself may not be harmful, it could set the stage for more severe outlets for prejudice (see also ethnic joke). #Avoidance: Members of the in- group actively avoid people in the out-group. No direct harm may be intended, but psychological harm often results through isolation (see also social exclusion). #Discrimination: The out-group is discriminated against by denying them opportunities and services, putting prejudice into action. Behaviors have the intention of disadvantaging the out-group by preventing them from achieving goals, getting education or jobs, etc. Examples include Jim Crow laws in the US, the Statute of Kilkenny in British Ireland, Apartheid in South Africa, the Nuremberg Laws in 1930's Germany and antisemitic laws in the Middle East. #Physical Attack: The in-group vandalizes, burns, or otherwise destroys out-group property and carries out violent attacks on individuals or groups. Physical harm is done to members of the out-group. Examples include pogroms against Jews in Europe, the lynchings of blacks and Italians in the US, ongoing violence against Hindus in Pakistan and Muslims in India. #Extermination: The in-group seeks extermination or removal of the out-group. They attempt to eliminate either the entirety or a large fraction of the undesired group of people. Examples include the Cambodian genocide, the Final Solution in Nazi Germany, the Rwandan genocide, the Armenian Genocide, the Genocide of the Hellenes and ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War. This scale should not be confused with the Religious Orientation Scale of Allport and Ross (1967), which is a measure of the maturity of an individual's religious conviction.

It is loosely bounded by Garfa to the north, the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass to the east, Jadavpur to the west and Baghajatin to the south.Santoshpur maps History of Santoshpur area Before 1947, the area of Santoshpur was actually the property of Late Rani Rashmoni, who is related to the construction of the Dakshineshwar Temple. Even today, one can find the area of Rani Rashmoni Bagan, in north Santoshpur, where one can find a pond in which it is claimed there is a Shiva temple at the bottom of the pond. The pond has certain mystical features and local people use it for bathing and other daily life purposes. In recent times, a statue of Rani Rashmoni has been constructed near one of the ghats of the pond (\\" pukur \\" in Bengali). [3] =From the fifties= This area was initially part of Jadavpur. The area was mainly shallow marshy lands and agricultural fields even as late as the seventies. Some houses were built in the fifties and sixties mostly on the eastern side of the Jadavpur Rail Station. Residents mostly East Bengali refugeesScribd article walked to the station or to the Jadavpur Bus Stand to board Bus Routes 8B or 9. The seventies saw an uptick in the number of houses constructed and spread more to the east. It was common sight at this time to see agricultural fields, small dairy operations and residential houses coexist on the same street. The new residents would pitch in their money and arrange for truckloads of dirt to be dumped on the road to make them passable during the monsoon season. =Rapid Expansion= Santoshpur started to grow faster and faster. Vacant plots were filling up fast. Agricultural lands were becoming scarce and could be found only on the other side of the Panchannagram canal (popularly called \\"khaal\\"). The cheaper land costs and proximity to the city proved to be an irresistible attraction for middle-class Bengalis. Government employees, bank employees, school teachers, college professors, and small businessmen started flocking to this new area. In the meantime, the area which were under Panchayats and saw little organized development morphed into the Jadavpur Municipality. The headquarters were established in the \\"Battala Bazaar\\" area ‚Äì which became the heart of the new area. A new permanent market was planned a few hundred meters east of the street-side market. With the incorporation of the municipality in Kolkata Municipal Corporation as part of Borough 11 & 12, Santoshpur was poised for a quantum leap. The opening of the southern stretches of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass provided the residents with the option to commute via either Jadavpur or the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. With the advent of rapid urbanization, in terms of large-scale real estate constructions, Santoshpur has seen a quantum leap in its quality of life from the late 90s; now, shopping malls and latest food chains not only make life trendy and smart, but also the complement the towering apartments in the vicinity. With the explosive population growth, traffic snarls became very common in and around Santoshpur; from the crossing at Ajoynagar to the Jadavpur railway crossing, thousands of people throng these roads, which, few years back, wore a rather deserted look. A railway overbridge, named \\"Sukanta Setu\\" over Jadavpur Railway Station connects Santoshpur Avenue with Raja SC Mullick Road, about half a kilometer to the south of the Jadavpur Bus Stand; construction of which was completed in record time. With travel time falling dramatically and new bus routes being introduced, Santoshpur became a sought after place to live for the Bengali middle-class. =Apartments and high rises= To accommodate this heavy demand, mid-rise apartment buildings started being built by real estate developers. Apartment complexes were also built in the erstwhile once-upon-a-time marshy lands by the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. With uber-cool high rise communities namely, 'Udayan', 'Hiland Park, 'Calcutta Greens', Santoshpur has been becoming more cosmopolitan. It is well known for its proximity to Metropolis mall, Jadavpur University, Jadavpur Railway station, E.M. Bypass. Through the main road, you can get state bus, private bus, mini bus, Volvo, auto and all forms of public transport available in Kolkata. Transport The area is connected with Sealdah South lines through Jadavpur railway station in north and Baghajatin railway station in South. Also New Garia (Kavi Subhash)-Dum Dum Airport metro route (Kolkata Metro Line 6) serves the Santoshpur area. Jyotirindra Nath Nandi metro station and Satyajit Ray metro station, under construction on the Kavi Subhas-Biman Bandar route (Kolkata Metro Line 6), would serve Santoshpur, Ajoy Nagar, Survey Park areas lying close to the E.M.

It was confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie, and served as a military headquarters through much of the Revolutionary War. General George Washington made it his headquarters, September 4 to 17, 1780. Following the war, it was given to Major General Baron von Steuben, who occupied it from 1783 to 1788. History The Steuben House has long been esteemed a Revolutionary landmark. Its architecture and historic furnishings recall the Bergen Dutch, an agricultural community whose language and culture blended contributions from Dutch, Angolan African, German, English, French, Scotch and Scandinavian settlers. At a place known originally as Aschatking (where the river narrows), about above the head of Newark Bay, a Swedish land-clearer named Cornelius Mattyse acquired at the juncture of Tantaqua's Creek (Cole's Brook) and the Hackensack River, in 1682. The Steuben House pictured in 2019 This was called Tantaqua's Plain, where a Hackensack sachem of that name resided with his kinfolk. David Ackerman, residing in the village of Hackensack, purchased the land from Matheus Corneliuson, son of Cornelius Matheus of Hackensack River, in 1695. He devised that portion of this tract of land lying east of Kinderkamack Road to his son, Johannes Ackerman, who built a dwelling on the Steenrapie (Kinderkamack) Road at the time of his marriage to Jannetje Lozier in 1713. A tidal gristmill was built on the Hackensack River. This mill got its power from an artificial pond: the high tide was trapped in the mouth of Cole's Brook by a dam with a special drop-gate, suspended from a horizontal timber. When the tides flowed out of the Hackensack River, the tidal millpond was slowly released through the waterwheel. Sloops pulled alongside the mill at New Bridge Landing. On March 9, 1744, a road was surveyed from Kinderkamack Road to the chosen spot on the banks of the Hackensack River where a \\"New Bridge\\" was to be erected (forming what is now Main Street, River Edge). Jan and Annetje (Ackerman) Zabriskie purchased the Johannes Ackerman mill and farm in September 1745, shortly after construction of the first draw-bridge at the narrows of the Hackensack River. This wooden span was called New Bridge to distinguish it from an older crossing several miles upstream. In 1752, Jan Zabriskie built the oldest part of the Steuben House. Its walls were built with blocks of sandstone cut from the Kinderkamack Ridge - dressed stone on the two sides of the building facing the roadway and coursed rubble on the other sides. The front door opened into a center-hall. The Zabriskie family grew wealthy from increased trade brought on by the French and Indian War (1756‚Äì1763) and doubled the size of their dwelling about 1765, increasing it from five to twelve rooms, warmed by seven fireplaces, and covering it with a fashionable gambrel roof. The gambrel roof has four slopes instead of two, providing more headroom and storage space in the garret (for this reason, many barns used a gambrel roof to increase the size of the hay mow). The Jersey Dutch also adopted the gambrel roof to span the depth of a house that was one-and-a-half to two rooms deep. New Bridge Landing was the business center of the upper Hackensack Valley. Iron made in stone furnaces along the Ramapo Mountains was carried in ox-carts to New Bridge Landing where it was loaded onto sloops, some as large as 50 ton, for shipment to market. Flour and animal feed was shipped from the mill. All kinds of wares came in from boats returning from the city. This location had an added advantage: because of the wide Hackensack Meadowlands downstream, New Bridge remained the nearest river crossing to Newark Bay until 1790. Overland traffic including farm wagons and stage coaches, going to and from New York City, crossed the river at this spot on their way into the interior parts of the country. The house was occupied as a military headquarters during much of the American Revolutionary War. General Washington headquartered here in September 1780 for 14 days when the Continental Army encamped on the Kinderkamack Ridge. While a constant arena for conflict, the following significant Revolutionary War events are associated with Historic New Bridge Landing: * November 21, 1776: British troops under Major General Vaughan attacked the American rear guard and seized the New Bridge, which American engineers were dismantling. * May 18, 1779: British and Loyalist troops under command of Captain Patrick Fergusen attacked about 40 Bergen militiamen at New Bridge. * August 18, 1779: Major Henry Lee led American troops from New Bridge, to attack the British earthworks at Paulus Hook (Jersey City). * March 23, 1780: A force of Bergen Militia and Continental troops attacked 600 British troops and German auxiliaries at New Bridge on their retreat from Hackensack and Paramus, during the two hours it took for the British to repair and cross the New Bridge. * April 15, 1780: A body of 312 British, Loyalist and German infantry, attacked and overwhelmed an American outpost at New Bridge commanded by Lieutenant Bryson. * May 30, 1780: Eight British soldiers were killed, and several wounded, by friendly fire when British troops attempted to attack a body of Bergen Militia in the Zabriskie-Steuben House at New Bridge. * July 20, 1780: Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led American troops from New Bridge on a raid against the Bull's Ferry Blockhouse. * September 4‚Äì17, 1780: General Washington made his headquarters in the Zabriskie-Steuben House during the Steenrapie encampment of the Continental Army, encompassing nearly 14,000 men. The State of New Jersey confiscated the stone mansion from Jan Zabriskie, a Loyalist, in 1781. The New Jersey Legislature gave the Zabriskie estate at New Bridge to Major General Baron von Steuben, the Inspector General of the Continental Army, on December 23, 1783 on condition that he occupy it and not rent it to a tenant. To meet these terms he had to keep a bed and servant at all times and make regular visits. His aide-de-camp, Captain Benjamin Walker, resided there, operating the mill and river dock in partnership with Jan Zabriskie. Captain Walker purchased the Zabriskie estate on Steuben's behalf in 1786. This is the only extant 18th century building that Steuben owned. Steuben renovated the war-damaged house and sold the house to back to the Zabriskie family, Jan, son of the Loyalist, in 1788. His grandson, John J. Zabriskie, died trying to free the mill waterwheel in 1793. Andrew Zabriskie, a cousin, purchased the Steuben House in 1815. His descendants owned the property until 1909. The Steuben House pictured in 1936 The Steuben House Commission was created in 1926 to purchase Baron Steuben's home at New Bridge. The State took possession of the historic mansion and of ground for $9,000 on June 27, 1928. It was renovated and opened as the museum headquarters of the Bergen County Historical Society in September 1939. The Steuben House is listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places. The Bergen County Historical Society continued stewardship of the site by purchase of land between the Steuben House and the encroaching autoparts yard in 1944. In 1954, the Society was able to persuade the County of Bergen to divert the planned 4-lane highway to the north of the site instead of alongside the historic site. The highway bridge opened in 1956 and the one-lane 1889 swing bridge was closed to vehicles. It remains open for pedestrians. Demarest House and Westervelt-Thomas Barn The house is now the cornerstone of this historic district, spanning both sides of the river. Three additional buildings were moved onto the adjacent property of the Bergen County Historical Society, a private non-profit volunteer organization. The Demarest House was moved here from New Milford in 1956 and is maintained by the Blauvelt Demarest Foundation. The Westervelt-Thomas Barn was relocated from Washington Township in 1958. The County of Bergen moved the Campbell- Christie House here to lands of the Bergen County Historical Society in 1977. The Society erected a working replica of a Bergen Dutch Out-Kitchen in 1991 and an outhouse in 2009. The Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission was established by law in 1995 to coordinate and implement all private and governmental plans and activities at Historic New Bridge Landing Park, which was named one of three new urban state parks in 2004. 2007 flood The Steuben House suffered little in the way of permanent damage in the April 2007 nor'easter. However, Bergen County Historical Society collections that had been moved to the second floor in previous floods, had been left on the first floor. Thus, numerous artifacts were damaged or destroyed. Volunteers open the New Jersey State Historic site for special events.

Chary, The History of Bulgaria, ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 181 () (24 March 1843 - 24 January 1903) was a leading Bulgarian liberal politician who served as Prime Minister on four occasions. Early years Born in Koprivshtitsa, his older brother Lyuben initially became more well known as a writer and leading member of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee.Duncan M. Perry, Stefan Stambolov and the Emergence of Modern Bulgaria: 1870-1895, Duke University Press, 1993, p. 246 Initially educated at the Greek language school at Enez, Karavelov was an apprentice weaver until he left for Moscow at the age of 16. Here he studied history and philology at Moscow State University, before serving as a tutor to a number of prominent families. He also served in the Russian Army during the Russo- Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878. In 1878, the Russians appointed him the deputy governor of Svishtov, before he was elected to the new Assembly for the Liberal Party.Charles Jelavich & Barbara Jelavich, Establishment of the Balkan National States: 1804-1918, University of Washington Press, 1977, p. 160 Prime Minister Karavelov was first offered the premiership in 1879 when Prince Alexander asked him to head up a coalition administration. Karavelov rejected the offer however, as Alexander required an anti-Russian government that would curb freedoms, both tenets being unacceptable to the Liberals.Perry, Stefan Stambolov and the Emergence of Modern Bulgaria, p. 50 He first served as Prime Minister from 1880‚Äì1881 but was effectively declared persona non grata when Alexander suspended the constitution in 1881.Francisca De Haan, Krasimira Daskalova, Anna Loutfi, Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms: Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe, 19th and 20th Centuries, Central European University Press, 2006, p. 231 A number of Liberals followed Karavelov into exile although a sizeable group remained in Bulgaria, creating a division in the party.R. J. Crampton, A Concise History of Bulgaria, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 93 He relocated to Plovdiv, in the semi-autonomous Eastern Rumelia, where he found work as a teacher, before returning to Bulgaria proper in 1884. He also served as a Mayor of Plovdiv during his exile. Karavelov then returned as Prime Minister from 1884 to 1886, overseeing Bulgarian unification and the Serbo-Bulgarian War. It is claimed that in 1885 Karavelov was involved in a Russian-led plot to oust Alexander along with his wife Ekaterina, although it is unknown if the Russian envoys convinced the Karavelovs to become fully involved in the scheme.Perry, Stefan Stambolov and the Emergence of Modern Bulgaria, p. 70 He joined Stefan Stambolov and others as a member of the Regency Council after the abdication of Alexander of Bulgaria in 1886, serving a brief third spell as Prime Minister in August of that year. His reigns as Prime Minister where characterized by close association with Russia. Karavelov was criticised as a poor public speaker who let his ego determine many of his political decisions, although supporters lauded him as a pragmatist and a statesman with a keen academic mind. Out of favour As a committed liberal, he became associated with the Democratic Party after the party split. He broke from his former ally Stambolov and was imprisoned 1891-1894, after being accused of instigating the assassination of government Minister Hristo Belchev. During this and other shorter prison spells under Stambolov Karavelov was subjected to torture. He was amnestied in 1894 with the resignation of Stambolov.Leon Trotsky, The Balkan wars: 1912-13 : the war correspondence of Leon Trotsky, Resistance Books, 1980, p. 475 Later years Karavelov was a founder of the Democratic Party around the turn of the century. In contrast to Karavelov's earlier opinions, the new group favoured a free hand in foreign policy but preferred a closer relationship with the western European powers rather than Russia.Jelavich & Jelavich, Establishment of the Balkan National States, p. 193 By this point he was recognised as the \\"grand old man\\" of democratic liberalism in Bulgaria and was the centre of a wide circle of influential followers in the nation's capital Sofia.Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, Equality & Revolution: Women's Rights in the Russian Empire, 1905-1917, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010, p. 37 He briefly returned in 1901 to lead the party's first government.

He rose to the rank of Admiral, and served briefly as colonial governor of Newfoundland. Family and early life Duff was born c. 1721, among the youngest of more than thirty children of Patrick Duff of Craigston, by Craigston's second wife. Little is known about his early life, but a story that does survive attests to his father's fecundity and possibly also to Robert's own spirited approach. Walking in his garden the father, Patrick Duff, came across a small boy and enquired 'And wha's laddie are you?' to which his son, the future Admiral Robert Duff, replied 'Dinna ye ken your ain son Robbie, ye auld fool!'. Robert joined the navy and was listed a lieutenant by 9 March 1739. He was advanced to commander on 4 December 1744, and by 1746 was in command of the bomb vessel , serving off the Scottish coast. Duff received the command of the 44-gun on 23 October, and remained in her off the Irish and English coasts until the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 that ended the War of the Austrian Succession. Seven Years' War Duff's next ship was the 50-gun , which he joined in 1755. He spent several years cruising, either independently or as part of the main fleet, and in 1758 was part of Commodore Richard Howe's squadron defending the expeditions against St Malo, Cherbourg and St Cas. He became senior officer of a small squadron stationed off Brittany in 1759, watching the French fleet in Morbihan, while a fleet under Edward Hawke blockaded Brest, France. While at anchor in Quiberon Bay on 20 November, his scouts reported a large French fleet to the south of Belle √éle. Duff hurried his squadron, consisting of four 50-gun ships and four frigates, out to sea while the French chased them. Before they could be caught, the main fleet under Hawke came up and overran the French, defeating them in the decisive Battle of Quiberon Bay. Duff was then appointed to the 80-gun and went out with her to the West Indies with Rear-Admiral George Brydges Rodney's fleet. Duff saw action at the capture of Martinique during January and February 1762, but owing to his seniority, he refused to serve as Rodney's flag-captain, and was sent home. In 1764 he married Helen Duff, the daughter of his cousin, the first Earl of Fife. Duff was promoted to rear-admiral of the blue on 31 March 1775, and in April was sent out as commander-in-chief at Newfoundland. His posting was brief, in 1776 he became rear-admiral of the white and in September 1777 he was appointed to the command of the Mediterranean Fleet, with the 60-gun as his flagship. American War of Independence By now a rear-admiral of the red, he supported the British forces defending Gibraltar from Don Antonio Barcelo's fleet when the siege there broke out in 1779, but had limited forces at his disposal and he was recalled early in 1780. He had been promoted to vice- admiral of the blue on 29 January 1778, and was advanced to vice-admiral of the white later that year, but held no further command after his return to England in 1780. Later years and death His portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds for Greenwich Hospital. Increasingly ill with gout during his later years, he died at Queensferry on 6 June 1787, his death being attributed to an attack of gout in the stomach. He had a number of children by his marriage to Helen Duff: * Jean (1765-1839), in 1791 married her cousin (Robert's nephew) James Clerk-Rattray of Edinburgh, later Baron of the Exchequer * A son (b.1766, dsp) * Robert William (b.1767, grandfather of Robert Duff) * A child (b. 1775, d. young) * Adam (1775‚Äì1840) * James Alexander Duff (1777‚Äì1800) Another of Robert Duff's relations, his grandnephew George Duff, achieved distinction in the navy. He was part of Horatio Nelson's fleet, and was assigned to command the inshore squadron watching the enemy in Cadiz prior to the Battle of Trafalgar. He commanded the 74-gun during the battle, and was killed during the fighting. Notes References *.

Imbaba is also the name of an adjacent administrative centre () in rural Giza Governorate, which has 18 villages in its jurisdiction. History For centuries Imbaba was the final destination for camels brought from as far as Sudan and the Horn of Africa, to be sold in the village's Friday market. The market still exists, but is no longer as important as it was up to the turn of the 20th century due to increasing urbanisation. A map created by the General Authority for Physical Planning in 2012, shows details of areas within Imbaba which were unplanned, and that at the time, were considered unsafe. Imbaba is densely populated. Pigeon breeding is a favorite activity of some of the neighborhood residents with access to rooftops. =The Siege of Imbaba= In late 1992, the \\"Islamic Group\\" (al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya) expanded its influence in parts of Imbaba. In November, the group purportedly announced the establishment of the \\"Emirate of Imbaba\\" (some accounts claim that foreign news media coined the term, not the group itself). This challenge to the sovereignty of the Egyptian state triggered the siege of Imbaba, beginning on December 8. In its course, the government deployed over 12,000 police and State Security forces, along with one hundred personnel carriers and bulldozers, all of which put an end to the Emirate.Singerman, Diane. ‚ÄúThe Siege of Imbaba, Egypt‚Äôs Internal ‚ÄòOther,‚Äô and the Criminalization of Politics.‚Äù In Cairo Contested: Governance, Urban Space, and Global Modernity, ed.

It occurred during France's Egyptian Campaign and was the battle where Napoleon put into use one of his significant contributions to tactics, the massive divisional square. Napoleon named the battle after the Egyptian pyramids, although they were only faintly visible on the horizon when the battle took place. Name origins The origin of the name Imbaba is not certain; however, the word specifically pronounced \\"Embaba\\" in the Tigre language and Tigrinya language means flower.

A back-to-back user agent operates between both end points of a communications session and divides the communication channel into two call legs, and mediates all SIP signaling between the endpoints of the session, from establishment to termination. As all control messages for each call flow through the B2BUA, a service provider may implement value-added features available during the call. In the originating call leg, the B2BUA acts as a user agent server (UAS) and processes the request as a user agent client (UAC) to the destination end, handling the signaling between end points back-to-back. A B2BUA maintains complete state for the calls it handles. Each side of a B2BUA operates as a standard SIP user agent network element as specified in RFC 3261. In addition to call management, a B2BUA may provide billing services, internetworking for protocol conversions, and hiding of network-internal topology and information. B2BUAs are often implemented in media gateways to bridge the media streams, in addition to the signaling path, for full control over the session.

After a two-year series of continuous sundry skirmishes in the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul) and along the border of this country with Brazil, the advancing Argentine Army (including Orientals) engaged in combat with the Brazilian Army. Background The Banda Oriental was incorporated as a Brazilian Province in 1822, when Brazil became independent from Portugal. The centralized government, under Brazilian Emperor Pedro I, led to many revolts inside Brazil. Seeing a chance to break the rule of a foreign nation over their country, some Orientals raised the flag of rebellion against the Brazilian government in 1825. At first, the fight did not attract much attention from the Brazilian government, which was dealing with revolts even in Rio de Janeiro at the time. Nevertheless, as the rebellion spread fast, Pedro I had to gather an army by any way that he could to send to \\"Cisplatina\\" (the province's name under Brazilian control). The Army was, at first, led by Pedro I himself. Political problems forced him to return to the capital without getting close to the battlefield. By December 1826, the command was given to General Felisberto Caldeira Brant, Marquis of Barbacena. By then, the appeal the Orientals sent to Buenos Aires brought Argentina into the conflict. The Buenos Aires leadership saw a chance to bring the Banda Oriental back into the Argentine Confederation as a province. General Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear was appointed as commander of the Republican Army. On January 20, 1827, Alvear moved to the border with Brazil. He attacked some small towns and villages and successfully tried to bring Barbacena to him. Battle Scene of the battle By February 18, the Republican Army reached a stream of Santa Maria River. Alvear had previously chosen that place to maximize his advantage in cavalry. The Brazilian Imperial Army arrived in the battlefield the next day. Refusing some objections over the exhaustion of the army, Barbacena prepared his forces for action as soon as possible the following day. Some historians say that Alvear misled Barbacena to believe that he was pursuing only the rear of the Republican Army. That is why he was anxious to take care of that part of Republican Army and to fight Alvear's main force in a later battle. Believing so, Barbacena took the offensive and sent his cavalry and infantry toward the 1st Corps of the Republican Army, under command of Oriental leader Juan Antonio Lavalleja. The Imperial Forces crossed the stream as if to encircle Lavalleja's men. At first, the Oriental cavalry tried to block the passage of the 1st Imperial Army Division. Soon, they were pushed back by the enemy, which managed to take control of the artillery pieces under Colonel Felix Olazabal. Alvear then counterattacked with his cavalry. While he would take care of the 2nd Division on the center of the Imperial Army, Colonel Julian Laguna would attack the extreme left of the Brazilian forces, which were formed by only volunteers. Colonel Soler would lead his men onto the 1st Division. As Alvear planned, the open fields proved to be more suitable for cavalry units than for infantry. Only the center of the Imperial Army kept its position. The infantry there formed squares to repel any attempt made by 2nd Corps of the enemy cavalry to subdue them. Only when it was clear that the Republican Army could encircle the 2nd Division did it withdraw from the battlefield. The Republican Army could not pursue the enemy. The lack of proper means made Alvear order his men to put fire to the battlefield and to leave the scene. The battle ended with a tactical victory for the Republicans since Barbacena could not march on Buenos Aires, as he had planned, but with no strategic gain for either side. Aftermath The war went on for one more year with inconclusive frays on land between small groups of men on each side. The Empire of Brazil achieved naval dominance with the battle of Monte Santiago shortly after the republican triumph in Ituzaing√≥. On the ground, the cities of Montevideo and Colonia del Sacramento remained under the control of Brazil. Therefore, also the actions by the Navies played a role in the outcome of the conflict. Speaking about it, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n was very clear about that. He said to Tom√°s Guido in July 1827: Eventually, in 1828 a treaty was signed between Brazil and Argentina that granted its independence as present-day Uruguay.

Genentech : The Beginnings of Biotech, University of Chicago Press, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central According to Swanson, he was taught from an early age that his generation would do better than the last generation of his family. It was because of this that his family wanted him to be the first to obtain a college degree. His family was particularly interested in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Much to his family's pride, Swanson was accepted into MIT in 1965. Even though he was majoring in chemistry, he realized later during his undergraduate education that he preferred working with people, rather than in research. What follows is an excerpt from a 1996 interview that describes how he came to this realization: \\"At the end of my junior year, I... got a summer job working for a chemical company... One of the things I discovered was that I enjoyed people more than things. So I said, 'Gee, this probably isn't going to be what I'd want to do all my life,'\\". As a result, Swanson petitioned MIT to be able to take the first year's courses at the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management for a master's degree, and they allowed him to do so. Thanks to the graduate courses he took, he realized that he was particularly interested in two things: organizational development, and the commercialization of innovative ideas. He graduated from MIT in 1970, with an undergraduate degree in chemistry and a master of science degree in management.  Early career  After graduating from MIT, Swanson took a job at Citibank, where he managed a venture investment group. His performance pleased his supervisors, and he and a colleague were chosen to open a San Francisco office for Citicorp Venture Capital. However, the new Citicorp investments were not doing well. One particular failure, which Swanson later believed to have been a lucky break, was the bankruptcy of Antex, a science based company that Citicorp had invested in. He worked with Eugene Kleiner, another Citicorp executive, to attempt to get some money out of the company's bankruptcy. Eugene Kleiner was the cofounder of the venture capital partnership Kleiner & Perkins. Swanson left Citicorp and joined Kleiner & Perkins in 1974, under the recommendation of Eugene Kleiner himself. As an associate, Swanson spent a lot of time and effort attempting to convince the heads of the science company Cetus, one which Kleiner and Perkins had invested in, to pursue genetic recombination projects. His interest in the technology had been piqued in a lunch with famed scientist and Nobel laureate Donald Glaser. However, the company refused to take on such a risky endeavor, and Kleiner & Perkins parted ways with the company. This falling out was one of the main reasons for the group's decision to advise Swanson to look for another job. Kleiner & Perkins had decided that they would rather work alone, and by the end of 1975, Swanson's position there would be terminated.  Beginnings of Genentech  A young Swanson now found himself unemployed. Swanson was interviewing almost daily, attempting to find a job. However, he was still fascinated by the potential of recombinant DNA technology, and decided to cold call scientists working on the technology, with the hope that one of them would be interested in commercializing it. One of the scientists he contacted, Herbert Boyer, expressed interest but was hesitant of meeting up with Swanson at first. Boyer was an academic scientist, and was not well versed on the matters of business. Swanson convinced Boyer to meet, for a short time, at his University of California, San Francisco lab. The short meeting was extended to three hours, and Boyer came out determined to commercialize the technology he had helped pioneer. He would deal with the science behind the product, whereas Swanson would work on obtaining funds, and managing the organization as a whole. The two agreed to form a partnership, and each put down $500 to cover legal fees. Swanson made the decision to pursue the creation of the company full-time, rather than obtain a job at an established institution or company. He explains his logic in an interview: \\"(I told myself) \\"Look, I think this is important. If I don't do this, I'm not going to like myself so much for not having given it a shot.\\" So that was what made that decision.\\" Swanson then set out to identify their first marketable product, and quickly focused on the human protein insulin. From a scientific standpoint, it was a well characterized protein, whose structure had already been elucidated, making it easier to work with, in theory. Additionally, the widely available insulin at the time was pig insulin, and many people presented allergic reactions to this insulin. Human insulin, then, was preferable, for it was believed that people would not have allergic reactions to it. From a business standpoint, there was a large market for insulin; at the time, world sales were greater than $100 million, and growing. Boyer agreed that the insulin hormone should be their first target molecule. After concluding the market research, Swanson prepared Genentech's first business proposal by March 1976. It was with this proposal that Swanson pitched Genentech to Kleiner & Perkins. Perkins later explained that they considered the technical risks to be enormous: \\"(The risk of failure was) Very high. I figured better than 50‚Äì50 we'd lose it... (However) If it worked, the rewards would be obvious.\\". Boyer's scientific expertise and Swanson's business plan convinced the venture capitalists. While acknowledging the tremendous risk associated with the company, Kleiner and Perkins promised to invest $100,000 in Genentech. This was just a small fraction of Kleiner and Perkins's $8 million venture capital fund.  Career at Genentech  Because of the Kleiner and Perkins investment, Swanson and Boyer dissolved their partnership and created the legal entity Genentech. Kleiner and Perkins provided $100,000 on the May closing, and acquired 20,000 shares of preferred stock from Genentech. Swanson was made the president and treasurer of Genentech, and received a $2,500 per month salary, along with 25,000 shares. This marked the end of Swanson's unemployment, and the beginning of his career at Genentech. With funding secured, and the organizational structure formed, the first logical step forward was to begin experimenting with the procedure for the synthesis of insulin. Since Genentech lacked any laboratories of its own, the Boyer lab, as well as two other labs in the San Francisco area, were to be subcontracted to carry out the experiments. However, the scientists quickly realized that a step wise approach would be more practical; rather than immediately engineer a bacterium that synthesized insulin, they would engineer a bacterium that could synthesize somatostatin, a smaller hormone. Swanson resisted at first, since he believed that ‚ÄúIf you are going to go for something, go for the real thing.‚Äù the \\"real thing\\" being insulin, in this case. He eventually agreed, albeit grudgingly. With a new research goal set up, Swanson proceeded to establish official research agreements with the institutions. He set up research agreements with the University of California and the City of Hope. Then, in early 1977, Swanson began a second round of funding, to jumpstart the somatostatin research. He raised approximately $850,000 by February, enough money to fund the somatostatin research projects. By August 1977, the research teams managed to create the first bacterium capable of synthesizing somatostatin. This was the proof of concept that the fledgling company sought. On December 2, 1977, Swanson and the scientists held a press conference announcing their findings. Following their success with the proof of concept, Swanson then directed the scientists to pursue the creation of a bacterium that synthesized human insulin. Two other scientific teams were already attempting to carry out such a project, but Swanson moved quickly to ensure that they synthesized it first. By early 1978, his priorities were to obtain a lab space for the scientists, corporate contracts, and more funding for Genentech. In order to attract the best scientists, Swanson, with the assistance of Boyer, tried to create an attractive environment for academic scientists. It was because of this that scientists at Genentech were allowed to publish their findings in scientific journals. The restriction was that they could publish only after the appropriate patents had already been filed. By February 1978, Swanson leased a 10,000 square foot section of an airfreight warehouse, which would serve as Genentech's first lab space. Later that year, Swanson also secured a partnership with Eli Lily; Genentech would receive $50,000 a month to pursue the human insulin project. By August 1978, the Genentech scientists were able to synthesize human insulin, and in that same month, Swanson and colleagues negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract with Eli Lilly. The big company-small company relationship they developed became the eventual template for other biotechnology start ups. While there was still plenty of work to be done on the human insulin synthesis, the new stream of revenues and the significant amount of media coverage meant that Genentech could pursue other research projects. By 1979, Genentech had projects on interferons, animal growth hormones, hepatitis B vaccines, and the hormone thymosin. By 1980, Swanson decided that they should raise money by making Genentech public. This was due to a variety of factors. Genentech needed more money to continue its development, and Swanson believed that the public interest in the technology should be capitalized on. The initial public offering took place on October 14, 1980, and it was the largest IPO ever, at that moment in history, with Genentech raising 35 million dollars. From here on, Swanson would focus on pursuing his vision of Genentech as a self sustainable biotechnology company, not a contract research operation. He believed that recombinant growth hormones had a large market in the United States, and that they would be key for Genentech's corporate evolution. By October 18, 1985, the FDA approved the human growth hormone, developed almost entirely by Genentech, for sale in the United States, under the commercial name Protropin. In just two decades, Protropin sales exceeded $2 billion. Genentech had been able to manufacture, receive federal approval for, and market its own product, marking the successful execution of Swanson's plan to form out of Genentech a self sustainable biotech firm. Swanson left his position as CEO in 1990, taking on the position of chairman until his retirement from Genentech in 1996.  Legacy  Robert Swanson's legacy can still be found to this day through the company he cofounded and led. Genentech is still producing drugs and treatments to this day, and some of his policies, such as allowing company scientists to publish, are still in place. Genentech scored many firsts under Swanson's leadership, such as developing the first drug produced via genetic engineering, being the first biotechnology company to go public, and being the first biotechnology company to sell its own drug. These accomplishments have earned Genentech, and Swanson, a place in the history of the biotechnology industry.

Wilson was Acting Director from 1938 to 1939 following the death of Hubert S. Martin; he was elected in 1939 and remained in office until 1951. He then became Honorary President of WOSM for four years. Scouting Baden-Powell visited India in 1921, where he met and recruited Colonel Wilson, who was then Senior Deputy Commissioner of Police in Calcutta, and in his free time was serving as Calcutta's District Scout Commissioner. Colonel Wilson ran Gilwell Park for The Scout Association in the early 1920s. He served as Director of the Boy Scouts International Bureau for 15 years, tasked with co-ordinating various Scout movements within countries and between them prior to the establishment of World Scout Regions. After retirement, he served as Honorary President of the Boy Scouts International Committee for a further four years. To encourage the creation of Rovering in the Boy Scouts of America, the first Wood Badge course held in the United States was a Rover Scout Wood Badge course, directed by Wilson. Wilson introduced an international Scout badge in 1939-a silver fleur-de-lis or arrowhead badge on a purple background surrounded by the names of the five continents in silver within a circular frame. The wearing of it was not universal, but was confined to past and present members of the International Committee and staff of the Bureau. A flag of similar design followed, the flying of which was restricted to international Scout gatherings.

It is adjacent to Arezzo, the capital of the province of the same name. History Capolona was originally known as Campus Leonis or Caput leonis. In 943, a deed of confirmation mentions Campus Leonis as being the property of a Bernardo, a noble of Arezzo. The name Campus Leonis was later corrupted to Capolona. The core of Capolona grew around the in Campo Leonis. The Abbey was founded in 972 by the Marquis Ugo di Toscana and his wife Giuditta. It was placed under the protection of Emperors Otto III, Carrado II and Arrigo III who gave the Abbey jurisdiction over several of the castles and courts in the diocese of Arezzo. In 1241, the Arezzo military besieged Capolona and destroyed it. The Abbott was forced to surrender all the castles and lands under control of the Abbey. Their ownership was passed to the municipality. These were in turn passed to the dominion of the Tarlati di Pietramala, in 1384, after the Arezzo territories surrendered to Firenze, becoming part of the Fiorentino Republic. In 1527, Capolona was devastated by the army of Carlo di Borbone, General of the Emperor Carlos V. The Commune of Capolona was formed in 1845 when the hamlets of Lorenzano and Baciano were combined with several areas which had been part of the municipality of Talla. Geography The commune lies between above sea level.  Economy The workforce in Capolona is made up of 1,892 workers, 39.40% of the residents of the Commune. Industrial firms account for 57.77% of the employment work force in Capolona with 185 firms employing 1,093 persons. The next largest sector is the administrative sector, providing 272 jobs (14.38% of the workforce) in 16 offices. The third largest employer is the service industry. 104 firms employ 178 persons, employing 9.41% of the work force.

It was named after King Charles II, who gave ¬£500 to assist the British sugar cane plantations. The 1690 capture of Fort Charles by the French Caribbean forces was the reason for the construction of the Brimstone Hill Fortress above it, a National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site which overlooks this site. Charles Fort was a military post from at least 1666, and rebuilt by English Governor Thomas Hill by 1689. By 1736, the fort had 40 guns. The fort was abandoned in 1854.

The main purpose is to train its members musically for The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square (Choir), which is a more rigorous musical institution. 271x271px About In response to a charge from Gordon B. Hinckley, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Choir to \\"get better and better,\\" the Chorale was organized in 1999 as an in-service program for current Choir members, as well as a training venue for its applicants. The first session of the Chorale began in July 1999, with Mack Wilberg as music director and a previous Choir director, Jerold Ottley, along with his wife, soloist and renowned teacher, JoAnn, co-directing the training school. Under the leadership of Wilberg and the Ottleys, the Chorale conducted two 12-week sessions each year. Each session allowed the Chorale the opportunity to focus on major choral works‚Äîa luxury not often afforded within the rigorous schedule of the Choir. In the past, the Chorale has performed such works as the St. Matthew Passion by Bach, King David by Arthur Honegger, Requiem by Mozart and Saul by Handel. Since 2009, Ryan Murphy, who is also the Choir's associate music director, has been the Chorale's director. As of June 2020, the training school is directed by Cherilyn Worthen. On May 8, 2020, it was announced that the Temple Square Chorale would be known as the Chorale at Temple Square, in accordance with the Choir's new visual identity. The Chorale's membership changes with each new three-month session. Each session includes new applicants who have passed the audition requirements for the Choir, which includes taped and in-person vocal auditions, as well as a detailed music aptitude exam. Additionally, Murphy works with Wilberg, now the Choir's music director, to identify current Choir members who participate to complete in-service training with the Chorale to hone and improve their musical skills. Total membership of the Chorale varies with each session, but it usually numbers between 70 and 80 members. The culmination of each three- month session is the performance of a major choral piece. The Chorale is accompanied in these performances by members of the Orchestra at Temple Square.

In 1934, the Civilian Conservation Corps began developing the site. The park and town bear the name of the Ponca tribe, who inhabited the area before European settlement, and whose chief, Standing Bear, won a celebrated court battle to have the Indian declared a \\"person\\" under U.S. law. Natural history The park is noted for its biodiversity. Eastern woodland flowers such as bloodroot, Canada violet, phlox and sweet cicely can be found growing among prairie plants, including yucca, clover, and larkspur. The wild plum and gooseberry thickets were also noted by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who passed these bluffs with their Corps of Discovery in the summer of 1804. Forested ravines and hillsides contain bur oak, basswood, elm, black walnut and hackberry. White-tailed deer and wild turkey are commonly seen. Coyotes, red and gray foxes, raccoons and bobcats might also be spotted. This area is also known for the concentrations of waterfowl that congregate during the spring and fall migrations. The barred owl is a vocal resident, and wintering bald eagles are often sighted. Activities and amenities Twenty- two miles of hiking and biking trails wind through the deep ravines and hilltop ridges of the park. The Three State Overlook offers a scenic blufftop view of Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. An interactive museum at park headquarters includes exhibits about the Missouri River and its history. The park offers a fishing pond, swimming pool, campgrounds, and cabins.

The purpose of such a test is to provide a quantitative statistical measure of humanness, which may subsequently be used to optimize the performance of artificial intelligence systems intended to imitate human responses. McKinstry gathered approximately 80,000 propositions that could be answered yes or no, e.g.: * Is Earth a planet? * Was Abraham Lincoln once President of the United States? * Is the sun bigger than my foot? * Do people sometimes lie? He called these propositions Mindpixels. These questions test both specific knowledge of aspects of culture, and basic facts about the meaning of various words and concepts. It could therefore be compared with the SAT, intelligence testing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program could be considered intelligent at all. According to McKinstry, a program able to do much better than chance on a large number of MIST questions would be judged to have some level of intelligence and understanding. For example, on a 20-question test, if a program were guessing the answers at random, it could be expected to score 10 correct on average. But the probability of a program scoring 20 out of 20 correct by guesswork is only one in 220, i.e. one in 1,048,576; so if a program were able to sustain this level of performance over several independent trials, with no prior access to the propositions, it should be considered intelligent. Discussion McKinstry criticized existing approaches to artificial intelligence such as chatterbots, saying that his questions could \\"kill\\" AI programs by quickly exposing their weaknesses. He contrasted his approach, a series of direct questions assessing an AI's capabilities, to the Turing test and Loebner Prize method of engaging an AI in undirected typed conversation. Critics of the MIST have noted that it would be easy to \\"kill\\" a McKinstry-style AI too, due to the impossibility of supplying it with correct answers to all possible yes/no questions by ways of a finite set of human-generated Mindpixels: the fact that an AI can answer the question \\"Is the sun bigger than my foot?\\" correctly does not mean that it can answer variations like \\"Is the sun bigger than (my hand  my liver  an egg yolk  Alpha Centauri A  ...)\\" correctly, too. However, the late McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, knowledgeable entity (on a par with humans) would be able to work out answers such as (yes  yes  yes  don't know  ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named. In other words, the MIST was intended as a test of AI, not as a suggestion for implementing AI. It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator's gullibility than of the machine's intelligence. According to this argument, a human's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the ELIZA effect, a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, anthropomorphizing the program. The response, suggested by Alan Turing's essay \\"Can Machines Think?\\", is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent. The dispute is thus over what it means for a program to have \\"real\\" intelligence, and by what signs it can be detected. A similar debate exists in the controversy over great ape language, in which nonhuman primates are said to have learned some aspects of sign languages but the significance of this learning is disputed.

Ulve√∏yne series  Ulve√∏yne consists of 25 books released between March 1996 and February 2000. A short novel based on part of the second book, Trellf√∏dt (Born To Slavery), was released in August/September 1997. Egmont began to re-release the series in 2007 after the success of its sequel, Rimfrost. Ulve√∏yne means \\"wolf eyes\\" and refers to the main character's grey eyes. The eye color is especially catching as Ulva's skin is dark and her hair is black due to her paternal grandmother being from Egypt. Ulve√∏yne centers around Ulva, a young slavegirl from Norway. It begins about a year before she's born, and then follows her as she grows up in slavery, then as she's sold at a market and later kills a man after an attack. She escapes into the mountains and runs into many dangers and difficulties, including being taken in by the \\"mountain people\\", a tall, magical people who live inside the mountains. They are also semi-immortal. = Audiobooks = Cappelen Damm Publishing House began releasing the series as audiobooks in 2020. As of June 2020, the first four books have been made available with all of them read by Lena Meieran.  Rimfrost series  Rimfrost consists of 14 books released between early 2007 and March 10, 2008. Rimfrost means 'white frost' and is a reference to the main character's unnaturally white hair. Like her mother, she has grey eyes. Rimfrost follows Rime, Ulva's only child, and begins about 180 years after Ulve√∏yne ended. Rime is a healer and survives by the money she earns by helping people. Unlike her mother, Rime was born free, and she does not age due to her father, Arolin's heritage. Her appearance is that of a 19-20-year-old woman with long, snow-white hair. Arolin's people have 1-3 'gifts', giving them special abilities. Rime's abilities are healing and being able to shape rocks however she wants. This includes, but is not limited to creating better steps and places to hold while climbing, creating a musical fountain, and making large boulders move as if alive. When the first book begins she is a widow with several adult children and adult grandchildren. However, due to not aging she moves around so as not to cause suspicion. The 'mountain people' will occasionally have children with human women, and their children will inherit certain abilities including semi-immortality. The first generation stops aging in the late teens/the early twenties (like Rime), the second generation in their 40s, and the third generation in their 60s. Subsequent generations are all human.

Early life and education Zell was born at Fort Benning, a United States Army post located southeast of the city of Columbus, Georgia. While growing up in Los Angeles, California, he began studying music at an early age, starting first with the violin and later moving on to the trumpet. His first attempt to audition for Lawrence Welk came when Zell was fifteen years old. Welk's orchestra was playing at the Hollywood Palladium and when he asked if he could play a trumpet solo for him, Welk, although impressed with his talent and moxie, thought that he was too young but told him to see him again when he was a bit older and had more experience. Career After completing high school, Zell played for the Freddy Martin and Russ Morgan bands before he got his draft notice. He served in the army from 1965 to 1968. During his time in the army, he played for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) band known as The Commanders along with Dave Edwards and Richard Maloof, future Welk musicians. In early 1968, while with the NORAD band, Zell had a second chance to audition for Welk. Zell was asked to do a television commercial for U.S. Army recruiting and part of the job was to do an interview for the Welk show and to play trumpet for the band. After his performance on that show, Welk hired him into the band upon his completion of his military service which was nine months away. From 1968 until the television series ended in 1982, Zell was one of The Lawrence Welk Show's most popular musicians and was often featured in trumpet solos, including \\"At the Cross\\", \\"Hot Lips\\" and \\"A String of Pearls\\". As a born-again Christian, he is also involved in gospel ministry, pursuing both Christian and secular music, doing many concert dates and making albums.

A Welcome to Country is a ritual or formal ceremony performed at many events held in Australia, intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular Aboriginal clan or language group who are recognised as Traditional Owners of the land. The Welcome must be performed by a recognised elder of the group. Welcomes to Country are sometimes accompanied by traditional smoking ceremonies, music or dance. Where an elder is not available to perform the Welcome, or there is not a recognised Traditional Owner, an Acknowledgement of Country may be offered instead. The term \\"Country\\" has a particular meaning and significance to Aboriginal peoples, encompassing an inter-dependent relationship between an individual or a people and their ancestral or traditional lands and seas. The connection to land involves culture, spirituality, language, law/lore, kin relationships and identity. The Welcome to Country has been a long tradition among Aboriginal Australian groups to welcome peoples from other areas. Today it serves also as a symbol which signifies the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' presence in Australia before colonisation and an end to their past exclusion from Australian history and society, aiding to reconciliation with Australia's First Nations. Since 2008, a Welcome to Country has been incorporated into the ceremonial opening of the Parliament of Australia occurring after each federal election.  History  =Aboriginal history and relationship with land= In Aboriginal culture prior to European settlement, each clan's survival was dependent upon its understanding of food, water and other resources within its own \\"Country\\" ‚Äì a discrete area of land to which it had more or less exclusive claim. Traditional ownership has been legally recognised under native title in Australia since the Native Title Act 1993. Connection to country (often spelt with a capital C) means more than just the land or waters in Aboriginal culture. There is no equivalent in the English language to describe that which permeates all aspects of existence: culture, spirituality, language, law, family and identity. Aboriginal people did not own land as property in the past, but their relationship to an area of land provides a deep sense of \\"identity, purpose and belonging\\", and is a relationship of reciprocity and respect. Country includes all living things in the environment: people, plants and animals. It also embraces the seasons, stories and creation spirits. \\" The history of a people with an area (\\"Country\\") can go back for thousands of years, and the relationship with the land is nurtured and sustained by cultural knowledge and by the environment. Disconnection from the land can impact health and wellbeing. This connection is also reflected in such phrases as \\"caring for country\\" or \\"living on country\\", and related to the importance of land rights and native title. AIATSIS summary =Evolution of Welcomes to Country= Welcomes to Country are a form of Aboriginal ceremony dating back many thousands of years, used to welcome other peoples from other areas. The 1973 Aquarius Festival held in Nimbin, New South Wales by the Australian Union of Students (AUS) has been documented as Australia's first welcome to Country although it was not called this at the time. Organisers of the alternative lifestyle festival, considered Australia's \\"Woodstock\\", were challenged by indigenous activist Gary Foley to seek permission from traditional owners to hold the festival on their land. San people from the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, including artist Bauxhau Stone, were sent out by AUS students to invite Aboriginal people to the festival, and funding from the Whitlam government paid for many busloads to travel to the festival. An estimated 200 to 800 Indigenous Australians attended the two-week festival, marking a significant kindling of relationships with Australia's counterculture. A ceremony was conducted by Uncle Lyle Roberts and song man Uncle Dickee Donnelly, the last known initiated men of the area. The first second-recorded Welcome to Country occurred in 1976, when entertainers Ernie Dingo and Richard Walley developed a ceremony to welcome a group of MƒÅori artists who were participating in the Perth International Arts Festival. The welcome, extended on behalf of the Noongar people, was intended to mirror the visitors' own traditions, while incorporating elements of Aboriginal culture.Walley recalled: MƒÅori performers were uncomfortable performing their cultural act without having been acknowledged or welcomed by the people of the land. > I asked the good spirits of my ancestors and the good spirits of the > ancestors of the land to watch over us and keep our guests safe while > they‚Äôre in our Country. And then I talked to the spirits of their ancestors, > saying that we‚Äôre looking after them here and we will send them back to > their Country. Arts administrator Rhoda Roberts says that the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust was instrumental in developing the welcome to country during the 1980s. Since 2008, a Welcome to Country has been incorporated into the ceremonial opening of the Parliament of Australia, an event which occurs after each federal election. The Welcome includes a speech as well as traditional music and dance. Given that Parliament sits in Canberra, traditionally part of Ngambri country, a Ngambri elder officiates. Welcomes and Acknowledgements have since been incorporated into openings of meetings and other events across Australia, by all levels of government, universities, community groups, arts other organisations. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (Shown here.) Significance Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were largely excluded from Australian history books and from the democratic process in Australia for the first two centuries of white settlement, since the colonisation of Australia from 1788. They are not included in the Australian flag or the Australian national anthem. Including recognition of Indigenous peoples in events, meetings and national symbols is one part of repairing the damage caused by exclusion from settler society. Incorporating Welcome or Acknowledgement protocols into official meetings and events \\"recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of land\\" and shows respect for Traditional Owners. Description Both Welcomes and Acknowledgements recognise the continuing connection of Aboriginal Traditional Owners to their Country, and offer appropriate respect as part of the process of reconciliation and healing. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (Shown here.) =Welcome to Country= The Victorian Government advised that Welcomes are advised for major public events, forums and functions in locations where Traditional Owners have been formally recognised. A Welcome to Country can only be undertaken by an Elder, formally recognised Traditional Owner. or custodian to welcome visitors to their traditional country. The format varies; it may include a welcome speech, a traditional dance, and/or smoking ceremony. =Acknowledgement of Country= If a local Elder is not available, or if the Traditional Owners have not been formally recognised for the area, an Acknowledgement of Country, also known as Acknowledgement of Traditional Owners, performed by the host of the event, is appropriate. If there is no formal recognition of Traditional Ownership, it is advised to limit recognition to an Acknowledgement of Traditional Owners generally, without making a reference to the name of any specific Traditional Owners The Victorian Government's wording for recognised Traditional Owners: 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (Shown here.) And for unknown Traditional Owners: The City of Adelaide's wording is (specifically tailored for the local Kaurna people): Other countries Similar acknowledgements, e.g. land acknowledgements, have become common at public events in Canada and have begun to be adopted by Native American groups in the United States.  Observance and criticism  Some jurisdictions, such as New South Wales, make a Welcome (or, failing that, Acknowledgement) mandatory at all government-run events. Although Welcomes to Country have become commonplace across the country, they have attracted criticism from some politicians, historians and commentators including Bess Price, Keith Windschuttle, Andrew Bolt and Bill Hassell. Critics consider such ceremonies to be a form of tokenism, and claim that they do not reflect any element of traditional Aboriginal culture. Then leader of the Federal Opposition, Tony Abbott called it \\"a genuflection to political correctness\\" and that it \\"lacks heart\\". Price, a Warlpiri woman and former parliamentarian, characterised Welcomes as \\"not particularly meaningful to traditional people\\". Windschuttle calls them \\"an invented tradition\\". Hassell says that \\"Although I loathe and detest welcomes to the country, I sit through them patiently when we have these ceremonies\\". The Victorian government overturned the previous government's observance protocols in 2011, and a municipal Council in NSW ceased mandating it in 2017. Critics such as Abbott and Windschuttle consider them \\"part and parcel of being politically correct\\". In popular culture  The Australian band Midnight Oil released a single in August 2020 entitled \\"Gadigal Land\\", whose lyrics include a play on the traditional Welcome to Country as a critical review of Aboriginal history. Starting with the line \\"Welcome to Gadigal land\\", it goes on to mention smallpox, poison and grog (alcohol), which were all brought to Australia by the colonisers. The song urges reconciliation.

It is the first modern building game to allow the player to work in full 3D environment. It is published in France by Focus, in the UK and Germany by Deep Silver and in North America by CDV. It was released in May 2006. City Life allows players to zoom in and see every little bit of detail. The placement method allows buildings to be placed at an angle, as also seen in Sierra Games' Caesar IV. More recently, the game has been criticized for lack of many detailed elements, such as weather, disasters, and more \\"in depth\\" user control. Summary City Life continues the very long tradition of city-building and construction and management games, that was originally started by Utopia from developer Don Daglow and Will Wright's SimCity series by allowing the player to customize their urban city's roads, buildings, finances, ordinances and much more. City Life utilizes a three dimensional game engine in displaying cities, and also includes the requirement to satisfy six different socioeconomic groups within the city, an essential part of gameplay. The six groups include the Elites, Suits, Radical Chics, Fringe, Blue collars and Have-Nots. =Classes= Diagram of the relationships between the classes in City Life. In game, the six classes are depicted in a circle. Clockwise from the top are Elites, Suits, Blue Collars, Have-Nots, Fringes, and Radical Chics. Each class can tolerate the two adjacent to it, but is hostile towards the three across the circle. Further, the income generated by businesses focusing on each class is indicated by its height on the circle, Have-Nots generating the least and Elites generating the most. Lastly, the left side of the circle favors education while the right side favors safety (e.g. police and fire department coverage). The higher classes are of course more demanding. When a city is founded, only Fringes, Have-Nots, and Blue Collars will settle there. The Suits must be attracted by having good conditions for the Blue Collars, the Radical Chics are attracted by good conditions for the Fringes, and the Elites are attracted by good conditions for both the Suits and the Radical Chics. Due to the literal class warfare, if classes that dislike each other live near each other, they will start riots and make complaints. Much of the gameplay focuses on arranging your city so that this will not occur. Every business will employ a specific mix of classes; the earlier, less profitable buildings may employ only one class, e.g. six fringe, but later buildings require a mix of several classes to reach their full potential. Thus, a successful city must manage a population of each of the classes. A city in City Life. As their name implies, the Elites are the most powerful and wealthiest segment of the population. However, they are also the most demanding of the six, requiring quality services in sectors like education, safety, leisure, and environment. Elites are usually attracted to a city by \\"evolving\\" from either the Radical Chic or Suit groups. Most of their employment will derive from jobs in the private industry (i.e. private clinics and private colleges,) as well as jobs in large financial institutions. They are, by far, the most lucrative socialculture of the six. The Radical Chics are ranked among the higher income groups and are as lucrative as the Suits. They are very close to the artistic and creative world and have liberal views and dispositions. Employment for Radical Chics derive from jobs in designing (i.e. clothing and interior spaces,) researching, and cosmetic surgery. Radical Chics get attracted to a city by \\"evolving\\" from Fringes. This group favors services in education and retail. The Suits are a wealthy community whom conduct business transactions within industries. Suits are attracted to a city by \\"evolving\\" from Blue Collars. They demand quality services in safety and healthcare among others. Their employment will derive from jobs in financial advising, auditing, accounting, and stock trading. The Fringes are artists who have low incomes (slightly lower than that of Blue Collars) and are usually fans of cultural activities. They also lean towards liberal views of the world. Fringes are naturally attracted to any city with available housing, though under certain circumstances, they will \\"evolve\\" from Have- Nots. They demand good retail services and adequate educational services. Employment for the Fringes derives primarily from clothing workshops, wood companies, and paranormal activities (i.e. wraith hunters and extraterrestrial landing sites.) The Blue Collars work in the industries of the city and have revenues close to that of the Fringes (they are slightly more lucrative.) They represent the typical suburban family with traditional values. Blue Collars will usually be attracted to a city with available housing, but under certain circumstances will \\"evolve\\" from Have-Nots. They demand good services for healthcare and decent services for safety. Employment for Blue Collars is usually found in industries, private investigating, fishing companies, and oil derricks/platforms. The Have-Not community is at the crossroads between the artistic and the industrial worlds. They are the lowest on the scale of power and wealth. Have-Nots do not demand any services at all. In fact, they are content with having nothing more than a house and a job. Unlike Fringes and Blue Collars, Have-Nots are not too easily attracted to a city. In order for them to appear, the player will usually have to create a district focusing primarily on Have-Not jobs and leisure activities. It is also possible to attract Have Nots by having Fringes and Blue Collars \\"devolve\\" into Have-Nots. This is achieved when Fringes and Blue Collars remain unemployed for a certain amount of time. =Economy= City Life has a simple economy. Each building has infrastructure costs which are paid by the city to the business, including fixed costs and costs which are related to the number of employees a building requires. Roads, bridges, parks and monuments also count as buildings in this way. Buildings also have indirect costs with regards the energy they consume and waste they produce. Buildings which represent businesses also generate income which is taxed and is paid back to the city. Therefore, the monthly budget for the city (i.e. for the player) is calculated by taking the taxed income and subtracting the infrastructure costs for each building. For example, the basic industrial building has $50 of fixed infrastructure costs and generates up to $100 in revenue tax per worker. When staffed with 3 workers the net profit for the city is thus $250 per month. However, profits from business are not guaranteed at a fixed rate. For example, building a vegan restaurant in a city with a low population of Radical Chics will result in less than maximum income. Similarly, a casino won't turn maximum profit until there are Elites. In this way, the game forces the player to partially develop the richer communities in order to make their larger businesses viable. Energy and waste in City Life are also considered a kind of income. Energy or waste management that the city provides for itself is cheaper than buying those services externally. Any surplus energy can be sold for profit, as can excess waste management. For example, a power station generates 5100 points of energy. If the city uses only 3100 energy, then the remaining 2000 energy will be sold and is counted as monthly profit. Incidentally this makes the power station one of the best initial industries for a city since it provides work for Blue Collar and profits are much larger than other industrial businesses. Expansions =World Edition= A City Life expansion pack, dubbed City Life: World Edition, was released on December 30, 2006 online and on January 15, 2007 in stores. World Edition features landmarks around the world, including the Eiffel Tower and the Sears Tower. Additional content includes: * Building Creation Tool * 100 new buildings, bringing the total number of buildings to 300. City Life Deluxe On December 30, 2006, registered game users received an email advertisement for City Life Deluxe. It is available for purchase and download from the City Life website, though the site does not detail updates to World Edition within the expansion, if any. =2008 Edition= On August 30, 2007, Monte Cristo and Focus announced an upcoming second expansion pack for City Life entitled City Life 2008 Edition, saying the expansion would include \\"60 more buildings, bringing the total to 360, including famous structures such as St Pauls Cathedral, Royal Opera etc... New scenarios, 10 new maps, and an updated version of the editor allow you to import satellite maps, as well as import from applications such as World Machine, or GeoControl.\\" The official release date for the expansion pack was November 10, 2007. On November 16, 2007, the release date was pushed back to November 23, 2007. The game was finally released effective on February 15, 2008. Also, Monte Cristo has confirmed, in 2008, that they would make a City Life game for Nintendo DS. =DS= On August 7, 2009, a DS version was released in Europe. Reception City Life 2008 received average reviews, with a Metacritic average score of 75. PC Gamer magazine in the UK said it was \\"no great shakes, but an awful lot better than SimCity Societies\\". IT Reviews said that \\"life in this particular city is rather humdrum, we're afraid, and owners of previous versions of the game will find new content rather thin on the pavement\\".

Using 2018 data (based on revised 2017 CAPMAS data projection), population of the two is 1,187,747 and 42,910 people per km2. The 3 kisms combined have 1,655,941 people with 46,764 people per km2. Transportation Shubra El Kheima is an important link point to many of other Governorates like the capital Cairo, Giza, Sharqyia, and Manofia. For instance it's a link to the Egyptian capital Cairo through many roads e.g. Cornish El-Nile road if someone wants to go to downtown, Ahmed Helmi street if someone wants to go to Ramses area and also another way to downtown, as well as Shubra El Kheima has the northern terminus of Line 2 of the Cairo Metro. Landmarks  = Mohamed Ali Palace = Shubra El Kheima hosts the Palace of Mohamed Ali Pasha, the founder of modern Egypt. He chose an isolated palace or an official residence away from the Citadel in the district called Shubra, the construction of the palace began in 1808 and it was completed in 1821. The Palace of Mohammad Ali or Shubra Palace is distinguished by its style of decoration that mixes between the Islamic style of decoration and the European one. Mohammed Ali's Palace is the first flourishing structures in Shubra. This palace was once involving about 13 building but the only remaining parts of it are the reception area, the fountain kios, the basin area and the garden that was provided with a collection of rare plants and some of them still exist and it is now a museum. The palace finally came under the authority of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in 1978. The most remarkable one is the drawing room which was used a dining room, a small garden was planted in each step of this scalar hill which was irrigated the waterwheel tower that was constructed to provide the gardens and the villa with fresh water.

In narrow sense it is used to denote the rank of a four-star general introduced on August 15, 2002 (formerly genera≈Ç armii - general of the army). It is currently the highest military rank of the Polish Army, with the rank of Marshal of Poland currently being unused. The symbols of the rank are the wƒô≈ºyk generalski (pronounced ), or \\"general's wavy line\\", and four stars, featured both on the rogatywka, sleeves of the uniform and above the breast pocket of a field uniform. Background In Polish military traditions the highest rank was always the rank of Marshal of Poland, with three General's grades below. However, the system differed significantly from other systems of rank insignia used in both armies of the Warsaw Pact and the NATO. Because of lack of the rank of four-star general, the Polish ranks were usually a grade higher than their name suggested. Thus the rank of Genera≈Ç brygady was an equivalent of Major General rather than Brigadier General as the name suggested. In 1954, during the integration of the Polish Army with the structures of the Warsaw Pact (and, more precisely, of the Red Army), a new rank of genera≈Ç armii (General of an Army) was introduced, as a direct copy of the Soviet rank of General of the Army (). However, after the death of Joseph Stalin and the end of Stalinism in Poland, the general officers rank structure returned to the pre-war pattern. In 1981 Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski (being at this time the 1st Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Prime Minister and the Minister of the National Defense) introduced again the rank of general of the army. As the only person to hold the newly introduced rank, he was thought of as an ersatz-Marshal, as he could not promote himself to the rank of Marshal of Poland after the death of Marian Spychalski. In 1995 the rank was yet again abolished and the only people to still hold it are Jaruzelski and Gen. Florian Siwicki, both died in the early 2010s. However, with Poland's entry into the structures of NATO a need arose to unify the Polish rank system with that of English-speaking countries (and more precisely, the US). Hence the rank of a Genera≈Ç was introduced. The rank of Marshal of Poland remains as the \\"wartime\\" rank, given to the chief of general staff in case of war or a successful military commander after a victorious campaign.

She performed blockade duty in the Hampton Roads-Virginia Capes area, and on the night of 10 June joined a flotilla under Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee in an expedition up the James River to assist Army troops. Returning to Newport News two days later, she resumed blockade duty until sent back up the James with seven other Union warships to threaten Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. In the wake of the Battle of Gettysburg, the movement was designed to divert Confederate strength from General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia which had invaded the North and imperiled Washington, D.C. The expedition caused the South to evacuate Fort Powhatan, leaving no defenses on the James below Chaffin's or Drewry's Bluffs, some from Richmond. The situation relaxed as the Confederate Army retreated across the Potomac River, and the Union warships dropped down river to Hampton Roads. On the morning of 23 July, Lehigh, towed by , got underway north and arrived New York City two days later for repairs. In August 1863, commanded by Commander Andrew Bryson, she headed south and joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Charleston, South Carolina. The monitor took part in the attacks on Fort Sumter of 1 and 2 September, being struck several times; engaged Sullivan's Island 7 September; Fort Moultrie 8 September, receiving 29 hits; covered a landing party attacking Fort Sumter 9 September; and from 27 October to 20 November engaged Fort Sumter almost daily, running aground 16 November off Sullivan's Island under heavy enemy fire.

In March 1865, Lehigh rejoined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and served in the James River through the end of the Civil War. She decommissioned at League Island Navy Yard on 9 June 1865. Laid up and under repairs at League Island for a decade, Lehigh was recommissioned on 15 December 1875, with Commander George A.

(2016) local government area, 260,240, just north of Abuja, capital of the Suleja Emirate. It is sometimes confused with the nearby city of Abuja, due to its proximity, and the fact that it was originally called Abuja before the Nigerian government adopted the name from the then Emir Sulayman Barau for its new federal capital in 1976. It was established in the early 19th century by Mohammed Makau, the last Hausa emir of Zaria and his followers who were fleeing the Fulani jihadists engaged in the conquest of northern Nigeria. Zaria, or Zazzau, was one of the Hausa city/states of Northern Nigeria which were being conquered by the Fulani jihadists under their charismatic Sheik, Usman bin Fodio. Apart from its closeness to the Nigerian federal capital, it is also recognised as a centre of excellence for traditional West African pottery, namely the world-famous Ladi Kwali Pottery Centre, established by Michael Cardew in 1950. The leading exponent of this school of pottery was Dr. Ladi Kwali, who received worldwide acclaim for her works, the originals of which are on display worldwide. Economy Discoveries of ancient sculptures of the Nok culture, both at Suleja town and in the Makabolo River bed, have helped prove the influence of Nok on the Yoruba art of Ife. Today Suleja is well known as an exporter of Gbari pottery. Cotton weaving and dyeing, with locally grown indigo, and mat making are traditional activities, but farming remains the chief occupation. Local trade is primarily in agricultural products. In addition to the Pottery Centre, a government secondary school and a hospital are located in the town. The Dorben Polytechnic has a campus in Suleja. History The emirate's wooded savanna area of about originally included four small Koro chiefdoms that paid tribute to the Hausa kingdom of Zazzau. After warriors of the Fulani jihad (struggle/War) captured Zaria (Zazzau's capital, north-northeast) about 1804, Muhamman Makau, sarkin (\\"king of\\") Zazzau, led many of the Hausa nobility to the Koro town of Zuba ( south). Abu Ja (Jatau), his brother and successor as sarkin Zazzau, founded Abuja town in 1828, began construction of its wall a year later, and proclaimed himself the first Sarkin Abuja. Withstanding Zaria attacks, the Abuja emirate remained an independent Hausa refuge. Trade with the Fulani emirates of Bida (to the west) and Zaria began in Emir Abu Kwaka's reign (1851‚Äì77), but, when Abuja's leaders disrupted the trade route between Lokoja ( south-southeast) and Zaria in 1902, the British occupied the town. Alluvial tin mining began in Emir Musa Angulu's reign (1917‚Äì44). In 2011, Suleja was hit by several bomb assaults. Ten people were killed on March 3rd. 10 feared dead in Suleja bomb blast, Vanguard, visited April 16, 2011 On April 7th, another bomb killed 25 people.Bomb Explosion At INEC Office In Suleja, THEWILL, visited April 16, 2011 See also *Boko Haram *Mayanka Falls References Category:Populated places in Niger State Category:Local Government Areas in Niger State ","title":"Suleja"},{"id":"3897820","text":"Signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (February 9, 1918) by 1.

He was Premier of the country throughout most of World War I. Biography Born in Lovech, Radoslavov studied law at Heidelberghttp://www.minfin.bg/en/page/105 and became a supporter of Germany from then on. He became a political figure in 1884 when he was appointed Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Petko Karavelov, also holding the position under Archbishop Kliment Turnovski. He succeeded Karavelov as Prime Minister in 1886 and being aged 32 years, was the youngest person to have ever been Prime Minister of Bulgaria. Additionally he was the Minister of Finance. His brief reign was marked by corruption and ultimately led to a split in the Liberal Party, with a Radoslav Liberal Party formed in 1887 as a grouping for right-wing liberals. Radoslavov was noted for his strong support for friendship with Austria-Hungary.S.G. Evans, A Short History of Bulgaria, London, Lawrence and Wishart, 1960, p. 152 He returned to government in 1899 as Minister for Internal Affairs in the government of Todor Ivanchov, although after this he remained out of office until 1913 when he returned as Prime Minister. His anti-Russian rhetoric impressed Ferdinand who worked closely with Radoslavov in shaping foreign policy. He secured a large loan from Germany and Austria-Hungary in July 1914 but also managed to delay Bulgarian entry into the War. His popularity fell after Bulgaria officially entered the War, however, with money and resources now directed fully to the war effort. As Prime Minister he oversaw the liberation of Southern Dobruja and the occupation of Northern Dobruja in 1916 with the aid of German General August von Mackensen, although the move lost him some support from the German government as they wanted some of the territory for themselves.S.G. Evans, A Short History of Bulgaria, London, Lawrence and Wishart, 1960, p. 156 His government remained in office until June 1918, when the more moderate Aleksandar Malinov was recalled in the hope of brokering a favourable peace deal, with Radoslavov blamed for the failure of Bulgaria to gain full control of Northern Dobruja in the Treaty of Bucharest (the southern part of Northern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria, while the northern part of the region was placed under joint Bulgarian, Turkish, German and Austrian-Hungarian administration). By this point the Radoslavov government had become a by-word for corruption and subservience to Germany.S.G. Evans, A Short History of Bulgaria, London, Lawrence and Wishart, 1960, p. 156 Radoslavov fled Bulgaria after the war, going into exile in Germany. In 1922 the regime of Aleksandar Stamboliyski sentenced him to death in absentia for his part in the defeat. He was pardoned in 1929, the same year in which he died whilst still in exilehttp://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/radoslavov.htm in Berlin, Weimar Republic, on 21 October.

Typhoon Nina originated from an area of convection near the Marshall Islands in mid- November 1987\\\\. It gradually became better organized, and on November 19, was first classified as a tropical cyclone. Moving west-northwest, Nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening. Late on November 20, Nina passed through the Chuuk Lagoon. After a brief pause in intensification, Nina intensified into a typhoon on November 22\\\\. Two days later, the typhoon intensified suddenly, before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of . During the afternoon of November 25, Nina moved ashore in southern Luzon at the same intensity. It gradually weakened over land, before entering the South China Sea and turning to the north. By November 30, Nina dissipated. Across the Chuuk Lagoon, four people were killed and damage ranged from $30‚Äì$40 million (1987 USD). In the capital of Weno, 85% of dwellings and 50% of government buildings were damaged. Throughout the atoll, at least 1,000 people were rendered homeless, approximately 1,000 houses were damaged, and 39 injuries were reported. While crossing the Philippines, Nina brought extensive damage to the northern portion of the island group. The town of Matnog sustained the worst damage from the typhoon, where 287 people died. Sixty-one lives were lost in the nearby city of Verla, where 98% of all structures were either damaged or destroyed. Four hundred people died, 80% of all crops were destroyed, and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province. Nearby, in the Albay province, 73 people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifths of all schools and half of all public infrastructure were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Boac, 80% of homes lost their roofs. In Bacacay, 18 of the village's 200 homes were destroyed. However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon. Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000 people sought shelter, approximately 90,000 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000 homeless. Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5 million and 808 people perished. Meteorological history An area of convection developed within near the Marshall Islands in mid-November. Initially, convection waxed and waned, but on November 17, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system. At this time, the system developed deep convection as well as good outflow. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 0100 UTC on November 19 due to a significant increase in organization. Five hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west-northwest, the cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC at midday. On the evening of November 19, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, prompting JTWC to name the system as Nina, shortly after developing banding features. Initially forecast by the JTWC to move slowly, instead, Nina accelerated while gradually intensifying. At 1600 UTC on November 20, Tropical Storm Nina passed south of Weno Island in the Chuuk Lagoon. Two hours later, the JMA upgraded Nina to a severe tropical storm. After moving away from the island on the morning of November 21, the JTWC upgraded Nina to a typhoon at 1200 UTC, with the JMA following suit early on November 22. Shortly thereafter, Nina made its closest approach to Ulithi, passing to the north. At 1600 UTC, Nina tracked about north of Yap. Nina at peak intensity while approaching landfall in the Philippines. Typhoon Nina accelerated slightly as it traversed the open waters of the Philippine Sea. The storm continued to slowly deepen, though early on November 23, the system leveled off in intensity. That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Sisang, upon entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility. However, midday on November 24, Nina entered a phase of explosive intensification , at a rate of an hour. Despite this, the JMA only increased the intensity slightly to . After developing a well-defined eye, the JTWC reported that Nina attained its peak intensity of , making it a low-end Category 5 system on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. At 1500 UTC on November 25, Nina moved ashore along the southern tip of Luzon at its peak intensity. Despite interacting with land, little change in strength occurred until 0000 UTC on November 26, at that time, the system began to weaken. After traversing Luzon and Mindoro, the JTWC reduced the wind speed of the typhoon to . Although no eye was visible on satellite imagery, radar imagery indicated that an eye was present, but cloud-filed; henceforth, the JTWC increased the intensity of Nina to , equivalent to a weak Category 3 hurricane. According to the JMA, however, Nina never re-intensified. By 0000 UTC on November 27, the low and mid level circulations began to decouple, deeply thwarting many JTWC forecasters. During this time, the cyclone posed a serious threat to Southern China and Hong Kong; but instead, Nina veered northward while gradually weakening; by midday on November 27, the JMA had reduced the intensity of Nina to . Early on November 28, an eye once again became visible on satellite imagery. However, no re-intensification occurred. By the afternoon, increased wind shear took toll on the cyclone, causing Nina to become less organized due to deep convection being sheared off to the east-northeast. Thus, the JTWC expected Nina to move into the Luzon Straits and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After meandering within the South China Sea, Nina turned south, before dissipating on November 29; though, JMA continued to monitor its remnants until 0000 UTC on November 30. Preparation and impact =Federated States of Micronesia= While passing near Truk, which has a population of 42,000, Typhoon Nina inflicted heavy crop damage on the area. In the capital of Weno, 85% of homes and 50% of government buildings were damaged. There, communication lines were downed and hundreds of people were evacuated. Throughout the atoll, four lives were lost, including a woman and a 14-year-old boy killed by a falling breadfruit tree and an 11-year-old girl died after her leg was struck by a piece of flying metal. One person was reported missing. Over 1,000 people were rendered homeless while roughly 1,000 homes were damaged. Damaged from the storm ranged from $30‚Äì40 million (1987 USD) and 39 were wounded. =Philippines= Prior to landfall, around 10 provinces, including most of Luzon, was placed under a typhoon alert. However, many fisherman ignored the alerts and refused to flee to higher ground. Furthermore, Philippine Air Lines cancelled 21 domestic flights and three international flights. Numerous other flights were delayed. Local authorities also suspended school classes. Typhoon Nina brought widespread damage to much of the northern Philippines. It was the strongest system to strike the archipelago since Typhoon Irma in 1981. The capital city of Manila was spared the worst of Nina. There, only minor damage and power outages were reported, though 800 were evacuated to shelters due to flooding and the city's airport closed. Two men were crushed to death in Lucena City. The worst effects of the storm were felt in Matnog, where 287 people drowned due to storm surge. In nearby Verla, 61 fatalities occurred, where 98% of the city's buildings were damaged or destroyed and its supply of drinking water was cut off. Throughout the Sorsogon province, 80% of all crops were destroyed and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed. Province-wide, 400 people died. In the Albay province, 73 people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces combined, 80% of all schools and 50% of all public buildings were demolished. Elsewhere, seven casualties occurred in the Laguna province, while one person perished each in San Pablo, Batangas, Marinduque and Mindoro Oriental. Thirty-two people were killed in the Camarines Sur province and 23 other lives were lost in Camarines Norte. Five others were killed in the Masbate province, and one died in Marinduque. In Boac, the capital of Marinduque, 80% of all dwellings lost their roofs and damage was severe to churches, schools and city buildings. In Bacacay, situated to the southeast of Legaspi, all but 15 of the town's 200 dwellings were leveled. Although there were no deaths, Samar Island also suffered severe damage. Offshore, five fisherman perished and a tugboat and cargo ship were rendered missing due to rough seas. Nina also brought widespread power outages to most of Luzon; consequently, trading on the nation's two biggest stock exchange was suspended for November 26. Overall, around 114,000 persons were evacuated to shelters, 153,339 were listed homeless, and 1,075 were wounded. A total of 90,173 homes were demolished due to Nina while an additional 109,633 were partially destroyed. Nationwide, 808 people were killed. In all, damage from the storm totaled $54.5 million (1987 USD), $7.9 million of which occurred along the Bicol Region. = China = Although Nina was rapidly weakening over the South China Sea, the storm brought of rain to Hong Kong, prompting a tropical cyclone signal for nearby Macau. Aftermath Due to the damage wrought by Nina, President Corazon Aquino declared four Luzon provinces a disaster area. Initially, only 11 provinces were declared a state of emergency, but by November 29, this total increased to 17. United States Ambassador Nicholas Platt released $25,000 in emergency aid and sent officials to help with relief efforts. The American Red Cross also provided $24,000 worth of aid to post- storm victims. The Roman Catholic Church also provided $160,000 worth of food to the nation. Additionally, Social Welfare and Development Secretary Mita Pardo de Tavera donated $50,000 for emergency disaster relief, though many locals complained that this aid was too little and too late. Around of rice was donated for use in eight provinces, and on December 1, an additional of aid was airlifted to the region. Belgium also launched a four-month program to help 380,000 post-storm victims. Most flights in and out of Manila had returned to a normal schedule by November 28. In all, nine countries and several foreign Red Cross organizations responded by providing aid, totaling roughly $700,000 worth of value, mostly from Japan. PAGASA later retired the name Sisang on the list of tropical cyclones in the country; it was replaced by Sendang.

They are members of the . The club is affiliated to the Berks & Bucks Football Association. History The club was formed in 1957 after the demise of Ivinghoe & Pitstone F.C. due to financial difficulties and started playing at Pitstone Recreation Ground. The club started in the West Herts League and in their inaugural season won the West Herts Challenge Cup. In the early 1960s, the club then joined the Aylesbury & District League, before returning to the West Herts League in 1966. The club moved leagues again in 1970 to join the Dunstable Alliance League, not before enjoying some previous cup success with winning the Marsworth Cup twice and both the Apsley Junior and Senior Cups. In the 1976‚Äì77 Campaign the club achieved a treble of Trophy's by winning the Premier Division, Premier Division Cup and the Reading Junior Cup. The next season with improved facilities at the Recreation Ground the club was accepted into the South Midlands League and in doing so gained Intermediate status with the Berks & Bucks F.A. The club then spent the next Eleven season in Division One, earning promotion to the Premier Division under the guidance of manager Ian Magill in the 1987‚Äì88 season. The club also lifted the Division One Cup and South Midlands League Challenge Trophy. Two seasons later in the 1989‚Äì90 season saw the club gain more Silverware by winning the Premier Division. They then spent three more seasons in the top flight before having to step down to the newly formed Senior Division as their ground did not have floodlights. The club finished bottom of the Senior Division twice and were then relegated to Division One at the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season. At the start of the 1997/98 season with the merger of the South Midlands League and Spartan League, the club became founder members of Spartan South Midlands League Division 1 North. That season also saw the return of manager Ian Magill who guided them to promotion again to the Senior Division(which was then subsequently renamed Division One), in the 2000‚Äì01 season, as Champions. In addition for that season the club enjoyed its first County Cup success by beating Hellenic Football League side Finchampstead 2‚Äì0 in the Berks & Bucks Intermediate Cup Final. Ian Magill then stood down in the 2002‚Äì03 season and was replaced by Sean Downey. It proved a successful change as the club won Division One title by a ten-point margin, and scoring over a hundred goals in the process. However the club was not able to gain promotion as the club's facilities did not fulfill the league's requirements. Two seasons later, the club was then relegated to Division Two as a result of its ground not meeting the necessary requirements again. The club has since the 2004‚Äì05 season remained in Division Two of the Spartan South Midlands League. On Saturday 23 February 2013 the First team reached the Final of the Berks & Bucks Intermediate Cup by defeating Letcombe FC 2‚Äì1. Previous rounds had seen Pitstone win against Loughton Manor, Aylesbury Dynamoes, Olney Town, Burnham Reserves, and Frilsham and Yattendon. The Final was held at Chesham Utd FC on the evening of 16th April 2013. Pitstone and Ivinghoe FC won the game 2-1 against Aston Clinton FC. As of the 2019-20 Season, Pitstone & Ivinghoe FC sat in second place of Spartan South Midlands Division Two before the season was suspended in March.

Funds from the ticket and concession sales for the game typically go to charity, the senior class, or to a dance. The games are an annual tradition at many high schools and universities. The term originates from the powder puff, the soft material used for the application of cosmetic face powder. The games usually occur before homecoming. History It is not clear when the first powderpuff football game was played, although there is photographic evidence of it being played as early as 1931 at Western State College of Colorado (now Western State Colorado University) in Gunnison, Colorado.One of the first well-documented powderpuff football games was played on October 20, 1945, at Eastern State Teachers College, in Madison, South Dakota. Eastern had cancelled many campus activities for the duration of Word War II. Among these were the annual homecoming celebration and intercollegiate sports, including football With the signing of the peace treaty with Japan on September 2, 1945, and the war‚Äôs official end, Homecoming was again on the schedule at Eastern. The traditional football game seemed out of the question, however, due to the wartime military draft. Just three men had enrolled for the fall term that year. \\"A bunch of us were sitting around after gym class and we thought, if we‚Äôre going to have Homecoming, we've got to have a football game,\\" said Susie Lowry, who was a freshman at Eastern in 1945. \\"We decided we should have a game of our own.\\"Robert C. Nelles, a freshman at Eastern that year, was on the Homecoming committee. The very idea of women playing football \\"was enough to curl your teeth\\", he wrote in an account of the game for the History of Lake County, but the committee nonetheless gave its approval for a game with all women players. There were two groups of Eastern coeds at the time: those who lived at their homes in Madison while attending classes on campus, and those from surrounding small towns who lived in the dorm. The 23 girls who wanted to play football divided into two teams, informally known as the Townies and Dormies. On game day, the teams were designated Blue and Gold teams, respectively, which were Eastern‚Äôs school colors.Leota Van Ornum, Eastern's physical education teacher, served as coach for both teams. There was a high school on Eastern‚Äôs campus where students training to be teachers did their practice teaching. Robert Ormseth, who coached that school's football team, served as her assistant.\\"A fairly large group of spectators showed great interest and enthusiasm during the game,\\" according to The Eastern, the campus newspaper. Friends and family and were surely well represented, because the twenty-three players constituted almost half of Eastern‚Äôs enrollment of fifty-three that term. Robert Nelles and Paul Tommeraasen, two of the three male students, were pressed into service as game officials. ‚ÄúWe tried to be almost real, with huddles and all that,\\" said Lowry. \\"There was a lot of clowning around. A few of us fell down, just to make it look good, but it wasn‚Äôt really rough or anything.\\" The neophyte gridders proved more adept at defense than offense, with each team holding the other scoreless until the game's final minute. Doris Treloar of the Gold team finally broke through and scored a touchdown, which was immediately answered by Nancy Baughman of the Blue. Professor A.E. Swan, the librarian serving as the referee, considered that an opportune moment to end the contest on an amiable note.In its story about the game, the Madison Daily Leader dubbed the two teams \\"The Powderpuff and Rouge Elevens The name was suggested because the women chose to poke fun at themselves by staying on the field at halftime and putting on fresh makeup before the amused spectators.Lyman Hall and Sheehan High School compete in Annual Samaha Bowl 2015 The first powderpuff football game of the modern era was held in 1972, in Wallingford, Connecticut. Judy Samaha, a physical education teacher and coach for Mark T. Sheehan High School at the time, began this sport to incorporate more girls into athletic activities. She contacted Lyman Hall High School, Sheehan's rival, to set up a small but fierce game between the schools. Since then, powderpuff football has spread over the nation, from neighboring towns in Connecticut to schools in California, Texas, and Florida. The annual Samaha bowl game still takes place the Wednesday before Thanksgiving as the longest running powderpuff game in the country. The tradition was adopted in Massachusetts at schools such as Pope John XXIII High School where underclass girls faced upperclass girls. The tradition still lives with schools like Mystic Valley Regional Charter School playing once a year the day before Thanksgiving Day, or St. David's School in Raleigh, NC, which attracts a stadium full of spectators for a high-energy game under the lights. Team Blonde at the 2011 Blondes vs. Brunettes powder puff football game in Washington, D.C.Many schools that participate in powderpuff games have created their own traditions. Some examples of traditions that make the event more entertaining for students are the creation of team uniform T-shirts for each of the classes, pre-game pep talks to get everyone \\"pumped\\", and special half-time performances from the class's male members, sometimes with them dressing up as cheerleaders.  Blondes vs. brunettes charity football  Blondes vs. Brunettes is a powderpuff football game played in cities across the United States.Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Fundraiser Proceeds from the event are donated to the Alzheimer's Association. The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative Joseph Hugh Allen, died of Alzheimer's disease in 2008. Looking for a way to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powderpuff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan. In the fall of 2005, the first blonde vs. brunette powder puff football game was played at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. and raised $10,000. Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington, D.C area before settling in at George Washington University‚Äôs Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009. The game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in The Washington Post and local TV stations and has raised over $500,000 in the national capital area alone. Blondes vs. Brunettes Charity Football is currently played in 16 cities in the United States. Abbott plans to continue the expansion to more cities and eventually establish a \\"Blondes vs. Brunettes Super Bowl.\\"The Washington Post. \\"Athletes First, Stylistas Second\\".

Controversy  = Gender Roles = Despite widespread popularity of powderpuff games, they have faced backlash for enforcing gender stereotypes. Teachers and parents alike have criticized the games for \\"demeaning women's athletic ability\\", citing how the name implies that girls are fragile and only fit to play flag football. There is also the argument that girls should feel like they are able to play football whenever they want, and having to have a special spectacle just for female students to participate in a male-dominated sport is a mockery of the abilities of female athletes. = Violence = Powderpuff games have also come under fire for encouraging violence between peers, especially at some schools where junior girls are subject to hazing by the senior class. In 2003, two Chicago area high-schools participated in hazing that led to five girls being hospitalized. School officials noted that the game was not an official, school-sanctioned activity and the school did not promote, plan, or even know about the event.

In their second season they won the 3rd Division. However, the team then folded, after which the club provided only boys' football until the Under 16's of 1979‚Äì80 also entered the Wycombe & District League. The club then won promotion in successive seasons, gaining promotion to the Ercol Senior League. During this period they also won the Berks & Bucks Junior Cup. At around the same time as entering the Ercol Senior League the club moved to 'Windsors', the former home of the defunct Hellenic League club Princes Risborough Town. Within several years, the club had managed to improve the ground by building a clubhouse/bar and extended the covered standing area. In 1989 Risborough accepted an invitation to join the South Midlands League and were placed in Division One. In the first two seasons the club struggled, finishing second from bottom and had to apply for re-election. However, at the end of season 1992‚Äì93, the club gained promotion to the Senior Division under the management of Frank Carter. At the start of the 1997‚Äì98 season, with the merger of the Souith Midlands league and the London Spartan League, the club became founder members of the Spartan South Midlands League Senior Division. The club remained in the Senior Division, which was later renamed Division One, until the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, when they finished bottom and were relegated to Division Two. In 2003‚Äì04, former Brackley Town and Abingdon Town manager Bob Rayner returned to the club from Thame United after chairman Richard Woodward persuaded him to return to the club he had last managed during the mid 1990s. Under his guidance the club steadily rebuilt, using players from the successful Rangers junior ranks. They finished runners-up in Division Two in the 2011‚Äì12 season.

Their top scorer during the 2014‚Äì15 season was Martin Griggs with 29 league goals, 35 goals in all competitions. The 2015‚Äì16 season was a busy season for Risborough Rangers. They competed in the FA Cup for the first time in their history winning 3‚Äì0 at Ampthill Town before going out 3‚Äì0 to Southern League side Aylesbury FC at 'Windsors' in front of a crowd of 450. In the FA Vase Rangers travelled to United Counties League side Irchester Utd, winning 4‚Äì0, before losing away to Cricklewood Wanderers 1‚Äì0 in the next round. Former Thame United, Chalfont St. Peter FC and Risborough Rangers player Jamie Rayner was appointed as joint first team manager alongside Bob Rayner at the start of the season, following a spell as joint assistant manager alongside long serving Nick Young. On a managerial level, Jamie had previously worked as Risborough Rangers Reserve team manager, where he guided them to promotion in his first season, only losing one league game. Rangers finished 7th in SSML Division One with top scorer Martin Griggs topping the division's goal-scoring chart with 35 goals from 33 matches. Risborough finished the season winning the Berks & Bucks FA Intermediate Cup beating Olney Town 2‚Äì1 AET in the final at Newport Pagnell Town. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season Bob Rayner retired from football management having managed Rangers for 15 seasons in total, handing over the reins to son Jamie and his assistant Nick Young. Jamie Rayner's first season in sole charge, the 2016-17 season, saw Rangers finish in sixth place in the Spartan South Midland League Division 1, ensuring qualification for the following years FA Cup Competition. They went out in the first round of the FA Vase to Broadfields United however. Their defence of Berks & Bucks Intermediate Cup ended in the semi-final against Woodley United on penalties following a 1-1 draw. Their top scorer for the season was Lamar Mason-Williams with thirty goals. At the end of the 2017-2018 season Rangers finished eighth in the table. Again they failed to progress in the FA Vase. In the FA Cup they went out following a penalty shoot-out after a replay with higher division opponents Cockfosters. Rangers reached the final of the Spartan South Midland League Challenge Trophy beating four teams from the division above them en route, before losing in the final to Broadfields United. Their top scorer for the season was Martin Griggs with 38 goals. In October 2018 then current manager Jamie Rayner decided to step down from his position because of work commitments. The Club advertised the position and after a healthy response, the Board appointed the former Aylesbury United, Aylesbury FC, Hemel Hempstead, Arlesey Town & Leighton Town boss Mark Eaton as their new manager. A remarkable turnaround in results ended with a 7th-place finish in the League after being 2nd from bottom when Eaton took charge. There was more success for Rangers with a 2-0 win over London Lions in the Spartan South Midlands Division One Cup Final, goals from Sam Pekun and Ben Cullen sealed the win at Leverstock Green's Pancake Lane. Because of the ongoing re-construction of the non-league system the club made a lateral movement to the Hellenic League Division One East from the Spartan for the start of the 2019/20 season. The 2019/20 season saw Rangers unbeaten and top the league by 12 points with a game in hand over 2nd place Abingdon United after playing 23 games out of the full 32. The COVID pandemic put an end to any hopes of promotion to step 5 for the first time in the clubs history however as the season was officially voided. Ground Risborough Rangers play their home games at the B.E.P Stadium, Horsenden Lane, Horsenden, Princes Risborough HP27 9NE. Windsor Playing Fields is usually referred to locally as 'Windsors'. The ground was once the home of the now defunct Princes Risborough Town FC who were founder members of the Hellenic Football League. After a long fund raising campaign the club finally installed floodlights at 'Winsors' in 2012 in order to take their promotion to Division One. The ground has covered seating and covered standing facilities. As from Saturday 20 July 2019, Windsors was rebranded \\"The B.E.P Stadium\\" under a new Club sponsorship deal with a local company, B.E.P Contracting Ltd. Structure The club is an FA Charter Standard Community Club, running two senior men's teams; First and Reserves, plus two youth teams at under 18 level. There is also a large thriving Junior Section fielding teams from under sevens up to sixteens for boys and girls. There are also two Pan Disability teams and a Walking Football Section for women and men aged over 50. After finishing under sixteen football, players are then invited to play under the wing of the Senior Section at under 18 level and from there the best players are encouraged to play in the Reserve Team who compete in the Hellenic League Div Two, and hopefully progress into the First Team.

His family moved to Kentucky from Virginia when he was very young. He became a member of the Kentucky militia, serving throughout his political career. He received a citation from the state legislature in recognition of his service at the Battle of New Orleans. After spending a decade in the state legislature, Slaughter was elected the fourth Lieutenant Governor, serving under Charles Scott. With the War of 1812 looming at the end of his tenure, Slaughter ran for governor against Isaac Shelby, the state's first governor and a noted military leader. Shelby beat Slaughter soundly. Four years later, Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor, serving under George Madison. Madison died a short time into his term, whereupon Slaughter became acting governor. He sought to be sworn in as governor, but public sentiment turned against him when he replaced Shelby's son-in-law with John Pope as Secretary of State. Pope was an unpopular figure in Kentucky and, after his appointment, some in the General Assembly began to call for a special election to replace Slaughter. The measure did not pass, but Slaughter was never able to shed the title of \\"acting governor.\\" Following his term as governor, Slaughter became a Baptist lay minister and served on the first board of trustees of Georgetown College. He died September 19, 1830 and was buried in his family's cemetery. Early life Gabriel Slaughter was born in Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia on December 12, 1767, the son of Robert and Susannah (Harrison) Slaughter.Harrison, p. 825 He was educated in the county's public schools and worked as a farmer. In 1786, Slaughter married a cousin, Sarah Slaughter, and the couple had two daughtersMary Buckner Slaughter and Susan Harrison Slaughter.Powell, p. 24Dorman, p. 339 Slaughter's father visited Kentucky as early as 1776, and moved to Mercer County permanently in 1789.Dorman, p. 338 In September 1791, Gabriel Slaughter sold his land in Virginia, and he and his family followed his father to Kentucky. He became known for his generosity, and his large mansion on the turnpike to Lexington was nicknamed \\"Wayfarer's Rest\\" because of the vast number of travelers that he allowed to stay there.Smith, p. 171 Among his guests was future lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee.Hopkins, p. 22 Soon after his arrival in Kentucky, however, his wife Sarah died, leaving Slaughter to care for his two daughters alone. In 1795, Slaughter was appointed justice of the peace in Mercer County by Governor Isaac Shelby. The same year, he was also named a tax commissioner for a district of Mercer County.Dorman, pp. 338-339 On a return trip to Virginia in 1797, Slaughter married his second wife, Sara Hord. The couple returned to Slaughter's home in Mercer County, where they had three children: John Hord Slaughter, Frances Ann Hord Slaughter, and Felix Grundy Slaughter. Service in the Kentucky General Assembly Slaughter's political career began in earnest with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County. He was named to the Committee on Enrollments, and probably served as chair, since he delivered the committee's reports to the Assembly. It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798, or whether he was defeated in that year's canvass. Whatever the case, he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy. He was re-elected to the state House in 1799. In addition to the Committee on Enrollments, he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported on the state of the Auditor's, Treasurer's, and Registrar's offices. Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a committee of the whole on November 25, 1799.Dorman, p. 340 Slaughter was re-elected to the state House in 1800, and from 1801 to 1808 he served in the Kentucky Senate. In 1801, he was chosen as one of three commissioners from Mercer County charged with selling stock shares in the Kentucky River Company, which was chartered to clear obstructions in the Kentucky River from its mouth to the mouth of its south fork. In 1804, he was a candidate for President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate following the death of the Senate's presiding officer, Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell. Ultimately, however, Thomas Posey proved the more popular choice. From 1807 to 1808, he served as chair of the Senate Committee of Propositions and Grievances.Dorman, 340-341 Slaughter was elected lieutenant governor in 1808. In a four-man race, he received more than three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent.Dorman, p. 341 His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished. Although the exact date is unknown, it is likely that the death of Slaughter's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor. On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) Rodes, a widow from Scott County. Prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution from succeeding himself as lieutenant governor, Slaughter ran for governor of Kentucky in 1812. The impending war with England, however, drew military hero and former governor Isaac Shelby into the race.Harrison, p. 826 Despite Shelby's immense popularity, Slaughter refused to withdraw from the race and was soundly beaten by more than a two-to-one margin. Following his defeat, Slaughter took a two-year hiatus from public life, and engaged in farming at his estate in Mercer County. Service in the state militia Slaughter had been commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Regiment of the Kentucky militia on December 24, 1803. He was promoted to the rank of major in 1802 and colonel in 1803. In 1814, he answered Governor Shelby's call for volunteers to serve in the army of the Southwest under General Andrew Jackson.Smith, p. 172 When the Quartermaster general did not deliver promised supplies to Slaughter's regiment, private funds had to be used to purchase boats for their travel down the Mississippi River. They also ran short of weapons. Upon their arrival at New Orleans on January 4, 1815, General Jackson noted in his official report that \\"Not one man in ten was well armed, and only one man in three had any arms at all.\\" The citizens of New Orleans provided enough firearms to equip the rest of Slaughter's men and another Kentucky battalion. Despite being vastly outnumbered, Jackson's forces were victorious. Units from Kentucky and Tennessee, including Slaughter's regiment, bore the brunt of the British attack.Dorman, pp. 342-343 Slaughter was later recognized by the state legislature for his service.NGA Bio Following their service together, Jackson asked Slaughter to preside over a court martial. When the verdict was not satisfactory to Jackson, he ordered Slaughter to reconsider and reverse the decision. Slaughter declined, replying \\"I know my duty, and have performed it.\\" This decision was respected by Jackson, and apparently did no harm to the mutual respect between him and Slaughter. Ascension to the governorship In 1816, Slaughter was again elected to the post of lieutenant governor over Richard Hickman and James Garrard.Dorman, p. 343 George Madison was elected governor without opposition. Madison died October 14, 1816, and Slaughter ascended to the governorship. This was the first time a sitting governor had died in office in Kentucky, and some questioned the legality of Slaughter's status in the position. Following Governor Madison's death, Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd offered to step down if Slaughter preferred to appoint someone else to the post. The letter was not an explicit resignation, as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with Slaughter should the governor choose to retain him.Dorman, p. 344 Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope, however, apparently as a political favor. This move proved disastrous for Slaughter's political career. Todd was very popular by virtue of being the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby. By contrast, Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812. The move was panned in the state's newspapers, and by prominent citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead. Yet Slaughter followed up with another unpopular decision, appointing Martin D. Hardin, a member of the hated Federalist Party, to fill the Senate seat of William T. Barry. Despite this, the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816. However, the administration candidate for a full senatorial term, John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly, which opted for John J. Crittenden.Dorman, pp. 345-346 On January 27, 1817, a faction in the Kentucky House of Representatives led by Joseph Cabell Breckinridge proposed a bill calling for the election of \\"a governor to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of\\" Governor Madison.Hopkins, p. 23 The measure failed, but the legislative elections of 1817 showed a popular mandate for a special gubernatorial election. The Kentucky House passed a bill calling for such elections by a vote of 56-30, but the measure died in the state senate. Nevertheless, Slaughter was never officially given the title of governor and was referred to as \\"lieutenant governor\\" or \\"acting governor\\" throughout his administration. The General Assembly censured both Slaughter and Pope for failing to require the proper security and oath of office for the state treasurer. Slaughter's unpopularity led to the demise of many of his proposals, regardless of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected. Slaughter's governorship was further complicated by the financial panic of 1819, and he spent the majority of his term working to stabilize that state's economy. Politicians of the day generally divided into those who favored measures favorable to debtors - called the \\"relief\\" position or party - and those who insisted that creditors be paid in a timely manner - called the \\"anti-relief\\" position or party. On December 16, 1819, the General Assembly passed a law requiring a six-month moratorium on the collection of debts.Rothbard, p. 76 Slaughter, an anti-relief partisan, vetoed the bill, but relief party legislators held a large majority in the General Assembly thanks to the previous fall's elections, and overrode the veto. The following February, the General Assembly passed an even more liberal stay law, preventing the collection of debts for one year if the creditor would accept payments in the devalued notes of the Bank of Kentucky and two years if they demanded payment in specie or specie-backed notes.Rothbard, p. 77 These actions were a precursor to the Old Court-New Court controversy. While Slaughter clashed with the General Assembly over potential solutions to the crisis at the state level, he adopted a strong states' rights policy at the national level. He challenged the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States and the Supreme Court's ruling that individual states could not tax branches of the Bank. Religious leadership and later life Following his term as governor, Slaughter failed in a bid to return to the state senate in 1821, but was re-elected to the state House of Representatives in 1823, serving a single term.Hopkins, p. 25 During this term, he continued to support measures to improve education. He voted to ask Congress for aid for the Deaf and Dumb School in the state, and opposed redirecting fines and forfeitures earmarked for the state's \\"Seminaries of Learning\\" into the state treasury. He was also named to a joint committee to investigate the use of state appropriations to Transylvania University.Dorman, pp. 352-353 Concurrent with his political career, Slaughter took a leading role in the affairs of his church. He was born into the tradition of the Church of England, but soon became associated with the Baptist congregation at Shawnee Run. He served as a messenger from this congregation to the various associations with which it was connected for over thirty years. One such association was the South District Association; Slaughter served as clerk at that body's annual meeting in 1808 and 1809, and later served as its moderator for nine years. In 1813, he helped found the Kentucky Bible Society.Dorman, p. 342 Following his term in the state House, Slaughter retired from politics and became an active lay minister of the Baptist faith. In 1829, he was appointed to the first board of trustees of Georgetown College, a Baptist college in Georgetown, Kentucky. He died on September 19, 1830, and was interred in his family's cemetery in Mercer County.

Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the \\"last days\\", the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned. In 1922 the society's principal journal, Watch Tower, described its chronology as \\"no stronger than its weakest link\\", but also claimed the chronological relationships to be \\"of divine origin and divinely corroborated...in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct\\"\\"The Strong Cable of Chronology\\", Watch Tower, July 15, 1922, page 217, \\"The chronology of present truth is, to begin with, a string of dates...

The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible.Revelation ‚Äì It's Grand Climax, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, page 9. Witness publications say that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower publications often cite Proverbs 4:18, \\"The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established\\" (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during \\"the time of the end\\", as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah's Witnesses state that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God's Kingdom and that they do not call their core beliefs into question.Why have there been changes over the years in the teachings of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses?,\\"Jehovah's Witnesses\\", Reasoning From the Scriptures, ¬©1989, Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, page 205\\"Allow No Place for the Devil!\\", The Watchtower, March 15, 1986, page 19\\"Keep in Step With Jehovah‚Äôs Organization\\", Watchtower, January 15, 2001, page 18. Current beliefs Jehovah's Witnesses teach the imminent end of the current world society, or \\"system of things\\" by God's judgment, leading to deliverance for the saved. This judgment will begin with false religion, which they identify as the \\"harlot\\", Babylon the Great,Revelation‚ÄîIts Grand Climax at Hand 1988, pages 235‚Äì236 pars. 2‚Äì3 \\"Judging the Infamous Harlot\\", ¬© Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of PennsylvaniaRevelation‚ÄîIts Grand Climax at Hand, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, pp. 205‚Äì206. referred to in the Book of Revelation. They apply this designation to all other religions. They do not currently place their expectations on any specific date, but believe that various events will lead up to the end of this \\"system of things\\", culminating in Armageddon. Armageddon is understood to include the destruction of all earthly governments by God. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth. They believe that after Armageddon, based on scriptures such as John 5:28, 29, the dead will gradually be resurrected to a \\"day of judgment\\" lasting for a thousand years.The Watchtower, May 15, 2006, p 6. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection, not on past deeds.Insight on the Scriptures, Vol. 2, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988,p. 788. At the end of the thousand years a final test will take place when Satan is brought back to mislead perfect mankind.The Watchtower, May 1, 2005, p. 20.

They state that the beginning of Christ's heavenly rule would seem worse initially for mankind because it starts with the casting out of Satan from heaven to the earth, which according to Revelation 12, would bring a brief period of \\"woe\\" to mankind.The Watchtower, February 1, 1996, p6.

The Witnesses' alternative chronology produces a 20-year gap between the reigns of Neo-Babylonian Kings Amel-Marduk (rule ended 560 BC) and Nabonidus (rule began 555 BC) in addition to the intervening reigns of Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk, despite the availability of contiguous cuneiform records.\\"Let Your Kingdom Come\\", Appendix, page 187: \\"Business tablets: Thousands of contemporary Neo- Babylonian cuneiform tablets have been found that record simple business transactions, stating the year of the Babylonian king when the transaction occurred.

History of eschatology Herald of the Morning published by Nelson H. Barbour and Charles Taze Russell in 1878Watch Tower Society eschatological teachings are based on the earliest writings of Charles Taze Russell, but have undergone significant changes since then. Many of the changes reflect altered views on the significance of the dates 1874, 1914, 1918, and 1925. =Early expectations (1871‚Äì1881)= The Second Adventists affiliated with Nelson H. Barbour expected a visible and dramatic return of Christ in 1873,Evidences for the Coming of the Lord in 1873: or the Midnight Cry, N.H. Barbour (1871). Available online at: http://www.heraldmag.org/olb/contents/history/barbour%20midnight%20cry.htm and later in 1874.The Midnight Cry and Herald of the Morning, March 1874. See Section under \\"Our Faith.\\" They agreed with other Adventist groups that the \\"time of the end\\" (also called the \\"last days\\") had started in 1799.Present Truth, Or Meat in Due Season by Jonas Wendell, pp. 34‚Äì35 Soon after the 1874 disappointment, Barbour's group decided Christ had returned to the earth in 1874, but invisibly. Writing in his journal The Herald of the Morning in 1875, Barbour outlined his eschatological views and connected the years 1874, 1878, 1881, and 1914. The \\"harvest\\" was to run from 1874 to the spring of 1878, concluding with \\"the translation of the living saints into the air.\\" 1881 would mark the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, and the period from 1881 until 1914 would see the installation of God's kingdom on earth. Barbour wrote that in the 40 years from 1874 to 1914 \\"the 'time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation;' will be fulfilled. And in the mean time, the kingdom of God will be set up, 'break in pieces, and consume all these [Gentile] kingdoms,' 'and the stone become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth,' and usher in glory of the millennial age\\". Russell became associated with Barbour in 1876 and accepted Barbour's eschatological understanding.The Watchtower reprints, \\"Harvest Gatherings and Siftings\\" , July 15, 1906, page 3822. In 1877, Barbour and Russell jointly issued the book Three Worlds and the Harvest of This World, which reiterated Barbour's earlier teachings.Three Worlds and The Harvest of This World by N.H. Barbour and C.T. Russell (1877). Text available online at: http://www.heraldmag.org/olb/contents/history/3worlds.pdf Scan of book in PDF format It proclaimed Christ's invisible return in 1874,Three Worlds, p. 175 the resurrection of the saints in 1875,Three Worlds, pp. 104‚Äì108 and predicted the end of the \\"harvest\\" and a rapture of the saints to heaven for 1878See pages 68, 89‚Äì93, 124, 125‚Äì126, 143 of Three Worlds. and the final end of \\"the day of wrath\\" in 1914.Three Worlds, p. 189: \\"the 'times of the Gentiles,' reach from B.C. 606 to A.D. 1914, or forty years beyond 1874. And the time of trouble, conquest of the nations, and events connected with the day of wrath, have only ample time, during the balance of this forty years, for their fulfillment.\\" 1874 was considered the end of 6000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ. The selection of 1878 as the year of the rapture of the saints was based on the application of parallel dispensations, which equated the 3¬Ω-year period of Christ's ministry with a similar \\"harvest\\" period following his parousia. When the rapture failed to occur, Russell admitted they \\"felt somewhat disappointed\\", but decided there would be an additional 3¬Ω-year period \\"making the harvest seven years long\\". Successive issues of The Herald of the Morning identified the autumn of 1881 as the end of the \\"Harvest\\" and the likely time for the translation of the Church to heaven. Russell split from Barbour over doctrinal differences and began publishing Zion's Watch Tower in July 1879. =Great Pyramid of Giza (1876‚Äì1928)= Watch Tower Society near C.T. Russell's grave in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania modeled after the Great Pyramid of Giza. Influenced by the pyramidology theories of John Taylor and Charles Piazzi Smyth, Nelson Barbour and Charles Russell taught that the Great Pyramid of Giza contained prophetic measurements in \\"pyramid inches\\" that pointed to both 1874 and 1914. Russell viewed the Great Pyramid as \\"God's Stone Witness and Prophet\\". Smyth reviewed Russell's manuscript on the Great Pyramid before publication and Russell credited him and Scottish writer Robert Menzies for the view \\"that the Great Pyramid is Jehovah's 'Witness', and that it was as important a witness to divine truth as to natural science.\\" (p. 320)Joseph Seiss' book A Miracle in Stone was also influential for Russell. Prophetic dates derived from the measurements inside the Great Pyramid were seen as complementary to biblical interpretations. Russell included the Great Pyramid as part of his film and color slide production The Photo-Drama of Creation in 1914, suggesting that the Great Pyramid was built by the Old Testament king-priest Melchizedek.Photo Drama of Creation , p. 25. Video of Russell discussing the Great Pyramid A special edition of the first volume of Studies in the Scriptures was also published, which was re-titled The Divine Plan of the Ages and the Corroborative Testimony of the Great Pyramid. (Google Books Version) In accordance with Russell's wishes, a high replica of a pyramid was erected at his gravesite in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with its capstone \\"patterned after the capstone of the Great Pyramid of Egypt, symbolic of the Christ.\\"Program of the 1921 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society: \\"The Pyramid monument erected at the grave of Brother Russell was sketched by Brother J.A. Bohnet and approved by Brother Russell several years ago. It was his desire that such a monument be erected on this lot and he set about to procure the materials before his death. After Brother Russell's death, Brother Rutherford, learning that Brother Russell had ordered the erection of this monument asked Brother Bohnet to proceed at once to get the material and let the contract for its construction and erection.\\"1919 Bible Student Convention Souvenir Booklet , pp. 6‚Äì7. Early Watch Tower publications cited \\"the testimony of the Great Pyramid\\" for expectations for 1910 and 1914. Russell's interpretations of the Great Pyramid were supported by the writings of John and Morton Edgar who were prominent members of his movement.The Edgars' 2 volume work Great Pyramid Passages and Chambers was advertised and sold in The Watchtower (August 1, 1910 Watch Tower Reprints , p. 4658; October 15, 1913 The Watchtower , page 306, Reprints p. 5336). Research by the Edgars on the Great Pyramid was published in the November 15, 1904 Watch Tower, Reprints, p. 3459, the June 15, 1905 Watch Tower, Reprints, p. 3574 and the June 1, 1910 The Watchtower, Reprints, p. 4621. John Edgar was named to be on the editorial committee for the Watch Tower magazine in the December 1, 1916 The Watchtower, (Reprints p. 5999), but had died before Russell. Research by Morton Edgar was published in the August 15, 1923 The Watchtower, pp. 253‚Äì254, the December 31, 1924 Golden Age, pp. 209‚Äì211 and on pp. 163, 355, 357 of the 1923 The Watchtower. Morton Edgar explained the spiritual meaning of the Great Pyramid in \\"God's Plan of Salvation in the Great Pyramid,\\" a lecture which was published in the 1911 Bible Students Convention Report Morton Edgar, on page 151 of the 1924 edition of the second volume of Great Pyramid Passages, refers to Judge Rutherford's booklet Millions Now Living Will Never Die as a \\"wonderful message of life.\\" Russell had first stated that 1874 was derived from a measurement of 3416 pyramid inches,Thy Kingdom Come (1904 edition‚ÄîMillennial Dawn, vol 3) p.342 but the measurement was revised in the 1910 edition to to point to 1915.Thy Kingdom Come (copyright 1891) (Studies In The Scriptures, vol. 3, 1910 edition) p.342 The Edgars claimed that the revision in measurement and change in date was a result of errors made by Smyth.Great Pyramid Passages and Chambers (1913), volume 2: \\"Professor C. Piazzi Smyth very properly says, \`no two human measures ever agree exactly.'\\" (Ibid p.1) According to the Edgars, Professor Smyth (from whom Russell gained his information) had not personally measured this passage since it was blocked. It had been roughly measured in 1837 by Col Howard Vyse, but the Edgars personally measured \\"the length of this passage seven times\\" and ended up with seven different measurements, though within a few inches. (Ibid p.8 ) In answering a question about different measurements of the pyramid, The Watchtower stated \\"that Prof. Smyth's interest centered in the upper chambers of the Pyramid ... Much less care and precision [were] manifested in his dealings with all other parts\\". (The Watchtower November 1904 p. 326 \\"The Great Pyramid Measurements\\") In the early 1920s, the significance of the pyramidological predictions for 1914 were re-interpreted to mean that \\"the old evil order began to pass away in 1914.\\" In 1924, an issue of Golden Age referred to the Great Pyramid as \\"the Scientific Bible\\" and added that measurements on the Grand Gallery inside the Great Pyramid confirmed the dates 1874, 1914 and 1925. Similarly, the 1924 publication The Way to Paradise refers to the Great Pyramid as \\"the Bible in Stone\\" and concludes: In 1928, the belief that the Great Pyramid contained a prophetic blueprint of biblical chronology was rejected, and the Pyramid was seen as built \\"under the direction of Satan the Devil.\\"The last favorable reference to the Great Pyramid in Watch Tower Society publications appears in The Watchtower, the April 15, 1928, p. 125Pyramidology was first rejected in the November 15, 1928 Watchtower, p 344: \\"It is more reasonable to conclude that the great pyramid of Gizeh, as well as the other pyramids thereabout, also the sphinx, were built by the rulers of Egypt and under the direction of Satan the Devil...The Devil, by the use of the descendants of Ham, set up Egypt, or the land of Ham, as the first great world power. Then Satan put his knowledge in dead stone, which may be called Satan's Bible, and not God's stone witness. In erecting the pyramid, of course, Satan would put in it some truth, because that is his method of practising fraud and deceit.\\" =\\"The Time Is At Hand\\" (1881‚Äì1918)= Some of Barbour's eschatology was retained by Russell after they parted company. Basing his interpretations on a concept of parallel \\"dispensations\\", Russell taught that while Jesus was invisibly present on earth he was also made its king in 1878. He believed God had rejected the \\"nominal Church\\" (considered to be \\"Babylon the Great\\") in 1878.Zion's Watch Tower, April 1883. Reprints pp. 474‚Äì5: \\"This spuing out, or casting off, of the nominal church as an organization in 1878, we then understood, and still proclaim, to be the date of the commencement of Babylon's fall...\\" Russell also taught that in 1878 Christ resurrected all the \\"dead in Christ\\" as spirit beings to be with him on earth awaiting a future glorification to heaven. (The remainder of the 144,000 who would die after 1878 would each be resurrected at the time of their death.) Together with Christ on earth, these invisible resurrected spirit beings were said to be engaged in directing a harvest work (running from 1874 to 1914) to gather the remainder of those with the heavenly calling.Thy Kingdom Come (1890), Volume 3 of Millennial Dawn, later retitled Studies in the Scriptures, p. 305‚Äì308. Russell later moderated his view about the significance of 1881, stating that the \\"door\\" for the gathering of the Bride of Christ \\"stands ajar.\\" In 1889, Charles Taze Russell published his interpretation of eschatology and chronology based on the idea of parallel \\"dispensations\\". He wrote that the culmination of Armageddon would occur in 1914, preceded by the gathering of all the saints (both resurrected and living) to heaven. Based on measurements from the Great Pyramid of Giza, this \\"passing beyond the vail\\" or rapture was expected \\"before the close of A.D. 1910.\\"Thy Kingdom Come, p. 364 : \\"this date, 1910, indicated by the pyramid ... we may accept as correct the testimony of the great pyramid, that the last members of the body or bride' of Christ will have been tested and accepted and will have passed beyond the vail before the close of A.D. 1910.\\"The New Creation, p.579: \\"According to our expectations the stress of the great time of trouble will be on us soon, somewhere between 1910 and 1912‚Äîculminating with the end of the 'Times of the Gentiles,' October, 1914.\\" (Later editions may read differently) Russell enumerated seven expectations for 1914 in The Time is at Hand: # God's kingdom would take full control of earth \\"on the ruins of present institutions\\"; # Christ would be present as earth's new ruler; # The last of the \\"royal priesthood, the body of Christ\\" would be glorified with Christ; # Jerusalem would no longer \\"be trodden down by the Gentiles\\"; # \\"Israel's blindness will begin to be turned away\\"; # The great \\"time of trouble\\" would reach its culmination of worldwide anarchy; # God's Kingdom would \\"smite and crush the Gentile image‚Äîand fully consume the power of these kings\\".The Time is at Hand, pages 76‚Äì78. Post 1914 editions read differently--1917 edition. In 1911 Russell wrote that October 1914 would witness the \\"full end\\" of Babylon, or nominal Christianity, \\"utterly destroyed as a system\\".Zion's Watch Tower, June 15, 1911, page 190. At first, the hopes for 1914 were stretched to \\"near the end of A.D. 1915.\\" The Time is at Hand, 1915 ed., p. 99: \\"In view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth, that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the Kingdom of God, will be accomplished near the end of A.D. 1915. Then the prayer of the church, ever since her Lord took his departure ‚Äì 'Thy kingdom come' ‚Äì will be answered; and under that wise and just administration, the whole earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord\\" (Later editions have 1914 instead of 1915) A few months before his death in October 1916, Russell wrote: \\"We believe that the dates have proven to be quite right. We believe that Gentile Times have ended. ... The Lord did not say that the Church would all be glorified by 1914. We merely inferred it, and, evidently, erred.\\" He interpreted the war in Europe to be the first of three phases of ArmageddonThe Watchtower, September 1, 1916: \\"Our eyes of understanding should discern clearly the Battle of the Great Day of God Almighty now in progress.\\" and the destruction of Christendom to take place in 1918. Following Russell's lead, the book The Finished Mystery The Finished Mystery from Google Book Search. Published in 1917 by the Watch Tower Society. It was considered to be volume 7 of Studies in the Scriptures. PDF version of The Finished Mystery. Later editions read differently. emphasized events for 1918. The destruction of the churches of Christendom and the deaths of \\"church members by the millions\\" was expected in 1918. The Finished Mystery, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1917, Page 485: \\"Also, in the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale and the church members by millions, it shall be that any that escape shall come to the works of Pastor Russell to learn the meaning of the downfall of 'Christianity.'\\" The Finished Mystery, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1917,Pages 398‚Äì9: \\"The people who are the strength of Christendom shall be cut off in the brief but terribly eventful period beginning in 1918 A.D. A third part are 'burned with fire in the midst of the city.' Fire symbolizes destruction ... After 1918 the people supporting churchianity will cease to be its supporters, be destroyed as adherents, by the spiritual pestilence of errors abroad, and by the famine of the Word of God among them.\\" The Finished Mystery proposed the spring of 1918 for the glorification of the Church The Finished Mystery, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1917, Page 64. Page 177 and suggested that it may occur on the day of Passover in that year. First printings of The Finished Mystery predicted the end of the World War \\"some time about October 1, 1917,\\" but this was changed in subsequent editions. It also predicted the destruction of governments in 1920.The Finished Mystery, 1917 edition, p.258. 258\\\\. (This date is changed in later editions.) =\\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die!\\" (1918‚Äì1925)= The predictions for 1920 were discarded before that year arrived, in favor of a new chronology. In 1918‚Äì1919, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, second president of the Watch Tower Society, inaugurated a worldwide lecture series entitled \\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die!\\", later reproduced in booklet form. It provided a re-interpretation of the significance of the year 1914 (now seen as the beginning of the \\"last days\\"). It also included new predictions for 1925 including the resurrection of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and other Old Testament personages (referred to as \\"princes\\"). (Page 89 from Google Book Version) Their return would mark the beginning of a new order, from which time millions of people alive at that time would be able to live forever. Newspaper advertisements for the \\"Millions\\" lecture localized the claim, with a typical declaration in a Marion, Ohio newspaper reading: \\"It will be conclusively proved... that thousands now living in Marion and vicinity will never die.\\"The Marion Star, Marion, Ohio, April 9, 1921. The Bridgeport Telegram, Bridgeport, Connecticut, December 4, 1920. Scans available at News Clippings from the \\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\\" Campaign (1919‚Äì1925) The book stated that 1925 would be among the dates \\"stamped with God's approval\\" and The Watch Tower described the evidence for the chronology surrounding 1925 as stronger than that for 1914,The Watchtower, September 1, 1922, p. 262, \\"The date 1925 is even more distinctly indicated by the Scriptures than 1914.\\"The Watchtower May 15, 1922, p. 147, 150, \\"We have no doubt whatever in regard to the chronology relating to the dates of 1874, 1914, 1918, and 1925 ... There can be no more question about 1925 than there was about 1914.\\" but acknowledged disappointments surrounding earlier predictions and cautioned that \\"all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year\\", and that the expectations could be \\"a means of testing and sifting.\\"The Watchtower, May 15, 1922, p. 150, \\"Noting the date marked so prominently, it is very easy for the finite mind to conclude that all the work to be done must center about it, and thus many are inclined to anticipate more than has been really foretold. Thus it was in 1844, in 1874, in 1878 as well as in 1914 and 1918. Looking back we can now easily see that those dates were clearly indicated in Scripture and doubtless intended by the Lord to encourage his people, as they did, as well as to be a means of testing and sifting when all that some expected did not come to pass. That all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year will not alter the date one whit more than in the other cases.\\" When 1925 also passed uneventfully, meeting attendance among the Bible Students dropped dramatically in some congregations and attendance at the annual Memorial fell from 90,434 to 17,380 between 1925 and 1928. Annual Memorial attendances were 17,961 (1919), 32,661 (1922), 42,000 (1923) 62,696 (1924), 90,434 (1925), 89,278 (1926) and 17,380 (1928). Statistics were also published each year in the Watchtower until 1926 In 1935, Memorial attendance had increased again to 63,146. =\\"Armageddon Immediately Before Us\\" (1925‚Äì1966)= 223x223pxFrom 1920 until 1930, the Watch Tower Society, under Rutherford's leadership, radically changed much of its chronologies after the failure of these eschatological expectations. In July 1920, the Watch Tower first declared that Christ had been enthroned as king in heaven in 1914, not 1878.\\"Gospel of the Kingdom\\". The Watch Tower. July 1, 1920. \\"It is well known that at this time the first universal Gentile empire was established, with Nebuchadnezzar as the ruler; and the Gentile times beginning there covered a period of seven symbolic times, or 2,520 years. The date of the beginning being 606 B. C., it would follow that the Gentile times would end in 1914; i. e., the legal lease of power would at that time expire and then the time would be due for him ‚Äúwhose right it is‚Äù to receive and exercise kingly authority.\\" A 1927 Watch Tower transferred the timing of the resurrection of the \\"saints\\" from 1878 to 1918,Light, Book One, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1930, p. 78.: \\"In June, 1927, the Watch Tower published the proof from the Scriptures that those who thus died faithful were asleep in death until the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918.\\" explaining that they would be raised as spirit creatures to heavenly life to be with Christ there.J.F.

If you are in high school and thinking about a college education, it means at least four, perhaps even six or eight more years to graduate into a specialized career. But where will this system of things be by that time? It will be well on the way towards its finish, if not actually gone!

B4 =The \\"generation of 1914\\" (1976‚Äìpresent)= After the passing of 1975, the Watch Tower Society continued to emphasize the teaching that God would execute his judgment on humankind before the generation of people who had witnessed the events of 1914 had all died.The Watchtower, May 1, 1985, p.4.The Watchtower, May 15, 1984 This teaching was based on an interpretation of Matthew 24:34 (\\"Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur\\"), with the term \\"a generation\\" said to refer \\"beyond question\\" to a generation living in a given period. The term had been used with regard to the nearness of Armageddon from the 1940s, when the view was that \\"a generation\\" covered a period of about 30 to 40 years. As the 40-year deadline passed without Armageddon occurring, the definition of \\"a generation\\" underwent a series of changes: in 1952 it was said for the first time to mean an entire lifetime, possibly 80 years or more; in 1968 it was applied to those who had been at least 15 years old in 1914, who were considered to be \\"old enough to witness with understanding what took place when the 'last days' began\\" (italics theirs). In 1980 the starting date for that \\"generation\\" was brought into the 20th century when the term was applied to those who had been born in 1904 and therefore aged 10 and able simply \\"to observe\\" when World War I had begun. The Watchtower commented: \\"The fact that their number is dwindling is one more indication that 'the conclusion of the system of things' is moving fast toward its end.\\" From 1982 to 1995, the inside cover of Awake! magazine included, in its mission statement, a reference to the \\"generation of 1914\\", alluding to \\"the Creator's promise ... of a peaceful and secure new world before the generation that saw the events of 1914 passes away.\\" In 1985, Witnesses were reminded: \\"The 1914 generation is well into the evening of its existence, thus allowing only little time for this prophecy yet to be fulfilled.\\".The Watchtower, May 1, 1985, p.7. Former Governing Body member Raymond Franz claimed members of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses debated replacing the doctrine with a markedly different interpretation and that in 1980 Albert Schroeder, Karl Klein and Grant Suiter proposed moving the beginning of the \\"generation\\" to the year 1957, to coincide with the year Sputnik was launched. He said the proposal was rejected by the rest of the Governing Body.Crisis of Conscience, Raymond Franz p. 262.

Despite its earlier description as being \\"beyond question\\", the \\"generation of 1914\\" teaching was discarded in 1995. Rather than a literal lifespan of 70 to 80 years, the definition of \\"generation\\" was changed to \\"contemporary people of a certain historical period, with their identifying characteristics,\\" without reference to any specific amount of time.\\"Saved From a 'Wicked Generation'\\", The Watchtower (November 1) 1995, pp. 10‚Äì15.

Mention of 1914 was dropped from Awake! magazine's mission statement as of November 8, 1995. The Watchtower insisted, however, that Armageddon was still imminent, asking: \\"Does our more precise viewpoint on 'this generation' mean that Armageddon is further away than we had thought? Not at all!\\" In 2008 the \\"generation\\" teaching was again altered, and the term was used to refer to the \\"anointed\\" believers, some of whom would still be alive on earth when the great tribulation begins.The Watchtower, February 15, 2008, pages 23‚Äì24: \\"As a class, these anointed ones make up the modern-day \\"generation\\" of contemporaries that will not pass away \\"until all these things occur.\\"* This suggests that some who are Christ's anointed brothers will still be alive on earth when the foretold great tribulation begins.\\" This was a return to a belief previously held between 1927 The Watchtower, February 15, 1927, p. 62, \\"Interesting Questions\\". and 1950 when the teaching of the \\"generation of 1914\\" not passing away was adopted.The Watchtower, November 1, 1950, p. 419. In 2010, the teaching of the \\"generation\\" was modified again, to refer to \\"the anointed who were on hand when the sign began to become evident in 1914\\" and other \\"anointed\\" members whose lives \\"overlap\\" with the first group. In 2015, it was asserted that the \\"generation\\" would include any individuals \\"anointed\\" up until 1992 at the earliest. Controversy =Fall of Jerusalem= Jehovah's Witnesses assert that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC and completely uninhabited for exactly seventy years. This date is critical to their selection of October 1914 for the arrival of Christ in kingly power‚Äî2520 years after October 607 BC.Pay Attention to Daniel's Prophecy! chap. 6 par. 25‚Äì29 Non-Witness scholars do not support 607 BC for the event; most scholars date the destruction of Jerusalem to within a year of 587 BC, twenty years later.Edmond C. Gruss, Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation, Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, Page 42. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that periods of seventy years mentioned in the books of Jeremiah and Daniel refer to the Babylonian exile of Jews. They also believe that the gathering of Jews in Jerusalem, shortly after their return from Babylon, officially ended the exile in Jewish month of Tishrei (Ezra 3:1). According to the Watch Tower Society, October 607 BC is derived by counting back seventy years from Tishrei of 537 BC, based on their belief that Cyrus' decree to release the Jews during his first regnal year \\"may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4‚Äì5, 537 B.C.\\"\\"When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?‚ÄîPart One\\" The Watchtower, October 1, 2011, page 26 Non-Witness sources assign the return to either 538 BC or 537 BC. \\"Babylonian Exile.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online.

In The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology & Christ's Return, Carl O. Jonsson, a former Witness, presents eighteen lines of evidence to support the traditional view of neo-Babylonian chronology. He accuses the Watch Tower Society of deliberately misquoting sources in an effort to bolster their position.The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology & Christ's Return by Carl O. Jonsson. Publisher: Commentary Press (July, 1998, Fourth edition 2004) The Watch Tower Society claims that biblical chronology is not always compatible with secular sources, and that the Bible is superior. It claims that secular historians make conclusions about 587 BC based on incorrect or inconsistent historical records, but accepts those sources that identify Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BC, claiming it has no evidence of being inconsistent and hence can be used as a pivotal date.\\"When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?‚ÄîPart Two\\" The Watchtower, November 1, 2011, page 22Insight from scriptures. Vol.2 page 458, \\"secular chronologers calculate the 16th day of Tashritu (Tishri) as falling on October 11, Julian calendar, and October 5, Gregorian calendar, in the year 539 B.C.E.

Hedrick also owned and operated Larry Hedrick Motorsports, a NASCAR team that debuted in 1990 with driver Larry Pearson. The following season, Hedrick signed Kellogg's Corn Flakes for a limited schedule. Pearson was released at the end of the year in favor of Greg Sacks. Manheim Auctions joined the team as sponsor for 1993 with Dick Trickle and Phil Parsons sharing driving duties. The following year, Hedrick signed former Xfinity series champion Joe Nemechek for a run at Rookie of the Year. Nemechek left at season's end to run his own team and was replaced by Ricky Craven. Craven would go on to win Rookie of the Year in 1995. In 1996, Craven earned five top-10 finishes before accepting an offer from Hendrick Motorsports.

The entity referred to by these keywords thus depends on the execution context (such as which object is having its method called). Different programming languages use these keywords in slightly different ways. In languages where a keyword like \\"this\\" is mandatory, the keyword is the only way to access data and methods stored in the current object. Where optional, they can disambiguate variables and functions with the same name. Object- oriented programming In many object-oriented programming languages, \`this\` (also called \`self\` or \`Me\`) is a variable that is used in instance methods to refer to the object on which they are working. The first OO language, SIMULA 67, used \`this\` to explicitly reference the local object. C++ and languages which derive in style from it (such as Java, C#, D, and PHP) also generally use \`this\`. Smalltalk and others, such as Object Pascal, Perl, Python, Ruby, Rust, Objective-C, DataFlex and Swift, use \`self\`. Microsoft's Visual Basic uses \`Me\`. The concept is similar in all languages: \`this\` is usually an immutable reference or pointer which refers to the current object; the current object often being the code that acts as 'parent' to the property, method, sub-routine or function that contains the \`this\` keyword. After an object is properly constructed, or instantiated, \`this\` is always a valid reference. Some languages require it explicitly; others use lexical scoping to use it implicitly to make symbols within their class visible. Or alternatively, the current object referred to by \`this\` may be an independent code object that has called the function or method containing the keyword \`this\`. Such a thing happens, for example, when a JavaScript event handler attached to an HTML tag in a web page calls a function containing the keyword \`this\` stored in the global space outside the document object; in that context, \`this\` will refer to the page element within the document object, not the enclosing window object.Powell, Thomas A, and Schneider, Fritz, 2012. JavaScript: The Complete Reference, Third Edition. McGraw-Hill. Chapter 11, Event Handling, p 428. In some languages, for example C++ and Java, \`this\` or \`self\` is a keyword, and the variable automatically exists in instance methods. In others, for example Python, Rust, and Perl 5, the first parameter of an instance method is such a reference. It needs to be specified explicitly. In Python and Perl, the parameter need not necessarily be named \`this\` or \`self\`; it can be named freely by the programmer like any other parameter. However, by informal convention, the first parameter of an instance method in Perl or Python is named \`self\`. Rust requires the self object to be called \`&self;\` or \`self\`, depending on whether the invoked function borrows the invocant, or moves it in, respectively. Static methods in C++ or Java are not associated with instances but classes, and so cannot use \`this\`, because there is no object. In other languages, such as Ruby, Smalltalk, Objective-C, or Swift, the method is associated with a class object that is passed as \`this\`, and they are called class methods. For class methods, Python uses \`cls\` to access to the class object. Subtleties and difficulties When lexical scoping is used to infer \`this\`, the use of \`this\` in code, while not illegal, may raise warning bells to a maintenance programmer, although there are still legitimate uses of \`this\` in this case, such as referring to instance variables hidden by local variables of the same name, or if the method wants to return a reference to the current object, i.e. \`this\`, itself. In some compilers (for example GCC), pointers to C++ instance methods can be directly cast to a pointer of another type, with an explicit \`this\` pointer parameter.Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) - Bound member functions =Open recursion= The dispatch semantics of \`this\`, namely that method calls on \`this\` are dynamically dispatched, is known as open recursion, and means that these methods can be overridden by derived classes or objects. By contrast, direct named recursion or anonymous recursion of a function uses closed recursion, with early binding. For example, in the following Perl code for the factorial, the token \`__SUB__\` is a reference to the current function: use feature \\":5.16\\"; sub { my $x = shift; $x  0 ? 1 : $x * __SUB__->( $x - 1 ); } By contrast, in C++ (using an explicit \`this\` for clarity, though not necessary) the \`this\` binds to the object itself, but if the class method was declared \\"virtual\\" i.e. polymorphic in the base, it's resolved via dynamic dispatch (late binding) so that derived classes can override it. unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) { if (n  0) return 1; else return n * this->factorial(n - 1); } This example is artificial, since this is direct recursion, so overriding the \`factorial\` method would override this function; more natural examples are when a method in a derived class calls the same method in a base class, or in cases of mutual recursion.\\"Closed and Open Recursion\\", Ralf Hinze, July 2007Open Recursion, Lambda the Ultimate The fragile base class problem has been blamed on open recursion, with the suggestion that invoking methods on \`this\` default to closed recursion (static dispatch, early binding) rather than open recursion (dynamic dispatch, late binding), only using open recursion when it is specifically requested; external calls (not using \`this\`) would be dynamically dispatched as usual.\\"Selective Open Recursion: A Solution to the Fragile Base Class Problem\\", Jonathan Aldrich\\"Selective Open Recursion: A Solution to the Fragile Base Class Problem\\", Lambda the Ultimate The way this is solved in practice in the JDK is through a certain programmer discipline; this discipline has been formalized by C.

In Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, October 2000. also available as technical report TR #00-05d * No code invokes \`public\` methods on \`this\`. * Code that can be reused internally (by invocation from other methods of the same class) is encapsulated in a \`protected\` or \`private\` method; if it needs to be exposed directly to the users as well, then a wrapper \`public\` method calls the internal method. * The previous recommendation can be relaxed for pure methods.  Implementations  = C++ = Early versions of C++ would let the \`this\` pointer be changed; by doing so a programmer could change which object a method was working on. This feature was eventually removed, and now \`this\` in C++ is an r-value. Early versions of C++ did not include references and it has been suggested that had they been so in C++ from the beginning, \`this\` would have been a reference, not a pointer.Stroustrup: C++ Style and Technique FAQ C++ lets objects destroy themselves with the source code statement: \`delete this\`. = C# = The keyword \`this\` in C# works the same way as in Java, for reference types. However, within C# value types, \`this\` has quite different semantics, being similar to an ordinary mutable variable reference, and can even occur on the left side of an assignment. One use of \`this\` in C# is to allow reference to an outer field variable within a method that contains a local variable that has the same name. In such a situation, for example, the statement \`var n = localAndFieldname;\` within the method will assign the type and value of the local variable \`localAndFieldname\` to \`n\`, whereas the statement \`var n = this.localAndFieldname;\` will assign the type and value of the outer field variable to \`n\`.De Smet, Bart, 2011. C# 4.0 Unleashed. Sams Publishing, Indianapolis, USA. Chapter 4, Language Essentials, p 210. = D = In D \`this\` in a class, struct or union method refers to an immutable reference of the instance of the enclosing aggregate. Classes are reference types, structs and unions are value types. In the first version of D, the keyword \`this\` is used as a pointer to the instance of the object the method is bound to, while in D2 it has the character of an implicit \`ref\` function argument. = Dylan = In the programming language Dylan, which is an object-oriented language that supports multimethods and doesn't have a concept of \`this\`, sending a message to an object is still kept in the syntax. The two forms below work in the same way; the differences are just syntactic sugar. object.method(param1, param2) and method (object, param1, param2) = Eiffel = Within a class text, the current type is the type obtained from the current class. Within features (routines, commands and queries) of a class, one may use the keyword \`Current\` to reference the current class and its features. The use of the keyword \`Current\` is optional as the keyword \`Current\` is implied by simply referring to the name of the current class feature openly. For example: One might have a feature \`foo' in a class MY_CLASS and refer to it by: class MY_CLASS feature -- Access foo: INTEGER my_function: INTEGER do Result := foo end end NOTE: The line numbers are for reference purposes only. Eiffel does not have line numbers in the class text. However, there is a line number option in the Eiffel Studio IDE, which can be optionally turned on for reference purposes (e.g. pair programming, etc). Line #10 (above) has the implied reference to \`Current\` by the call to simple \`foo'. Line #10 (below) has the explicit reference to \`Current\` by the call to \`Current.foo'. class MY_CLASS feature -- Access foo: INTEGER my_function: INTEGER do Result := Current.foo end end Either approach is acceptable to the compiler, but the implied version (e.g. \`x := foo\`) is preferred as it is less verbose. As with other languages, there are times when the use of the keyword \`Current\` is mandated, such as: class MY_CLASS feature -- Access my_command \\\\-- Create MY_OTHER_CLASS with \`Current' local x: MY_OTHER_CLASS do create x.make_with_something (Current) end end In the case of the code above, the call on line #11 to make_with_something is passing the current class by explicitly passing the keyword \`Current\`. = Java = The keyword \`this\` is a Java language keyword that represents the current instance of the class in which it appears. It is used to access class variables and methods. Since all instance methods are virtual in Java, \`this\` can never be null.Barnes, D. and K√∂lling, M. Objects First with Java. \\"...the reason for using this construct [this] is that we have a situation that is known as name overloading - the same name being used for two different entities... It is important to understand that the fields and the parameters are separate variables that exist independently of each other, even though they share similar names. A parameter and a field sharing a name is not really a problem in Java.\\" = JavaScript = In JavaScript, which is a programming or scripting language used extensively in web browsers, \`this\` is an important keyword, although what it evaluates to depends on where it is used. * When used outside any function, in global space, \`this\` refers to the enclosing object, which in this case is the enclosing browser window, the \`window\` object. * When used in a function defined in the global space, what the keyword \`this\` refers to depends on how the function is called. When such a function is called directly (e.g. \`f(x)\`), \`this\` will refer back to the global space in which the function is defined, and in which other global functions and variables may exist as well (or in strict mode, it is \`undefined\`). If a global function containing \`this\` is called as part of the event handler of an element in the document object, however, \`this\` will refer to the calling HTML element. * When a method is called using the \`new\` keyword (e.g. \`var c = new Thing()\`) then within Thing \`this\` refers to the Thing object itself. * When a function is attached as a property of an object and called as a method of that object (e.g. \`obj.f(x)\`), \`this\` will refer to the object that the function is contained within.Crockford, Douglas, 2008. JavaScript: The Good Parts. O'Reilly Media Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. Chapter 4, Functions, p 28. Powell, Thomas A, and Schneider, Fritz, 2012. JavaScript: The Complete Reference, Third Edition. McGraw-Hill. Chapter 5, Functions, pp 170-1\\\\. It is even possible to manually specify \`this\` when calling a function, by using the \`.call()\` or \`.apply()\` methods of the function object.Goodman, Danny, with Morrison, Michael, 2004. JavaScript Bible, 5th Edition. Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, USA. Chapter 33, Functions and Custom Objects, p 987. For example, the method call \`obj.f(x)\` could also be written as \`obj.f.call(obj, x)\`. To work around the different meaning of \`this\` in nested functions such as DOM event handlers, it is a common idiom in JavaScript to save the \`this\` reference of the calling object in a variable (commonly called \`that\` or \`self\`), and then use the variable to refer to the calling object in nested functions. For example: // In this example $ is a reference to the jQuery library $(\\".element\\").hover(function() { // Here, both this and that point to the element under the mouse cursor. var that = this; $(this).find('.elements').each(function() { // Here, this points to the DOM element being iterated. // However, that still points to the element under the mouse cursor. $(this).addClass(\\"highlight\\"); }); }); = Lua = In Lua, \`self\` is created as syntactic sugar when functions are defined using the \`:\` operator.https://www.lua.org/pil/16.html When invoking a method using \`:\`, the object being indexed will be implicitly given as the first argument to the function being invoked. For example, the following two functions are equivalent: local obj = {} function obj.foo(arg1, arg2) print(arg1, arg2) -- cannot use \\"self\\" here end function obj:bar(arg) print(self, arg) -- \\"self\\" is an implicit first argument before arg end \\\\-- All functions can be invoked both ways, with \\".\\" or with \\":\\" obj:foo(\\"Foo\\") -- equivalent to obj.foo(obj, \\"Foo\\") obj.bar(obj, \\"Bar\\") -- equivalent to obj:bar(\\"Bar\\") Lua itself is not object-oriented, but when combined with another feature called metatables, the use of \`self\` lets programmers define functions in a manner resembling object- oriented programming. = PowerShell = In PowerShell the special automatic variable \`$_\` contains the current object in the pipeline object. You can use this variable in commands that perform an action on every object or on selected objects in a pipeline. \\"one\\", \\"two\\", \\"three\\"  % { write $_ } Also starting with PowerShell 5.0, which adds a formal syntax to define classes and other user-defined types, \`$this\` variable describes the current instance of the object. = Python = In Python, there is no keyword for \`this\`. When a member function is called on an object, it invokes the member function with the same name on the object's class object, with the object automatically bound to the first argument of the function. Thus, the obligatory first parameter of instance methods serves as \`this\`; this parameter is conventionally named \`self\`, but can be named anything. In class methods (created with the \`classmethod\` decorator), the first argument refers to the class object itself, and is conventionally called \`cls\`; these are primarily used for inheritable constructors,Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2, Guido van Rossum, \\"Overriding the __new__ method\\" where the use of the class as a parameter allows subclassing the constructor. In static methods (created with the \`staticmethod\` decorator), no special first argument exists. = Rust = In Rust, types are declared separately from the functions associated with them. Functions designed to be analogous to instance methods in more traditionally object-oriented languages must explicitly take \`self\` as their first parameter. These functions can then be called using \`instance.method()\` syntax sugar. For example: This defines a type, \`Foo\`, which has four associated functions. The first, \`Foo::new()\`, is not an instance function and must be specified with the type prefix. The remaining three all take a \`self\` parameter in a variety of ways, and can be called on a \`Foo\` instance using the dot-notation syntax sugar, which is equivalent to calling the type- qualified function name with an explicit \`self\` first parameter. let foo = Foo::new(); // must called as a type-specified function foo.refer(); // prints \\"0\\". Foo::refer() has read-only access to the foo instance foo.mutate(5); // mutates foo in place, permitted by the &mut; specification foo.consume(); // prints \\"5\\" and destroys foo, as Foo::consume() takes full ownership of self // equivalent to foo.refer() Foo::refer(foo); // compilation error: foo is out of scope = Self = The Self language is named after this use of \\"self\\". = Xbase++ = \`Self\` is strictly used within methods of a class. Another way to refer to \`Self\` is to use \`::\`.  See also    References  Further reading * Meyers, Scott, 1995. More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Natchitoches was a residential episcopal see of the Catholic Church from 1853 to 1910 and is now a titular see. History Originally, the bishopric of Natchitoches was the Catholic Diocese for the central portions of Louisiana--all the northern part of Louisiana above 31¬∞ N. lat., with an area of 22,212 square miles--when it was established on July 29, 1853. The diocese was headquartered in Natchitoches, Louisiana. The see city was later relocated to Alexandria, Louisiana and the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Alexandria. Since that time the Diocese of Natchitoches has been maintained as a titular see. Antonio Margil was the first priest to minister within the territory now forming the diocese. From the Ays Indians, west of the Sabine river, Father Margil heard of the Adayes Indians, and in March, 1717, he located them near Spanish Lake, in what became Sabine Parish, Louisiana, founded the mission of San Miguel de Linares and built there probably the first church in Louisiana, for according to the historian Martin, when Pere Charlevoix reached New Orleans in 1721, he found there \\"about 100 cabins, two or three dwelling houses and a miserable storehouse which had been at first occupied as a chapel, a shed being now used for that purpose\\". Leaving Father Gusman in charge, Father Margil journeyed on foot to Natchitoches to minister to the French Catholics there, and then went back to Texas. In 1718, during the brief war with Spain, Blondel, the French Commandant at Natchitoches, invaded the Adayes mission, plundered it and carried away the church vestments. Father Margil heard of it, and in 1721 came back, hunted up the Adayes who had taken refuge in the forests for fear of the French, rebuilt their church, which he dedicated to Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of the expedition. For many years afterward the Adayes mission was attended from San Antonio by the Franciscans, who attended also the missions of Nacogdoches and St. Augustin, Texas. In 1725 there were 50 Catholic families at Natchitoches. In 1728 Father Maximin, a Capuchin, was in charge. There is no record to show how the eastern portion of the diocese was evangelized; but the Catholic names given to villages and lakes contiguous to the Mississippi, show that priests must have visited that country, probably the Jesuits, who in the 18th century had charge of the Indians along the Mississippi under the Bishop of Quebec. The records show that in 1829 Father Martin of Avoyelles attended the Catholics on the Red, Black and Ouachita rivers; that, in 1840 and after, Father J. Timon, afterwards Bishop of Buffalo, made regular trips from Texas to attend the north Louisiana missions, and that Father O'Brien, a Dominican from Louisville, attended yearly the Catholics along the Mississippi. The Catholics located on the rivers of the state often drifted to New Orleans on barges to have their marriages blessed and their children baptized, and come back cordelling their boats. In 1852 the Fathers of the First Council of Baltimore recommended to the Holy See the division of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, the formation of the Diocese of Natchitoches and the appointment of Father Martin, parish priest at Natchitoches, as its first bishop. Consecrated in 1853, he had four priests in the new diocese, three of whom returned to New Orleans, to which diocese they belonged, and one remained. Bishop Augustus Marie Martin (1802‚Äì1875), born in Brittany, inherited the deep faith of the Bretons. A prot√©g√© of Abbe Jean- Marie de Lamennais, as a seminarian, he was employed at the great Almonry of France in Paris under Cardinal Prince de Troy and Vicar-General J.-M. de Lamennais. There he came in contact with Montalembert and other disciples of Felicite Lamennais and acquired the polished manners that never left him. In 1839, while chaplain of the royal college in Rennes, he met Bishop C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re of Vincennes, came to Indiana with him, and for six years was his vicar-general. His health failing, he came to Louisiana, and in 1852 was vicar-general of Mgr. Blanc of New Orleans. Bishop Martin left a collection of unpublished letters that tell the history of his diocese, his struggles with poverty, his many trips to France to recruit his clergy. A fluent writer, his letters to the Propagation of the Faith were inserted in the \\"Annals\\"; the bishops of the Second Council of Baltimore and those of the provincial Council of New Orleans delegated him to write letters of thanks to the directors of the Propagation of the Faith for their generous contributions. Both letters were reproduced in \\"Les Missions Catholiques\\". Bishop Martin left an organized diocese with 20 priests, the Sisters of the Sacred Heart with one convent at Natchitoches, and the Daughters of the Cross with their mother-house and several convents in the diocese. He was succeeded by Bishop F. X. Leray, also a Breton, the hero of several yellow fever epidemics, and the founder of the Sisters of Mercy in the Diocese of Natchez. He remained in Natchitoches only two years, being selected as coadjutor to the Archbishop of New Orleans. He died in 1887. Bishop Anthony Durier succeeded him. Born near Lyon in southern France, he came to this country in 1855, was pastor in New Orleans for 26 years and one of the theologians of the Second Council of Baltimore. Consecrated in 1885, he died in 1904, having finished the cathedral and built an episcopal residence at Natchitoches. Right Rev. Cornelius Van De Ven, born at Oirschot, Holland, 16 June 1865, who studied in the diocesan seminary of Den Bosch, was ordained 31 May 1890, and came to America the same year. After filling important posts in the Archdiocese of New Orleans, he was consecrated Bishop of Natchitoches 30 November 1904. The most important act of his administration has been the transferring of the see from the inaccessible town of Natchitoches to the progressive city of Alexandria, a railroad centre with a large Catholic population. He went to Rome in 1910 and requested Pius X for the removal of the see. In August 1910, he received from the Consistorial Congregation the decree suppressing the See of Natchitoches and creating the See of Alexandria. In the early 20th century the new See of Alexandria, with a Catholic population of about 32,431, numbered 26 diocesan priests, 10 regulars (Jesuits and Marists), the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, the Daughters of the Cross with mother-house at Shreveport, the Sisters of Divine Providence and the Sisters of the Incarnate Word.

Retrieved 3 June 2018 Course The Findhorn rises in the Coignafearn Forest north of the main massif of the Monadhliath Mountains, several streams joining together near the Dalbeg bothy to form it. The westernmost of these is the River Eskin which flows down through a small valley surrounded by the heights of C√†rn a' Choire Sheilich , C√†rn nan L√†raiche Maoile and C√†rn na Saobhaidh . To the south west the Abhainn Cro- chlach takes a direct route along a narrow and steep-sided defile that carries its waters from Carn Odhar na Criche and C√†rn B√†n . The two join by a small bridge in the heart of the Coignafearn Forest (which is a Scottish deer forest and devoid of trees). Arguably this is the point, some above sea level, at which the Findhorn itself is born but less than kilometre downstream the Allt Creagach joins them at Dalbeg and from here on this is unquestionably the Findhorn River. Strath Dearn descends from here in a southwesterly direction until the river reaches its outlet to the Moray Firth. Findhorn River near its headwaters in the Coignafearn deer forest In its upper reaches the river is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers. The next tributary to join the flow is the Elrick Burn, a substantial rivulet whose head waters are in the Monadhliaths east of the Abhainn Cro-chlach. Its confluence with the Findhorn is just south of the Coignafearn Lodge. further east is the first wooded area of the valley, on the left bank below Creag Irealis and just upstream from Coignafearn Old Lodge. Some downstream beyond the cliffs of Creag Dubh the valley takes on a definitely wooded appearance, although the surrounding hills remain bare heather moor. Gorge at Dulsie Bridge The Glenmazaran Burn is the next tributary on the right bank, and various farms and lodges provide habitation from here throughout most of the river's remaining length. Tomatin is the first settlement of any size on the river's banks and here the waters pass under both the Highland Main Line railway and the A9 road. Just beyond this the Allt Bruachaig tumbles down from the heights of the Slochd Mor and joins the Findhorn on its right bank. Here the river takes its only major bend, a lazy S-shape over a stretch at the end of which the Funtack Burn, which drains Loch Moy to the north, joins the Findhorn's left bank. Beyond this point the character of the landscape changes again as the river enters the Streens gorge. This long defile has no metalled road, is largely treeless and almost completely uninhabited. At Drynachan lodge the valley reverts to its earlier wooded and inhabited character and roads again follow its course almost all the way to the sea. The river is joined by the Carnoch Burn and flows almost due east from here, passing the contour, and then shortly afterwards it is met by the Tor Burn on the right bank. This stream is only about a long, being formed by the confluence of the Rhilean and Leonach Burns, which flow through moorland before cascading down narrow gorges and over waterfalls in their final sections. There is a small, wooded river island in the Findhorn at the point at which it is joined by the Tor Burn - one of the few such islands along its length, none of which are named by the Ordnance Survey. Next, the river reaches the remains of the hillfort of Dunearn just south of Dulsie Bridge. Here the Findhorn turns northwards and flows through a sinuous and narrow gorge with Glenferness House on the right bank and the Ardclach bell tower on the left, after which it reverts to a generally north-westerly course once it passes under the A939 bridge. Beyond Relugas the Findhorn is joined by the River Divie at the beauty spot of Randolph's Leap. The Divie's head waters lie in the hills to the south of the prominent Knock of Braemoray, and shortly before its confluence with the Findhorn it is itself joined by the Dorback Burn, which is fed by Lochindorb. Hereafter the waters provide kayaking opportunities for the experienced for the next Findhorn Bay from the air with the channel of the River Findhorn at top centre and the Muckle Burn at top right Further downstream the Findhorn passes Logie House, the ruined hill fort of Dun Earn, Sluie Walk where it crosses the contour, the Altyre estate and the Meads of St John before reaching the hamlet of Mundole just outside the town of Forres, which is by far the largest settlement on the river's route. Passing under the Findhorn Bridge on the A96 and the main Inverness to Aberdeen railway line the river finally reaches relatively flat land just before it reaches Findhorn Bay. This is a large tidal basin and at low water the river is joined by the Muckle, Mosset and Kinloss Burns as it flows unimpeded over its sands. The combined streams flow on to the north with the village and military base of Kinloss to the right, crossing the bay and passing Findhorn Ecovillage and the harbour of the village of Findhorn before exiting the bay through a narrow, sandy channel and entering the Moray Firth with the Culbin Forest on the left. At higher stages of the tide the riverine waters mix with the incoming sea, creating a brackish lagoon. Etymology The white sands of the beach at Findhorn The derivation of the name 'Findhorn' is not absolutely clear. Watson (1926) states that it is derived from Gaelic Fionn √àire, meaning \\"white Ireland\\" which \\"doubtless refers to the white sands of the estuary\\". The genitive √àireann then gave rise to the use of the anglicized 'earn' or 'erne' in other local names such as Invererne and Dunearn. 'Burn' is a Scots language word for stream although most of the names referred to above are of Gaelic origin. Other common tributary names include abhainn (river or stream) and allt (brook, burn or stream). Monadhliath is Am Monadh Liath in Gaelic and means grey mountain range and C√†rn means a cairn or heap of stones. Coignafearn is from C√≥ig na Fe√†rna and means \\"the fifth of the alder\\", in this case \\"fifth\\" referring to a fraction of a davoch, a land measurement that could be subdivided into halves, quarters or fifths. Amongst the main settlements Tomatin is from Tom Aitinn meaning \\"juniper hillock\\", Forres is from farrais, a small copse and Kinloss from cinn lois, herb headland. Geology and geomorphology Map of the distribution of the Moine Supergroup on mainland Scotland and the Inner Hebrides During the Caledonian orogeny, some 500 mya, much of the land that is now northern Scotland was subject to folding and metamorphosis and then intruded with granite magma which contributed to the uplift of the area and ultimately the creation of the Grampian mountains of which the Monadliaths that form the head waters of the river Findhorn are a part. The bedrock of the upper Findhorn is largely made up of the Grampian Division of the Moine Supergroup, a formation that stretched from south of Forres to Lochindorb and beyond. These rocks are typically metamorphosed sediments of sandstone that are rich in quartz mixed with some shale and mudstone that date from circa 750 mya. The schists that underlay the Streens in the middle reaches of the Findhorn were once thought to be part of the younger Dalriadan Supergroup but are now considered to be Moinian as well. The Grampian Slide is a zone of shearing between the younger Grampian Division and the older Central Highland Division. In the lower Findhorn the bedrock is Old Red Sandstone that was deposited after the Caledonian orogeny. The rapid uplift of the mountain terrain to the south was accompanied by similarly rapid river erosion that resulted in sediment being spread throughout the Moray Firth basin and further north to Orkney and Shetland some 360‚Äì400 mya. At this time the land lay some 20 degrees south of the equator and experienced a semi-arid climate. During the Tertiary period some 65‚Äì50 mya volcanic activity on what is now the west coast of Scotland resulted in considerable uplift there and the creation of the slope that dips in an easterly direction that the modern Findhorn river follows. With the onset of Pleistocene glacial period some 2 mya the whole of northern Scotland became ice-bound. For example, the Cairngorm mountains immediately to the south of the Findhorn valley became covered in ice some thick. The melting of the ice, which occurred comparatively rapidly, resulted in \\"vast volumes of meltwater\\" creating further erosional and depositional features, such as river terraces in the middle reaches of the Findhorn and moraines such as the Cluny hills downstream. Looking from the Culbin forest towards the shifting coastal sand bars with the Moray Firth beyond The great weight of the ice depressed the land surface and with the end of the glacial period there resulted both sea level rises and isostatic rebound of the land which combined with periodic uplifts resulted in a complex interplay of land and sea with a prominent raised shoreline between Nairn and Forres that skirts the Culbin Forest. However, the shores have not been static even in historic times. The earliest detailed map of the Findhorn estuary dates from 1590 and was made by Timothy Pont. It shows a long sand bar stretching west from the site of the village of Findhorn along the Culbin shore. In 1701 this bar was described as being long after it was breached by the sea close its eastern edge. At this point what is now the Culbin Forest on the river's left bank was a sandy waste with dunes reaching to in height and the river channel through Findhorn Bay was slowly shallowing due to the wind-blown sands. Noticing the erosion to the bar, on which the village had been built, the inhabitants gradually deserted this site and moved to a new location about to the south east, where the modern village now stands.

Forres Castle stood on the east bank of the Mosset Burn. It may have been the place where King Dub was murdered in 966. Forres was a Royal Burgh from an unknown early date ‚Äì the original charter having been lost and then renewed in 1496. Kinloss Abbey was founded in 1150 under the rule of the Cistercian order but only ruins now remain, Alexander Brodie of Lethen having reduced it for its stones in 1651. In 1303 Edward I of England stayed at Lochindorb castle for a month during his military occupation of Scotland. Originally built by the Comyns, the structure sat on an island in the loch. Perhaps the most notorious resident of the Findhorn valley was Alexander Stewart, the Wolf of Badenoch, who was based at the castle and who burned Forres, Pluscarden Abbey and Elgin in 1390. In 1455 it was reduced by the Thane of Cawdor on the orders of James II and only the outer walls now remain. Modern era The village of Findhorn Various places are claimed to have been where the last wolf in Scotland was slain. One such story is that of a deer stalker called MacQueen who shot one on Clan Mackintosh land in the Findhorn valley in 1743. In the wake of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion the French brigantine Le Bien Trouv√© slipped past a British blockade in March 1746 into Findhorn Bay. The bay was too shallow for larger British frigates and sloops and although HMS Hawk opened fire no damage was caused. On the night of 6 April the Frenchman slipped out again carrying Bonnie Prince Charlie's aide- de-camp Richard Warren and escaped safely to Dunkirk. The Findhorn valley was badly affected by the Highland Clearances \\"which had a tragic impact not only upon remote glens but also upon the Moray Firth as a whole. From it arose the lamentations of a whole people... They had been taught to see themselves as the descendants of 'conquerors' who had won an inalienable right to the land in which they were settled. To them the rebuke of the Canadian Boat Song was well merited\\". If the clearances were a man-made travail, the Muckle Spate of 1829 was a natural disaster unparalleled in the historic record of the Findhorn. On 3 August of that year heavy rain in the Cairngorms resulted in flooding in the catchment of several rivers in north-east Scotland and that of the Findhorn has been described as \\"the most severe catastrophic flood in modern UK history\\". Based on the eyewitness accounts recorded by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder (who was also the author of a romantic history about the life of the \\"Wolf of Badenoch\\") were able to determine peak flows down the main river of up to 1,484 m3/sec and 451 m3/sec on the Divie. Lauder describes numerous incidents including the daring rescues of those trapped by the floods on the plain of Forres by fishermen from Findhorn village. It is at Randolph's Leap that the Findhorn river is at its most spectacular in spate. Here there are two markers indicating the height the river reached in 1829 and it is said that the butler at nearby Relugas caught a salmon above the normal river level in his umbrella. Between 1919 and 1963 the Forestry Commission planted some of trees on the Culbin sands and created what is now an extensive conifer plantation. During the early 21st century Moray Council undertook a flood prevention scheme on the Mosset Burn to protect the town of Forres up to a standard of a 1 in 100 years event. The principle component of the project is a 3.8 million m3 flood storage reservoir at Chapelton to the south of the town.Gowans, Ian; Moysey, Daniel; Winfield, Paul (2010)\\"Chapelton Flood Storage Reservoir\\". The British Dam Society. Notable buildings The Findhorn valley has a wide variety of listed buildings, several of which are the main residence of Highland estates. These include Dunphail House, on the River Divie, built on the site of a 14th-century castle, the white harled and crowstepped Logie House near Randolph's Leap, Darnaway Castle with its 15th- century Earl Randolph's Hall, described as \\"unique in non-Royal castles\\" and Altyre, which has a 19th-century Italianate farm steading, \\" now used by Glasgow School of Art.\\"The Creative Campus, Highlands and Islands\\". Glasgow School of Art. Retrieved 4 June 2018. Brodie Castle, which lies to the west in the vale of the Muckle Burn, has large formal gardens and was visited by Robert Burns in 1787. Forres Tolbooth In Forres the Tolbooth on the High Street is to an 1838 design with a 3-staged tower and cupola based on the c.1700 version (itself an addition to the original). Cluny Hill College, originally a hydropathic hotel dates to 1863 and \\"has a rambling skyline of dutch gables, ordinary gables, chimneys, parapets and bays\\". The octagonal Nelson's Tower on the summit of the nearby Cluny Hills is a prominent landmark that was erected in 1806 to celebrate Nelson‚Äôs victory at Trafalgar. The Universal Hall is an arts and conference centre at Findhorn Ecovillage that enjoys a stained glass window by American artist James Hubbel. At the heart of the village of Findhorn are the 1739 Crown and Anchor Inn and Findhorn House, the home of the Royal Findhorn Yacht Club, which is an 18th-century house with late 19th-century enlargements. Ecology and leisure Agriculture and forestry are practiced throughout the length of the land on the Findhorn's banks, but leisure activities are also an important aspect of the river and its catchment. On the high moors which are the source of the headwaters, red deer and grouse shooting are significant activities. Hill walking and bird watching are also important aspects of local tourism. Here, hardy plant species such as heather and Juniper thrive on the peaty soils and in the sheltered valley there are stands of Scots pine.

Aphids form their main diet and they are used for the biological control of these pests. Range Convergent lady beetles are native to North America, but have also been imported and established in South America by importing beetles from California. Life cycle The female lady beetle lays 200 to 300 eggs over several months during spring and early summer. The eggs are small and spindle-shaped and are laid near the prey in upright batches of fifteen to thirty eggs. The larvae are dark and somewhat alligator- shaped.Cornell University Once the larvae begin feeding, they grow quickly and molt four times over a period of up to a month. The pupal stage lasts about a week and mating takes place soon after adult eclosion. If the food supply is abundant, the female may start laying within about a week of mating, but if it is scarce, she may wait for up to nine months. Biology Convergent lady beetles adult aggregation The first larvae that hatch in each batch may start by eating the unhatched eggs. This may provide energy for the larvae before they find any aphids. Fourth-instar larvae may consume about fifty aphids per day and adults may eat about twenty. When aphids are scarce, the adults can eat honeydew, nectar and pollen or even petals and other soft parts of plants. However they must consume aphids in order to reproduce. In the western United States, these beetles may spend up to nine months in diapause in large aggregations in mountain valleys, far from their aphid food sources. In spring, the adults spread out and search for suitable sites to lay their eggs where aphids are plentiful. This dispersal trait is especially marked in this species as compared to other lady beetles. Biological control Convergent lady beetles are also used for augmentative biological control to temporarily increase predator numbers to control aphids. The species is available commercially in North America, but because of the overwintering habits of non- reproductive adults, released beetles tend to quickly disperse from their release site. Adults released in enclosed settings such as greenhouses can contribute to lower aphid numbers. Natural enemies Entomopathogenic fungi used as biopesticides such as Metarhizium anisopliae, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, and Beauveria bassiana can also infect larvae.

The parish was within the Metropolitan Police District and was part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, however it did not form part of the proposed Greater London area.Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London: 1957‚Äì1960: Report, 1960, HMSO The Hatfield Rural District was abolished in 1974 and the parish become part of the Welwyn Hatfield district. The parish was renamed Northaw and Cuffley in 1982. In 1994 there was a change to the boundary with Greater London when some land was gained from the London Borough of Enfield and the boundary became aligned to the M25 motorway. The parish was removed from the Metropolitan Police District in 2000. Following a successful petition by the district council, in 2005 Welwyn Hatfield became a borough and the district council became a borough council. Government The local council is Northaw and Cuffley Parish Council. The parish council offices are located on Maynard Place, Cuffley. Eight councillors are elected to the council. Northaw and Cuffley is a ward of the borough of Welwyn Hatfield and elects three councillors to Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council. For elections to Hertfordshire County Council, the parish is within the Hatfield Rural county division, which covers an area larger than the parish and elects one councillor. For elections to the European Parliament it is part of the East of England constituency. Although the rest of Welwyn Hatfield forms a constituency for elections to the UK Parliament, Northaw and Cuffley is instead part of the Broxbourne constituency. Geography The civil parish is located approximately north of central London and is adjacent to the Greater London boundary to the south. It is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and has large sections of protected open land. The parish includes the settlements of Northaw and Cuffley. For postal addresses, the parish is within the EN6 postcode district of the Potters Bar post town. Demography The parish had a population of 5,190 according to the 2001 census, most of whom live in Cuffley.

The Eel River Athabaskans include the Wailaki, Lassik, Nongatl, and Sinkyone (Sinkine) groups of Native Americans that traditionally live in present-day Mendocino, Trinity, and Humboldt counties on or near the Eel River and Van Duzen River of northwestern California. These groups speak dialects of the Wailaki language belonging to the Pacific Coast Athabaskan group of the Athapaskan language family which is prominently represented in Alaska, western Canada, and the southwestern U.S. Other related Athapaskan groups neighboring the Eel River Athapaskans included the Hupa-Whilkut-Chilula to the north, the Mattole on the coast to the west, and the Kato to the south. The Whilkut, Nongatl and Lassik were essentially annihilated during the Bald Hills War in the 1860s.  Eel River Athapaskan Tribes  = Nongatl = The Nongatl (Hupa word meaning ‚Ä≥Athapaskan to the south‚Ä≥) lived traditionally in the territory around the Van Duzen River, from its outlet on the Eel River to its headwaters near Dinsmore, California, and along Yager Creek and Larabee Creek (Elsasser 1978; Golla 2011). They had at least 35 villages.SOCIAL STUDIES FACT CARDS CALIFORNIA INDIANS - SOUTHERN ATHAPASKANS - Lassik, Mattole, Nongatl, Sinkyone, Wailaki Lucy Young, a Lassik woman = Lassik = The Lassik (Las'-sik, the name of their last chief) had about 20 villages and occupied a portion of main Eel River south to Kekawaka Creek, and its east tributaries, Van Duzen River, Larrabee, and Dobbyn creeks, as well the headwaters of the North Fork Eel River and Mad River. They had for neighbors toward the north the Whilkut inhabitants of the valley of Mad River and Redwood Creek; toward the east the Wintu of South Fork Trinity River; toward the south the Wailaki, from whom they were separated by Kekawaka Creek; toward the west the Sinkyone (Sinkine) on Southfork of Eel River. Their dialect resembles the Hupa in its morphology and the Wailaki in its phonology. The majority of them perished during the first few years of the occupancy of their country by white people, a bounty being placed on their heads and the traffic in children for slaves being profitable and unrestrained. A few families of them are still living in the neighborhood of their former homes. = Wailaki = The Wailaki (Wintun term meaning \\"north language.\\") or in their own language Kinist'ee (‚Ä≥the people‚Ä≥)California Athapascan Home Page - Basic Database Searching lived in northwestern California, along the Eel River south of Kekawaka Creek and the North Fork Eel River in three main subdivisions: Tsennahkenne or Tsen-nah-ken- ne (Eel River Wailaki or Mainstem Eel River band); Bahneko or Bah-ne-ko keah (North Fork [Eel River] Wailaki or North Fork Eel River band); and Che-teg- gah-ahng (Pitch Wailaki or Pitch band) (located farther up the North Fork of the Eel River).

Cook (1976) suggested a total of 4,700 for the Nongatl, Sinkyone, Lassik, Wailaki, Mattole, and Kato. Martin A. Baumhoff (1958) estimated the aboriginal populations as 2,325 for the Nongatl, 4,221 for the Sinkyone, 1,411 for the Lassik, and 2,760 for the Wailaki, or a total of 10,717 for the four Eel River Athapaskan groups. Kroeber estimated the combined population of the Nongatl, Sinkyone, and Lassik in 1910 as 100, and the population of the Wailaki as 200.

Enoch W. Frost began lumbering with a small portable sawmill as early as 1881 in the region around Texarkana. He expanded his operations and became associated with a group who formed the Frost-Trigg Lumber Company in 1897. In 1907, Edwin Ambrose Frost, son of Enoch, in conjunction with Clarence D. Johnson, organized the Frost-Johnson Lumber Company which merged with Frost-Trigg. The company was developed by E. A. into a complex lumber operation and was for a time the largest lumber manufacturer in Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana. Clarence D. Johnson, who was born in New York, came south and began his sawmill career working as a trimmer in a Louisiana mill in 1885. Johnson worked his way up through the mill and eventually became the first vice-president of the Frost-Johnson Lumber Company. In 1910 Frost-Johnson further expanded with the purchase of the Hayward mill and more than 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) of pinelands in Nacogdoches and adjoining counties, together with the Nacogdoches and Southeastern Railroad. Frost Johnson became Frost Lumber Industries in 1925 and three years later acquired another major Texas property with the purchase of the Waterman Lumber Company. With the death of E. A. Frost in 1950, the stockholders voted in 1952 to sell to Olin Industries who shortly thereafter sold to the International Paper Company.

Nyctography is a form of substitution cipher writing created by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1891. Nyctography is written with a nyctograph (also invented by Carroll) and uses a system of dots and strokes all based on a dot placed in the upper left corner. Using the Nyctograph, one could quickly jot down ideas or notes without the aid of light. Carroll invented the Nyctograph and Nyctography because he was often awakened during the night with thoughts that needed to be written down immediately, and didn't want to go through the lengthy process of lighting a lamp just to have to extinguish it shortly thereafter. Nyctograph The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen square holes, each a quarter inch wide, and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Carroll's design, which could then be transcribed the following day. He first named it \\"typhlograph\\", but at the suggestion of one of his brother-students, this was subsequently changed into \\"Nyctograph\\".‚ÄúThe Life And Letters Of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)‚Äù by Stuart Dodgson Collingwood B.A. Christ Church, Oxford Initially, Carroll used an oblong of card with an oblong cut out of the centre to guide his writing in the dark. This did not appear to be satisfactory as the results were illegible. The new and final version of the nyctograph is recorded in his journal of September 24, 1891, and is the subject of a letter to The Lady magazine of October 29, 1891: From the description it appears that Carroll‚Äôs nyctograph was a single row of 16 boxes cut from a piece of card. Carroll would enter one of his symbols in each box, then move the card down to the next line (which, in the darkness, probably, he would have to estimate) and then repeat the process. Nyctographic alphabet Lewis Carroll's nyctographic alphabet Each character had a large dot or circle in the upper- left corner. Beside the 26 letters of the alphabet, there were five additional characters for 'and', 'the', the corners of the letter 'f' to indicate that the following characters were digits ('figures'), the corners of the letter 'l' to indicate that they were letters, and the corners of the letter 'd' to indicate that the following six characters were a date in DDMMYY format. There was no capitalization, punctuation or digits per se, though modern font designers have created them (e.g. capitals may be double-scored, punctuation marks may have the large dot at the bottom right corner, digits at the bottom left). Numbers As in braille, letters were assigned to represent digits. The values were taken from his Memoria Technica, which assigned two consonants to each digit, with vowels unassigned, so that any number could be read off as a word. For nyctography, one of the consonants was used for each digit. Most are the initials of the numerals, as follows. (In brackets are the other values of the Memoria Technica, which apart from leftover j for 3 have their own motivations.) * 1 ‚Äì b (first consonant) [also c] * 2 ‚Äì d (for duo and deux) [also w of 'two'] * 3 ‚Äì t (for 'three') [also j] * 4 ‚Äì f (for 'four') [also q of quatre] * 5 ‚Äì l (roman numeral 50) [also v of 'five'] * 6 ‚Äì s (for 'six') [also x of 'six'] * 7 ‚Äì m (final of septem) [also p of septem] * 8 ‚Äì h (for huit) [also k] * 9 ‚Äì n (for 'nine') [also g] * 0 ‚Äì z (for 'zero') [also r of 'zero'] See also * Pigpen cipher * Night writing References External links * Alice's Adventures in Carroll's Own Square Alphabet ‚Äî Lewis Carroll Society of North America Category:History of technology Category:Works by Lewis Carroll Category:Writing systems ","title":"Nyctography"},{"id":"3898022","text":"Robert John Braidwood (29 July 1907 - 15 January 2003) was an American archaeologist and anthropologist, one of the founders of scientific archaeology, and a leader in the field of Near Eastern Prehistory. Life Braidwood was born July 29, 1907 in Detroit, Michigan, the first child of Walter John Braidwood (c1876) and Reay Nimmo (1881), and was educated at the University of Michigan, from where he graduated with an M.A. in architecture in 1933. Within a year he had joined the University of Chicago Oriental Institute's expedition to the Amuq Plain with the archaeologist James Henry Breasted. He worked with the expedition until 1938, during which time he married fellow Michigan graduate Linda Schreiber, who became his partner in the field and in his research. Braidwood spent World War II working for the Army Air Corps, in charge of a meteorological mapping program. In 1943 he gained his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, who immediately employed him, and at whose Oriental Institute and Department of Anthropology he was a professor until he retired. There is speculation that the fictional character Abner Ravenwood, from the Indiana Jones series, was based on Braidwood. Ravenwood was a fellow distinguished University of Chicago archaeologist known for his work in exotic locales and mentor to \\"Indy\\". Braidwood's colleague James Henry Breasted has been cited as a possible model for Indiana Jones Robert John Braidwood died January 15, 2003 in Chicago. His wife Linda died the same day. Work The expedition to the Amuq Plain (in the state of Hatay, Turkey) was one of the first scientific archaeological surveys, involving the rigorous dating of artifacts through careful mapping and record- keeping. In 1947, Braidwood had learned about carbon dating from his Chicago colleague Willard Libby, and he began to use the method in order to make his dating of artifacts more precise. Also in 1947 the Oriental Institute's Jarmo Project in Iraq was launched by Braidwood. It was an early example of an excavation aiming to retrieve evidence of the methods of early food production and to solve the ecological problem of its origin and early consequences. The project brought together archaeologists, biologists, and geologists in a ground-breaking study which earned it a National Science Foundation grant in 1954 -- one of the first times such an award had been made to an anthropological project. When the political situation in Iraq deteriorated, however, Braidwood was forced to leave, and he went on to carry out similar projects in Iran and Turkey. Together with researchers from Istanbul University, Braidwood worked at a site in southern Turkey called √áay√∂n√º, and provided extensive and significance evidence for the theory that between 8,000 and 12,000 years ago there was a shift from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural society in southern Turkey. In 1971 the Archaeological Institute of America awarded him the Gold Medal Award for distinguished archaeological achievement.

Five-reel features became common practice in the industry in 1915. During the silent era a one-reel short ran for an average of 10 minutes, and a two-reeler (usually a comedy) for 20 minutes, thus a feature was around 50 minutes or more.

In 1896‚Äì97 the club became founder members of the Dorset League, finishing in fifth place out of eight. They stayed there up and till the First World War when football was suspended in the Dorset league and returned to the League after the First World War in 1919‚Äì20 finishing fourth place out of nine.

The team continued to play in the Dorset League 1 but during the summer of 1924 an amalgamation took place between the club and Blandford Institute, who had been playing in Dorset League 2 to form the current club, Blandford United, with a reserve side in Division 2. In the 1934‚Äì35 season the club won the Dorset Senior Cup for the first time, beating Weymouth 2‚Äì1 after a drawn match. After the second world war the ground was unplayable owing to anti-tank traps, and they had to wait sometime before it could be used again. In 1957 the club left the Dorset league, to play in the Dorset Combination League which had just been created and the club won the Division 1 championship. They stayed in the league until 1964, having to leave due to a lack of players and money, but rejoined again in 1967 and two seasons later Blandford United won the league. The club then went on to win the league again in the 1974‚Äì75 and 1982‚Äì83 seasons, while also collecting a number of league cups during the 1970s.

It is likely to involve the element dol, meaning \\"water haugh, meadow\\". The second element may be equivalent to the Welsh gwas meaning \\"an abode\\". Community Dallas is known locally as having a good community spirit. It holds an ambitious village Gala every July in which local girls are picked to be the Gala Queen and her attendants. The village will hold events daily including a games day which involves an race through the village in wheelbarrows or prams followed by \\"It's a knockout\\" style team games. The gala is a bigger event than might be expected for such a small village, and attracts many visitors from surrounding areas. Features There is a lot of forestry in this region. The gardens of Dallas Lodge are often open to the public. The Church of St. Michael in the village dates from 1793, but is built on the site of an earlier church known from records to have been in existence in 1226.

USS Camanche c. 1866. USS Camanche was a monitor that was prefabricated at Jersey City, New Jersey by Donahue, Ryan and Secor for the sum of 613,164.98 dollars ($ in present day terms). She was disassembled and shipped around Cape Horn in the sailing ship Aquila to San Francisco, California. Aquila arrived in San Francisco on 10 November 1863 but sank at her wharf in 30 feet of water on 14 November 1863 as a result of storm damage and a collision with another ship. The monitor's parts were salvaged and she was launched on 14 November 1864. Camanche was commissioned in May 1865, Lieutenant Commander Charles J. McDougal in command. Commissioned just after the end of the Civil War, for more than a year‚Äîuntil the arrival of the larger monitor ‚ÄîCamanche was the only U.S. ironclad on the Pacific coast, and she was one of but two stationed there for nearly 25 years. Camanches career was a quiet one, with the ship generally maintained in decommissioned status at the Mare Island Navy Yard, in northern San Francisco Bay. She was the California Naval Militia's training ship in 1896‚Äì97 and appears to have been reactivated for a few months in 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, for coastal defense purposes. Camanche was sold on 22 March 1899 for the sum of 6,581.25 dollars. According to page 10 of the San Francisco Call dated November 20, 1899, Camanche had her machinery, her weapons and her armor removed by the Union Iron Works in Oakland and she was converted into a collier, hauling coal. Her first voyage as a collier occurred on November 19, 1899. Photographic evidence and local records indicate she remained in the San Francisco area hauling coal for almost 40 years after that. On March 5, 1937 a California newspaper the \\"Sausalito News\\" reported on the old monitors fate: \\"....So the old craft lay at her old home until a local coal concern brought her for a song, and converted her into a coal barge. She did duty until oil and gas took the place of coal and is now lying at the east end of the Bethlehem shipyard, a useless forgotten hulk. Her contract price was $400,000.00\\".

History  Notre Dame High School was founded in 1946 by the Congregation of Holy Cross, the same religious institute that established the University of Notre Dame. The school's name derives from the French Notre Dame, meaning \\"Our Lady\\". Situated on a hill, the school originally comprised several buildings, one of which is Harugari Hall (now in the possession of the neighboring University of New Haven). Announced in 2007, the new 28,000-square-foot Arts, Technology, and Spiritual Center was officially opened for the 2012-13 academic school year. On September 16, 2012, Reverend Henry J. Mansell, Archbishop of Hartford presided over the blessing and dedication of this addition, which houses the Saint Brother Andr√© Bessette Chapel, the Maureen and George Collins ‚Äô58 Auditorium, an enhanced Music Room (which includes practice rooms and a technology room),a new Library and Media Center, and a Technology Classroom. In 2014, Notre Dame High School began raising funds for the \\"Field of Dreams\\" project, which aimed to create new football practice fields and renovate the outdoor track.  Administration and academics  Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford, Notre Dame is operated independently by the Congregation of Holy Cross. The school is run day-to-day on a Headmaster-Principal model. Notre Dame draws a diverse student body from across the New Haven County area and beyond. Its sister school is Sacred Heart Academy, located in Hamden, Connecticut. The teaching faculty is composed predominantly of laypeople, though there are still a handful of Brothers. Both \\"extended study\\" and \\"semester at college\\" programs are available to qualified students during their senior year.  Athletics  Known as the \\"Green Knights,\\" Notre Dame High School's athletes boast a rich tradition of success with notable football, ice hockey, baseball, golf, basketball, swim and track programs. The school also competes in wrestling, lacrosse, and most recently, crew. Notre Dame is a member of the Southern Connecticut Conference.

It was included in the musical play, Great Day. The play only ran for 36 performances but contained two songs which became famous, \\"Without a Song\\" and \\"Great Day\\". Background and initial recordings Canadian singer, Gilbert Burgess Holland introduced ‚ÄúWithout A Song‚Äù in the show ‚ÄúGreat Day‚Äù accompanied by Fletcher Henderson‚Äôs Orchestra, in the pit of the famous Park Theatre, NYC. https://archive.org/stream/RecordResearch37/RR%2037_djvu.txt Gilbert is the son of Reverend John Christie Holland. One of the earliest recordings of the song was by Paul Whiteman's orchestra featuring Bing Crosby on October 9, 1929 and this reached the charts of the day. \\"Without a Song\\" was recorded in March 1946 in New York by Billy Eckstine,Billy Eckstine, I Ain't Like That, Quadromania, Jazz Edition, 4CD, Mebran International GmbH, 2005 who later rerecorded the song live on 30 August 1960 at the Cloud Nine Lounge of the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas for his album No Cover, No Minimum. \\"Without a Song\\" also was recorded twice by Perry Como: the first time on January 11, 1951 and the second time in June 1970 at a live performance at the International Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. The 1951 recording was issued as a 78 rpm single in the United States by RCA Victor Records (catalog number 20-4033) and in the United Kingdom by HMV (catalog number B-10093). It was also included in a 1957 album, Dream Along With Me (RCA Camden catalog number CAL-403). The 1970 recording was issued on albums by RCA and its United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Japan subsidiaries, but not as a single. Other notable recordings Lawrence Tibbett, Nelson Eddy and Frank Sinatra recorded versions of the song with what appears to be the original lyrics, including the line, \\"A darkie's born, but he's no good no how, without a song.\\" In subsequent recordings, Sinatra didn't use the term \\"darkie\\", and later recorded versions included the altered text \\"a man is born, but he's no good no how, without a song.\\" The original was played in error on BBC Radio 4's 'PM' program on the 9th April 2020, prompting an apology on the same program four days later. In addition to popular artists like Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Keely Smith and Neil Sedaka, and opera singers like Lauritz Melchior, Jan Peerce and Mario Lanza, many African-American artists of varying styles also successfully recorded the song after Billy Eckstine first did so in 1946, including a version in \\"gospel style\\" by Mahalia Jackson in concert in Berlin, 1967; also versions by George Benson, The Ravens, The Isley Brothers, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes (for their album I Hear A Symphony), and jazz singer Jimmy Scott on his 2006 album Milestone Profiles - Jimmy Scott on Milestone Records.

It loses the name at the Parclo interchange with SR 24. The route continues south as The Beltline. It passes by a Martin's‚Äîa clothing chain known also known as Wakefield's in Oxford; this store chain is only in Alabama‚Äîand continues southeast to the Decatur Mall. It continues east across a railroad bridge to US 31. The majority of this stretch is four-laned to six-laned. It continues southeast to Priceville, where it passes by a Publix supermarket‚Äîthe second one along the route‚Äîand continues to another strip of restaurants and gas stations, junctioning with I-65‚Äîwhere it loses The Beltline name and continuing to a FoodLand supermarket. About half of a mile later, the route loses two lanes and climbs up a hill and exits Priceville a few miles later. The route continues for about five miles to Somerville. It then passes by a post office and then continues onward to another part of Somerville‚Äîreferred to by some as Pence‚Äîwhere it passes by a Jack's and junctions with SR 36. Immediately after this junction is mile marker 24. The route continues for about four miles to Brewer, just north of Eva. it continues onward through slightly hilly terrain until it gains a lane southbound and climbs up another hill into Hulaco. It eventually crosses into Cullman County. It then junctions with SR 69 in Baileyton. It passes through hilly terrain to the Blount County line. It then continues south and gradually turns east again and junctions with US 231 almost directly above its US 231's junction with US 278. This is SR 67's southern terminus. Future Over time, The Beltline currently has its own traffic problem and provided ample space for large businesses with interest in Decatur. Plans are underway to widen The Beltline from its current size of four lanes to six lanes to help move traffic along more smoothly. One of the businesses that has contributed to congestion is the Decatur Mall, the only mall in the Decatur metropolitan area.

The books are all set in the world of Illmoor, a fictional continent. The first book, The Ratastrophe Catastrophe was released in June 2003. The latest book is The Coldstone Conflict. Books The Illmooor Chronicles consists of six books: The Ratastrophe Catastrophe, The Yowler Fowl-Up, The Shadewell Shenanigans, The Dwellings Debacle, The Vanquish Vendetta, and The Coldstone Conflict. David Lee Stone is not currently working on an Illmoor Seven, as he is working on a new project called Davey Swag. =The Ratastrophe Catastrophe= The Ratastrophe Catastrophe was released in June 2003. The Ratastrophe Catastrophe is the first book The Illmoor Chronicles. In the book, a simple young boy named Diek Wustapha, who becomes possessed by dark magic early in the story and finds that he has the power to charm people and animals alike with the tune of his flute. Soon becoming bored of his life in the town of Little Irkesome, Diek journeys around Illmoor, looking for a use for his newly acquired talents. In Dullitch, capital city of Illmoor, the current ruler, Duke Modeset, is facing a severe problem. The city is infested with rats, large rats, and lots of them, too. The resident rat-catchers have long since given up, and the situation is grave. The chairman of the Dullitch Council, Tambor Forestall, who was a wizard before he gave up magic for politics when sorcery was outlawed on Illmoor long ago, has sent heralds to hire mercenaries to solve the Dullitch rat infestation. One of the heralds, young Jimmy Quickstint, grandson of Tambor, who only works as a herald part-time; he is actually a trainee member of the Rooftop Runners, a group of organised thieves in Dullitch, finds the barbarian mercenaries Groan Teethgrit, the giant, bald mountain of muscle, and Gordo Goldeaxe, a one-eyed dwarf equipped with a lethal axe and an even deadlier supply of sarcasm. After being informed that all the other mercenaries on the list are dead or dismembered, Jimmy heads back to Dullitch with the intrepid barbarian pair, who completely fail to solve the rat problem. Meanwhile, another herald stumbles upon Diek in the town of Crust, and promptly puts his name on the list and brings him back to Dullitch. Once there, Diek convinces Duke Modeset that he is able to get rid of the rat infestation for a price far lower than what the Duke was planning to pay the barbarians. Parodying the Pied Piper, Diek charms the rats with his flute and leads them to a nearby jetty and drowns them all. As he goes to collect his reward from the Duke, he finds that the Dullitch Treasury lacks the funds to pay him. Enraged, he leaves the Treasury and is convinced by a voice in his head- the magic possessing him‚Äì that he should have his revenge on all of Dullitch. He then charms the city's children in the same way. The citizens of Dullitch, bewildered at the sudden disappearance of the children of the city, decide that Duke Modeset is a good scapegoat. They surround the palace, trapping him inside, but not before he gives Jimmy Quickstint a couple of hundred crowns down-payment to give to the barbarian mercenaries, as well as Tambor, who has joined the pair and returned to his sorcerer roots, to bring the children of Dullitch back and kill Diek. Unfortunately, the horse Jimmy is riding runs off with the money and he is stuck in the middle of the Carafat Jungles, but soon finds a secret entrance to the catacombs of the mountains known as the Twelve, where he meets a stranger named Stump, who claims to have seen Diek come into the catacombs with the children. Jimmy and Stump travel further into the Twelve, where they meet Tambor, Groan and Gordo, who have also found their way into the Twelve as they were held prisoner by an angry giant. The group, motivated by the prospect of saving the children of Dullitch from Diek, as well as by the prospect of money, decide to attack Diek, whose mind has been totally consumed by dark magic, when they find him deep in the Twelve. In the battle that follows, Tambor opens a portal known as the Doorway of Death, a way into the limbo, as Groan distracts Diek. Unfortunately, Diek manages to push Tambor into his own Doorway, and as a furious Groan hurls Diek bodily into the portal, the Doorway of Death closes, sealing their fates. Meanwhile, as Jimmy and Gordo manage to free the children from their prison, Stump falls into a hole and disappears. The remaining three lead the children safely back to Dullitch, where they are rewarded in separate ways. Groan and Gordo are drugged and thrown into jail, and Jimmy is kicked out of the Rooftop Runners for being brave and honourable. Duke Modeset is exiled from Dullitch, and his cousin, Viscount Raviss Curfew, is to be the next lord of Dullitch. =The Yowler Fowl-up= A terrible sect has arisen in Illmoor - they're dark, they're deadly and they're even more hellbent on the destruction of the city than the citizens themselves. All that stands between total chaos and the return of the dark gods are Duke Modeset (who doesn't like the place anyway), Jareth Obegarde (a vampire on his mother's side) and Jimmy Quickstint (who is about to do the wrong favour for the wrong man). A thrilling story of darkness and destiny, where the brave step forward...and fall over. -Blurb on back cover. \\"sublime humour...wonderfully tongue in cheek...\\" (Manchester Evening News) =The Shadewell Shenanigans= The Shadewell Shenanigans was released on 5 June 2005. This book is centered around the characters of Groan Teethgrit, a barbarian, his partner in crime Gordo Goldeaxe, a dwarf, and his half brother Gape, who first appears in this book. Gordo and Groan are notorious criminals well known for looting banks of Illmoor. The lords of the great cities of Illmoor need to devise a plan to get rid of Groan, Gape and Gordo, but cannot do so openly as the duo are also known and admired for saving the children of Dullitch from the clutches of an evil sorcerer during the events of the first Illmoor book, The Ratastrophe Catastrophe. Having no other choice, the lords of Illmoor turn to Duke Vandre Modeset, disgraced noble and exiled Lord of Dullitch, ruler of his ancestral town of Fogrise, for help against the notorious criminals. Modeset reveals his elaborate plan to use the princess of Phlegm, Susti as bait to lure the trio to their deaths. King Phew of Phlegm then publicly announces that he will be holding a tournament to choose a husband for Susti, who is far from happy about the role she is playing in Modeset's scheme. Groan and Gape, unable to resist the lure of riches and a beautiful woman, enter the competition. They both get an audience with the princess for a night each, and then compete in the arena by killing goblins, trolls and the like. This ends in a draw. Eventually, Princess Susti makes a speech, stating that the brothers must prove their devotion to her by obtaining four priceless items, namely, the Idol of Needs on Kazbrack, an island off the east coast of Illmoor inhabited by fire demons, Ezra's Opal, which belongs to Lady Khan, wife of Mad Count Craven, the zombie ruler of Wemeru the undead city in the voodoo jungles of Rintintetly, Pagoda's Box, a treasure chest in the Finion Finger Mountains guarded day and night by harpies, and the jewelled eyes of Torche, a giant dragon in the Fastrush Pass. These legendary items are, in fact, non-existent, made up by Modeset. However, the dangers that each of the four places possess are all too real. The three clueless adventurers decide to work together. They decide to travel to the nearest location, Wemeru, to find Ezra's Opal. They arrive at an inn, where they try to rent a carriage and end up fighting and knocking out a gangster named Loogie Lambontroff, who is the nephew of Count Craven. They decide to take him along, in case he is useful in the future. When Loogie wakes, it is revealed that he is a twinling, which means that when he is angry, he morphs into a dangerous and murderous version of himself. Two fights with Loogie end up with the gangster getting decapitated. The trio are even more shocked when Loogie's severed head speaks and informs them that since he is a zombie by birth, his head is still sentient. Meanwhile, Princess Susti has discovered Modeset's dastardly plot to trap and kill the Teethgrit brothers and sets out to warn them of their impending doom. However, Modeset catches up to her and captures her. When he arrives back at Phlegm, he makes a drastic decision and takes over Phlegm with the soldiers of the city, who have no loyalty to King Phew whatsoever. Modeset doesn't realise that Stump, a character from the first Illmoor book, has been eavesdropping on the whole situation and has left to tell Groan and Gape. Loogie tells the group that Lady Khan was stolen from him by his uncle Craven, and that Lady Khan is actually a chicken, and finds the idea that she owns Ezra's Opal absurd. Nevertheless, they storm the city of Wemeru and fend off the zombie hordes while Loogie, angered at the sight of his uncle, transforms into the twinling, and strangles the Count. After confirming that Lady Khan is indeed a zombie chicken, Loogie, who used to be a geography student, asks about the other three artifacts and says that he has never heard of the items. Gordo feels that they have been tricked, but Groan and Gape suggest checking Kazbrack, the next nearest location, for the Idol of Needs. They find a flying machine in the central pyramid of Wemeru and Loogie tells them how to operate the device. They fly to Kazbrack, but are viciously shot at by fire demons. They retreat quickly and crash into the River Washin, but not before Gape is burned by a fire demon. They then find Stump, who recognises Groan and Gordo from their adventures together in The Ratastrophe Catastrophe and tells them about Modeset and his plan. Enraged at being tricked and still angry about being imprisoned by Modeset, they march back to Phlegm, but on the way are attacked by three of Loogie's gangster bosses on a barge, who have heard that Loogie was knocked unconscious by the barbarian brothers. One of them shoots Stump in the shoulder and swim ashore to fight the rest of them. After a tough battle, the gangsters, Mr Big, Mr Mediocre and Mr Titch, are defeated, and the group now have access to the weapons and armour available on the barge before attacking Phlegm. As Groan, Gordo and Gape attack the doors of Phlegm, Stump, who has recovered from his shoulder wound, helps out from afar as he is good with a bow and arrow, with Loogie acting as his second pair of eyes. When the doors of Phlegm are breached, the terrified Phlegmian soldiers immediately surrender and they rush up onto the wall, where Modeset is confronted by King Phew and Princess Susti, who have escaped from the dungeons with the help of Modeset's manservant Pegrand Marshall, who has fallen for Susti. Weapons are drawn and pointed at each other, with Modeset pointing a gun at Groan and his raised broadsword, and Gape's twin swords poised to strike General Crikey, leader of the Phlegmian soldiers who has a crossbow. Groan agrees to lower his sword, but Modeset thinks better of it and shoots him twice. The first shot rebounds off Groan's metal collar and hits Modeset in the face, knocking him into Phlegm Keep's shark-infested moat. The second shot hits his thigh, knocking him out. Gape, seeing this, hurls both swords at Crikey, killing him. Meanwhile, outside the Keep, Stump has fallen into a hole, just as he has done twice before, taking Loogie with him. On the wall of the Keep, Susti suggests a way to end the conflict without any other blood being spilled and offers to make Groan the King of Phlegm. Groan and Phew both agree and Groan becomes King, Gordo becomes the new chief of the Phlegmian guard and Gape becomes Phlegm's chief of trade. King Groan and Pegrand, the new Duke of Fogrise, meet up with the other lords of Illmoor and state that Phlegm is withdrawing from the Great Assembly. The story ends mysteriously as Modeset's body is not found in the moat, and he previously mentions to Pegrand having swum in his father's shark-infested lagoon as a boy without being attacked by the creatures. His funeral is held a year later, and King Groan's first son is born during this time. =The Dwellings Debacle= A dark enemy is about to make its presence felt in Dullitch...something even more twisted and evil than the citizens themselves. But for Enoch Dwellings, famed investigator, it's a golden opportunity to shine. Unfortunately, the vampire detective next door has the same idea, and he never bites off more than he can chew. There may be trouble ahead... =The Vanquish Vendetta= An evil impostor sits on the Dullitch throne, posing as Viscount Curfew. With bodies dropping left and right, suspicions are aroused. But it's nothing the Royal Society of Lantern Collectors can't handle... Meanwhile, King Groan Teethgrit is broke. A plan to flog an ancient hammer leads him, his brother and Gordo Goldaxe back to Dullitch, where once again, they help make a bad situation so much worse. =The Coldstone Conflict= The evil Vanquish has returned to Illmoor and none can stand against him. To make matters worse, Illmoor's greatest hero is now a walking, talking, killing vessel of darkness. With two of the continent's other greatest heroes dead and only a pitiful band of crusaders fighting for freedom Hope is fading fast... And yet there is one - ancient and powerful enough to challenge the dark god - who might step up to the task. Unfortunately, he's only interested in staying forgotten. Can Illmoor unite to face its greatest enemy yet?

Players take on the part of a contemporary human fighter pilot abducted by the alien Repton species during an aerial battle, and biologically modified to become a starfighter pilot for them in their war against the Evil Ovon race. Gameplay The player pilots one of three different starfighters, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and occasionally a captured enemy ship, or controlling a gun turret on the Mothership (The \\"War Drum\\"). The missions include simple combat, defending the mothership, destroying an enemy Ovon mothership, clearing an asteroid field, and retrieving an object with a tractor beam. The player's ship moves between mission areas via \\"hyperspace portals\\", passing through a hyper-space environment, resembling that seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often during hyperspace transit, varying streams of energy are encountered; gold energy replenishes the energy which fuels the ship, while blue energy drains it, reducing the ship's effectiveness. Darklight Conflict has several multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, team battles, and space combat variations of tag and capture the flag. Story After the player character completes the four campaigns and destroys the Ovon home-world for the Reptons, the Reptons send their best pilots to kill the player character. The player character escapes and jumps to Earth, where centuries have passed since the player character left. The ship is greeted by the Earth Defense Fleet, which destroys all Repton ships in hot pursuit. Reception Reviewing the PC version in GameSpot, Greg Kasavin commented, \\"Darklight Conflict packs a lot of action between its campaign, arcade, and six-player network modes, so it'll keep you occupied for a long, long time. And you can bet you'll be gawking at its visuals all the while.\\" He lauded the peripheral vision afforded by the game's letterboxed display, the high frame rate, the special weapons, the targeting system, the quantity and variety of missions, the sleek rendering of the spaceships, the explosion and lighting effects, and the moody soundtrack. He considered the absence of licensing to be the only flaw, saying the unfamiliarity of the spacecraft makes them harder to get used to and less immediately appealing. The console versions received a mix of critical reactions, with the one commonality being praise for the lighting effects. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Dan Hsu and Next Generation said the graphics in general are superior to those of the game's closest competitor, the PlayStation version of Wing Commander IV, though the Next Generation reviewer added that they still come as a disappointment compared to the PC version of Darklight Conflict. He and EGMs Crispin Boyer and Sushi-X found the oversensitive controls with no support for analog controllers to be an annoyance which greatly aggravates the already frustrating difficulty; Boyer elaborated that \\"you're forced to tap, tap, tap until you're on target.\\" GamePro, however, contended that \\"The control is a bit twitchy at first, but is very solid once you get used to it.\\" Critics also disagreed about the game's lack of story. Both Sushi-X and Jeff Gerstmann praised this element as enabling better enjoyment of the gameplay, and characterized Wing Commander IVs extensive cutscenes as fluff, while Dan Hsu and Next Generation both felt it hurt the game. Next Generation reasoned, \\"As excessive and ungameplay- focused as the FMV sequences in Wing Commander IV are, at least they give the player a face to identify with, and maybe even an emotional connection. Darklight Conflicts generic polygonal spaceships offer nothing to involve even the most hyperimaginative.\\" Critics differed most sharply over the quality of the missions. Boyer, Hsu, and Next Generation all argued that despite the varying objectives, the missions all boil down to the same requisite skills, making for an extremely repetitive gaming experience. In contrast, GamePro and Sega Saturn Magazine praised the variety afforded by the missions, with SSM adding that \\"the action continues all the way through with some complex and well designed duties\\".

Origin of the name The Queen Victoria Jubilee Clock at the foot of Lauriston Place The area lies on an old drovers' road coming into Edinburgh from West Lothian. All indication is that the name, as now used, has drifted southwards and south-westwards from the area to which it originally pertained. The name is presumed to derive from a crossroads where toll payments were collected from travellers entering the city, but the junction did not exist until modern times. In the 18th century a toll, appearing on maps as the Twopenny Custom, existed at present-day Main Point, at the top of the slope emerging from the Grassmarket where three centuries-old routes into the town from the West converged.D Easton (ed.), By The Three Great Roads, Aberdeen 1988 The custom, introduced in 1680, was a tax on every pint of ale and beer brewed outside the town walls. Main Point may therefore have been the original \\"tollcross\\", the name being transferred from the street known today as High Riggs to the modern junction some time after Lothian Road was laid in 1785 (see The Strangers Guide map of 1805 showing the area before Lothian Road was extended; and the Stevenson Map of 1837 showing the name's migration to the southern end of the street). A milestone opposite Merchiston Castle in Colinton Road marked \\"1 mile from Tollcross\\" has clearly been measured from Main Point rather than the modern junction. The other toll in the area, dating from 1792, in consequence of the 1755 Turnpike Act, was at the village of Wrightshouses, on the Wester Hiegait to Biggar (now Bruntsfield Place), roughly where the Barclay Church now stands. Its existence was recalled until recently in the name of the Auld Toll public house on the opposite side of the road before the pub was renamed in 2012. However, the earliest reference to Tollcross dates from 1439. The names tolcors, towcroce, tolcroce appear on 16th century maps, taking the form towcorse as late as 1787. It has been suggested that cros is a later form of cors (as in Old Welsh toll cors, meaning a boggy hollow) and that the ending -corse would have aptly described the low-lying area beside the now culverted Lochrin Burn running between the slopes of the Burgh Muir and the High Riggs south of the Grassmarket.S Harris, The Place Names of Edinburgh, London 2002 Etymologically however this makes no sense, as the historic maps show the original settlement confined to the high ground at High Riggs. The closest \\"boggy hollow\\" was 1km to the north, just west of the Nor' Loch. Physical description Close-up of the Tollcross clock The junction is formed by Earl Grey Street (an extension of Lothian Road originally named Wellington Street) to the north, Lauriston Place to the east, Brougham Street to the south-east (leading to Melville Drive which cuts through The Meadows), Home Street to the south (which leads to Bruntsfield), and West Tollcross to the west. In the middle of the junction is a distinctive ironwork pillar clock which has been one of the city's landmarks since 1901. Many Victorian and Edwardian photographs feature the clock at what was a busy tram hub. It was gifted to the city by Provost James Steel and Treasurer Robert Cranston, and was one of four similar clocks made by the Edinburgh clockmakers, James Ritchie & Son. The skeleton face and pillar were made by Macfarlane Castings. Originally a weight-driven pendulum clock, it was altered to a spring-driven mechanism in 1926. It and the clock at the city's West End were the largest street clocks in Britain to be driven by this type of mechanism. It was wound weekly by a clockwinder employed by Ritchie's, using a crank handle inserted into the base. In 1969, it was converted to an electric mechanism located between the dials. Junction improvements in 1974 led to the clock's removal, causing public consternation, as a result of which it was returned to a spot close to its original position. The southern edge of the area merges with Bruntsfield while to the north and west Tollcross joins Fountainbridge. Lauriston and the rest of the Old Town lie to the East. Amenities The area is diverse, with a considerable number of eateries including Indian, Chinese, Thai, French, Spanish and Greek restaurants, Turkish kebab shops, a Sushi bar, Japanese bistro and two traditional fish and chip shops. There is a cluster of services here for the city's Chinese community including a Chinese-language church, two Chinese supermarkets, a travel agent, health store, support centre for the elderly and barber shop. Tollcross Primary School includes the city's Scottish Gaelic-Medium Unit. The area has many local provision shops including a butcher, greengrocer, bakeries (traditional, Italian and Polish), a supermarket, two mini-supermarkets, five foodstores, one specialising in Oriental foods, and a wine shop. There are two banks, a post office, two bookmakers, seven hairdressers, five clothes shops including two Indian boutiques, a Hindi video store, two clothes alteration shops, four estate agents, three beauty parlours, three jewellers, a bicycle shop, florist, electrical goods shop, art shop, hi-fi retailer, second-hand records shop, musical instruments repairer, tattoo parlour, laundrette and dry-cleaner's. There are around 10 caf√©s, including an internet caf√©, four newsagents and several charity shops. The area has eight pubs. Pitch and Putt on Bruntsfield Links The King's Theatre and The Cameo cinema are located on Leven Street and Home Street respectively. There is a modern health centre, two dental clinics, two pharmacies, an optician's, a homeopathic medicines shop, an orthodontist and a chiropractor. Princes Exchange, a large new office development (circa 2000) and home to the Corporate arm of the Bank of Scotland, occupies a central position on Earl Grey Street. The area has its own fire station. The Meadows and Bruntsfield Links are public parks which skirt Tollcross to the east and south, with a children's playpark in each, and, respectively, municipal tennis courts and a 'pitch and putt' course. The Links are claimed to be one of the earliest places where golf was played in Scotland. Town Council Minutes refer to a 'Golfhall' tavern on the Links dating from 1717, and the Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society of Edinburgh, which still exists, was founded in 1761 (see Bruntsfield Links for more references to golf on the Links).W Bryce Moir, The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, vol.x, 1918, pp.243-4 Housing Early 19thC tenements on the east side of Home Street Housing is mainly in the form of Victorian tenement flats, with a few, later, Dunn & Findlay blocks listed as being of significant local architectural or historical interest. Some buildings from the old village of Wrychtishousis still stand on the west side of Leven Street; others surviving until recently next to the Golf Tavern were replaced in the 1990s by a block of student flats. The unprepossessing four-storey tenements on the east side of Home Street were designed by the eminent New Town architect James Gillespie Graham to provide 'room-and-kitchen' accommodation for poorer families. They were built on land feued from the owner of Drumdryan House (renamed Leven Lodge by an 18thC owner Lord Leven) which once stood on the site of the King's Theatre. Later owners of the house were the Home-Rigg family who owned Tarvit House in Fife, hence the names of Home Street and Tarvit Street. A later villa, also named Drumdryan House, became enclosed by the surrounding tenements of Home Street and Drumdryan Street before being demolished in 1959. Other early buildings are the residential properties in Gilmore Place, named after Samuel Gilmour, owner of a ropeworks which formerly stood here. Most of the area's housing was put up in the 1860s and 1870s by James Steel, an entrepreneurial Edinburgh builder who was responsible for many \\"working-class tenement developments\\"Rodger, Richard. The Transformation of Edinburgh: Land, Property and Trust in the Nineteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 2004. in various parts of the city; others were the work of small local building associations. Many students live in the area where Napier University has three separate halls of residence. Churches The Church of Scotland parish churches for Tollcross are Barclay Viewforth Church, which dominates views at the southern edge, and St Cuthbert's Church at the northern end of Lothian Road. Central Hall, a category B-listed building by Dunn & Findlay, is owned by the Methodist Church since 1901, was purchased by Morningside Baptist Church in June 2011. The church uses it for worship services, offices and other activities. At the end of September 2012, its name was changed to Central. The Scottish Episcopal Church is St Michael's and All Saints Church in Brougham Street. The nearest Roman Catholic church is the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart, served by the Society of Jesus, in Lauriston Street, just beyond Tollcross in the neighbouring district of Lauriston. A convent of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Gilmore Place incorporates a care home. Transport and industry The Lochrin area in 1831, showing the brewery, distillery, canal basin, ropeworks and toll (lower right) Tollcross, like neighbouring Fountainbridge, was important to the city's industry in the 19th century after the nearby Union Canal, completed in 1822, stimulated economic growth in the surrounding area. The tenement block called Lochrin Buildings perpetuates the name of the small Lochrin Burn (Scots for stream) which ran from the Burgh Loch in the Meadows to the Water of Leith at Roseburn. The site was formerly occupied by Lochrin House and the Lochrin Distillery which was replaced in 1859 by the Lochrin Iron Works, both benefiting from being situated directly beside one of the canal basins. Like the distillery, the Drumdryan Brewery, which stood on the site now occupied by the King's Theatre (1906), drew water from the burn which, now culverted, still flows under the building. There was also a saw mill, paraffin works, and municipal slaughterhouse in West Tollcross. In 1899 the tram depot and power station for the southern section of Edinburgh's large cable tramway system (later electric) opened here. After the last tram ran in 1956 it became a bus garage. This was demolished in 1967 to make way for a new fire station in 1998 which replaced the central fire station in Lauriston Place. The area is well served by Lothian Buses, route numbers 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 24, 27 & 45\\\\. Tollcross Primary School and Fire Station Notable residents * Angus Calder References Further reading * D.

In the original Broadway production it was introduced by John Hundley and Lillian Taiz. The following year, it was sung by Lawrence Gray in the Hollywood musical version of that show by Bernice Claire and Frank Albertson. The most popular recording of the song in 1929 was by Leo Reisman. Other film appearances In 1933, it was included in a two-reel version of the film re-titled Yours Sincerely, part of the Broadway Brevities series, starring Lanny Ross. In the 1944 Hollywood musical This Is the Life, it was sung by Donald O'Connor and Susanna Foster. It was included in the 1948 musical film, Words and Music, a biography of Rodgers and Hart, where it was sung by Perry Como. A notable version of the song features in Michael Curtiz's 1950 Hollywood musical biographical drama Young Man with a Horn, performed by the film's star Doris Day with iconic trumpeter Harry James and His Orchestra. In the 1951 Hollywood musical Painting the Clouds with Sunshine it was sung by Dennis Morgan and Lucille Norman. It was the title song in the 1952 Hollywood musical With a Song in My Heart, a biographical movie about Jane Froman, in which it was sung by Froman on the soundtrack for Susan Hayward. In the 1953 science fiction classic The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms the song is playing in the background while Tom Nesbitt is trying to identify the beast he saw from sketches of prehistoric creatures. Notable recordings A recording with Perry Como, sung with choir and orchestra conducted by Henri Ren√©, was made in New York City on December 23, 1948. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3329 (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number BD 1230. Arild Andresen, piano with guitar and bass recorded it in Oslo on March 11, 1955 as the second melody of the medley \\"Klaver-Cocktail Nr. 3\\" along with \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" and \\"Flamingo\\".

It appears to be responsible for the burning sensation that occurs in the back of the throat when consuming such oil. Oleocanthal is a tyrosol ester and its chemical structure is related to oleuropein, also found in olive oil. Potential biological effects = Anti-inflammatory = Oleocanthal has been found to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in vitro. Similar to classical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). 50 g (more than three and a half tablespoons) of a typical extra virgin olive oil per day contains an amount of oleocanthal with similar in vitro anti- inflammatory effect as 1/10 of the adult ibuprofen dose. It is therefore suggested that long-term consumption of small quantities may be responsible in part for the low incidence of heart disease and Alzheimer's disease associated with a Mediterranean diet. However, 50 g is a great deal of olive oil for most consumers; moreover, the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of oleocanthal is not well characterized, and it is not known whether these in vitro effects actually occur in the body. \\"Against this background, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of dietary oleocanthal cannot be as relevant as hypothesized by Beauchamp et al.\\" Oleocanthal is an activator of the TRPA1 ion channel, which is activated by ibuprofen. Oleocanthal is found to be responsible for the burning sensation when consuming extra-virgin olive oil. Recently it has been demonstrated that oleocanthal shows potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of inflammatory degenerative joint diseases. Oleocanthal inhibits LPS-induced NO production in J774 macrophages, without affecting cell viability. Moreover, it inhibits MIP-1Œ± and IL-6 mRNA expression, as well as protein synthesis, in both ATDC5 chondrocytes and J774 macrophages. Oleocanthal also inhibits IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ± and GM-CSF protein synthesis from LPS-stimulated macrophages. = Beta-amyloid = Studies in an animal model suggest that oleocanthal can reduce the accumulation of Œ≤-amyloid proteins via up-regulation of P-glycoprotein and LRP1. = Selective cytotoxicity= Oleocanthal is capable of killing a variety of human cancer cells in vitro while leaving healthy cells unharmed. While apoptosis requires between 16 and 24 hours, oleocanthal operated within 30 minutes to one hour. Oleocanthal pierces cancer cells' lysosomes, the containers that store the cell's waste products, releasing enzymes that kill the cell. In healthy cells, the application of oleocanthal caused a temporary halt in their life cycles, but after 24 hours they returned to normal. Oleocanthal inhibits the enzymatic activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with an IC50 value of 708 nM. Oleocanthal inhibits the growth of several breast cancer cell lines at low micromolar concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Oleocanthal treatment caused a marked downregulation of phosphorylated mTOR in metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). These results strongly indicate that mTOR inhibition is at least one of the factors of the reported anticancer and neuroprotective properties of oleocanthal. Cell apoptosis is tested by treating the lysosomal membrane with acridine orange. Acridine orange radiates a red fluorescent color at an increased concentration in a lysosome that is undamaged. Oleocanthal weakens the red fluorescent color indicating apoptosis; however, non-cancerous cells will not experience apoptosis. This is a result of lysosome membrane permeabilization promoting cancer cell death. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization is not activated by oleocanthal in non-cancerous cells. Oleocanthal has also been shown in vitro to inhibit c-met, an important tyrosine kinase receptor which is responsible for proliferation of many cell types. The same study that found these results also showed that oleocanthal had no deleterious effects on healthy control cells over a span of 48 hours, the same amount of time that it took for inhibition of c-met in MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cells are forced into cell cycle arrest during G1 phase, effectively decreasing the viability of this highly invasive cell line. =Potential medical uses= Although it is not being administered as a drug currently, many strategies are being studied to use oleocanthal as a small drug inhibitor of C-Met, as well a potential monoclonal antibody against hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) and C-Met.

It is mainly found in garden architecture, where water is to flow over or near the surface.Looking at buildings, \\"Rustication\\" Other decorative arts may use the term for other decorative patterns imitating frost or ice. Formation The origin of frostwork is somewhat controversial. Formation of cave frostwork has been attributed to moist, circulating air which, containing dissolved calcium carbonate, drifted against rock surfaces and coated them with the delicate crystals. Frostwork has also been attributed to water seepage from cave passageways in which there are relatively high evaporation rates. Occurrence Notable frostwork deposits are found in a number of caves in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, US, most notable in Wind Cave National Park and Jewel Cave National Monument and Timpanogos Cave in Utah.

The club was formed in 1878 and originally named Broadfield before changing their name in 1881. They played in the Scottish Football League between 1893 and 1911, and were based at Clune Park. In 2018 Port Glasgow Athletic was reformed joining the Strathclyde Saturday Morning Amateur Football League (SSMAFL). The club are now based from Parklea playing fields Port Glasgow. History Originally based at Devol Farm, Port Glasgow, the club moved to a new ground called Clune Park on the town's Glasgow Road. The Port played for one season in the Scottish Football Alliance in 1891‚Äì92 and spent 1892‚Äì93 playing cup- ties and friendlies. They rejoined the Scottish Alliance for 1893‚Äì94, but before the new season, the Alliance was more or less absorbed by the Scottish Football League as its Division Two. During their first season in the Scottish League they had a record seven points deducted for rule infringements. For a time this left the club at the foot of the Division with ‚àí2 points. After winning Division in 1901‚Äì02, the Port gained election into Division One. Despite struggling at the top level due to operating as an amateur club for most of the time, the club managed to stay in the division for eight years. In the Scottish Cup, they reached the semi-finals in 1898‚Äì99 and 1905‚Äì06. On the latter occasion they knocked out Rangers in the quarter-finals. They also competed often in the Glasgow Cup. Their most well-known player was probably Gladstone Hamilton, the only player to be capped by Scotland while with the club. He played on the left wing for Scotland in the 1‚Äì0 win over Ireland in the 1906 British Home Championship. Two of his brothers were also Scottish internationalists though they played for Queen's Park. Gladstone later moved to England to join Brentford. The club was relegated in 1909‚Äì10 and finished eighth in the 1910‚Äì11 Division Two table. Due to their precarious financial standing the club chose not seek re-election to membership of the Scottish League. After leaving the Scottish Football League, the club surprisingly joined the Scottish Football Union, but ceased operations as a senior side midway through the season. Apparently many of the players who were amateurs joined Port Glasgow Athletic Juniors. This club may have started out as the club's third team which they had put in the juniors in the 1890s.

It is named for an oxgang, an ancient Scottish land measure. Surrounding districts include Caiystane, Dreghorn, Redford, Fairmilehead, Colinton and Swanston and Colinton Mains. The post code area for Oxgangs is EH13. Etymology The name derives from \\"oxgang\\", an old unit of land measurement. Skene in Celtic Scotland says: : \\"in the eastern district [of Scotland] there is a uniform system of land denomination consisting of 'dabhachs', 'ploughgates' and 'oxgangs', each 'dabhach' consisting of four 'ploughgates' and each 'ploughgate' containing eight 'oxgangs'.\\" History The building of the area started in around 1953/54; before that (with the exception of Colinton Mains) there had only been a number of prefab houses and several farms but it had been mostly farmland and was basically considered to be part of the countryside. The area consists of large public housing schemes aimed at low to middle income groups, ranging from private bungalows to Edinburgh City Council-owned high rise tower blocks (although these have now been demolished). Colinton Mains Grove, a street which lies in the neighbouring housing scheme of Colinton MainsA significant majority of former council-owned properties in Oxgangs have been bought by tenants under the right to buy scheme leaving approximately 659 properties in council ownership thus making it extremely difficult to be allocated a council home in the area.\\"The City of Edinburgh Council - Council Stock by Letting Area\\" Amenities thumb There were two small shopping areas at each end of Oxgangs known locally as the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" shops. The top shops (Oxgangs Broadway) are larger and feature a small convenience store called \\"Premier - Broadway Convenience Store\\" known as \\"Dennis'\\" after the owner of the shop. Other shops are a breakfast/lunch shop (called Tak a Break), two barbers and a hairdressers, a bookies, two take aways (a chip shop and a Chinese). There is also a post office and a pharmacy. The bottom shops (Oxgangs Crescent) bottom right of photograph, were demolished along with the high flats, being replaced by housing and a small \\"Day-Today Express store\\" in Firrhill Neuk. Located in and around Oxgangs and adjacent areas are a police station, a medical practice, a public library, a nursery, three primary schools and a high school, and a pub. There are three churches in the area: Church of Scotland, Scottish Episcopal Church and St Mark's Roman Catholic Church, opened by Archbishop Gordon Gray in 1962.Scotland's Churches Trust, St Mark's Church, Oxgangs, Edinburgh: Church Overview, accessed 12 May 2019 Recently a Kingdom Hall was built in the Oxgangs Green area. Surrounding Oxgangs are three large supermarkets: a Tesco next to Firrhill High School, a Morrisons near the Swanston area and a Scotmid in Colinton Mains. In 2017, Aldi opened a store on the site where the social work building and St John's church previously stood. AC Oxgangs AC Oxgangs, a community football team, was founded in 2001. They currently operate 14 teams selected from a total player pool of around 200 youngsters which range in age from 7 to 18 years old. They play their 7-a-side and 11-a-side home games at Colinton Mains Park just beside Oxgangs Road North where a brand new clubhouse has just been erected. Younger members occasionally play 4-a-side games at the Saughton Sports Complex off Balgreen Road, but also play 7-a-side games at Colinton Mains Park. Recent changes Oxgangs tower block demolition on 26 November 2006 In 2003, after years of campaigning by residents the council took the decision to demolish and redevelop Oxgangs high rise flats. In April 2005 longstanding tower block Capelaw Court was demolished to make way for new housing. Capelaw was one of three high rise flats built in Oxgangs Crescent in 1961 and 1962. The other two buildings (Caerketton Court and Allermuir Court) were demolished in November 2006. The demolition of Capelaw Court was filmed and featured on the National Geographic Channel, which interviewed residents of Oxgangs and community leader Heather Levy. Two neighbouring primary schools situated on Oxgangs Green (Comiston and Hunters Tryst) were recently merged and renamed Pentland Primary. At first the Comiston pupils moved into the building formerly known as Hunters Tryst alongside current Tryst pupils while Comiston was renovated and a year later all staff and children moved permanently into the refurbished Comiston building, now known as Pentland Primary.

This album continues the theme set on Fitzgerald's previous album, consisting in the main part of cover versions of popular songs from the late 1960s. The production of this recording was in the hands of Richard Perry, who had joined the Reprise label in 1967. Perry later went on the produce albums by Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross. The album was re-issued on CD with alternative artwork, in 1989. Released together on one CD with Ella's final album recorded for Reprise label, Things Ain't What They Used to Be (And You Better Believe It). Background The late 1960s saw Fitzgerald's recording career change greatly, the success of her Verve years (1956 to 1966) was never repeated. After the sale of Verve records to MGM Records in 1961, Norman Granz continued to manage live performances, bookings and produce Ella Fitzgerald's recordings for the label. Granz had semi-retired to Switzerland in 1960 and when Fitzgerald's contract at Verve-MGM ended in 1967 he actively sought a new label. John Hammond of Columbia Records showed interest in signing Fitzgerald, as did Capitol Records and in September 1967 Granz signed Fitzgerald with Capitol Records. The four albums recorded at Capitol Records are the most diverse albums of Fitzgerald's career, they included a country music album; Misty Blue and one of spiritual music; Brighten the Corner. Norman Granz was not involved in the production of these albums or the choice of material. Later in 1969 Granz again began producing Fitzgerald's albums, taking up this position on the live album Sunshine of Your Love recorded for the Prestige Records label, and distributed on the MPS Records label. In late 1969 Fitzgerald signed to Reprise Records and recorded two albums for the label, before returning to a Norman Granz owned label in 1972, when Granz began the Pablo Records label.\\"Ella Fitzgerald: 1917-1996' - Chapter 14 '1964-1972' by Stuart Nicholson.

O'Donnell became prominent as an Irish republican, socialist activist, politician and writer. Early life Peadar O'Donnell was born into an Irish-speaking family in Meenmore, near An Cloch√°n Liath, County Donegal in northwest Ireland in 1893. He was the fifth son of James O'Donnell, a kiln worker, migrant labourer, and musician, and Brigid Rogers. His uncle Peter was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World in Butte, Montana, whom Peadar met on trips home to Ireland.http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2009/0621/646079-peader/ Peadar O'Donnell at 90, RT√â Radio 1 Documentary He attended St Patrick's College, Dublin, where he trained as a teacher. He taught on Arranmore Island off the west coast of Donegal. Here he was introduced to socialism, organizing for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) in 1918 before spending time in Scotland. Irish War of Independence By 1919, he was a leading organiser for the ITGWU. He attempted in Derry to organise a unit of the Irish Citizen Army (a socialist militia which had taken part in the Easter Rising). When this failed to get off the ground, O'Donnell joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and remained active in it during the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì21). He led IRA guerrilla activities in County Londonderry and Donegal in this period, which mainly involved raids on Royal Irish Constabulary and British Army barracks. In June 1920, he led an IRA force in restoring order in Derry, after Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Dorset Regiment attacks on residents since April.The Outrages by Pearse Lawlor, pages 16-18 In 1921 he became commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Northern Volunteer Division of the IRA.O'Donnell, Peadar The Knife, Irish Humanities Centre, 1980, p.6 He became known in this period as a headstrong and sometimes insubordinate officer as he often launched operations without orders and in defiance of directives from his superiors in the IRA. O'Donnell also attempted to subvert decisions of the D√°il Courts when he felt that the interests of large estate-holders were being upheld, and prevented Irish Republican Police in his Brigade area from enforcing such judgements, particularly those of the Land Arbitration Courts. In the spring of 1921 O'Donnell and his men had to evade a sweep of the county by over 1,000 British troops.√ì Drisceoil, Donal (2001). Peadar O'Donnell. Cork University Press. . Irish Civil War After the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, the IRA was split over whether to accept this compromise, which ended their hopes of an Irish Republic in the short-term, but which meant an immediate self-governing Irish Free State. O'Donnell opposed this compromise and in March 1922, was elected, along with Joe McKelvey, as a representative for Ulster on the anti-Treaty IRA's Army Executive. In April he was among the anti-Treaty IRA men who took over the Four Courts building in Dublin, which became the first focus of the outbreak of civil war with the new Free State government. The Civil War would rage for another nine months. O'Donnell escaped from the Four Courts building after its bombardment and surrender, but was subsequently captured by the Free State Army. O'Donnell was imprisoned in Mountjoy Gaol and the Curragh. Following the end of the Civil War, he participated in the mass republican hunger strike that was launched in protest at the continued imprisonment of anti-Treaty IRA men, remaining on hunger strike for 41 days. O'Donnell's prison experience and eventual escape in March 1924, are described in his 1932 memoir The Gates Flew Open.O‚ÄôDonnell, Peadar The Gates Flew Open (1932) Reflecting on the Civil War in a late interview, O'Donnell was to say: > \\"I did realise that a great many of the people who said No to the Treaty had > different views from me. And this is a factor that has never sufficiently > been stressed in dealing with the resistance to the Treaty. I think there > were many men like Michael Kilroy, Billy Pilkinton, Tom Maguire and others > too, who, having taken an oath of loyalty to the Republic and having killed > in defense of it, and pals of theirs having died in defense of it, I think > that their vow to the Republic was a vow that they couldn't shed themselves > of. They were the kind of people that were bound to say no, and would have > to be fired on to come down from the high ground of the Republic to the low > level of the Treaty. They were the kind of men who make martyrs, but I don't > think they make revolutions.\\"O‚ÄôDonnell, Peadar, 1983 Interview in Peader > O'Donnell at 90, RT√â Radio 1, 22mins Socialism Unlike many Irish republicans of this era, O'Donnell did not see the republican cause solely in Irish nationalist terms. O'Donnell also advocated a social revolution in an independent Ireland, seeing himself as a follower of James Connolly, the socialist republican executed for his part in the leadership of the Easter Rising. The period 1919‚Äì23 had seen much social unrest in Ireland, including land occupations by the tenants in rural areas and the Occupation of factories by workers. O'Donnell, in fact, is regarded as the first Irish person to use the term \\"occupation\\" in relation to the occupation of a workplace, when he and the staff of Monaghan Asylum occupied the hospital in 1919. \\"The occupation was, in fact, the first action in Ireland to describe itself as a soviet, and the Red Flag was raised above it.\\"http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/04/28/book-review-peadar-odonnell- donal-drisceoil/ William Wall in Irish Left Review It was also one of the first declared Soviets outside of Russia. O'Donnell became governor of the Soviet and declared a 48-hour week for the workers and sacked the matron for insubordination. Eventually they went back to work pending a settlement. O'Donnell believed that the IRA should have adopted the people's cause and supported land re-distribution and workers' rights. He blamed the anti-Treaty republicans' lack of support among the Irish public in the Civil War on their lack of a social programme. Some republicans, notably Liam Mellows, did share O'Donnell's view, and in fact there was a large redistribution of land from absentee landlords to tenants in the new Free State. According to author and amateur historian Tom Mahon, > \\"There were many contradictions and weaknesses in O'Donnell's polemic. In > reality, the IRA was a petit bourgeoisie conspiratorial organisation rather > than a workers' and peasants' army. It was firmly rooted in the nineteenth- > century concept of a nationalist revolution and its few socialists were > largely peripheral to the organisation. Kevin O'Higgins, a leading Sinn F√©in > activist during the Anglo-Irish War, famously said, 'We were probably the > most conservative-minded revolutionaries who ever put through a successful > revolution.' Additionally, O'Donnell failed to justify the IRA's refusal to > acknowledge the wishes of the majority of the southern Irish population who > supported the Free State. Most glaring of all, he had no satisfactory > explanation of what to do with the Protestant working-class in Northern > Ireland, who were prepared to take up arms to prevent their 'liberation' by > the IRA. Despite the many flaws of his argument, he has received much > serious attention from historians and biographers.\\"Tom Mahon & James J > Gillogly, Decoding the IRA, Mercier Press, 2008. Pages 80‚Äì81. Post-Civil War politics In 1923, while still in prison, he was elected as a Sinn F√©in Teachta D√°la (TD) for Donegal. In 1924, on release from internment, O'Donnell became a member of the Executive and Army Council of the anti-Treaty IRA. He also took over as the editor of the republican newspaper An Phoblacht. He did not take his seat in the D√°il and did not stand at the June 1927 general election. He tried to steer it in a left-wing direction, and to this end founded organisations such as the Irish Working Farmers' Committee, which sent representatives to the Soviet Union and to the Profintern. O'Donnell also founded the Anti-Tribute League, which opposed the repaying of annuities to the British government under the Irish Land Acts (these were set at a rate of ¬£3,100,000 a year, a huge cost to the new state; they were ceased by √âamon de Valera on his accession to power in 1932, and in retaliation the British government declared an Economic War; the payments were resolved in 1938 by an agreement that Ireland would pay Britain ¬£10 million). O'Donnell also founded a short-lived socialist republican party, Saor √âire. O'Donnell and the IRA found themselves in conflict with their former enemies of the Civil War era. √âamon de Valera, who had founded Fianna F√°il from anti- Treaty republicans, came to power in Ireland in 1932, and subsequently legalised the IRA in 1932‚Äì36. O'Donnell announced that there would be \\"no free speech for traitors\\" (by which he meant Cumann na nGaedheal, the Free State party) and his men attacked Cumann na nGaedheal political meetings. Eoin O'Duffy, a former Irish Army General and Garda S√≠och√°na commissioner, contemporaneously founded the fascist Blueshirts, which attacked Republican meetings. There was street violence between the two sides before both the Blueshirts and the IRA were banned. Republican Congress The flag of the Republican Congress, The Starry Plough O'Donnell's attempts at persuading the remnants of the defeated anti-Treaty IRA to become a socialist organisation ended in failure. Eventually, O'Donnell and other left-wing republicans left the IRA to co-found the Republican Congress in 1934 with other socialists, communists and Cumann na mBan members.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 83 The overriding aim of the Republican Congress was the maintenance of a united front against fascism.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 84 Despite having left the IRA, O'Donnell and others were tried in absentia by an IRA court-martial presided over by Se√°n Russell which dismissed them 'with ignominy'. The high point of the Republican Congress was between May and September 1934, when it achieved remarkable success as an umbrella organisation for class agitation. It earned the wrath of the IRA leadership, which banned IRA members from joining it. This led to widespread defections to the Congress from the IRA in Dublin, and the spectacular success of the Republican Congress in organising Belfast Protestants under the Republican Congress banner. On a march by the Shankill Road branch to Bodenstown churchyard in June 1934 to honour the founding father of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone the Shankill republicans, many of whom were members of the Northern Ireland Socialist Party, carried banners with slogans such as 'Break the Connection with Capitalism' and 'United Irishmen of 1934'. To the bemusement of many, the IRA leadership blocked the Belfast contingent from carrying their banners and attempted to seize them. The Republican Congress spearheaded attacks on Blueshirts in Dublin, while the IRA rank and file continued attacks on them elsewhere.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 85 By September 1934 the state was crushing the Blueshirts; leading Fine Gael figures abandoned the Blueshirt leadership under Eoin O'Duffy, reverting to parliamentary politics. With the demise of the Blueshirts imminent, 186 delegates attended what became the final Republican Congress assembly in Rathmines Town Hall on 29 and 30 September 1934. The Congress split on a proposal by Michael Price to turn it into a political party, a proposal which was perceived by the Communist Party of Ireland and other vested interests as threatening their power.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 88 O'Donnell also rejected the proposal, arguing that the Left had more power as a united front.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 89 Spanish Civil War and after In 1936 O'Donnell was in Barcelona in order to attend the planned People's Olympiad on the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He joined the Spanish Republican militia that supported the Popular Front government against Francisco Franco's military insurgency. When he returned to Ireland, he encouraged other republicans to fight for the Spanish Republic. Republican Congress members led by Frank Ryan and some Communist Party of Ireland members joined the International Brigades, where they were known as the Connolly Column (named after James Connolly). This was an unpopular stance in Ireland, as the powerful Catholic Church supported Franco's Catholic Nationalists. Attitudes to the Spanish Civil War mirrored the divisions of Ireland's civil war. O'Donnell remarked that the bishops had condemned the anti-Treaty side in the latter for opposing a democratic government, but were now advocating the same thing themselves. O'Donnell's former comrade Eoin O'Duffy, founder of the Blueshirts, led the ultra-Catholic Irish Brigade to Spain to support the Nationalists; they were sent home by Franco. O'Donnell was chairman of the anti-Vietnam War \\"Irish Voice on Vietnam\\" organisation. Writings After the 1940s, O'Donnell devoted more of his time to writing and culture and less to politics, from which he withdrew more or less completely. He published his first novel, Storm, in 1925. This was followed by Islanders (1928), which received national and international acclaim,Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 54 The New York Times describing it as a novel of \\"quiet brilliance and power\\", conservative London magazine The Spectator \\"an intensely beautiful picture of peasant life.\\" The writer Benedict Kiely recalled meeting a Chicago man in Iowa in 1968 who had never been to Ireland but could describe the landscape of west Donegal, and the ways of its people, in minute detail despite being blind. When Kiely asked him how he knew so much he revealed he had read Islanders in Braille. Adrigoole, published in 1929, was swiftly followed by The Knife (1930) and On the Edge of the Stream (1934). O'Donnell also went to Spain and later published Salud! An Irishman in Spain (1937). Adrigoole was set in Donegal, but based on the real-life story of the O'Sullivans, a Cork family who had all died of starvation in 1927, and is 'by far the gloomiest and most pessimistic of his books'. Other books by O'Donnell included The Big Windows (1955) and Proud Island (1975). The Big Windows is, in the words of Donal √ì Drisceoil, 'by common consent his finest literary achievement.... The reviews at the time, and on its reissue in 1983, were universally positive.'Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 116 Islanders and Adrigoole were translated into Ulster Irish (Donegal dialect) by Seosamh Mac Grianna as Muintir an Oile√°in and Eadarbhaile, respectively. All of his work has a strong social consciousness, works like Adrigoole, as well as being powerful pieces in themselves, exemplify socialist analyses of Irish society. A biographical documentary entitled Peadair√≠n na Stoirme was screened on TG4 in 2009. After World War II, O'Donnell edited, with R√≥is√≠n Walsh, the literary journal The Bell from 1946 until 1954, having founded it with Se√°n √ì Faol√°in, its first editor, in 1940.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 110 O'Donnell was one of four Irishmen named on George Orwell's 1948 list of people unsuitable for anti-communist propaganda work for the British government's Information Research Department; the others were Se√°n O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw and Cecil Day-Lewis. His one play, Wrack, was first performed at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on 21 November 1932,Wrack , Irish Playography website. Retrieved 27 April 2010. and published by Jonathan Cape the following year. In total O'Donnell wrote seven novels and one play, in addition to three autobiographical accounts: The Gates flew Open (London, 1932), about his part in the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War; Salud! An Irishman in Spain (London, 1937), about his time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and There Will Be Another Day (Dublin, 1963), his account of the land annuities campaign in the 1920s and 1930s.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 151 Peadar and his wife Lile travelled widely across Europe. On a trip to the United States in 1939, during which he met the singer Paul Robeson, O'Donnell is reputed to have taught Robeson the words of the song \\"Kevin Barry\\", which became one of Robeson's most performed numbers. Personal life Following his escape from Kilmainham jail, Peadar married Cumann na mBan officer Lile O'Donel on 25 June 1924.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 36 He had never met Lile before this, but they had communicated extensively during his time in prison‚Äîshe had been a conduit for Republican messages from the outside, while he was heavily involved in communications from the inside. O'Donnell himself describes a story of how she bluffed her way in to see Thomas Johnson, then leader of the Labour party, and gave him a message that he would be shot if O'Donnell were executed.Peadar O'Donnell, The Gates Flew Open (1932), ch.28 Witnesses at Lile and Peadar's wedding included his brother Frank, Sin√©ad de Valera, Fiona Plunkett of Cumann na mBan and Mary MacSwiney. They began their honeymoon in a hotel in County Dublin that evening, but by the following morning O'Donnell was on the run once again because he had been identified. Lile had a large inheritance and this allowed him to devote himself to his writing and political activism, allowing him to, in the words of Donal √ì Drisceoil, 'live the life of that favourite bogeyman of police reports, the \\"professional agitator\\"'. They lived in Marlborough Road in Donnybrook for many years. They later lived in 174'Noble agitator and natural leader', Review of Peadar O'Donnell by Peter Hegarty Upper Drumcondra Road in Drumcondra, and it was there that he and Lile raised their nephew. After Peadar's brother Joe was killed in an accident in New York, Peadar and Lile offered to bring Joe's young son, Peadar Joe, who was almost five, back with them to Ireland for an extended holiday. When World War II broke out, Peadar Joe stayed with them permanently and they raised him as their son.Donal √ì Drisceoil, Peadar O'Donnell (Cork, 2001), p. 103 They had no children of their own.

This reaction is thought to proceed via a dioxirane intermediate, generated from the catalyst ketone by oxone (potassium peroxymonosulfate). The addition of the sulfate group by the oxone facilitates the formation of the dioxirane by acting as a good leaving group during ring closure. It is notable for its use of a non-metal catalyst and represents an early example of organocatalysis. The reaction was first discovered by Yian Shi (Âè≤‰∏ÄÂÆâ, pinyin: Sh«ê Yƒ´-ƒÅn) of Colorado State University in 1996. 311x311pxThe Shi epoxidation  Brief Historical Background  187x187px Many attempts at the synthesis of an efficient non-metal catalyst were made before one was discovered. The problem with previous catalysts was the rapid decomposition/oxidation of the dioxirane intermediate and lack of electrophilicity of the reactive ketone. Aromatic ketones were proposed, and many subsequent variations of oxoammonium salts were used, but were ineffective in promoting epoxidation because of the oxidative instability of the amide groups and high flexibility of the seven-membered rings. Enantioselectivity of these early catalysts were also lowered because of large distances between the asymmetric subunits and reaction centers, yielding less than 10 percent in enantiomeric excess. The catalyst discovered by Yian Shi's group in 1996 was derived from D-fructose, and has a stereogenic center close to the reacting center (ketone)- the rigid six-membered ring structure of the catalyst and adjacent quaternary ring group minimizes epimerization of this stereocenter. Oxidation by the active dioxirane catalyst takes place from the si-face, due to steric hindrance of the opposing re-face. This catalyst functions efficiently as an asymmetric catalyst for unfunctionalized trans- olefins. 137x137px  Formation of Dioxirane Catalyst  Under normal pH conditions, an excess of 3 stoichiometric amounts of ketone catalyst are needed due to a high rate of decomposition. At basic pH conditions greater than 10 (pH 10.5) substoichiometric amounts (0.2-0.3) are needed for epoxidations, lowering the decomposition of reagents by disfavoring the Baeyer-Villiger side reaction. Higher temperatures result in further decomposition; thus a low temperature of zero degrees Celsius is used. Biphasic shuttle used in epoxidation Decomposition of reagents is bimolecular (second-order reaction rate), so low amounts of oxone and catalyst are used. The reaction is mediated by a D-fructose derived catalyst, which produces the (R,R) enantiomer of the resulting epoxide. Solubilities of olefin organic substrate and oxidant (oxone) differ, and thus a biphasic medium is needed. The generation of the active catalyst species takes place in the aqueous layer, and is shuttled to the organic layer with the reactants by tetrabutylammonium sulfate.The ketone catalyst is continuously regenerated in a catalytic cycle, and thus can catalyze the epoxidation in small amounts.377x377px The first step in the catalytic cycle reaction is the nucleophilic addition reaction of the oxone with the ketone group on the catalyst (intermediate 1). This forms the reactive intermediate number 2 species, the Criegee intermediate that can potentially lead to unwanted side reactions, such as the Baeyer-Villiger reaction (see below). The generation of intermediate species number 3 occurs under basic conditions, with a removal of the hydrogen from the hydroxy group to form a nucleophilic oxygen anion. The sulfate group facilitates the subsequent formation of the dioxirane, intermediate species number 4, by acting as a good leaving group during the 3-exo-trig cyclization. The activated dioxirane catalytic species then transfers an oxygen atom to the alkene, leading to a regeneration of the original catalyst. = Side Reactions = A potential side reaction that may occur is the Baeyer-Villiger reaction of intermediate 2, where there is a rearrangement of the peroxy group that results in the formation of the relative ester. The extent of this side reaction declines with the rise of pH, and increases the nucleophilicity of the oxone, making basic conditions favorable for the overall epoxidation and reactivity of the catalytic species.329x329px  Mechanism of Epoxidation  The oxygen from the dioxirane group generated on the organic catalyst is transferred to the alkene, in what is thought to be a concerted mechanism, although the presence of an oxygen anion intermediate through an Sn2 mechanism may transpire. 321x321px  Preparation of D-Fructose Derivative The catalyst is formed by reaction with acetone under basic conditions, with the hydroxyl groups of the fructose ring acting as nucleophiles, their nucleophilicity increased by the basic conditions created by potassium carbonate. The electron withdrawing substituents (alpha-ether groups) encourage the formation of the ketone from the oxidizing agent pyridinium chlorochromate by increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, via a stabilizing delocalization of the forming œÄ C-C bonds into the œÉ* C-O bonds of the adjacent ethers.320x320px  Transition States and Enantiomeric Selectivity  There are two proposed transition states, whose geometries are speculated and not corroborated by experimental evidence, but are attributed to stereoelectronic effects. The spiro transition state is favored over the planar due to the non-bonding orbitals of the superior oxygen donating into the œÄ* anti-bonding C-C orbitals of the reacting alkene, providing a stabilizing delocalization of electrons. Donation of these electrons into the forming C-O œÉ bonds of the epoxide bonds also encourages the formation of the spiro-product (the geometry of the product is aligned as well). The planar configuration is disfavored due to lack of pi-backbonding and steric hindrance of the alkyl groups with large alkyl functional groups of the catalytic ring. 304x304pxThe previously mentioned configurations are favored over the transition states of the opposing enantiomers because of unfavorable steric interactions between the R-alkyl groups (see below) and the ether-alkyl functional groups of the catalyst ring.302x302pxThe enantiomeric success of this epoxidation is relatively high compared to metal catalysts, and generally results in a high enantiomeric excess exceeding 80 percent.  Reaction Yield and Stereoselectivity  This procedure generates epoxides with high enantiomeric excesses from trans-disubstituted alkenes and trisubstituted alkenes. Cis- disubstituted alkenes and styrenes are asymmetrically epoxidized using a similar catalyst. Generation of (R,R) epoxides from corresponding alkenes increases in stereoselectivity with increased steric bulk of substituent R groups (especially in trans-olefins).

History  On 4 November 1775, the Georgia Regiment was authorised in the Continental Army, and organised from 20 January‚Äì28 April 1776 at Savannah, Georgia, consisting of eight companies (the 8th being a rifle company). On 27 February 1776 the regiment joined the Southern Department/Army. Redesignated 5 July 1776 as the 1st Georgia Regiment on formation of the 2nd Georgia and 3rd Georgia Regiments. Assigned 23 December 1777 to the Georgia Brigade, an element of the Southern Department. In 1777 the regiment was still short of men, mostly in-part due to the Colony of Georgia being sparsely populated, and the colonel reported that only 10 riflemen of the rifle company had been found, and needed additional soldiers soon. The regiment soon began to lose many of its men to desertion, disease, and combat, but elements of it served on until 1779 and 1780 when the last of the Georgia Line, six officers without men, were captured at Charleston, South Carolina.Wright, p. 313.Knight, pp. 7, 9, 10.Berg, pp. 45‚Äì46.Smith, Kiley, and Black, pp. 79, 90, 99, 107, 111.

Reorganised and redesignated 1 January 1783 as the Georgia Battalion, and consisted of three companies, along with two troops of cavalry. Furloughed in summer 1783 at Charleston, South Carolina, and disbanded 15 November 1783.

Public transport in Helsinki consists of bus, tram, metro, local railway and ferry services. The system is managed by Helsinki Region Transport (Finnish: Helsingin seudun liikenne, or HSL) and covers Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen, Vantaa and the outlying Kerava, Kirkkonummi, Sipoo and Tuusula. Volvo B8RLE 8900LE tri-axle bus in Hakaniemi, Helsinki Helsinki is currently the only city in Finland to have a tram system. The city of Turku dismantled its tram system in 1972, and Finland lost the city of Vyborg to the USSR in World War II and the city subsequently withdrew its trams in 1957. In 2017, construction started on a tram line in the city of Tampere; services are scheduled to initiate in 2021.Raitiotie 50% of commuting trips within the city limits of Helsinki are made using public transport and only 28% using a private car,Survey on perception of quality of life in 75 European cities (published by European Commission in 2009) while 48% of the households have access to a car. The ridership is typical to a European city, but if Helsinki were in U.S., it would have the second highest ridership after New York. Due to a large area and low population density, the spread of population looks more like an American city, not a European one (but the use of public transport is much higher than in the USA). Partly due to lack of trams or rapid transit outside the Helsinki Region, the ridership in other cities in Finland is significantly lower. The Helsinki Metro, opened in 1982, was the first, and so far the only, rapid-transit metro system in all of Finland. The metro currently serves the eastern suburbs of Helsinki, some areas close to the city center, and parts of southern Espoo. For the first 16 years of its existence, the line was topologically only one straight line, but in 1998 a branch to the eastern suburb of Vuosaari was opened. The construction of the long-debated western extension of the metro system into southern parts of Espoo was approved by Espoo City Council in 2006. The eight-station first phase was opened in November 2017. The second phase which extends metro service west to Kivenlahti, is under construction.www.lansimetro.fi - an information portal dedicated to the West Metro expansion in the Helsinki capital region. Helsinki is also planning to extend the existing metro line from its eastern terminus at Mellunkyl√§ to √ñstersundom, an area annexed from Sipoo by Helsinki in 2009 for the purpose of building a large new planned community. Local trains operate on grade-separated, dedicated tracks on three rail lines that radiate out from the Helsinki Central railway station. Most routes offer rapid- transit-like service with a peak headway of 10 or 15 minutes, the last trains departing from Helsinki city center only after 1 am, or 4 am on weekend nights. A service to the Helsinki Airport began in July 2015, when the Ring Rail Line extension to the system opened. A number of the local and regional trains run further out to towns as far north as Riihim√§ki and Lahti and as far west as Karis on tracks shared with long-distance trains. These regional services have headways of up to one hour and often more limited operating hours. Long-distance trains depart from the Central Railway Station and Pasila railway station to destinations across Finland. Intercity trains offer connections to major Finnish cities and international services to Saint Petersburg and Moscow in Russia. A tunnel has been proposed to connect Helsinki with Tallinn, though the proposal is still in the investigation phase. Bus services =Trunk bus lines= Helsingin Bussiliikenne bus on HSL trunk line 550, on the day the traffic started with the new fleet and image. In August 2013, HSL launched the first trunk bus route, the orbital line 550, formerly branded Jokeri. The trunk lines are meant to provide \\"metro-like\\" service with very short headways and a distinguishable fleet. The second orbital trunk line, number 560, opened in August 2015. \\\\- information about the core transport service plans in Finnish.

A Helsingin Bussiliikenne bus on line 93 at It√§keskus Kaadekuja bus stop Internal bus routes of Helsinki can be found almost anywhere in Helsinki. For some parts of the city, even high-density, these buses provide the backbone of the public transportation system. \\\\- Some high-density (3500+/km2) suburbs such as Munkkivuori, Pihlajisto, It√§-Pakila and Latokartano are currently served only by buses. An electronic, battery-powered timetable display found at selected stops The routes are drawn and the timetables set by HSL, but operated by independent companies. HSL tenders a route or a set of routes and the company offering to operate the route for the best quality-price ratio will get the contract. The quality is measured with a pointing system which gives points for such aspects as the quietness, environmental efficiency and the size of the buses that would be used. The biggest bus operators are Nobina Finland, Veolia Transport Finland and Helsingin Bussiliikenne (HelB). These companies run a majority of the contract services. One rapidly expanding company is the VR (state rail) owned Pohjolan Liikenne, which has recently been very successful with the tendering. Mostly the expansion has been at the cost of HelB. \\\\- a news article about the a recent result of the tender, with the largest companies mentioned. \\\\- information about a recent HSL tender, with HelB losing all its current lines Many of the buses operating in eastern Helsinki act as feeder lines for the Helsinki Metro. Nearly all other routes have the other end of their lines in the downtown near the Helsinki Central railway station. Such exceptions are present as dedicated lines operating directly from a suburb to another past the centre (for example Helsinki buses 51‚Äì54, 56‚Äì59). The line numbers for the internal lines contain two digits and for some a letter. Most lines are operated between 5:30 and 23:30, the most popular between 5:00 and 1:30. In daytime outside of rush hours the basic interval for buses is mostly either 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes depending on the length and the demand of the line. Nighttime lines that operate only from 23:30 to 1:30 (and sometimes early morning) are signified by the additional letter N. Recently the tradition of having designated night routes has been broken and replaced with N-variants of daytime routes. Other letters include: *A: lengthened or clockwise-circular route *B: shortened or anti-clockwise-circular route *K: exception in route, often insignificant *T: trams to terminal (4T, 6T), 100-series buses via Lauttasaari *V: faster or more direct route *Z: faster or more direct route (usually along highway) Helsinki bus terminals include Kamppi (surface area), Rautatientori, Elielinaukio and Hakaniemi. Larger metro stations have their own feeder bus terminals. =Regional services= Kampin keskus, the terminal of buses to Espoo The regional bus lines are today managed by HSL in similar manner to the management of the internal lines of Helsinki. The regional lines are specially designed for moving people between important points in the metropolitan area and for the sole purpose of getting to downtown Helsinki. These lines tend to use the fastest possible way to get out of Helsinki, usually through motorways. Lines from southern Espoo terminate at Kampin keskus, the ones from central Espoo and western Vantaa terminate at Elielinaukio and the ones from northern Vantaa and Kerava terminate at Rautatientori. The last two mentioned are located next to the central railway station. The operating hours for regional lines are similar to those of internal lines, but the departures are often not as frequent. At most times, the line numbers are composed of three digits and occasionally a letter or two accompanying them. Two-number regional lines are rare, and thus far only two have been created: 39 Kamppi-Myyrm√§ki and 74 Hakaniemi-Porttipuisto (IKEA). Tram A modern Variotram on line 3B in T√∂√∂l√∂ Helsinki's tram network has been operated continuously with electric drive since 1900 and it is mostly of a traditional type, with all of the tramways located on the streets, on both dedicated tram lanes and in mixed traffic. The network covers the densely populated central districts and some of the adjacent areas, but it has been expanded only very modestly after the 1950s. The network is composed of 11 lines, all of which except one (line 8) run through some part of the city centre. Over 50 million trips are made with the trams each year. The tram system is managed and operated by HKL. Metro Interior of a series 200 metro The metro is the backbone for traffic east and west of central Helsinki. The system consists of two lines, M1 and M2, with a total of 25 stations. The metro is managed and operated by HKL. Commuter rail New Sm5 commuter train at Riihim√§ki The commuter rail system is the backbone for the areas northeast and northwest from downtown. The network reaches relatively far from Helsinki with metro-like services from Helsinki to Kerava, Kirkkonummi and the Helsinki Airport. The network is managed by HSL and operated by VR. Trains not managed by HSL reach even further, to Lahti, Tampere via Riihim√§ki and Karis. Ferry M/S Suomenlinna II Helsinki has two ferry lines, both operated by Suomenlinnan Liikenne Oy. One ferry connects Suomenlinna to the mainland. The ferries are the only connection to the mainland for the residents of Suomenlinna, though a tunnel for emergency vehicle access is in place. The second line connects the mainland to the Korkeasaari Zoo. One line departs from Market Square and the other from Katajanokka. The ferry to the Zoo is not part of the general ticket system. There is a land access to the Zoo with bus number 16. City bikes Helsinki's city bike system was opened in May 2016 with 50 city bike stations and 500 bikes serving the inner city area. The system was expanded in 2017 to cover an additional 100 stations and 1000 bikes. Currently the network consists of 345 stations with 3450 bikes. The annual ridership in 2018 was 3,218,800. Tickets =Zones= Under the new fare system adopted in April 2019 the region is divided onto four arch shaped zones: A, B, C and D. Zone A covers the inner Helsinki to about five kilometers from the Helsinki Central Station. Zone B covers rest of Helsinki (excluding areas in the east added to Helsinki in 2003) and parts of Vantaa and Espoo and whole Kauniainen. It covers up to 14 km from the Central station. Zone C covers the east most parts of Helsinki, rest of Espoo and Vantaa, including the airport, and small parts of Sipoo and Tuusula. Zone D covers most of Sipoo, Tuusula and all of Kerava in the northeast, and Siuntio and Kirkkonummi in the west. One has to buy at least two zones, although one can buy the D zone separately. One can also buy three or four zones. If one has pass for 2-3 zones, one can buy additional zones at a reduced price. =Ticket types= The transport system offers a vast number of different tickets and several ways to get them. Single fare tickets can be bought from bus drivers, ticket machines or by a mobile app. Each metro station and ferry stop, and most railway stations, are equipped with at least one ticket machine. The cost of an AB or BC ticket for an adult in 2019 is ‚Ç¨4.00 if bought from a driver and ‚Ç¨2.80 by other means. Tram drivers do not sell tickets. For zones ABC it then prices are ‚Ç¨6.50 and ‚Ç¨4.60 respectively. Most users of the public transport have a Travel Card, an RFID card used as an electronic ticket. Users can load period and value on their cards. Period ticket offers unlimited travel for the dates paid for. Value is used to pay for one trip, which may contain changes. The price of a single trip is lower when paid with the travel card instead of buying a single fare ticket. Two zone single trip tickets are valid for one 80‚Äì110 minutes depending on the zones used. AB, BC and D tickets have 80 minutes and ABCD has 110 minutes. =Fare collection= On most buses, the driver checks tickets as passengers board.

Danielle was the fourth named storm and third hurricane of the season. Danielle formed on August 13, 2004 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean and remained over the central Atlantic, peaking as a strong Category 2 hurricane on August 16\\\\. Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August 21 and dissipating on August 24\\\\. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. As a result, there was no impact caused by the storm. Meteorological history Hurricane Danielle began as a vigorous tropical wave over Africa. As the wave emerged into the Atlantic, it quickly became more organized due to favorable conditions, including low wind shear. The circulation consolidated and spawned Tropical Depression Four on the morning of August 13 south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle. As Danielle tracked westward into the open Atlantic early on August 14, the storm encountered warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification began to take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye began to form. Over a 24‚Äëhour period ending in the morning of August 15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978 mbar and the winds increased to 90 mph (145 km/h), making it a high-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Danielle levelled off somewhat in intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural changes in the storm related to the small wind field relative to the size of the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category 2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35¬∞W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h), just under Category 3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16. Hurricane Danielle weakening on August 17 The northward movement also sent Danielle into somewhat increased shear, which allowed it to begin to weaken. However, the weakening was gradual at first as the waters remained fairly warm. The abrupt northerly turn meant that, for a while on August 17, the Azores were threatened by Danielle in the long-range forecast, as a weakened tropical storm or extratropical cyclone. Danielle weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on the evening of August 17 as shear continued to increase. Danielle began to turn to the northeast early on August 18, and at that point, the weakening trend accelerated. Some of the deep convection was being removed from the system due to wind shear, and that morning, Danielle weakened to a tropical storm. The rapid weakening trend continued that afternoon, and Danielle weakened to a low-end tropical storm with 45 mph (75 km/h) winds late that evening. However, the intensity levelled off early on August 19 and Danielle remained a tropical storm for the next couple days over moderately warm water of around 78 ¬∞F (just under 26 ¬∞C) while south-southwest of the Azores. Intermittent deep convection continued to fire up, keeping the storm afloat for the next day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores. Impact, naming, and records Hurricane Danielle did not have any impact on land and no damage or fatalities were reported. No ships were reported to have come into contact with Danielle. When Danielle became a tropical storm at 24.8¬∞W, it was the farthest east that a storm had received a name since Hurricane Alberto in the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season.

Scouting in Nicaragua started in 1917 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1946. The coeducational association has 1,509 members (as of 2011).  History  The first Nicaraguan Scout group developed in Bluefields, Nicaragua; its founders were Reverend Joseph A. Harrison and Aubry Campbell Ingram, a boy who had read an article on the Boy Scouts of America. On his inquiries, Reverend Harrison wrote to the BSA headquarters asking for more information. In addition to information, Reverend Harrison received the authorization to start a Boy Scout troop, the Moravian Uno, which was affiliated to the BSA. In the following years the movement spread through the country; its groups formed a loosely connected network. The first group on the Pacific Coast was founded in 1929 in Granada, Nicaragua by Vital Miranda Whitford with the help of Father Almanza, a Catholic priest. The Roman Catholic Church and especially the Jesuits gave vital support to the arising Scout Movement. In 1942, the Nicaraguan Scout groups formed the Federaci√≥n Nacional de Boy Scouts de Nicaragua, which was recognized by the government in the same year. The federation became a member of the WOSM in 1946. In the 1950s, the federation changed its name to Asociaci√≥n de Scouts de Nicaragua. Training leaders has been one of the Nicaraguan Scouts priorities. Scouts have been active for the good of their society more than in many other countries. They gather used books to sponsor and equip small schools. They worked in Managua to relieve suffering when the great earthquake of 1972 struck and Hurricane Fifi wrecked Honduras. Nicaraguan Scouts also assisted during Hurricane Mitch of 1998, which left thousands dead and many more homeless. They assisted in disaster relief. They were mobilized in the mountainous areas to help with the search for survivors and remove the tons of dirt by hand from the remote highways so that relief and supplies could be brought in. The Scouts were recognized by the government and other world relief organizations for their assistance in the disaster relief, even though many of the Scouts themselves were victims of the hurricane. During the Sandinista period the ASN could not maintain normal Scout activities, due to the civil war in the country. Nicaragua was three times host of the Camporee Scout Centroamericano: * 1952, I Camporee Scout Centroamericano in Punta Chiltepe * 1965, VII Camporee Scout Centroamericano in El Coyotepe near Masaya * 2004, XX Camporee Scout Centroamericano in El Coyotepe near Masaya Program and ideals The association has four sections: * Lobatos (Cub Scouts) * Scouts * Caminantes (Senior Scouts) * Rovers The Scout motto is Siempre listos, Always prepared.

Founded in 1906 and relocated to Algonquin Park, Ontario, in 1908. Camp Northway has maintained a distinctive ethos of simple camping, crafts, and drama. Much of this is the continuing legacy of the Camp's charismatic founder, Miss Fannie L. Case. Setting Camp Northway is situated on a peninsula on Cache Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park. The Camp features a number of historic wooden structures, built by some of the first campers, and a new library and craft house. The lake setting lends itself well to canoe trips, which last from 2‚Äì8 days. The Counsellor-In-Training trips are longer; up to 18 days as of 2005. A Google Maps location can be seen at: http://www.ourkids.net/camp/camp- northway-wendigo/25 History Miss Case, c. 1925 Image:northwaycamping.jpgCamping, 1925 The Camp came about after Fannie L. Case, a teacher, met a doctor on a camping trip. While discussing education, the idea arose of a summer camp for girls. Held in its first year at the doctor's camping ground, the camp then moved in 1908 to Algonquin Park. Case believed that life in camp should be lived in the same manner as on camping trips, so as to better prepare for trips away. This tradition survives in that all participants live in canvas tents on wooden platforms while at the camp. Fannie L. Case was evidently a charismatic leader, who believed that camp should be informal and flexible, \\"with no set rules, no boundaries, no whistles, bells or bugles\\". As well as its outdoor emphasis, Camp Northway has always had a strong element of music and drama. Something of Case's personality can be found in these words: > There should be leisure at camp, time to dream. We used to describe camp as > \\"well spent leisure\\". I remember being on the lookout for writings on this > subject as a justification of our effort, such as Stevenson's \\"Apology for > an idler\\". Now we know that leisure is a condition of full and spontaneous > living. It prepares for action later. \\"It is the free port of the > imagination\\". Camp Northway today Camp Northway is now owned by Brookes Prewitt with Camp Wendigo, a tripping outpost for boys. Described as a \\"wilderness camp for girls\\", it takes 50 campers at a time ‚Äì about 150 over the course of a season, from July 1 to August 19. A family camp is run for approximately one week at the end of camp. It still has no electricity or running water, has a single wood-burning stove, and takes pride in its closeness to its rugged roots.

Life and times Terragno was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1943 and obtained a Law Degree from the University of Buenos Aires in 1967, founding the law firm of Terragno & Associates. He married Sonia Pascual S√°nchez, with whom he had two children. He became a prestigious journalist, appointed editor-in-chief for the newsmagazine Confirmado between 1967 and 1968, was a columnist for La Opini√≥n newspaper, and an editor in Cuestionario magazine. Terragno became Adjuct Professor of Law at his alma mater in 1973. Intimidation by the dictatorship installed in 1976 led to his exile in Caracas, where he became editor-in-chief of El Diario de Caracas. In 1980, he was appointed researcher for the Institute of Latin American Studies in London and for the London School of Economics, posts he held until 1982. He remained in London as editor-in-chief of Letters, until 1987.Biografia, terragno.org Affiliated to the centrist Radical Civic Union since 1961, he was appointed Minister of Public Works by President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n in 1987, whereby he initiated a modest program of privatizations. Terragno received the Ordre National du M√©rite from French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, in 1987. Elected Congressman in 1993, he campaigned against the Olivos Pact negotiated between UCR leader Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n and President Carlos Menem, who sought the deal in a bid to amend the Argentine Constitution to allow himself reelection. He sought the UCR's Vice-Presidential nomination in a ticket with Federico Storani, but was defeated by Alfons√≠n's choice: R√≠o Negro Province Governor Horacio Massaccesi. Loyal to the struggling UCR, he agreed to be Massaccesi's Chief of Staff-designate in March, a move that did not stave off defeat in the May 1995 elections. Out of Congress, he sought and won election as President of the UCR, helping negotiate a successful alliance with the center-left Frepaso. The Alliance's victory in the 1997 midterm elections paved the way for their victory in 1999. Terragno resigned from Congress to accept the influential post of Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers for President Fernando de la R√∫a, though fallout over a bribery scandal involving the President led to his resignation in October 2000. He was elected Senator for Buenos Aires in 2001 and served until 2007, by which time he sat on a splinter UCR ticket. Terragno began efforts to join Vice President Julio Cobos (a popular UCR figure distanced from the President, Cristina Kirchner) in an alliance with ARI leader Elisa Carri√≥ in January 2009, though no agreement was reached.Articulos, terragno.org Selected publications *La Simulaci√≥n (2005) *El Peronismo de los '70 (2005) *Falklands/Malvinas (2002) *Maitland & San Mart√≠n (1998) *Bases para un Modelo de Crecimiento, Empleo y Bienestar (1996) *El Nuevo Modelo (1994) *Proyecto 95 (1993) *La Argentina del Siglo 21 (1985) *The Challenge of Real Development (1987). *Muerte y Resurrecci√≥n de los Pol√≠ticos (1981) *Memorias del Presente (1984) *Contratapas (1976) *Los 400 D√≠as de Per√≥n (1974) *Los Due√±os del Poder (1972) References External links * Official website * Biography at the National Senate Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Chiefs of Cabinet of Ministers of Argentina Category:Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies Category:Members of the Argentine Senate Category:Argentine journalists Category:Radical Civic Union politicians Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ","title":"Rodolfo Terragno"},{"id":"3898518","text":"Aqueduct may refer to: Bridges *Aqueduct (bridge), a bridge to convey water over an obstacle, such as a ravine or valley *Navigable aqueduct, or water bridge, a structure to carry navigable waterway canals over other rivers, valleys, railways or roads Water supply systems *Aqueduct (water supply), a watercourse constructed to convey water **Acequia, a community- operated watercourse used in Spain and former Spanish colonies in the Americas **Aryk, an artificial channel for redirecting water in Central Asia and other countries **Elan aqueduct carries water to Birmingham **Levada, an irrigation channel or aqueduct specific to the Portuguese island of Madeira **Puquios, underground water systems in Peru *Roman aqueduct, water supply systems constructed during the Roman Empire **Aqueduct of Segovia, a Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain Anatomy *Cerebral aqueduct in the brain *Vestibular aqueduct in the inner ear Other uses *Aqueduct (band), an indie pop band *Aqueduct (comics), a fictional character in Marvel Comics *Aqueduct Racetrack, a horse racing track and racino, located in New York City *Aqueduct Press, an American publisher *Aqueduct, California, former name of Monolith, California *Aqueduct, Shropshire, a village/suburb in Telford, Shropshire, England ","title":"Aqueduct"},{"id":"3898531","text":"Schematic representation of naked short selling in two steps. The short seller sells shares without owning them. They later purchase and deliver the shares for a different market price. If the short seller cannot afford the shares in the second step, or the shares are not available, a \\"fail to deliver\\" results. Naked short selling, or naked shorting, is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset of any kind without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed, as is conventionally done in a short sale. When the seller does not obtain the shares within the required time frame, the result is known as a \\"failure to deliver\\" (\\"FTD\\"). The transaction generally remains open until the shares are acquired by the seller, or the seller's broker settles the trade. Short selling is used to anticipate a price fall, but exposes the seller to the risk of a price rise. In 2008, the SEC banned what it called \\"abusive naked short selling\\" in the United States, as well as some other jurisdictions, as a method of driving down share prices. Failing to deliver shares is legal under certain circumstances, and naked short selling is not per se illegal. In the United States, naked short selling is covered by various SEC regulations which prohibit the practice. Critics, including Overstock.com's Patrick M. Byrne, have advocated for stricter regulations against naked short selling. In 2005, \\"Regulation SHO\\" was enacted; requiring that broker-dealers have grounds to believe that shares will be available for a given stock transaction, and requiring that delivery take place within a limited time period. According to data compiled by the SEC and Bloomberg, naked short selling of the shares of Lehman Brothers may have played a role in the North American Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. As part of its response to the crisis, the SEC issued a temporary order restricting short-selling in the shares of 19 financial firms deemed systemically important, by reinforcing the penalties for failing to deliver the shares in time.\\"Searching for the naked truth\\", The Economist, Aug 17, 2008 Effective September 18, 2008, amid claims that aggressive short selling had played a role in the failure of financial giant Lehman Brothers, the SEC extended and expanded the rules to remove exceptions and to cover all companies, including market makers. A 2014 study by researchers at the University at Buffalo, published in the Journal of Financial Economics, found no evidence that failure to deliver stock \\"caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis\\" and that \\"greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.\\" Some commentators have contended that despite regulations, naked shorting is widespread and that the SEC regulations are poorly enforced. Its critics have contended that the practice is susceptible to abuse, can be damaging to targeted companies struggling to raise capital, and has led to numerous bankruptcies. However, other commentators have said that the naked shorting issue is a \\"devil theory\\", not a bona fide market issue and a waste of regulatory resources. Description = \\"Normal\\" shorting = Short selling is a form of speculation that allows a trader to take a \\"negative position\\" in a stock of a company. Such a trader first \\"borrows\\" shares of that stock from their owner (the lender), typically via a bank or a prime broker under the condition that he will return it on demand. Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner. The buyer is typically unaware that the shares have been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds just as if the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader closes his short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender. The trader's profit is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares. In contrast to \\"going long\\" where sale succeeds the purchase, short sale precedes the purchase. Because the seller/borrower is generally required to make a cash deposit equivalent to the sale proceeds, it offers the lender some security. =Naked shorts in the United States= Naked short selling is a case of short selling without first arranging a borrow. If the stock is in short supply, finding shares to borrow can be difficult. The seller may also decide not to borrow the shares, in some cases because lenders are not available, or because the costs of lending are too high. When shares are not borrowed within the clearing time period and the short-seller does not tender shares to the buyer, the trade is considered to have \\"failed to deliver\\". Nevertheless, the trade will continue to sit open or the buyer may be credited the shares by the DTCC until the short-seller either closes out the position or borrows the shares. It is difficult to measure how often naked short selling occurs. Fails to deliver are not necessarily indicative of naked shorting, and can result from both \\"long\\" transactions (stock purchases) and short sales. Naked shorting can be invisible in a liquid market, as long as the short sale is eventually delivered to the buyer. However, if the covers are impossible to find, the trades fail. Fail reports are published regularly by the SEC, and a sudden rise in the number of fails- to-deliver will alert the SEC to the possibility of naked short selling. In some recent cases, it was claimed that the daily activity was larger than all of the available shares, which would normally be unlikely. Extent of naked shorting The reasons for naked shorting, and the extent of it, had been disputed for several years before the SEC's 2008 action to prohibit the practice. What is generally recognized is that naked shorting tends to happen when shares are difficult to borrow. Studies have shown that naked short selling also increases with the cost of borrowing . In recent years, a number of companies have been accused of using naked shorts in aggressive efforts to drive down share prices, sometimes with no intention of ever delivering the shares. These claims argue that, at least in theory, the practice allows an unlimited number of shares to be sold short. A Los Angeles Times editorial in July 2008 said that naked short selling \\"enables speculators to drive down a company's stock by offering an overwhelming number of shares for sale\\". The SEC has stated that naked shorting is sometimes falsely asserted as a reason for a share price decline, when, often, \\"the price decrease is a result of the company's poor financial situation rather than the reasons provided by the insiders or promoters.\\" Before 2008, regulators had generally downplayed the extent of naked shorting in the US. At a North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) conference on naked short selling in November 2005, an official of the New York Stock Exchange stated that NYSE had not found evidence of widespread naked short selling. In 2006, an official of the SEC said that \\"While there may be instances of abusive short selling, 99% of all trades in dollar value settle on time without incident.\\" Of all those that do not, 85% are resolved within 10 business days and 90% within 20. That means that about 1% of shares that change hands daily, or about $1 billion per day, are subject to delivery failures, although the SEC has stated that \\"fails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales\\", and accordingly that they do not necessarily indicate naked short selling. In 2008, SEC chairman Christopher Cox said that the SEC \\"has zero tolerance for abusive naked short-selling\\" while implementing new regulations to prohibit the practice, culminating in the September 2008 action following the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers amidst speculation that naked short selling had played a contributory role.\\"SEC Issues New Rules to Protect Investors Against Naked Short Selling Abuses\\", Press release, Securities and Exchange Commission, September 17, 2008 Cox said that \\"the rule would be designed to ensure transparency in short-selling in general, beyond the practice of naked short-selling.\\" Claimed effects of naked shorting As with the prevalence of naked shorting, the effects are contested. The SEC has stated that the practice can be beneficial in enhancing liquidity in difficult-to-borrow shares, while others have suggested that it adds efficiency to the securities lending market. Critics of the practice argue that it is often used for market manipulation, that it can damage companies and even that it threatens the broader markets. One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create \\"phantom\\" or \\"counterfeit\\" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and artificially depressing the share price. However, the SEC has disclaimed the existence of counterfeit shares and stated that naked short selling would not increase a company's outstanding shares. Short seller David Rocker contended that failure to deliver securities \\"can be done for manipulative purposes to create the impression that the stock is a tight borrow\\", although he said that this should be seen as a failure to deliver \\"longs\\" rather than \\"shorts\\". Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, and a consultant to a law firm suing over naked shorting, has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground. Richard Fuld, the former CEO of the financial firm Lehman Brothers, during hearings on the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform alleged that a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked short selling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to the collapse of both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.\\"Committee to Hold Hearings on Collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG\\" , October 03, 2008 testimony of Richard Fuld Fuld had been obsessed with short sellers and had even demoted those Lehman executives that dealt with them; he claimed that the short sellers and the rumour mongers had brought down Lehman, although he had no evidence of it. Upon the examination of the issue of whether \\"naked short selling\\" was in any way a cause of the collapse of Bear Stearns or Lehman, securities experts reached the conclusion that the alleged \\"naked short sales\\" occurred after the collapse and therefore played no role in it. House committee Chairman Henry Waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from Lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was \\"no accountability for failure\\". In July 2008, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox said there was no \\"unbridled naked short selling in financial issues\\". Regulations in the United States =Securities Exchange Act of 1934= The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 stipulates a settlement period up to two business days before a stock needs to be delivered, generally referred to as \\"T+2 delivery\\". =Regulation SHO= The SEC enacted Regulation SHO in January 2005 to target abusive naked short selling by reducing failure to deliver securities, and by limiting the time in which a broker can permit failures to deliver.\\"Key Points About Regulation SHO\\", Security and Exchange Commission In addressing the first, it stated that a broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order without having first borrowed or identified the stock being sold. The rule had the following exemptions: #Broker or dealer accepting a short sale order from another registered broker or dealer #Bona fide market making #Broker-dealer effecting a sale on behalf of a customer that is deemed to own the security pursuant to Rule 200 through no fault of the customer or the broker-dealer. To reduce the duration for which fails to deliver are permitted to sit open, the regulation requires broker-dealers to close out open fail-to-deliver positions in threshold securities that have persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days. The SEC, in describing Regulation SHO, stated that failures to deliver shares that persist for an extended period of time \\"may result in large delivery obligations where stock settlement occurs\\". Regulation SHO also created the \\"Threshold Security List\\", which reported any stock where more than 0.5% of a company's total outstanding shares failed delivery for five consecutive days. A number of companies have appeared on the list, including Krispy Kreme, Martha Stewart Omnimedia and Delta Air Lines. The Motley Fool, an investment website, observes that \\"when a stock appears on this list, it is like a red flag waving, stating 'something is wrong here!'\\" However, the SEC clarified that appearance on the threshold list \\"does not necessarily mean that there has been abusive naked short selling or any impermissible trading in the stock\\". In July 2006, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation SHO, to further reduce failures to deliver securities. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox referred to \\"the serious problem of abusive naked short sales, which can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price\\" and that the SEC is \\"concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO\\". =Developments, 2007 to the present= In June 2007, the SEC voted to remove the grandfather provision that allowed fails-to-deliver that existed before Reg SHO to be exempt from Reg SHO. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called naked short selling \\"a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish\\". The SEC also said it was considering removing an exemption from the rule for options market makers. Removal of the grandfather provision and naked shorting restrictions generally have been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In March 2008, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox gave a speech entitled the \\"'Naked' Short Selling Anti-Fraud Rule\\", in which he announced new SEC efforts to combat naked short selling.Video of Christopher Cox, March 2008 Under the proposal, the SEC would create an antifraud rule targeting those who knowingly deceive brokers about having located securities before engaging in short sales, and who fail to deliver the securities by the delivery date. Cox said the proposal would address concerns about short-selling abuses, particularly in the market for small-cap stocks. Even with the regulation in place, the SEC received hundreds of complaints in 2007 about alleged abuses involving short sales. The SEC estimated that about 1% of shares that changed hands daily, about $1 billion, were subject to delivery failures. SEC Commissioners Paul Atkins and Kathleen Casey expressed support for the crackdown.Judith A. Burns, \\"SEC Proposes Teeth for Short-Selling Rules\\", Wall Street Journal, March 5, 2008\\"SEC proposes tougher 'naked' short selling rules\\", March 4, 2008, Reuters In mid-July 2008, the SEC announced emergency actions to limit the naked short selling of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to limit market volatility of financial stocks. But even with respect to those stocks the SEC soon thereafter announced there would be an exception with regard to market makers.Ivy Schmerken, \\"SEC Short Sale Rule Could Create a Bubble in Financial Stocks\\", Wall Street & Technology, July 20, 2008 SEC Chairman Cox noted that the emergency order was \\"not a response to unbridled naked short selling in financial issues\\", saying that \\"that has not occurred\\". Cox said, \\"rather it is intended as a preventative step to help restore market confidence at a time when it is sorely needed.\\" Analysts warned of the potential for the creation of price bubbles. The emergency actions rule expired August 12, 2008. However, on September 17, 2008, the SEC issued new, more extensive rules against naked shorting, making \\"it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling\\". Among the new rules is that market makers are no longer given an exception. As a result, options market makers will be treated in the same way as all other market participants, and effectively will be banned from naked short selling.\\"SEC Issues New Rules to Protect Investors Against Naked Short Selling Abuses\\", Securities and Exchange Commission, September 17, 2008 On November 4, 2008, voters in South Dakota considered a ballot initiative, \\"The South Dakota Small Investor Protection Act\\", to end naked short selling in that state. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association of Washington and New York said they would take legal action if the measure passed.Sara Hansard, \\"SIFMA to sue if short-sale vote wins; Naked short selling on South Dakota ballot, InvestmentNews, November 2, 2008 The voters defeated the initiative. In July 2009, the SEC, under what the Wall Street Journal described as \\"intense political pressure\\", made permanent an interim rule that obliges brokerages to promptly buy or borrow securities when executing a short sale. The SEC said that since the fall of 2008, abusive naked short selling had been reduced by 50%, and the number of threshold list securities (equity securities with too many \\"fails to deliver\\") declined from 582 in July 2008 to 63 in March 2009. In January 2010, Mary Schapiro, chairperson of the SEC, testified before the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that fails to deliver in equity securities had declined 63.4 percent, while persistent and large fails had declined 80.5 percent. Regulations outside of the United States Several international exchanges have either partially or fully restricted the practice of naked short selling of shares. They include Australia's Australian Securities Exchange, India's Securities and Exchange Board, the Netherlands's Euronext Amsterdam, Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Switzerland's SWX Swiss Exchange. Also Spain's securities regulator CNMV. (restrictions adopted on 22 September 2008) In March 2007, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which disallowed short sales altogether in 2001 as a result of the Ketan Parekh affair, reintroduced short selling under regulations similar to those developed in the United States. In conjunction with this rule change, SEBI outlawed all naked short selling. Japan's naked shorting ban started on November 4, 2008, and was originally scheduled to run until July 2009, but was extended through October of that year. Japan's Finance Minister, Sh≈çichi Nakagawa stated, \\"We decided (to move up the short-selling ban) as we thought it could be dangerous for the Tokyo stock market if we do not take action immediately.\\" Nakagawa added that Japan's Financial Services Agency would be teaming with the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission and Tokyo Stock Exchange to investigate past violations of Japanese regulations on stock short-selling. The ban was subsequently extended through October 2010.\\"Japan to extend naked short selling ban to Oct.\\" July 26, 2010. Reuters. The Singapore Exchange started to penalize naked short sales with an interim measure in September, 2008. These initial penalties started at $100 per day. In November, they announced plans to increase the fines for failing to complete trades. The new penalties would penalize traders who fail to cover their positions, starting at $1,000 per day. There would also be fines for brokerages who fail to use the exchange's buying-in market to cover their positions, starting at $5,000 per day. The Singapore exchange had stated that the failure to deliver shares inherent in naked short sales threatened market orderliness. On May 18, 2010, the German Minister of Finance announced that naked short sales of euro-denominated government bonds, credit default swaps based on those bonds, and shares in Germany's ten leading financial institutions will be prohibited. This ban went into effect that night and was set to expire on March 31, 2011. On May 28, German financial market regulator BaFin announced that this ban would be permanent. The ban became effective July 27, 2010.Naked Short-Selling Ban Coming into Force in Germany, July 26, 2010. CNBC.com. The International Monetary Fund issued a report in August 2010 saying that the measure succeeded only in impeding the markets. It said the ban \\"did relatively little to support the targeted institutions‚Äô underlying stock prices, while liquidity dropped and volatility rose substantially.\\" The IMF said there was no strong evidence that stock prices fell because of shorting. In August 2011, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and South Korea temporally banned all short selling in their financial stocks, while Germany pushed for a eurozone-wide ban on naked short selling. Regulatory enforcement actions In 2005, the SEC notified Refco of intent to file an enforcement action against the securities unit of Refco for securities trading violations concerning the shorting of Sedona stock. The SEC sought information related to two former Refco brokers who handled the account of a client, Amro International, which shorted Sedona's stock. No charges had been filed by 2007. In December 2006, the SEC sued Gryphon Partners, a hedge fund, for insider trading and naked short-selling involving PIPEs in the unregistered stock of 35 companies. PIPEs are \\"private investments in public equities\\", used by companies to raise cash. The naked shorting took place in Canada, where it was legal at the time. Gryphon denied the charges. In March 2007, Goldman Sachs was fined $2 million by the SEC for allowing customers to illegally sell shares short prior to secondary public offerings. Naked short- selling was allegedly used by the Goldman clients. The SEC charged Goldman with failing to ensure those clients had ownership of the shares. SEC Chairman Cox said \\"That is an important case and it reflects our interest in this area.\\" In July 2007, Piper Jaffray was fined $150,000 by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Piper violated securities trading rules from January through May 2005, selling shares without borrowing them, and also failing to \\"cover short sales in a timely manner\\", according to the NYSE.\\"Monthly Disciplinary Actions ‚Äì July 2007 \\" , NYSE Regulation, July 11, 2007 At the time of this fine, the NYSE had levied over $1.9 million in fines for naked short sales over seven regulatory actions.Edgar Ortega, \\"Piper Fined by the NYSE Over Short-Sale Violations\\", Bloomberg News, July 11, 2007 Also in July 2007, the American Stock Exchange fined two options market makers for violations of Regulation SHO. SBA Trading was sanctioned for $5 million, and ALA Trading was fined $3 million, which included disgorgement of profits. Both firms and their principals were suspended from association with the exchange for five years. The exchange said the firms used an exemption to Reg. SHO for options market makers to \\"impermissibly engage in naked short selling\\". In October 2007, the SEC settled charges against New York hedge fund adviser Sandell Asset Management Corp. and three executives of the firm for, among other things, shorting stock without locating shares to borrow.

Some companies with falling stocks blame DTCC as the keeper of the system where it happens, and say DTCC turns a blind eye to the problem. Referring to trades that remain unsettled, DTCC's chief spokesman Stuart Goldstein said, \\"We're not saying there is no problem, but to suggest the sky is falling might be a bit overdone.\\" In July 2007, Senator Bennett suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling are \\"serious enough\\" that there should be a hearing on them with DTCC officials by the Senate Banking Committee, and that banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd has expressed a willingness to hold such a hearing.\\"Senator Bennett Discusses Naked Short Selling on the Senate Floor\\" , website of Senator Bennett, July 20, 2007, accessed 2009-02-21 Critics also contend DTCC has been too secretive with information about where naked shorting is taking place.

Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. \\\\--- F.3d ----, 2009 WL 579270 C.A.8 (Ark.),2009. Pet Quarters alleged the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.'s stock-borrow program resulted in the creation of nonexistent or phantom stock and contributed to the illegal short selling of the company's shares. The court ruled: \\"In short, all the damages that Pet Quarters claims to have suffered stem from activities performed or statements made by the defendants in conformity with the program's Commission approved rules. We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint on the basis of preemption.\\" Pet Quarters' complaint was almost identical to suits against DTCC brought by Whistler Investments Inc. and Nanopierce Technologies Inc. The suits also challenged DTCC's stock-borrow program, and were dismissed.\\"Court Rules Against Company Claiming Illegal Short Selling\\" by Carol Remond, Dow Jones News Service, March 11, 2009 Studies A study of trading in initial public offerings by two SEC staff economists, published in April 2007, found that excessive numbers of fails to deliver were not correlated with naked short selling. The authors of the study said that while the findings in the paper specifically concern IPO trading, \\"The results presented in this paper also inform a public debate surrounding the role of short selling and fails to deliver in price formation.\\" In contrast, a study by Leslie Boni in 2004 found correlation between \\"strategic delivery failures\\" and the cost of borrowing shares. The paper, which looked at a \\"unique dataset of the entire cross-section of U.S. equities\\", credited the initial recognition of strategic delivery fails to Richard Evans, Chris Geczy, David Musto and Adam Reed, and found its review to provide evidence consistent with their hypothesis that \\"market makers strategically fail to deliver shares when borrowing costs are high.\\" A study by Autore, Boulton, and Braga-Alves examined stock returns around delivery failures between 2005 and 2008 and found evidence consistent with a positive link between delivery failures and borrowing costs. An April 2007 study conducted for Canadian market regulators by Market Regulation Services Inc. found that fails to deliver securities were not a significant problem on the Canadian market, that \\"less than 6% of fails resulting from the sale of a security involved short sales\\" and that \\"fails involving short sales are projected to account for only 0.07% of total short sales. A Government Accountability Office study, released in June 2009, found that recent SEC rules had apparently reduced abusive short selling, but that the SEC needed to give clearer guidance to the brokerage industry. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, appointed by Congress to investigate the 2008 financial crisis, makes no reference to naked shorting, or short-selling of financial stocks, in its conclusions.FCIC Reports A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs \\"caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis\\". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that \\"greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.\\"What Caused 2008 Financial Crisis Cityam.com Media coverage Some journalists have expressed concern about naked short selling, while others contend that naked short selling is not harmful and that its prevalence has been exaggerated by corporate officials seeking to blame external forces for internal problems with their companies. Others have discussed naked short selling as a confusing or bizarre form of trading.Alex Blumberg (editor),\\"Catch It This Weekend: 'Naked Short Selling'\\", NPR, September 12, 2006 In June 2007, executives of Universal Express, which had claimed naked shorting of its stock, were sanctioned by a federal court judge for violation of securities laws. Referring to a court ruling against CEO Richard Altomare, New York Times columnist Floyd Norris said: \\"In Altomare's view, the issues that bothered the judge are irrelevant. Long and short of it, this is a naked short hallmark case in the making. Or it is proof that it can take a long time for the SEC to stop a fraud.\\"Floyd Norris, \\"A Sad Tale of Fictional SEC Filings\\", The New York Times, June 22, 2007 Universal Express claimed that 6,000 small companies had been put out of business by naked shorting, which the company said \\"the SEC has ignored and condoned.\\"\\"Universal Express statement\\" (pdf), June 28, 2007 (archived 2009) Reviewing the SEC's July 2008 emergency order, Barron's said in an editorial: \\"Rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission, Cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short- selling. It made a big noise, but there's no dead bug.\\" Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal said the order was \\"an exercise in symbolic confidence- building\\" and that naked shorting involved technical concerns except for subscribers to a \\"devil theory\\". The Economist said the SEC had \\"picked the wrong target\\", mentioning a study by Arturo Bris of the Swiss International Institute for Management Development who found that trading in the 19 financial stocks became less efficient. The Washington Post expressed approval of the SEC's decision to address a \\"frenetic shadow world of postponed promises, borrowed time, obscured paperwork and nail-biting price-watching, usually compressed into a few high-tension days swirling around the decline of a company\\". The Los Angeles Times called the practice of naked short selling \\"hard to defend\\", and stated that it was past time the SEC became active in addressing market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial in July 2008 that \\"the Beltway is shooting the messenger by questioning the price-setting mechanisms for barrels of oil and shares of stock.\\" But it said the emergency order to bar naked short selling \\"won't do much harm\\", and said \\"Critics might say it's a solution to a nonproblem, but the SEC doesn't claim to be solving a problem. The Commission's move is intended to prevent even the possibility that an unscrupulous short seller could drive down the shares of a financial firm with a flood of sell orders that aren't backed by an actual ability to deliver the shares to buyers.\\" In an article in March 2009 Bloomberg News Service said that the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy may have been prevented by curbs on naked shorting. \\"..as many as 32.8 million shares in the company were sold and not delivered to buyers on time as of Sept. 11, according to data compiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission..\\" In May 2009, the New York Times chief financial correspondent Floyd Norris reported that naked shorting is \\"almost gone\\". He said that delivery failures, where they occur, are quickly corrected. In an article published in October 2009, Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi contended that Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were flooded with \\"counterfeit stock\\" that helped kill both companies. Taibbi said that the two firms got a \\"push\\" into extinction from \\"a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling\\". Cf. p.53: \\"But the most damning thing the attack on Bear had in common with these earlier manipulations was the employment of a type of counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling. From the moment the confidential meeting at the Fed ended on March 11th, Bear became the target of this ostensibly illegal practice ‚Äì and the companies widely rumored to be behind the assault were in that room.\\" During a May 2010 discussion on the inclusion of \\"counterfeiting\\" in the charges filed against Icelandic bankers, the host Max Keiser speculated that the charge might refer to naked short selling because \\"naked short-selling is the same as counterfeiting, in that it is selling something that doesn't exist.\\" A 2014 study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics, found no evidence that fails contributed to \\"price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis\\".

Biography Brown was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Her parents were Joseph Miller Brown (1867-1942), and his wife, Rosa Elizabeth Rumming (1872-1960). She wrote her first poem at the age of six years. In 1944, she was the first female poet awarded the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal. In 1967, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for her contributions to Canadian poetry\\". After about 1950, literary history suddenly dropped Brown from the poetic canon. Despite the accolades, the awards, and the best wishes of those who early on championed her work, and particularly Toronto professor Pelham Edgar‚Äîand those who may have played upon the fact that she was crippled by rheumatic fever‚Äîshe was side-lined by modernism and professional literary critics. She was aware of what was happening, but helpless to stop it. Her failing, she claimed, was that she had no real experience of life. She was a personal friend of the Canadian poet and civil servant Duncan Campbell Scott late in his life, and he was influential in introducing Pelham Edgar to her poems. Brown was freelance journalist for the Nanaimo Free Press starting in 1926 and often used the pseudonym the Khoji. Brown was a 2018 Culture & Heritage Award recipient for Lifetime Cultural Achievement from the City of Nanaimo. She died in Victoria, BC. A very complete archive of her works, manuscripts, and unpublished material is in the Special Collections of the University of Victoria.

Background  The Act was brought in after a referendum was held under the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Act 1998 (c. 3). The referendum question was: 'Are you in favour of the Government's proposals for a Greater London Authority, made up of an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly?' The Yes vote was 72.01%, the No vote was 27.99%.  Provisions  Apart from the main provisions creating the authority and transferring powers to it, it also created a Metropolitan Police Authority for the Metropolitan Police Service, and consequently altered the borders of the Metropolitan Police District to be coterminous with Greater London (excluding the City). The Act comprises 425 Sections in 12 Parts including 22 named Chapters and 34 Schedules. It was the longest Act to be passed by Parliament since the Government of India Act 1935. The 12 Parts of the Act were: * Part I The Greater London Authority - Sections 1 to 29 * Part II General Functions and Procedure - Sections 30 to 80 * Part III Financial Provisions - Sections 81 to 140 * Part IV Transport - Sections 141 to 303 * Part V The London Development Agency - Sections 304 to 309 * Part VI Police and Probation Services - Sections 310 to 327 * Part VII The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority - Sections 328 to 333 * Part VIII Planning - Sections 334 to 350 * Part IX Environmental Functions - Sections 351 to 374 * Part X Culture, Media and Sport - Sections 375 to 386 * Part XI Miscellaneous and General Provisions - Sections 387 to 404 * Part XII Supplementary Provisions - Sections 405 to 425  Amendments  The Act was amended by the Greater London Authority Act 2007 (2007 c. 24) entitled 'An Act to make further provision with respect to the Greater London Authority; to amend the Greater London Authority Act 1999; to make further provision with respect to the functional bodies, within the meaning of that Act, and the Museum of London; and for connected purposes.'

Evolution Borophagus, like other borophagines, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Description Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; Borophagus has been considered to be probably a scavenger by paleontologists in the past. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. However, Borophagus fossils are so abundant and geographically widespread that some paleontologists now argue that Borophagus must have been both the dominant carnivore of its time, and thus an active predator because carrion feeding alone could not have sustained such a large population.Wang, Xiaoming; and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. pp112-3 They note that not all carnivores with bone-cracking ability are scavengers, such as the modern spotted hyena; instead, they interpret the bone-cracking ability as an adaptation to social hunting where complete utilization of a carcass was favored. Coprolites from Borophagus further vindicate its bone-crushing abilities, while simultaneously indicating it occupied a niche no longer seen in the present-day ecosystems of North America. The discovery of these coprolites also indicates that Borophagus may have been a social pack-hunter.https://elifesciences.org/articles/34773 The adult animal is estimated to have been about 80 cm in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Species Restoration by Charles R. Knight, 1902 *Borophagus diversidens existed for (synonymous with Felis hillianus, Hyaenognathus matthewi, Hyaenognathus pachyodon, Hyaenognathus solus, Porthocyon dubius) *Borophagus dudleyi existed for *Borophagus hilli existed for (synonymous with Osteoborus crassapineatus, Osteoborus progressus) *Borophagus littoralis existed for (syn.

(1999). Paleoecology In North America, in places such as Coffee Ranch in Texas, Borophagus was contemporary with the bear Agriotherium as well as the feliform Barbourofelis, the saber-toothed machairodont cat Amphimachairodus coloradensis and fellow canid Epicyon. All of these animals were potential competitors that would have occasionally conflicted with Borophagus for food and territory, though it may also have readily scavenged their kills. Prey for Borophagus included herbivores like the camel Aepycamelus, the pronghorn antelope Cosoryx, horses like Neohipparion and Nannippus, the ancient peccary Prosthennops and even rhinoceroses like the hippo-like Teleoceras, all of which could provide a suitable meal through hunting or scavenging.

In cave geology, boxwork is an uncommon type of mineral structure, or speleogen (similar to a speleothem, but formed by erosion rather than accretion), occasionally found in caves and erosive environments. In mining geology, boxwork refers to quartz-lined cavities retaining the shape of the dissolved ore minerals in gossans. Caves According to KellerLynn, \\"Boxwork is a speleogen, forming when bedrock between preexisting calcite veins were preferentially weathered away as the cave developed.\\" Boxwork is commonly composed of thin blades of the mineral calcite that project from cave walls or ceilings that intersect one another at various angles, forming a box-like or honeycomb pattern. The boxwork fins once filled cracks in the rock before the host cave formed. As the walls of the cave began to dissolve away, the more resistant vein and crack fillings did not, or at least dissolved at a slower rate than the surrounding rock, leaving the calcite fins projecting from the cave surfaces. Some of the most extensive boxwork deposits in the world are found in Wind Cave, Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, US. Other outstanding examples occur in Cody Caves, Cody Caves Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada. Boxwork can also be seen at Jewel Cave National Monument (near Wind Cave), and at Innerspace Caverns near Georgetown, Texas.

Opened in 1988 as Cedar Knoll Galleria, the mall struggled to keep tenants for several years, eventually becoming a dead mall. Starting in 2005, however, redevelopment began on the property, and customer traffic has increased. Dining choices are My Dad's Pizza and Callihan's. The mall's anchor stores are Kyova 10 Theatre and Rural King. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Sears and Elder-Beerman. History The mall opened in October 1989 as the Cedar Knoll Galleria. It was developed by Zamias Services, Inc., on the site of a former golf course (whose namesake the mall took). Approximately in size, the mall was originally anchored by Sears, Stone & Thomas, Phar-Mor, and Kmart; plans for the mall included space for a theater in the rear, as well as another anchor store. Stone & Thomas would later convert to Elder-Beerman as the former chain was purchased. Even though Cedar Knoll Galleria was located near Interstate 64, it was not very convenient for Ashland residents, who preferred Ashland Town Center, located closer to downtown Ashland. As a result, Cedar Knoll languished for many years, struggling to keep spaces leased. Some spaces were never leased, creating noticeable gaps between stores. Also leading to the mall's demise was the opening of a Walmart Supercenter in 1994 roughly a mile away from the mall, drawing from the mall's customer base. In 2001, the mall's Italian Oven restaurant closed, as it was discovered that the restaurant could not legally serve alcohol. By 2001, the mall's food court would be devoid of restaurants. Kmart's bankruptcy filings in 2002 resulted in the closure of the mall's Kmart location; Phar-Mor would close the same year, also as part of bankruptcy. =Kyova Mall= In 2005, Eggleston Associates of Cincinnati, Ohio, purchased the mall from its original developer. Shortly thereafter, a new plan for the mall was developed; Eggleston also renamed the mall Kyova Mall. A new roof was also installed, which included repairs to the central segment of the shopping center, as it was in bad condition. Talks began again for a movie theatre in the slot where one had originally been planned. Steve & Barry's opened in the old Kmart in 2005. On May 11, 2006, plans were announced to add a new movie theater complex to the mall; within a year, it had been confirmed that Phoenix Theatres would open a location in the former Phar-Mor. as Phoenix had more experience in retrofitting theateres into existing retail big-box stores The 10-screen theater, which opened in May 2007, includes high- back \\"stadium seating\\" chairs, making it the second theater in the region to feature stadium seating. Since the opening of the theater, the mall has seen a significant increase in traffic, although only 21% of its smaller shop space is occupied. The Phoenix Theatre was later renamed to KYOVA 10 Theatre. On May 22, 2007 voters in Boyd County approved alcohol sales in the county by a 67% margin; all but one precinct voted in favor. The law would allow alcohol to be served in restaurants that seat at least 100 people that have food sales as 70% of total revenue. The measure, pushed by the management at the mall in order to boost business and attract new restaurants, went to ballot after 6,000 signatures were signed in support. Steve & Barry's closed in September 2008. September 2008, Wilma's Dress Shop, featuring bridal and formal wear, opened and Knot Just Pretzels joined the mall food court. In November 2008, Sophia's opened featuring makeovers, clothing, accessories and Lee Middleton Dolls. In December 2008, RJ Kahuna's Sports Bar & Grill opened. In January 2009, Custom Metal Creations opened after coming into the mall as a holiday shop. Chris' Gyros joined the food court leaving one vacancy and Summit Brokerage Services opened. Dollar Tree opened in February 2009. T-Bird's Diner opened in early 2010 in the food court. The Treasure Chest has been open and been in the mall since April 2009. In October 2010, the Ashland Table Tennis Club (ATTC) began utilizing the former Radio Shack store space.http://dailyindependent.com/local/x1507930264/Pingpong-passion In February 2014, it was announced that Sears would be closing, one of the mall's original anchor stores.http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/x262021196/Sears- to-close-at-Kyova-Mall After a three-month liquidation, the store officially closed in May 2014.

History  Infomed staff gather in the Infomed lobby on the day of the worldwide challenge for health. Infomed started in 1992 as a project to interconnect the information centers and the medical libraries in Cuba, and it is today a network with national reach. The project has received awards and international recognition, in particular the Stockholm Challenge Award in 2002. It is a network of people and institutions that share the purpose of facilitating access to information and knowledge to improve the health of the Cuban people and other people of the World, by intensive and creative use of the information and communication technologies. The first international steps of this network were participating in a project of the Pan-American Health Organization and the National Library of Medicine of the USA to access MEDLINE with the help of e-mail through the project BITNIS. The network started as an initiative of the Medical Sciences Information National Center, that was founded in 1965 to take care of the information needs of doctors and other health workers. A characteristic of the project has been the use of the information and communication technologies with a social vision and with the developments of local capabilities. It was the first national network in utilizing the Linux operating system in all its servers for the development of national content and adequate services to its health system. Since 1994 it has placed the complete texts of the Cuban medical magazines in internet and encouraged the development of specialized sites in the most diverse subjects of the medical sciences and public health. It provides the users with an opportune and efficient access to quality scientific and technical information assistance, administration, education and research in health, turning them in active producers of information and knowledge. It offers content and services with high aggregate value and ruled by quality standards with the goal of offering to the user the necessary information to satisfy his or her needs.  Development  The network has tens of thousands of users in Cuba and its portal is visited by many users from around the world. The network is composed of libraries and units of information that cover all health areas in the country. It has worked with the model of at least one library in each area of health. The Virtual Library of Health, (BVS in Spanish)] that is part of the Virtual Libraries of Health of Latin America and the Caribbean; promoted by BIREME, that is the Health Information Center of Latin America and Caribbean, based in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the Pan-American Health Organization and the World Health Organization. It also has the Cuban Virtual University of Health, a virtual convention center, sites of medical specialties and many other services, such as, directories, bibliographic data bases, health statistics, a collection of lectures and presentations of specialized subjects, diagnostic discussions, inquiries services to experts and other services. Infomed‚Äôs Portal consists of a network of specialized portals of medical sciences and health subjects that are maintained by groups of specialists, scientific societies and libraries and institutional, municipal and provincial information centers. It also offers a daily health news service and specialized information services.  Sources of information  Among Infomed‚Äôs most important information sources is the collection of the complete text of the main Cuban Medical Journals. An important group of them form the collection Scielo Cuba that is part of the Virtual Library of Health. The Virtual Library of Health also has an important collection of books of medical sciences and health published by Cuban authors.  Publications  The Journal of Medical Internet Research, recognized Infomed as a model for integration of health care information with research, education and the provision of services. The applicability of the Cuban model in other nations is recognized, within the context of varying ideological and social structures.S√©ror AC. A Case Analysis of INFOMED: The Cuban National Health Care Telecommunications Network and Portal. J Med Internet Res 2006;8(1):e1 URL: http://www.jmir.org/2006/1/e1 DOI: 10.2196/jmir.8.1.e1  Infomed 2.0 Project  Infomed 2.0 is the name that synthesizes the proposal to move to a new phase of the development of the network that is supported by the collective work of its members. The name was inspired by the concept of Web 2.0 that incorporates the technological, organizational and cultural changes that are being produced in the Internet and particularly in the Web. Since its beginnings Infomed was conceived and developed under the concept of a decentralized model of collective construction. Evidence of this is the development of nodes in all the provinces, the creation of territorial domains, the development of sites and Web pages at all levels, the sustained incorporation of users and the wide production of content and services during times when blogs, wikis and other present forms of communication did not exist and that today represent the idea of Web 2.0. The development of the network of sites of specialties is an example of this type and the existence of pages of professionals and other groups are important antecedents of what today people are seeking to develop. For these reasons Infomed tries to develop a health ecosystem of people, services and sources of information supported by products and services of information, communication and excellent collaboration, centered on our users and built with their active participation. To that effect have the opportunities that offer a set of technological tools and ways to operate the web that will mean a change in the conditions of which stands out the increasing simplification to access technology and the increasing importance of the roll of people and the ways of work in teams and collectives. Although there are still pending important investment in infrastructure and communications, these are problems that will be solved in the short and medium term. However, the most important challenge is on the side of human resources. It has been proposed to start designing, implementing and maintaining services aligned with the Infomed 2.0 philosophy. The models are a base, a reference, not a scheme. Each person that uses them must help create or generate new models, continuously improve the existing ones and provide feedback for its use in practice.

He was capped 54 times for Norway, scoring 13 goals and he is regarded as one of the best Norwegian players of his generation. He later coached Bryne and Viking. Club career √òkland was born in B√∏mlo and began his career at the local club Bremnes before he moved to Vard Haugesund in the early 1970s. In 1976 the club played their sole season in the Norwegian top division and √òkland scored 11 goals, and made his international debut the same year. Despite √òkland's efforts, Vard were relegated at the end of the season, and he then transferred to Bryne. With √òkland as one of the key players, the newly promoted Bryne survived relegation in 1977, finished fourth in 1979 and second in 1980. In the summer of 1980, he was signed by West German side Bayer Leverkusen. √òkland enjoyed a successful three-year spell at Leverkusen. Just a few months into his stay at the club, he scored a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì0 win against Bayern Munich. √òkland was in fact credited with a fourth goal late in the game as the ball went through a hole in the side netting, but √òkland famously told the referee that it wasn't a goal. In his three years at Leverkusen, √òkland played 101 Bundesliga matches and scored 43 goals. In 1983, √òkland moved to the French team Racing Club de Paris, where he spent two seasons before returning to Bryne. In his second spell at Bryne, √òkland helped the club win the only major trophy in their history; the Norwegian Cup in 1987. After this victory, √òkland retired. International career √òkland was one of the key players in Tor R√∏ste Fossen's period as national team coach. He made his debut against Spain on 29 March 1978, which also was R√∏ste Fossen first match in charge of Norway. His first international goals came in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Belgium, in a UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying match on 20 September 1978. He soon became an important player in both the national team, and the Olympic team. Norway qualified for the Moscow Olympics, but because of the boycott √òkland and other teammates like Einar Aas and Vidar Davidsen never got to play in the olympics. √òkland was also a part of Norway's famous win against England in 1981, when Bj√∏rge Lillelien commented his now famous \\"Your boys took a hell of a beating\\" tirade. Norway performed well in the start of the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifiers, and with √òkland scoring in both matches, Norway won 3‚Äì1 against Yugoslavia and drew 2‚Äì2 away against Bulgaria, but with Tom Lund retiring from football, Norway once again failed to qualify for the finals. In 1985, √òkland scored the winning goal when Norway won 2‚Äì1 against reigning world champions Italy. √òkland was also a part of the team that won 1‚Äì0 against future world champions Argentina in 1986. His last international appearance was in a friendly match against Italy on 28 May 1987, the same year as he retired. In total, √òkland was capped 54 times, scoring 13 goals. Coaching career He was later head coach of Bryne and Viking and was Norway's assistant coach during 1994 FIFA World Cup. Life outside football √òkland has later been CEO of Dolly Dimple's, a Norwegian pizza chain. He was the director of Viking, a Norwegian football club from Stavanger, between 2012 and 2015. √òkland is married to Liv Brit √òkland, and they have three children; St√•le √òkland, Silvia √ò.

Formerly a daily newspaper, the Tribune resulted from the combination of local newspapers acquired by Cox Enterprises: The Tempe Daily News, the Mesa Tribune, the Gilbert Tribune, the Scottsdale Progress, and the Chandler Arizonan.  History  Attorney Alfred P. Shewman and Judge W.D. Morton founded Mesa's first newspaper, the Evening Weekly Free Press, in 1891. In 1899, Judge W.D. Morton sold out to Shewman, who died in 1901. Frank T. Pomeroy and Harry D. Haines bought the paper in 1910 and converted it into a daily publication, The Evening Press. They then sold the paper in 1911. In 1913, The Evening Press became the Mesa Daily Tribune, and in 1925, the paper was renamed the Mesa Daily Journal. The name changed again to the Daily Mesa Evening Journal in 1928. In 1932, Southside Publishing Company, a corporation of Mesa and Chandler businessmen, acquired ownership. Over the next 7 years, stock was purchased by P.R. Mitten and his son, Charles until 1939 when Charles Mitten bought out his father's share. Mitten began printing the paper five days a week after World War II under the name of the Mesa Daily Tribune. In 1950 Mitten sold the paper to David W. Calvert. In 1952, the Tribune Publishing Company was incorporated. On January 26, 1956, the Mesa Daily Tribune publishing plant on Macdonald Street was destroyed by fire and opened five months later at 120 W. 1st Ave, Mesa. In 1977, Cox Enterprises of Atlanta, Georgia, purchased the Mesa Daily Tribune from Calvert. Cox Newspapers then purchased the Tempe Daily News in 1980 and the Chandler Arizonan in 1983. It started the Gilbert Tribune in 1990, and purchased the Scottsdale Progress in 1993. David C. Scott was appointed president of Cox Arizona Publications and publisher of the Mesa Tribune in 1986, succeeding Roger Kintzel. In December 1996, Cox Newspapers sold its newspaper holdings to Thomson Newspapers. In May 1997, under the leadership of its publisher, Karen Wittmer, all five newspapers were combined into one newspaper, The Tribune. The paper served eastern Maricopa County with a Scottsdale edition for the northern communities. In December 1997, the Daily News-Sun in Sun City, Arizona, joined the Tribune as part of its Phoenix SMG (Strategic Marketing Group). The Ahwatukee Foothills News, which covered news on the southeastern border of Phoenix, joined in November 1998. In December 1999, The Tribune was renamed the East Valley Tribune and, in August 2000, Thomson Newspapers sold its Arizona newspaper holdings to Freedom Communications, Inc. of Irvine, California On October 6, 2008, publisher Julie Moreno announced that, as of 2009, the newspaper would cease publishing in Scottsdale and Tempe. Additionally, it would publish only four days a week in the remainder of its circulation area, although it would publish four distinct editions serving Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert and Queen Creek. More than 140 staff members' jobs were eliminated with the move. On April 20, 2009, the Tribune was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting after the paper ran a five- part series on how the efforts of Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio against illegal immigrants detracted from quality of law enforcement services provided by his agency. By the time the award was announced, co-author of the series Paul Giblin had been laid off during a round of Tribune cutbacks and co-author Ryan Gabrielson left the following summer. Freedom Communications filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on September 1, 2009, in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware. As a result, on November 2, 2009, the East Valley Tribune announced that it would cease operations on December 31, 2009. However, a new buyer was found, and the Tribune, the Daily News-Sun, the Ahwatukee Foothills News, Glendale/Peoria Today and Surprise Today were sold to 10/13 Communications LLC, an affiliate of Boulder, Colorado-based Thirteenth Street Media. The transaction was approved by the bankruptcy judge in March 2010, as part of Freedom's reorganization process. The Tribune continued operations while the sale was pending. 10/13 Communications already owned a free-distribution weekly called the Explorer, serving Oro Valley and Marana in north suburban Tucson. On October 8, 2011, Terry Horne was named publisher and editor of the East Valley Tribune. Between 2011 and 2016, the Tribune scaled back its publication schedule from four days a week to three days (Wednesday, Friday and Sunday), then to two days (Wednesday and Sunday), and finally to just a Sunday Edition. In late January 2016, Scottsdale-based Times Media Group, established by entrepreneur Steve Strickbine in 1997 and the owner of 15 local community news publications including College Times, Scottsdale Airpark News and the website Phoenix.org, acquired the East Valley Tribune and Ahwatukee Foothills News from 10/13 Communications. Times Media Group immediately assumed day-to-day operations; 10/13's other Arizona community newspapers were not included in the sale. Today, the East Valley Tribune publishes once a week on Sunday with a circulation of more than 140,000 copies and more than 405,000 weekly readers. Eighty-five percent of the newspapers are delivered directly to the driveways of East Valley families, while the remaining 15 percent are distributed at high-traffic locations and outlets.

The conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia, as part of the Coal Wars, a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Up to 100 people were killed, and many more arrested. The United Mine Workers saw major declines in membership, but the long-term publicity led to some improvements in working conditions. For five days from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers (called the Logan Defenders) who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields when tensions rose between workers and mine management. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were firedAyers, Rothrock and King 2007 and the United States Army, represented by the West Virginia Army National Guard led by McDowell County native William Eubanks, intervened by presidential order.Proclamation 1606, August 30, 1921  Background  Since the founding of the United Mine Workers union in 1890, coal mines in Mingo County, West Virginia and its surrounds hired only non-union workers, and strictly enforced employment contracts that included union membership as grounds for immediate termination. As miners in the area lived almost exclusively in company towns, termination also meant eviction. In 1920, the UMW's new president John L. Lewis sought to finally end the three-decade resistance to unionization in the area. He was under increased pressure to do so from both miners elsewhere participating in the United Mine Workers coal strike of 1919, and from affected mine operators who were now being outcompeted by the nonunion mines in West Virginia. This unionization push included efforts from Mother Jones, who gave fiery speeches at the age of 83, and Frank Keeney, president of the local union district. Over 3000 Mingo County miners joined the union ‚Äî and were summarily fired. The coal companies then hired agents of the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency to evict the families of their former employees. On May 19, 1920, a dozen Baldwin-Felts detectives, including Lee Felts, arrived in Matewan and connected with Lee‚Äôs brother Albert Felts. Albert and Lee were the brothers of Thomas Felts, the co-owner and director of the private detective agency. Albert had already been in the area and had tried to bribe Mayor Cabell Testerman with $500 to place machine guns on roofs in the town; Testerman refused. That afternoon Albert and Lee along with 11 other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Co. property. The first family they evicted was a woman and her children; the woman's husband was not home at the time. They forced them out at gunpoint and threw their belongings in the road under a light but steady rain. The miners who saw it were furious, and sent word to town. left As the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief Sid Hatfield and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest. Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, Mayor Testerman exclaimed, \\"This is a bogus warrant.\\" With these words, a gunfight erupted and Chief Hatfield shot the agent Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed (three from the town and seven from the agency). This gunfight became known as the Matewan Massacre, and its symbolic significance was enormous for the miners. The seemingly invincible detective agency Baldwin-Felts had been beaten. Chief Sid Hatfield became an immediate legend and hero to the union miners, and a symbol of hope that the oppression of coal operators and their hired guns could be overthrown. Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1920 the union gained strength in Mingo County, as did the resistance of the coal operators. Low- intensity warfare was waged up and down the Tug River. In late June state police under the command of Captain Brockus raided the Lick Creek tent colony near Williamson. Miners were said to have fired on Brockus and Martin's men from the colony, and in response the state police shot and arrested miners, ripped the canvas tents to shreds and scattered the mining families' belongings. Both sides were bolstering their arms, and Sid Hatfield continued to be a problem, especially when he converted Testerman's jewelry store into a gun shop. right On January 26, 1921, the trial of Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. It was in the national spotlight and brought much attention to the miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. He posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks. Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of yellow-dog contracts by ex- strikers returning to the mines. In mid-May 1921 union miners launched a full- scale assault on non-union mines. In a short time the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This \\"Three Days Battle\\" was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law. From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as one-sided. Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those on the side of \\"law and order\\" were seen as immune. The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence. left In the midst of this tense situation, Hatfield traveled to McDowell County on August 1, 1921 to stand trial on charges of dynamiting a coal tipple. Along with him traveled a good friend, Ed Chambers, and their wives. As they walked up the courthouse stairs, unarmed and flanked by their wives, a group of Baldwin-Felts agents standing at the top of the stairs opened fire. Hatfield was killed instantly. Chambers was bullet-riddled and rolled to the bottom of the stairs. Despite Sally Chambers' protests, one of the agents ran down the stairs and shot Chambers once more, point-blank in the back of the head. Hatfield's and Chambers' bodies were returned to Matewan, and word of the slayings spread through the mountains. The miners were angry at the way Hatfield had been slain, and that it appeared the assassins would escape punishment. They began to pour out of the mountains and take up arms. Miners along the Little Coal River were among the first to militarize, and began actions such as patrolling and guarding the area. Sheriff Don Chafin sent Logan County troopers to the Little Coal River area, where armed miners captured the troopers, disarmed them and sent them fleeing. On August 7, 1921, the leaders of the United Mine Workers (UMW) District 17, which encompasses much of southern West Virginia, called a rally at the state capitol in Charleston. These leaders were Frank Keeney and Fred Mooney, who were veterans of previous mine conflicts in the region. Both were local, well-read and articulate. Keeney and Mooney met with Governor Ephraim Morgan and presented him with a petition of the miners' demands. When Morgan summarily rejected the demands, the miners became more restless and began to talk of a march on Mingo to free the confined miners, end martial law and organize the county. But Blair Mountain, Logan County, and Sheriff Chafin stood directly in the way.  Battle  left At a rally on August 7, Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones called on the miners not to march into Logan and Mingo counties and set up the union by force. Accused by some of losing her nerve, she feared a bloodbath in a battle between lightly armed union forces and the more heavily armed Logan County deputies. Yet, feeling Morgan had lied to them again, armed men began gathering at Lens Creek Mountain, near Marmet in Kanawha County, on August 20. Four days later an estimated 13,000 had gathered and began marching towards Logan County. Impatient to get to the fighting, miners near St. Albans, in Kanawha County, commandeered a Chesapeake and Ohio freight train, renamed by the miners the Blue Steel Special, to meet up with the advanced column of marchers at Danville in Boone County on their way to \\"Bloody Mingo\\". During this time Keeney and Mooney fled to Ohio, while the fiery Bill Blizzard assumed quasi-leadership of the miners. Meanwhile, the anti-union Sheriff ChafinThe Herald-Dispatch: Funeral Rites Thursday For Colorful Don Chafin. August 10, 1954 had begun to set up defenses on Blair Mountain. He was supported financially by the Logan County Coal Operators Association, creating the nation's largest private armed force of nearly 2,000. right The first skirmishes occurred on the morning of August 25. The bulk of the miners were still away. The following day, President Warren Harding threatened to send in federal troops and Army Martin MB-1 bombers. After a long meeting in Madison, the seat of Boone County, the miners were convinced to return home. But the struggle was far from over. After spending days assembling his private army, Chafin would not be denied his battle to end union attempts at organizing Logan County coal mines. Within hours of the Madison decision, rumors abounded that Chafin's men had shot union sympathizers in the town of Sharples, just north of Blair Mountainand that families had been caught in crossfire during the skirmishes. Infuriated, the miners turned back toward Blair Mountain, many traveling in other stolen and commandeered trains. Political cartoon with left By August 29 battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private planes were hired to drop homemade bombs on the miners. A combination of poison gas and explosive bombs left over from World War I were dropped in several locations near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. At least one did not explode and was recovered by the miners; it was used months later to great effect as evidence for the defense during treason and murder trials. On orders from General Billy Mitchell, Army bombers from Maryland were also used for aerial surveillance. One Martin bomber crashed on its return flight, killing the three crew members. On August 30, Morgan appointed Colonel William Eubanks of the West Virginia National Guard to command the government and volunteer forces confronting the miners.The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising By Robert Shogan Sporadic gun battles continued for a week, with the miners at one time nearly breaking through to the town of Logan and their target destinations, the non-unionized counties to the south, Logan and Mingo. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50‚Äì100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured or wounded. Chafin's forces consisted of 90 men from Bluefield, West Virginia; 40 from Huntington, West Virginia; and about 120 from the West Virginia State Police.West Virginia Coal Fields: Hearings Before the Committee on Education and ....\\" p. 995 Testimony of Arnold Jackson, Superintedant of the West Virginia State Police testimony Three of Chafin's forces, two volunteers and a deputy sheriff, were killedGettysburg Times September 1, 1921Odmp memorial John GoreFrom 1920 to 1921 3 members of the West Virginia State Police were also killedWest Virginia Coal Fields: Hearings Before the Committee on Education and ...\\". p. 996 testimony of Jackson Arnold Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police that he knew of two dead men at Blair Mountain and that a third man had been found dead in the woods at Blair Mountain and one miner was fatally wounded.Schenectady Gazette June 19, 1922 Federal troops arriving in Blair, WVa and beginning to unload supplies. Federal troops arrived by September 2. Realizing he would lose a lot of good miners if the battle continued with the military, Bill Blizzard passed the word for the miners to start heading home the following day. Miners fearing jail and confiscation of their guns found clever ways to hide rifles and handguns in the woods before leaving Logan County. Collectors and researchers are still finding weapons and ammunition embedded in old trees and in rock crevices. Thousands of spent and live cartridges have made it into private collections. After the battle, 985 miners were indicted for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, and treason against the state of West Virginia. Though some were acquitted by sympathetic juries, others were imprisoned for years. The last was paroled in 1925. At Blizzard's trial, the unexploded bomb was used as evidence of the government and companies' brutality, and he was acquitted.  Legacy  left In the short term the battle was an overwhelming victory for coal industry owners and management. UMW membership plummeted from more than 50,000 miners to approximately 10,000 over the next several years, and it was not until 1935following the Great Depression and the beginning of the New Deal under President Franklin Delano Rooseveltthat the UMW fully organized in southern West Virginia. This union defeat had major implications for the UMWA as a whole. After World War I, as the coal industry began to collapse, union mining was no longer financially sustainable. Because of the defeat in West Virginia, the union was undermined in Pennsylvania and Kentucky also. By the end of 1925 Illinois was the only remaining unionized state that could compete, in terms of soft coal production, with the others listed. In the long term, the battle raised awareness of the appalling conditions miners faced in the dangerous West Virginia coalfields, and led directly to a change in union tactics in political battles to get the law on labor's side via confrontations with recalcitrant and abusive managements and thence to the much larger organized labor victory a few years later during the New Deal in 1933. That in turn led to the UMWA helping organize many better-known unions, such as the Steel Workers during the mid-'30s. In the final analysis, management's success was a Pyrrhic victory that helped lead to a much larger and stronger organized labor movement in many other industries and labor union affiliations and umbrella organizations, such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).  Future of site  A group of miners display one of the bombs dropped by Chafin's airplanes. Starting in the summer of 2006 a local hobby archeologist, Kenneth King, led a team of professional archeologists to further investigate the battlefield. King and the team's initial survey \\"mapped 15 combat sites and discovered more than a thousand artifacts, from rifle and shotgun shell casings to coins and batteries [and] little sign of disturbance\\" to the site, challenging earlier surveys conducted by Arch. In April 2008, Blair Mountain was chosen for the list of protected places on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The site was accepted, and added to the NRHP list on March 30, 2009, although clerical errors by the West Virginia State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) failed to notarize all objections. In mid-2010, \\"Subsidiaries of two of the United States' largest coal producers ‚Äì Arch Coal, Inc., and Massey Energy Company, ... ‚Äì hold permits to blast and strip-mine huge chunks of the upper slopes and ridge of Blair Mountain, removing much of the mountaintop\\", National Geographic reported.Pringle, Heather, \\"Coal Firms to Strip-Mine Historic Battlefield?\\", National Geographic, June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-24. In October 2012 a federal district judge ruled that a coalition of preservation groups did not have standing to sue to protect the historic site. On August 26, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted 2‚Äì1 to overturn the ruling and returned the case. In April 2016 the order to remove the Blair Mountain battlefield from the National Register was overturned by a federal court, and the further decision to add the site back to the register was turned over to the Keeper of the National Register. On June 27, 2018, the Keeper's Office decided that the 2009 decision to remove the site from its listings was \\"erroneous\\" and issued a statement confirming that as of that date the site was again on the National Register.  In fiction  The Blair Mountain march, as well as the events leading up to it and those immediately following it, are depicted in the novels Storming Heaven (Denise Giardina, 1987), Blair Mountain (Jonathan Lynn, 2006), and Carla Rising (Topper Sherwood, 2015). In The Ballad of Trenchmouth Taggart (Glenn Taylor, 2008) the book's main character meets Sid Hatfield, and is involved in the Matewan massacre and the ensuing battle. John Sayles' 1987 film Matewan depicts the Matewan Massacre, a small part of the Blair Mountain story. Diane Gilliam Fisher's poetry collection Kettle Bottom also focuses on the events of the Battle of Blair Mountain, from the perspective of the miners' families.  In music  Political cartoon showing soldier with rifle trained on striking miner; standing to the right, behind the soldier, are President Harding and a mine owner. The caption reads \\"West Virginia: The same old line up.\\" (1921) Tom Breiding's \\"Union Miner\\" from \\"The Unbroken Circle: Songs of the West Virginia Coalfields\\" (2008) accurately depicts events surrounding the Battle of Blair Mountain from the perspective of a coal miner preparing to march. \\"Union Miner\\" can be heard at virtually every event sponsored by the United Mine Workers of America today. Tom Breiding has provided the music for the UMWA's \\"Fairness at Patriot\\" campaign (2013‚Äì14), the UMWA centennial commemoration of the Ludlow Massacre in Colorado (2014), the inauguration of UMWA officers (2014), and various other Mine Workers events. \\"Miners' Rebellion\\" (2012) by alt country band The Miners tells the story of the Battle of Blair Mountain. The song is contained on The Miners debut EP also entitled Miners' Rebellion. When Miners March (2007) contains 16 recently written songs (not music from the 1920s) from the audiobook When Miners March ‚Äì The Battle of Blair Mountain. \\"Battle of Blair Mountain\\" (2004) is a song by folk singer David Rovics and can be found on his album Songs for Mahmud. The song \\"Battle of Blair Mountain\\" (2010) written by Louise Mosrie and Mike Richardson can be found on Louise Mosrie's album Home (Zoe Cat Music/BMI). The song \\"Red Neck War\\" by Byzantine is based on the Battle of Blair Mountain and can be found on the group's 2005 album ... And They Shall Take Up Serpents (Prosthetic Records). The song \\"Black Lung\\" by The Radio Nationals (band) is also based on this conflict. Blair Pathways (2011) is a multimedia project, including a CD and maps, tracing the history of the Blair Mountain area and its labor disputes. It contains music by a number of traditional artists, including Riley Baugus and Tim Eriksen. Chicago Irish folk punk band The Fisticuffs released a song titled \\"The Ballad of Bill Blizzard\\" on their 2011 final album You'll Not Take Us Alive about the battle of Blair Mountain. Kentucky country artist Tyler Childers released \\"Long Violent History\\" in September 2020, and in his recorded commentary on the song he draws a parallel between the battle of Blair Mountain and the Black Lives Matter movement.  Historic interpretation  The Battle of Blair Mountain is interpreted by the state of West Virginia through a Historic Highway marker. The marker was made by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. The marker reads, > BATTLE OF BLAIR MT. In August of 1921, 7000 striking miners led by Bill > Blizzard met at Marmet for a march on Logan to organize the southern > coalfields for the UMWA. Reaching Blair Mt. on August 31, they were repelled > by deputies and mine guards, under Sheriff Don Chafin, waiting in fortified > positions. The five day battle ended with the arrival of U.S. Army and Air > Corps. UMWA organizing efforts in southern WV were halted until 1933. The marker is on West Virginia 17, about east of Logan, between Ethel and Blair.

United States Secret Service, 816 F. Supp. 432 (W.D. Tex. 1993), was a lawsuit arising from a 1990 raid by the United States Secret Service on the headquarters of Steve Jackson Games (SJG) in Austin, Texas. The raid, along with the Secret Service's unrelated Operation Sundevil, was influential in the founding of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Raid In October 1988, Bell South became aware that a proprietary document relating to its 9-1-1 system had been posted on a bulletin board system (BBS) in Illinois. This was reported to the Secret Service in July 1989. In February 1990 Secret Service found that the document had been posted on the \\"Phoenix\\" BBS in Austin, Texas, which was operated by Loyd Blankenship, who was at the time employed by SJG and moderator of the company's own BBS, \\"Illuminati.\\" The Secret Service believed there was probable cause to search computers belonging to Blankenship and his employer, and a search warrant was issued on February 28.816 F. Supp. at 436. The Secret Service executed the warrant on SJG on 1 March 1990.816 F. Supp. at 437. Three SJG computers were seized, along with over 300 floppy disks. Among these was the master copy of GURPS Cyberpunk, a role-playing game written by Blankenship which SJG was about to release.816 F. Supp. at 438‚Äì439. The \\"Illuminati\\" server included private personal emails to and from SJG employees.816 F. Supp. at 441. The material was returned in June 1990.816 F. Supp. at 439. Trial SJG sued the Secret Service for damages arising from loss of revenue while the computers were in its custody. Steve Jackson and three other employees also sued for invasion of privacy, claiming the seizures were illegal under the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, Electronic Communications Privacy Act and Stored Communications Act.816 F.Supp. at 434. Loyd Blankenship was not party to the suits.816 F. Supp. at 432. The case came to trial in 1993 in the Western Texas District Court. SJG was represented by the Austin firm of George, Donaldson & Ford, while the lead counsel was Pete Kennedy. SJG won two out of the three counts and was awarded $50,000 in statutory damages and $250,000 in attorney's fees. No compensatory damages were awarded. The judge said that Steve Jackson had little involvement in SJG at the time of the raid, and the company was close to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and that Jackson's renewed involvement in the wake of the raid had turned the company's fortunes around. The judge reprimanded the Secret Service, calling their warrant preparation \\"sloppy,\\" suggesting that they needed \\"better education\\" regarding relevant statutes,816 F.Supp. at 444. and finding that they had no basis to suspect SJG of any wrongdoing. The third count dealing with interception of e-mail was upheld in October 1994 by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Electronic Frontier Foundation was an amicus curiae at the appeal. Although the raid was not a part of Operation Sundevil, this law enforcement effort, which spanned two years, has a tarnished image owing to a lack of successful prosecutions and questionable procedures.

Gameplay Two well-known chefs (usually representing their restaurants) along with two members of the studio audience (one per chef) competed as teams to prepare the best meal. One was called \\"Red Tomatoes\\", the other \\"Green Peppers\\". The contestants were then each given $10.00 to spend on whatever they wanted for the chefs to prepare for a meal. The teams were given 20 minutes (later reduced to 18 minutes) to make a meal using the ingredients they had and the usual items found in a kitchen pantry. The host would meanwhile move back and forth between the teams to ask questions about the meals being produced. When time ran out, each team explained the dish they had prepared, after which the audience would vote by holding cards (one per audience member, a tomato on one side and a green pepper on the other) to show which team's meal they liked best. The team with the higher number of votes won the game, with both contestants winning kitchen appliances and/or cookware.

Career Since the Cuban Revolution, Basulto participated in various activities intended to subvert or overthrow the Cuban government. After the revolution, he was trained by the CIA in intelligence, communications, explosives, sabotage and subversion in Panama, Guatemala, and the United States. He was later placed back into Cuba, posing as a physics student at the University of Santiago to help prepare the ground for the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In 1961, under CIA sponsorship, Basulto infiltrated Cuba for a commando operation intended to sabotage an alleged missile site, a mission which was ultimately aborted. In August 1962 he was involved in an expedition of the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil which took a boat to Cuba and fired a 20 mm cannon at a hotel, though nobody was killed in the incident. In the 1980s Basulto flew medical supplies to the Nicaraguan Contras. After the Cuban government shot down the Brothers to the Rescue planes, Basulto sought to have criminal and civil charges pressed over the matter. He was awarded a $1.7 million judgement in January 2005. On May 24 of that same year, Basulto announced a one million dollar reward for information leading to the indictment of Ra√∫l Castro on drug charges or charges related to the shooting of the Hermanos planes. \\"\\"It would throw a wrench in the machinery\\", Basulto said of a possible indictment.

The book, music, and lyrics are by Rick Besoyan. The original Off- Broadway production premiered November 18, 1959 at the Orpheum Theatre in New York City's East Village. Staying in the neighborhood, it moved to the Player's Theatre on June 21, 1961, then, finally, to the Cherry Lane Theatre on March 21, 1962. Closing was Sept. 2, 1962. Combined run was 1,143 performances. It was seen briefly in a West End production in 1962 and has become a popular show for amateur and semi-professional groups in the United States and elsewhere. Background Little Mary Sunshine was conceived and staged as an affectionate sendup of operettas and old-fashioned musicals, the genre of Victor Herbert, Rudolf Friml, and Sigmund Romberg. It also has allusions to Gilbert and Sullivan, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, No√´l Coward, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and other musical theatre composers and lyricists. Its \\"Indians\\" and \\"forest rangers\\" (thinly disguised Mounties) allude to Friml's Rose-Marie, as does the song \\"Colorado Love Call\\". Numerous other, less obvious details point, in a humorous and lighthearted manner, to other operettas and musicals ‚Äî sometimes specifically, sometimes in terms of general categories of songs or characters. The 1954 Marc Blitzstein adaptation of The Threepenny Opera, which ran for six years, showed that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of Jerome Kern and P. G. Wodehouse's Leave It to Jane ran for more than two years. The 1959‚Äì1960 Off-Broadway season included a dozen musicals and revues including Little Mary Sunshine, The Fantasticks, which ran for over 40 years, and Ernest in Love, a musicalization of Oscar Wilde's 1895 hit The Importance of Being Earnest.Suskin, Steven. \\"On the Record: Ernest In Love, Marco Polo, Puppets and Maury Yeston\\" , Playbill.com, August 10, 2003. Productions The original Off-Broadway production opened on November 18, 1959, at the Orpheum Theatre in New York City's East Village and was directed and choreographed by Ray Harrison and featured Eileen Brennan in the title role, with William Graham as Captain Warington, and John McMartin as Corporal Jester. It closed in September 1962 after a run of 1,143 performances. Two pianos supplied the musical accompaniment. The musical acquired orchestral accompaniment when Capitol Records chose to feature it as that firm's first original cast recording of an off-Broadway show. London's original West End production of the show ‚Äî in some respects the first full stage presentation ‚Äî was directed by Paddy Stone and starred Patricia Routledge, Terence Cooper, Bernard Cribbins and Ed Bishop. It opened on May 17, 1962 at the Comedy Theatre but was compared unfavourably with The Boy Friend and closed after only 42 performances.Green, Stanley. Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre (1980), Da Capo Press, , p. 255 Critics of this musical have objected that it stereotypes and demeans Native Americans. However, the show also lampoons Caucasians, men, Mounties, opera stars, generals, the young, and the elderly. Characters * Captain \\"Big Jim\\" Warington, handsome Captain of the Forest Rangers: baritone - Primarily, Jim represents Rose-Marie's Jim Kenyon, although he gets his Ranger (Mountie) uniform from Sergeant Malone. (In fact, in spite of his rank, in some productions he wears sergeant's stripes). Generically, Jim also represents other operetta leaders of men (and singers of rallying songs) such as Fran√ßois Villon, leader of the Paris rabble in The Vagabond King (\\"Song of the Vagabonds\\"); Robert Misson, leader of the New Orleans antiroyalty men in The New Moon (\\"Stout-hearted Men); and the Red Shadow, leader of the Riffs in The Desert Song (\\"The Riff Song\\"). * \\"Little Mary Sunshine\\" (Mary Potts), proprietress of the Colorado Inn: soprano (called \\"Little Merry Sunshine\\" by the Kadotas) - Mary is primarily a caricature of Rose-Marie's Rose-Marie La Flamme, but also generically represents operetta heroines, the sweethearts of the leaders of men. In the London production, Patricia Routledge, who had an ample figure, brought out aspects of Mary's role linking her with \\"Little Buttercup\\" from HMS Pinafore. In practice, to emphasize the humor, Mary is usually played by a character actress rather than a conventional \\"leading lady\\". * Madame Ernestine von Liebedich, an elderly opera singer: contralto - Ernestine resembles Sarah Millick, heroine of Coward's Bitter Sweet, and like her prototype has \\"sweet memories\\" of Vienna that \\"across the years . . . come to\\" her‚Äîwords from the song \\"I'll See You Again\\". The name Liebedich recalls Edvard Grieg's composition \\"Ich Liebe Dich\\" (\\"I Love You\\"). Her name also resembles that of opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink, on whom she may be partially based. * Corporal \\"Billy\\" Jester, a Forest Ranger: tenor or high baritone - Billy and his girlfriend Nancy, the show's comedic bickering lovers, closely resemble Ado Annie and Will Parker from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!. * Nancy Twinkle, the show's soubrette - Like Ado Annie, Nancy loves her man, yet is perhaps even fonder of men in general. * Chief Brown Bear, chief of the Kadota (anagram of Dakota) Indians - Brown Bear is based on Chief Sitting Bull, from Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun. Both characters are admirable - wise, restrained, and generous - and both are father figures to their respective heroines. *Yellow Feather, Brown Bear's rogue son - The show's villain lampoons Rose-Marie 's villainous Black Eagle. Both have two-part names whose first word is a color and whose second word relates to birds. Yellow Feather's conversion to a flag waving patriot in the finale parallels the reform of the pirates in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance. * Fleet Foot, an Indian guide - Fleet Foot is elderly and no longer able to live up to his name. * General Oscar Fairfax, Ret., an elderly Washington diplomat who likes to flirt with younger ladies - Oscar's bringing gifts for the young ladies and asking to be called \\"Uncle\\" recalls Uncle (or \\"Godfather\\") Drosselmeyer from Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker - although of course the aging roue is also a stock character in operetta and old-fashioned musical comedy. *Young Ladies from the Eastchester Finishing School: Cora, Henrietta, Gwendolyn, Blanche, Maud, and Mabel (who has no lines). (Millicent added in the vocal score) *Forest Rangers: Pete, Slim, Tex, Buster, Hank, and Tom (Chuck added in the vocal score) Synopsis Time: Early in \\"this\\" century i.e., the 20th century Place: The Colorado Inn (shades of the White Horse Inn), high in the Rocky Mountains (standing in for the Tyrol) ;Act I Little Mary Sunshine, foster daughter of Chief Brown Bear of the Kadota tribe, is in trouble. The government is threatening to foreclose the mortgage on her Colorado Inn, located on land that is subject to a dispute between Brown Bear and Uncle Sam. On Mary's advice Brown Bear is engaged in peaceful legal proceedings rather than warfare to establish his rights. Captain Jim and his Forest Rangers arrive. They are searching for the disruptive Indian Yellow Feather. Yellow Feather's \\"crimes\\" are actually not murder and pillage but indiscriminate hunting and irresponsible use of fire in the forest, but he is nonetheless a villain of the deepest dye, who has threatened to \\"have his way\\" with Mary. Jim woos Mary, after which the two get well-sung advice from Mary's opera star guest Mme. Ernestine Liebedich. Some young ladies from the Eastchester Finishing School (implicitly in New York or Pennsylvania, which have Westchesters) are also Inn guests. While they entertain themselves playing croquet and swinging on swings, the Rangers come upon them. The Rangers' flirting elicits an immediate enthusiastic response, and love blooms once more as they joyfully sing together. Later, the young ranger Billy and his girlfriend Nancy squabble about Nancy's appetite for other men. Jim and Mary return to the spotlight. Mary reveals her \\"Little Buttercup\\" secret: Yellow Feather is really Brown Bear's son, long believed dead. As the first act ends, Jim and his aged Indian guide Fleet Foot set off to capture Yellow Feather. ;Act II Mary holds a garden party featuring the Eastchester ladies and the Rangers. Retired General Oscar Fairfax shows up, bringing a box of gifts for the ladies. Taking command of the Rangers in Jim's absence, he directs the Rangers to depart, find Jim, and bring him back. Fairfax now has the ladies to himself. But his interest shifts to Mme. Ernestine when he meets her and learns they have something in common: in their youth, both spent happy days in Vienna. Mary goes to her garden. Yellow Feather sneaks in, finds her there, ties her to a tree, and threatens to debase her. Jim returns just in time and wrests a knife from the villain. The Rangers, who have surrounded the Inn, capture Yellow Feather as he tries to escape. The rest of the cast then emerges. Fairfax has good news: the courts have upheld Brown Bear's claim to the disputed land, a mere one-fourth of Colorado. The chief gives Mary the Inn's land and dedicates the rest for a national park, a place the Rangers can call home. In the finale, a miraculously reformed Yellow Feather reappears, waving a large American flag. Jim and Mary, Billy and Nancy, Oscar and Ernestine, and several Ranger-Eastchester couples seem headed for the altar. Music The musical numbers for Little Mary Sunshine are appropriately tongue-in-cheek: any triteness and corn (and there is a good deal of both) is fully intended, rather than inadvertent. This is musical parody at a very high level. Particularly memorable among the songs are the show's most conspicuously parodic song, \\"Colorado Love Call\\" (\\"Indian Love Call\\" revisited), which evokes memories of Nelson Eddy's duets with Jeanette MacDonald; the hopelessly optimistic \\"Look for a Sky of Blue\\"; the catchy yet schmaltzy tune \\"In Izzenschnooken on the Lovely Essenzook Zee\\"; the soft-shoe- styled \\"Once in a Blue Moon\\"; the lyrical waltzes \\"You're the Fairest Flower\\" and \\"Do You Ever Dream of Vienna?\\"; the comedy-lyric-laden \\"Mata Hari\\"; and especially the exaggerated triple-counterpoint medley \\"Playing Croquet\\", \\"Swinging\\", and \\"How Do You Do?\\" (three songs combined instead of the usual two). Here is a list of the numbers: ;Overture ;Act I *The Forest Rangers *Little Mary Sunshine *Look for a Sky of Blue *You're the Fairest Flower *In Izzenschnooken on the Lovely Essenzook Zee *Playing Croquet *Swinging *How Do You Do? *Tell a Handsome Stranger *Once in a Blue Moon *Colorado Love Call *Every Little Nothing *Finale (\\"What Has Happened?\\"; \\"Look for a Sky of Blue\\") ;Act II *Such a Merry Party *Say \\"Uncle\\" *Me a Heap Big Injun *Naughty, Naughty Nancy *Mata Hari *Do You Ever Dream of Vienna? *A Shell Game (pantomime) *Coo Coo *Finale (\\"The Forest Rangers\\"; \\"Look for a Sky of Blue\\") Song annotations The songs in Little Mary Sunshine allude to earlier shows, their songs, and their characters.Knapp, Raymond. The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 40‚Äì50 *The Forest Rangers is a parody of \\"Tramp, tramp, tramp\\", from Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta, although it also alludes less directly to the whole genre of \\"gallant warriors\\" songs, notably \\"The Mounties\\", from Friml's Rose-Marie; \\"Stout Hearted Men\\", from Romberg's The New Moon; \\"The Riff Song\\", from Romberg's The Desert Song; \\"Song of the Vagabonds\\", from Friml's The Vagabond King; and arguably even \\"March of the Toys\\", from Herbert's Babes in Toyland. The line \\"For there's always one more hill beyond the hill beyond the hill ... [six \\"hill\\" mentions]\\" apes the title of \\"There's a Hill Beyond a Hill\\", from Kern and Hammerstein's Music in the Air (Mandelbaum, CD 10). \\"The Forest Rangers\\" also echoes the Boy Scout Law (\\"A scout is trustworthy...\\") by giving the rangers nine of the twelve Scout Law attributes: \\"He's thoughtful and he's courteous and kind. He's reverent and brave. ... He's clean in soul and body and mind. He's cheerful, honest [\\"trustworthy\\"], thrifty and obedient.\\" *Little Mary Sunshine mimics the title song from Rose-Marie. Both songs are title songs, and both use the name of the play's heroine as the song title. *Look for A Sky of Blue alludes to \\"Look for the Silver Lining\\", from Jerome Kern's Sally. \\"When e‚Äôer a cloud appears,\\" is the first five words of both the first line of the chorus of \\"Sky of Blue\\" and the second line of the chorus of \\"Silver Lining\\". *You're the Fairest Flower [\\"...An American Beauty Rose\\"] alludes particularly to two operetta songs with \\"Rose\\" in their titles ‚Äì the title song from Friml's Rose-Marie and \\"Only a Rose\\", from Friml's The Vagabond King ‚Äì but also alludes generally to other boy-serenades-girl love songs, such as the title song from Romberg's The Desert Song; \\"Serenade\\", from Romberg's The Student Prince; and \\"Yours Is My Heart Alone\\", from Franz Leh√°r's The Land of Smiles. *In Izzenschnooken on the Lovely Essenzook Zee pays tribute to \\"In Egern on the Tegern See\\", another tune from Kern and Hammerstein's Music in the Air (Mandelbaum, CD 10, also notes that it alludes generally to nostalgia songs like \\"Golden Days\\", from Romberg's The Student Prince; \\"Will You Remember\\", from Romberg's Maytime; \\"I‚Äôll See You Again\\", from No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet; and \\"When I Grow too Old to Dream\\", from Romberg's The Night is Young. *Playing Croquet + Swinging + How Do You Do? alludes to counterpoint songs in Irving Berlin and Meredith Willson musicals. Sung first separately, then with the first two combined, and finally with all three sung simultaneously in fine harmony, Besoyan's songs display counterpoint one-upsmanship. Counterpoint, in the context of popular music, is the simultaneous singing of separate songs, each with its own lyrics and each designed to harmonize with the other(s). Berlin's \\"Play a Simple Melody\\", from Watch Your Step, and \\"You‚Äôre Just in Love\\", from Call Me Madam, both have an initial tune and an untitled counterpoint tune that are sung simultaneously after first being sung independently; so does Willson's \\"Lida Rose\\" + \\"Will I Ever Tell You?\\", from The Music Man. Rick Besoyan salutes Berlin and Willson by doing them one better: combining three songs. *Tell a Handsome Stranger alludes generally to boy-meets-girl songs such as \\"Kiss Me Again\\", from Herbert's Mlle. Modiste; \\"I‚Äôm Falling in Love with Someone\\", from Herbert's Naughty Marietta; \\"Marianne\\", from Romberg's The New Moon; and \\"Make Believe\\", from Kern's Show Boat; but the number particularly alludes to \\"Tell Me Pretty Maiden\\", from Leslie Stuart's Florodora (Mandelbaum, CD 10), the 1899 British musical comedy that moved to Broadway in 1900. A prominent feature of both numbers is the \\"walkaround\\" ritornello; a similar passage in the same \\"strolling\\" tempo occurs in \\"Half-past Two\\", a number from the popular Edwardian musical comedy \\"The Arcadians\\" (1909). The line \\"I'm falling ‚Äì I‚Äôm falling in love with you\\" once more suggests Herbert's \\"I‚Äôm Falling in Love with Someone.\\" The words \\"Oh, joy!\\" reflect the song \\"Oh Joy, Oh Rapture Unforeseen\\", from Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore. And the words \\"You make my little heart go pitty-pat\\" closely paraphrase the words \\"Your heart goes pitter-patter\\", found in the counterpoint verse of Berlin's \\"You‚Äôre Just in Love\\", from Call Me Madam. *Once in a Blue Moon alludes to the Romberg operetta The New Moon and to its song \\"Lover Come Back To Me.\\" The antecedent tune's opening lines are \\"The sky was blue, and high above, the moon was new, and so was love.\\" \\"Blue Moon\\" not only rhymes with \\"New Moon\\", it incorporates the word \\"blue\\" from the lyrics of \\"Lover Come Back to Me.\\" And both songs display the theme of interrupted love. Viewed from the comedy perspective, \\"Once in a Blue Moon\\" evokes the lyrics of \\"All Er Nuthin\\", from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!. Both lyrics have two lovers ‚Äì secondary characters ‚Äì arguing about the girl's flirtatious ways. *Colorado Love Call alludes to \\"Indian Love Call\\", from Rose-Marie. *Every Little Nothing alludes to \\"Every Little Movement\\", from Karl Hoschna's Madame Sherry. The first five notes (sung with \\"ev-ry lit-l moe/nuth) of both songs are identical. The later words \\"every little moment\\" reinforce the parallelism by substituting \\"moment\\" for \\"movement\\" ‚Äì a play on words. *Such a Merry Party alludes to \\"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\\", from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel; and perhaps also to \\"Drinking Song\\", from Romberg's The Student Prince. *Say \\"Uncle\\" is primarily a parody of \\"Call Me Uncle\\" from Friml's operetta The Firefly, although it also close parallels with \\"Every Day is Ladies' Day with Me' from Victor Herbert's \\"The Red Mill\\": the rhythms are the same and all three are confessions of an old roue who can't help spending money on pretty young girls, or \\"the dimpled darlings\\". There are also echoes of \\"Uncle\\" Drosselmeyer from The Nutcracker, a ballet. *Me a Heap Big Injun alludes to \\"I'm An Indian, Too\\" from Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun. Billy appears in \\"Indian\\" costume to sing how he always wanted to grow up to be an Indian Brave. Close parallels are evident: both songs lampoon \\"stage Indians\\" played (without much conviction) by white people, including perhaps the \\"Indian\\" characters in this very show. Both songs satirise racial stereotyping of Native Americans, although (especially in the case of \\"Heap Big Injun\\") this is done rather crudely and occasionally causes offence. *Naughty, Naughty Nancy has a title that alludes to the title of Victor Herbert's operetta Naughty Marietta. The content and tone is similar to many operetta soubrette's numbers. *Mata Hari is related to \\"Cleopatterer\\", a Jerome Kern song from \\"Leave It to Jane\\" ( 1917). Nancy describes Mata \\"doing this-a and that-a\\"; in \\"Jane\\", Flora sings \\" It simply use to knock them flat, When she went like this and then like that\\". Other \\"man-hungry soubrette\\" songs that Besoyan probably had in mind include \\"I Cain't Say No\\", from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!, and \\"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\\", from Kern's Show Boat. *Do You Ever Dream of Vienna? is another nostalgia song like \\"Izzenschnooken.\\" Besoyan's song pays homage to \\"Vienna Mine\\", from Emmerich Kalman's operetta Countess Maritza - although a number in praise of Vienna is not uncommon in operetta generally! It also seems to hint at \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\\" from Burton Lane's Finian's Rainbow. *A Shell Game (pantomime) alludes to the Victor Herbert operetta Babes in Toyland, which includes pantomime, but is similar generally to the full range of Broadway pantomime, the best example of which is the dream ballet sequence from Oklahoma!, danced to the song \\"Out of My Dreams.\\" *Coo Coo refers to another \\"bird-call\\" song, \\"Whip-Poor-Will\\" by Jerome Kern ( lyrics by B.G. DeSylva). It first appeared in the unsuccessful \\"Zip Goes a Million\\" ( 1919), but was resurrected in 1920 when sung by Marilyn Miller in \\"Sally\\". The second and third notes of the bird-call ( \\"poor-will\\") are identical to the cuckoo call. There may also be an allusion to \\"Bluebird of Happiness\\", a 1934 non-Broadway song popularized by Metropolitan Opera tenor Jan Peerce. Both title birds, according to their songs‚Äô lyrics, bring cheer to sad listeners. Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (1985) featured a desperate suitor singing of a bird that died of heartbreak, singing \\"Willow, titwillow\\" late in the opera.

But there are also echos of Strauss, Herbert, Kern, Romberg, Youmans, Friml, and anybody else who brought romantic lovers together in a triumphant last scene... it is seldom that a subtle satiric idea is brought off so adroitly in both the writing and the performing.\\"Atkinson, Brooks. \\"Said With Music\\", The New York Times, November 29, 1959, p. X1 On the London production, The New York Times London correspondent wrote: \\"Even Little Mary Sunshine which arrived from Off- Broadway with a big reputation, seemed to us forced and its humors underscored, especially in comparison with The Boyfriend.

A fractional rig on a sailing vessel consists of a foresail, such as a jib or genoa sail, that does not reach all the way to the top of the mast. In the adjacent picture, the forestay that secures the mast at the front of the boat is attached to the mast at a lower point and the fore sail (jib or genoa) is rigged to this stay. The mast is farther forward on the boat than on a masthead rig and so it has a larger main sail. Masthead rigs are most common on larger keel boats or cruisers. A fractional rig is typically used on sailing dinghies and racing oriented keel boats, such as the J/24. Fractional rigs were introduced on race boats in order to allow more controllability of the surface of the main sail and also less drag when sailing upwind. According to one manufacturer, \\"a key to making fast boats easier to sail than slow boats is the 'fractional rig'\\". Fractional rigs tend to have a larger main sail and a smaller headsail which is often a non-overlapping jib. This configuration is optimized for up-wind sailing efficiency. For downwind sailing without a spinnaker, the larger mainsail of a fractional rig has a significant advantage over a masthead rig, but a disadvantage when spinnakers are flown. Many newer high-performance fractional rig sailboats, fly the spinnaker or the gennaker from the masthead. On many modern skiffs and race dinghies, the jib is relatively small compared to the size of the main and it is normally left in place when the spinnaker or gennaker is used due to this type of jib's minimal aerodynamic interference. Another major advantage of the fractional rig, especially the '3/4' rig (where the fore stay goes 3/4 the way up the mast), is that the jib can be taken in without inducing excessive weather helm which could cause the boat to lose control and ‚Äúround up‚Äù into the wind. With the masthead sloop, both the main and the jib must be reduced in size evenly when shortening sail. This is typically accomplished by reefing the main and either rolling up a portion of the headsail on a furler, or changing to a smaller headsail. Since jibs need considerable forestay tension to set properly and the amount of tension needed increases with wind speed, being able to drop the jib altogether in windy conditions puts less strain on the rig and hull. Fractional rigs are used on lightly built multi-hulls for this reason.  History  Throughout the 20th century, most sloops of less than 20 feet in length have had fractional rigs. Many (perhaps most) sailing sloops from the first part of the 20th century were fractional rigged. The increased prevalence of fractional rigs on sloops in the early 20th century probably coincided roughly with the disappearance of the gaff rig. One possibility for its increased prevalence during this era is that, relative to a masthead rig, it allows the designer to provide the boat with more sail area without using a bowsprit or a boom that extends beyond the stern, and without demanding that the sails be of a very high aspect ratio. This was important because the sailcloth available in those days made it difficult to construct high-aspect sails. As sailcloth improved in the second half of the 20th century, it became possible to construct sails of a higher aspect ratio. It therefore became more practical for sloops to be designed with the simpler masthead-rigged mast. Most production sailboats from the '60s and '70s were masthead-rigged sloops. Masthead-rigged sloops typically carry a larger spinnaker than fractional-rigged sloops, and therefore enjoy a speed advantage when racing downwind. Fractional rigged sloops are starting to become popular again, especially for high-performance racing boats. A fractional rig allows the mast to bend more easily, which in turn allows more adjustment to the shape of the mainsail, especially when sailing upwind. Many people believe that a fractional-rigged sloop is faster upwind than a similar masthead-rigged sloop, especially as the wind strength increases. Most of the newest generation of fractional-rigged sloops fly their spinnakers from the top of the mast. These boats are said to have \\"masthead spinnakers\\", and this development gives the boat very good performance both upwind and downwind in all wind strengths.  Maintaining forestay tension  An inherent problem of a fractional rig is its inability to exert as much tension on the forestay as a similar masthead rig. The reason for this is because the attachment point of the forestay is not directly opposite to the backstay. Under certain conditions, the moment arm that results from these offset attachment points can be used to advantage, as this is an effective method of inducing bend in the mast, which in turn flattens the mainsail. If the distance between the attachment points is too great, a mast of average stiffness will be unable to apply optimum forestay tension, unless one of the following mast-stiffening design features is used: * Jumper Stays‚ÄîThese additional stays and their associated jumper struts limit the amount that the upper portion of the mast can bend, and thereby enable tension to be effectively transferred from the backstay to the forestay. Jumper stays were common in the first part of the 20th century. Their biggest disadvantage is weight and windage aloft. * Running Backstays‚ÄîThese are supplemental temporary backstays (one on each side) that attach opposite of the forestay. They are very effective at generating forestay tension, but make the boat more difficult to tack because one running backstay needs to be released and the other one applied each time the boat tacks. * Swept back spreaders‚ÄîSwept back spreaders (or rather their associated shrouds, which attach to the deck significantly aft of the mast) provide significant fore-and-aft support to the mast, and thereby increase tension in the forestay. The biggest disadvantage of this scheme is that it makes it difficult to deliberately slacken the forestay for the purpose of making the jib fuller in light winds.

In 1978, China and Japan normalized their diplomatic relations. Deng Xiaoping had visited to Japan to sign a treaty and to look at its development. As a result, China decided to borrow 220 million dollars in soft loans from Japan when the amount of foreign currency preparation was 167 million dollars. China poured that money into social infrastructures. In 2001 it received US$1.4 billion in foreign aid, or about US$1.10 per capita. This total was down from the 1999 figure of US$2.4 billion, or US$1.90 per capita. In 2003 China received US$1.3 billion in aid, or about US$1 per capita. Like other countries in recent years, the United States has rapidly lowered foreign aid to China, reaching about $12 million from USAID for 2011. The aid goes to Tibetan communities, rule of law initiatives, and climate change policy. In 2011, an aid package amounting to $3.95 million and designated for climate change was the subject of a critical Congressional panel hearing titled \\"Feeding the Dragon: Reevaluating U.S. Development Assistance to China\\". Some of this aid comes to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the form of socioeconomic development assistance through the United Nations (UN) system. The PRC received US$112 million in such UN assistance annually in 2001 and 2002, the largest portion coming from the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

The confection was known only as Chocodiles prior to 2014. The package describes the snack cake as a \\"chocolate coated sponge cake with creamy filling.\\" The Chocodile is Twinkie-shaped and sold in packages of two. History The Chocodiles mascot was formerly Chauncey Chocodile, but Hostess has removed him from packaging and their website in recent years. Since the late 1990s, Chocodiles have no longer been sold on the East Coast of the United States. Hostess had only a few West Coast factories making them, and to ensure the products' freshness, Chocodiles were sold only on the West Coast. There has been debate over whether a Chocodile is a chocolate-covered Twinkie. The debate arose from the seeming \\"texture difference\\" between the Twinkie and the Chocodile. During a taste test and debate in Vacaville, California, opinions were split among those taking the test as to whether the taste of the cake was the same. This issue was resolved during a show on the Food Network where it was confirmed by Hostess that the Chocodile was, in fact, a chocolate-covered Twinkie. This has caused consternation for some, who continue to swear the cake is different. In actuality, it is the chocolate that makes the difference. Due to the chocolate coating, the cake tends to stay more moist, leading to the slightly different texture when compared to a normal Twinkie. In 2014, Hostess Brands re-introduced the cake as \\"Chocodile Twinkies\\".https://huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/chocodile- twinkies_n_5568221.html The new cakes are 1.45 oz. each, and are labelled as \\"Fun Size\\", as the original Chocodiles were 2 oz. each. They are also now available on the East Coast. In 2017, Hostess re-introduced the full sized Chocodiles as \\"Fudge Covered Twinkies\\". In popular culture In the 1987 comedy film Summer School, teacher Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) bonds with a fellow teacher (Kirstie Alley) with a junk food binge; at one point, Allen declines another snack cake, stating she'll stick with the Chocodiles. In the TV series American Dad!, it is Roger the alien's favorite snack food.

Beit ed-Dine (), also known as Btaddine () is a small town and the administrative capital of the Chouf District in the Mount Lebanon Governorate in Lebanon. The town is located 45 kilometers southeast of Beirut, and near the town of Deir el-Qamar from which it is separated by a steep valley. It had 1,613 registered voters in 2010 and its inhabitants are predominantly Christians from the Maronite, Melkite and Greek Orthodox denominations. Beit ed-Dine's total land area consists of 244 hectares and its average elevation is 860 meters above sea level. The town is well known for the Beiteddine Palace, which hosts the annual summer Beiteddine Festival. History =Ottoman era= Emir Bashir II of the Shihab dynasty, who later became the ruler of the Mount Lebanon Emirate, started building the palace in 1788 at the site of the Druze hermitage (hence the town's name, translating as \\"House of Faith\\"), indicating that the town was initially populated by Druze before Bashir lived in it. Bashir moved the headquarters of the emirate from Deir al-Qamar to Beit ed-Dine by 1811. He ruled from the palace he built, known as the Beiteddine Palace, which he supplied with water by building a lengthy canal connecting the palace to the Safa River. After 1840, when Emir Bashir II was sent into exile the palace was used by the Ottomans as a government building. During the French Mandate its role was preserved and it served as a local administrative office. In 1934, it was declared a national monument. During the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, around 200 Christians from Deir al-Qamar fled to the Ottoman barracks at Beit ed-Dine to seek shelter before their town was attacked by Druze fighters.Fawaz 1994, p. 72. After Deir al-Qamar was plundered by the Druze and its inhabitants massacred, they proceeded to attack the Christians who were sheltering at Beit ed-Dine. The outnumbered Ottoman garrison did not resist and the barracks was assaulted.Fawaz 1994, p. 74. During the French-led international intervention in the war, the French colonel, d'Arricau, chose Bashir's palace in Beiteddine as his headquarters.Fawaz 1994, p. 124. In the 1860s, the headquarters of the Ottoman deputy governor in Mount Lebanon was relocated to the Beiteddine Palace.Fawaz 1994, p. 178. During official celebrations in Beit ed-Dine marking the enthronement of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, Druze and Maronites from the vicinity clashed in the town, resulting in the deaths of one person from each sect. A week later, a delegation of the local, reformist Liberal Party issued a set of demands in Beit ed-Dine calling for reforms such as the abolition of new taxes and the dismissal of corrupt officials. The governor of Beirut Vilayet, Yusuf Pasha, rejected the demands and ordered the demonstrator's dispersal. However, the Ottoman garrison in Beit ed-Dine sympathized with the demonstrators and refused to disperse them. The governor ultimately acceded to the demonstrators' demands. =Modern Era= Beiteddine is the capital of the Chouf District In 1943, Bechara El Khoury, the first Lebanese President, declared it the official president's summer residence. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990) it was heavily damaged. After 1984, when fighting in the area receded, Walid Jumblatt ordered its restoration. Parts of the palace are today open to the public while the rest is still the president's summer residence. Bashir built three more palaces in the town for his sons, till today only Mir Amin Palace survived and is today a luxury hotel.

It started as education of converts to Christianity, but as the religion became institutionalized, catechesis was used for education of members who had been baptized as infants. As defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 5 (quoting Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Exhortation Catechesi tradendae, ¬ß18): > Catechesis is an education in the faith of children, young people and adults > which includes especially the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted, > generally speaking, in an organic and systematic way, with a view to > initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life. In the Catholic Church, catechist is a term used of anyone engaged in religious formation and education, from the bishop to lay ecclesial ministers and clergy to volunteers at the local level. The primary catechists for children are their parents or communities. Protestant churches typically have Sunday School classes for educating children in religion, as well as adult classes for continuing education. In ecclesiology, a catechumen (; via Latin catechumenus from Greek Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑œáŒøœçŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ katƒìkhoumenos, \\"one being instructed\\", from Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ kata, \\"down\\" and ·º¶œáŒøœÇ ƒìkhos, \\"sound\\") is a person receiving instruction from a catechist in the principles of the Christian religion with a view to baptism. The title and practice is most often used by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox, Reformed/Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic Christians. Ecumenical organisations such as the North American Association for the Catechumenate are helping across several denominations to \\"shape ministries with adult seekers involving an extended time of faith formation and a meaningful experience of adult baptism at Easter.\\" Historic Christian practice The word catechumen comes from the passive form of the Greek word Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑œáŒ≠œâ (katƒìche≈ç), which is used seven times in the New Testament. In the passive, it means \\"to be instructed, informed.\\" The catechumenate slowly developed from the development of doctrine and the need to test converts against the dangers of falling away. The Bible records (Acts 19) that the Apostle Paul while visiting some people who were described as \\"disciples\\", established they had received the baptism of John for the repentance of sins but had not yet heard of or received the Holy Spirit. Further, from the second century it appears that baptisms were held only at certain times of year, indicating that periods of instruction were the rule rather than the exception. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes: \\"As the acceptance of Christianity involved belief in a body of doctrine and the observance of the Divine law (\\"teach, make disciples, scholars of them\\"; \\"teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you\\", Matthew 28:20 [see Great Commission]), it is clear that some sort of preliminary instruction must have been given to the converts.\\" See also Council of Jerusalem. Justin Martyr, in his First Apology, cites instruction as occurring prior to baptism: :As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated. The \\"persuasion\\" would be carried out by the preaching of an evangelist; but since belief must precede baptism, the person concerned should be prepared spiritually to receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit through baptism. That person would receive the sign of the Cross and possibly aspersion with holy water from a minister, indicating their entry to the state of catechumen. In the early church, catechumens were instructed (catechized) in the basic elements of the faith such as the Apostles' Creed, Lord's Prayer, and sacraments in preparation for baptism. Catechumens were limited as to their attendance in formal services. As unbaptized, they could not actively take part in any service, for that was reserved for those baptized. One practice permitted them to remain in the first part of the mass, but even in the earliest centuries dismissed them before the Eucharist. Others had them entering through a side door, or observing from the side, from a gallery, or near the font; while it was not unknown to bar them from all services until baptized. Their desire for baptism was held to be sufficient guarantee of their salvation, if they died before the reception. In event of their martyrdom prior to baptism by water, this was held to be a \\"baptism by blood\\" (Baptism of desire), and they were honored as martyrs. In the fourth century, a widespread practice arose of enrolling as a catechumen and deferring baptism for years, often until shortly before death, and when so ill that the normal practice of immersion was impossible, so that aspersion or affusion‚Äîthe baptism of the sick‚Äîwas necessary. Constantine was the most prominent of these catechumens. See also Deathbed conversion. During the fourth and fifth centuries, baptism had become a several-week-long rite leading up to the baptism on Easter. During this time, catechumens attended several meetings of intensive catechetical preaching, often by the bishop himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, exorcisms, and other rites. Catechumens recited the Apostles' Creed on Holy Saturday to show that one had completed catechetical instruction. By the sixth century, most of those presented for baptism were infants, and pre-baptismal catechesis was abandoned. The decline of preaching and education in general following the barbarian invasions also affected the decline of catechesis. Later, instructors (catechists) would teach Christians who had been baptized as children, to prepare for practicing the religion as thinking persons, both older children and adults. The term, catechism, used for a manual for this instruction, appeared in the Late Middle Ages. During this time the instruction was also expanded to include memorization of the Lord's Prayer and Apostles' Creed. Some clergy probably provided expositions of this material in addition to the Ten Commandments. The main function of catechesis during this period was preparation for confession by enabling the Christian to identify their sins. Cyril of Jerusalem wrote a series of sermons aimed at catechumens, outlining via passages of scripture the main points of the faith, yet dividing between those merely interested and those intending baptism then continuing with certain sermons aimed at those who had been baptized. St. Augustine was among those enrolled as a catechumen as an infant, and did not receive baptism until he was in his thirties. He, and other Fathers, fulminated against the practice. Reformation Presbyterian Catechising, painting by John Phillip Jean Gerson's L'ABC des simples gens was an important catechetical work published at the advent of the printing press. Along with Gerson's other catechetical works, it addressed the unique problems of teaching the faith to children. Sixteenth-century Christian humanists considered the reform of catechesis to be a high priority.Bishop of Basel Christoph von Utenheim, in one of the most successful efforts to revive catechesis, worked to have regular catechetical preaching instituted throughout his diocese. Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg was another popular preacher who followed the tradition of Gerson by preaching on the basics of the faith. During the Protestant Reformation, the Reformers insisted that the Lord's Prayer and other forms be memorized in the vernacular languages of the people, rather than in Latin as was the practice among Roman Catholics. They wanted individuals to be able to fully understand the prayers. (Similarly, worship services were conducted in vernacular languages and Bibles and prayer books printed in vernacular editions.) The use of a question and answer format was popularized by reformer Martin Luther in his 1529 Small Catechism. He wanted the catechumen to understand what he was learning, so the Decalogue, Lord's Prayer, and Apostles' Creed were divided into small sections, with each followed by the question \\"What does this mean?\\" Present Christian practice In no case is a catechumen absolutely bound to be baptized, preserving the principle that the recipient of a sacrament must not be forced against his will; the person concerned must be drawn spiritually to the faith in addition to being intellectually persuaded. The Roman Catholic Church revived the catechumenate with its Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA) wherein being a catechumen is one of a number of stages leading to receiving the sacraments of initiation (baptism, confirmation, and the Eucharist). This was a result of the Second Vatican Council, explicitly stated in point 64 of the Constitution of the Sacred Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Concilium: :The catechumenate for adults, comprising several distinct steps, is to be restored and to be taken into use at the discretion of the local ordinary. By this means the time of the catechumenate, which is intended as a period of suitable instruction, may be sanctified by sacred rites to be celebrated at successive intervals of time. The Neocatechumenal Way and the Light-Life Movement of the Roman Catholic Church take as their inspiration the old catechumenate of early Christianity (the \\"primitive church\\") as the basis for their goal of adult faith formation for Roman Catholics. In many Protestant churches, particularly those preferring not to baptise infants, the catechumenate status may be considered the norm amongst the young. This is especially true amongst young Christadelphians, although they never use the specific term catechumenate, more normally referring to those in this state as \\"being instructed\\" or \\"being taken through\\". The Protestant churches who baptize infants, for instance Anglican/Episcopalian and Lutheran, tend to follow a catechumenate which can be likened to a course in the fundamentals of the religion, lasting typically six months and ending with baptism at Easter. However, this is at the discretion of the local minister, and times may be varied. The 9th meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council in Cape Town, January 1993, stated among other points in Resolution 44: :\\"that the Provinces be encouraged to restore the catechumenate, or discipling process, to help enquiries move to Christian faith, using the witness and support of lay people, and liturgically celebrating the stages of growth;\\" Jehovah's Witnesses require a catechumenate of adherents prior to baptism by means of a study program led by a baptized minister, using a Watch Tower Society textbook that teaches basic Witness doctrines.\\"Laying a Foundation for the Right Kind of Ministers\\", The Watchtower, March 1, 1969, page 139. Students initially progress to become an \\"unbaptized publisher\\" of the faith, preaching while continuing further biblical instruction‚Äîakin to a catechumen, although the term is not specifically used. After demonstrating sufficient comprehension and application of Jehovah's Witnesses' interpretations of the Bible, the student qualifies to be baptized as a Jehovah's Witness.\\"Why Be Baptized\\", The Watchtower, April 1, 2002, pages 13. The catechumenate and the religious education of the young baptized A catechumen has not been baptized, and is undergoing training in the principles of the faith; one who was baptized as a child has an equal need of education, but this does not start from the same foundation, since baptism has already occurred. The theological basis is common to all sects and taken from the Gospel: from which the working of God on the catechumen is presupposed. Once baptized, the relationship with God is of a different order. Since the schisms between the parts of the Church, conversion between the denominations is also possible. Education in the specific doctrines of the sect is therefore seen as necessary, as well as a thorough grounding in the first principles of the faith. This latter may already have occurred when the convert is mature, and the status of catechumen is then usually not implied. The three cases - baptized as an infant, come to the faith in maturer years, and conversion from one denomination to another - seem outwardly similar. This has led to discussions on their differentiation, notably the International Anglican Liturgical Consultation which, at its meeting in Toronto in 1991, stated that the catechumenate for those about to be baptized as infants was to be absolved by their parents and sponsors, thus defining the catechumenate as necessary for all, whether directly or by proxy. The status of the \\"converted\\" was dealt with at the same time, but in a way that cannot be considered typical of general Christian thinking, when it was declared that rebaptism was not to be thought of; as a consequence the previously baptized cannot become catechumens. The remark in the foregoing section on \\"stages of growth\\" is important to understand this confusion, and happily this can also be seen as typical of the thinking outside the Anglican church. While all parts of the Church promote the growth from catechumen to novice to full member of the communion, the Protestant churches align it with the education of the young who are already baptized, whereas the Orthodox and Roman parts of the church keep this separate. Various terms are used to describe this process: \\"alpha courses\\", \\"nursery courses\\", \\"starter groups\\", among others. The main difference between denominations is whether these courses include or exclude those who are baptized, and an overlap with youth ministries and even to an extent with evangelism is observable. For further discussion not directly related to the state of catechumen, see other Wiki articles. The form of education varied, though the earliest recorded methods were lists of questions and answers (Catechism). Sermons were also used (Cyril of Jerusalem). Most catechisms were divided into parts, aiming to follow the spiritual growth of the catechumen. There were certain differences between catechisms for the young baptized and for the unbaptized catechumen. Catechumens and conversion The divergence between Christian practice as regards catechumens (a formalised, gradual approach) and the idea of conversion (a sudden, overwhelming event) as the entry into the Church, is one of appearance rather than substance. It is recorded in the Bible that Paul the Apostle, who started out as a Jewish persecutor of the Church, underwent sudden conversion on the way to Damascus when Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision. Regarded as the type of sudden conversion, this event was followed by baptism, with, however, a period of study and learning following, lasting a number of years. Jewish practice Quoting Shaye J. D. Cohen: From the Maccabees to the Mishnah (1987) \\"The Sadducees were the aristocratic opponents of the Pharisees. The Essenes were a group of religious and philosophic virtuosi, living a utopian life of the sort that would provoke the admiration of Jews and non-Jews alike. Josephus mentions their three-year catechumenate, their oath of loyalty to the group, their separation from their fellow Jews, their emphasis on purity and ablutions, but he regards them not as a 'sect' but as a pietistic elite.\\" See also proselyte.

The doors were made about 1175, in the reign of Mieszko III the Old, and are one of the most important works of Romanesque art in Poland. Placing the origin of the doors Locating the origin of the doors has been the subject of much discussion. It is clear that their style derives from the Mosan area in modern Belgium and France. Their place of manufacture has been argued to be Hildesheim (home of the famous Bernward Doors of about 1015), Bohemia, Flanders (perhaps Liege), or locally.Norman Davies's sources in God's Playground, p. 65, say Flanders about 1175. For Bohemia, see next note. Swartzenski says \\"design and wax model, Liege (?)\\" but \\"cast in Gniezno (?)\\", \\"soon after 1127\\", but this date now seems very much a minority view - it was the year when St Adalbert's head was \\"recovered\\", not having been with the initial batch of relics.Swartzenski, p.59 (note on Pl 116). Grove Art, \\"Romanesque, ¬ßVI: Metalwork\\" say \\"c. 1135, perhaps perhaps Bohemia\\", and \\"probably c. 1170\\" by imprted Mosan artists in different parts of the same article (accessed January 4th, 2010). Few non- Polish sources support local manufacture, despite the Polish emphasis in the iconography Another possibility is that the artists and craftsmen were imported from further West for the commission, perhaps easier than transporting the single piece of the left door, either in wax or bronze form, across much of Europe. At this time the Polish church had strong links with the Archdiocese of Cologne and the home area of Mosan art, which led Western European metalwork at this date. The question has not been settled by the discovery during restoration work in 1956 of partly effaced inscriptions reading \\"me fecit me...us\\", \\"petrus\\" and \\"bovo luitinius/latinus\\", probably giving the name of the craftsman in charge of the casting. These mean \\"made by\\" ... \\"Peter\\" ...\\" of ? [place]\\", with the \\"luitinius\\" location probably referring either one the four Lutins in modern Poland (not all possible candidates at this date), or Lille in northern France not far from the Mosan region, or Lucino near Como in northern Italy. If the reading is \\"latinus\\", or \\"Peter the Latin made me\\", the meaning is even less clear, but this is regarded as the less likely reading. Neither name is known in any other contexts.first link, , Description The left door (facing the reliefs from outside the cathedral) is 328 cm high and 84 cm wide, the right 323 cm high and 83 cm wide. Both are between 1.5 and 2.5 cm thick. They were cast in bronze using the lost wax casting technique in a mixture of copper, tin with a small amount of lead, with some fine detail being added after casting by engraving tools.Nesbitt, 214 The left leaf was cast in one piece, but the right was made in 24 cast sections which were then soldered together. Both the lion-headed knockers, which do not align correctly, were also cast separately and soldered. The doors of Hildesheim Cathedral, of about 1015, had pioneered the casting of a large door mostly covered with reliefs in a single piece, which was considerably more difficult than the usual technique of earlier Italian bronze doors, which used bronze relief casts fixed to a wooden core.Calkins, 103, Cambell, 318 Plain doors with no figurative decoration had already been cast whole in Germany - for example for Charlemagne's early 9th century Palatine Chapel at Aachen, following Roman techniques preserved by the Byzantines.Campbell, 318 The Gniezo left door follows the Hildesheim method. The relief is also typically much higher on the left door, as much as 75% on some figures, where few on the right door reach 25%. Around the central panels runs a decorative frieze of Mosan-style \\"rinceaux\\", or scrolling foliage, with small figures of astrological personifications and other subjects at intervals. Adalbert had been martyred trying to convert the pagan Prussians, who are shown in some scenes, giving a rare near-contemporary record of their appearance; the Prussians remained largely pagan at the time the doors were made. To illustrate the life of a single saint on such a monumental scale was most unusual at this period, and the doors are the only Romanesque ones in Europe with such a programme.Volume 1 of World Art: Themes of Unity in Diversity : Acts of the XXVIth International Congress of the History of Art, ed. Irving Lavin, p. 53, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, , Google books The designs perhaps followed a now lost cycle in an illuminated manuscript of the life of the saint, though even in this sort of works such an extended pictorial treatment of a saint's life was unusual. Two lives of Adalbert have survived, written around 1000, soon after his death, but no illuminated copies that throw light on the visual sources for the doors, though their texts help explain the scenes.Nesbitt, 214‚Äì215 Whatever the origin of the designs, the compositions show the borrowings from more common subject compositions to which early medieval artists usually resorted when confronted with a novel subject; devising new compositions was not part of their training. Some scenes adapt subjects from the Life of Christ and other models.

The entire development site covered an area of . On completion the development would have set to include offices, shops, restaurants, cafes, leisure/entertainment, fitness centre and hotel. It was to have been located next to Alpha Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Birmingham, on a place which was a multi-level underground car park in 2007. The total cost of the entire scheme was expected to be ¬£400 million and of the tower, ¬£150 million. The estimated date of completion was 2009. However, due to setbacks this was deemed unlikely and a later date of 2013 was presented by the developers and architects. In 2009, the developers received a 5-year extension to planning permission; the council turned down a 10-year extension in the hope that work would begin before 2015. Birmingham Post 6 November 2009 (Accessed 18 March 2011) The proposed scheme was cancelled during 2014 and alternative plans for the plans, which do not include a tall tower, were approved by Birmingham City Council. Original proposal The V Building was not part of the original plan for Arena Central which was submitted in 1998 by Miller Group. No buildings in the design were taller than 20 storeys. However, the design was soon changed and a tower was incorporated later in the year. The design, by HOK Architects, was for a 50-storey tower which had a total height of 245 metres to the top of the spire and a roof height of 187 metres. At the time, that would have made the tower the tallest building in England, and one of the tallest in Europe. The building plan was referred to Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, in 2000 who disapproved of the tower and forced it to be scaled down to 187 metres. The amendments to the design were made and the entire scheme later received outline planning consent. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 resulted in a number of setbacks for the project and it was significantly delayed. The building was considered a potential terrorist target if constructed and, in consequence, the Hampton Trust pulled out of the project as part owners. No news about the development was released for two years. In 2003, Andy Ruhan of Bridgewaters Capital was found as a partner and papers were signed in 2004.\\"Hampton Sell Arena Central\\", Skyscrapernews.com, 28 February 2003 (Accessed 18 March 2007) In December 2004, planning permission, which would have run out for the tower in February 2005, was extended to December 2010. Redesign and a new proposal =Early history= Due to the problems the project encountered, a new masterplan was being produced and Multiplex was awarded the contract for construction of the tower.\\"Mulitplex To Get Arena Central Contract\\", Skyscrapernews.com, 22 July 2004 (Accessed 18 March 2007) \\\\- \\"Arena Central Tower back on track\\", Emporis.com, 20 July 2004 (Accessed 18 March 2007) The masterplan unveiled in 2006, however, did not specifically outline the details of individual buildings. A model of the tower was present in the models, though the detail and the roof feature were not on the images released. The shape of the tower in the models confirmed that the design by HOK Architects was not to be used. It was described as going to appear as if it \\"is squeezed in the middle creating two bulges\\". A news article in the Estate Gazette on 17 June 2006 stated that the height of the tower would be 175 metres and the Civil Aviation Authority agreed that it would not have any problems with the tower if it was 175 metres tall; however, they would have to comment on the planning application if it did go any taller. Other news articles have also said that the tower will be of 47 storeys though whether this is in reference to the old design or the new design is unclear. In September 2006, it was revealed that despite Miller producing profits, the construction would be delayed yet again.\\"Miller group figures up again\\", Birmingham Post, 14 September 2006 (Accessed 18 March 2007) It was also revealed that the tower would be the first constructed part of the development due to the lack of demolition needed on the site. On 12 February 2007, Arena Central Developments was granted a 250-year lease on the land by Birmingham City Council.\\"City's tallest building granted lease\\", Birmingham Post, 13 February 2007 (Accessed 18 March 2007) =Team= Eric Kuhne of Eric R Kuhne & Associates and Civic Arts Architects was appointed by Dandara Ltd to design the form, the fa√ßades, the public realm, the lobbies and commercial tenancies of the tower. The apartments and the technical delivery have been designed by Scott Brownrigg Architects, with whom Eric Kuhne and Civic Arts Architects collaborated. =The design is revealed= The first indication of the design of the tower was revealed on the Pipers Models website. The website presented images of a model of the building that had been produced for the developers to be unveiled at the upcoming MIPIM show in Cannes, France. The design shown was different from what was quoted as having been \\"squeezed in the middle creating two bulges\\". Instead the design featured a tower of a 'V' shape rising from the base. The tower was unveiled at the MIPIM show in Cannes in March 2007. Its name had been changed from Arena Central Tower/ Arena Square Tower to V Building highlighting the 'V' shape on the Suffolk Street Queensway elevation.\\"A v-exciting new look for Brum\\", Birmingham Mail, 14 March 2007 (Accessed 18 March 2007) \\\\- \\"Kuhne's Arena Central tower unveiled at MIPIM\\", Building, 15 March 2007 (Accessed 18 March 2007) It was initially quoted as having 50 storeys and being 150 metres tall.\\"City's tallest skyscraper on show\\", BBC News, 14 March 2007 (Accessed 18 March 2007) The detailed planning application for the tower was submitted to the Birmingham City Council Planning Department on 13 June 2007 by agents Aims Ltd.\\"The V Building goes into planning\\", Emporis.com, 20 June 2007 (Accessed 13 July 2007) The planning application for the tower also contained changes to the masterplan for the site. The proposal was described as: > Erection of new tower to include flats, restaurant & bar together with > landscaping, car parking & means of access. Updated masterplan for the Arena > Central site, bound by Broad Street, Suffolk Street Queensway, Holliday > Street & Bridge Street, in accordance with condition 3 attached to > application No. C/04238/97/OUT The tower was approved by Birmingham City Council Planning Department on 4 October 2007. The Birmingham Post reported that it took two minutes for the councillors to make the decision. Construction of the tower was expected to begin in early 2008 for completion in 2013.\\"V Building gets the go-ahead\\", Birmingham Post, 4 October 2007 (Accessed 5 October 2007) =Design= The design of the tower had changed slightly from what was revealed at the MIPIM show in Cannes. The exterior of the building was a mixture of cladding with bars running across the windows.\\"V Tower Render\\", Skyscrapernews However, this was changed when the new renders for the tower were revealed after the submission of the planning application. The new renders showed the exterior to be brighter in colour.\\"V Building render\\", Building The planning application explained that the reasoning behind the height decrease from 175 metres to 147 metres was due to the refusal from the adjacent hotel building, Crowne Plaza, to move out of its building and be given hotel space in the new tower, which would have increased the height to 175 metres. The owners of Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, had submitted a planning application before the application for V Building to refurbish the hotel. At street level, near the entrance, there was to have been a plaza area which will consist of vertical concrete slabs with inscriptions written into them. The first two floors will be of double height, containing a restaurant and lounge for residents. The second floor will be cantilevered over the entrance. Beneath these would have been a two-storey underground car park. The footprint was decreased from that of the tower approved in the 2000 masterplan. This was to complement the residential use of the building, which had been proposed as mixed-use in the 2000 masterplan. Whilst the roof height was planned to be 147 metres, the fa√ßade overrun increased the overall height to 152 metres. The roof line has a serrated edge. On the 50th floor there was plannend to have been a sky bar with a public viewing platform, which was to have extended to a height of three storeys, above which there would have been will be a plant room. There was to be a total of 706 apartment units in the tower, 60 of which were to have been serviced suites. Facilities for the residents include a lounge on the ground floor and a library. Residents were to have had their own entrance to the building. This would provide access to the residents' reading room. A hotel- style lobby of would have provided public access to the three restaurants and the top floor sky bar.

Originally the United Kingdom was the primary source of this aid, but they withdrew in 1952, to be replaced by the United States.Edmond J. Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia: From Empire to People's Republic (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 79 Between 1950 and 1970, one source estimated that Ethiopia received almost US$600 million in aid, $211.9 million from the US, $100 million from the Soviet Union and $121 million from the World Bank.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, pp. 284-5n Sweden trained the Imperial Bodyguard and India at one point contributed the majority of foreign-born schoolteachers in the Ethiopian educational system.Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia, p. 78 This aid dried up under the military regime that followed the Ethiopian Revolution, except for food aid during the early- to mid-1980s famine. While the Soviet Union provided extensive amounts of aid, either directly or through its allies like East Germany and South Yemen, this was predominantly in the form of either military aid, or ideological education; these ended with the close of the Cold War. Large aid inflows resumed in the early 1990s aimed at reconstruction and political stabilization but declined during the war with Eritrea. The post-2000 period, however, has seen a resumption of large disbursements of grants and loans from the United States, the European Union, individual European nations, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank. These funds totaled US$1.6 billion in 2001. In 2001 Ethiopia qualified for the World Bank-International Monetary Fund- sponsored Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt reduction program, which is designed to reduce or eliminate repayment of bilateral loans from wealthy countries and international lenders such as the World Bank. In Ethiopia's case, the program aims to help stabilize the country's balance of payments and to free up funds for economic development. A noteworthy advance toward these goals came in 1999, when the successor states to the former Soviet Union, including Russia, cancelled US$5 billion in debt contracted by the Derg, a step that cut Ethiopia's external debt in half. HIPC relief is expected to total almost US$2 billion. In November 2007 the magazine The Economist reported that there was tangible evidence that the foreign aid given to Ethiopia reaches the people it is meant to, based on a visit to the south of the country. Roads, schools and water systems are being built and \\"there are few complaints about corruption, a fact that continues to make Ethiopia popular with foreign donors\\". However, the article also notes that, despite almost a decade of well-intentioned development policies, Ethiopians remain mired in the most wretched poverty.The Economist, November 3, 2007, \\"Briefing Ethiopia,\\" p. 32 In March 2010, the BBC claimed that it had evidence that millions of dollars earmarked for victims of the Ethiopian famine of 1984‚Äì85 went to buy weapons. Rebel soldiers apparently diverting the funding to their organisation in an attempt to overthrow the government. Their data were confirmed by participants and eye-witnesses of the time. However, following a complaint from the Band Aid Trust, the Editorial Complaints Unit of the BBC carried out \\"an investigation\\" and concluded that the reporting had no evidence to support it, and the BBC apologized to the Trust for the \\"misleading and unfair representation it created\\". .

The roads in the estate are all named after rivers. 51.8% of housing is privately owned, and 42.6% is rented from either the Newport City Council or local housing associations, such as Charter Housing. Bettws has Europe's second largest council estate. In 2009 Newport City Council transferred ownership of their social housing and most of the land they owned in the area to Newport City Homes, a housing association.

It lies between Glenwood and Norman, on the Caddo River. It is best known as the area in which explorer Hernando de Soto and his forces clashed with the Tula tribe, a band loosely affiliated with the Caddo Confederacy. The expedition described the Tula Indians as the fiercest they had faced during their inward journey into North America.Carter, Cecile Elkins. Caddo Indians: Where We Come From. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001: 21. After this, the expedition turned back east, making it as far as the Mississippi River, where de Soto died. It is contested as to whether he died of fever, or from a wound received during the fighting. There the expedition had a secret burial ceremony and sent his body into the river. A monument to this event stands in the heart of the small community, which now has a population of fewer than 100.

The song \\"Mushaboom\\" by Nova Scotia-born Canadian musician Feist is named after this community. The name Mushaboom is likely a shortened form of the Mi'kmaq word Moosaboon-elagwaak which means \\"a pile of hair\\". Mi'kmaq legend says that fairies would play ball and run, pulling at one another's hair as they did so. They would pull so hard that locks of hair would come away and then the fairies would scatter the locks on the ground. An early name for the settlement was \\"Winchelsea Harbour\\", likely named for a ship on which the founders of Halifax arrived in 1749. The area was barren and unsettled in 1818, but by 1827, 14 families lived here and the community was referred to as '\\"Taylor's Bay\\" or \\"Chelsea Bay\\". Mushaboom is located primarily on the eastern shore of Mushaboom Harbour. Taylor Head Provincial Park comprises the western shore of the harbour. Numerous islands are located in the harbour, the largest of which include Malagash Island and Boutilier Island. Various coves along the harbour indent the coastline of the community. A beluga whale sanctuary had been proposed between two islands south of the community, in a passage known locally as \\"The Gates\\".

Gruss's research has generally covered the topic of control mechanisms in the development of mammals, especially in the development of the nervous system. He has been able to produce insulin using stem cells.  Biography  Gruss grew up in the town of Alsfeld in the German state of Hesse. After gaining his university-entrance qualification (Abitur), he embarked on a degree in biology at Darmstadt University of Technology in 1968, graduating from the Institute of Microbiology in 1973. From 1974 to 1977, Peter Gruss worked on his Ph.D. on the subject of a tumor virus at the Institute for Virus Research at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg. He then spent a year as an assistant at the German Cancer Research Center. In 1978 he went to the US as a post doc in receipt of a fellowship grant to continue studying tumor viruses at the Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda/Maryland. From 1982 to 1986 Gruss was a professor at the University of Heidelberg's Institute of Microbiology. He was on the board of directors of the university's molecular biology institute, the ZMBH, from 1983. During this time, he organised several international molecular biology symposia. In 1986, Gruss was appointed a scientific member and director of the Department of Molecular Cell Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen. He is honorary professor at University of G√∂ttingen. He is a member of the board at Deutsche Venture Capital, and chairman of DeveloGen. In early 2015, Gruss has begun to develop the \\"Siemens Technology & Innovation Council\\" (STIC), which is an advisory board intended discuss technologies and innovations that will play a significant role for Siemens over the next ten years and beyond. Gruss chairs the Council and decides on its orientation. see Peter Gruss sucht f√ºr Siemens nach Trends, in: Produktion.de, January 2015 (German)  Scientific focus  Gruss's work focused on gene regulation processes. He was particularly interested in the genetic and cellular- biological building blocks that switch genetic programmes on and off in tumour viruses and in the course of embryonic development. In experiments on mice, he successfully identified significant controlling genes (known as Pax genes) which regulate the development of various organs. A study of the pancreas which he conducted enabled him to detect genes involved in the development of insulin-producing islets of Langerhans. This also provided the basis for differentiating stem cells in insulin-producing cells.Ahmed Mansouri, Marc Hallonet, Peter Gruss: Pax genes and their roles in cell differentiation and development, in: Current Opinion in Cell Biology 8 (1996), Pages 851‚Äì857  Work as president of the Max Planck Society  Upon taking office, Gruss was regarded by the press as an \\"American-style man of action\\" and an \\"unassuming high flyer\\".Eckart Henning and Marion Kazemi: Chronik der Kaiser-Wilhelm-/Max- Planck-Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaften 1911-2011 ‚Äì Daten und Quellen, Duncker und Humblot, Berlin 2011, Seite 32http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-22842759.html J√∂rg Blech, Olaf Stampf: Im W√ºrgegriff der B√ºrokratie, in: Spiegel 24/2002 (interview with Peter Gruss, in German)https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/forschung-der-neue- praesident-der-max-planck-gesellschaft-158755.html Matthias Brunnert: Der neue Pr√§sident der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 14. Juni 2000 In his inaugural speech, Gruss focused on the financial scope for science: he called for the introduction of a collective bargaining law specifically for the field of science to enable Germany to attract the world's best scientists. He also spoke out in favour of a reliable financial framework: \\"Only adequate rates of increase ‚Äì predefined for a lengthy period of time ‚Äì for the budget of the MPS can guarantee planning security\\".Translated from German, see http://www.pro- physik.de/details/physikjournalIssue/1089825/Issue_7_2002.html#1091687Neuer MPG-Pr√§sidente warnt vor K√ºrzungen, Physik Journal 1 (2002), Nr. 7/8, page 10 The institutes were faced with potentially having to make cuts in their budgets after the Society's budget had not been raised as much as requested in past years. Gruss pointed out on numerous occasions that the appointment of directors at the Max Planck Society involved competing with some of the world's leading research institutions: \\"Yet we at Max Planck are not competing with the average ‚Äì we are competing with the Harvards, the Cambridges and ETH Zurichs of this world\\".http://www.zeit.de/2008/40/P-Peter-Gruss Andreas Sentker, Martin Spiewak: Denken braucht Freiheit : Peter Gruss sucht als Pr√§sident der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft weltweit nach den kl√ºgsten K√∂pfen, (interview with Gruss) He went on to say that Germany was not internationally competitive when it came to pay, but that the Max Planck Society was largely able to offset this disadvantage due to the support it enjoyed from the Max Planck Foundation and thanks to its world-renowned planning security.http://www.zeit.de/2008/40/P-Peter-Gruss Andreas Sentker, Martin Spiewak: Denken braucht Freiheit : Peter Gruss sucht als Pr√§sident der Max- Planck-Gesellschaft weltweit nach den kl√ºgsten K√∂pfen (interview with Gruss) A first step towards improving the financial conditions for top scientists from overseas was the Freedom of Science Initiative of the German Government, which has offered non-university research institutions new financial freedoms since 2009.http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/peter-gruss-deutschland-soll-erfinden- nicht-imitieren/1537226.html Peter Gruss: Deutschland soll erfinden, nicht imitieren, Interview mit Amory Burchard vom Tagesspiegel, 16.6. 2009 During Gruss's term in office, numerous institutes were reorganised or newly established: The MPI for Research on Collective Goods and the MPI for Ornithology had their status raised from research group to institute; the MPI for History was reorganised to become the MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, while the MPI for Biology of Ageing and the MPI for the Science of Light were newly established.Eckart Henning and Marion Kazemi: Chronik der Kaiser-Wilhelm-/Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaften 1911-2011 ‚Äì Daten und Quellen, Duncker und Humblot, Berlin 2011, Seite 33 The Max Planck Florida Institute marks the first institute of the Max Planck Society to be established outside of Europe; it is funded by the State of Florida and the local county.

The Society's international networking is particularly successful: After the publication of news on the foundation of the Florida Institute, which came to be seen as a \\"model\\", the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the MPS had received requests from Canada and South Korea to establish institutes there. More than 40 per cent of the recently appointed Directors at the MPS are from outside of Germany, and 25 per cent of all Directors in the Max Planck Society are of non-German origin. In an interview published by Spiegel Online, Gruss outlined a new strategy for establishing \\"Max Planck Centers\\" for cooperating with foreign research institutions; some of these are already in place in cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires and New Delhi.http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,722935,00.htmlHans- Christoph Keller: Wer stehen bleibt, f√§llt zur√ºck (Interview mit Gruss vom 24. Oktober 2010)  Technology transfer  Gruss championed the cause of transferring his findings into practical application: he co-funded the biopharmaceutical company DeveloGen AG in G√∂ttingen (now part of Evotec) in 1997 together with fellow developmental biologists Herbert Jaeckle (Max Planck Society), Wolfgang Driever (University of Freiburg) and the entrepreneur Herbert Stadler. The company concentrated on developing new treatments for metabolic and endocrinological diseases with a special focus on diabetes.  Awards and distinctions  Gruss has won various awards for his research. In 1994 he was awarded the most highly endowed prize in German science, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. In 1995 he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine . In 1999 he was honored with the German Future Prize (the Federal President's Prize for Science and Technology) for his studies in molecular biology and the potential development of therapeutic procedures which they enabled. He received this prize together with Herbert J√§ckle.http://www.wissenschaft.de/wissenschaft/hintergrund/173008.html Gruss received the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2009.see his CV with the Max Planck Society http://www.mpg.de/183920/CV_Peter_Gruss.pdf Some of his other awards arehttp://www.mpg.de/183920/CV_Peter_Gruss.pdf * 1992 Feldberg Prize * 1995 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine * 1999 Science Prize of the Donors' Association for the Promotion of Science and Humanities in Germany * 2004 Lower Saxony State Prize * 2017 Harnack medal of the Max Planck Society  Memberships  Gruss is a member of various national and international research committees, among others: * American Academy of Arts and Sciences * Since 1996: G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences * Since 1995: German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina * 1993-1997: President of the International Society of Developmental Biology Other organisations of which he is a member are: * 2000-2002: President of the EMBL-Council (and German delegate from 1992 to 2000) * 2003: Steering Committee of the \\"National Genome Research Network\\" of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research * 2006-2008: \\"Council for Innovation and Growth\\" of the Federal GovernmentOfficial CV at http://www.mpg.de/183920/CV_Peter_Gruss.pdf References  External links  * Homepage of Gruss at the Max Planck Society Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Alsfeld Category:German biologists Category:German microbiologists Category:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners Category:Max Planck Society people Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art Category:Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt alumni ","title":"Peter Gruss"},{"id":"3898893","text":"St. Kliment Ohridski Base (, ) is a Bulgarian Antarctic base on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands.

He was fascinated with the ever-increasing popularity of hot air balloons, and became a balloon pilot, ascending at least three times before he disappeared while attempting an ascension on a balloon from Havana's Campo de Marte (today, Parque de la Fraternidad Americana) on June 28, 1856. A few days earlier he had made a successful attempt, flying several miles. His second try, however, became part of Cuba's folklore: when somebody or something disappears into thin air, Cubans say: \\"Vol√≥ como Mat√≠as P√©rez\\" (flew away like Mat√≠as P√©rez). Early career Mat√≠as P√©rez, originally a Portuguese citizen, moved to Cuba and started a successful business selling canopies and awnings. He was known as \\"The king of the canopies\\" at the time. But it is said that he always had an interest in aeronautics. Before buying a balloon from the French pilot Eug√®ne Godard, Mat√≠as had a friendly relationship with the pilot, and they had taken flight together from Havana on May 21, 1856. Interest in aeronautics and famous flights Don Mat√≠as P√©rez was not the first aeronautic pilot on Cuban soil. Before him were Frenchman Eugenio Robertson, who took flight on March 19, 1828, French born Adolfo Theodore, who made 3 ascensions in 1830, and Cuban Domingo Blineau (credited as the first Cuban to build a balloon from scratch and personally produce hydrogen gas for fuel). The list goes on, and includes the famous French pilot Eug√®ne Godard, who flew his balloon Ville de Par√≠s (City of Paris) many times in the island, before selling it to Mat√≠as P√©res for 1200 hard pesos. Godard was a reputed balloon pilot and builder. He built his first prototype in 1845, and launched several models within the following year. Godard had constructed a balloon called Ville de Par√≠s in 1850, in which he gained notoriety on October 6 by flying from Paris to Gits. The aircraft Mat√≠as P√©rez would buy in 1856 was also called Ville de Par√≠s. Whether this was the same balloon is disputed since there exists an eyewitness report that the original was destroyed by fire in Marseille just a month after its famous flight. Once Mat√≠as procured the ship, he sought permission to fly it in a letter to Captain General Jos√© Guti√©rrez de la Concha. The first flight took place on June 12, 1856 with excellent atmospheric conditions. The second flight took place on July 28, 1856http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/cultural-news/curiosities/flew-away-like- matias-perez-20121006/. Local newspapers reported that the wind was strong the day the flight was scheduled, causing Mat√≠as to delay his ascent. He finally decided to ascend at sunset around 7:00 PM and was never seen again. His disappearance earned him a place in Cuban history and popular culture. In popular culture First Day envelope dedicated to Mat√≠as P√©rez His disappearance coined the popular century-old phrase \\"Vol√≥ como Mat√≠as P√©rez\\" (Flew like Mat√≠as P√©rez) used in occasions when a person wants make emphasis about some other missing person or object. Coprefil, the Cuban official agency responsible for design, production and sales of stamps, celebrated Mat√≠as P√©rez 100th anniversary flight with a First Day Edition, on June 29, 1956, and honored him again as one of Cuba's first pilots with two stamps, value 3 and 13 cents respectively showing Plaza de Marte, the location from where he departed, and the Chorrera Fort, where he landed after his first successful trip in 1856. In 1969, the story of Mat√≠as P√©rez was translated into a recurring comic series by artist Luis Lorenzo Sosa. This science fiction adventures claims the pilot was abducted by an alien race and taken away to the far away planet of Strakon. It was released by Abril Publishing House on a weekly basis, in the Pionero Magazine.

This higher education concept is distinct from the elementary and high school \\"integrated curriculum\\" movement. Term and concept  Integrative Learning comes in many varieties: connecting skills and knowledge from multiple sources and experiences; applying skills and practices in various settings; utilizing diverse and even contradictory points of view; and, understanding issues and positions contextually.\\" > ...making connections within a major, between fields, between curriculum, > cocurriculum, or between academic knowledge and practice.\\" Huber, M. T., > Hutchings, P., & Gale, R. (2005). Integrative Learning for Liberal > Education. peerReview, Summer/Fall. Integrated studies involve bringing together traditionally separate subjects so that students can grasp a more authentic understanding. Veronica Boix Mansilla, cofounder of the Interdisciplinary Studies Project at Project Zero, explains \\"when [students] can bring together concepts, methods, or languages from two or more disciplines or established areas of expertise in order to explain a phenomenon, solve a problem, create a product, or raise a new question\\" they are demonstrating interdisciplinary understanding. For over a decade, Project Zero researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education have been studying interdisciplinary work across a range of settings. They have found interdisciplinary understanding to be crucial for modern-thinking students. Developing a cognitive and social model of interdisciplinary learning is still a challenge.

International Journal of Science Education, 37 (17), 2809-2835. Edutopia highlighted Central York High School as a \\"School That Works\\" because of its successful integrated studies approach. For example, an AP government teacher and art teacher collaborated to create a joint project that asked students to create a sculpture based on the principles presented by the AP government class. AP government teacher Dayna Laur states that, \\"Integrated studies projects [aim to] create a connectedness between disciplines that otherwise might seem unrelated to many students. Deliberately searching for ways in which you can mingle standards and content is imperative if you want to create truly authentic experiences because, in the world outside of the classroom, content is not stand-alone.\\"Central York High School - New High School Homepage 1 Concept map describing activities offered by universities to encourage integrative learning.  Integrated medical curriculum  In many American medical schools, an integrated curriculum refers to a non-compartmentalized approach to basic science learning. As opposed to traditional medical curriculum, which separate subjects such as embryology, physiology, pathology and anatomy, integrated curricula alternate lectures on these subjects over the course of the first two years. (Jonas 1989) The course of study is instead organized around organ systems (such as \\"Cardiovascular\\" or \\"Gastrointestinal\\"). Another major component of the integrated medical curriculum is problem-based learning. K-12 outcomes Interdisciplinary curricula has been shown by several studies to support students‚Äô engagement and learning. Specifically integrating science with reading comprehension and writing lessons has been shown to improve students‚Äô understanding in both science and English language arts.

It was founded in 1967, \\"with a vision of creating a residential college merging the best attributes of a small college with an undergraduate education focusing on public affairs and firmly rooted in liberal arts\\";James Madison Alumni Information the college was named after James Madison in honor of his role in writing the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and The Federalist Papers (which form part of the College's core curriculum). Originally considered experimental, the college has since come to be recognized as among the best in the nation.Goode, Stephen. \\"Winning Colleges.\\" Insight. 2 October 2000. http://www.cccnews.net/college/guide/insight30.htm The college was developed as part of MSU president John A. Hannah's attempts to increase the profile of the university and to capitalize off of the international and federal government contacts developed by the otherwise ignominious MSU Vietnam Project. The Lyman Briggs College was also founded in 1967 on the same general principle as James Madison College, though teaching the natural sciences rather than public policy and political theory. A playful rivalry has since developed between the two colleges. A third college on the same general model and focusing on the humanities, the Residential College in Arts & Humanities, opened in 2007. The administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, seminar rooms, and the library for the college are housed completely in Case Hall, where all James Madison students (also called \\"Madisonites\\" or \\"Madisonians\\") are required to live during their freshman year.James Madison Handbook About 320 students are admitted into the college each year, with the total student body currently around 1200.http://jmc.msu.edu/history/quick-facts.php Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and are taught almost exclusively by tenure track faculty with PhDs or occasionally PhD candidates.Quick Madison Facts Due to the restricted class size, enrollment in required courses can quickly fill up and many students find themselves on waiting lists. James Madison College also has a relatively large number of academically successful students; about 15% of its students are in the Honors College and the college generally represents about 35% of the Phi Beta Kappa graduates at MSU each year (while representing only about 4% of the total graduates). Madison boasts numerous major award recipients, including 6 Rhodes Scholars, 11 Truman Scholars, 13 Fulbright Scholars, 8 Marshall Scholars, 4 National Science Foundation Fellows, and 4 George Mitchell Fellows.https://nifs.msu.edu/hall-fame Majors Majors are chosen at the end of the freshman year, during which all students are required to take yearlong introductory courses in writing and public affairs: Identity and Community: An Approach to Writing, and Introduction to the Study of Public Affairs, respectively. The first semester of Introduction to the Study of Public Affairs (MC 201) notably introduces its students to The Federalist Papers and Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America. All majors require two years of foreign language, two semesters of economics (which unlike the other requirements may be fulfilled through Advanced Placement or similar credit), and one Field Experience internship. The Field Experience requirement can be waived under some circumstances, including completing an approved Study Abroad program, having prior professional work experience, or completing a Senior Honors Thesis as part of the JMC Honors Program. Petitions for substitution of Field Experience are approved on a case-by-case basis. The James Madison majors are Comparative Cultures and Politics, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Social Relations and Policy. Among members of the Madison community, these are typically known by their acronyms, CCP, IR, PTCD,and SRP. =Comparative Cultures and Politics= The college's newest major, Comparative Cultures and Politics (CCP) started in the 2007-2008 academic year. It deals with the similarities and differences between cultures, and how cultures and the interaction between them affects politics and policy. CCP puts a much more explicit emphasis on interdisciplinarity than the other majors. CCP faculty include professors from the SRP and IR majors in addition to those who teach exclusively within the major. CCP's focus is on the understanding of culture and its effect on the domestic and international affairs of modern nation-states. The curriculum is divided into comparative studies and transnational studies. The comparative perspective in the curriculum (which informs the fall segment of the sophomore sequence) focuses on issues of nationalism, national identity, culture, and politics within individual countries, comparing them along the way. The transnational component (which informs the spring segment of the sophomore sequence) focuses on cultural interaction and cultural conflict. Upper-level courses address topics including identity performance, post-colonialism, visual culture, the refugee experience, gender and violent conflict. =International Relations= The International Relations (IR) curriculum is the largest major within James Madison College. It is organized around international security and conflict resolution; international political economy; global governance; foreign policy of the United States and other countries; and comparative, regional and cultural studies. The curriculum encourages students to think creatively about a variety of issues, such as what constitutes \\"national security\\", the social consequences of modernization, the causes and likely consequences of ethno-nationalism, how the United States arrives at foreign policy decisions, and how is that different from how foreign policies are made in other countries and the strengths and weaknesses of each. It addresses the impact of protectionist foreign trade policies, how national, regional and international political, social, and economic factors interact in the transition to a post-cold war global order, the impact of the United Nations and other international organizations, the effects of weapons and communications technologies on world politics, and the means by which national defense policies have been implemented since the end of World War II. Some classes use case studies in which students examine real or hypothetical foreign policy dilemmas and developing solutions to them, while others use evidence about the importance of theories and models for comprehending and influencing world events. =Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy= Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy (PTCD) probes the major competing principles that have animated political communities and attempts to translate them into practice and the complex fundamental questions in trying to sort out values and principles that have been most important to humankind. Such questions include what it means to flourish as a human being, what the rights and responsibilities of good citizens are, and what the best way of life is for society as a whole. The program seeks not to pretend to have the definitive answers to these questions, but rather to teach students how to think about these concepts and how to approach these questions in a productive and intellectually exciting way. To achieve this, the PTCD curriculum is designed to be both philosophical and historical. Course readings range from Plato and the classical poets to contemporary political theory, literature, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions. The introductory course sequence is not a conventional survey of political theory, but introduces students to a theoretical way of thinking about politics and morality, tracking the development of Western political thought over time from its origins in ancient Greek city-state, its revival in the Florentine republic, and its coalescence into the modern liberal democratic consensus during the Enlightenment, which they can then use as a basis of comparison in analyzing the American experience. Other required \\"core\\" courses confront students with the most systematic justifications philosophers have offered for one or another conception of justice and also the most challenging, sometimes unorthodox objections to grand theories of justice, including those of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche. In senior seminars, students can critically explore a focused topic in depth in such a way that many of the themes and questions that have been raised by the curriculum may be viewed in a new light. In addition, a wide range of electives, including courses on technology, religion and politics (including, recently, political Islam), the Supreme Court and African-American political thought, are available to allow students to pursue more specialized interests relevant to the general concerns of the field. After graduation, PTCD majors have gone on directly to work in a wide variety of public and private sector jobs. Many Political Theory graduates go on to graduate or professional school in law, business, philosophy, and political science. From there, their paths have taken many different turns, for example, serving in the Michigan Legislature, as Solicitor General of the State of Ohio, as Budget Director of the State of Michigan, as Executive Director of the Michigan Democratic Party, and teaching at major universities and small liberal arts colleges. The aforementioned features of the PTCD program make it relatively easy to pursue a dual major; many students combine a PTCD major with a major in another Madison core or a major in a disciplinary department. In recent years, PTCD students have dual majored in biochemistry, criminal justice, economics, English, history, mathematics, philosophy, political science, physics, psychology, religion, secondary education, sociology, and theater. PTCD was originally entitled Justice, Morality, and Constitutional Democracy (JMCD); the program was renamed and modified in 1991. It has, over its history, been accused of and praised for Straussian tendencies, and Allan Bloom (whose translation of Plato is in currency within PTCD) in particular praised the PTCD curriculum in a visit before his death. =Social Relations and Policy= The Social Relations and Policy (SRP) major explores the both social relations among groups and public policy. public issues It is explicitly historical and comparative, looking at social relations in the United States and internationally, over time. Courses focus on the interplay of such factors as class, race, ethnicity, sex/gender, religious belief and national identity. In addition, the program also teaches students how to analyze and investigate problems in public policy, such as health care, welfare policy, family policy, and immigration. The program uses the study of social relations and policy as a way to cultivate reasoning, methodological and analytical skills and the capacities for empathetic observation, normative judgment and effective problem solving. The sophomore sequence provides the conceptual, methodological and substantive bases for upper division work by introducing students to classical and contemporary social theory and comparative social history, and to quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The junior level builds on these skills to assess, in depth, a set of social problems and policy solutions. A senior seminar provides an opportunity to synthesize course work and undertake original research. Students also select from a broad range of electives to develop their expertise and understanding including opportunities for more international and comparative work, greater political analysis, and deeper understanding of particular forms of social relations. A related area requirement is broadly constructed to shape the major in a way that is responsive to individual interests and academic purpose. Substantively, courses in Social Relations take up issues such as social identity, inequality and mobility, wealth and poverty, assimilation and pluralism, prejudice and discrimination, intergroup conflict and cooperation, the problem of civil rights and the politics of equality. Students develop knowledge in such areas as immigration, race and ethnic relations, civil rights, family and children, housing and residential segregation, urban and metropolitan policy, schooling and educational policy, social security and social welfare policies. They can go into careers such as government, non- profit organizations, labor relations, human resources administration, law, teaching, educational administration, public lobbying, and many others. Minors James Madison College offers its students the opportunity to add one or more minors to their majors. These are: *Political Economy: The specialization in Political Economy offers a challenging, interdisciplinary course of study in economics and economic policy. Political Economy approaches the study of public affairs by incorporating economic, political, social, and historical considerations in the analysis. The program aims to foster a critical understanding of economic forces and their relationship to issues of prosperity and social justice.Political Economy Specialization http://jmc.msu.edu/specialization/pe/ *Science, Technology, Environment, and Public Policy Specialization (STEPPS): Focus on the history of science, the philosophy of science and the implications of technology on policy, as well as science and environmental policy. The program is conducted in conjunction with the Lyman Briggs College and the MSU Department of Fisheries and Wildlife within the College of Natural Science.STEPPS http://jmc.msu.edu/stepps/ *Muslim Studies: Area studies in the Muslim world, with a focus on the political dynamics of the region and the role of political Islam.Muslim Studies *Western European studies: Area studies in Western Europe, with a focus on European integration and the workings of the European Union.Specialization in Western European Studies Students may also combine their majors with other minors offered at Michigan State University outside the college. Student life James Madison College students play a prominent role in the political life of Michigan State University. Madison students form the majority of the leadership of both the Michigan State College Republicans and College Democrats; The Associated Students of Michigan State University; . James Madison also has its own student senate which acts as a liaison between faculty, staff and students. Various other political groups -- such as the university chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Young Democratic Socialists, and the MSU chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom; all meet in Case Hall and have a disproportionately Madison membership. Many Madison students are also involved in Model United Nations, including a competitive travelling team as well as a high school MUN conference held on campus every spring. =College traditions= James Madison College has a tradition of employing MSU's jazz band as accompaniment and entertainment for its commencement ceremony. The tradition dates to the early days of the College, apparently based on an early dean's personal liking for jazz. James Madison has an annual Parade of Honors, recognizing the many students who have received awards throughout the year.

History It was founded on 21 March 1957 (on the anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic's declaration in 1919), following the break of 1956 Hungarian Revolution. It claimed to represent all the country's youth and sought to educate young people politically and to supervise political as well as some social activities for them. KISZ was the most important source of new members for the party. Its organizational framework paralleled that of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and included a congress, central committee, secretariat, and regional and local committees. Membership was open to youth from the ages of fourteen to twenty- six years, but most of the full-time leaders of the organization were well over the age limit. In the 1980s, KISZ had about 800,000 members. Membership was common among students (96% at universities, 75% in high schools) but was lower among young people already working (31%). It was mandatory for university admittance. In April 1989 delegates to the organization's national congress voted to change the name of the organization to the Democratic Youth Federation (DEMISZ). According to declarations adopted by the congress, the newly refashioned federation would be a voluntary league of independent youth organizations and would not accept direction from any single party, including the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The members of the last KISZ Central Committee, however, filled strategic positions in the economy of the 3rd Hungarian Republic, e.g. Imre Nagy (Caola Inc. CEO), Lajos Csepi (president of the Hungarian Privatization and State Holding Co.), J√°nos G√∂nczi (Mal√©v CEO), Mih√°ly Enyedi-Nagy (founder of Media-ship in 1991), P√°l Jendrolovics and S√°ndor Sz√≥r√°di (Budapest Investment Inc. CEO), Gy√∂rgy Szilv√°sy (Altus Inc. CEO, from 2006 leader of the PM's Office). The former prime minister of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, had served as the president of the central committee of the University chapter of KISZ between 1988 and 1989. After that the organisation changed to Hungarian Democratic Youth League (, DEMISZ).

He was capped 19 times playing for Norway, and was a part of the Norwegian team who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics. He was later Secretary general of the Norwegian Football Association, and acted as head coach of the Norwegian national team. He is regarded as the architect behind the Norwegian \\"Bronze Team\\" that finished third in the 1936 Olympics. Personal life Halvorsen was born in Sarpsborg, the son of baker Christian Halvorsen and Jakobine Dorthea Thronsen. He established himself as a ship broker in Hamburg, and his first marriage was with a German citizen. He married for a second time in 1951 with Sigrid Helga Willadsen. Playing career Halvorsen was a centre-half who played 19 times for the Norwegian national team, and won the Norwegian Cup in 1917 as captain of Sarpsborg FK. Aged 18 years and 318 days, he is the youngest captain in a Norwegian Cup final. He made his debut for the national team in 1918, in a match against Sweden, and played four matches for the national team in 1918, and four matches in 1919. He represented Norway at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, where the Norwegian team reached the quarter finals. Between 1922 and 1934, Halvorsen played in Germany for Hamburger SV, where he won the German championships in 1923 and 1928. He played his last match for the national team against Germany in Hamburg in 1923, his nineteenth game for the national selection. Manager career  He returned to his home country in 1934, and was hired as secretary of the Norwegian Football Association, NFF. This job also made him head of the national team's selection committee, and in the years before World War II, he also acted as national team coach. With Halvorsen at the helm, Norway won the Bronze medals at the 1936 Olympics, and qualified for the 1938 World Cup. This was Norway's first and only appearance in the World Cup finals until the 1990s. World War II  During the war, Halvorsen was one of the figureheads of the Norwegian sports boycott. Practically all organized sport ceased its operations during the German occupation, and as a result, Halvorsen was arrested and placed in a concentration camp. He was imprisoned at M√∏llergata 19 for one day, then in Grini concentration camp from August 1942 to July 1943, then in Natzweiler- Struthof, Neckarelz and Vaihingen an der Enz concentration camps.

They were both named after Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, Count of Maurepas (from the city of Maurepas) who, as Minister of Marine, was in charge of French colonies and chief adviser to King Louis XVI. First Fort Maurepas (Red River): In 1734 two explorers returned from Lake Winnipeg to Fort Saint Charles on Lake of the Woods and reported that they had found a good site for a fort near the mouth of Red River of the North, or Maurepas River as they called it. While returning to Montreal, La V√©rendrye sent from Fort Kaministiquia Sieur Cartier, a merchant, with 12 men in 3 canoes to build a fort on the river. When he reached Fort Michilimackinac he ordered La Jemeraye to relieve his son Pierre at Fort Saint Charles so that Pierre assist at the new post. Since his son Jean-Baptiste had returned from the Indians, Jean-Baptiste went instead. The fort was five leagues up the Red River on high ground where the marshes end. The site has not been identified. MortonMorton, page 431 thinks it was on Nettley Creek which was called Rivi√©re Aux Morts from a massacre of Saulteurs by the Sioux. They explored the river from Lake Winnipeg almost to Pembina, North Dakota and opened a route from the Red River to Lake of the Woods via the Roseau River (Manitoba-Minnesota) and the Portage de la Savanne. In 1735 the fort produced 600 packages of furs. La V√©rendrye himself arrived in February 1737 after travelling overland and held council with the Indians. In May 1737 it was reported that all the Indians at the fort had died of pox. In 1738 La V√©rendrye returned, passing the fort on his way to found Fort La Reine on the Assiniboine River. By 1739 the fort was abandoned in favor of Fort Rouge upriver (south) at the present site of Winnipeg. Second Fort Maurepas (Winnipeg River): is poorly documented. One source Burpee cited in 'Historic Bas de la River' (in references) says that the fort was moved from the Red River to the Winnipeg River in 1739, but other sources do not repeat this. It was on a high round knoll on the right bank of the Winnipeg River about six miles above its mouth across from the modern Powerview-Pine Falls, Manitoba. In the winter of 1749-50 it was rebuilt by Pierre Gaultier de La V√©rendrye after it had been burnt by the Indians. By 1793 nothing was visible but the clearing. On the opposite side of the river at Otter Point the North West Company had a storehouse. About two miles downriver was Fort Bas de la Rivi√®re and further downriver was the later Fort Alexander, Manitoba. The region was known as Bas de la Rivi√®re.

They are used to bless the surrounding countryside and for other purposes. Prayer flags are believed to have originated with Bon. Barker, page 14 In Bon, shamanistic Bonpo used primary-colored plain flags in Tibet. Traditional prayer flags include woodblock-printed text and images. History Prayer flag at Sarchu. Close-up view of prayer flags. Lung ta prayer flags hang along a mountain path in Nepal. Nepal Sutras, originally written on cloth banners, were transmitted to other regions of the world as prayer flags.Barker, p. 13 Legend ascribes the origin of the prayer flag to the Gautama Buddha, whose prayers were written on battle flags used by the devas against their adversaries, the asuras.Beer, p. 60 The legend may have given the Indian bhikku a reason for carrying the heavenly banner as a way of signifying his commitment to ahimsa.Wise, pp. 11‚Äì12 This knowledge was carried into Tibet by 800 CE, and the actual flags were introduced no later than 1040 CE, where they were further modified. The Indian monk Atisha (980‚Äì1054 CE) introduced the Indian practice of printing on cloth prayer flags to Tibet and Nepal. During the Cultural Revolution, prayer flags were discouraged but not entirely eliminated. Many traditional designs may have been lost. Currently, different styles of prayer flags can be seen all across the Tibetan region. Lung ta/Darchog styles Prayer flags in the Qilian Mountains, China. Tibetan \\"lung ta\\" or \\"wind horse\\" from an 1895 book by Laurence Austine Waddell There are two kinds of prayer flags: horizontal ones, called Lung ta (Wylie: rlung-rta, meaning \\"Wind Horse\\") in Tibetan, and vertical ones, called Darchog (Wylie: dar-lcog, meaning \\"flagstaff\\"). Lung ta (horizontal) prayer flags are of square or rectangular shape, and are connected along their top edges to a long string or thread. They are commonly hung on a diagonal line from high to low between two objects (e.g., a rock and the top of a pole) in high places such as the tops of temples, monasteries, stupas, and mountain passes. Darchog (vertical) prayer flags are usually large single rectangles attached to poles along their vertical edge. Darchog are commonly planted in the ground, mountains, cairns, and on rooftops, and are iconographically and symbolically related to the Dhvaja. Color and order Prayer flags in Kathmandu, Nepal. Traditionally, prayer flags come in sets of five: one in each of the five colours that correspond with the 5 Elements of Chinese theory. The five colors are arranged from left to right in a specific order: blue, white, red, green, and yellow. The five colors represent the five elements and the Five Pure Lights. Different elements are associated with different colors for specific traditions, purposes and sadhana. Blue symbolizes the sky and space, white symbolizes the air and wind, red symbolizes fire, green symbolizes water, and yellow symbolizes earth. According to Traditional Tibetan medicine, health and harmony are produced through the balance of the five elements. Symbols and prayers The center of a prayer flag traditionally features a Lung ta (powerful or strong horse) bearing three flaming jewels (specifically ratna) on its back. The Ta is a symbol of speed and the transformation of bad fortune to good fortune. The three flaming jewels symbolize the Buddha, the Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and the Sangha (Buddhist community): the three cornerstones of Tibetan philosophical tradition. Surrounding the Lung ta are various versions of approximately 400 traditional mantras, each dedicated to a particular deity. These writings include mantras from three of the great Buddhist Bodhisattvas: Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), Avalokite≈õvara (Chenrezig, the bodhisattva of compassion, and the patron of the Tibetan people), and Manjusri. In addition to mantras, prayers for a long life of good fortune are often included for the person who mounts the flags. Images or the names of four powerful animals, also known as the Four Dignities, adorn each corner of a flag: the dragon, the garuda, the tiger, and the snowlion. Pray tag OM MANI PADME HUM refers to OM for symbolize your impure body speech and mind.MANI meaning jewel, symbolizes the factors of method‚Äîthe altruistic intention to become enlightened, compassion, and love. PADME meaning lotus, symbolize wisdom .HUM is the seed syllable of Akshobhya‚Äîthe immovable, the unfluctuating, that which cannot be disturbed by anything. Symbolism and tradition Traditionally, prayer flags are used to promote peace, compassion, strength, and wisdom. The flags do not carry prayers to gods, which is a common misconception; rather, the Tibetans believe the prayers and mantras will be blown by the wind to spread the good will and compassion into all pervading space. Therefore, prayer flags are thought to bring benefit to all. By hanging flags in high places the Lung ta will carry the blessings depicted on the flags to all beings. As wind passes over the surface of the flags, which are sensitive to the slightest movement of the wind, the air is purified and sanctified by the mantras. The prayers of a flag become a permanent part of the universe as the images fade from exposure to the elements. Just as life moves on and is replaced by new life, Tibetans renew their hopes for the world by continually mounting new flags alongside the old. This act symbolizes a welcoming of life's changes and an acknowledgment that all beings are part of a greater ongoing cycle. According to traditional belief, because the symbols and mantras on prayer flags are sacred, they should be treated with respect. They should not be placed on the ground or used on clothing. Old prayer flags should be burned. File:Swayambunathflags.jpgPrayer flags at Swayambunath, Kathmandu. File:Prayer flag above Tanze Gompa.jpgA Darchog prayer flag in northern India.

The best time to put up new prayer flags is in the morning on sunny, windy days. In Tibet, old prayer flags are replaced with new ones annually on the Tibetan New Year.

Opposite is the statue by John Steell of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the victor of the Battle of Waterloo, in which the Royal North British Dragoons participated as part of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, called the \\"Union Brigade\\". North Britain is a term which has been occasionally used, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, for either the northern part of Great Britain or Scotland, which occupies the northernmost third of the island. Its counterparts were South Britain, generally used to refer to England and Wales and West Britain, usually referring to Ireland. Origin Early uses of the designation have been noted after the 1603 Union of the Crowns of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. In early use the term could refer to inhabitants of Scotland as well as the country itself; since at least the late 15th century, \\"Britain\\" could be equivalent to \\"Briton\\", even being used interchangeably in early texts. Accordingly, \\"North Britain\\" was sometimes used as equivalent to \\"North Briton\\". Francis Bacon wrote in 1604 that the union made \\"The people to be the South-Brittains and North- Brittains\\". The Oxford English Dictionary cites the poet Richard Brathwait, the play Wit at Several Weapons, and Sir William Mure of Rowallan as early 17th-century appearances of the name for Scotland as a whole. King James VI and I, the first joint monarch of both kingdoms, used the terms \\"South Britain\\" and \\"North Britain\\" for England and Scotland respectively, most famously in his Proclamation of 1606 (here) establishing the first Union Flag, where Scotland and England are not otherwise named: This usage was repeated in Charles I's Proclamation of 1634 on the use of the flag, though adding England and Scotland too for explanation: Regimental colours of the 21st (Royal North British Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot depicted in 1849 After the Acts of Union 1707, Scotland was sometimes referred to as \\"North Britain\\" officially. In 1707, the Royal Scots Greys were renamed the \\"Royal North British Dragoons\\". Similarly, the \\"Scots\\" in the name of the Royal Scots Fusiliers was changed to \\"North British\\", a name which lasted until 1877, when it became the \\"21st (Royal Scots Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot\\". In 1712, The Boston News-Letter in British North America was using the term \\"North British\\". The Oxford English Dictionary cites Matthew Prior using the spelling \\"North Briton\\" in 1718. In Rob Roy (1817), Sir Walter Scott refers to a Scottish person in England as a North Briton, sometimes in the mouth of an English character but also in the authorial voice. The former Cowlairs railway works, factory of the North British Railway at Springburn, Glasgow Historic use \\"North Britain\\" is often used historically, referencing the time period before the formation of Scotland and England. As such, it forms a geographic, yet politically and culturally neutral description of the area.Examples of this usage are to be found in William Roy's Military Antiquities of the Romans in North Britain (1793) The term, particularly in adjective form, found use in the creation of the railway system. The North British Railway operated from 1846 to 1923, leaving a later legacy in the name of the North British Hotel in Edinburgh, which was renamed The Balmoral Hotel in the 1980s. The North British Locomotive Company existed from 1903 until its bankruptcy in 1962, again leaving a naming legacy in other organisations. North British Distillery Company sign The name is found in other private enterprises, examples being the Edinburgh North British Insurance Company, founded in 1809, and North British Distillery Company founded there in 1885. The North British Rubber Company was founded in 1856 in Edinburgh's Fountainbridge, notable for its Wellington boots and eventually becoming Hunter Boot Ltd. An example of its use in respect to northern Great Britain rather than Scotland can be found in the title of the North British Academy of Arts which existed from 1908 to 1924 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a city in northern England.Dominion, 9 January 1909, page 11e. The North Briton and New North Briton were newspapers in the 18th and 19th centuries, and in 1844 there was also a North British Advertiser. The North British Review was founded in 1844 by members of the Free Church of Scotland as a Scottish \\"national review\\" for those unsatisfied with the secular Edinburgh Review or the conservative Quarterly Review. It continued until 1871. In 1847 a North British Daily Mail was founded, which was renamed the Glasgow Daily Mail in 1901 and merged with the Glasgow Record the same year, ultimately becoming the Daily Record. Cousin Henry, one of Anthony Trollope's 1879 novels, was serialized in that year in the North British Weekly Mail. Particularly in the 19th century, \\"North Britain\\" or \\"N.B.\\" was widely used for postal addresses in Scotland. However, by the early 20th century, any vestiges of popular usage of this style had declined. \\"South Britain\\", the complementary style apportioned to England, had never seriously established itself, either north or south of the Anglo-Scottish border. At least two ships were named the SS North Britain: a 1940 vessel torpedoed in 1943, and the 1945 SS North Britain, which was built by Lithgows, Port Glasgow as the Empire Cyprus for the Ministry of War Transport. She was sold into merchant service in 1948 and renamed North Britain. In 1962, she was sold to Hong Kong and renamed Jesselton Bay, scrapped in 1968. 21st-century use In current usage, the northern parts of Great Britain are sometimes referred to simply as 'the North', though this term is more frequently used to describe northern England. This usage is often prevalent in social commentary on the suggested \\"North‚ÄìSouth divide\\".

During the 1980s, Garry Trudeau thought it would be fun to do a political parody of the television program Max Headroom (of which he was a fan). He combined the concept with then-president Ronald Reagan, to produce Ron Headrest, the world's first electronically simulated politician. (The name \\"Headrest\\" was a humorous allusion to the frequent and lengthy naps that Reagan was notorious for.) The idea was that Ron had been created to serve as a backup president during the long periods Reagan spent on vacation. He appeared as a stylized version of Reagan‚Äôs head and shoulders on a television screen, complete with sunglasses. Because he was electronic, he would have no memory troubles, and his sense of humor and attitude were designed to appeal to young voters. It ends up being a disaster: Headrest is stuttering and incompetent, and openly mocks the administration he is designed to serve, and causes nothing but trouble. During the first week of his appearance he flashes the White House's phone number on his screen and tells children to call if they wanted \\"rock- solid information on safe sex.\\" (Because the number printed was accurate, the real world White House got calls which jammed their switchboards. Eventually they got revenge by giving callers the number of Trudeau‚Äôs editor. ) In the continuity of the comic strip the White House staff is less creative, and simply try to turn Headrest off. But like his televised counterpart, Ron escapes into the airwaves and begins causing trouble wherever he can find a television and someone to listen to him. He takes particular delight in tormenting Mike Doonesbury, whom he calls \\"Y-Person\\" (meaning yuppie). Headrest also seeks the 1988 Republican Party presidential nomination in his own right, but withdraws from the race, promising to go into reruns instead. Ron appeared regularly throughout the Reagan and Bush presidencies and then began to show up less frequently. He only appeared a few times during the Clinton administration, and then disappeared entirely. The real Ronald Reagan had retired and left the public view, and Max Headroom's program was long gone, making the character far less topical than he had once been.

The public open space, which covers , is all that remains of the historic Hounslow Heath which covered more than . The present day area is bounded by A315 Staines Road, A3063 Wellington Road South, A314 Hanworth Road, and the River Crane. History The heathland of Hounslow Heath originally covered an area underlain by Taplow gravel that now includes parts of Bedfont, Brentford, Cranford, Feltham, Hampton, Fulwell, Hanworth, Harlington, Harmondsworth, Heston, Hounslow, Isleworth, Stanwell, Teddington, Twickenham, and Heathrow. Hounslow Heath has had major historical importance, originally crossed by main routes from London to the west and southwest of Britain. Staines Road, the northern boundary of the present heath, was the Roman Road, Via Trinobantes. There are several historic references to Roman camps on or close to the heath. Continuous recorded history dates back to Norman times. In 1546, Hounslow Heath was surveyed with a recorded area of (6.71 square miles). Various armies used the heath due to its proximity to London, Windsor and Hampton Court. Oliver Cromwell stationed an army there at the end of the English Civil War in 1647. James II camped his army there, and conducted military exercises and mock battles to try to intimidate the population in London. In 1793, Hounslow Barracks was built to the north of Staines Road as part of the preparations to meet a possible French invasion. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the heath was notorious as the haunt of highwaymen and footpads, being crossed by the Great West Road and the Bath Road.Hounslow Online hounslowtw3.net The eventual mapping of the whole of the United Kingdom by the Ordnance Survey began with the measuring of an accurate base-line on Hounslow Heath, chosen for its flatness and its relative proximity to the Royal Greenwich Observatory. A sighting was made of the spire of All Saints' church in Banstead, and along that line a length of 27,400 feet was very precisely measured. This work by General William Roy was the start of the Anglo-French Survey (1784‚Äì1790), which led to the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. By 1900, the heath was still in use as a training ground for horse-mounted cavalry based at Hounslow Barracks, a gun shooting range, and adjacent army medical units including an isolation hospital. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Hounslow Heath Aerodrome was established, that developed to become a fighter aircraft defence and training base. In 1919, the aerodrome became the sole London Terminal Aerodrome, and hosted the first scheduled daily international commercial air services. In 1920, it surrendered its role to Croydon Airport, and closed. The heath was then again used for military training and a repair depot. On the south side of Staines Road, to the north of the Heath, is a monument, now in a state of neglect, commemorating the first flight to Australia, a modified Vickers Vimy bomber G-EAOU, flown by Australian brothers Keith and Ross Smith, which took off from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 12 November 1919 and arrived in Darwin on 10 December. A plaque marks the entrance to London's first civil airport, stating: \\"London Terminal Aerodrome Hounslow Heath August 1919 - 1920. From here the first British international airline operation and the first flight from Europe to Australia was made. Erected by the Heston and Isleworth Borough Council\\". On 10 April 2016, another memorial to the aerodrome was unveiled and dedicated by the Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust immediately south of the car park beside the Staines Road. An area to the west of the present heath was used for gravel extraction after World War II. Used for landfill until the late 1960s, the land was reclaimed to form Hounslow Heath Golf Centre which opened in 1979. Archaeology Bronze Age spearheads, axes, and sword and knife fragments from Hounslow, are held at the British Museum, also Celtic badges and amulets discovered in a field at Hounslow in 1864. In 1999, excavations on the former Feltham Marshalling Yards to the south of the heath unearthed remains of an Iron Age furnace and post holes from a round house. There are various remains of former mills and other industrial archaeological features adjoining the River Crane near the heath. This part of the river is classified as an Archaeological Priority Area.About The Heath hounslow.info Nature reserve Dragonfly sculpture at Hounslow Heath, looking west, adjacent to the rangers' yard near the Staines Road main entrance Hounslow Heath is a designated local nature reserve and Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation, and is made up of lowland heath, dry acid grassland, woodland, scrub, neutral grasslands, wetlands, wildflower meadows, providing a wild, rugged country setting with a large network of paths.Hounslow Parks & Open Spaces hounslow.info See also *Hounslow parks and open spaces Notes External links * Hounslow Council website: Parks and Open Spaces Category:Local nature reserves in Greater London Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Heaths of the United Kingdom Category:History of Middlesex ","title":"Hounslow Heath"},{"id":"3899122","text":"Penis plant is a common name for several plants and may refer to: * Echinopsis lageniformis, also known as Bolivian torch cactus, which grows in Bolivia * Amorphophallus titanum, also called titan arum, from Indonesia ","title":"Penis plant"},{"id":"3899127","text":"Some edits to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia by staff of the United States Congress have created controversy, notably in early to mid-2006. Several such instances, such as those involving Marty Meehan, Norm Coleman, Conrad Burns, and Joe Biden, received significant media attention. The activities documented included: * rewriting Norm Coleman's article to make more favorable, said to be \\"correcting errors\\"; * removing from Conrad Burns' article quoted pejorative statements he had made, and replacing them with \\"glowing tributes\\" such as \\"the voice of the farmer\\"; and * removal of unfavorable information from Joe Biden's article. Others, such as those involving Gil Gutknecht, were reported but received less widespread coverage. Biographical information on various politicians was edited by their own staff to remove undesirable information (including pejorative statements quoted, or broken campaign promises), add favorable information or \\"glowing\\" tributes, add negative information to opponents' biographies, or replace the article in part or whole by staff-authored biographies. Background On January 27, 2006, The Sun of Lowell, Massachusetts, published an article entitled \\"Rewriting history under the dome\\", which revealed the editing by Congressional staff members of Representative Marty Meehan's Wikipedia entry. Further investigation by Wikipedia editors discovered over a thousand edits by IP addresses allocated to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Wikipedia editors found that most of the edits were considered to be in good faith, but a minority of edits were considered improper. At least one of the addresses involved was prohibited from further editing.Wikipedia editors made a fairly extensive survey of edits from Congressional IP ranges:  Incidents  = Norm Coleman = Later in January 2006, Senator Norm Coleman's chief of staff, Erich Mische, verified that Coleman's staffers had edited his page \\"to correct inaccuracies and delete information.\\" Mische stated: \\"What's to stop someone from writing in that Norm Coleman was 7 feet 10 inches, with green hair and one eye smack dab in the middle of his head? That's about as silly as this gets [...] When you put 'edia' in there, it makes it sound as if this is a benign, objective piece of information.\\" Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said, \\"It appears to be a major rewrite of the article to make it more favorable.\\" = Joe Biden = The Wikipedia investigation found that Biden staffers had removed and modified descriptions of incidents of alleged plagiarism and had recast discussion of a possible Biden 2008 presidential candidacy in a more favorable light. In February 2006, The Washington Post quoted Biden spokesperson Norm Kurz as saying that the changes that were \\"made to Biden's site by this office were designed to make it more fair and accurate.\\" = Gil Gutknecht = On August 16, 2006, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune reported that the office of Representative Gil Gutknecht tried twice‚Äîon July 24 and August 14, 2006‚Äîto remove a 128-word section in the Wikipedia article on him, replacing it with a more flattering 315-word entry from his official congressional biography. Gutknecht's office used the account \\"Gutknecht01\\" for the first edits on July 24, which was then notified of Wikipedia policies against self-editing. For the second set of edits on August 16, his office used an anonymous Congressional IP address.Gutknecht01 Most of the removed text was about the 12-year term limit Gutknecht imposed on himself in 1995, as Gutknecht had run for re-election in 2006. He broke his promise and was subsequently defeated, though not specifically as a result of this pledge. A spokesman for Gutknecht did not dispute that his office tried to change his Wikipedia entry, but questioned the reliability of the encyclopedia. = U.S. Rep. David Davis and Tennessee Rep. Matthew Hill = In August 2007, U.S. Rep. David Davis's press secretary Timothy Hill at first denied‚Äîand later acknowledged, during a second press interview with the Knoxville News Sentinel‚Äîthat he had used a congressional office computer and resources to edit Wikipedia in June 2007. His edits were to delete blocks of information (termed as \\"blanking vandalism\\") about his employer and his brother Tennessee Representative Matthew Hill from their respective Wikipedia biographies.Knoxnews article Entries on Wikipedia edited by Davis aide published August 11, 2007.

Congressional edits The Wikimedia system has responded in at least three ways to questionable edits. The most obvious response is case-by-case, based on the \\"watch\\" button at the top of each article: A user who sets that switch can get emails when that article is changed. Another is an occasional (usually temporary) block. At least some of these are documented in Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits. For edits from IP addresses associated with the U.S. Congress, Ed Summers also created a Twitter feed to notify the world of any changes made from those addresses: @congressedits was an automated Twitter account from 2014 to 2018 that tweeted anonymous changes to Wikipedia articles that originated from IP addresses belonging to the United States Congress. The changes were presumed to have been made by the staffs of US elected representatives and senators. Prior to the Twitter feed, the best information about what congressional staffers were editing was found in the present article on U.S. Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia and in the Wikipedia project page for congressional staffer edits, both of which are manually updated.  Proponents  In August 2014, the Cato Institute suggested that Congressional staffers should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel hosted by the institute endorsed the idea so that congressional staffers could use their time to write neutral and informative articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia and the history of biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the staffers to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.

Weaponlord has players select a character and defeat a series of opponents. The game is a weapons- based fighter, with various gory moves and a deep counterattack system. Project leads James Goddard and Dave Winstead aimed to design a title for enthusiasts of the fighting game genre. Unlike many other fighting games of the time, Weaponlord was designed specifically for home consoles and was one of the first fighting games optimized for online play. It has also been thought of as the basis for Namco's Soul Edge/Calibur series. The game received mixed reviews upon release, with criticism going towards its graphics and animation, while the gameplay was esteemed for its innovation and depth. Many critics remarked that the complexity of the gameplay would make the game too daunting for all but experienced fighting game enthusiasts. Gameplay At its core, Weaponlord is a standard 2D fighting game experience. Where it differs is in its gameplay mechanics, and in some of its aesthetic choices and presentation. The game features thrust-blocking, an aggressive blocking system similar to Street Fighter III's Parry system. Also introduced in the game are Deflect moves, a counterattack maneuver that each character has. Certain special moves, known as \\"Take Downs\\", knock opponents onto their back. A player can then follow up with additional attacks while their foe is still on the floor. In addition, when certain attacks are performed on an opponent in mid-swing, the player can cut off a piece of their clothing or their hair. Players can finish off matches using \\"Death Combos\\" combination attacks that can have a gory effect on opponents. Weaponlord's fighters possess between 9 and 12 special moves each. Moves can be executed one of several ways: sweeping motions on the directional pad followed by an attack button, \\"charge\\" moves where a directional button is held for 2 seconds quickly followed by the opposite direction, and finally an attack button, or hold down moves where the player must first hold down an attack button, followed by a directional motion, and finish it by releasing said attack button. A password is given at the end of a match, so the player can always return to the middle of a game, if need be. A secret password is also given so the Demonlord Zarak is playable in Story Mode. Characters have different ending sequences depending on which opponents were spared, or killed with a Death Combo during the Story Mode. Story On a battlefield a demon spirit enters the body of a dying mercenary. He is reborn and defeats twenty rulers in bloody combat. He goes on to found the reign of the Demonlord Raith. At the height of his power, his doom is foretold by a shaman: \\"When the night turns violent and the moon bleeds, gripped by the skeletal fingers of death...a child will rise to face the demon in combat...and the lord of demons will fall by the hand of...the WeaponLord.\\" Against the advice of his lieutenants to kill the children born that night, the Demonlord waits to face his foretold killer in fair, one-on- one combat. Years later the Demon Zarak overthrows Raith and becomes the new Demonlord. 25 years after the prophecy was made, Zarak holds a great tournament of champion warriors. The winner will face the demon in a final battle. The Demonlord prepares to meet his destiny head on and to destroy the Weaponlord. Development The game's lead designers James Goddard and Dave Winstead had previously worked for Capcom. Goddard was concept creator for Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and designed the character Dee Jay for Super Street Fighter II, and Winstead had worked on Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Both had extensive fighting game tournament experience and wanted to cater to dedicated fans of the genre with Weaponlord. They also wanted to optimize the game for the slow dial-up connections of the XBAND service, timing parry animations and character turnaround time to account for lag. To achieve the creative control they needed to create such a game, they left Capcom to join Namco. There they took over a project led by Ken Lobb codenamed \\"Melee\\", a four-player brawler, and redirected it into the one-on-one fighter they had in mind. The decision to make the game weapons-based stemmed from Goddard's fascination with Conan the Barbarian. The characters and their fighting poses were sketched by Alvin Cardona. Visual Concepts had an incredibly tight schedule to complete the game, and the decision to add a Genesis version came later into the development cycle than most other multi- platform titles. Steve Chiang, the game's co-designer and chief programmer of the SNES version, wrote an in-house tool called \\"Hero\\" which the team used to hand-tune the collision frame by frame. Comic book artist Simon Bisley provided the cover art and the game's logo;Forging WeaponLord - GameSpot, October 8, 2013. Retrieved August 15, 2014. the game was the only title to display the XBAND logo on its box. The development team worked closely with XBAND representatives to ensure that the game would not suffer from lag when being played online. Due to the large size of the character sprites, the team could not include more than seven characters without exceeding space limitations. To compensate for the relatively small character selection, they gave each character an unusually large number of moves. The character sprites were hand drawn pixel-by-pixel on a computer, a common graphics technique which was at the time becoming overshadowed by newer techniques such as polygonal modeling and digitized sprites. The backgrounds were painted by a freelance artist, then scanned into a computer and retouched in Adobe Photoshop. Zarak was the only character in the game to feature his own signature fatality, although rumors persist that other character have unique finishing moves as well. It was originally intended for all of the characters to have a unique death combo but due to the apparent rush to get Weaponlord out the door, only Zarak's was completed. During playtesting, Visual Concepts sent a new version of the game to Namco's testing department at least three times a week. Following the traditional playtest, Goddard and Winstead arranged to have Weaponlord installed in an arcade cabinet in the Golfland in Sunnyvale, California in order to get direct player reactions. Reception Reviewing the Genesis version, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were divided. Two of them panned the game for the choppy animation and poor control, with one concluding that \\"The concepts are there, but the game isn't.\\" The other two also heavily criticized the animation and control, but argued that some gamers would feel that the innovative fighting techniques make the game worthwhile in spite of its flaws. A critic for Next Generation also criticized the choppy animation but greatly praised the innovative and deep weapons combat. He concluded the game to be \\"worthy of at least a good long look.\\" GamePro complimented the graphics, sound effects, and variety of moves. They criticized the limited number of playable characters, but concluded that \\"While the advanced gameplay may scare away beginning barbarians, others will appreciate the deep controls.\\" A different GamePro reviewer made similar remarks of the Super NES version, commenting that the combat system effectively did away with cheap techniques such as corner traps and simple throws, but could be daunting for many players. A Next Generation reviewer remarked that the Super NES version looks better than the Genesis version but suffers from the same choppy animation. Their review again emphasized the depth and innovation of the weapons-based combat. In a retrospective review of the Super NES version, AllGame offered praise for the deep countering system, but said that the complexity of the game may turn off newcomers. Reviewer Scott Alan Marriott said it was not easy to pick up and play like Mortal Kombat and that Weaponlord was \\"designed for the hardcore fan rather than those new to the genre\\" and mentioned that the game's computer opponents were far too difficult for novices. Marriott also wrote that the game's detailed character design was distracting and that the animations were choppy. Despite these flaws, he recommended it as \\"a must-have title for the fighting game enthusiast\\". Weaponlord was not a large commercial success. James Goddard attributed this partly to it being released at the tail end of the 16-bit console era. However, at the time Weaponlord was released, the 16-bit consoles were still dominating game sales.  Canceled sequel  Namco informed the developers that they would not be working on a sequel to Weaponlord. The game's weapon and parry mechanics were shown to Namco; Goddard and Winstead believe that the gameplay became the basis for Soul Edge/Calibur games.

He is best known for directing the semi-documentary 'city symphony' silent film Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis. His audio montage Wochenende (1930) is considered a major contribution in the development of audio plays. Biography Ruttmann was born in Frankfurt am Main; he studied architecture and painting and worked as a graphic designer. His film career began in the early 1920s. His first abstract short films, Lichtspiel: Opus I (1921) and Opus II (1923), were experiments with new forms of film expression, and the influence of these early abstract films can be seen in some of the early work of Oskar Fischinger. Ruttmann and his colleagues of the avant garde movement enriched the language of film as a medium with new formal techniques. In 1926 he worked with Julius Pinschewer on Der Aufsteig, an experimental film advertising the GeSoLei trade fair in D√ºsseldorf. Ruttmann was a prominent exponent of both avant-garde art and music. His early abstractions played at the 1929 Baden-Baden Festival to international acclaim despite their being almost eight years old. Ruttmann licensed a Wax Slicing machine from Oskar Fischinger to create special effects for Lotte Reiniger's 1926 animated fairy tale film The Adventures of Prince Achmed. Together with Erwin Piscator, he worked on the film Melody of the World (1929), though he is best remembered for Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro√üstadt (Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, 1927). During the Nazi period he worked as an assistant to director Leni Riefenstahl on Triumph of the Will (1935). He died in Berlin in 1941 due to an embolism after surgery. Culture and Media Segments from Ruttmann's experimental films Lichtspiel: Opus II (1923) and Lichtspiel: Opus IV (1925) are used in the credits of the German neo-noir television series Babylon Berlin.

Made up of roughly 3,500 employees in six districts and a Division headquarters, the North Atlantic Division is a major subordinate command and serves to integrate the capabilities of its six districts. They plan, design and build for the Army and Air Force in the northeastern states and Europe, develop and manage water resources, and protect and restore the environment. They also work for other international, federal, state and local customers and agencies. Division headquarters are at 302 General Lee Avenue in Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, New York. The division is responsible for six subordinate engineer districts with headquarters in Concord, Massachusetts, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk and Wiesbaden, Germany. Following the American Civil War, rapid increases in civil works construction requirements to support economic growth drove the Army Corps of Engineers to establish many new engineer districts to manage the work. The Corps' national headquarters needed an intermediate level of command and control to manage the districts, so it created several division headquarters including the Northeast Division based in New York City in November 1888. The Corps of Engineers reorganized in 1929 to reduce division headquarters and merged the Eastern Division with the Northeast Division, forming the North Atlantic Division. During World War II while working out of its headquarters at 270 Broadway in Manhattan, the division was responsible for coordinating all military construction in Europe. It also provided staff members and administrative support to the newly created Manhattan District's construction of nuclear bomb, which was code named the Manhattan Project because the district and division's offices being initially co-located. The division commanding general is Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Milhorn, who is directly responsible to the United States Army's Chief of Engineers. Within the authorities delegated, the division commander directs and supervises the individual district commanders. The division commander also serves as the federal representative on the Delaware River Basin Commission, Susquehanna River Basin Commission and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin.

Katok i skripka), is a 1961 featurette directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and from a screenplay written by Andrei Konchalovsky and Andrei Tarkovsky. The film tells the story of the unlikely friendship of Sasha (Igor Fomchenko), a little boy, and Sergey (Vladimir Zamansky), the operator of a steamroller. The film was Tarkovsky's diploma film at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), but was made at the Mosfilm studio. Plot Sasha (Igor Fomchenko) is a boy who lives with his mother (Marina Adzhubei) and his sister in an old house in Moscow. He is learning to play the violin. Every morning he has to cross the yard to go to the music school, trying to avoid some other children who are bullying and harassing him. This day he is lucky as Sergey (Vladimir Zamansky), the operator of a steamroller, tells them to leave Sasha alone. At the music school he plays beautifully, but his teacher, who is more interested in form and order, is stifling his creativity with a metronome. On his way back home Sasha meets Sergey again, who allows him to help him on the steamroller. The two have lunch together and face a number of adventures as they walk around Moscow. They watch a wrecking ball demolishing a decrepit building, revealing one of the Seven Sisters in the background. Sergey tells stories about the war, and Sasha play the violin for his new friend. They part with the plan to see a film together, but the plans are foiled by Sasha's mother. Sasha attempts to sneak out of the apartment, and in the final scene we see Sasha running after the steamroller in a dream like sequence. Production The script for The Steamroller and the Violin was written by Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky, a fellow student of Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK). They worked on the script for more than six months in 1959 and 1960. According to an interview with Polish journalist Zdzislaw Ornatowski, Tarkovsky wanted the film to be a poetic film, based on mood and atmosphere, not on sharp conflicts or traditional dramaturgy. Apart from a couple of minor scenes, two scenes from the first script versions were not included in the final shooting script. First, a scene showing a rehearsal for the May Day parade showing tanks rolling along the street. In the final shooting script this scene is left out in favor of the demolition scene. This scene was intended to reference the war experience of Sergey. The second change involved the final scene of the film. In an earlier variant Sasha waits for Sergey to arrive at work. Sergey ignores Sasha, until Sasha climbs on the steamroller. An alarm clock rings, revealing this to be a dream. For the role of the operator of the steamroller, Sergey, Tarkovsky cast Vladimir Zamansky, an actor at the Sovremennik Theatre. For the role of Sasha he cast Igor Fomchenko, a seven-year-old music school student. Although Tarkovsky was at this time only an unknown film student, he wanted to hire the well-known Sergey Urusevsky as cinematographer. As Urusevsky turned down the offer, Tarkovsky hired Vadim Yusov, who would also be the cameraman for Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood and Andrei Rublev. Although the film was Tarkovsky's diploma film, it was produced at the Mosfilm studio at the production unit for children's films. The film was completed in 1960. For his diploma film, Tarkovsky earned the grade of excellent (), the highest possible distinction.

On June 2, 1944, a German army doctor tries to obtain vital information from an American military intelligence officer by convincing him that it is 1950 and World War II is long over.  Plot  Having attended General Eisenhower's final briefing on the Normandy landings, U.S. Army Major Jeff Pike is sent to Lisbon on June 1, 1944, to meet an informant to confirm that the Nazis still expect the invasion at the Pas de Calais. He is abducted and transported to Germany. Pike wakes up in what looks like a U.S. Army hospital. His hair is graying, and he needs glasses to read. He is told it is May 1950 and he is in post-war Occupied Germany. Psychiatrist Major Walter Gerber explains that Pike has been having episodes of memory loss since he was tortured in Lisbon. He advises Pike that his blocked memories have always resurfaced, helped along by a therapy of remembering events prior to Lisbon and then pushing forward into the blank period. Various props including U.S. Army jeeps and uniforms, baseball, and fake letters, newspaper and radio broadcasts, are used to carefully convince Pike that the year is 1950 and that he is among fellow Americans. He is assisted by a nurse, the dispassionate Anna Hedler. Pike is taken in by the deception. As part of his \\"therapy\\", he recounts the critical details of the invasion plans, including the location and the date, June 5, to his eager listeners. When Pike notices a nearly invisible paper cut he got the day he left for Lisbon, he realizes that he has been deceived. He confirms it by tricking an \\"American\\" soldier into reflexively snapping to attention in the German manner. He confronts Anna, who admits that the date is June 2, 1944. She was recruited from a concentration camp because she was a nurse and spoke English. Pike instructs Anna to tell Gerber that he was onto the plot, while he makes a feeble attempt to escape. Quickly recaptured, he states that he realized what was going soon after waking up due to his paper cut. Gerber does not believe him. After two days of interrogation, however, Pike and Anna convince SS agent Schack, who never believed the deception would work. Schack is sure the invasion will be at the Pas de Calais. Gerber, however, sets the clock forward in Pike and Anna's room so they think it is the morning of June 5, then states that the Germans have been surprised at Normandy. Pike lets his guard down and confirms it. Gerber sends an emergency dispatch, but the weather on June 5 is so bad that Eisenhower postpones the invasion a day (which actually occurred). By midday June 5, Gerber has been discredited and Schack orders his arrest. Gerber knows that Schack will kill them to cover his own blunder when the Allies do finally land at Normandy. Gerber helps Anna and Pike escape, asking Pike to take his groundbreaking research on amnesiacs with him. When the invasion begins the next morning, he laughs at Schack when he arrives, revealing that he has taken poison and pointing out that Schack will likely be liquidated. Schack pursues the escapees on his own, too hurried to wait for troops. The couple flee to a local minister who (Pike knows) had helped downed RAF pilots escape to nearby Switzerland. The minister is away, but his housekeeper Elsa introduces them to a jovially corrupt German border guard, Sgt. Ernst. Pike and Anna bribe him with his watch and her rings to get them across the border. Ernst gives Elsa one of the rings. Schack shows up at the minister's after Ernst and the couple have left for the border - he recognizes Anna's ring on Elsa‚Äôs finger and forces her to reveal where they have gone. Schack catches up at the border, but Ernst shoots him and arranges Schack‚Äôs body to make it look as if he had been killed while trying to escape himself. Safely in Switzerland, Pike and Hedler are put in separate cars. Anna cries as they part, her first display of emotion in years. Cast In addition, James Doohanstill a year away from taking on the role of Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott in the television series Star Trekmakes a brief uncredited appearance as Bishop, clerk to the Colonel MacLean character. Production Most of the film was shot in Yosemite National Park.Stephen Vagg, Rod Taylor: An Aussie in Hollywood (Bear Manor Media, 2010) p. 103 Exterior shots were filmed at the Wawona Hotel near the entrance of Yosemite National Park. Reception =Critical= The New Yorker called the film an \\"ingenious thriller\\" and praised Garner, Saint, and Taylor for being \\"plausible in highly implausible roles.\\"http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1965-06-19 In the opinion of The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther, \\"What is annoying about this picture is that the set-up for pulling off the plot is just too slick and artificial, too patly and elaborately contrived. ... Even though Mr. Seaton has done a thorough and careful job of staging this massive deception and has got his able cast to play it with reasonable assurance, it has such a synthetic look and, indeed, the idea is so theatrical that the whole thing rings curiously false.\\" Garner wrote in his memoirs that he felt \\"the movie doesn't work because there's no suspense; everybody knew than in real life the D-Day invasion was a success and that we'd won the war\\", but he did enjoy working with Saint and George Seaton. Background Banner's role, which provided the comedy relief in 36 Hours, was the role model for his easy-going German soldier, POW camp guard Sgt. Hans Schultz, in the TV series Hogan's Heroes (1965‚Äì71). Coincidentally, Sig Ruman played a similar POW camp guard named Sgt. Schultz in the William Holden feature film Stalag 17 (1953). The film was remade as a 1989 TV movie, Breaking Point, starring Corbin Bernsen.

It is on the Blackwater river at the junction of the N72 national secondary road and the R669 regional road. It is positioned on a sharp 90-degree bend in the river and lies at the foot of the Knockmealdown Mountains. The town is a few miles from Mount Melleray and Lismore, County Waterford. History Evidence of Mesolithic settlement in the area was discovered during an archaeological dig, at nearby Lefanta, during the 1980s. Ancient fortifications in the area include ringforts in the neighbouring Lyre East and Fadduaga townlands, and records of a former medieval castle within Cappoquin Demesne. Dromana House gate lodge Outside the town is Cappoquin House, which was built in the 1770s on the site of an earlier Fitzgerald castle. It overlooks the town, and has formal gardens and landscaped grounds which are open to the public. The 18th century Dromana House, and its elaborate gate lodge, are also located near Cappoquin. Cappoquin Market House, within the town, was built c.1775 as a three bay market house. It is now used as a shop. In September 1849, a number of local members of the Young Ireland movement led an unsuccessful attack against the constabulary barracks in Cappoquin. Economy Within the town's centre, employers include a number of shops and businesses, including a supermarket, pharmacy, post office and credit union. Some of the largest individual local employers are located on the Cappoquin industrial estate, located a half mile into adjoining Lefanta. Being surrounded by fertile fields on all sides, farming and agriculture plays a role in the town, providing employment on the farms and orchards in the area. Near Cappoquin is West Waterford Vineyards, an Irish wine producer. The town has suffered with the decline in the local economy and the loss of both Cappoquin pork and bacon as well as Cappoquin chickens as well as local shops and secondary school. Sport Affane Cappoquin GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Formed in 1969, with the merging of Affane GAA and Cappoquin GAA, the team won its only Waterford Senior Football Championship title in 1974. Affane went on to represent Waterford in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship, losing to Austin Stacks of Kerry. Cappoquin Rowing Club is the town's oldest sporting and social organisation, and was founded in 1862 by James M. Moore and John Stanley. They were assisted by Sir John H. Keane who became the first president of the rowing club, and who had previously captained the Trinity Boat at Cambridge and rowed for Cambridge in 1936 when they defeated Oxford. In the 1880s Cappoquin joined with other rowing clubs nationwide to establish the Irish Amateur Rowing Association. Railway Athletic FC was founded in 1980 and is situated at Danes Field, Cappoquin. Jayson Molumby, who later went on to play with Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. and the Republic of Ireland national football team, formerly played for Railway Athletic FC. Transport =Bus services= Since December 2015 there have been improvements to the frequency of the Local Link (formerly known as D√©ise Link) bus service. There are now four services a day each way Mondays to Saturdays inclusive to Dungarvan including a commuter service. Connections to Waterford and Rosslare Europort can be made at Dungarvan. In the other direction there are four services to and from Tallow via Lismore. Connections for Fermoy can be made at Tallow. On Saturdays, a local bus company operate a service to Cork. On Sundays Bus √âireann route 366 provides one service to Dungarvan and Waterford. This route only operates on Sundays and comprises a single journey in one direction (no return service on any day of the week). =Rail= Cappoquin railway station opened on 12 August 1878, but closed on 27 March 1967. It was located on the now dismantled Waterford to Mallow line and served by the Cork to Rosslare boat train. The construction of the railway bridge below the river bend was to result in tall- masted schooners being no longer able to pass under what was now known as the 'red bridge'. As compensation for this, a new \\"steamers' quay\\" was constructed just down river. The station is still extant.

The lake is located along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm The archaeological record in the area dates back to the Archaic Period, sometime around 3,000 to 5,000 B.C. The Archaic Period people lived along small tributary streams that flow into the Missouri Valley. Later, Woodland Period people (500 B.C. ‚Äì 1,000 A.D.) lived in the area. More recent inhabitants include the Ponca, Yankton Sioux and Omaha tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake- Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/ The Minnesota Santee Sioux arrived on the river shore in the mid-1800s and remain in the area. In 1804, while traveling up the Missouri River on their epic journey to the Pacific Ocean, Lewis and Clark participated in a Grand council with the Yankton Sioux at a site below Calumet Bluff. This significant meeting was the first meeting with a Sioux tribe on their journey upstream.https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm In 1874, the Bon Homme Colony of Hutterites, a branch of the Mennonite movement exiled from Austria, settled on what is now the north shore of Lewis and Clark Lake. They are the first Hutterite Colony in South Dakota and the United States. The colony maintains a traditional communal way of life.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri- River-Dams/Gavins-Point/ The lake was filled in 1957 with the completion of construction of Gavins Point Dam across the river valley. Location The lake is an impoundment of the Missouri River, located approximately upstream of St. Louis, Missouri where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi River. The lake is located within Cedar and Knox Counties in Nebraska and Bon Homme and Yankton Counties in South Dakota. Lake Yankton is located immediately downstream of Gavins Point Dam. The Santee Sioux Reservation is located along the southwestern shore in Knox County. The lake is located approximately west or upstream of Yankton, South Dakota.https://www.visityanktonsd.com/businesses/lewis-clark-recreation-area/ Lewis and Clark Visitor Center The Lewis and Clark Visitor Center is located just south of Gavins Point Dam atop Calumet Bluff with stunning views of Lewis and Clark Lake, Lake Yankton, and the Missouri River below the dam. The visitor center is open daily from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend and open weekdays during other times of the year. The visitor center interprets the history of the Missouri River Basin, including Native Americans, pioneers, the Lewis and Clark Expedition (which traveled through the area); along with local wildlife and the history of the Corps of Engineers in the area. A theater shows educational videos on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, construction of Gavins Point Dam, and the natural history of the Missouri River Region. A bookstore offers educational books, videos, and other merchandise for sale. The visitor center is known for exceptional viewing of the majestic American Bald Eagle, which frequents the Missouri River below the dam, especially in winter months. The visitors center is operated and staffed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Park Rangers, who also give guided tours of Gavins Point Dam and the power plant.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri- River-Dams/Gavins-Point/ Parks and recreation Lake Map identifying Points of Interest and Recreational Areas.

Lewis and Clark Lake is a very popular regional tourist destination in the upper Midwest for camping, water sports, hiking, bird watching, hunting, fishing, swimming, and biking. Average annual public visitation exceeds one- million visitors per year to the lake area.https://corpslakes.erdc.dren.mil/visitors/projects.cfm?Id=G606440 Many of these recreation areas around the lake offer boat ramps, marinas, campgrounds, and day-use areas. The upper stretches of the lake are renowned for their superior waterfowl viewing and hunting opportunities along the Missouri River flyway. Located downstream of the lake is the 59-mile reach of the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR) which stretches eastward from the dam to Ponca State Park, upstream of the lake is the 39-mile reach of the MNRR which stretches westward to Fort Randall Dam. =List of recreation and public use areas= The following are public parks and lake access areas on Lewis and Clark Lake::File:LewisClarkLakeMap.png *Nebraska: **Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area (NE GPC) ***Weigand-Burbach Area & Marina ***South Shore Recreation Area ***Bloomfield Recreation Area ***Miller Creek Recreation Area **Niobrara State Park (NE GPC) **Niobrara Recreation Area (Village of Niobrara) **Calumet Bluff Trail & Overlook (USACE) **Hideaway Acres (Hideaway Acres Assn.) **Santee Recreation Area (USACE & Santee Sioux Nation) **Cottonwood Recreation Area (USACE) **Nebraska Tailwaters Recreation Area (USACE) **Training Dike Recreation Area (USACE) **Deep Water Area (USACE) **Devil's Nest (USACE) **Bazile Creek Wildlife Management Area (NE GPC) *South Dakota: **Lewis & Clark Recreation Area (SD GFP) ***Lewis & Clark Marina and Resort ***Pierson Ranch Recreation Area ***Chief White Crane Recreation Area **Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery and Aquarium (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service) **Tabor Lakeside Use Area (SD GFP) **Charley Creek Lakeside Use Area (SD GFP) **Twin Bridges Lakeside Use Area (SD GFP) **Sand Creek Lakeside Use Area (SD GFP) **Springfield Recreation Area (SD GFP) **Springfield Bottoms Game Production Area (SD GFP) **Running Water Lakeside Use Area (SD GFP) *Key: ** NE GPC = Nebraska Game and Parks Commission ** USACE = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ** SD GFP = South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks Fish, wildlife and natural resources The natural resources and public lands on and around the lake are cooperatively managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, and the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks.

The American Bald Eagle is commonly seen around the dam and lake area, especially in the winter months. Each January the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center hosts \\"Bald Eagle Days\\" a live-bird program that is popular with visitors.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake- Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Gavins-Point/ Species of fish present include walleye, northern pike, sauger, sunfish, yellow perch, common carp, black bullhead, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass.https://outdoornebraska.gov/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/2015FishSamplingReport_LewisAndClarkReservoir.pdf Fishing below Gavins Point Dam is very popular, especially for the annual paddlefish snagging season in October and bowfishing in June. The \\"Fishing Wall\\" immediately below the dam's spillway is popular for fishing year-round as the dam keeps the river free of ice in the winter months. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitor and manage threatened and endangered species on the lake and river. Species of concern include the Pallid sturgeon, least tern, and piping plover. A branch of the Corps known as the Missouri River Recovery Program monitors these species and helps to restore native habitat that was lost as a result of dam construction and channelization of the Missouri River.http://moriverrecovery.usace.army.mil/mrrp/f?p=136:1 The Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery is located just downstream of the lake.https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/fisheries/gavinsPoint.php =Current lake issues= Close-up of a typical shell of a zebra mussel, an unwanted aquatic invasive species was discovered in the lake in 2014. There are several issues impacting recreation, wildlife, and other issues. In 2014 zebra mussels, an aquatic invasive mussel were discovered in the lake and have infested the reservoir and the Missouri River downstream of Gavins Point Dam.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/617615/zebra- mussels-discovered-at-lewis-and-clark-lake/ Lewis and Clark Lake is significantly impacted by sedimentation and siltation issues, diminishing the overall water surface area, water storage capacity, and recreational opportunities. Sediment carried by the Missouri River and Niobrara River is slowed and trapped within the reservoir due to the dam impounding and thus slowing the natural river flow. Studies show approximately 5.1 million tons of sediment are deposited in the lake each year, which contributes to the lake's increasing size of delta area on the western portions of the lake. Approximately 60% of the sediment comes from the Nebraska Sandhills via the Niobrara River. As of 2016, approximately 30% of the lake's overall surface area has diminished due to sedimentation deposits, and some figures project by 2045 approximately 50% of the lake will be diminished due to sedimentation deposits. Presently, there is no plan or solution to remove or slow the progression of the siltation within the lake.http://msaconline.com/ See also *Gavins Point Dam *Lake Yankton *Missouri National Recreational River *Santee Sioux Reservation *List of dams and reservoirs in South Dakota *List of dams and reservoirs in Nebraska *List of dams and reservoirs in United States Further reading *History of Lewis and Clark Lake - U.S. National Park Service External links *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Gavins Point Project & Lewis and Clark Lake (Official site) *Corps Lakes - Lewis and Clark Lake *Recreation.gov - Lewis and Clark Lake *Lewis and Clark State Recreation Area - Nebraska Game and Parks Commission *Lewis and Clark Recreation Area - South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks *Springfield Recreation Area - South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks References Category:Reservoirs in Nebraska Category:Reservoirs in South Dakota Lewis and Clark Category:Bodies of water of Bon Homme County, South Dakota Category:Bodies of water of Cedar County, Nebraska Category:Bodies of water of Knox County, Nebraska Category:Buildings and structures in Knox County, Nebraska Category:Buildings and structures in Cedar County, Nebraska Category:Bodies of water of Yankton County, South Dakota Category:Tourist attractions in Bon Homme County, South Dakota Category:Tourist attractions in Yankton County, South Dakota Category:Tourist attractions in Cedar County, Nebraska Category:Tourist attractions in Knox County, Nebraska Category:Federal lands in Nebraska Category:Water supply infrastructure in Nebraska Category:Lakes of South Dakota Category:Lakes of Nebraska Category:Lewis and Clark Expedition ","title":"Lewis and Clark Lake"},{"id":"3899218","text":"Location of Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands.

Most typewriters in 1972 used fixed-width fonts, and, according to The Washington Post, all of the authenticated documents from the TexANG were typed using fixed-width fonts commonly associated with typewriters. Several experts interviewed by the media suggested that the proportional fonts in the documents indicated likely forgery. John Collins, vice president and chief technology officer at Bitstream Inc., the parent of MyFonts.com, stated that word processors that could produce proportional-sized fonts cost upwards of $20,000 at the time (). Allan Haley, director of words and letters at Agfa Monotype, stated \\"It was highly out of the ordinary for an organization‚Äîeven the Air Force‚Äîto have proportional-spaced fonts for someone to work with.\\" William Flynn, a forensic document specialist with 35 years of experience in police crime labs and private practice, said the CBS documents raise suspicions because of their use of proportional spacing techniques. The Washington Post also indicated the presence of proportional fonts as suspicious because \\"of more than 100 records made available by the 147th Group and the Texas Air National Guard, none used the proportional spacing techniques characteristic of the CBS documents\\". Bill Glennon, a technology consultant in New York City with typewriter repair experience from 1973 to 1985, said experts making the claim that typewriters were incapable of producing the memos \\"are full of crap. They just don't know.\\" He said there were IBM machines capable of producing the spacing, and a customized key ‚Äî the likes of which he said were not unusual ‚Äî for creating the superscript th. Thomas W. Phinney II, program manager for fonts at Adobe Systems, responded to Glennon's statement by saying that the memos could not have been produced with either the IBM Executive or IBM Selectric Composer, which had been suggested as possibilities, due to differences in letter width and spacing. Phinney says that each time a typeface was redeveloped for mechanical technologies with different width factors, the width and designs are altered, which is why even if Press Roman had been intended to look like Times Roman, the result is significantly different. Phinney suggests that the real typist prevented Word from auto-formatting \\"th\\" in superscript by typing and deleting a space in some cases but in other cases did not use the space or left it in the document. Phinney's analysis was based on the fact that the typography of the Killian documents could be closely matched with a modern personal computer and printer using Microsoft Word with the default font (Times New Roman) and other settings. Therefore, the equipment with which the Killian documents were actually produced must have been capable of matching the typographical characteristics produced by this modern technology. As Phinney explained, the letterspacing of the Times New Roman font used by Microsoft Word with a modern personal computer and printer employs a system of 18 units relative to the letter height (em), with common characters being 5 to 17 units wide. (The technology allows even finer variability of character widths, but the 18 unit system was chosen for compatibility with the Linotype phototypesetting and earlier hot-metal versions of the font.) In contrast, the variability of character widths available on early 1970s typewriters using proportional letterspacing was more limited, due to the mechanical technology employed. The most sophisticated of these machines, the IBM Selectric Composer, used a system of 9 units relative to the letter height, in which all characters were 3 to 9 units wide. Less complex machines used fewer widths. Differences in individual character widths accumulate over the length of a line, so that comparatively small differences would become readily apparent. Because of the differing character widths employed, the letterspacing exhibited by the Killian documents (matching that produced by a modern computer and printer) could not have been produced with a mechanical typewriter using proportional letterspacing in the early 1970s. At the time the documents were purportedly created, the matching letterspacing could only have been produced using phototypesetting or hot-metal printing. Since it is not a realistic possibility that Killian would have had these documents printed, Phinney concludes that they are almost certainly modern forgeries. Phinney has long offered $1,000 \\"to anybody who can produce an office-level device that was available in 1972 that can replicate the relative line endings of those memos\\" but no-one has ever tried to do that. Desktop magazine in Australia analysed the documents in its November 2004 issue and concluded that the typeface was a post-1985 version of Times Roman, rather than Times New Roman, both of which are different in detail to IBM Press Roman. = Inter-character spacing = Joseph Newcomer, who helped pioneer electronic typesetting and word processing software, claims that the memos display a simple alternative to kerning characteristic of TrueType fonts but not available on any office equipment in 1972. For example, in words containing \\"fr\\", TrueType moves the \\"r\\" left to tuck it in under the top part of the \\"f\\". The Weekly Standard called Newcomer's explanation the \\"definitive account\\" of why the documents were \\"necessarily forgeries.\\" The Washington Post quoted Newcomer in an article regarding questions about the authenticity of the papers. = Centered headers = Creating centered headers is possible on a typewriter, even if the font is proportional. The typist can left-justify the header and then use the space bar to count the number of spaces from the end of the text to the right margin. In addition, the IBM Executive and Selectric have a kerning key that would give a more accurate measure of the whitespace. Once this number is determined, halving it gives the number of leading spaces for a centered header. The same centering will be achieved on different occasions if the paper is inserted flush to the paper guide, and the same count of spaces is applied. For an example of multiple centered lines produced using a proportionally spaced typewriter font, see the third page of the contemporary annual history of Bush's Alabama guard unit. Word processors, by contrast, center text based on a computer algorithm using a fixed central reference point rather than the left margin on the typewriter as measured from the paper's edge. If the paper in a printer is flush to the left of the paper guide, then a word processor will achieve the same centering throughout a given page and on different pages. The bloggers asserted that it is unlikely that two documents produced 3 months apart by a manual centering process would exactly overlap. In the Killian memos the text matches perfectly when overlaid with a word processor-produced 3 line address block, and between the 3- and 2- line blocks of different memos. = Curved apostrophes = In several places, the documents use apostrophes such as in the words I'm and won't. These are curved somewhat to the left, similar to the shape of a comma. Most typewriters of the era featured vertical apostrophes, rather than angled or curved ones. They were also used for both the opening and closing quotation mark embedded within another quotation instead of the curved forms available in modern day word processors. Compare the straight forms in : The witness testified that \\"Jones yelled, 'Run!' before fleeing the scene\\" in court yesterday. to the curved forms in : The witness testified that ‚ÄúJones yelled, ‚ÄòRun!‚Äô before fleeing the scene‚Äù in court yesterday. The latter requires two separate glyphs for each pair of single and double quotation marks. = Similarity to contemporary documents = The Washington Post reported that \\"of more than 100 records made available by the 147th Group and the Texas Air National Guard, none used the proportional spacing techniques characteristic of the CBS documents.\\" This raises the question of the likelihood of a National Guard office having access to this type of equipment. According to The Washington Post, \\"The analysis shows that half a dozen Killian memos released earlier by the military were written with a standard typewriter using different formatting techniques from those characteristic of computer-generated documents. CBS's Killian memos bear numerous signs that are more consistent with modern-day word-processing programs, particularly Microsoft Word...\\" (September 14, 2004).  Content and formatting  In addition to typography, aspects of the memos such as the content and formatting have been challenged. = Signatures = Of the documents, only the May 4 memo bears a full signature. CBS stated that document examiner Marcel Matley had determined the signature was authentic. However, Matley told the Washington Post on September 14, \\"There's no way that I, as a document expert, can authenticate them\\" because they are copies far removed from the original source. Eugene P. Hussey, a certified forensic document examiner in Washington state, expressed the \\"limited opinion\\" that Killian did not sign or initial the documents. = Skepticism from Killian's family and others = Jerry Killian's wife and son argued that their father never used typewriting equipment and would have written these memos by hand. The family also stated that Killian was not known for keeping personal memos and that he had been very pleased with George W. Bush's performance in his TXANG unit. In contrast, Killian's secretary at the time, Marian Carr Knox, stated, \\"We did discuss Bush's conduct and it was a problem Killian was concerned about. I think he was writing the memos so there would be some record that he was aware of what was going on and what he had done.\\" Although she believed the content of the memos was accurate, she insisted that she did not type the memos CBS had obtained, called them fakes,\\"Memos on Bush Are Fake but Accurate, Typist Says' NY Times ‚Äì September 15, 2004 and noted they contained Army terminology that the Air Guard never used. Earl W. Lively, who at the time was the commanding officer at the Austin TXANG facility was quoted in the Washington Times as saying, \\"They're forged as hell.\\" = Mention of influence by retired officer = Walter Staudt, cited in the memo dated August 18, 1973 as exerting pressure on officers to \\"sugar coat\\" their evaluations of Bush, had in fact retired from the service in March 1972. Staudt also denied being pressured to accept George W. Bush into the National Guard, in an exclusive interview with ABC (\\"Speaking Out,\\" 17 September 2004): \\"'No one called me about taking George (W.) Bush into the Air National Guard,' he said. 'It was my decision. I swore him in. I never heard anything from anybody. And I never pressured anybody about George (W.) Bush because I had no reason to,' Staudt told ABC News in his first interview since the documents were made public.\\" = Mention of Flight Inquiry = It is a matter of record that Lt Bush was suspended from flight status on August 1, 1972 for failure to complete a required annual physical. The Killian memo dated May 4, 1972 is an order to Lt Bush requiring him to report for his physical by May 14, thus making it appear that Lt Bush ignored a direct written order. Lt. Bush's last rating report, dated May 2, 1973, states that Lt Bush \\"cleared\\" the base on May 15, 1972 to head to Alabama. The Killian memo of August 1 called for a flight inquiry board to review Lt Bush's status. However, no records of this request or the flight inquiry board itself have been found. Regulations required such a review following the grounding of any pilot.http://www.glcq.com/regs = Mother's Day = Retired Colonel and former TXANG pilot William Campenni disputed the document dated Thursday May 4, 1972, which ordered Bush to report for a flight physical not later than May 14. According to Campenni, the squadron commander supposedly ordered Bush to report on a weekend when the base was closed. The Ellington Air Guard Base was closed for Mother's Day the weekend of May 13‚Äì14. The next Air Guard drill weekend was May 20‚Äì21. Bush's last day on base was Monday, May 15, 1972, according to the official record.  Peter Tytell's analysis  The CBS review panel led by Dick Thornburgh (a Republican and former U.S. Attorney General) and Louis Boccardi hired Peter Tytell, a leading document examiner, to analyze the four documents: :concluded ... that (i) the relevant portion of the Superscript Exemplar was produced on an Olympia manual typewriter, (ii) the Killian documents were not produced on an Olympia manual typewriter and (iii) the Killian documents were produced on a computer in Times New Roman typestyle [and that] the Killian documents were not produced on a typewriter in the early 1970s and therefore were not authentic.  Mother Jones Kevin Drum of Mother Jones said that believing the documents to be authentic was \\"delusional\\".

It was preceded by Gradius III, released in 1989, although spinoffs had been released prior to it such as Gradius Gaiden. This title brings a considerable graphical upgrade, particularly with the use of colored lighting. In addition, there have been several additions and removals to the vaulted weapons system; specifically, the edit mode has been removed and an online ranking system was added. Gameplay The player's ship, the Vic Viper, exchanging shots with golden dragon enemies in the first stage. The core gameplay of Gradius IV remains relatively unchanged. However, several changes were made on the weapons system in the transition from Gradius III. First of all, the edit mode has been completely eliminated, as are the \\"Snake Option\\" (s.option), the \\"Reduce\\" shield type, and the seventh powerup category. The seventh powerup category was the one that was labeled \\"!\\" and would produce detrimental results, such as reducing the speed or eliminating the weapons of the ship. In this game there are a total of six configurations, the first four of which are migrated from Gradius II. The two new configurations are as follows: *Configuration: The missile mode is a vertical mine that is released above and below the ship. After a short delay, the mines explode, yielding a large explosion. The double mode is the standard 45-degree angle split. The laser mode is a thin armor- piercing round that can penetrate multiple enemies. *Configuration 6: The missile mode is the flying torpedo, which produces two missiles that fly forward in front of the ship. The double mode is the tailgun, seen in other configurations. The laser is the twin laser seen in Gradius III. Development and release Gradius IV was the creation of Konami designers Ashida Hiroyuki, known for his work on Gradius II and Detana!! TwinBee, and Yoro Daisuke, who assisted with production of Bishi Bashi Champion. Daisuke felt that the game was his first \\"important\\" video game project as it was the first video game he was involved in from the start of production, which he claims made development a difficult endeavor. The team often drew their ideas on a whiteboard, which was used as a reference during work. Development was pressured as the team wanted to make a Gradius game worthy of having the name \\"IV\\"; Yoro recalls that the production staff felt indifferent with many of its mechanics, with some having pride in them and others wishing they had been done differently. Ashida joined the project as director, which was met with a somewhat negative reaction from employees working on it. Several stage ideas in Gradius IV were scrapped as the team couldn't decide on how they would work, such as this \\"puzzle stage\\" concept where the player shot reflective spheres to open up passageways. One of the team's biggest ideas was the stage designs, as they wanted them to feel fresh and new, as well as being distinct from previous Gradius titles. The project's theme was \\"interactive\\", signaling that levels should be engaging and react based on the player's movement and actions. As the first game in the series to use 3D graphics, the team focused to make stages take advantage of this. The first stage, featuring large, reflective metal planetoids, was a sort-of homage to Gradius II and its first level, which had fire-coated planets with large dragon-like enemies bursting out of them. Some stage ideas, like the \\"volcano\\" theme in the fourth level, were incorporated from other Gradius games, with the majority being original ideas. A \\"boss rush\\" segment was added as the idea was popular among other Konami staff. Several stage ideas were cut from the final game as the team had disagreements over how they would function, most notably a puzzle-like stage where the player shot reflective spheres to open up passageways. Development of Gradius IV lasted for roughly ten months ‚Äî midway through development it was put on hold while staff was shuffled. The subtitle \\"Fukkatsu\\", translating to \\"Resurrection\\" or \\"Revival\\", was added to represent three different ideas: the revival of Gradius series antagonist GOFER, the revival of arcade games in general, and the revival of more \\"stoic\\" shooting games, as the staff was displeased with how the shooter genre was mainly relegated to bullet-hell, \\"daimaku\\" games for more hardcore fans. The player's ship, the Vic Viper, was redesigned several times as the staff was unhappy with how most of the revisions turned out. The final design was made to emphasize the ship's \\"sharpness\\", since it was redesigned for a 3D video game. The \\"edit mode\\" from Gradius III was cut from IV as the team felt it made the game unbalanced. Gradius IV was presented to the public at the 39th JAMMA tradeshow in Japan in November 1998, shown alongside Konami's own Evil Night. It was officially released in Japan on February 4, 1999, running on the Konami Hornet arcade system. To help promote the game, Konami hosted an online-ranking tournament: once a player's game was over a password was presented, which could be uploaded to the company's website for a chance to win prizes up until August 27, 1999. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Gradius IV on their April 1, 1999 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year. Home versions of Gradius IV were mostly positive. In their review for Gradius III & IV, IGN called its graphics colorful and its backgrounds detailed, although said it was \\"still a bit behind the curve back then\\". Gamers' Republic agreed, going further to say that the PlayStation 2 port was superior than the arcade version through its vibrant backgrounds, fast-paced gameplay and impressive boss fights. Retro Gamer magazine was much more negative towards the game in their 2007 retrospective, saying that its ugly graphics and \\"hideously\\" unfair stage designs made Gradius IV an \\"utter catastrophe of a game\\". They stated the PlayStation 2 conversion was slightly improved thanks to its save-state feature, but that overall it was a major disappointment compared to previous Gradius game. In a 2017 retrospective coverage of the Gradius series, Hardcore Gaming 101 said that IV felt more like a \\"best-of\\" remake of the first four games instead of a full-new game, disliking its graphics for being poor and its mechanics for sometimes being unfinished and not well-implemented. They also said that the game was more of a step back compared to the critically acclaimed Gradius Gaiden for not using many of its ideas and features that proved to fix and improve upon the core Gradius gameplay, writing: \\"Since it feels like such a redux, with very little added to the formula and almost nothing carried over from Gaiden, Gradius IV just seems redundant. It‚Äôs not terrible, but it‚Äôs really only worth investigating for hardcore fans and completionists.\\" Notes References External links * Category:1999 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Gradius video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Gradius IV"},{"id":"3899275","text":"Kathy Butterly is an American sculptor born in Amityville, New York in 1963.

Order of battle The Swedish fleet at Svensksund consisted of one light, shallow draft, frigate, six , one , three , and one archipelago frigate, with twenty gun sloops, four mortar longboats, four cannon longboats and five galleys. The fleet had 5,000 men plus those aboard auxiliaries and transports. Swedish strength was dispersed defending the whole length of the coastline. The Swedish open sea fleet failed to defeat the Russian fleet at √ñland and was unable to clear Russian ships from the Porkkala region. The Russian coastal fleet consisted of a frigate, eight xebecs, five brigs, three bomb vessels, eighteen galleys, twenty-nine half-galleys, twelve gun sloops and three cutters with a total of 12000 men plus those aboard auxiliaries. The Russian coastal fleet was supported by a squadron of three frigates, seven xebecs, and two dozen smaller ships from the open sea fleet commanded by Ivan Balle. First phase of the battle First battle of Svensksund The Swedish fleet prepared for Russian numerical superiority by creating blockades of scuttled ships in the narrow passages on 23 August. Failure to blockade all the narrow passages made this operation unsuccessful. Action between main elements of the Swedish archipelago fleet and the Russian squadron led by Balle started at 10:00 on 24 August and the artillery duel continued for six hours before the initial Russian attack from the south was beaten back with Russians losing three ships captured and several others badly damaged. Second phase of the battle The Russian coastal fleet had meanwhile approached from the east and was probing its way through the Swedish blockade under fire. Advantage shifted from the defenders to the attackers at 16:00 when the right wing of the Russian coastal fleet led by Giolio Litta penetrated the unblockaded narrow passage between Majasaari (Koiromsari) and Tiutine. The Russian attack forced Swedish ships guarding the blockade to withdraw allowing the Russians to clear remaining blockade obstacles. Russians captured the turuma S√§llan V√§rre which had run aground while defending the blockades and Enrique MacDonell's hemmema Oden which had come to its aid. The Swedish archipelago fleet withdrew into the safety of fortress at Svartholm when it became clear that Russians had beaten the blockade. Several other ships were lost during the withdrawal. The turuma Bj√∂rn J√§rnsida, which had been Ehrensv√§rd's flagship at the start of the battle, ran aground and struck its colors after bravely fighting nearly to the last man. The frigate af Trolle, turuma Ragvald, and a gun sloop were also captured. Swedish auxiliaries and transport vessels trapped north of island of Kotka were burned to prevent their capture. Aftermath Total Swedish losses were three turuma archipelago frigates, one hemmema archipelago frigate, one light frigate, one galley, one half-galley, one schooner, nine gun sloops and thirty transport and auxiliary vessels. Roughly 1500 Swedes were killed, wounded or captured during the battle. A field hospital was formed for another 500 sick Swedes unable to evacuate. Russian losses were one galley and one gun sloop blown up. Russians recaptured all ships from Balle's squadron captured by Swedes early in the battle. Their casualties were 383 men killed, 628 injured and 22 captured.–í. –î. –î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–æ. –ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ –±–∏—Ç–≤—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. –°–ü–±, 2002, c. 67 Russians gained a clear victory but failed to inflict decisive defeat on the Swedish archipelago fleet. A delayed attack by Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen allowed Swedes to defeat Ivan Balle's squadron. Early defeat of Balle's squadron allowed most of the Swedish fleet to reach the safety of Svartholm fortress and regroup for later battles. Navigation of the shallow yet unobstructed narrow between Tiutine and Koiromsari by Giulio Litta's small galley force was the crucial factor in Russian success at Svensksund. Several factors contributed to the Swedish defeat. A successful Russian blockade at Porkkala prevented two archipelago frigates, roughly twenty galleys, and several gun sloops and yawls from reaching Svensksund in August 1789. Ehrensv√§rd's preparations for defense were hampered by King Gustav III's opposition to his plan. Ehrensv√§rd's decision not to blockade the narrow between Tiutine and Koiromsari due to his belief that it was too shallow to navigate was a crucial error; and delayed construction of obstacles in the straits opening towards Frederikshamn made it possible for the Russians to clear them quickly. Inadequate sounding of the Swede's selected battleground caused several Swedish ships to run aground during the battle. The Swedes might have been victorious at Svensksund in 1789 had the king allowed Ehrensv√§rd to withdraw to Svartholm after defeating Balle's squadron as Ehrensv√§rd had planned. King Gustav III was aware his fleet was running low on ammunition when he gave the order to fight against the main force of the Russian coastal fleet.

It takes place near the city of Samara, on the Mastryukovo lakes. The festival takes its name from Valeri Grushin, a singer-songwriter who died during a backcountry camping trip trying to save his drowning friends. During Soviet times, the formal oversight of the festival was performed by VLKSM. Usual participants included Yuri Vizbor, Tatyana and Sergey Nikitins, Bulat Okudzhava, Alexander Dolsky, Oleg Mitayev, among others. Singer Alexander Gorodnitsky was festival's long-term director. The major landmark of the festival is the stage built on the raft, in the shape of a guitar, with its fingerboard serving as a bridge to the shore. The Grushin Mountain ridge serves as natural stands for thousands of visitors. The number of visitors, as well as of participants, increased every year, starting from only 600 in 1968 to 2,500 next year, and the peak of Soviet era Grushinsky was reached in 1979 - 100,000 spectators. This record was broken in modern times: 1997 festival attracted 140,000 spectators. Similarly, the number of artists in 1969 was 20, and in 1976 it grew up to 143. In 1980 the fest was cancelled and was resumed only in 1986. Since then it has become a regular annual event. In the late 1990s, the festival became commercialized, and broadened its format larger than only bard songs. Some Russian rockers, such as Yuri Shevchuk of DDT, now perform there as well. Since 2007 Grushinsky has split into two rival festivals of the same name. The main promoter of the fest, the Grushin Club, has moved to a venue near Tolyatti. The festival at Mastryukovo lakes is still held without their promotion.

The result is typically cleavage at non-canonical recognition sites, or sometimes complete loss of specificity. Differences which can lead to star include low ionic strength, high pH, and high (> 5% v/v) glycerol concentrations. The latter condition is of particular practical interest, since commercial restriction enzymes are usually supplied in a buffer containing a substantial amount of glycerol (50% v/v is typical), meaning insufficient dilution of the enzyme solution can cause star activity; this problem most often arises during double or multiple digests. Star activity can happen because of presence of Mg2+, as is seen in HindIII, for example. The term star activity was introduced by Mayer who characterized the modified activity in EcoRI.

Early life Uhlmann was born on August 16, 1919 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended the College of Engineering, University of Michigan, from 1937 until 1940. In September 1940, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as an apprentice seaman and, during November and December, trained in . Following his appointment as a midshipman in the Naval Reserve on March 17, 1941, he trained at the Midshipman School, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, and on June 12, 1941 was commissioned ensign. After additional training, he reported to Patrol Squadron 24 on August 1, 1941. This squadron, a part of Patrol Wing 2 stationed at Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, was redesignated Patrol Squadron 12 (VP-12) in October 1941. Pearl Harbor attack On the morning of December 7, 1941, as the incredulous commander of Patrol Wing 1 investigated reports that a plane of the dawn patrol had depth- charged a Japanese submarine only a mile from the entrance of Pearl Harbor, nine Japanese fighters circled low over the airfield at Kaneohe and then attacked, machine-gunning the control tower and leaving planes in flames in the bay and on the ramp. The men of VP-12 sprang into action without regard for personal safety, exposing themselves to the deadly fire of the enemy planes as they sought to save planes not yet destroyed and to fight off the raiders. The Japanese fighters strafed automobiles trying to reach the field and concentrated attention on men attempting to man guns in the grounded planes. Everyone on station joined the duty sections in combatting the surprise attackers. While across the island in Pearl Harbor the Pacific Fleet fought for survival, Fleet Air Detachment, Naval Air Station, Kaneohe, waged its own battle against the Japanese attackers with only rifles and machine guns. A short time later, a second wave of enemy planes flew over, bombing vulnerable hangars and planes, and destroying the hangar where many members of Patrol Squadron 12 were obtaining replenishment ammunition for machine guns. Additional strafing attacks followed; and, before the morning was over, eight patrol bomber seaplanes were destroyed, and all 35 planes which had been on the ground when the attack began were out of commission. Air station personnel shot down two Japanese planes and scored hits on the fuel tanks of seven others, but the material and human costs were high. Among the dead at the end of the battle was Ensign Uhlmann who had joined with VP-12 in the courageous attempt to repulse the enemy. Namesake In 1943, the destroyer was named in his honor.

This system is practiced in several countries, notably Germany, Austria, Switzerland and in the German- speaking Community of Belgium, but also for some years now in South Korea. In the Duales Ausbildungssystem, students can learn one of 356 (as of 2005) apprenticeship occupations (Ausbildungsberufe), such as Doctor's Assistant, Dispensing Optician or Oven Builder. The precise skills and theory taught are strictly regulated and defined by national standards: An Industriekaufmann (Industrial Manager) has always acquired the same skills and taken the same courses in production planning, accounting and controlling, marketing, HR management, trade laws, etc. Especially in southern Germany this model is also used for a special college system called Duale Hochschule. In France, dual education (formation en alternance) has gained a lot of popularity since the 1990s, with information technology being the greatest draw. In South Korea, the German and Swiss dual apprenticeship system was studied and implemented by then President Park Geun-hye to address South Korea's more glaring employment needs including tackling the country's high youth employment rate and as well as reforming South Korea's entire education system. Since the rise of Meister schools and modern reforms through the implementation of vocational education in the South Korean education system, graduates from vocational high schools have been successful in navigating through South Korea's highly competitive and sluggish job market as they possess relevant skill sets that are in high demand in the South Korean economy. History of dual education in Germany In Germany, the dual education system formally emerged after the passage of the Vocational Training Act of 1969. A description of its functioning and value is given in Pritchard (1992),58\\\\. PRITCHARD, R.M.O. (1992) \\"The German Dual System: Educational Utopia?\\" Comparative Education, Vol. 28, No. 2: 131-143 It was significantly enhanced by reforms in 2005. Historically, vocational training was organized by the various guilds through apprenticeships, as their members sought to ensure that they had a talented labor pool to perpetuate their respective industries. The Vocational Training Act codified and standardized this system across Germany, serving as the foundation upon which the state, the private sector, and trade unions could effectively coordinate to deliver the dual system for a modern Germany. This high level of coordination allowed for the development of public education programs and firm specific apprenticeships that are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Apprenticeship section As one part of the dual education course, students are trained in a company for three to five days a week. The company is responsible for ensuring that students get the standard quantity and quality of training set down in the training descriptions for each trade. In Germany, this practical training may be complemented by more practical lessons at workshops run by the guilds and chamber of commerce, in order to compensate for the bias caused by training at only one company. These extra courses usually take three or four weeks a year. The time spent at vocational school is approximately 60 days a year, in blocks of one or two weeks at a time spread out over the year. In France, the same amount of time is spent in practical training and theory, with the following possible systems: *2.5 days in a company, 2.5 days at school, *one week in a company, one week at school, *six months in a company, six months at school. French companies must provide a tutor or other person responsible for the students, or a human resources officer to deal with them. Their duties may involve daily tutoring and/or targeted training. French apprentices on the dual education course are paid a certain percentage of the minimum wage for the job they are learning. School section The other part of the dual education course involves lessons at a vocational school (German: Berufsschule). The responsibility for this part of the course lies with the school authorities in every German state or Swiss canton. Both general lessons (for example German, politics, economics, religion or even sport) and trade-specific theory are taught. Lessons may be taught part-time (one or two days a week) or in blocks of several weeks. The latter is preferred for trades learned by only a small number of students, where students may have to travel long distances to get to the nearest vocational school which teaches their subject. Testing In Germany, for most trades, the first examination takes place about half-way through the vocational training and is only to test how well the student is doing so far: the marks do not go towards the final exam. Both exams are organised by the small business trade group and chamber of commerce and industry. Examinations for trained artisans are traditionally known as journeyman's tests (Gesellenpr√ºfung). Examinations for trades which have been recognised more recently are organised slightly differently. Here, the first examination counts as 40% of the total result, with the final examination making up the other 60%. Those who fail the exam can apply to have their training extended until the following year when they can retake it. Only one extension is allowed. Advantages The student is an employee of the company from the beginning and receives tasks that are according to his growing abilities. If a company is willing to make an employment-contract with the student after his dual education time, the company gets an employee who knows the company's workflow. The student can also benefit from the knowledge about born hard and soft skills of more experienced co-workers. The student develops under real conditions. Therefore, he can see if he is not able or willing to do this job quite early and not only after exams. Furthermore, the student earns money from the beginning. Given that students in dual education systems receive high quality vocational training and education, they are well prepared to enter the job market at a young age, and the firms that participate in their training are more willing to hire them when they graduate. As a consequence, Germany has the lowest rate of youth unemployment in the European Union, and Austria has similarly low rates. Furthermore, the system effectively provides huge savings for firms on recruitment costs, as they are aware of and invested in the skills of potential hires. It is also seen as a contributor to the economic success of Germany's world renowned firms, as the highly skilled workforce can contribute directly to improvements in production and service delivery. Disadvantages Although the dual education system is generally considered to be exemplary, more young people are taking vocational education and training courses at training sites and schools rather than in real companies, as they are becoming less willing to take on apprentices for various reasons. The Cabinet of Germany considered making it compulsory for firms to take on apprentices. The idea was dropped when the trade associations agreed to a voluntary training pact. Companies that take on apprentices have to follow many regulations, and the training itself is very expensive. Requirements for several positions have become more complex and many high school graduates do not provide the right level of education. The less complex positions have only graduates with very little education are willing to do it, and even they are not able to keep up with the course. Also, companies are often highly specialised and unable to train apprentices in all the required areas. Two solutions put forward so far are \\"contractual education\\" (Auftragsausbildung) and state-run courses. The former would involve companies training apprentices that they do not plan to employ; the contract would also not be an employment contract. The latter would involve training outside companies: in schools and colleges. Switzerland also has more and more young people finding it hard to get a place in a company of their choice. In 2004, a conference took place and was attended by all the parties in the Swiss Federal Council; as no agreement could be reached on which measures to take, the only result was a call for all companies to take on apprentices. The lack of places has changed the conditions in which apprentices are taken on. In 2004, one new company even advertised apprenticeships in information technology in which apprentices had to pay for the training themselves. The uproar was so great, however, that the company was not able to start up. Today, most apprentices have to take aptitude tests before they are accepted, and the company can usually chose from several candidates.  Difficulties in Exporting Dual Education  Although the dual education system seems promising at partnering future employees with potential jobs in their industry, it does not mean every country can simply create a dual education system within their borders. The system is successful in Germany because VET (the model for dual education) is regulated and strongly funded by both the federal government and German states and works closely with the German industry for maximum success. The model is unlikely to easily be adapted in other countries for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the high degree of success can be attributed to Germany's long- historical culture of apprenticeships. This system was grown in Germany over a period of time under very specific conditions and cannot easily be adapted in other modernized countries. One important degree of the dual education system is the high standard of education provided by the German government in Germany. This allows apprentices to not only specialize early on but maintain the basic education needed to react flexibly in the future. Another important aspect is that in other developed or developing countries, large social problems exist which prevent the creation or minimize the effectiveness of a potential dual education system. High-college costs and economic inequality mean that the local government must provide even more for certain individuals to succeed for the system to work. Finally, the long culture of apprenticeship makes sense in Germany but produces social stigmas in other foreign nations as it is seen as inferior as opposed to the traditional educational pathway.  Present Day Dual Education  Today's system of dual education in Germany functions by cooperation between small and medium companies. Cooperation is regulated by law and employers and trade unions are responsible for creating new training regulations. Since certificates and standardized across all industries, the dual education system ensures that apprentices receive the same training regardless of region or company. Employers trust the certificates since they provide evidence of an individual's knowledge. There is also a shared responsibility between the government, employers and trade unions which helps in responding to digital landscapes or changing job markets which impact how effective future employees may be in the future job market. Dual education was designed to make it easier for employers seeking new employees by allowing them to test potential candidates as apprentices and create a smoother flow for the hiring process. Good schools are a critical factor to this system as they better prepare candidates for changing job conditions. The dual education system is not perfect and flaws do exist. Although, creating specialization through early vocational training and apprenticeships programs can have its advantages, disadvantages also exist. As change accelerates in many industries, the skills of an individual apprentice become obsolete faster. Apprentices can excel early on in the job market but a lack of general skills and lifetime learning in new jobs cause them to do worse later on. Nonetheless, the dual education system is still very effective in stifling unemployment especially among the youth. Future of the dual education system The modern era of rapid economic and technological change has expanded the role of the dual education system in the labor force. Increasingly, older workers are making use of the system to gain new skills in the ever-evolving labor market. This is known as Continuous Vocational Educational Training, or CVET. Given the robustness of the systems in Germany, Austria, and other similar countries, dual education may help these countries adapt more quickly to ongoing economic transformation.

One of the earliest members of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), it is a public school in the British sense of the term. Founded on 25 May 1563 by royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I, the school is one of the oldest public schools in the British Isles, and the oldest public school in the Channel Islands. The school endured a difficult two and a half centuries after its foundation, with a number of principals being either dismissed or resigning following disputes with the local authorities. In response, the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, Sir John Colborne, established a committee to perform a full review of the school. It was subsequently re-chartered in 1824 with new staff and an improved curriculum to attract fee-paying pupils from England. Its current main building was completed in 1829, on the same grounds as the original school, overlooking the town and harbour of Saint Peter Port. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the school was evacuated to Great Hucklow, Derbyshire, where it operated for five years. Having been a boarding school since its foundation, the gradual decline in the number of children being sent to the island to board meant the school became a day school in 1996 when the boarding houses converted into what would become the junior school. In January 2020, the school announced that girls will be admitted to the upper school from September 2021 as part of plans to become fully coeducational by 2025. The upper school has about 500 boys aged 11 to 18, and provides a coeducational sixth form in partnership with The Ladies' College. There is an associated coeducational junior school for ages 2¬Ω to 11 at the nearby Acorn House in King's Road (pre-school) and Beechwood (primary) in Queen's Road. As a selective school, prospective pupils must pass an entrance exam to be offered a place, although the school accepts pupils from a wide ability range. The school charges ¬£4,260 per term, with three terms per academic year, as of 2020/2021. Value-added statistics place Elizabeth College in the top 17% of British schools. The alumni of the school are known as Old Elizabethans and, since 1824, pupils have each been allocated a unique, sequential school number. Among these alumni are an Olympic gold medallist, several Bailiffs of Guernsey as well as a number of notable persons in various fields including the arts, sports and academia. Noted for producing students who would later join military colleges in the United Kingdom, the school has also produced four Victoria Cross recipients. The school has also been very successful in rifle shooting, and several alumni have gone on to compete at international level. History =Foundation= Prior to the school's foundation, the Queen's Commissioners identified and uncovered a number of outrages and frauds which raised concern over the civil and religious administration of Guernsey. The social deprivations apparent on the island throughout the 1500s were summarised by the 1824 enquiry into the 'State and Condition of Elizabeth College', which described how 'the island ... appears to have been most deplorable, for ignorance, superstition, and, especially, for the unsettled state of its political and religious affairs', noting also that 'in the year of the institution of the College, three persons were burned for witchcraft' and 'the whole island was in a state of dissension and confusion'. St James assembly hall to the right, c. 1860 By 1563, the Privy Council felt that intervention was needed to reform the island. They recommended that the island's 'spiritual and temporal jurisdictions [be examined] to reform errors and abuses', alongside which they recommended the establishment of a school by Royal Charter. Elizabeth I and her ministers believed the island required education at secondary level, so that students might go on to preach as clergymen in Guernsey churches in line with principles of the Protestant reformation. The Charter required the States of Guernsey to found a free grammar school with a schoolmaster appointed by the Governor of Guernsey. The school was officially founded on 25 May 1563 on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I, by a patent roll issued by the Crown which read: > Also since there is no grammar school in the isle, to erect a free grammar > school there called Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School under the seal of the > isle; the schoolmaster thereof to be appointed and removable by the Captain > (except the Queen shall otherwise order); the school to be endowed with > wheat rentes of 80 quarters a year found to belong to the Queen by the late > Commissioners. The school was instituted in September that year, and was the fourth school to be established on the island; the others being the Saint Peter Port, Saint Peter's and Saint Martin's schools. In order to create a site for the school, Franciscan friars were moved from their lands on La Rue Des Fr√®res, a site which the school still occupies. The school's lands extended from College Street through the Grange all the way to Upland Road. Originally, the main school buildings were on the part of the site which now houses the Science department, the oldest remaining building being the cottage on the corner of the current campus, near the top of Smith Street (La Rue des Forges). The first schoolmaster was distinguished Belgian scholar Adrian Saravia, who went on to become a translator of the King James Bible. Saravia had left the island by 1571, describing the local population as an 'uncivilised race' which 'hates all learning'. =Reform and reconstruction= It took a further two and a half centuries before the school had proper buildings and sufficient staff, a period during which the pupil roll never exceeded 29. Many principals came and went, but were incompetent and uncommitted; either dismissed or resigned following disputes with the local authorities. In 1824, due to increased demand for a higher standard of local education and a properly-run College, the Lieutenant-Governor of the island, Sir John Colborne, established a committee to perform a full review of the school. The school was re-chartered in 1824; by 1826 there were new staff and an improved curriculum, and the school was in a position to attract fee-paying pupils from England. On 19 October 1826 the foundation stone of a new building was laid by Colborne, and the school was renamed the Royal College of Elizabeth. At the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone, Colborne made the following speech: > With this part of the ceremony it is gratifying to reflect that the > assemblage attracted here evinces the intense interest excited generally > through the Island by the efforts of the States to renovate Elizabeth > College. Laying the foundation stone, although a mere form, is in this > instance so closely associated with the use of the intended superstructure, > and with the prospect of it being greatly influential in bringing the > institution into maturity, that we participate with delight in these > ceremonies, and in perfect confidence that our hopes will be realised, we > may venture to assert that as the approach to liberal instruction is > facilitated, so will the prosperity of the island increase. A great stimulus > to education has been already given by the deliberation and conduct of the > States; they have armed the directors with sufficient power to carry their > intentions into execution, and these guardians of the College and of the > parochial and central schools, cannot fail in their office, for they will > recollect, from what has occurred, that the tree which bears fruit thinly > must be invigorated, and be encircled with fresh mould. [...] We trust that > these excavations completed with so much perseverance and success, are > emblematical of the industry and steady course that will be pursued by our > young friends and by every member of College Elizabeth. John Wilson The reform of the school also saw the introduction of the first official register of pupils, from which each pupil was allocated a unique, sequential school number. The first pupil to receive a number was Sir John Colborne's son, James, later Baron Seaton,Elizabeth College Register 1824‚Äì1873 published by Frederick Clarke 1898 followed by his other son, Francis. Many Old Elizabethans remain fond of their numbers, often using them on car number plates in the island. After the re-chartering of the school in 1824, the Rev. Dr Charles Stocker was appointed principal, and developed a reputation for 'unmerciful' flogging while applying himself to raise the academic standing of the school, as well as concentrating on the construction of the new main building. In the school's first year since the re-chartering, there were more than 100 boys on the school roll, however over the next couple of years the number of new entrants decreased as low as 17 in 1827. In 1829, three years after the laying of the foundation stone, the new building was ready to be occupied by students and staff. The building, which remains a prominent feature on the skyline of St Peter Port, was designed by John Wilson, who was also the architect of the Meat Market, Castle Carey and the former Church of St James. Upper Canada College, in Toronto, Ontario, was founded in 1829 by Sir John Colborne, based on his experience with the school. In the 1850s, a new form of punishment was introduced whereby the window recesses in the upper gallery of the school were converted into 'lock-ups' in which students would be held for short confinement during school hours. The wood-panelled walls of the cells were covered with carvings from those who had been held there. A popular ghost story from the lock-ups was that of 'Wilson', who was supposedly locked up and forgotten about for such a long time that he died of starvation. Armand de Quatrefages, c. 1860 The school significantly expanded both its teaching and extra-curricular facilities in the latter half of the 19th century, building a gymnasium on the school site and purchasing fields in Kings Road for a cricket ground which was completed and named the College Field in 1888. The old school building was converted into a science laboratory, named after Edward Ozanne, in order to centralise scientific instruction for the whole island. Some of the biggest developments came under the leadership of the Rev. William Penney, appointed in 1888, who identified many faults with the quality of teaching, as well as attending to the building which was badly in need of repair. He revised the entire syllabus, introduced masters' meetings to be held twice a term as well as reports sent to parents every half term. Penney revised the punishment system too, only allowing himself and the Vice-Principal to use the cane. Penney oversaw the reincarnation of The Elizabethan magazine, as well as the formation of the Old Elizabethan Association, which set about wiping the school's debts by 1898 through a variety of money-raising ventures. = World war period = Throughout the rest of the 1800s, the school gained a reputation for catering for the sons of British government officials employed across the British Empire, many of whom followed distinguished colonial careers in their own right. In this era, the school was noted for producing students who would later join military colleges in the United Kingdom. All told, 662 Old Elizabethans served in World War I, 105 of which were known to have been killed and many more died of injuries sustained in battle, meaning approximately one in five of all the boys who had joined the school since the re-chartering had served in the Great War. A roll of honour was erected in the main hall to commemorate those who fought and died in the war. Four alumni have been awarded the Victoria Cross: The first in 1857 to Duncan Home, followed in 1881 by John McCrea, then Lewis Halliday in 1900 and Wallace Le Patourel in 1943. The four houses at the junior school were later named in their memory. In 1900, Lewis Halliday became the third recipient of the Victoria Cross from the school. In 1939, the school remained largely unaffected by the transition from peace to the Phoney War, with many believing the Channel Islands to be the safest place in the British Isles. Precautionary measures were taken nonetheless; air-raid shelters were dug in front of the school's main building, and black-out regulations required some school activities and societies to be curtailed. The air-raid shelter was later converted by German forces into a secure holding area for weapons and ammunition. Following developments in the war in May 1940, all the senior boys were required to join the Local Defence Volunteers and came to school with rifles slung across their shoulders. Many school activities continued uninterrupted at this point, with cricket and swimming continuing in the unusually fine weather. In June however, the extent of the dangers of war began to be realised. French resistance collapsed, after which the island's Army and RAF units left the island. Fearing the imminent occupation of the Channel Islands by German forces, an evacuation scheme was quickly assembled by the school Governors with Jersey and the Home Office, and on the evening of Thursday 20 June the school was evacuated to Great Hucklow, Derbyshire, where it would spend five years 'in exile', during which pupils had little or no contact with their parents. At the start of the occupation, the school buildings were home to the States Controlling Committee, but in 1941 the German authorities demanded the use of the school buildings as headquarters and offices. A strongroom bunker was built inside what is now the AJ Perrot room, which remains to this day, albeit without the door. Despite the shortages in staff, facilities and money, there were still a number of scholastic successes over this period, with eight pupils receiving scholarships to the University of Oxford. The official liberation announcement by Brigadier Alfred Ernest Snow was made from the steps of the school in 1945 to a crowd of cheering locals, although it was not until August that the boys were able to return home to continue their education at College. German prisoners of war were tasked with cleaning up and repairing the damage to the building, which was not as bad as had been feared initially. =Modern period= The gatehouse was rendered obsolete during WWII, and so a new entrance was built slightly further up the Grange. Once the school began accepting pupils again after the war, numbers increased at such a rate that for the first time since 1829, the main building was too small to accommodate the students. Rapid development followed, including the purchase of Beechwood, a former nursing home, in 1948 which was converted into a boarding house. A squash court was added, and the nearby Grange Club was purchased in 1950 and converted into a library; land was acquired at Footes Lane for a cricket field, and a new science block built. The 1990s saw the refurbishment of the science laboratories, improved facilities for sport and physical education, and the development of a purpose-built art department. Having been a boarding school since its re-chartering in 1824, the end of the 20th century saw a gradual decline in the number of children being sent to the island to board, not helped by the increasingly high fares on air and sea routes from the mainland. There was also a growing requirement for independent infant schooling in Guernsey, and so the King's Road boarding house was reopened in October 1996 as Acorn House pre-school and pre-prep. In 1992, the school accepted a group of girls into the sixth form from the relocating Blanchelande College. They were the first girls to be officially registered and receive college numbers, and provoked the first discussions about the possibility for a mixed-sex sixth form run in co-operation with the Ladies' College sixth form. David Toze's appointment as principal saw a large number of changes implemented at the school. He appointed the first-ever female headteacher of Beechwood in 2000, and oversaw the merging of Acorn House and Beechwood into the Elizabeth College Junior School, as well as driving forward the link between the Ladies' and Elizabeth College sixth forms. Dr Nick Argent, appointed in 2001, oversaw the development of the sixth form centre in the basement of the main building in 2008. Having appointed its first-ever female principal, Jenny Palmer, in 2017, in January 2020 the school announced that \\"in recognition of the needs of contemporary society\\", girls will be admitted to the upper school into Year 7 and into the sixth form from September 2021 as part of plans for the school to be entirely coeducational by 2025.  Governance  Governance is delivered by a board of nine governors who serve for a six-year term, with the exception of the Dean of Guernsey, who acts as chairman. In addition to the Dean, two governors are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor and six are elected by the States of Guernsey. Several of the directors are former pupils of the school and parents of current pupils. Three committees meet regularly: foundation and marketing, finance and general purposes, and a junior school committee. The school's directors are required to meet the safeguarding standards applicable in the UK, while also meeting the slightly different safeguarding legislation existing in Guernsey. The school is also a member of the Three Colleges Group, along with the Ladies' College and Blanchelande, and a sixth form partnership group with the Ladies' College to ensure unity between Guernsey's three independent schools. The school has charitable status in both the UK and Guernsey. In 2007 the school established The Elizabeth College Foundation (Guernsey registered charity CH91) and The Elizabeth College UK Foundation (a UK registered charity 1120954). While the school has been independent for most of its history, States of Guernsey statutes concerning funding toward Elizabeth College date back as far as 1826 and grant funding has been in place since 1965.  Admissions  The school admits boys between the ages of 11 to 18, though typical ages for admission into the upper school are 11 and 16. The school is selective, meaning prospective pupils must pass an entrance exam in order to be offered a place. Candidates for entry at age 11 sit an entrance assessment in November prior to entry in the following September which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning, while entry into the sixth form at 16 is based upon GCSE results. Initial admission to the junior school is by interview, entry to Years 1 and 2 is by informal assessment, and from Year 3 by formal measures of standardised assessment. Along with Ladies' College and Blanchelande, the school accepts pupils with a wide ability range, revealing in 2017 that only three pupils in total had been denied entry to all three Colleges in the last two years out of the 375 pupils that sat entrance assessments. At the primary school, the average ability of pupils is above the national average in the United Kingdom. The results of standardised tests indicated that the average ability of the pupils in the senior school is well above the national average of pupils in secondary schools in the United Kingdom, and the average ability of pupils in the sixth form is also above the national average of pupils studying A-level courses in the United Kingdom. As of 2020/2021, Elizabeth College charges ¬£4,260 per term with three terms per academic year. A number of bursaries and scholarships are available to pupils at the school, all of which are funded by the alumni association and benefactors of the school.  Curriculum  =Structure= In the early years of the school, up to age 5, the curriculum follows the English early years foundation stage (EYFS) standards, mostly taught through games and play and assessed by classroom observation. Beyond the EYFS, the junior school operates its own curriculum. An Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) report praised the junior school's curriculum for informing the pupils' cultural awareness, in particular with appreciating Guernsey's own customs and culture in addition to other cultures. The upper school operates its own curriculum, which was described as providing 'an excellent range of options' and a 'flexible pattern of pupil grouping ... so that the specific needs of subjects are strongly met'. The upper school curriculum also includes timetabled personal, social, health and citizenship education lessons for years 7 and 8, as well as specialist themed days further up the school. Typically, students sit ten or more GCSEs and three or four A-levels. Assessing the quality of College's educational provision, the Independent Schools Inspectorate awarded Elizabeth College the highest rating of 'Excellent' in eight aspects and 'Good' in the other two. The inspection stated that 'In many academic ... activities pupils demonstrate high levels of knowledge and understanding as well as being both highly literate and articulate'. It described the curriculum as 'excellent', and praised the school for delivering the curriculum with 'good teaching throughout'. The breadth of the curriculum was described as 'a significant strength of the supper school', furthered by the co-educational sixth form partnership with the Ladies' College. The strength of the curriculum for informing the pupils' cultural awareness, in particular with appreciating Guernsey's own customs and culture in addition to other cultures, was also observed in the upper school where the cultural development of pupils was described as 'excellent'. = Academic performance = { class=\\"wikitable sortable floatright\\" style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%\\" +A-level results - !scope=\\"col\\"Year !scope=\\"col\\"Pass rate !scope=\\"col\\"A*‚ÄìA - !scope=\\"row\\"2020 align=center100% align=center37.6% - !scope=\\"row\\"2019 align=center100% align=center40.0% - !scope=\\"row\\"2018 align=center100% align=center26.7% - !scope=\\"row\\"2017 align=center100% align=center34.0% - !scope=\\"row\\"2016 align=center100% align=center40.8% - !scope=\\"row\\"2015 align=center100% align=center39.4% - !scope=\\"row\\"2014 align=center99% align=center33.0% - !scope=\\"row\\"2013 align=center99% align=center41.7% - !scope=\\"row\\"2012 align=center100% align=center49.1% - !scope=\\"row\\"2011 align=center100% align=center42.4% } Value-added statistics, which compare the results at GCSE and A-Level against the expectations for pupils based on assessment when they joined the school, place Elizabeth College in the top 17% of all British schools. Most pupils who leave the school after A-level study proceed to university or other further education, often to the institution of their first choice. Nine out of ten leavers secure places at their first choice UK universities, and many secure places at Russell Group universities. The school consistently achieves A-level pass rates of 100%, with between 80‚Äì90% being graded between A*‚ÄìC and about a third being grades A*‚ÄìA. In 2020, 37.6% of A-levels were graded A*‚ÄìA, and the highest proportion of A*‚ÄìA grades in recent times was 49.1% in 2012. At GCSE, the school regularly achieves a 99% pass rate of 5 grades 9‚Äì4/A*‚ÄìC including English and Maths, significantly higher than the national average of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. In 2017, 99% of students from Elizabeth College achieved five or more grades 9‚Äì4/A*‚ÄìC including English and Maths compared to the national average of 66%. Analysing GCSE results, the 2015 ISI inspection found that 'around half of the grades achieved were A* and A grades', and that 'following analysis [using] national data for the years 2012 to 2014 ... GCSE performance has been above the UK average for boys in maintained schools, and similar to the UK average for boys in maintained selective schools' as well as finding that 'IGCSE results in history and maths have been higher than ... worldwide norms'. They also stated that 'A-level results have been above the UK average for boys in maintained schools, and similar to the UK average for boys in maintained selective schools. Over this period, just under three-quarters of the grades were in the range A* to B'.  Extracurricular activities  = Sport = The College Field, where students play cricket during the summer term The school has been very successful in island, regional and national competitions, and has traditionally focused on three major sports ‚Äì hockey, football and cricket ‚Äì throughout the school year; one in each school term. In 2018, The Cricketer magazine named Elizabeth College as one of the top 100 cricketing secondary schools in the United Kingdom. Several alumni have gone on to compete at international level, with a number going on to win medals at both the Summer Olympics and the Commonwealth Games. Representing Great Britain, Old Elizabethan Carl Hester won a gold medal in the at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Team Dressage event. Hockey became a recognised school sport in 1910 and is the primary sport option during Michaelmas term; students play on the Memorial Field and regular matches against rivals Victoria College have been run since 1924. Football is the main winter sport played during Lent term with sessions also being held at the Memorial Field. Cricket is the main summer sport played during Trinity term and the annual cricket match against Victoria College has been running since 1862. A number of other sports are available throughout the year, including athletics, badminton, basketball, fencing, golf, rugby, sailing, rifle shooting, squash, swimming, tennis and volleyball. Outdoor activities are available and form part of school's The Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Although Elizabeth College had a fencing master on the staff as early as 1828, it was only in 2001 that fencing became a popular sport at the school. Since 2006, the school has sent a team to the annual Public Schools' Fencing Championships and other domestic competitions. In 2006, the school was named the most improved school at the Public Schools' Championships, and was crowned the best boys' team in the country, a title which they have won several times since, including eight consecutive wins from 2007‚Äì2014. In 2008, school fencers brought home a team bronze medal from the Commonwealth U20 Championships. The average age of the team was 16.5 years. = Combined Cadet Force = The school's CCF frequently takes part in local parades and services. Founded in 1902, the school's Combined Cadet Force (CCF) has its roots in the Officers' Training Corps, formed as a result of the Second Boer War. When the Royal Guernsey Militia was disbanded, the Elizabeth College CCF became the only uniformed military body in the island, and have since provided guards of honour for visiting members of the royal family. The CCF performs a number of traditional military and ceremonial duties, including the Liberation Day, Queen's Birthday and Remembrance Day parades. = Rifle shooting = Victoria College for the Haines Shield. Elizabeth College has been very successful in rifle shooting, and has attended the schools' meeting in Bisley where they have competed for the Ashburton Shield since 1906; the school has won every major trophy associated with the Ashburton, including the shield itself in 1989. At the end of the summer term, selected students combine with students from usual rivals, Victoria College, to represent the Channel Islands in the Cadet International match at Bisley. Since 1904, the school has competed against Victoria College for the Haines Shield. From 1929 onward, the shield was awarded to the higher finisher in the Ashburton between the schools, although prior to 1929, the Haines was contested separately. Victoria College has also won the Ashburton shield once, winning in 1961. As of 2018, Elizabeth College has won the Haines shield 42 times, trailing Victoria College who have won the Haines shield 66 times, including when the shield was shared in 1929. A number of school alumni have distinguished themselves in individual target shooting competitions. Charles Trotter twice competed at the Olympic Games, won a bronze medal at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, and won the Queen's Prize in 1975. The St George's Vase has been won by three alumni: Geoff Martel, Mike Martel and Frank Le Maitre. Nick Mace won the Silver Cross at the Imperial Meeting in 2008. Many other alumni have shot in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Many school marksmen have represented Great Britain as members of the British Cadet Rifle Team, commonly referred to as the 'Athelings', and the Great Britain Under-19 Rifle Team. Having been at the school for twenty-five years since his appointment in 1990, former shooting master Rick Le Page was awarded the British Empire Medal for service to the sport of target shooting in Guernsey following his retirement in 2015, having coached many young marksmen who would go on and shoot for the island and for Great Britain. = Music and Drama = Elizabeth College has a tradition of musical accomplishment, with approximately 40% of pupils learning a musical instrument. With a purpose-built performing arts studio for music and drama, there are several musical groups available for students to join. An Independent Schools Inspectorate commented in 2015 that 'many pupils achieve distinctions and merits in their instrumental music examinations'. Drama is a popular subject and extra-curricular activity at the school. Each year a number of stage productions are performed, with past years staging Journey's End, Macbeth, The Importance of Being Earnest, Oliver! and The Wizard of Oz. As well as the opportunity to audition for an acting role in the productions, students also design and operate the technical elements of each show. Productions are often done in collaboration with the Ladies' College or Blanchelande College.  Buildings and sites  =Main buildings= coat of arms of the school's foundress, Elizabeth I, is displayed above the main entrance of the school. The school remains a landmark on the skyline of Saint Peter Port. Since its foundation in 1563, Elizabeth College has been based on the same grounds as the original school. Overlooking the town and harbour of Saint Peter Port, the school site covers , extending from College Street up the Grange until Upland Road. Originally, the main school buildings were on the part of the site which now houses the Science department, the oldest remaining building being the cottage on the corner of the current campus, near to the top of Smith Street. The new building, commissioned in 1824 to a design by architect John Wilson, was started in 1826 and formally opened on 20 August 1829. Its design was described unfavourably by David T. Ansted and Robert Gordon Latham in their 1862 publication The Channel Islands, saying \\"The present structure, unfortunately harmonising in its utter tastelessness with other modern buildings in the island, was erected at great cost, and presents a bald, plastered, unmeaning face, too prominent to be overlooked.\\" The building remains a prominent feature on the skyline of St Peter Port, and accommodates the central classrooms and offices. The school's 450th-anniversary celebrations in 2013 saw major building developments on the main campus. The school also occupies the building situated immediately behind the main building in Upland Road. The now obsolete gatehouse has been converted into an art gallery. The weekly whole-school assembly is held at the nearby St James concert hall. In 2020, the school purchased the adjacent building, formerly occupied by the Royal Bank of Canada to provide additional space and teaching facilities. This was named Perrot Court in honour of a major donor and alumnus, Roger Perrot. =Sports facilities= The school owns two playing fields on the island. The College field is a cricket ground on Kings Road and has been owned by the school since 1888. The Memorial field was opened in the 1950s and named in memory of Old Elizabethans killed in World War II. It has been expanded over the years to twice the size of the College field. Both are used throughout the year for the schools three main sports. In 2010, the Robin Roussel Pavilion opened at the Memorial Field. As well as the two playing fields, the school has an indoor sports hall on the main site. In front of the main building is a hardcourt, built on top of an old air-raid shelter used during the occupation by German forces as a secure holding area for weapons and ammunition. The school also has an indoor 25 yard .22 rifle range situated at the bottom corner of the main school site. =Junior school= The associated Elizabeth College Junior School is located at two adjoining sites between Queen's Road and King's Road. Beechwood, the primary schoool, is located in a former nursing home in Queen's Road, a short walk away from the main school. Acorn House is located in King's Road in what was formerly the boarding house for the upper school and includes the pre-school and pre-prep departments. The building also has catering facilities and provides cooked lunches for all pupils at the junior school.  Notable alumni  The school's alumni are often referred to as Old Elizabethans. Notable alumni of the school in the military include four Victoria Cross holders, Duncan Home, John McCrea, Lewis Halliday and Wallace Le Patourel.Who was who 1971-1980, A. & C. Black, St Martin's Press, p. 465 Other alumni in the military include British Army officers Herbert Abbott and Donald Banks,Drake- Brockman, DH (ed), Elizabeth College Register, Vol II, 1931 RAF officer and heir to the Seigneur of Sark, Francis William Beaumont, Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Le Cheminant, Indian army officer Horace Searle Anderson, and Chief Commissioner of Police in South Australia, William John Peterswald. A number of notable political and judicial figures were educated at the school including several Bailiffs of Guernsey, including Thomas Godfrey Carey, William Carey, Havilland Walter de Sausmarez, Victor Gosselin Carey, Ambrose Sherwill, Sir Geoffrey Rowland and Sir Richard Collas. British Members of Parliament from the school include Conservative politician Edward Arthur Somerset; Labour politician Malcolm Wicks; and Liberal party politician Walter Wren. Lord Justice of Appeal for England and Wales, Adrian Fulford was educated at the school. There are also a number of notable school alumni in the arts and sciences. Alumni in the arts include actor Barry Jones; authors William Adolf Baillie Grohman and P.G. Wodehouse;Wodehouse, quoted in Jasen, p. 8 and Jean Hugo, artist and great-grandson of Victor Hugo; as well as journalist and novelist Robert Sherard; and engineer and author Hugh Pembroke Vowles. Alumni in the sciences includes physician and academic author Dr Norman Hay Forbes; anthropologist Arthur Maurice Hocart; John Richard Magrath, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford; egyptologist Sir Peter le Page Renouf;The Letters of Peter le Page Renouf (1822-1897), edited by Kevin J.

The school is also the alma mater of television presenters Bruce Parker and Murray Dron; UK media magnate, Ashley Highfield; clergyman, historian and social activist, James Parkes; Bishop of Blackburn, Nicholas Reade; explorer Edmund Kennedy; and plastic surgeon Simon Kay. Principals Adrian Saravia was the school's first master, as the position was then-known, but for the next two centuries after his departure, it is difficult to establish the complete succession of masters with certainty, with several tenures being marked with scandals, fraud or inadequacy, for which a number were dismissed. Principal Lawrence Payne spent eighteen months absent in England while still claiming salary as a master. Charles Stocker was the first principal appointed after the re-chartering of the school in 1824, and, after his appointment, there were portraits made of every principal of the school since 1824 (except George Proctor). The portraits are permanently on display in the Le Marchant library, situated at the very top of the middle spire of the main building. In 2017, Jenny Palmer was appointed principal, becoming the first female principal in the school's history.

The term can also refer to a state of mind in which an individual believes that they are responsible for saving or assisting others.  Religious delusion  The term \\"messiah complex\\" is not addressed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as it is not a clinical term nor diagnosable disorder. However, the symptoms of the disorder closely resemble those found in individuals suffering from delusions of grandeur or that they have grandiose self-images that veer towards the delusional. An account specifically identified it as a category of religious delusion, which pertains to strong fixed beliefs that cause distress or disability. It is the type of religious delusion that is classified as grandiose while the other two categories are: persecutory and belittlement. A poor example of this type of delusion was the case of Paul, who declared that God spoke to him, telling him that he would serve as a conduit for people to change. The so-called Kent-Flew thesis argued that his experience entailed auditory and visual hallucinations.  Examples  In terms of the attitude wherein an individual sees themselves as having to save another or a group of poor people, there is the notion that the action inflates their own sense of importance and discounts the skills and abilities of the people they are helping to improve their own lives. The messiah complex is most often reported in patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. When a messiah complex is manifested within a religious individual after a visit to Jerusalem, it may be identified as a psychosis known as Jerusalem syndrome.

There were seven major campaigns at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean Peninsula, ultimately resulting in Korea becoming a vassal state of the Mongol Yuan dynasty for approximately 80 years. The initial campaigns Fleeing from the Mongols, in 1216 the Khitans invaded Goryeo and defeated the Korean armies multiple times, even reaching the gates of the capital and raiding deep into the south, but were defeated by Korean General Kim Chwi-ryeo who pushed them back north to Pyongan, where the remaining Khitans were finished off by allied Mongol-Goryeo forces in 1219. These Khitans are possibly the origin of the Baekjeong. Gojong of Goryeo (reigned 1213‚Äì1259) was the 23rd king of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea. In 1225, the Mongol Empire demanded tribute goods from Goryeo and the Mongol envoy Chu-ku-yu was killed. His death was used by the Mongols as a pretext to invade Goryeo. In 1231, √ñgedei Khan ordered the invasion of Korea. The experienced Mongol army was placed under the command of General Saritai (not to be confused with Sartaq, a later Mongol khan). The Mongol army crossed the Yalu river and quickly secured the surrender of the border town of Uiju. The Mongols were joined by Hong Bok-won, a traitor Goryeo general. Choe Woo mobilized as many soldiers as possible into an army consisting largely of infantry, where it fought the Mongols at both Anju and Kuju (modern-day Kusong). The Mongols took Anju; however, they were forced to retreat after the Siege of Kuju. Frustrated by siege warfare, Saritai instead used his armies' superior mobility to bypass the Goryeo army and succeeded in taking the capital at Gaesong. Elements of the Mongol army reached as far as Chungju in the central Korean peninsula; however, their advance was halted by a slave army led by Ji Gwang-su where his army fought to the death. Realizing that with the fall of the capital Goryeo was unable to resist the Mongol invaders, Goryeo sued for peace. However, Mongols demanded 10,000 otter skins, 20,000 horses, 10,000 bolts of silk, clothing for 1,000,000 soldiers and a large number of children and craftsmen who would become slaves and servants of the Mongol empire. General Saritai began withdrawing his main force to the north in the spring of 1232, leaving seventy-two Mongol administrative officials stationed in various cities in northwestern Goryeo to ensure that Goryeo kept his peace terms. In 1232, Choe Woo, against the pleas of both King Gojong and many of his senior civil officials, ordered the Royal Court and most of Gaesong's population to be moved from Songdo to Ganghwa Island in the Bay of Gyeonggi, and started the construction of significant defenses to prepare for the Mongol threat. Choe Woo exploited the Mongols' primary weakness, fear of the sea. The government commandeered every available ship and barge to transport supplies and soldiers to Ganghwa Island. The evacuation was so sudden that King Kojong himself had to sleep in a local inn on the island. The government further ordered the common people to flee the countryside and take shelter in major cities, mountain citadels, or nearby offshore islands. Ganghwa Island itself was a strong defensive fortress. Smaller fortresses were built on the mainland side of the island and a double wall was also built across the ridges of Mt. Munsusan. The Mongols protested the move and immediately launched a second attack. The Mongol army was led by a traitor from Pyongyang called Hong Bok-won and the Mongols occupied much of northern Korea. Although they reached parts of the southern peninsula as well, the Mongols failed to capture Ganghwa Island, which was only a few miles from shore, and were repelled in Gwangju. The Mongol general there, Saritai (ÊííÁ¶ÆÂ°î), was killed by the monk Kim Yun-hu (ÍπÄÏú§ÌõÑ) amidst strong civilian resistance at the Battle of Cheoin near Yongin, forcing the Mongols to withdraw again. Third campaign and treaty In 1235, the Mongols began a campaign that ravaged parts of Gyeongsang and Jeolla Provinces. Civilian resistance was strong, and the Royal Court at Ganghwa attempted to strengthen its fortress. Goryeo won several victories but the Goryeo military and Righteous armies could not withstand the waves of invasions. After the Mongols were unable to take either Ganghwa Island or Goryeo's mainland mountain castles, the Mongols began to burn Goryeo farmland in an attempt to starve the populace. When some fortresses finally surrendered, the Mongols executed everyone who resisted them. In 1238, Goryeo relented and sued for peace. The Mongols withdrew, in exchange for Goryeo's agreement to send the Royal Family as hostages. However, Goryeo sent an unrelated member of the Royal line. Incensed, the Mongols demanded to clear the seas of Korean ships, relocate the court to the mainland, the hand-over of anti-Mongol bureaucrats, and, again, the Royal family as hostages. In response, Korea sent a distant princess and ten children of nobles. Fourth and fifth campaigns In 1247, the Mongols began the fourth campaign against Goryeo, again demanding the return of the capital to Songdo and the Royal Family as hostages. G√ºy√ºk sent Amuqan to Korea and the Mongols camped near Yomju in July 1247. After the king Gojong of Goryeo refused to move his capital from Ganghwa island to Songdo, Amuqan's force pillaged the Korean Peninsula. With the death of G√ºy√ºk Khan in 1248, however, the Mongols withdrew again. But the Mongol raids continued until 1250. Upon the 1251 ascension of M√∂ngke Khan, the Mongols again repeated their demands. M√∂ngke Khan sent envoys to Goryeo, announcing his coronation in October 1251. He also demanded the King Gojong be summoned before him in person and his headquarters be moved from Ganghwa Island to the Korean mainland. But the Goryeo court refused to send the king because the old king was unable to travel so far. M√∂ngke again dispatched his envoys with specific tasks. The envoys were well received by the Goryeo officials but they also criticized them, saying their king did not follow his overlord M√∂ngke's orders.J. Bor Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, boyi II, p.254 M√∂ngke ordered the prince Yeku to command the army against Korea. However, a Korean in the court of M√∂ngke convinced them to begin their campaign in July 1253. Yeku, along with Amuqan, demanded the Goryeo court to surrender. The court refused but did not resist the Mongols and gathered the peasantry into the mountain fortresses and islands. Working together with the Goryeo commanders who had joined the Mongols, Jalairtai Qorchi ravaged Korea. When one of Yeku's envoys arrived, Gojong personally met him at his new palace in Sin Chuan-bug. Gojong finally agreed to move the capital back to the mainland, and sent his stepson Angyeong as a hostage. The Mongols agreed to a cease fire in January 1254. Sixth campaign and peace The Mongols later learned that top Goryeo officials remained on Ganghwa Island, and had punished those who negotiated with the Mongols. Between 1253 and 1258, the Mongols under Jalairtai launched four devastating invasions in the final successful campaign against Korea. M√∂ngke realized that the hostage was not the blood prince of the Goryeo Dynasty. So M√∂ngke blamed the Goryeo court for deceiving him and killing the family of Lee Hyeong, who was a pro-Mongol Korean general. M√∂ngke' commander Jalairtai devastated much of Goryeo and took 206,800 captives in 1254.John Man Kublai Khan, p.208 Famine and despair forced peasants to surrender to the Mongols. They established a chiliarchy office at Yonghung with local officials. Ordering defectors to build ships, the Mongols began attacking the coastal islands from 1255 onward.C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.319 In the Liaodong Peninsula, the Mongols eventually massed Korean defectors into a colony of 5,000 households. In 1258, the king and the Choe clan retainer Kim Unjin staged a counter-coup, assassinated the head of the Choe family and sued for peace. When the Goryeo court sent the future king Wonjong as hostage to the Mongol court and promised to return to Kaegyong, the Mongols withdrew from Central Korea. There were two parties within Goryeo: the literati party, which opposed the war with the Mongols, and the military junta‚Äîled by the Choe clan‚Äîwhich pressed for continuing the war. When the dictator Choe was murdered by the literati party, the peace treaty was concluded.Íµ≠Î∞©Î∂Ä Íµ∞ÏÇ¨Ìé∏Ï∞¨Ïó∞Íµ¨ÏÜå, Í≥†Î†§ÏãúÎåÄ Íµ∞ÏÇ¨ Ï†ÑÎûµ (2006) (The Ministry of National Defense, Military Strategies in Goryeo) The treaty permitted the maintenance of the sovereign power and traditional culture of Goryeo, implying that the Mongols gave up incorporating Goryeo under direct Mongolian control and were content to give Goryeo autonomy, but the king of Goryeo must marry a Mongolian princess and be subordinate to the Mongolian Khans.Íµ≠ÏÇ¨Ìé∏Ï∞¨ÏúÑÏõêÌöå, Í≥†Îì±ÌïôÍµêÍµ≠ÏÇ¨ÍµêÍ≥ºÏÑú p63(National Institute of Korean History, History for High School Students, p64) Aftermath Much of Goryeo was devastated after the decades of fighting. It was said that no wooden structures remained afterward in Goryeo. There was cultural destruction, and the Hwangnyongsa and the first Tripitaka Koreana were destroyed. After seeing the Goryeo crown prince come to concede, Kublai Khan was jubilant and said \\"Goryeo is a country that long ago even Tang Taizong personally campaigned against but was unable to defeat, but now the crown prince comes to me, it is the will of heaven!\\"http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=110138 Internal struggles within the royal court continued regarding the peace with the Mongols until 1270. Since Choe Chung-heon, Goryeo had been a military dictatorship, ruled by the private army of the powerful Choe family. Some of these military officials formed the Sambyeolcho Rebellion (1270‚Äì1273) and resisted in the islands off the southern shore of the Korean peninsula. Beginning with Wonjong, for approximately 80 years, Goryeo was a vassal state and compulsory ally of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. The Mongols and Koreans rulers were also tied by marriages as some Mongol prince and aristocrats married Korean princesses and vice versa. During the reign of Kublai Khan, King Chungnyeol of Goryeo married one of Kublai's daughters. Later, a Korean princess called the Empress Gi became an empress through her marriage with Ukhaantu Khan, and her son, Biligt√º Khan of Northern Yuan, became a Mongol Khan. The Kings of Goryeo held an important status like other important families of Mardin, Uyghurs and Mongols (Oirat, Hongirat, and Ikeres).Ed. Morris Rossabi China among equals: the Middle Kingdom and its neighbors, 10th-14th centuries, p.244 It is claimed that one of Goryeo monarchs was the most beloved grandson of Kublai Khan and had grown up at the Yuan court.Baasanjavyin Lkhagvaa Solongos, Mongol- Solongosyin harilstaanii ulamjlalaas, p.172 The Mongol darughachis at the court of the Goryeo were offered provisions and sometimes were also willing to actively involved in the affairs of the Goryeo court. Part of Jeju Island converted to a grazing area for the Mongol cavalry stationed there. Even today, there are several Mongolian words used in the Jeju Island.Examples of such words include colors of horses, Agibato-a hero boy and Songgol-falcon, see Baasanjavyin Lkhagvaa-Solongos, Mongol-Solongosyin harilstaanii ulamjlalaas, p.173 for more information. Furthermore, the Mongol domination of Eurasia encouraged cultural exchange, and this would include for example the transmission of some of the Korean ideas and technology to other areas under Mongol control.Thomas T. Allsen Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.53Namjil Solongos-Mongolyin haritsaa: Ert, edugee, p.64 The Goryeo dynasty survived under influence of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty until it began to force Mongolian garrisons back starting in the 1350s, when the Yuan Dynasty was already beginning to crumble, suffering from massive rebellions in China. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Goryeo king Gongmin also managed to regain some northern territories.

The Escape from Alcatraz originated in 1981 as a private club event, beginning in San Francisco and ending in Marin County. The race split in 1983 with a separate commercial event open to the public, which is now an aquathlon (having dropped the biking section of a traditional triathlon) held on a shorter course entirely within San Francisco.\\"About the Alcatraz Aquathlon & Swim\\" , based on an article written by Katherine Vaz in the 1983 summer edition of Triathlon Magazine, accessed April 11, 2007 However, a new public triathlon, also known by the name Escape from Alcatraz, is now run by IMG. Original Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon The first Escape from Alcatraz was proposed by Joe Oakes after he participated in the 1979 Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii. The first Escape from Alcatraz race was held two years later in June 1981, with members of the Dolphin Club testing the course. The course started with a swim from Alcatraz Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay to the city of San Francisco, a bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Mill Valley in Marin County, and an out-and-back running course over Mount Tamalpais to Stinson Beach and back. The running course followed the course of the Dipsea foot race, but by making it an out-and-back run rather than a one-way course, became known as a Double Dipsea. The course has remained the same over the years and celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2015. Participants are limited to members of the Dolphin Club and The South End Club. The Dolphin Club is the host and sponsor of the event.http://dcefat.com Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon (IMG) The annual public Escape from Alcatraz triathlon, organized by IMG, now takes place in early June. The current course consists of a swim starting near Alcatraz Island, a run from the bay to the transition zone at Marina Green, an bike ride, and an run. The run portion includes a notorious section called the \\"sand ladder\\" at mile five, a climb from Baker Beach back up to the road that is a combination of sand and about 400 uneven log steps. The event had about 1700 participants in 2009. Entry is by Lottery process for most of the slots and the remainder is through qualification, which done through a good rank in the previous Escape from Alcatraz, or in four other triathlon races held during the preceding year. While entry is via lottery, they give preference to previous entrants. The one exception to the June timeframe was when the Americas Cup sailing event came to the Bay Area. The resulting shift to March resulted in colder than normal conditions (swim) and more challenging tides than the normal date. The impact of this was a 3 fold increase in swimmers 'rescued' from the water, many more than normal were pulled out and transported to shallow water. They were allowed to continue the event and receive medals for finishing. The Escape from Alcatraz triathlon was ranked as the number-one triathlon by Inside Triathlon Magazine for 2006.

At least 229,000 people died after the Banqiao Dam collapsed (in Zhumadian, Henan Province, China) and devastated areas downstream. The collapse of the dam due to heavy floods also caused a string of smaller dams to collapse, adding to the damage caused by the typhoon. Meteorological history A well defined trough line extending southeastward into the Philippine Sea spawned a disturbance on July 29. After its initial status as a disturbance, Tropical Depression 04W was designated and moved southwestward for 36 hours as the structure of the system began to organize. On July 31, the depression slowed and began to rapidly intensify, becoming a tropical storm and was named \\"Nina\\". It began to turn to the northwest afterward. A subtropical ridge prevented Nina from turning further north and it began to track west-northwest just before reaching typhoon intensity. Nina underwent explosive development on the late hours of August 1. Aircraft reconnaissance reported a 65 hPa drop of pressure, increasing from a mere 65 kn (75 mph, 120 km/h) to 130 kt (150 mph, 240 km/h) the day after. During that period, it attained its peak intensity of 135 kn (155 mph, 250 km/h). The typhoon began to weaken as it approached Taiwan, making landfall near the coastal city of Hualien as a Category 3 storm with 100 kn (115 mph, 185 km/h) winds. JTWC's ATCR on the 1975 typhoon season The storm began to weaken as it went across the island's central mountain range, sparing the most populated areas from the eyewall. It entered the Formosa Straits as a weak typhoon, making another landfall near Jinjiang, Fujian.http://www.hnqx.cn/xqhy/xq_view.jsp?id=6814 Pan Jiazheng, the progress of the 1975 flood After moving northwest and crossing Jiangxi, it turned north on the night of August 5 near Changde, Hunan. A day later, the storm moved over Xinyang, Henan, and was later blocked by a cold front near Zhumadian, Henan for three days.Monsoons Over China by Ding Yihui, Springer 1994 edition (December 31, 1993), page 229. The stationary thunderstorm system brought heavy rainfall, causing the infamous collapse of the Banqiao Dam. The storm moved southwest on August 8, and dissipated soon afterwards. Impact =Taiwan= Upon making landfall in Taiwan, the storm brought winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) to places near the storm's eye. Wind gusts were also measured up to . Widespread heavy rainfall, peaking around , from the storm triggered deadly flooding and landslides which killed 29 people and injured 168 others. Reports from the island indicate that 3,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by the typhoon. In the city of Hualien alone, four people were killed, 561 homes were destroyed, and 1,831 more homes were damaged. Across the island, domestic flights, trains, and bus services were all suspended due to the storm; however, Taipei Songshan Airport remained open for international flights. =Mainland China= Due to the interaction with the mountains of Taiwan, Nina weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall in mainland China. The storm crossed the coastline with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph); however, little damage resulted near where the system struck land. Further inland, the remnants of the storm produced widespread torrential rainfall, with more than falling across an area of 19,410 km2 (7,500 mi2). The heaviest rainfall was recorded along the Banqiao Dam where of rain fell, of which fell in a six-hour span. These rains led to the collapse of the Banqiao Dam, which received 1-in-2000-year flood conditions. In all, 62 dams failed during the disaster, causing large temporary lakes and $1.2 billion (1975 USD) in damage.Anderson- Berry 5-1 paper See also * List of tropical cyclones * Banqiao Dam * Cyclone Nargis * 1970 Bhola cyclone ‚Äì Deadliest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide References External links * Nina 1975 best track data * Joint Typhoon Warning Center * FIFTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON TROPICAL CYCLONES TOPIC 2.1 Observing and forecasting rainfall * 27th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology Category:Tropical cyclone articles needing attention Category:1975 Pacific typhoon season Category:Typhoons in Taiwan Category:Typhoons in China Typhoon Nina Category:Typhoons ","title":"Typhoon Nina (1975)"},{"id":"3899585","text":"Location of Varna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands.

Lying on the A4054 road it is on the east bank of the River Taff. The community includes the villages of Aberfan on the opposite side of the Taff, Mount Pleasant and the village of Merthyr Vale itself. Ynys Owen The area was referred to and written as Ynys Owen as early as 1630, noting that the narrow valley was heavily wooded, with various traditional Tyddyns (long-house farms) marking out the various rural farming territories. Ynys Owen, which translates from Welsh to English as Owain‚Äôs riverside meadow, has been claimed by some to possibly commemorate Owain Glyn Dwr, whose followers were involved in an uprising around 1400. Industrial development There had been small scale coal extraction at Danyderi and Perthygleision, but in 1869 John Nixon started development of the Taff Colliery, later to be known as the Merthyr Vale Colliery. The village immediately grew up around the shaft development, as did the later communities of Aberfan, Nixonville and Mount Pleasant. Completed in 1875, when the first commercial coal was brought up, there was a celebration called in the local Windsor Hotel. History As the colliery was not the first developed in the area, and as colliery developers and owners were known to generally restrict spending on surrounding communities in which they housed their workers, Merthyr Tydfil council insisted on Merthyr Vale being developed with both adequate sanitation, as well as community infrastructure. Resultant planning regulations stipulated that the Parish had effective sanitary and water supplies from the beginning. The village had developed sufficiently to create The Merthyr Vale Silver Prize Band - which won the Gwent Eisteddfod in 1905 and 1905, under conductor G.H. Thomas.A Welsh Uncle, memories of Tom Morgan 1898-1957, John Dann, FastPrint Peterborourgh 2018 Religious buildings included chapels and churches for: Zion, Baptist, Calfaria, Welsh Baptist Bethel, Wesleyan Methodist, Disgwylfa, Calvinist Methodist and Trinity, Presbyterian. Zion and Calfaria merged in 1974 to form the modern Baptist Church at Nixonville, which contains the first fibre-glass Baptistry built in Wales. St Benedict‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church was built in 1932. The Anglican Church of St Mary and Holy Innocents was built in 1974; replacing the earlier church which was built, with help from Merthyr Vale Colliery, in 1926. The former Merthyr Vale School was built in 1879, while the Mount Pleasant School dates from 1912. Merthyr Vale railway station opened in 1883. The Gordon Lennox Constitutional Club was built in 1901, by the proprietor of the Brown-Lennox Engineering Company in Pontypridd, also the President of the East Glamorgan Conservative. Travellers hotels and pubs that opened within the community included: The Aberfan Hotel, The Mackintosh Hotel (closed) both in Aberfan, Mount Pleasant Inn,http://themountpleasantinn.co.uk/ Station Hotel (closed) and Windsor hotel http://www.windsorhoteluk.com/ Cardiff road Merthyr Vale. In World War II, while on a training exercise from No. 53 Operational Training Unit, see List of Royal Air Force Operational Training Units two Royal Canadian Air Force Supermarine Spitfires collided over the village on 7 July 1941. The aircraft (X4024) of Sgt Gerald Fenwick Manuel (R/69888), 25, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, crashed into the home of the Cox family, claiming the lives of Doreen Cox 33, and her two daughters Phyllis, 14 and Doreen, 3. Husband James Cox, who was a shift worker at a munitions factory and was asleep in the house at the time of the crash, was thrown to safety; their three boys, Donald, Thomas and Len, were out playing. Neighbours tried to rescue the family - who had just returned from a shopping trip - but the heat from the fire was too intense. The second aircraft (X4607) of Sgt Lois \\"Curly\\" Goldberg (R/56185), 27, from Montreal, crashed into a field in Mount Pleasant, Treharris. The bodies of Sgt Manuel and the deceased family members were buried two days later in Ffrwd Cemetery, Merthyr Tydfil, while the body of Sgt Goldberg was interned in the Jewish cemetery at Cefn-coed-y-cymmer.

River gravel is a name given to gravel composed of small pieces of rounded stone of various colors, usually no larger than a large coin. It is named for the effect of many years of rounding of the edges of the stones due to a flow of water over it, as often takes place in a river. River gravel is often used in outdoor settings, such as a park walkway. When a hard surface is also desired, river gravel is often set in a concrete aggregate mix. Owing to much higher cost than either asphalt or concrete pavement, the use of river gravel is generally limited to places where the appearance and/or its lack of sharp edges (when used alone) is of primary importance. The American National Park Service's bucolic Colonial Parkway, linking the three points of Virginia's Historic Triangle, has a road surface of river gravel set in concrete aggregate. Built between 1930 and 1957, the Colonial Parkway is possibly the longest roadway open to the public which is surfaced of the material. River gravel is also occasionally used for landscaping purposes and placed by landscape architects in non-traffic areas of high visibility. It may be used with many plants and shrubs because the rounded surfaces ensure rain and other water will soak through to reach the roots for necessary nurture.

It is located about west of Trelewis, from which it is separated by the Taff Bargoed river, and from Nelson in Caerphilly county borough and has a population of 6,356 from the 2011 Census. As a community, Treharris includes the villages of Quakers Yard and Edwardsville. Due to steepness and narrowness of both the Taff and Taff Bargoed valleys at Treharris several notable bridges and viaducts have been built in the area.Davies (2008), pg 554.  History  The town was formed around Harris's Deep Navigation Colliery, which begun coal mining excavations in 1878, after sinking started in 1872. The colliery and village were named after F. W. Harris and his Harris Navigation Steam Coal Company. Originally known as Harris's Navigation Pits, the Deep Navigation shafts were the deepest at the time in South Wales. With the some shafts sunk to a depth of 760 yards (2,280 feet, 695 metres) to access the Nine Feet Seam, 200 yards (600 feet, 183 metres) deeper than any other colliery in the coalfield.Thomas (1979), pg 27. Ownership transferred to the Ocean Coal Co. Ltd. in 1893 - so called because the pit supplied the coal for the transatlantic ocean liners, including the Cunard Line. The pit became known as Deep Navigation Colliery and remained in production until 1991. During the early 21st century, like many ex-mining villages in the area, Treharris underwent significant regeneration to the town/village centre. Most, if not all of the land where Deep Navigation was situated has been landscaped and is now part of the new Parc Taff Bargoed, where many of the local football and rugby teams train and play. Governance Treharris is also the name of an electoral ward whose boundaries are coterminous with the community. The Treharris ward elects three county councillors to Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. Since 1995 the ward has elected a mixture of Labour Party or Independent councillors. In May 2017 the Labour Party won all three seats.Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012, The Election Centre.

Quakers Yard is part of the community of Treharris. History Ysgol Rhyd Y Grug The early place name for the district was 'Rhyd y Grug' or 'The Ford of the Rustling Waters'. This ford was a simple and easy crossing place of the nearby River Taff, close to its junction with the smaller Taff Bargoed river. The ford was replaced in later years by the narrow stone bridge over the River Taff. Quakers Yard railway station opened in 1858. During the early 17th century those who 'dissented' from the King's Religion were persecuted. This often took the form of imprisonment, or death. By about 1650 a 'dissenting group' of Baptists, independents and Quakers were worshipping at nearby Berthlwyd Farm, Pentwyn (Top of the Hill). The Quakers in turn, soon broke away to establish their own separate community. In the year 1667, these Quakers opened their own Quaker burial ground. It was on a piece of land on the Pantannas Estate and was owned by Mary Chapman. In her will of 1700, she left the burial ground to the Quakers. However, this burial ground was very small as the Quakers did not want to draw attention to it. To find this burial ground now is even harder as a new road in Quakers Yard was built through this site. Notable people The Jacobite David Morgan, executed for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1745, lived at the farm of Penygraig on the hillside north of Edwardsville. One of the most famous British boxers of all time, Jimmy Wilde (1892‚Äì1969) was born at Pentwyn Deintyr, Quakers Yard. Known as 'The ghost with the Hammer in his hand', he fought 864 contests and lost on 4 occasions only. He was Flyweight Champion of the World (Universal) from 1916 to 1921.

While Wolf was devoted to minority rights, he opposed Jewish nationalism as expressed in Zionism, which he regarded an incentive to anti-Semitism. In 1917 he co- founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews. Early life He was the son of Edward Wolf, a London pipe manufacturer, and his wife C√©line (born Redlich). Wolf's father was a Bohemian Jew who came to England as a political refugee after the 1848 revolution, and his mother was Viennese.Levene, Mark, Wolf, Lucien (1857‚Äì1930), journalist and lobbyist in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004)Levene, Mark, Jews and the new Europe: the diplomacy of Lucien Wolf, 1914‚Äì1919 (1992)  Career in journalism  Wolf began his career in journalism as early as 1874, at the age of seventeen, becoming a writer for the Jewish World and remaining at this position until 1894; from 1905 to 1908 he would serve as its editor. He specialized in foreign affairs and diplomacy and became a highly respected expert on the subject. In 1877 he became assistant director of the Public Leader. From 1890 to 1909 he was foreign editor of The Daily Graphic, writing under the pseudonym Diplomaticus. From 1895 to 1905 he wrote under the same pseudonym for the Fortnightly Review. As indicated by his pseudonym, Wolf's writings dealt primarily foreign affairs and diplomacy and he became a respected expert in these fields.Guide to the Papers of Lucien Wolf(1857-1930) .... YIVO Institute for Jewish Research Mirror page: http://digifindingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109129 The outbreak of the anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia in 1881 sparked his interest in Jewish affairs. He became a sharp critic of the Czarist regime and attempted to draw attention to the plight of Russian Jews. In 1912 Wolf founded and wrote a supplement named Darkest Russia to the Jewish Chronicle. With the outbreak of the First World War, Wolf's preference for the more liberal German government to the Russian practically ended his career in journalism, as the British were allied with Russia against Germany.  Anglo-Jewry  Wolf was an enthusiast for Jewish history, and promoting Jewishness. In London he organised the 1887 Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition charting the immigration of Jews to Britain from across Europe over the centuries. In 1893, Wolf was one of the founders and the first president of the Jewish Historical Society of England. His historical writings rarely extended beyond the aristocracy, exhibiting his own upper-middle class pretensions. Against racial anti-Semitism, he championed Judaism, even offering eugenic justifications for its superiority.  Anti- Zionism  Lucien Wolf was opposed to political Zionism. As an assimilationist, he believed Jewry was a spiritual and religious identity and not a nation. He vigorously opposed the new Zionist movement, that had been formed in Manchester. As a powerful editor, Wolf had access to ministers, whom he lobbied frantically to prevent the issuing of the Balfour Declaration.Wolf to Abrahams, 30 October 1916, MWS1693 When the Declaration was made public on 2 November 1917, he soon co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews. Wolf understood Nahum Sokolow and Chaim Weizmann's position as threatening the nationality status of British Jews, and wrote \\"No wonder that all anti-semites are enthusiastic Zionists\\". The yearning for a home land was historical and fundamental to the essence or quintessence of Jewishness. But to Wolf this \\"yearning\\" was primarily only religious.  Conjoint Committee  In 1888, Lucien Wolf became a member of the Conjoint Foreign Committee (CFC), a coordinating organ of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo- Jewish Association. Around the start of the First World War, he was appointed secretary, which led to his contacts at the British Foreign Office. He served effectively as \\"Foreign Secretary\\" representing Anglo-Jewry, having frequent meetings with members of the Cabinet. After the CFC had published an anti- Zionist manifest in May 1917 without first consulting the Board of Deputies and AJA, the Committee was criticized and the mainly pro-Zionist Board of Deputies withdrew its delegates from the CFC. By the end of 1917 the Committee was re-established under the new name Conjoint Foreign Committee (JFC). This time, the AJA was allotted a minority of members in the Committee. Lucien Wolf became again its secretary and held this function until his death in 1930.  1919 and after  Wolf was part of the Anglo-Jewish delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. He helped draft the Minority Treaties, which guaranteed rights for ethnic, religious, and linguistic minority populations. The Jewish delegations to the conference were split along different ideological lines. Western Europeans were cautious of both Zionism and diaspora nationalism, wanting Jews to be integrated with society. During the 1920s anti-Semitism became more intensive and organised, particularly in Poland, which had one of Europe's largest Jewish minority populations. The following year in 1926, he went to Portugal to aid the Marranos.

The breakaway Transnistria failed to come into an agreement with the central government in Chi≈üinƒÉu, and carried out its own census between November 11 and November 18, 2004. The results of the census in Transnistria were put into question. Moldova's previous census was performed in 1989, when the territory of the country was part of the former Soviet Union. The census was delayed several times and had difficulties because of political problems, ethnic tensions, and a lack of financial resources. Terminology The questionnaires used the term \\"Nationality\\", but the sense of this term must be understood as a synonym of ethnicity,\\"Official Chisinau Seeks Recognition Of Moldovan Ethnicity And Minority In Romania\\" The Jamestown Foundation, February 28, 2007, by Vladimir Socor. as nation can also be defined as a grouping based on language and cultural self-determination rather than on relations with a sovereign state. In the context of former the Soviet Union, nationality is often used as translation of the Russian terms (–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å / natsional'nost) used for ethnic groups, and local affiliations within the post-Soviet countries. Criticism According to a May 19, 2005 article carried by the Moldova Azi news agency, the expert group of the International Census Observation Mission to the Republic of Moldova described the Moldovan census as \\"generally conducted in a professional manner\\", but consider that \\"there were a few topics in the census that were potentially more problematic\\". These were: #The expert group considered that the released total figure may actually be somewhat higher than the real population size of the country, because it includes at least some Moldovans who had been living abroad over one year at the time of the census, and who had been enumerated in the census. According to the international standards for censuses, these individuals should not have been included in the count of the total population size of the country. However, the experts also remarked that some undercount of the population can also be expected in any census operations, and that this might reduce the effect of the above-mentioned overcount. #The expert group concluded that the items in the questionnaire dealing with nationality and language proved to be the most sensitive, particularly with reference to the recording of responses to these questions as being \\"Moldovan\\" or \\"Romanian\\". While a large proportion of the population had spontaneously provided an answer to the question, seven of the ten teams of observers had reported cases where enumerators encouraged respondents to declare that they were Moldovan rather than Romanian. Moreover, the reports from the field also showed that even within the same family there often seemed to be some confusion about these terms. Since problems of this type had been reported by the teams of observers in many different parts of the country, and in fairly large number, the expert group concluded that special care would be required by the National Statistics Bureau to enable it to assess the quality of the data on nationality/ethnicity. The expert group recommended that the Moldovan National Bureau of Statistics carry out an evaluation study, offered its assistance in doing so, and indicated its intention of further studying the matter itself.Experts Offering to Consult the National Statistics Bureau in Evaluation of the Census Data, Moldova Azi, May 19, 2005, story attributed to AP Flux.

Retrieved January 21, 2009. Vitalie Valcov, the then director of the Department of Statistics and Sociology, stated that Transnistria did not comply with the international recommendations for carrying out a census and, thus, the data collected in Transnistria -- where almost 17% of Moldova's population live -- may not be taken together with the data from the rest of Moldova, since it was gathered without international monitoring. Therefore, all census figures released by the Department of Statistics and Sociology do not include territories that are under the control of the breakaway Transnistrian authorities.

Shiwu was born in the town of Changshu. Taking his name from the Shihwutung (Stonehouse cave) in Yushan. In 1292 Shiwu became a novice at Yushan's Hsingfu temple, a major monastic center at the time. He studied under master Yung-Wei and three years later was ordained and received the dharma name Ch'ing-hung.The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit, Red Pine, 1999, p. xi Biography He is said to have followed a monk to the Tianmu Mountains to meet with Chan master Kao-Feng. On his arrival Kao-feng asked why he came to his hermitage to which Shiwu answered \\"I've come for the Dharma\\". Kao-feng said \\"The Dharma isn't so easy to find. You've got to burn your fingers for incense\\". Shiwu replied \\"But I see the Master before me with my own eyes. How could the Dharma be hidden?\\". Kao-feng took him as his pupil and gave him the koan \\"All things return to one\\" for study.The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit, Red Pine, 1999, p. xi =Chi-an= After three years with little progress, Shiwu decided to leave and Kao-feng recommended he study under the Chan master Chi-an. Shiwu crossed the Yangtze and met Chi-an at West Peak Temple near Chienyang. Chi-an asked Shiwu what teaching he had received. Shiwu said, \\"All things return to one\\". Chi-an asked what it meant and Shiwu remained silent. Chi-an said \\"Those words are dead. Where did you pick up such rot?\\". Shiwu bowed and asked for instruction. Chi- an then gave him another koan: \\"Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past\\". Shiwu said he didn't understand but decided to stay with Chi-an.The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit, Red Pine, 1999, p. xii One day, Chi-an asked once more about the koan and Shiwu answered, \\"When you mount the horse, you see the road\\". Chi-an admonished him once again. Shiwu left but on his way down the mountain he saw a pavilion and had a sudden insight. He turned back and told Chi-an, \\"Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Those are dead words. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past. Those are dead words too. Now I understand living words\\". Chi-an asked him what he understood and Shiwu answered, \\"When the rain finally stops in late spring, the oriole appears on a branch\\"(cf. Confucius says, \\"When the oriole rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible man isn't equal to this bird?\\" - D√† Xu√© 3.2).The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit, Red Pine, 1999, p. xii Chi-an later served as abbot of the Taochang temple and Shiwu joined him. Shiwu also served as a meditation teacher in Lingyin temple. =Poet= In 1312 at the age of forty he moved to Xiamu Mountain near Huzhou to live as a hermit and it is here that he composed his \\"Mountain Poems\\" (Shan-shih), one-hundred and eighty-four verses mostly dealing with life in the mountains. In the preface to the Mountain poems, Shiwu writes: > Here in the woods I have lots of free time. When I don't spend it sleeping, > I enjoy composing gathas. But with paper and ink so scarce, I haven't > thought of writing them down. Now some Zen monks have asked me to record > what I find of interest on this mountain. I've sat here quietly and let my > brush fly. Suddenly, this volume is full. I close it and sent it back down > with the admonition not to try singing these poems. Only if you sit on them > will they do you any good.The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a > 14th-Century Chinese Hermit, Red Pine, 1999, p. 1 The opening poem of the Shan-Shi describes the natural setting of his hermitage: :I made my home west of the Sha :where water fills Sky Lake and the moon fills the river :people are frightened when they see the heights :but once they arrive they know the trail :dried snail shells on rock walls :fresh tiger tracks in the mud :my door stays open when spring days grow long :when paulownias bloom and cicadas call Many of his poems deal with the mundane facets of everyday hermit life. :I don't stop moving all day :long before sunset I'm done :back home I wash off my feet and sleep :too tired to notice the mountain moon's passage :birds wake me up from a distant grove :the red sun's disc shines through the pines :today and tomorrow don't differ :the years are all the same. Some of the poems also focus on Zen Buddhist philosophical ideals like impermanence and non-attachment. :This body's existence is like a bubble's :may as well accept what happens :events and hopes seldom agree :but who can step back doesn't worry :we blossom and fade like flowers :gather and part like clouds :worldly thoughts I forgot long ago :relaxing all day on a peak.

The \\"Next-Gen\\" Era  Beginning with Hypericon 11, organizers engaged in a modernization effort for the convention (internally deemed \\"Hypericon Next-Gen\\"), adopting new branding and a larger scope of content, guests, and fandom. Attendance doubled in the single year between 2015 and 2016 and a 2-4x increase is expected in 2017. Upon the cancelation of another local multi-genre convention, Geek Media Expo (GMX), interest in the market has been shifting to Hypericon.  Infinity Membership  In 2017, the convention began offering its take on a lifetime badge - the \\"Infinity Membership.\\" This membership class, launched at a price of $300, serves as an ongoing and permanent registration for its holder, but is also transferable for a fraction of its original cost, an infinite number of times. The badge is metal and laser-etched, with a leather lanyard, and retained by the registrant for automatic entry into the event each year. The cost will increase over time as the convention grows, and there are multiple VIP benefits associated with the Infinity Membership. As part of the launch of this higher level of commitment for attendees, a fan investment opportunity was launched - the Infinity League - offering supporters one of six slots in an \\"elite\\" group who invest $1000 each for one year in the convention. They receive a complimentary Infinity Membership in return for their generosity, and in lieu of interest. Social Missions The event is billed as an opportunity for \\"enrichment through geekery,\\" promotion of literacy through the \\"geek arts,\\" supporting local maker culture, connecting creators to those aspiring to their craft, and connecting support for the local library's new media and \\"geeky\\" offerings. Another core value of the convention is to offer more substantial food in their consuite than many other events, to help offset attendance costs for fans in the community.

It was hosted by Chris Durham. It aired on the Food Network in 1998. Three contestants compete, each standing behind a blue, yellow, or pink mini- refrigerator, hoping to earn enough meal tickets to advance to Round 2, the Taste-Off Round, where the winner goes on to try to the grand prize. The Main Game =Round 1 (Meal Ticket)= In round one, three contestants face a game board called the \\"Meal Mixer\\". The Meal Mixer always contains four meals: \\"Breakfast\\", \\"Lunch\\", \\"Dinner\\" & \\"Snack\\". These act as categories. One additional spot, called \\"Pot Luck,\\" is also on the Meal Mixer. The first category is always selected by Chris (or in some cases whoever Chris acknowledges won the drawing of lots backstage); after that, a correct answer gives that player control of the Meal Mixer. The player in control presses a button to start the Meal Mixer, randomly selecting a category. A toss-up question is then read and the first player to buzz-in gets a chance to answer. Answering the question correctly takes control of the Meal Mixer, but an incorrect answer gives the other player(s) a chance to answer. Whoever gave the last correct answer always has control of the Meal Mixer. Whenever a player wins the round and advances to Round 2, Chris takes control of the Meal Mixer for the next question. The Meal Tickets The player with a correct answer not only takes control of the Meal Mixer but also puts up a meal ticket (corresponding to the category that the question came from) on his/her podium, hence the title. For example, a correct answer in the lunch category puts up a lunch meal ticket. Each meal ticket is represented by a food item: *Breakfast - egg *Lunch - hamburger *Dinner - turkey *Snack - bag of popcorn The object of the game is to get five meal tickets which include one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner, and two snacks. Note: If a contestant answers a question in a category from which he/she already has one breakfast, lunch, or dinner meal ticket, or two snack meal tickets, that player has a chance to steal a meal ticket from one of his/her opponents. However, if neither of the opponents has a meal ticket that the contestant doesn't have, that contestant gets a free unclaimed meal ticket of his/her choice, aka \\"stealing from the house.\\" Don't Play With Your Food Midway into round one (announced by a group of parental voices saying \\"Don't play with your food!\\"), all three contestants play a stunt that allows them to build or make things from food. The stunt lasts for 30, 45, or 60 seconds, and when time runs out, the results are judged. The player with the best performance (judged either by audience applause or by a quantitative measurement) gets a meal ticket of his/her choice & control of the Meal Mixer. If there's a tie, the players involved in a tie each get a meal ticket of their choice, but Chris takes control of the Meal Mixer. Potluck Potluck is always played one time per show. The contestant plays a solo stunt involving food. For example, the contestant may be given 20 seconds to load one pound of tea bags onto a scale, and must be within two ounces either way in order to win. If successful, the contestant earns a meal ticket of his/her choice. Winning the Round The first two players to get all five meal tickets, or, failing that, the two contestants with the most meal tickets when time is called (signified by a saxophone riff), win the round and advance to round two. If there's a tie for second place at the end of the round, a tie-breaker question is read to the players involved in the tie for advancement to round two. Regardless of the outcome, the third place player is eliminated, but wins parting gifts. =Round 2 (Taste-Off)= In round two (referred to on the air as \\"The Taste-Off Round\\"), the two remaining players face a dish that was made by a Food Network chef. Their job while going back & forth is to identify what ingredients are included in the dish. While identifying, they can take as much of that dish as they want. There are 9 or 11 ingredients, and the first player to identify a majority of the ingredients (5 or 6, respectively) wins the game. An incorrect ingredient or failure to respond in time gives the player a strike. Any player accumulating a total of three strikes is out of the game, and the other player wins, regardless of score. The winning player goes on to the bonus round, and the other player goes home with parting gifts. =Bonus Round (\\"Pressure Cooker\\")= The winning player plays a bonus round called \\"The Pressure Cooker Round\\". The giant pressure cooker onstage spins around to admit Chris and the contestant. To start, Chris shows 9 food words and phrases. Each one is part of a bigger list of foods and/or other things, all of them relate to specific subject. The contestant's job is to call out a word and the host reads off the list; the contestant can make as many guesses as he/she can, and if he/she gets stumped he/she can pass and move to the next list by calling out another word or wait until the list is complete. If the winning player gets six subjects correct in 60 seconds (sometimes 75 seconds), he/she wins a grand prize (usually a trip). But if he/she can not do that, he/she still wins a consolation prize. Notes After its first season, Pressure Cooker was reworked as a more serious food quiz program and retitled Taste Test. The new series was hosted by celebrity chef David Rosengarten and retained the middle game, in which contestants attempted to identify ingredients in a dish prepared by Food Network chefs. Glow in the Dark Productions was a NYC production company founded by creative staff members previously associated with the PBS game shows Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?. Both Pressure Cooker and Taste Test were produced by Shirley Abraham, Howard Blumenthal, Dana Calderwood, Charles Nordlander and Lynn Kestin Sessler. The buzz-in sound used in the main game was the same buzz-in sound from Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?.

She started in Marathi cinema. Her first Hindi film Nigahen Nafrat, was released in 1935. She is best remembered for her portrayal of Sita in Ram Rajya (1943). In 1997, she was honoured with the Filmfare Special Award for her contribution to arts.Bollywood501 Samarth later produced and directed a pair of movies that launched the careers of her daughters, Nutan and Tanuja. Early life Shobhana was born on 17 November 1916 in Bombay, British India, as Saroj Shilotri. An only child, her father Prabhakar Shilotri was a \\"pioneer banker\\" having started the Shilotri Bank in Bombay. Her mother Rattan Bai, in 1936, acted in the film Frontiers of Freedom, in Marathi (Swarajyachya Seemewar). Shobhna studied initially in Cathedral School, Bombay, for one year. In 1928, her father suffered financial losses and the business went into liquidation. The family then shifted to Bangalore in 1931, where Shobhana attended Baldwin Girls High School. To earn a living, her father gave private tuitions, while her mother taught in a Marathi school. In December that year, her father died of a heart attack and the mother and daughter returned to Bombay to stay with her maternal uncle. Shobhana studied in a convent school, but was unable to complete her matriculation as she had joined films by then. Her uncle was opposed to her joining films, and she and her mother moved out of his home (ironically his daughter and Shobhana's cousin Nalini Jaywant herself became an actress). Shobhana taught privately to make money. She met her future husband Kumarsen Samarth during this time, who had just returned from Germany and was keen on directing films. They got engaged and she started work on her first film. Career Shobana's first film was \\"Orphans Of Society\\" (1935), also called Nigahe Nafrat or Vilasi Ishwar for Kolhapur Cinetone, directed by Vinayak and starred Vinayak and Baburao Pendharkar. The film was not a success, but Shobhana was critically acclaimed for her role. The film was bilingual, made in Urdu and Marathi. Shobhana claims in an interview that she did not know any Urdu at that time of filming, speaking the dialogues by rote and it was only later that she picked up the language. She was with Kolhapur Cinetone for thirteen months, but acted in one film. She left Kolhapur Cinetone and joined Sagar Movietone (Sagar Film Company) and she acted in one film called Kokila (1937), directed by Sarvottam Badami, starring Motilal, Sabita Devi and Sitara Devi. The other film for Sagar was Do Diwane (1936), directed by C. M. Luhar and co-starring Motilal, Yakub and Aruna Devi. By the end of 1937, Shobhana left Sagar and joined General Films, acting in Industrial India (Nirala Hindustan), directed by Mohan Sinha with Prem Adib and Wasti. The second film for them was Pati Patni (1939) directed by V. M. Gunjal with co-stars Yakub, Sitara Devi and Wasti. By 1939, she had joined Hindustan Cinetone, making four films with them, which included Kaun Kisi ka (1939), Saubhagya (1940) by C. M. Luhar and Apni Nagariya (1940) by V. M. Gunjal. She then worked in a film directed by her husband, Kumar Sen Samarth, called Ghar Javai (1941), where she was cast with Damuanna Malvankar. In 1942 came her career-defining film Bharat Milap, directed by Vijay Bhatt and starring Durga Khote as Kaikeyi, Shobhana as Seeta and Prem Adib as Ram. Following this was Ram Rajya in 1943, and Shobhana became identified as Seeta, leading to several other films where they recreated the roles. Shobhana as Sita and Prem Adib as Rama became extremely popular and were accepted by the audiences and had them featuring as Rama and Sita on calendars. Personal life Shobhana was married to director and cinematographer Kumarsen Samarth from Vile Parle (E), Mumbai. They had three daughters, Nutan, Tanuja and Chatura and a son, Jaideep. Eventually, the couple parted amicably and Shobhana became linked to actor Motilal Rajvansh.Rediff On The Net Two of her daughters, Nutan and Tanuja, also became actresses. Shobhana produced their debut films. Her other daughter Chatura, is an artist and her son Jaideep is an advertising film producer. Chatura and Jaideep never acted in films. Nutan's son Mohnish Bahl is also an actor, as are Tanuja's daughters Kajol and Tanishaa Mukerji. Kajol is married to actor Ajay Devgan. Other members of the dynasty include Shomu Mukherjee, who married Tanuja. She and her daughter Nutan were estranged for more than two decades, but reconciled in the year 1983 before Nutan's death from cancer in February 1991. At her own death from cancer in 2000, Shobhana had seven granddaughters, one grandson, three great- granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.1st Filmfare Awards, 1953 Filmography =As Actress= *Vilasi Ishwar (1935) *Nigah-e-Nafrat (1935) *Do Diwane (1936) *Kokila (1937) *Pati Patni (1939) *Apni Nagariya (1940) *Savera (1942) *Vijay Lakshmi (1943) *Ram Rajya (1943) *Naukar (1943) *Mahasati Ansuya (1943) *Veer Kunal (1945) *Taramati (1945) *Shahkar (1947) *Sati Toral (1947) *Rambaan (1948) *Narasinha Avatar (1949) *Malika (1947) *Hamari Beti (1950) *Ram Janma (1951) *Insaniyat (1955) *Love in Simla (1960) *Chhalia (1960) *Chitralekha (1964) *Nai Umar Ki Nai Fasal (1965) *Wahan Ke Log (1967) *Ek Bar Mooskura Do (1972) *Do Chor (1972) *Panitheeratha Veedu (1973) *Ghar Dwaar (1985) =As Director= *Hamari Beti (1950) *Chhabili (1960) *Shaukar, produced and directed by S.

Ethan Bishop, the police officer in charge of the besieged Precinct 9, Division 13, in John Carpenter's Howard Hawks-inspired 1976 film, Assault on Precinct 13. This was one of the few heroic starring roles for a black actor in an action film of the 1970s outside of the blaxploitation genre. Stoker was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. He started his career on stage, including the 1954 Broadway production of Truman Capote's House of Flowers, where he met his future wife, Enid Mosier (acting name Vivian Bonnell). Prior to his role as Lt. Bishop, Stoker appeared in several blaxploitation films, often playing police detectives. Among these films were Abby (1974), Combat Cops (1974), and Sheba, Baby (1975), in which he played Pam Grier's love interest. Some of Stoker's other notable acting roles were in Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973), Horror High (1974), Airport 1975 (1974), Victory at Entebbe (1976), and the 1977 television mini-series 'Roots'.

Cook claims to have started his success when he was a taxi driver in the 1970s. His first book, Real Estate Money Machine, was originally self-published in 1981. He filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987. An updated version of his book was published in 1996. His company was liquidated in 2003 after it had been forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by creditors, and he served 88 months in prison for tax evasion. He still offers trading advice through his website and publications. Background In the 1990s, Cook was notorious for paid radio programs which he used to market investment seminars. He claimed he could teach people to double their money every 2.5 to 4 months. The government forced him to recant that claim. Cook is a proponent of rolling stocks (stocks that regularly vacillate between \\"predictable\\" highs and lows) and has been very vocal about stock splits being a good way to make money, claiming that many stocks rose post split (since the end of the 1990s bull market, Cook has not been as strong a proponent of this concept). One of his more famous phrases was meter drop. Cook said that as a cab driver he learned that money was made every time the meter dropped, and that it was better to take many small fares rather than one big one. This translated to Cook's short-term investment strategy of buying and selling many stocks for smaller, quicker profits rather than buying and holding securities for an extended period in the hope that they will increase greatly. He charged US$5,695 per person for \\"Wall Street Workshops\\" that were offered across the United States. In 2002, Cook's company, Wade Cook Financial Corporation (WCFC), filed for bankruptcy. The stock now trades on the pink sheets for around \\"a penny a share\\".http://www.pinksheets.com/quote/quote.jsp?symbol=WADCQ Since the bankruptcy of WCFC, Cook has kept a considerably lower profile, using the internet as his primary means of marketing. He has continued writing books and launched a multi-level investment program. Wade Cook is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has been known to use references to religion in his writings and presentations. Financial and legal troubles In 1987, Cook filed personal bankruptcy. Two companies he controlled, American Business Alliance and Monarch Funding Corporation, also went bankrupt that year. In 1989, Cook was charged with securities violations by the Arizona Corporation Commission. The following year, the Arizona Attorney General charged him with several criminal counts, including selling unregistered shares of a company he controlled. In 1998, Cook won a settlement against self-help guru Anthony Robbins over his claim that Robbins had illegally used concepts (particularly the \\"meter drop\\") from Cook's book Wall Street Money Machine to create a financial seminar. Robbins agreed that he had read the book and met with Cook, but disputed the illegality of his use of the concepts. A jury in Tacoma, Washington sided with Cook and awarded damages in the amount of US$655,900. In 2000, WCFC, a company which sold seminars on investing and offered subscriptions to a trading bulletin board service called the Wealth Information Network (W.I.N.), posted US$1.7 million in trading losses. The stated purpose of posting the bulletin board information about these trades was to let attendees of his financial workshops \\"learn from the master\\" by seeing what securities Wade Cook bought and sold. Gaining access to \\"Wade's Trades\\" was touted as one of the major advantages of attending these seminars. Subscribers to Wade's Trades could purchase the same securities that Wade Cook purchased and theoretically, could duplicate his results. The bulletin board often recommended the securities of obscure corporations or options in which there was a fairly small market. When Wade Cook's students began purchasing these investments, they tended to drive up the price. Initial purchasers could then liquidate their own positions in these investments at a profit, thus proving to Cook's students that he had a talent for picking securities that were poised to go up in value. Unfortunately, the increase in the value of the securities was often short-lived; since the price would be driven back down as students began to sell their positions. If most of the activity in the recommended securities was due to transactions by bulletin board subscribers, it is reasonable to conclude that at least some of these investment recommendations would become self-fulfilling prophesies. On October 5, 2000, Wade Cook Financial Corporation agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and 14 state Attorneys General on charges that the corporation misrepresented earnings potential. WCFC claimed 20% monthly returns. As a result, WCFC was required to set up redress program for consumers who purchased its products and to alter its advertised earnings claims. In 2002 the FTC brought new charges based on failure to comply with the previous order. In 2002, WCFC was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by a group of its creditors, including several employees and independent contractors, who claimed they had not been paid for several months. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Glover ordered the company liquidated on January 18, 2003, for failure to provide testimony creditors had requested. In December, 2005, Wade Cook and his wife Laura were charged with several counts of income tax evasion. Both pleaded not guilty. According to court documents, the Cooks operated a fraudulent charity, ostensibly to benefit the LDS Church, but instead bought show horses, his and her Cadillacs, a estate, and the majority share of an oil rig which gave Cook the right to name it. He named it after himself. The trial began on January 17, 2007. On February 20, 2007, Cook was found guilty by a federal jury of seven charges for failing to pay taxes on $8.9 million that the government says he should have reported as personal income from 1998 to 2000. His sentencing was set for June 22, 2007. On May 16, 2007 Laura Cook, the wife of Wade Cook, pled guilty to obstructing federal tax laws. She faced up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. On August 2, 2007, Wade was sentenced to 88 months in prison, his wife Laura Cook was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Wade was also ordered to pay back $3.75 million in owed back taxes. On September 4, 2008, Cook was taken into custody at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, Washington, preceding transfer to a prison where was to serve the remainder of his 88-month sentence. He was released from the Federal Satellite Prison Camp Sheridan in Sheridan, Oregon in April 2014 into the custody of the Pioneer Fellowship House in Seattle, Washington, and was released January 22, 2015, according to the federal prison system online search. After his release from prison, Wade began selling the same literature he was selling for years before being imprisoned.

The mouse is depicted at the base. The Walters Art Museum. Ganapatya is a denomination of Hinduism that worships Ganesha (also called Ganapati) as the Saguna Brahman.Ganapatyas Article from PHILTAR, Division of Religion and Philosophy, St Martin's College Beliefs The worship of Ganesha is considered complementary with the worship of other deities. Hindus of all sects begin prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies with an invocation of Ganesha, because of Ganesha's role as the god of beginnings. But although most Hindu sects do revere Ganesha, the Ganapatya sect goes further than that, and declares Ganesha to be the supreme being. Ganapatya is one of the five principal Hindu sects which focus on a particular deity, alongside Shaivism, focussed on Shiva, Shaktism, focussed on Shakti, Vaishnavism, focused on Vishnu, and Saura, focussed on Surya. While Ganapatya is not as large a sect as the other four, it still has been influential. There is also the Smartism sect, which follows Advaita philosophy and practices the \\"worship of the five forms\\" () system, popularized by . In this system, the five deities Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva, Devƒ´, and S≈´rya are viewed as five equal forms of one Saguna Brahman.Grimes, John A. Ganapati: Song of the Self. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) p. 162. History Ganapati has been worshipped as part of Shaivism since at least the fifth century. A specific Ganapatya sect probably began to appear between the sixth and ninth centuries: six sects are mentioned in the Sankara digvijaya (life of Adi Shankara) by Anandigiri. It reached a high point about the tenth century, and built temples dedicated to Ganesha, the largest of which is the Ucchi Pillayar Koil (the Columns Hall of a Thousand Pillars), on the Rock Fort of Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu. Ganesha is worshipped as the Supreme Being (Para Brahman) in this sect. Being the chief deity in this form of Hinduism, he is known by the epithet Parameshwara (Supreme God), which is normally reserved for Shiva. =Moraya Gosavi= Later, the sect was popularized by Morya Gosavi. According to one source, he found an idol of Ganapati not made by human hands, and built the Moragao temple near Pune in the 14th century. According to another, he experienced visions of Ganapati at the Morgaon shrine, and was entombed alive (jeeva samadhi) in 1651, in a Ganesha temple at his birthplace in Chinchwad. Article from BookRags.com Following him, the Ganapatya sect became prominent between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries in Maharashtra in south western India, centering on Cinchwad. Its centre is still among high-caste Hindus in the Marathi-speaking Maharashtra, and it is important in the rest of South India. Devotees hold an annual pilgrimage between Chinchwad and Moragao. Sect marks include a red circle on the forehead, or the brands of an elephant face and tusk on the shoulders.

I don't sing songs which hope people will die, but I couldn't help it with this one. The song is a sort of striking out... a feeling of what can you do?\\" Critic Andy Gill described the song as \\"the bluntest condemnation in Dylan's songbook, a torrent of plain speaking pitched at a level that even the objects of its bile might understand it.\\" Gill points out that when the song was published in Broadside magazine in February 1963, it was accompanied by drawings by Suze Rotolo, Dylan's girlfriend at the time, which depicted a man carving up the world with a knife and fork, while a hungry family forlornly looks on. According to Todd Harvey, in this song Dylan \\"allows the listener no opportunity to see the issue from the masters' eyes. 'I' and 'you' are clearly established and 'you' are clearly wrong. The repetitive text and accompaniment's droning single harmony work in tandem to drive home relentlessly the singer's perspective.\\" Harvey notes that Dylan transforms \\"Nottamun Town\\", which has absurdly nonsensical words (a naked drummer accompanies a royal procession \\"with his heels in his bosom\\") into a confrontational political song; Dylan's writing entered a new phase‚Äîharsh, and fitting with the times. On January 17, 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his farewell address from the Oval Office. In this speech, he warned that \\"we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\\" In an interview, published in USA Today on September 10, 2001 Dylan linked his song to Eisenhower's speech, saying: Other cultural references * American contemporary classical composer John Corigliano set the song's lyrics to music in his 2000 song cycle Mr. Tambourine Man.

Muiredach's High Cross is a high cross from the 10th or possibly 9th century, located at the ruined monastic site of Monasterboice, in County Louth, Ireland. There are two other high crosses at Monasterboice; in local terms Muiredach's cross is also known as the South Cross. Muiredach's cross is the most impressive surviving example of early medieval Irish stonework, and the crosses at Monasterboice have been said to be Ireland's greatest contribution to European sculpture. Recently concerns have been raised over the condition of Muiredach's cross; and it has been suggested that the cross should possibly be brought indoors to protect it from the elements. Background: high crosses in Ireland Location of high crosses in Ireland. Irish high crosses are internationally recognised icons of early medieval Ireland. They are usually found on early church sites and can be either plain or decorated. High crosses served a variety of functions including, liturgical, ceremonial, and symbolic uses. They were also used as markers for an area of sanctuary around a church; as well as focal points for markets, which grew around church sites. The \\"greatest\\", or \\"classic\\", Irish high crosses can be found at Durrow Abbey, the Abbey of Kells, and at Monasterboice. These high crosses are decorated with panels inscribed with biblical themes; and are thought to be influenced from late antiquity and early medieval Rome. Such 'classic' high crosses comprise the largest corpus of biblical sculpture in all of Europe, in the last quarter of the first millennium CE. The sculpted panels are thought to have been originally painted, though no traces of paint survive today. On such high crosses, the east face tends to show scenes from the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation; while the west face shows scenes from the New Testament. High crosses can be dated from the inscriptions they bear; and it is difficult to date the majority of the plain and undecorated high crosses. The earliest Irish high crosses, at Kinnity, County Offaly, have been dated to 846‚Äì862 CE. Both Muiredach's cross and the Cross of the Scriptures at Clonmacnoise have been dated to about 900‚Äì920 CE. High crosses are thought to have originated as stone versions of decorated wooden or metal crosses; and the stone crosses which survive today are considered to be the last phase of development of the high cross. Early forms are thought to have been made of wood, with ornamented panels of bronze sheeting; and would have been much smaller than the grand high crosses which survive today. Irish high crosses are considered to have been derived from stone crosses in Britain, where they became popular in the 8th century. Ruinous Monasterboice today. Pictured is a round tower, church ruins and one of the site's three early mediaeval high crosses. Muiredach's High Cross is one of three surviving high crosses located at Monasterboice (Gaeilge: Mainistir Bhuithe, \\"Buithe's monastery\\"). The monastic site is said to be founded in the 6th century, by St Buithe. It is most famous for its 9th and 10th century high crosses‚Äîmost notably Muiredach's High Cross. These crosses are all made of sandstone and are referred to as the North, West, and South Crosses. It is not certain whether they stand in their original locations. The South Cross is commonly known as Muiredach's cross because of an inscription on the bottom of the west-face. The inscription reads √ìR DO MUIREDACH LAS NDERNAD IN CHROS, which translates from Gaeilge as \\"a prayer for Muiredach who had this cross made\\". It is thought that this Muiredach is likely Muiredach mac Domhnall (died 923), who was one of the monastery's most celebrated abbots; he was also the abbot-elect of Armagh and also the steward of the southern U√≠ N√©ill. There is, however, another abbot named Muiredach who died in 844. Another possibility is that Muiredach may refer to Muiredach mac Cathail (died 867); a king whose territory included the site of the monastery. The cross measures about high; including the base, which measures . The cross is made of sandstone which is yellow in colour. The main shaft of the cross is carved from a single block of sandstone; the base and the capstone on the top are carved from separate stones. The base is the shape of a truncated pyramid of four sides. It measures high and at the bottom; it tapers to by at the top. The main shaft is rectangular, measuring high; by at the bottom. tapering to by at the top. The topmost stone, or capstone, is carved in the shape of a house, with a sloping roof; and has a crescent-shaped finial at each end. It is thought that such house-shaped capstones may represent reliquaries, which, like the Monymusk Reliquary, typically took this form in Irish Christianity. Every piece of the cross is divided into panels which are decorated with carvings. The carvings are remarkably well preserved, however, they certainly would have originally had much finer detail. Even so, certain details about clothing, weapons, and other things, can still be clearly made out. Biblical themes dominate the carved panels; though there are pieces which feature certain geometric shapes and interlace ornaments. 20th century Irish archaeologist Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister noted that there are 124 figures sculpted upon the panels of the cross‚Äî119 of which shown in some form of costume. The cross is not unlike other works of Insular art where the artist has represented people in contemporary costume. All, except one, of the figures is depicted bare-headed. The lone figure with headgear is Goliath, who wears a conical helmet. Generally the hair is worn clipped in a straight line over the forehead, though in some cases it is shown to be distinctly curly. Many of the figures have no facial hair, though several of them wear very long moustaches, with heavy ends which hang down to the level of the chin. There are very few beards represented; those shown with beards are Adam, Cain, Moses and Saul. Macalister considered that the artist excelled in the geometric and abstract patterns which appear on the cross. On the ring surrounding the head of the cross, there are 17 different patterns. Macalister stated that geometric patterns fall into three categories: spiral, interlace, and key- patterns. =Concerns over the conservation of the Cross= Recently there have been concerns raised over the safety and protection of the cross. In 2004 Barry McGahon, chairperson of the Monasterboice Tour Guides, stated to an Irish newspaper that it was not well protected; and suggested that a railing around the cross would temporally keep people from interfering with it. McGahon stated that the cross had begun to take longer drying out and that it seemed like rain was seeping into it. He added that acid rain and pollution from a newly opened M1 motorway would have adverse effects upon the cross. In 2008, Peter Harbison, professor of archaeology, advised that they should be brought indoors to protect them from the elements. He stated that if they were not so-protected they would continue to decay‚Äîas sandstone decomposes easily. =Proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site= In about 2008 Harbison stated that the crosses at Monasterboice could probably be regarded as Ireland's greatest contribution to European sculpture. In April 2009 The Irish Times reported that the Government of Ireland was about to submit a list of sites‚Äîamong them Monasterboice‚Äîto UNESCO to be considered a World Heritage Site. Description of panels =East face= *Panel 1. This panel depicts two hermit saints‚ÄîAnthony and Paul of Thebes‚Äîholding a loaf of bread, with a raven sitting on the ground beside them. This panel is related to panel 1 on the north face, which shows Anthony and Paul meeting. *Panel 6. It is uncertain what this panel represents. J. Romilly Allen proposed that this panel may represent a soul being carried to heaven by two angels. Macalister thought it possible that the panel represented the Recording angel. *Panel 7. This panel represents The Last Judgement. It contains more than 45 figures; in the centre, Jesus is standing, holding a floriated sceptre in the right hand and the Cross of the Resurrection in the left. On the head of Christ there is a bird‚Äîpossibly a phoenix, the symbol of the Resurrection. At the foot of Christ is a small, kneeling figure with an open book over the head. Macalister considered that this likely represents an angel with the Book of Life. On the right of Christ is David enthroned, playing a harp, upon which the Holy Spirit rests in the form of a dove; behind are a choir of angels playing instruments. On the left of Christ are the Lost Souls, being driven away from Christ by a devilish creature holding a trident. *Panel 8. This panel shows three figures: Michael, the Devil, and a human. Michael is shown weighing the soul of a human in a balance. The balance is suspended by a chain upon a cross-bar above. The Devil is lying prostrated below, while attempting to pull down the empty scale of the balance to influence it in his favour. Michael also holds a staff and is thrusting it into the Devil's head. Macalister stated that this scene is not recorded on any other Irish high cross. *Panel 9. This panel represents the Adoration of the Magi. Usually the Magi are represented as three, because of their three gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. However, in some cases, likely for symmetry's sake, they are also depicted in a group of four‚Äîas in this panel, being led by a long-bearded and aged Saint Joseph the Betrothed.http://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/muiredach/muirdacheast.html Over the head of Christ is the Star of Bethlehem. *Panel 10. This panel depicts Moses drawing water from the rock. Moses is depicted standing with a staff, in front of a crowd of thirsty Israelites, while water is gushing forth from a hole. The two rows of Israelites are likely meant to show people standing next to each other; and this is another example of the trouble of perspective in such carvings. The scene is chosen for its New Testament typological application, as Christ is the spiritual rock, the source of the living water. The scene is not infrequently used in catacombs and other places where early Christian art is found; but it is very rare in Insular art. *Panel 11. This panel depicts the battle between David and Goliath. The two combatants stand in the middle of the panel are likely meant to be in the foreground; there is figure on either side of the combatants which are likely meant to be seen as in the background. David has a shepherd's crook over one shoulder, and in the other hand he holds a sling, hanging open to show that the stone has already been cast. Over his shoulder is suspended a wallet in which the stones were stored. Goliath is depicted on his knees, with a hand against his forehead, to indicate that he has been struck there. He wears a conical helmet; being the only one character depicted on the cross to wear any kind of head-covering. He bears a round shield and a short dagger. To the left of the two combatants is a seated figure, likely King Saul, who also has a round shield and carries a short sword, and is drinking from a horn. The fourth figure, to the right of the combatants, is according to Macalister, likely Jonathan, though this figure may also represent Goliath's armourer. *Panel 12. This is a double panel, which contains two scenes. The left scene depicts Adam and Eve, standing under the forbidden tree, which is heavily laden with fruit. Coiled around the tree is the serpent, which is whispering into the ear of Eve, who is handing the apple to Adam. According to Macalister, this is one of the most common scenes sculpted on high crosses (however it is not carved on the tallest cross at Monasterboice). This scene gives an explanation of how sin entered the world; the next scene shows the first murder. The scene on the right depicts Cain and Abel. Cain is represented as a middle-aged man with a beard, who grasps Abel, pictured as a beardless youth, and buries a cleaver into his head. *Panel 13. This panel shows two animals playing with each other; Macalister thought they were possibly lions. Panels A and B These panels appear on the under-side of the cross. *Panel B. This panel is located on the under-side of one of the arms of the cross. It shows a hand surrounded by conventionalised clouds. This panel represents the Hand of God, or Dextra Dei, which has long been used as a Christian symbol. With very few exceptions, it was not until about the 12th century that artists presumed to make a full human likeness of God. Before this time the normal way of representing God was showing a hand issuing from the clouds. According to Macalister this scene has no connection with any of the others sculpted on the cross. He considered that since it appears on the under-side, where a bystanders can see the hand above their head, that the Hand of God was outstretched towards the bystander. The Red Hand of Ulster may be based upon a mythological motif; however, it may also be based upon the Dextra Dei. =West face= *Panel 1a. The panel depicts Moses on Mount Sinai, with Aaron and Hur supporting his hands. *Panel 11. This panel depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. The central figure is Christ upon the cross. He is fully clothed, which is normal in European representations of the Crucifixion at this date. His arms are stretched straight and horizontal. The lance-bearer and sponge-bearer are placed symmetrically on either side of Christ. MacAlister thought that the two circular knobs appearing between them and Christ probably represent the sun and moon, referring to the darkness at the Crucifixion. MacAlister stated that it was uncertain what the bird at the foot of the cross represented. He stated that some thought it is a symbol of the resurrection, and that others thought it represents the dove of peace. There is a similar bird above the Crucifixion on the high cross at Kells. On the outside of the lance-bearer and sponge-bearer are two small figures‚Äîa woman, and a man kneeling on one knee, probably representing the Virgin Mary and John. *Panel 13. MacAlister thought that this panel probably represented the parting commission of the ascending Christ to his Apostles. The central figure (Christ) is seated; a footstool shaped like an animal's head appears between his feet. He hands a roll to the figure on the left; he hands a book to the figure on the right. MacAlister stated that this figure on the right is John, as his symbol of an eagle (likely an eagle) is shown above his head. *Panel 14. This panel features three figures. The middle figure has his hand raised in benediction. The figure on the left is stretching out his finger and touching the side of the central figure. MacAlister considered this panel to represent the Incredulity of Thomas (\\"Doubting Thomas\\"), which is now the general view; if this is so, it would be quite unique on Irish crosses, though the scene is often found in other Early Medieval Christian art. *Panel 15. This panel shows three men; it is thought to represent the seizure of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane. The panel shows Christ, in the middle, holding a staff and being arrested by two men with military equipment. A similar representation of this scene is also pictured on the Cross of King Flann at Clonmacnois. *Panels A and B. See east face section for detailed description. =North face= *Panel 5. It is uncertain what this panel is supposed to represent. The panels shows three angels, a seated figure holding something unintelligible, and two other figures, one of which appears to be un-draped, holding rods. MacAlister proposed that this panel may represent the Scourging of Christ, but he was not satisfied with his guess. =South face= *Panel 1. This panel shows a horseman, and above a much badly weathered pattern of spirals which are hard to make out. Macalister proposed that this panel could represent one of the mystic riders described in the Book of Revelation. *Panel 5. This panel depicts Pilate washing his hands. The Gospel of Matthew states that before condemning Jesus to death, Pilate washed his hands with water in front of the crowd, saying, \\"I am innocent of this man's blood; you will see.\\" *Panel 9. This panel shows a coiling plant; in six of the coils there is an animal kicking up its hind legs. The hind legs of the middle two animals entwine to be part of a fretwork in the middle of the panel. At the top of the panel are two birds feeding. Sources ;Footnotes ;References * Facsimile reprint. Originally published in 1887 in London, by Whiting & Co.

Historically part of Glamorgan, Ton Pentre, a former industrial coal mining village, is a district of the community of Pentre. The old district of Ystradyfodwg was named after the church at Ton Pentre. Ton Pentre is, perhaps, best known for an event in 1924, when the Duke of York (later George VI of the United Kingdom) played a round of golf with Trade Unionist Frank Hodges.  Early and industrial history  One of the earliest recorded settlements in Ton Pentre is an Iron Age hillfort located at Maindy Camp. Although initially believed to have been from the Bronze Age, the camp was misidentified due to items from a Bronze Age cairn that were found inside the camp perimeter.Davis, Paul R. Historic Rhondda, An Archaeological and Topographical Survey 8000 BC - AD 1850, Hackman: Ynyshir (1989) pg. 14 The area on which Ton Pentre now stands was originally the site of a cluster of platform houses or hafodi; small farming buildings, occupied only during the summer months. The site was later settled by a farm and a few cottages, known as 'Y Ton' ('meadow') the site was owned by absentee landlord Crawshay Bailey. To distinguish the area from nearby Tonypandy, it became known as Ton Pentre. When it became viable to mine anthracite coal in deep shaft pits in the mid-19th century, many pits were sunk in the Rhondda valley, one of which was located in Ton Pentre - the Maindy Colliery. It was the individual collieries that were at the heart of the separate 'villages' that emerged on the valley floor as they were the major employers in the area. At the height of the mining industry, Ton Pentre was home to a few thousand people living in high- density terraced houses that spanned the whole valley. =David Davies and his last half crown= The largest colliery in the area, Maindy Colliery, was established in Ton Pentre when the first mine was sunk by David Davies & Partners in 1864. Davies had rented land in the Rhondda Fawr and had searched for a workable seam for 15 months. When he had finally run out of money he gathered his workforce together and paid them their final wages. Digging his hand into his pocket he took out a single half crown saying, \\"There you are. That's all I've got\\". Someone in the crowd replied, \\"'We'll have that as well\\" and Davies impulsively threw his last coin into the crowd. Impressed by this gesture, the men agreed to continue working for another seven days without pay. On the seventh day of digging with no pay, a massive seam of the best- quality steam coal was finally found.\\"The Story of Wales: Half crown 'gamble' behind David Davies' coal empire\\" at bbc.co.uk The mine was near closure in 1866 when the new Six Feet seam was discovered. This sustained production of coal until 1948, when mining ceased at the colliery, though it remained open as a ventilation shaft for other mines.  Present day Ton Pentre  The village itself has seen a marked decline in commerce and industry associated with the area since the demise of the coal industry. This has also been a contributory factor in the social deprivation that has stricken the area and leaves the South Wales Valleys with high unemployment. However, recent regeneration is changing the fortunes of the area. The influence of the M4 corridor and the economic boom in Cardiff has meant that the Rhondda valleys are increasingly becoming commuter zones for the Cardiff and Swansea districts. Notable buildings and structures Bethesda Chapel in 2008 Ton Pentre Workingmen's Hall and Institute is a Grade II listed building,The Theatres Trust once a miners' institute but now a cinema called the Phoenix. The original building was constructed in 1895 next to the Crawshay Bailey Estate Office on Church Road.Rhondda Cynon Taff Library Services Heritage Trail The Institute was built from subscriptions from the Maindy and Eastern collieries, and originally the Institute took the name of both pits. The building consisted of a library, news room, refreshment room and committee room, along with other functional areas. A theatre hall was added to the institute in 1904 designed by architect Jacob Hall. In 1908 the hall was rented out to a private company for showing early silent movies. In 1931 the hall was upgraded to allow the playing of talkies, and continued as a cinema until 1971, when it became a bingo hall. It was closed in 1989 and was derelict for two years until it reopened as 'The Phoenix' in 1991. Bethesda Chapel on Pryce Street, was a Congregationalist chapel built in 1877 and rebuilt and enlarged in 1906.New York Times from an original transcript from Hywel Davies for the BBC The impressive building once seated over 1,000 people but by 1988 the congregation had fallen to 11.

He is known in Pakistan as the hero of Rann of Kutch, as he was a brigadier in command of 6 Brigade, during the fighting in April 1965 prior to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. He was killed in a helicopter crash, in Kashmir, during the Battle of Chamb while in command of 23 Infantry Division during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. Till date, he remains the only General of Pakistan army to die in combat. 1965 War In April 1965, as part of a tri-service exercise (Arrow Head), the Indians brought in 31 and 67 Infantry Brigades in area Karim Shahi - Kavda. The IAF and the Indian aircraft carrier , supported by other naval vessels, also moved into the gulf. On 8/9 April, in a series of events not entirely clear, clashes broke out between the Indians and the Pakistanis at a post near Ding, Rann of Kutch.On 23 April Brigadier Iftikhar Janjua ordered the 4 Punjab to capture point 84 by first activity around Chad Bet. Since the progress of 6 Punjab was slow 2 Frontier Force (FF) was directed to join them. By first light, the battalion reached its objective without suffering too many casualties. 2 FF later attacked Biar Bet along with a squadron of 12 Cavalry.

Ahmad, 1985 pg.20-21 The outcome of the Rann of Kutch was considered as a positive for the Pakistan Army. As described by Lt General Gul Hassan Khan, then Director of Military Operations, in his later memoirs - \\"the set back in Kutch proved immeasurably disconcerting to the Indian army. As a result, the Government of India was in a quandary. On the other hand, ours was in a state of euphoria. The high command of our army was intoxicated by our showing and our morale could not possibly have been higher. We were ready for any task that may be assigned to us without any question.\\".Quoted by Altaf Gauhar in 1965 War: Boomerang (possibly from The Nation, September 24, 1999) retrieved from Pakistan Link website July 26, 2006 The restraint shown by India would later convince Field Marshal Ayub Khan that the Indian Government was in no mood to fight. This encouraged them into launching the Kashmir offensive, which led to the War in September 1965.

He spared himself the time to learn about the nuances of armoured fighting vehicles and their operations. Soon after, Janjua would command 23 Division based at Jhelum. 1971 War In the 1971 War, Janjua was divisional commander of 23 Infantry Division. He was assigned the task of capturing Chhamb, a strategically important town in Kashmir, which would turn out to be the only decisive victory for Pakistan on the Kashmir front of 1971. The fighting around Chhamb was intensely fierce and took toll on both the advancing Pakistani troops and the fiercely resisting Indian regiments. Although Janjua was advised by high command to try to take Chhamb from the south, Janjua said it was a better to take Mandiala bridge his troops would outflank the Indians eventually forcing them out of Chhamb and all the area west of Tawa. After intense fighting Mandiawala was captured, then Pallanwala and Chak Pandit, and on 9 December 1971, the first Pakistani troops entered the surrounding area around Chhamb under the personal supervision of Janjua. In the middle of fighting around Chhamb proper, on 9 December 1971, Janjua was killed when his OH-13S (Sioux) light helicopter, in which he was travelling on to coordinate and position his troops, was attacked.News article in Jang His helicopter was shot down by an Indian shoulder-mounted weapon. He was badly burned and was evacuated to Combined Military Hospital Kharian Cantt. Iftikhar Khan Janjua Road is named after him in Rawalpindi, Cannt. Iftikhar Janjua was a brilliant and charismatic leader who inspired his troops to continue to fight. It was leading from the front for which General Iftikhar Janjua is remembered even today by the troops who served in 23 Division during the Battle of Chhamb. It was this quality which enabled him to arrive at a realistic appraisal of the actual situation without undue reliance on exaggerated reports from lower echelons and successfully take Chhamb. Personal life Major General Iftikhar Janjua was known for his boldness and for the confidence he inspired among his men by being in the front lines during the heat of the battle. He was a Janjua Rajput, a tribe known for its Martial Reputation and royal ancestry. His father Raja Mehmood Amjad was a barrister and the family was settled in Sargodha District. He is brother of Major General Ijaz Amjad, another outstanding general.http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/general.html Further reading * John H.

Dinas is often referred to as Dinas Rhondda to avoid confusion with Dinas Powys in the Vale of Glamorgan. The word ' in Modern Welsh means \\"city\\", but here (as in Old and Middle Welsh more generally) it means \\"hill fort\\". Location Dinas is located in the lower Rhondda Valley about half way between Treorchy and Pontypridd. Neighbouring settlements are Penygraig, Trealaw, Tonypandy, Cymmer and Porth. The colliery Dinas is the site of Dinas Lower () Colliery, sunk by Walter Coffin in 1812 as the first deep coal mine in the Rhondda valley. This was later followed by the sinking of the Dinas Middle Colliery in 1832 along the southern banks of the river Rhondda Fawr, opposite Dinas Rhondda railway station. From here coal was carried by trams via Porth, Cymmer, and Trehafod to Pontypridd, where it was conveyed by canal to Cardiff. In 1844 there was an explosion in the mine, the first major explosion to occur in the Rhondda Valleys, and twelve men and boys were killed. In 1869, a new shaft was opened in order to improve conditions in the pit. Ten years later another devastating explosion resulted in the death of 63 miners. The shaft was deepened in 1881 to reach lower seams with steam coal, but by 1887 production was declining and in 1893 production had ceased in both collieries. In 1841 the 4-mile long Rhondda branch line of the Taff Vale Railway was opened between Pontypridd and Dinas, eventually to be extended as far as Treherbert by 1856.

A former coalmining community, the village is now the site of the Rhondda Heritage Park, a tourist attraction commemorating the Rhondda valley coalmining industry. Spelling variants found in the past are Trehavod (an English spelling, using \\"v\\" instead of \\"f\\") and Trefhafod (a hypercorrect Welsh form, using the conservative literary form \\"tref\\" instead of the colloquial, and more modern literary form, \\"tre\\").  History  The Lewis Merthyr Colliery now part of the Rhondda Heritage Park The 1847 tithe map of the area shows a number of farms on the area that was to become Trehafod; these were named, Hafod Uchaf, Hafod Ganol and Hafod Fawr. It was from these farms that Trehafod was to take its name. \\"Hafod\\" is a Welsh word meaning literally \\"summer dwelling\\", and refers to an upland farm (from the practice of taking cattle up the hillside from the valley floor to graze in the summer months) (haf = summer, bod = dwelling, with soft mutation of [b] to [v] of the second element (bod) after a noun used as an adjective equivalent in attributive position (haf)). Tre (literally ‚Äútown‚Äù) was used in the eighteen-hundreds in industrial areas for a street or streets of workers‚Äô housing (equivalent to English ‚Äútown‚Äù or ‚Äúville‚Äù, similarly used). Trehafod railway station lies on the Rhondda Line which follows the River Rhondda. The railway line and river border the village on either side. Trehafod is now most famous for the Rhondda Heritage Park which was once the Lewis Merthyr colliery, at the peak time for coal mining production, one of the most productive collieries in the South Wales Coalfield. =Flooding= The village has frequently suffered flooding from the river, the most serious of which in 1960 claimed the life of an Afon street resident. (Afon is Welsh for 'river'.) Flooding also occurred in 1921, 1929 and 1979, after which the Rhondda River bank was reinforced. \\"The 1979 flood overtopped the banks of the River Rhondda just down river from Trehafod and floodwaters entered the low-lying areas of Colliery Street and Great Street causing flooding to many properties.
