The doctrine of the lesser magistrate is a concept in Protestant thought. A lesser magistrate is a ruler such as a prince who is under a greater ruler such as an emperor. The doctrine of the lesser magistrate is a legal system explaining the exact circumstances that a lesser magistrate has the right and responsibility to resist the greater ruler. The doctrine of the lesser magistrate is dependent on the private citizen argument from prior to the Reformation, which stated that any evil done by an officeholder is committed as a private citizen, rather than by the office.Whitford, David, Tyranny and Resistance: The Magdeburg Confession and the Lutheran Tradition, 2001, 144 pages A related example in the United States is the procedure in which the President can be removed by lesser figures in the national government.Such as the members of his cabinet under Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, be impeached and convicted by members of the legislature for High crimes and misdemeanors, and be replaced under the United States presidential line of succession. However, in the original sense the use of the doctrine of the lesser magistrates carried with it the possibility of violence and war. Reformation The doctrine of the lesser magistrate was first popularized in a simpler form by John Calvin, who wrote that private Christians must submit to the ruling authorities, but there may be \\"popular magistrates\\" who have \\"been appointed to curb the tyranny of kings\\". When these magistrates \\"connive at kings when they tyrannise and insult over the humbler of the people\\" they \\"fraudulently betray the liberty of the people\\" when God has appointed them guardians of that liberty.John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, IV.xx.31. A more elaborate doctrine of the lesser magistrate was first employed in the Lutheran Magdeburg Confession of 1550, which argued that the \\"subordinate powers\\" in a state, faced with the situation where the \\"supreme power\\" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist. This work drew heavily on Luther, including his Beerwolf concept as one of multiple conditions an evil ruler would need to fulfill before opposition to his rule could be justified. In other words, even though an evil ruler is acting as a private citizen, he still may not be resisted unless all of the other conditions are fulfilled. One of them was that the evil ruler must show himself to be a true Beerwolf and servant of the devil. Variations on this doctrine of the lesser magistrate were commonly taught by orthodox Calvinists such as Theodore Beza. The doctrine of the lesser magistrate became important for the justification of the Dutch Revolt. According to Johannes Althusius in 1603 work, Politica, resistance to a supreme magistrate by lesser magistrates is justified in the case of tyranny. Althusius argued that the provincial authorities of the United Provinces were in this situation.R. von Friedeburg, \\"Althusius,\\" in Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Dutch Philosophers, ed. W. van Bunge (Bristol, 2003), 11‚Äì18. Gary M. Simpson suggests that after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572 there was a \\"populist expansion\\" of the doctrine in which \\"the ruled would no longer be merely the subject of the ruler; they would become citizens.\\"Gary M. Simpson, \\"Toward a Lutheran \\"Delight in the Law of the Lord\\": Church and State in the Context of Civil Society,\\" in Church & State: Lutheran Perspectives, p. 43. Both the private citizen argument and the doctrine of the lesser magistrates were used in the United States Declaration of Independence to justify resistance by lesser leaders who in all other cases would be bound to submit to the top executive. Like Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, George III sent an army to terrorize his own subjects, fulfilling the Beerwolf clause.Kelly OConnell of Canada Free Press, August 4, 2014, parts II. Magdeburg Confession and III. Doctrine of Lesser Magistrates Presumed obsolescence of the concept Following the spread of Hegelianism, the doctrine of the lesser magistrate became less important. This is because in Hegel's thought, authority within a society could bleed in at all levels, not just from the top executive down through a hierarchy, even though the philosopher noted that in matters of national importance, there must be a top executive to decide. However, there have been numerous instances in recent years of lesser magistrates (e.g., county clerks, sheriffs, etc.) acting or refusing to act in cases where the law either would have abridged the rights of citizens, or forced citizens into acts that would violate their rights or freedom of conscience, even when facing personal penalties for doing so.p.4 of Hegel on Sovereignty and Monarchy, Philip J. Kain, 2015 Also significant was that the power of the rational monarch in Hegel's thought was absolute.p.17 of Hegel on Sovereignty and Mon archy Philip J. Kain, 2015 On the other hand, irrational governments are naturally weak and can be subverted, and in time history will show which party was right.Hegel: \\"Where there is no judge on earth, the appeal lies to God in Heaven.\\" quoted in Hegel and the Freedom of Moderns By Domenico Losurdo, Duke University Press, 2004.

Read here Origins and early training Charles was the son of an Irish Roman Catholic tailor, whose home and business moved from Rotherhithe to Lincoln's Inn Fields during the boy's childhood. He became a chorister in the Sardinian Embassy Chapel in Duke Street, where he was taken on as a vocal pupil by Samuel Webbe, the organist. The boy had plans to enter the church, but was apprenticed by his father to a carver-gilder, with whom, however, he soon fell out, and after some months he articled himself to Thomas Linley the elder, the composer and singing master.'Mr. Charles Dignum (with a Portrait)', The European Magazine and London Review December 1798, pp. 362 (portrait) to 364.

This obituary is largely dependent on the article in the London Review for 1798, cited above. Read here. His next role was Cymon in Michael Arne's opera. In a busy first year he was well- received, appearing in various roles, and made his place alongside many well- established performers.

His career progressed, principally at Drury Lane, in musical theatre (mainly ballad opera) and pantomime, in lesser roles in Shakespearean theatre. He remained a popular choice in ballad recitals, singing much at Ranelagh Gardens and in taverns: in the summer seasons he continued singing at Vauxhall Gardens until at least 1810.

The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe, Naomi Watts, Katie Aselton and Jordan Gavaris. The film is about an American man who attempts suicide in Mount Fuji's \\"Suicide Forest\\" where he meets a Japanese man who is there for the same reason. Principal photography began on July 28, 2014, in Foxborough, Massachusetts; the production moved to Japan in September of the same year. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. The film was released on August 26, 2016, by A24. It received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing mere $825,577 on a $25 million budget. Plot An American man, Arthur Brennan (Matthew McConaughey), travels to the \\"Suicide Forest\\" (Aokigahara forest) to kill himself at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, the site of numerous suicides. There he encounters a Japanese man, Takumi Nakamura (Ken Watanabe), who wants to kill himself as well, and both men begin a journey of self-reflection and survival. It is revealed through flashbacks that Arthur wants to end his life by drug overdose after his wife, Joan, (Naomi Watts) died. As he is about to take a third pill he hears Takumi struggling. Takumi had slit his wrists for being dishonored at work but misses his wife and child and decides he does not want to die. He tried to escape the dense sea of trees but cannot find the trail back. Arthur decides to help him but also ends up disoriented in the forest. They survive falls, flash floods and hypothermia as they try to escape the forest and along the way find others who succeeded in ending their lives. They share their stories together and it is revealed that Arthur is there because of his guilt of how he and his wife treated each other in their marriage. After she becomes sick they rekindle their love and reminisce about a favorite place of hers where she would spend hours amongst the orchids. He says he will take her back there when she is ready to. The doctor tells them she will survive and she is transported by ambulance to a recovery hospital. He follows behind her in his car, talking to her on the phone and jokes with her about not knowing what her favorite color or season is. Before she responds a truck plows into the ambulance killing her. At her funeral he tells the director he did not really know her even after all the years they were married. He says he overheard her sisters talking and one of them sent her a copy of her favorite book. This is the package Arthur brings with him into the forest. After a night of talking Arthur separates from Takumi in the morning to try to get help. He found a walkie-talkie from a deceased camper and Takumi is too unwell. He promises him that he will come back. The park rangers catch Arthur's calls and he dramatically makes his way to help but is too weak to let them know that there is another person in the forest. Almost two weeks later Arthur is being evaluated by a psychiatrist before his release and he says he will go back to the forest to find Takumi even though the rangers could not. They found the tent he spoke of but did not find anyone there. The psychiatrist also reveals that there is no one by the name of Takumi Nakamura who has a wife and daughter by those names. There is a camera at the entrance of the forest and Arthur was seen going in and coming out but no one else was seen going in. Arthur returns to the forest and makes his own trail with string and later crumpled paper to mark his way back. He finds the package he left in the forest and also the tent and the coat he covered over Takumi but there is no Takumi. He takes away the coat and under it is a beautiful orchid. He remembers what Takumi said about the forest. He believed it is a form of purgatory and that the spirit of your loved ones go there and are closest during your darkest moments. He opens the package holding her favorite book and it is a copy of Hansel and Gretel. Arthur realizes it was Joan's spirit that helped him find his way out and is helping him heal his guilt to go on without her. Arthur returns to America and brings the orchid with him. While helping a student it is revealed that the names of Takumi's wife and daughter are not names but words that mean yellow and winter. He remembers the last conversation he had with his wife about her favorite color and season. The last scene is Arthur planting the orchid in the garden of Joan's favorite place. Cast *Matthew McConaughey as Arthur Brennan, Joan‚Äôs husband *Ken Watanabe as Takumi Nakamura *Naomi Watts as Joan Brennan, Arthur‚Äôs wife *Katie Aselton as Gabriella Laforte, a woman who has an affair to Arthur. *Jordan Gavaris as Eric Production The project was first announced in December 2013. Matthew McConaughey joined the cast in February 2014 with Naomi Watts joining in May of that year The film's international distribution was sold to different companies at 2014 Cannes Film Festival, which includes Entertainment One to handle the rights for UK, Australia and New Zealand, and Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions to handle for Eastern Europe, Pan-Latin America and Scandinavia. On August 15, Katie Aselton joined the cast to play a woman who has an affair with McConaughey's character. =Filming= On May 15, 2014, McConaughey and director Van Sant talked about the upcoming film which was officially slated to start on July 15, Van Sant said, \\"My latest feelings is to try to shoot in Japan, if it's too difficult, we would probably go to the northwest in the States, where the land is very similar.\\" The film's budget was set at $25 million with McConaughey receiving a $3.5 million salary. The principal photography of the film began on July 28, 2014, in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The crews were filming deep in the woods in the Purgatory Chasm, Sutton, Massachusetts, where they were also using the recreation hall and chapel at Cocasset River Recreation Area, which they scheduled to rent again on August 14. Publicist Gregg Brilliant said, \\"The film makers looked at about half a dozen places around the country. The story takes place in Japan and the Northeast United States, and we chose Massachusetts. It's a beautiful location.\\" Shooting began in Massachusetts through September, after which filming moved to Japan. The filming wrapped-up on September 30, 2014, in Massachusetts and Japan, with post-production beginning in Los Angeles. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2015. Prior to, Roadside Attractions and Lionsgate acquired U.S distribution rights to the film. A24 later acquired distribution rights, after Roadside and Lionsgate dropped the film for unknown reasons. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on August 26, 2016. Reception The Sea of Trees was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 16%, based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The consensus states, \\"Dull, maudlin, and fundamentally empty, The Sea of Trees extinguishes the contributions of a talented cast and marks a depressing low point in director Gus Van Sant's career.\\" At its May 2015 debut at the Cannes Film Festival, the film was met with harsh critical reception; it was loudly booed and laughed at by an audience of critics, with critic Scott Foundas calling it a film \\"for nobody.\\" Some critics were more impressed by the film; Pete Hammond wrote \\"Their film deserves a better fate\\" and he praised its \\"pared sentimentality.\\" While Hammond was also impressed with the \\"beautiful lush score\\", others found it \\"cloying\\" and \\"ever-present.\\" Critic Richard Mowe stated this audience reaction should \\"give the film‚Äôs creative team pause for reflection about exactly where they went so badly awry.\\" Justin Chang, chief film critic for Variety, deemed the film \\"dramatically stillborn, commercially unpromising\\", though Chang did single out the film's aesthetic as noteworthy, stating \\"Cinematographer Kasper Tuxen works wonders with the forest‚Äôs softly diffused light by day, and makes exquisite use of a campfire to illuminate McConaughey‚Äôs and Watanabe‚Äôs faces at night.\\" He also described co-star Naomi Watts as \\"solidly moving and sometimes awesomely passive- aggressive.\\" Nonetheless, he concludes that the film is, \\"Almost impressive in the way it shifts from dreary two-hander to so-so survival thriller to terminal-illness weepie to M. Night Shyamalan/Nicholas Sparks-level spiritual hokum, this risibly long-winded drama is perhaps above all a profound cultural insult, milking the lush green scenery of Japan‚Äôs famous Aokigahara forest for all it‚Äôs worth, while giving co-lead Ken Watanabe little to do other than moan in agony, mutter cryptically, and generally try to act as though McConaughey‚Äôs every word isn‚Äôt boring him (pardon the expression) to death.\\" Further critical dissatisfaction with the film has been attributed to the fact that \\"the twists and turns of this narrative fail to ring true with too many implausibilities in the plotting to give any credibility\\" and with its \\"complete lack of narrative momentum, it all adds up to a film that's easily Van Sant's worst, and is a sad black mark on McConaughey's mostly excellent recent run. Ultimately, \\"Sea of Trees\\" feels like an entirely appropriate title: it makes you feel like you're drowning, and it's full of sap.\\" See also * The Forest References External links Category:2015 films Category:2010s mystery drama films Category:A24 films Category:American films Category:American mystery drama films Category:Films about suicide Category:Films directed by Gus Van Sant Category:Films set in Aokigahara Category:Films set in forests Category:Films set in Japan Category:Films set on islands Category:Foreign films shot in Japan Category:Films shot in Massachusetts Category:2015 drama films Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"The Sea of Trees"},{"id":"43428767","text":"Judge Zdzis≈Çaw ≈Åukaszkiewicz was a member of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland () upon the conclusion of World War II. The Commission has been replaced, upon the collapse of the Soviet-imposed communism in Poland, with the government-affiliated Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) serving similar purpose at present. ≈Åukaszkiewicz was the author of the first historical research into the Nazi German extermination camps including Majdanek and Treblinka, on the territory of occupied Poland during the genocidal Operation Reinhard of the Holocaust. Plan of Treblinka drawn in 1945 by surveyor T. Trautsolt; with the rubber stamp of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland (or District Court, illegible), and signed by ≈Åukaszkiewicz. Simplified version (with already typed legend) was published in his book titled Ob√≥z strace≈Ñ w Treblince by PIW, Warsaw, 1946. Holocaust research ≈Åukaszkiewicz conducted his research at the time when virtually nothing was known about the scale and the exact way in which these atrocities were committed. He published his first findings already in 1946 along with the results of legal and medical inquiries, sworn affidavits of land surveyor T. Trautsolt, Dr H. Wakulicz, the evidence collected by railway workers but most importantly, the testimonies of former prisoners of Treblinka extermination camp who managed to survive the revolt and took part in the Commission's forensic work. ≈Åukaszkiewicz examined the selected graves exhumed at Treblinka I Arbeitslager. His estimate of the total number of the victims of gassing was based on the already proven record of 156 transports with an average of 5,000 prisoners each. Many published results of his enquiries are still considered paramount to the understanding of the Final Solution, even though some specifics have also been revised by modern science. ≈Åukaszkiewicz is being quoted by the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, the Britannica Polish edition, and the Polish Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN among others. Also, many professional historians including Wolfgang Scheffler and Czes≈Çaw Rajca used his publications as the source of pertinent data. =Challenges= ≈Åukaszkiewicz was the first Polish researcher to study the 1943 massacre committed at the Majdanek concentration camp under the codename Operation Erntefest. The more substantial revisions to his early research (published in 1948) have been made only in the 1960s and 1970s, when the first testimonies of the Holocaust perpetrators appeared in German court documents during trials. Majdanek crematoria upon liberation, inside an already dismantled building Although his research was further revised by Holocaust scholars, ≈Åukaszkiewicz was the first Polish scientist to challenge the evidence for the prosecution submitted in 1946 by the Soviets at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg. The completely unrealistic estimate of 1.5 million people murdered at the Majdanek concentration camp was based on the theoretical capacity of Majdanek coke-fueled crematoria. This number claimed by the Soviet-led Special Commission was lowered by ≈Åukaszkiewicz by over one million victims based on his own evidence, down to 360,000 which ‚Äì at that particular time ‚Äì constituted a challenge requiring a substantial amount of personal integrity.

History The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these five lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Topsia was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

In the eastern fringes of Kolkata, the neighbourhoods such as Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa, were populated largely with people who migrated from poverty-stricken and caste- ridden villages, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They came with dreams of a better life but landed in the slums with open drains, pigsties, factory chimneys and pungent chemicals. They found work in the tanneries and factories, and also engaged in menial work. A big proportion of them were Chamars, but there also were Doms, Dosads, Mehtars and Kahars. They were all Harijans and they formed a majority. They escaped from the petty persecution they faced in their villages but were far removed from mainstream urban life and culture. They have been here, living in depressing conditions, for more than a century.Bandyopadhyay, Raghab, The Inheritors: Slum and Pavement Life in Calcutta, in Calcutta, The Living City Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp.s 78‚Äì82, First published 1990, 2005 edition, Oxford University Press, Geography =Police district= Topsia police station is one of the nine police stations in the South-east division of Kolkata Police.

Builder and building details  Prime Trust Heights was a residential project developed by Prime Sristi Housing Pvt Ltd. Trust heights consisted of two eleven-storied apartment blocks situated at No.52 Kundrathur Main Road near Porur junction. Tower The Faith had four apartments of 2 bhk and Tower The Belief had four apartments of 3bhk in each floor . Units were priced at 5250 per sq/ft.  Collapse  After heavy rain on Saturday, June 28, the under-construction block \\"Faith\\" at Moulivakkam, a suburb of Chennai collapsed at 5.30pm due to lightning strike trapping many constructions workers under the debris.  Rescue operations  Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue force along with National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) from Arakkonam base managed the rescue operations. The final death toll was 61 people consisting constructions workers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh and Gajapati district of Odisha.  Investigation  A single Judge investigation committee and a SIT team were formed by Tamil Nadu government to investigate the cause of the disaster. The major reason for this disaster was due to the carelessness of the builders in Chennai. The chief engineer handling the construction accepted his mistake and was fined by the police.

Regupathy Commission that inquired into the circumstances led to the collapse of the multi-storeyed building at Moulivakkam in which 55 persons were killed and many injured, has made series of recommendations including a comprehensive legislation for making insurance package compulsory for builders. The incident took place on June 28, 2014. The report of the commission that was tabled in Assembly on Tuesday suggested comprehensive legislation or vitalisation of the existing legislation so that essential features like insurance package creating triangular responsibilities among bank, builder and customer could me made. Introducing penal provisions, insisting upon the construction firms taking up mega projects to deposit a sizable sum in fixed deposit for 10 years are the other measures recommended by the commission. Justice Regupathy also recommended reconstitution of the CMDA at the foundation level by forming a committee consisting of a technical officer of the agency, a law officer, experts in soil investigation, foundation design, structural engineering to compulsorily monitor all mega projects. \\"Apart from ensuring quality and compliance issues, the main task of the committee should be to inspect the site at all crucial stages, particularly during earth working for foundation, foundation concerting, laying the roof of basement floor and laying of the roof at each floor,\\" Justice Regupathy stressed. The commission has made a strong case for constituting a special squad to check primarily all mega projects taking place in and around the City limits so that recurrence of any bad incidents could me immediately stopped. while pointing out that the incident was the best example about the dark side behind the real estate and construction business where money was considered to be the only ambition while lives of human beings/customers were put at stake.

He was re-elected in 2017 with a majority increase of over 10,000 which was a significant increase from a majority of 2,500 in 2014. It was reported that this was the largest personal vote increase in the country. Personal life Doocey is a member of the well-known Carter family. Family patriarch Maurice Carter, a Christchurch City Councillor for over 40 years (1956‚Äì1989), was his grandfather, and the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Carter, is his uncle. Doocey grew up in Christchurch and attended St Bede's College for his secondary schooling. The Dooceys bought their current home in Rangiora, which currently falls into the Waimakariri electorate, in April 2014 after boundary changes put his former Redwood home out of the electorate. Political career Doocey stood in the 2013 Christchurch East by-election placing second behind Poto Williams. At the time, Doocey was a manager for the Canterbury District Health Board. The party's Canterbury Westland Regional Chair, Roger Bridge, noted that a sitting government has never won a by-election in an electorate that it did not already hold. Bridge later conceded that it would be \\"very, very hard for us to win\\". When Kate Wilkinson, National MP for the electorate, announced in early November 2013 that she would retire at the end of the term of the 50th Parliament, rumours immediately surfaced that Doocey is going to replace her as the candidate in the Waimakariri electorate, and the Christchurch East by-election was for him to gain experience in contesting an election. Doocey left his job in June 2014 to focus on the Waimakariri election campaign. He beat Labour's Clayton Cosgrove with an increased majority compared to the . For the 51st New Zealand Parliament Doocey was appointed Deputy Chair of the Social Services Select Committee. In 2016 he brought a cross-party delegation of the Social Services Select Committee to Canterbury to hear from service providers about their response to communities‚Äô psycho-social recovery needs in post-earthquake Canterbury. Also in his first term, Doocey was appointed third Whip of the National Government. For the 52nd New Zealand Parliament, Doocey serves as National's Junior Whip, working closely with the Party's Senior Whip. He was also appointed Spokesperson for Mental Health and is National's Associate Spokesperson for Health, and a member of the Health Select Committee. As National‚Äôs first ever Spokesperson for Mental Health, in 2018, Doocey wrote to every political party in Parliament to invite them to join a cross-party approach to mental health that would focus on developing solutions and policy over a longer period than the Parliamentary three-year term. Doocey believed that by initiating a bipartisan approach to mental health this would break down some of the barriers to progress to improve mental health outcomes in New Zealand. On 28 August 2019, Sir John Kirwan launched the Mental Health and Addictions Wellbeing cross- party group, with the executive consisting of Matt Doocey, Louisa Wall (Labour), Chloe Swarbrick (Green Party), Jenny Marcroft (NZ First) and David Seymour (ACT), to work together to improve mental health and wellbeing in New Zealand. Previous life Born and bred in Canterbury, New Zealand, Doocey worked in mental health and health-care management in both New Zealand and the UK. He studied Counselling Psychology at Weltech, has a BSc (Hons) in Social Policy, an MA in Healthcare Management from Kingston University in London and an MSc in Global Politics from Birkbeck, University of London.

The Chief of Naval Research has a rank of Rear Admiral, and is in charge of the Office of Naval Research. The Chief of Naval Research has responsibility for basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development components of the Navy's research and development programs (the first three of the seven categories used in the Department of Defense research and development budget, often referred to as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), as well as the Navy's intellectual property policy. The Chief of Naval Research also coordinates with other research and development agencies within the Department of the Navy, such as the Naval Warfare Centers of the Naval Systems Commands. Other positions in the Office of Naval Research leadership include the Vice Chief of Naval Research (a one-star Marine Corps brigadier general), the Assistant Chief of Naval Research and Commanding Officer of ONR Global (both captains), and the Executive Director and Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Research (both civilians). The Chief of Naval Research reports directly to the civilian Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition), and is thus not organizationally subordinate to the Chief of Naval Operations, the senior military officer in the entire Navy. History The predecessor to the Office of Naval Research was the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development, an institution within the Navy during World War II meant to coordinate between the military-wide Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), Navy materiel bureaus, and civilian research organizations. The organization was formed in 1941 and was nicknamed the \\"Bird Dogs\\" due to their skill at finding and solving interorganizational problems. Jerome Clarke Hunsaker was interim chief, followed by Rear Admiral Julius A. Furer. OSRD was disbanded after the war, and the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development was incorporated into the new Navy Office of Research and Inventions, headed by Harold Bowen, which became the Office of Naval Research in 1945. =List of Chiefs of Naval Research = Several former Chiefs of Naval Research photographed in 2005.

She has previously served as the mayor of the Westland District. Political career = Westland District Council = Pugh was elected to the Westland District Council in 1998 and served two terms before being elected as the district's first woman mayor in 2004, succeeding John Drylie. In 2007 she was returned as mayor unopposed. She stood down at the 2013 elections and was succeeded as mayor by Michael Havill. While serving as mayor of Westland District Council, Pugh was accused of failure to declare a financial conflict of interest. = Member of Parliament = In the 2014 general election Pugh contested the West Coast-Tasman electorate as the candidate of the New Zealand National Party. Also ranked number 52 on the National Party list, she just missed out on winning a list seat. Based on preliminary results, she would have entered Parliament, but in the final results, National's proportion of the party vote reduced and the Green Party's Steffan Browning won the seat she would have taken. Pugh remained first-in- line should a vacancy arise in a list seat held by a National Party MP during the 51st New Zealand Parliament, and following Tim Groser's resignation in December 2015 she was sworn in as a member of parliament on 9 February 2016 after the summer recess. In the 2017 general election Pugh had a higher ranking (number 44) in the National Party list, and results on election night suggested that National had won enough seats (58) for Pugh to return to parliament. However, the official count (including special votes) showed that National had won two fewer seats (a total of 56) than the preliminary count indicated, meaning that Pugh did not return to Parliament. Due to her history of going in and out of parliament frequently due to special votes, Pugh describes herself as the 'Yo-yo MP'. In February 2018 Pugh and several other \\"next-in-line\\" list candidates attended National's parliamentary caucus meeting to help ease their transition into parliament should they enter during the course of the parliamentary term. Following Bill English's resignation from Parliament in March 2018, Pugh was declared elected as a list MP for the National Party. National Party leader Simon Bridges (in office 2018-2020) described Pugh as \\"fucking useless\\" in a phone call with Jami-Lee Ross that Ross released on Facebook in October 2018. Following the release of the recording, Bridges apologised to Pugh. Pugh later voted with the majority against Bridges in the May 2020 leadership spill. Personal life Pugh and her husband John live on their farm at Turiwhate, near Kumara. She does not believe in pharmaceutical drugs, preferring chiropractic treatment.

However they fell short of an outright majority and therefore were unable to form the government. This led the then Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung to invite the Aam Aadmi Party, the second largest party after the BJP, to form the government. On 28 December 2013, AAP formed the state government after taking outside support from the Indian National Congress. AAP's leader Arvind Kejriwal, who defeated the incumbent chief minister Sheila Dikshit, became the 7th chief minister of Delhi. However, on 14 February 2014 (after 49 days of rule), Arvind Kejriwal resigned from his post citing the reason as his government's inability to table the Jan Lokpal Bill in Delhi Assembly for discussion due to stiff opposition from other political parties in the house. Delhi remained thereafter under President's Rule for about a year.

The first United States military unit sent to Europe was the First Aeronautic Detachment of seven naval officers and 122 enlisted men who arrived in France on 5 June 1917. These men became the nucleus of the United States Naval Forces in Europe. They formulated a strategic bombing plan approved by the Secretary of the Navy on 30 April 1918, but chronic difficulties in obtaining aircraft prevented establishment of an effective bombing campaign before the war ended six months later. Of an originally planned force of 108 DH.4-day bombers, about a dozen became operational before the end of hostilities. Background The Imperial German Navy established Flanders U-boat flotillas in March 1915. Type UB and UC submarines were based in Ostend and Zeebrugge with repair yards at Bruges. These coastal submarines operated in the English Channel, along the English coast of the North Sea and in the Western Approaches. U-boats were sinking over 150 ships per month by late 1916; and the resultant loss of both cargoes and import capacity threatened the ability of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to continue the war. Concept One of the Allied efforts to reduce shipping losses was a day and night bombing campaign against the bases from which the U-boats operated. United States naval aviators were to establish a Northern Bombing Group headquarters near Ardres for a sustained bombing effort against the U-boat bases. The group was to consist of a day wing and a night wing operating from six aerodromes with a separate repair and supply base, all in the area of Calais and Dunkirk. Each of the six Navy night wing squadrons was to have ten Caproni Ca.5 bombers operating in two flights of five; and each of the six Marine Corps day wing squadrons was to have eighteen Airco DH.4 bombers operating in three flights of six. Implementation Difficulty in obtaining aircraft caused reduction of planned strength to four-day squadrons and four night squadrons on 31 May 1918: Night squadrons 1 and 2 were assigned to Saint-Inglevert Airfield (aerodrome A). Night squadrons 3 and 4 were assigned to aerodrome B in Campagne. Aerodrome C in Sangatte was to be built as a dummy but was cancelled after objections by local residents. Day squadrons 7 and 8 were assigned to aerodrome D at Oye-Plage. Day squadrons 9 and 10 were assigned to aerodrome E at Le Frene. Aerodrome F at Alembon served as a bomb dump and was available as a reserve field. By June, the military situation in France raised doubts about the safety of bases; so on 20 July a British site in Eastleigh was designated the repair and supply base where newly delivered aircraft would be assembled and tested. Caproni had projected delivery of thirty bombers in June and July, and eighty more in August. Only eighteen had been delivered by the end of August, and their Fiat engines were unsatisfactory. Arrangements were made to equip future Caproni deliveries with Isotta Fraschini V.6 engines; but the improved aircraft were not available prior to the First Armistice at Compi√®gne. Substitution of Handley Page Type O bombers was similarly unsuccessful until after the armistice. The only Northern Bombing Group night raid was made on 15 August 1918 by a single Ca.5 bomber over Ostend; but seven United States Navy pilots and about 40 enlisted men participated in several raids flying two No. 214 Squadron RAF Handley Page bombers. Of an originally projected strength of sixty night bombers, the war ended with six Ca.5s at the night wing aerodromes; and only two of these were operational. transported United States Marine Corps pilots of the day wing to France. Headquarters company and squadrons A, B and C of the First Marine Aviation Force arrived in Brest, France aboard on 30 July 1918. The squadrons were redesignated as 7, 8 and 9 upon arrival. Prior to the delivery of Northern Bombing Group aircraft, Marine Corps pilots began flying bombing missions in No. 218 Squadron RAF bombers on 9 August 1918, and in No. 217 Squadron RAF bombers on 21 August. The first DH.4-day bomber was delivered on 7 September 1918. As the American DH.4s and substituted Airco DH.9s became operational, they accompanied No. 217 and 218 squadron raids. The first daytime mission undertaken entirely by Northern Bombing Group aircraft was a 14 October raid by day wing squadron 9 dropping seventeen bombs with a total weight of on the Tielt railway yard. Seven more raids were made by day wing squadrons 8 and 9 before operations were cancelled on 27 October. Two day wing bombers were lost in action; and the war ended with an operational strength of twelve DH.4s and seventeen DH.9s of the originally projected force of 108-day bombers.

It is also a commonly used emergency center during disasters such as the 2013 Tasmanian bushfires. Despite its name it is not the City of Hobart's seat of government, which is Hobart Town Hall ‚Äì historically a matter of confusion. History Prior to the erection of the hall, the area where it stands was reserved for city markets. The building was designed by Raymond (\\"Rusty\\") N Butler in association with Flack Ricards and Frank Heyward and the building cost ¬£27,000. The City Hall was completed in 1915, with a formal opening in July. It was reported as being capable of seating 5,000 people when it opened. In 1940, there were attempts to convert the hall to an indoor ice rink, however it was delayed indefinitely after the City Hall was commandeered by the army in 1940 for six months to use for storage. In 1952 it held what was at the time the largest sports carnival ever held in Tasmania, as part of an appeal by the Olympic Council to raise funds for sending Australian athletes to Helsinki Olympics. Usage The City Hall has served as a venue for many diverse events, including boxing matches, the 1949 Australian Basketball Championships, silent movie screenings, a ball for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, speeches from the Duke of Gloucester, and Miss Tasmania and Miss Australia Grand Finals. Today it also forms part of the network of locations for the Festival of Voices.

The book is considered Bookchin's magnum opus, but it has also been criticized as utopian. Summary Bookchin is critical of the class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw was a more complex view of societies. Bookchin writes that, \\"My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a \\"classless\\" or \\"libertarian\\" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which ‚Äì even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion ‚Äì would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.\\" Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche, \\"The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern Freudians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day‚Äì‚Äìnot merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.\\" Reception =Reviews= The Ecology of Freedom received a positive review from Susan Marie Szasz in Library Journal, a mixed review from Karen L. Field in American Anthropologist, and a negative review from the political scientist Alan Wolfe in The Nation. Wolfe's review was followed by an exchange of letters between Bookchin and Wolfe. The book was also reviewed by R. Clarke in New Scientist and R. Williams in The Technology Review. Szasz described the book as well written. Field wrote that Bookchin \\"reminds us of what humankind has been, warns us of what it is becoming, and dares us to imagine what it could be in a social structure geared to interdependence and environmental sensitivity rather than to competition and wanton destruction.\\" She credited him with describing \\"essential differences in outlook between class and preclass societies\\", clarifying \\"the philosophical linkage between the propensities to objectify nature and to objectify one‚Äôs fellow human being\\", and providing a \\"valuable inventory of Western antiestablishment currents from the Adamites and Ranters to May 1968\\". However, she criticized his account of the emergence of civilization for its reliance on the anthropologists Paul Radin and Dorothy D. Lee, and found his description of preliterate societies oversimplified and \\"sanitized\\" in its emphasis on peaceful egalitarianism. She believed that he deliberately minimized \\"the importance of technoeconomic factors\\", and unconvincingly proposed \\"age stratification as the key to domination\\". She also maintained that parts of the work suffered from a \\"disappointing Eurocentrism\\", and that it failed to make use of recent literature on the place of technology in capitalist society. Wolfe wrote that while he was receptive to a radical critique of society, he found the book \\"obsessive, dogmatic and angry\\" and did not believe it would gain as much attention as it deserved. He criticized Bookchin's negative attitude toward New Age views, his account of the development of modern society, and the hostile language he used to describe many authors with whom he disagreed. He believed that the work was utopian and did not explain how to solve society's problems. Bookchin, in reply, accused Wolfe of ignoring its central themes. Wolfe responded by charging Bookchin with misrepresenting his critique; he also accused him of egocentrism. =Other evaluations= The anarchist author Ulrike Heider described The Ecology of Freedom as \\"a utopian work\\" in which the \\"social and political reality of the past, present, and future are pretty much faded out and capitalism is neither mentioned nor criticized\\". Bookchin responded in The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly, calling Heider's criticism unethical and a distortion of his views. He described Heider's assertion that he does not criticize capitalism as a fabrication. The philosopher Steven Best described The Ecology of Freedom as a classic, writing in Organization & Environment that, of Bookchin's books, it is the one that best captures the themes of his work as a whole. He credited Bookchin with making an influential critique of \\"Marxist historical narratives\\"; he noted that the book also influenced feminism. He complimented Bookchin for his interpretation of history. However, writing in 1998, he noted that some of Bookchin's claims were controversial, and that \\"Bookchin has evolved beyond certain positions\\" taken in the book. Brian Tokar wrote in Capitalism Nature Socialism that while The Ecology of Freedom \\"received high praise\\", it was also considered a \\"utopian social criticism\\". The philosopher Andrew Light wrote that The Ecology of Freedom was \\"widely read by both theorists and practitioners in the ecological movement\\". He also suggested that it was Bookchin's best-known book. He credited Bookchin with providing an extensively developed and novel perspective on social domination, writing that it, \\"made Bookchin one of the most widely read ecological thinkers in the last thirty years.\\" The activist Joel Kovel described the book as \\"Bookchin's most important work\\". However, he criticized Bookchin's treatment of Marx and Marxism. He compared The Ecology of Freedom to the Marxist humanist philosopher Raya Dunayevskaya's Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution (1981), but did not believe that Bookchin would welcome the comparison. The political scientist Robyn Eckersley described the book as Bookchin's \\"magnum opus\\". The philosopher John Clark criticized Bookchin discussion of politics, arguing that he provided \\"little detailed discussion of ecological situatedness and bioregional particularity, despite a theoretical commitment to such values.\\" Janet Biehl wrote that The Ecology of Freedom was one of Bookchin's most important books. She noted that while it has been regarded as Bookchin's magnum opus, she considers several of Bookchin's subsequent books at least equally important. She credited Bookchin with demonstrating that \\"the rise of hierarchy eroded the complementarity of relatively egalitarian communities long before the appearance of property ownership.\\" However, she also wrote that while he was working on The Ecology of Freedom, Bookchin was influenced by a \\"New Age anthropology\\" that he later rejected. According to Biehl, he regretted its influence on the book. Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan studied The Ecology of Freedom while in solitary confinement in a Turkish prison, and was reportedly impressed by the work, consequently issuing a manifesto titled Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan, which called on the Kurdistan Workers' Party to implement the ideas of social ecology.

Career  ƒåmejla completed his studies in technical cybernetics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague and has acted as a manager at NFMG Financial Management Group (NFMG), Appian Group and other companies. In the 1990s, he was the bass guitarist of the band Tich√° Dohoda. In 2013, he co-founded the band V≈°ichni Svat√≠, which released its debut album ‚ÄúVyt√°hni mƒõ z davu‚Äù (‚ÄúPull Me Out of the Crowd‚Äù) in 2013. ƒåmejla can be labelled, with a bit of hyperbole, the embodiment of the American dream in the Czech environment. He started his entrepreneurial activities while still at university, first selling books. After a number of years working freelance, he partnered up with a classmate from basic school, Petr Kraus, who founded NFMG, a financial group, in the mid-1990s. NFMG gradually became one of the most important non-banking companies in the Czech Republic. Mr ƒåmejla was the company‚Äôs Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors. NFMG was originally established by Petr Kraus and Anton√≠n Kol√°ƒçek. Over time, ƒåmejla acquired fifty percent of NFMG, and held on to this share until 2001, when he sold it to Kraus. In 2002, he became the CEO of Appian Group Europe. In 2003, ƒåmejla, together with Ji≈ô√≠ Divi≈°, coordinated the strategic entrance of Appian Group into ≈†koda Plze≈à, which, following Lubom√≠r Soudek‚Äôs era, was in a state of clinical death. Appian Group purchased a part of the company for 350 million Czech crowns from the State and the remainder from the receiver in bankruptcy for 450 million crowns. The company then underwent successful restructuring, and today is a leading producer of transportation systems.  MUS case  In October 2013, the Swiss courts sentenced him to 48 months in prison for fraud and money laundering. He was to have committed these crimes when Appian purchased a minority share in Mosteck√° uheln√° spoleƒçnost (MUS) from the Czech State in 1999. He appealed against this decision at the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland in Lausanne. In an interview for the daily Pr√°vo on 16 April regarding the MUS case, he said that ‚Äúthe idea that someone in the mid-1990s was chewing on the end of a pencil and planning to defraud the Czech State over the next twenty years and steal MUS is so bizarre that a person who makes such a claim has to be mentally ill or have something up his sleeve, or both.‚Äù In the same interview, ƒåmejla provided his assessment of the situation in which MUS found itself in 1999. To quote: ‚ÄúThe fact that the brown coal industry even exists in this country today is due in a large part to the management of MUS at the time. The State decided to shut it down, and the management, in the interest of the company, decided to do everything in its power to ensure its survival.‚Äù  References  Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Czech businesspeople Category:Czech musicians ","title":"Marek ƒåmejla"},{"id":"43430302","text":"Wamanripa (local name for Senecio or a species of it,Louis Girault: Kallawaya - gu√©risseurs itin√©rants des Andes.

The farmhouse's characteristic Italianate features include its central belvedere, its hipped roof's wide eaves with paired brackets, and its tall, narrow windows with arched lintels. State senator Theodore S. Chapman purchased the farm in 1891 and renamed it Homeridge; the Chapman family ran the farm until 1960. The farm is a well- preserved representative of a working farm, and two of its contributing buildings once housed hired farm workers. In addition, the farm's production in the 20th century reflected statewide agricultural trends towards grain farming rather than livestock farming.

Duncombe was sponsored by the Blind Skateboards skateboard deck company, founded by Mark Gonzales, for nine years and released a signature model skate shoe with Globe International. Early life After being born in Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia, Duncombe relocated with his family to the area around Brunswick Heads and Byron Bay, both in the Australian state of New South Wales. Duncombe first began skateboarding at the age of eight or nine years while in Brunswick Heads after being influenced by a family friend‚Äîhis father subsequently purchased a \\"Delta\\"-brand skateboard for him to ride. Duncombe's first skateboarding sponsor was Wreck surf shop in Byron Bay and he then received free products from Electric Sunglasses, as representatives of the brand were from Byron Bay. Professional skateboarding Duncombe's first major sponsors were SMP and Carel, and he was 12 years of age when he embarked on his first tour with the SMP team, which also included Jamie Goodwin, Ryan Hidassy and Lachlan Pettit. At the time, Duncombe was still attending school and, after a short period skateboarding with SMP in Sydney, he relocated with his father to Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Duncombe's father eventually allowed Duncombe to leave school and focus on skateboarding during their time in Queensland. After the founding of Criminal Skateboards by Sydney skateboarder Glen Scott, Duncombe was recruited by Scott and he joined the team, which also included Andrew Currie, Kerry Fisher and Jim Fowlie, on a tour of Canberra, Australia. Duncombe explained in a 2014 interview with Scott that he believed he was accepted by the older Criminal team because of his willingness to drink a similar level of alcohol. Scott, who was also involved with the SMP brand, oversaw Duncombe's first international tours to New Zealand and Europe. Duncombe competed at the 2003 World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, at the age of 14 years, and placed second, prior to appearing in the 2004 video Northern Lights. With six sponsors supporting him and a crowd of 15,000 spectators watching, Duncombe also competed at the 2004 World Cup but did not proceed past the first round. During an interview at the 2004 World Cup, Duncombe revealed his situation in terms of skateboarding: \\"It's still my hobby. It'll always still be my hobby. Sometimes I don't realise how lucky I am to get paid for it. Um, it's unbelievable, like, getting paid to do your hobby, it's just... I'm so happy.\\" During the 2003 World Cup, Duncombe was riding for World Industries alongside fellow Australian Richard Flude, and was asked to ride for Blind Skateboards‚ÄîBlind team member James Craig and Cory Shepard initially expressed interest‚Äîduring a subsequent tour organised by the distributors of both World and Blind. After Duncombe informally agreed to join the brand, it was on his next visit to the United States (US) that he was asked to join the team by brand manager Bill Weiss. Duncombe explained in 2014: > ... and, we're skating this 13-stair rail ... \\"So, we want you on Blind.\\" > [Weiss] ... I'm [Duncombe] like, \\"Are you serious?\\" He's like, \\"Yep, and you > need a video part out and an ad in three months.\\" I'm like, \\"Ooo ... kaaay.\\" > ... Then, that's when I was just like, \\"Alright, this is happening.\\" Blind called Duncombe into the offices of the brand's American distributor, Dwindle Distribution, in 2006 and informed him that he had been assigned professional status by the brand, providing him with his first signature skateboard deck design and a giant cookie. Both Duncombe and fellow team rider Jani Laitiala were announced as professional riders in August 2006 and Duncombe's first model, which used the same design as the Jack Daniel's alcohol brand, was forced off the market after a cease and desist order. In 2010 Duncombe's first signature skate shoe model, named \\"The Bender\\", was released by Globe. The shoe release event was a party on a boat in Newport Beach, California, California, US and Duncombe's family were flown from Australia to attend. After nine years with Blind and a similarly lengthy period with the Globe footwear brand, Duncombe parted ways with both sponsors over 2012 and 2013. Duncombe explained in a December 2013 interview that his pay cheques from Blind progressively lessened, as new younger riders joined the team, and his contract finally ended along with other older team riders, such as Craig and Jake Brown. In terms of Globe, Duncombe stated: \\"I think we just got sick of each other ... They just got sick of my antics and I wasn‚Äôt ready to change. ‚ÄòTime for change‚Äô ‚Äì no, no change.\\" In his 2014 interview with Scott, Duncombe provided further insight into his personality by revealing that he is the type of person who instinctively acts in opposition to what others are trying to change or instil within him. Following the founding of the Life Extension (LE) Skateboards skateboard deck company, by professional skateboarder Nick Trapasso and Pat \\"Sinner\\" Pasquale, Duncombe contacted the cofounders and negotiated a place on the team. Duncombe said that the brand \\"was something new and fresh and I saw a chance to be a part of it from its start.\\" Duncombe filmed a video part for LE's debut video, Theatrix, which premiered in the US in July 2014, and the part was also promoted on the Thrasher magazine website. The Australian premiere of the video was held on 28 July 2014. =Sponsors= As of 2016, Duncombe is sponsored by Life Extension, Modus, Arrow Wheels, Theeve, Nike SB AU, Happy Hour Shades, skateboard.com.au and Geelong Skate Shop. Awards Following his international skateboard video debut in What If?, Duncombe was awarded the \\"Skater of the Year\\" accolade by Australian skateboard publication SLAM. The magazine explained in 2013: \\"... a 17-year-old Jake Duncombe took the title in 2006. A massive year of ripping in Europe and the USA, and this heavy debut international part in the Blind video, What If?, made Jake the undisputed winner.\\" Videography References External links *LE Skateboards official website Category:Australian skateboarders Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Tweed Heads, New South Wales Category:Sportspeople from New South Wales ","title":"Jake Duncombe"},{"id":"43430482","title":"The Boat Race 1864"},{"id":"43430526","text":"Oleksandr Petrovych Khvoshch (; born 1 October 1981 in Stakhanov, Ukrainian SSR) is an amateur Ukrainian Greco-Roman wrestler, who competed in the men's lightweight category.

He was pastor in Camberwell. Life Steane was born in March 1798 in Oxford. His father dealt in wines and spirits and the family attended New Road Baptist Church. Steane went to school where he was taught by James Hinton and became a lifelong friend with his son, John Howard Hinton. Steane's interests were at the New Road church and although he briefly worked as a chemist the church agreed that he was to be a minister. He was sent for training at Bristol Baptist College and then unsuccessfully at Edinburgh University. He returned to London where after a brief trial he started on his long career as minister at Denmark place in Camberwell. In 1823 Steane was appointed to be the pastor of the Baptist church in Denmark Place in Camberwell. In 1826 he was on a committee that published a new Baptist hymnal called the New Selection. The book included one hymn by Steane called Prophetic era! blissful day! (The Triumphs of Christ anticipated). In 1834 he married Mary Stevenson, the granddaughter of Abraham Booth, another Baptist minister, and they had five children.Biblicalsociety.org.uk - Abraham Booth and some of his descendants (Ernest A. Payne) In 1840 Steane attended the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention and he was included in the commemorative painting.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1841, National Portrait Gallery, London, NPG599, Given by British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1880 Steane also helped found the Bible Translation Society charity after the British and Foreign Bible Society refused to fund a translation. The pivotal case was a translation of the Bible into Bengali. William Yates who had made the translation had chosen to translate the word \\"Baptise\\" as \\"Immerse\\" and this was in line with the Baptist beliefs and not necessarily every denomination. Steane served as its first secretary and later its treasurer. The formation of new bible translation societies proved divisive and expensive and they were eventually demerged. In 1846 Steane was appointed as one of the people required to set up a conference that resulted in the Evangelical Alliance. He is seen as one of the founders and he edited the organisation's periodical, Evangelical Christendom. Steane's failing health caused the church to appoint Rev Charles Stanford as a co-pastor at Camberwell in May 1858. Three years later Stanford took the job on full-time, but Steane was left with the title of Pastor until 1866. His first wife, Mary, died in 1862 and in 1864 he married Eliza Pigeon and gave up editing the Evangelical Christendom. Steane died at his home near Rickmansworth.Rosemary Chadwick, ‚ÄòSteane, Edward (1798‚Äì1882)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 July 2014 References Category:1798 births Category:1882 deaths Category:English Baptist ministers ","title":"Edward Steane"},{"id":"43430538","text":"Filiberto Mercado (born 28 June 1938) is a former Mexican cyclist.

The riots occurred between Muslims, led by Muharram Ali Pappu, and Sikhs, led by Shri Guru Singh Sabha, over a territory and religious differences. Three people were killed and several were injured. The ruling Samajwadi Party alleged that it was an act of RSS, the BJP blamed ISI and the UP police allege that the riot was well planned to divide members of the two minority communities. In February 2020, Muslims relinquished their claim to disputed Saharanpur territory as a gesture of gratitude to Sikhs. Cause The root of clashes is a land dispute between former MLA Moharram Ali aka Pappu Ali and Gurudwara Singh Sabha in Kutubsher area. The land is adjacent to the gurdwara near the railway station, of which both groups claims ownership. On 25 July, members of the gurdwara flagged off the construction to expand the gurdwara premises, and clashes broke out the next day. The gurdwara management had purchased land 15 years ago, but Pappu claims that the land belongs to the mosque and Wakf board and there cannot be construction without their permission. A petition was filed in the civil court 10 years previously by Moharram Ali Pappu in the civil court, stating that the land belonged to the mosque. The Hindustan Times wrote on July 30, 2014, that three years ago some members of the local gurdwara committee met Pappu to settle the land row. Money was also offered to him but the deal fell through. One Abdul Wahab had challenged the gurdwara‚Äôs claim over the land and told the court he had done so at the behest of Pappu. In May 2013, additional district judge passed an order stating that land belonged to the gurdwara. Clashes and security On 26 July, Muslims supporting Pappu came together from Saharanpur, Moradabad and Muzaffarnagar, and attacked members of Gurdwara Singh Sabha using guns and swords. Members responded to them by pelting with stones. The fighting led to the death of three people and left 33 injured. Shops of other Sikhs were set on fire. A curfew was imposed by the district administration and shoot-at-sight orders were given. Police arrested more than 60 people. The state transport cancelled all 569 buses which pass or terminate at Saharanpur. Forces including PAC, CRPF, RAF and ITBP are deployed in the troubled areas. Accusations The main accused, Muharram Ali Pappu, was arrested on 30 July 2014 and booked under the National Security Act. Pappu is a former councillor of Saharanpur Municipal Corporation and has a criminal record. The police have registered a case against him and 66 others and charged 75 cases against them. Moharram Ali Pappu had filed a petition in the court against the construction. Prabhjit Singh, a member of Shri Guru Singh Sabha, said that Pappu demanded 25 lakh for an out-of-court settlement, to which they did not agree.

His father's name was Liaquat Hussain Khan, a court musician in the Jaipur State, and his mother's name was Alla Rakhi Beghum. Sharafat's father's roots go back to classical musician Inayet Hussain Khan (1845 ‚Äì 1936) who founded Atrauli Gharana. His maternal grandfather was Mehboob Khan (Daras Piya). Mehboob Khan also belonged to Atrauli Gharana. Sharafat Hussain Khan's music was greatly influenced by the Rangile Gharana of his mother's family. This gharana was founded by Ramzan Khan (1759‚Äì1806). Sharafat was trained in classical music by his father, when he was still a child. When Sharafat was only eight years old, his apparent talent impressed the legendary Faiyaz Khan (1880 - 5 November 1950), who happened to be his maternal uncle,(Lalith J. Rao) Late Ustad Sharafat Hussain Khan ‚Äì Gone But Not Forgotten Agra Gharana - Agra School of Indian Classical Vocal Music, Retrieved 30 November 2019 during one of his visits to Atrauli. The maestro Faiyaz Khan had no sons. So he adopted Sharafat, and took him away to Baroda to train him in classical music as his heir. The vocal maestro of Agra gharana, Faiyaz Khan gave Sharafat Hussain Khan a chance to sing on stage after him and to continue singing where he himself had left off, when Sharafat was about 13 years old. The audience showed much appreciation to the young boy's singing talent. He also used to accompany Faiyaz Khan's singing in a supportive role playing the instrument called Tanpura in many concerts. Some music critics believe that Sharafat Hussain Khan deserved to get more credit for his singing talent than he actually did during his lifetime. Musical training Sharafat was only 20 years old, when Faiyaz Khan died. After his death, his maternal uncle Ata Hussain Khan started training him. Later Vilayat Hussain Khan of the Agra gharana became his father-in-law and continued training him. Sharafat Hussain Khan was a product of training by three classical music gharanas - Agra, Atrauli, and Rangile. Sharafat Hussain Khan was made an Honorary Fellow of the Performing Arts Academy of Uttar Pradesh.

The 22 room hotel, with its Art Deco facade, is located at 20, Place de la R√©publique, 27 miles due south of Le Mans. It is famous for its long association with the drivers, teams and cars of the Le Mans 24 Hours race. History The hotel opened for business in 1905, having been run by the Pasteau family for the past four generations, before a change of ownership at the end of 2013. From 1953, it was used as headquarters for Le Mans racing teams, most notably by teams managed by John Wyer. Wyer ran the victorious Aston Martin and Gulf Oil teams from the hotel, his first Le Mans victory, celebrated at the hotel, coming in 1959. As a consequence, the hotel is full of motor racing history. The garage to the side of the hotel and what is now a car park at the rear were used by mechanics to work on the race cars, which would then be driven on public roads to and from the circuit until the early 1970s. The hotel is a mecca for fans of the Le Mans 24 Hours race.http://www.classicandsportscar.com/blogs/james-elliott/hotel-de-france- my-new-must-visit-le-mans-related-monument The bar walls are covered with photos of past and present racing drivers, many of them signed by the drivers themselves.

Although originally postulated without self- interaction potential, the pressuron is also a dark energy candidate when it has such a potential. The pressuron takes its name from the fact that it decouples from matter in pressure-less regimes, allowing the scalar-tensor theory of gravity involving it to pass solar system tests, as well as tests on the equivalence principle, even though it is fundamentally coupled to matter. Such a decoupling mechanism could explain why gravitation seems to be well described by general relativity at present epoch, while it could actually be more complex than that. Because of the way it couples to matter, the pressuron is a special case of the hypothetical string dilaton. Therefore, it is one of the possible solutions to the present non-observation of various signals coming from massless or light scalar fields that are generically predicted in string theory.  Mathematical formulation  The action of the scalar-tensor theory that involves the pressuron \\\\Phi can be written as :S= \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\int d^4x \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{\\\\Phi} \\\\mathcal{L}_m (g_{\\\\mu u}, \\\\Psi) + \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa}\\\\left(\\\\Phi R-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi} (\\\\partial_\\\\sigma \\\\Phi)^2-V(\\\\Phi) \\\\right) \\\\right], where R is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric g_{\\\\mu u}, g is the metric determinant, \\\\kappa=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}, with G the gravitational constantNote however that it is different from the effective constant measured with Cavendish-type experiments (see also Scalar-tensor theory) and c the velocity of light in vacuum, V(\\\\Phi) is the pressuron potential and \\\\mathcal{L}_m is the matter LagrangianSee also Electroweak lagrangian and Quantum chromodynamics lagrangian and \\\\Psi represents the non-gravitational fields. The gravitational field equations therefore write :R_{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u}R= \\\\kappa~ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\Phi}}T_{\\\\mu u}+ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Phi} [ abla_{\\\\mu} abla_{ u} -g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\Box]\\\\Phi +\\\\frac{\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi^2}\\\\left[\\\\partial_{\\\\mu} \\\\Phi \\\\partial_{ u} \\\\Phi - \\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u}(\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Phi)^2\\\\right]-g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\frac{V(\\\\Phi)}{2 \\\\Phi} , and :\\\\frac{2\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)+3}{\\\\Phi}\\\\Box \\\\Phi= \\\\kappa \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\Phi}} \\\\left( T - \\\\mathcal{L}_m \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\omega'(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi} (\\\\partial_\\\\sigma \\\\Phi)^2 + V'(\\\\Phi) - 2 \\\\frac{V(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi}. where T_{\\\\mu u} is the stress‚Äìenergy tensor of the matter field, and T = g^{\\\\mu u} T_{\\\\mu u} is its trace. = Decoupling mechanism = If one considers a pressure-free perfect fluid (also known as a \\"dust\\"), the effective material Lagrangian becomes \\\\mathcal{L}_m = - c^2 \\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i \\\\delta(x^\\\\alpha_i), where \\\\mu_i is the mass of the ith particle, x^\\\\alpha_i its position, and \\\\delta(x^\\\\alpha_i) the Dirac delta function, while at the same time the trace of the stress-energy tensor reduces to T = - c^2 \\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i \\\\delta(x^\\\\alpha_i). Thus, there is an exact cancellation of the pressuron material source term \\\\left( T - \\\\mathcal{L}_m \\\\right) , and hence the pressuron effectively decouples from pressure-free matter fields. In other words, the specific coupling between the scalar field and the material fields in the Lagrangian leads to a decoupling between the scalar field and the matter fields in the limit that the matter field is exerting zero pressure. = Link to string theory = The pressuron shares some characteristics with the hypothetical string dilaton, and can actually be viewed as a special case of the wider family of possible dilatons. Since perturbative string theory cannot currently give the expected coupling of the string dilaton with material fields in the effective 4-dimension action, it seems conceivable that the pressuron may be the string dilaton in the 4-dimension effective action.  Experimental search  = Solar System = According to Minazzoli and Hees, post-Newtonian tests of gravitation in the Solar System should lead to the same results as what is expected from general relativity, except for gravitational redshift experiments, which should deviate from general relativity with a relative magnitude of the order of \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_0} \\\\frac{P}{c^2 \\\\rho} \\\\sim \\\\frac{10^{-6}}{\\\\omega_0}, where \\\\omega_0 is the current cosmological value of the scalar-field function \\\\omega(\\\\Phi), and P and \\\\rho are respectively the mean pressure and density of the Earth (for instance). Current best constraints on the gravitational redshift come from gravity probe A and are at the 10^{-4} level only. Therefore, the scalar-tensor theory that involves the pressuron is weakly constrained by Solar System experiments. = Cosmological variation of the fundamental coupling constants = Because of its non-minimal couplings, the pressuron leads to a variation of the fundamental coupling constantsNote that this is a classical effect, and it should not be confused with the quantum running of the coupling constants in regimes where it effectively couples to matter. However, since the pressuron decouples in both the matter-dominated era (which is essentially driven by pressure-less material fields) and the dark-energy-dominated era (which is essentially driven by dark energyIn the context of the pressuron, dark energy can either be a cosmological constant or due to a non-vanishing scalar potential V(\\\\Phi)), the pressuron is also weakly constrained by current cosmological tests on the variation of the coupling constants. = Test with binary pulsars = Although no calculations seem to have been performed regarding this issue, it has been argued that binary pulsars should give greater constraints on the existence of the pressuron because of the high pressure of bodies involved in such systems.

In this Upasana the sadhaka concentrates on Brahman (the Universal Self) in the cave of the heart. It is one of the thirty-two vidyas of the Upanishads taught in Vedanta, in which vidya Brahman is perceived as the imperceptible ether within the heart. This vidya occurs in the 8th Chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad. where it is taught that the abode of Brahman is the small lotus that is here in this city of Brahman, what is there in the small space within the lotus is to be searched out. This vidya explains the identity of the external and the internal, the objective and the subjective, the macrocosmic and the microcosmic, the universal and the individual, Brahman and the Atman. Significance In the Dahara-vidya, Brahman is to be conceived as dwelling in the cavity of the heart, and yet as big as the whole universe. Dahara-vidya has for its object the realization of the Atman in the little space (dahara ‡§¶‡§π‡§∞‡§æ) the subtle inner sky within oneself in the heart. It is a classical meditative practice mentioned in the Vedas. In this vidya the desires are the auspicious qualities of Brahman which are the objects of desire; the man who knows Brahman obtains, together with Brahman, all qualities of Brahman. Exposition Dahara-vidya is described in six brief passages in the Chandogya Upanishad. Sankara explains that for persons who have realized the unity of the Self, there is absence of the idea of 'traveler', 'travel' and 'destination', and on the cessation of the causes for continuance of the traces of ignorance etc. they merge in their own self; Brahman who is devoid of direction, location, qualities, movement, and differences of results, appears to people of dull intellect as non-existing, Dahara-vidya is taught to make them come to the right path. Therefore, the sage of Chandogya Upanishad insists that he (Brahman) who resides in the small space existing within the small lotus-like dwelling that is within the city of Brahman has to be enquired into (with the help of a teacher and other valid means). The space referred to within the heart is as vast as the space outside, within it are included both heaven and earth; whatever one has and whatever one does not have, all that is included in that space as also all beings and all desires. For those who have not realized Brahman the results acquired through actions get exhausted in this world and those acquired through virtues in the next. For those who have realized the Self there is freedom of movement in all the worlds. Then, whatever province he becomes attracted to, whatever objects he desires, that appears by his very desire, and being associated with that he becomes glorified. The sage tells us ‚Äì :‡§∏ ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§è‡§∑ ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§ø ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§§‡§¶‡•á‡§µ ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§π‡§∞‡§π‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§è‡§µ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§Æ‡•á‡§§‡§ø  :\\"This self which is such surely exists in the heart.

During his twenty-year career he appeared in thirty films and directed seven. Biography Joego was born in Makassar on the island of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies on 17 March 1907. He and his parents moved to Singapore, part of the British Straits Settlements, where he was raised. Joego did not receive much education. In the late 1920s Joego returned to the East Indies and became a member of the theatre troupe Dardanella, which was run by the Penang-born actor of Russian descent Willy A. Piedro and his native wife Dewi Dja'. Joego and the troupe, which included Andjar Asmara as the main script writer and actors such as Dja', Ratna Asmara, and Astaman, toured Southeast Asia. In 1936 it undertook a trip to India, hoping to produce a film version of Andjar's stage play Dr Samsi. Under financial duress, this plan collapsed, and Dardanella disbanded; Joego made his way back to the Indies and established his own theatrical troupe. Joego entered the film industry in 1940, when he and several former Dardanella members joined The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film (JIF) for the film Kartinah, which was directed by Andjar Asmara and starred Ratna and Astaman. Over the next two years Joego appeared in a further five films, all but one of which was for JIF or one of subsidiaries. His only appearance from the period in a non-JIF film was in Air Mata Iboe (1941), produced by the rival company Majestic. In the film, he depicted a man who becomes a robber and dies of guilt after his son is taken prisoner in his place. Joego (left) in Sri Asih (1954) During the Japanese occupation of 1942‚Äì45, Joego led two stage troupes, Batu Tjinta and Nusantara. He returned to cinema in 1948 with Djaoeh Dimata, in which he was cast alongside Ratna Asmara and portrayed a blind man who chases away his wife after fearing that she has been unfaithful. Joego appeared in one further film for the production company, South Pacific Film, the Andjar Asmara-directed Gadis Desa (1949). As the 1950s dawned Joego became increasingly involved in the film industry, though mostly behind the screen. In 1951 he directed his first two films, Penganten Baru for Tan & Wong Bros. (a joint venture of the Tan and Wong brothers) and Marunda for Persari (under the direction of Djamaluddin Malik). The latter film depicted a love triangle set against the Indonesian National Revolution. Joego directed a further three films in three years, for various different companies. Although he ventured into filmmaking, Joego remained active as an actor. He appeared in six films between 1950 and 1954. In 1955, with the domestic cinema faltering, Joego ceased directing to focus on acting. He acted in a further ten films by the end of the decade. In 1963 Joego made his last film, Daerah Tak Bertuan. He died on 18 February 1970. Despite his twenty-year career he was ‚Äì according to the magazine Mingguan Djaja ‚Äì never famous. Filmography Altogether Joego acted in 30 films. He directed seven more, at times also providing the story. =Actor= * Kartinah (1940) * Noesa Penida (1941) * Elang Darat (1941) * Poetri Rimba (1941) * Elang Darat (1941) * Air Mata Iboe (1941) * Ratna Moetoe Manikam (1941) * Poetri Rimba (1941) * Djaoeh Dimata (1948) * Gadis Desa (1949) * Sehidup Semati (1949) * Harumanis (1950) * Kusuma Hati (1951) * Marunda (1951) * Pelarian dari Pagar Besi (1951) * Bintang Surabaya (1951) * Penganten Baru (1951) * Taufan (1952) * Bung Tempe (1953) * Djali-Djali (1954) * Sri Asih (1954) * Rela (1954) * Gambang Semarang (1955) * Oh, Ibuku (1955) * Puteri Revolusi (1955) * Melati Sendja (1956) * Daerah Hilang (1956) * Rajuan Alam (1956) * Bintang Peladjar (1957) * Gembira Ria (1959) * Momon (1959) * Holokuba (1959) * Titian Serambut Dibelah Tudjuh (1959) * Sepiring Nasi (1960) * Dilereng Gunung Kawi (1961) * Badja Membara (1961) * Daerah Tak Bertuan (1963) =Crew= *Marunda (1951) ‚Äì Director and story *Penganten Baru (1951) ‚Äì Director *Taufan (1952) ‚Äì Director *Bung Tempe (1953) ‚Äì Director *Djali- Djali (1954) ‚Äì Director, screenwriter, and story *Oh, Ibuku (1955) ‚Äì Director *Puteri Revolusi (1955) ‚Äì Director References Works cited    External links * Category:1907 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Indonesian film directors Category:Indonesian male film actors Category:Male actors of the Dutch East Indies Category:People from Makassar Category:20th-century Indonesian male actors Category:20th-century Dutch male actors Category:Indonesian male stage actors ","title":"Ali Joego"},{"id":"43431358","text":"Michael Clamp (born 26 December 1961) is a former New Zealand rugby union player.

He studied Art at the American University of Beirut, Beirut University College, and at the Corcoran School of Art. His art has been described as Middle Eastern Neo Pop-Art. He embodies the traits of a paparazzi, storyteller, and an epicurean. Marwan has the spirit of a global citizen but never forgetting his Middle Eastern roots. Translating this gift in his art and lifestyle to bridge the gap, which is evident now more than ever, between the East and West. Career Chamaa was a founding member of the ‚ÄúX-ism‚Äù movement while in university. This movement, which included a diverse array of ideologies, fashion styles and forms of expression, as well as visual arts, music, literature and film. The subculture is largely characterized by anti-establishment views of the academic structures in art and the promotion of individual freedom of expression. It was established in 1987 by four art students: Chamaa, Fadi Ghazzaoui, Abdallah Ghorayeb, and Haytham Jawhari. It laid the groundwork for their current artistic identity. From 1985 Chamaa has been painting using various forms, mediums, and techniques. In mid 2013, he had a solo show entitled \\"La Dolce Vita\\" at the Galerie Tanit, (Beirut, Lebanon). It was dubbed \\"Middle Eastern neo-pop art\\" by many critics. The exhibition comprised 12 paintings that flow from one canvas to the next to form a 21.60 meter (70 feet and 87 inches) mural. The collection is an illustrated narrative. At the end of 2013 he showed \\"Caramels, superheroes, fried eggs et chocolats\\", a series comprising two (191 x 405 cm) triptych paintings and one (240 x 185 cm) diptych painting. This exhibition was shown at Bel-Air Fine Art Gallery in Geneva and Gstaad, Switzerland. In 2015 Chamaa showed the series, ‚Äúunplugged‚Äù. It is partly based on photographs that Carlos Ren√© P√©rez took of New York City. P√©rez was Chamaa's neighbor in the East Village of New York City where he spent many years of his adult life. The images chosen for this series from P√©rez's collection speak intimately to Chamaa. They represent a snapshot of his old neighborhood and are a vignette of spots in and around the city he used to frequent. In September 2015, Chamaa was chosen by Selections Magazine to be among 50 emerging Arab artists. He created \\"The Tarboush Chronicles\\" a series that reiterates the importance of staying true to one's original identity. A 20 cm x 20 cm canvas of the series was displayed in the 2015 Beirut Art Fair. In November 2015 the series Ecstatic was exhibited, Chamaa again uses his surroundings as his muse as he sets forth two large paintings. Inspired by the likes of Vitaly Komar, Alex Melamid, Wang Guangyi, and Alexander Kosolapov who use communist propaganda symbols as a base to convey a message. However unlike those great artists Chamaa is not criticizing the communist drives but rather using the original propaganda posters of Chairman Mao Zedong the founding father of the People's Republic of China, as a backdrop to Lebanize his message. In the Spring of 2016, ‚ÄúChagrin d‚Äôamour ‚Äì the musical‚Äù series was exhibited.http://www.esquireme.com/content/15237-chagrin-damour-the-musical- is-coming-to-town The m√©lange of the Occident and Orient, as is typical in Chamaa's works is evident in this series. Vintage Western comic book covers as well as vignettes from famous pieces by Roy Lichtenstein are wittingly woven with 1940's - 1960's Arabic love song lyrics. Chamaa's choice to incorporate Lichtenstein as a backdrop to this particular series is a natural selection as a tribute to the pop artist, who since the beginning of his career, used comic books as subject matter in various of his early paintings. In July 2016, Mashrou3 Lulu (The Lulu Project) was presented. This series is about the adventures of Lulu Moppet, nicknamed Little Lulu, and her friend Thomas Tompkins, aka Tubby. The series is painted in the style reminiscent to the original ‚ÄúThe Little Lulu‚Äù comic strip covers. The series comprises two installations, one triptych and two large format paintings. This work by Chamaa depicts a playful and innocent adventure of Little Lulu and Tubby, incorporating other characters like Herg√©‚Äôs character Archibald Haddock and many hidden surprises. In late 2016, when asked about the doodles that he has created in-between series, Chamaa replied: ‚ÄúIn between projects and in the midst of creating and working on a series, I need to stretch my fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and especially my mind from the detailed and intense work I invest in my artworks. The results are usually city scenes with many random strokes in terms of color, direction, and emotion; I call this routine: shama-sutra.\\" In September 2017 \\"It's a fake\\" was exhibited at the Beirut Art Fair from the series ‚ÄúAna biddeh‚Äù (I want). Marwan Chamaa sets off to explore the idea of Arabicity and what that means in this day and age. The series ‚ÄúAna biddeh‚Äù shows that the only unifying factor in Arab society is the appetite for global consumerism and greed resulting in the loss of its true identity. In November 2018 Marwan had a solo exhibition at the Mark Hachem Gallery in Beirut Lebanon. ‚ÄúRETRO-PER-SPECTIVE‚Äù featured his various interpretations of pop culture through select pieces past and present. In Spring 2020, Marwan Chamaa created Cin-Cin Comics. Cin-Cin Comics is a biannual tongue in cheek comics-cover-paintings . The first \\"issue\\" is number 35, the reason for not starting with number 1 is personal according to Mr. Chamaa. Cin-Cin Comics uses existing comics elements, topics, and characters as a base to satirically emphasize the cultural, political, and social landscape. Most illustrations are from the mid 50s America, giving the paintings a retro look. Cin-Cin Comics, not always politically correct, is a highly collectible series. Each painting is around 80 cm x 110 cm (31.50 x 43.30 inch), painted usually in acrylic paint.

He was the inventor of the Kahn System, a reinforced concrete engineering technique for building construction. The Kahn System, which he patented in 1903, was used worldwide for housing, factories, office and industrial buildings. It was adapted by his brother Albert Kahn, an architect, for design and construction of industrial buildings. By 1939 Kahn's system was used in 134 US cities by 1939. His engineering system for building construction was adopted by builders in Africa, Europe, Canada, China, Brazil, and Mexico. In Yokohama, Japan, his system was used in an automobile factory. His unique engineering system of construction was used also in airplane plants, warehouses, docks, foundries, creameries, filtration plants, rubber factories, steel plants, silos, distilleries, smelters, and textile mills. Early life and education Kahn was born in M√ºnstereifel, Germany, March 8, 1874. He immigrated as a child with his family to the United States in 1880, entering at the port of Baltimore, Maryland, where they briefly lived. They continued to Detroit, Michigan, where he was raised. Kahn was six when he reached to Detroit. He had five brothers and two sisters. Their father Joseph (1860‚Äì1924) was a rabbi and ran a restaurant. Kahn helped in his father's restaurant business and sold newspapers. Their mother Rosalie was skilled in music and art. Kahn went to the Detroit Public Schools ,where he received his elementary schooling. He completed the normal four-year high school curriculum in three years. Kahn received his higher education at the University of Michigan, which his older brother Albert, an architect, helped finance. He received a Bachelor of Science and a degree of Civil Engineer in 1896. Career Upon graduating from U of M, Kahn worked as an engineering draftsman for the Union Bridge Company of New York. He worked as an engineer for both the United States Navy and then for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Kahn also worked for C. W. Hunt Company of New York. In 1900 Kahn took a position in Japan in the engineering, construction and maintenance of iron and sulfur mines. He worked there for two years. The Albert Kahn Building in Detroit, where Julius worked in fabrication designs Kahn returned to Detroit in 1902, joining Albert Kahn Associates, an architectural firm that his brother Albert had founded in 1895. Kahn's first assignment was in Ann Arbor for the University of Michigan. He worked on the new School of Engineering building in 1903 with key architect Ernest Wilby. He had to conduct tests to determine if certain materials were sufficiently strong to support the new building they were about to construct. In particular they wanted to use reinforced concrete for the building floor, to replace the traditional wood supports. Kahn had already worked with reinforced concrete with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. While he was working at the war college building in Washington, D.C., he thought of methods to improve the existing technology of old school reinforcement concrete. These new ideas were the basis of the steel production company which he later founded. Kahn understood the structural problems inherent in the experimental method of cement reinforcement used at the end of the nineteenth century. The main problem was slippage of the steel within the hardened concrete, which weakened the building. He experimented in the basement of his brother's house, where he developed a new type of reinforced beam called \\"the Kahn Bar\\". The straight steel beam was bent back some on the edges, making stress distribution \\"wings\\" that increased its tension strength. Kahn patented his invention in 1903, the first of more than 75 patents he gained. Kahn formed his own company to manufacture such beams, called Trussed Concrete Steel Company (Truscon). He was its president, but spent much of his time in the designing room. The headquarters of the company was in Detroit, Michigan and the factory was in Youngstown, Ohio. Kahn decided on Youngstown as an ideal factory location because his company could use steel that was produced in the local area, cutting down on shipping costs. Inventions Kahn continued to experiment and develop reinforced concrete construction, having at least 75 patented inventions related to this topic by 1934. Kahn's first patented invention was the \\"Kahn Trussed Bar\\", also called \\"The Kahn Bar\\" or \\"Kahn Bar System\\", patented in 1903. This was the main product of the Trussed Concrete Steel Company, although the company produced many prefabricated steel products, as well as complete buildings. Kahn's co-workers noted that he would stop what he was doing in order to write down an idea immediately, no matter what else he was engaged in. Truscon employees were encouraged to come up with improvement ideas to benefit the company and would be rewarded financially if their ideas were used. For example, David H. Morgan, a company employee, invented a new type of airplane hangar door. It was subsequently manufactured by Truscon and he was financially rewarded for his idea. Societies and positions Kahn belonged to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The society awarded him The Collingwood Prize for a paper he wrote in 1899 entitled \\"The Coal Hoists of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company.\\" He was the founder of United Steel Company in Wooster, Ohio, and chairman of Truscon Laboratories in Detroit. Kahn later also served as a director for Mahoning Bank and the First National and Dollar Bank. In 1927 he was elected a chairman of the Youngstown Chamber of Commerce grade elimination committee, and a director of the street car committee in 1928. He was the president of a realty firm in Detroit that was named after him. Kahn was an honorary chairman of the Allied Jewish financial campaign in 1930. He was also a member of several committees in metal-related industries. Kahn was a member of the proxy committee that opposed the deal of the merger of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company with Bethlehem Steel. Family The Kahn family, 1921 Kahn married Margaret K. Kohut, daughter of rabbi Alexander Kohut, on December 23, 1903. Margaret Kohut was born in Hungary in 1876, and her family immigrated to the US. The Kahns had three children: Gisela (1906‚Äì2000), Katherine Kay (1909‚Äì1954), and Julius Kahn Jr. (1912‚Äì2009). The children were all born in Detroit, Michigan. Julius Jr. studied medicine at Ohio State University. Later life and death Kahn was president of Truscon from its inception in 1905 until 1935, when it was taken over by Republic Steel Corporation. He became a vice president for Republic, serving until 1939. Kahn retired \\"to private life\\" in 1939, which lasted one year. In 1940 he came out of retirement and became an executive of another steel fabricating company. Kahn died 4 November 1942 in Cleveland, Ohio, of pneumonia. Works Kahn wrote several engineering articles and some articles on the steel business. One article titled \\"Confidence and cooperation\\", discussed the ills of industry.

The company manufactured prefabricated products for reinforced concrete beams and steel forms for building reinforced concrete floors and walls. Kahn invented and patented a unique new technology reinforcement system of construction called the Kahn System that was stronger, more economical, and lighter than the existing old school technology used up to that point to construct buildings. The old method was to use plain straight smooth steel beams or loose rods or stirrups in concrete beams and floors. Kahn's new technology improved system used 45 degree tab flanges or \\"wings\\" permanently attached on steel beams that distributed the tension stress for overall improvement in strength of reinforced concrete. History Kahn founded in 1903 the Trussed Concrete Steel Company in a small Detroit building with a dozen employees for manufacturing the specially designed steel products for reinforcement in concrete beams and walls. Kahn became its first president. The company had its headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. The main manufacturing factory for the steel products was located in Youngstown, Ohio, after being in Detroit at first from 1903‚Äì1906. In 1906 a one-acre industrial site was developed in Youngstown at a cost of a million dollars. The new steel factory officially opened its doors for business in May 1907 with 100 employees. The Youngstown factory was developed because of its easy access to raw materials needed for steel production. The headquarters for Trussed Concrete Steel Company was located in Detroit at the northeast corner of Lafayette Boulevard and Wayne Street, in a new eight-story skyscraper built by Albert Kahn Associates in 1907. The building was the first office building in Detroit built from concrete and was later known as the Owen Building. The Packard automobile factory plant building number 10, originally designed in 1903‚Äì05, was the first time an automobile factory was constructed in the United States using reinforced concrete. Plant #10 in construction, c.1905 < = > Plant #10 blue print 1905 The full company name of \\"Trussed Concrete Steel Company\\" was difficult for the public so it was shortened to \\"Truscon\\". However, it did not officially change its name to Truscon Steel Company until 1918. Truscon produced their steel building materials including high ribbed steel forms for floors, ceilings, and walls. Kahn's new technology became a standard throughout the building industry. The company products had been used in over 15,000 structures worldwide by 1914. The factory developed derivatives from the initial Kahn Bar parent that the company was based on and manufactured these new steel reinforcement products from 1907 through 1914 for concrete construction of industrial buildings. The company expanded their product lines again in 1915 to include prefabricated buildings in kit form ready for assembly on site. It made products under the brand names of Hy-Rib, Rib Lath, Kahn Bars, Rib Bars, Rib Metal, and United Steel Sash. Kahn's system of reinforced concrete beams allowed for long span open floor room space, larger than could be provided using wood construction. This allowed solid-slab construction where shearing stresses could be maintained better. Large walls with few supports meant generous-sized windows could be installed on exterior walls to provide better natural sunlight and ventilation. This led to the design in factories known as the \\"Kahn Daylight System.\\" The company had a wide selection of steel products for reinforcement and prefabricated them to customer needs and specifications. Some products were collapsible column reinforcements, steel joists, and standardized steel forms. The company had several divisions. One division was Truscon Laboratories, based in Detroit. A 1924 maintenance book from Truscon gave instructions on how to maintain a large industrial building and illustrated their \\"graduate engineers\\" as white- coated scientists. Kahn, with his brother Albert, capitalizing on the compatible relationship between steel and concrete, exported their prefabricated products to European and Asian markets. Their products became the dominant prefabricated reinforcements exported to foreign markets between World War I and World War II, competing against French and Chinese products. The company had agent representatives in Central America, South America, Europe and Asia. The earliest British examples of the use of the Kahn system of reinforced concrete to build factories was in 1913 for the Arrol-Johnson Motor Company and the Albion Motor Car Company. The company developed a manufacturing factory about 1915 in Japan to manufacture its products for the Asian market. It eventually sold its interest to Mitsui Company in 1933. The company capitalized on its proprietary system for 20 years from 1903 and had much success in getting most of the market share worldwide. The Kahn Bar patent expired and others then developed non-proprietary systems of reinforced concrete. By 1930 the Kahn System of reinforced concrete became obsolete compared to more modern techniques of reinforcement that were more economical to manufacture. In 1937 the company was bought out by Republic Steel and Julius Kahn was vice-president of this new entity. Publicity It was discovered after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake most buildings were destroyed either by the earthquake or the aftermath fire, except those built with the Kahn System by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company. The engineering services of the company was specified in many cases upon rebuilding commercial buildings in San Francisco. The company received additional unintentional beneficial publicity when earthquakes occurred in Calabria in 1905, Messina in 1907, Jamaica in 1907, and the 1911 Philippines Mount Taal volcano eruption.

It made waterproofing liquid chemical products that went into or on cement and plaster. The products goals were to provide damp-proofing and waterproofing finishing for concrete and Truscon steel to guard against disintegrating action of water and air.  Description of water resistant products  From Truscon laboratories viewpoint waterproofing was considered methods and means of protecting underground construction like foundations and footings. It also pertains to structures intended for retaining water like water tanks and containing water under hydrostatic conditions like in water pipes, tunnels, reservoirs, and cisterns. Damp-proofing was considered the methods of keeping dampness out of the main part of concrete buildings. It involves the methods of treating exposed walls above ground level to avoid the entrance of moisture into the building. These definitions then qualified their various products as servicing particular needs. From the initial idea of protecting against water damage developed the science of integral waterproofing‚Äîthe introduction of some element into the wet cement during the process of making causing a high degree of impermeability and imperviousness. Water in masonry does harm structurally because of its solvent properties and because it expands when frozen breaking concrete. Water is observed into concrete walls like a sponge absorbs water through capillary action. A wet wall produces damp and clammy conditions that promote and spread disease. While structural damp-proofing and waterproofing to prevent decay was a motive of the Truscon laboratories chemicals, the side benefit was that it provided better hygienic conditions. Some of the products developed for damp-proofing was Por-Seal, Stone-Tex, Stone-Backing, and Plaster Bond. Water Proofing Paste, an ingredient used in the making of stucco cement and plaster, was developed for waterproofing. Another waterproofing product was named Water Proofed Cement Stucco.  Surface protection products  Truscon surface protection products and waterproofing usage Truscon's Agate waterproofing product ----- and ----- Truscon's Stone Tex concrete finishing Truscon laboratories waterproofing protection products were for residential housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, and manufacturing plants. They involved enamels and interior finishes. The products were coatings to provide a dustless waterproof washable surface for cement floors and walls. The Truscon laboratories slogan was Waterproof is Weatherproof. Some of the brand names of these specialized products were Asepticote, Sno-Wite, Industrial Enamel, Hospital Enamel, Dairy Enamel, Floor Finish, Edelweiss and Alkali-Proof Wall Size. Its Asepticote waterproofing product was used in houses, hospitals, and hotels for its eye-soothing finish. Truscon's \\"Waterproofing Paste\\" was an integral part of cement and used in floors, plaster, and stucco to waterproof walls and floors. \\"Industrial White\\" was used in the interiors of mills and factories because of its white brightness qualities. Truscon's \\"Granatex Floor Varnish\\", a stain-resistant product, was a transparent waterproofing agent that was used on concrete and wood floors. Truscon's Agatex was a chemical that hardened cement floors that was popular. It was a wet liquid that was applied on the surface of concrete like a paint or varnish. The product interacted with concrete and its dust chemically to resemble that of agate resulting in a hardened dustless surface when dry. The company claimed that the resultant treated surface was so hard that it would ring under a hammer like an anvil. Truscon's \\"Stone-Tex\\" product was used on all kinds of masonry building exterior walls as a water-resistant protective coating. It was used on concrete blocks, cement walls, stucco and brick. It was also used for making the building more attractive looking. Some of the thousands of Truscon laboratories product users were The Cincinnati Enquirer, American Tobacco Company, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Atlantic Petroleum, Haynes Automobile Company, Pennsylvania Railroad, E. W. Bliss Company, United States Military Academy, United States Marine Barracks, United States Shipping Board, Ferry-Morse Seed Company, Lowell Mills, Arlington Mills, H. J. Heinz Company, Dow Chemical laboratories, Winterhaven Citrus Growers' Association, Savage Arms, Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, Liggett-Myers Tobacco Company and Sinclair Oil Corporation. St Johns County School District on Fullerwood Grade School building. Buildings that used Truscon's products were the Packard automobile factory plant building number 10, Highland Park Ford Plant, Fisher Building, Fisher Body, Frederick Stearns Building, Youth's Companion Building, Midland Packing Building, Majestic Theater (Detroit, Michigan), Beech-Nut, Waco High School, Kalamazoo Paper, Detroit Crosstown Garage, Pennsylvania Rubber Company building, Minneapolis High School, Detroit Athletic Club, Detroit News building, and Milton Bradley building.  Iron and steel protection products  Truscon laboratories iron and steel protection products were for priming structural steel like in structures iron industrial building frames, factories, bridges, viaducts, stacks, and boilers. They were also used with brewing coils, ice making coils, fireproofing, and acid-proofing. These paint on products were waterproofing and rust preventing agents. Many of these products went under the brand name of Bar-Ox and were given numbers that related to specific applications. Examples were Bar-Ox No. 7 for coating on exposed structural steel, Bar-Ox No. I4 for brine and condenser pipes, Bar-Ox 21 for stack enamel and boiler front enamel, Bar-Ox No. 28 for acid-proofing, Bar-Ox No. 35 for guarding against alkaline conditions, Bar-Ox No. 42 for conduit coating, and Bar-Ox No. 49 for gas holder tanks.

It is an engineering reinforcement system for floors, walls, and ceilings of buildings and houses. This product is a derivative of the Kahn Trussed Bar for beams and columns that was invented by Julius Kahn. Kahn engineered the Hy-Rib products and they were first manufactured in 1909. Hy-Rib is a steel encasement stiffened by rigid ribs used in reinforced walls, ceilings, and floors. They are helical hooping units of steel sheathing forms used in concrete, stucco and plaster. Hy-Rib products are a derivative of the \\"wings\\" used in the patented Kahn System of reinforced concrete, invented by Julius Kahn in 1903. The products are made from a single plate of steel. Hy- Rib products were used in concrete doors, ceilings, and roofs. It was also used in sidings, partitions and ceilings to eliminate channels. Hy-Rib products were designed to take on plaster and cement to eliminate layout forms in the construction of buildings. The steel sheet form would be embedded with plaster or cement directly and would flow into the lath surface to attach itself to the steel and harden to secure the material into the steel.  Description and Application  Hy-Rib products came in steel sheathing forms that could be bent, cut and connected together to make various size floors, walls, and ceilings. They were designed with the idea to reduce weight as compared to wood structures of the same building size. The steel forms of sheathing were stiffened by rigid high ribs and a complete unit was made with a single sheet of steel. This technique increased floor space because it cut down on center posts that were normally used in wood structured buildings. The Hy-Rib reinforced concrete floors, ceilings and walls were fireproof, being a major safety factor over wooden structures. The Packard automobile factory plant building number 10 is a demonstration of Hy-Rib product application of this reinforced concrete technique. This was the first time reinforced concrete products were used for automobile factory construction. Hy-Rib products are used in the construction of tunnels, conduits, flumes, culverts, silos, cisterns, chimneys, and water tanks. For these applications the lath sheet products come in curved steel sheets. They are locked together to form a complete tube or tunnel on site. The curved sheets are stood on edge in the case of silos, water tanks, cisterns, and chimneys. The connected form then is plastered with cement. In some cases a few steel rods are added for extra strength and connecting purposes. Hy-Rib products are used in flooring due to its ability to interlock prefabricated pieces. It has plaster applied to the underside creating the ceiling. The top would have wet cement poured on it to form the floor above. If the floor were required to carry heavy loads the Hy- Rib sheathing material could be bent into an arch to provide additional strength and then wet cement could poured as usual on top to make a floor.

The Kahn system is an industrial construction design using the Kahn Trussed Bar as the bases. This steel bar was a new type of reinforcing bar used in concrete and had unique engineered features to distribute stress. Kahn saw problems with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction at the end of the 19th century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would break adhesion. The main reinforcing bar had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the reinforcing bar beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength. Description A reinforced beam bar in the early 1900s consisted of a plain straight steel in the center of a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The plain straight steel was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced beam bar. But in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting. Kahn discovered that concrete was much stronger in compression than tension, so devised the idea of distributing the stresses. He did scientific engineering experiments and created the concept that if the steel beam edges were bent back at a 45-degree angle forming projecting tabs or \\"wings\\" before going into the molded form led to better stress distribution. The winged sheared members are cut and turned up to form an angle from the thin edge of the steel bar but are still permanently attached. When the wet concrete mixture was poured and hardened there was no slippage of the steel beam because the tension stress is distributed throughout the beam. This new style constructed steel beam was called \\"the Kahn trussed bar\\", sometimes shortened to just \\"the Kahn bar\\". The trussed steel bar had bent-up \\"wings\\" on each side. The \\"wings\\" on the steel bar provided 20‚Äì30% additional strength to a reinforced concrete beam over the old technology of plain straight smooth steel bars or rods. The primary concept of the Kahn bar was that it gave reinforcement in both the vertical and horizontal plane while it simplified construction. The principal lines of shear stresses in a beam average a 45-degree angle, so the angled \\"wings\\" transmitted the tension down to the main reinforcing steel beam. The Kahn bar is of high grade steel with an elastic limit of 42,000 pounds and tensile strength of 70,000 pounds per square inch. Kahn formed his own company in 1903 called Trussed Concrete Steel Company (aka \\"Truscon Steel Company\\") located in Youngstown, Ohio, to manufacture these special steel bars used in reinforced concrete beams. Another new engineered innovation of Kahn was steel forms built with \\"ribs\\" instead of \\"wings\\". It was a derivative from Kahn's 1903 patent. This advanced technology was marketed by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company with the brand name of Hy-Rib products. The Kahn System of reinforced concrete is the first time an automobile factory was constructed; it was for Packard automobile factory plant building number 10 designed in 1903‚Äì05. The Kahn system of reinforcement products had been used in over 1500 buildings in the United States by 1907. Kahn trussed bar applications Kahn's patented invention is a steel bar of 45-degree diagonal \\"wings\\" as several minor members that are rigidly attached to the main member. The idea of the \\"wing\\" technique is that the stresses are distributed throughout the main reinforced beam. The steel then doesn't slip within the hardened concrete.

Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The East Lycoming School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. East Lycoming School District failed to participate in the State School Safety grants programs which provide local funding to promote school safety and the State School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant which pays the salary of a police officer in the school. Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees, 2014 Wellness policy East Lycoming School Board established a district wellness policy in 2010. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. Hughesville Junior Senior High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. East Lycoming School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available at Hughesville Junior Senior High School to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Extracurriculars East Lycoming School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. In cases where the student is failing more than one course with a credit value of .5 or greater or one course with a credit value greater than 2.0 at the end of the marking period, the student is ineligible for twenty school days for the next grading period. Students being pulled out of classes for band and/or chorus lessons must have at least a 75% average in that class to be allowed to go the lesson/practice. The district is compliant with state law, by posting its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. The sports programs are through the Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. The Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference is a voluntary association of 25 PIAA High Schools within the central Pennsylvania region.

The Hussars were a distinctively dressed light cavalry of East European origin. The 10th Hussars were stationed from 1814 to 1884 in Aschersleben and after 1884 in Stendal. They fought in 1866 at the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz and later in World War I.

On 25 May 1814, the regiment's former militia status was cancelled and it was designated the 10th Hussars Regiment (1 Magdeburg), also popularly referred to as the Green Hussars from Aschersleben, and transferred to active status in the Prussian Army. The regiment was assigned to Aschersleben as a garrison. At the time of the reform of the army under King William I on May 7, 1861, the regiment already held its final name of 10th (Magdeburg) Hussars Regiment, in German (Magdeburgisches Husaren Regiment Nr. 10). The regiment took part in the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz as part of the IV Corps of the First ArmyPerello, Christopher. \\"Koeniggraetz: Austria vs. Prussia, 1866\\", in Strategy & Tactics, no. 275 on 3 July 1866 when the Prussians defeated the Austrian Empire. Between 1866 and 1870, a fifth squadron was established. The regiment was relocated to Stendal in 1884, and in 1905 it could move into a newly built barracks. =Formation of the Elbe National Hussar Regiment= Prussian left On October 17, 1813 Senior Inspector (Amtsrat) Breymann of Anhalt-Bernburg and other patriotic former Prussian officers submitted an appeal to King Friedrich Wilhelm III. They wanted to form a volunteer hussar regiment. On the 28 of October the officers gained the final approval of the king. By a Supreme Cabinet Order (Allerh√∂chste-Kabinetts-Ordre) (A.K.O.) the establishment of the regiment was ordered for 19 November 1813. The uniform was determined by the military government of Halle/Saale. Each volunteer who joined the \\"Green Hussars\\" had to supply a horse to the regiment from his own resources. Those who could not had to pay at least 25 Thalers. Amtsrat Breymann put 20,000 talers at the disposal of the regiment. The plan was a regiment consisting of four squadrons with 150 horses each. Three of these squadrons were to be organized in Aschersleben, and the fourth one in Salzwedel. These squadrons were also formed relatively quickly, since the Green Hussars had a brisk flow of recruits, so that after a short time the establishment of the unit was completed. On November 25, 1813, 324 volunteers had already assembled, and at the end of year the Aschersleben squadrons were complete. Rittmeister Wilhelm von Breymann was appointed as interim commander. By a cabinet order of 20 February Major August Ludwig von Ledebur of the Garde du Corps was appointed regimental commander. At this time the regiment numbered 750 volunteers. After its complete outfitting with English arms, the regiment reported itself ready for action on April 1, 1814. A short time later it had already participated in the siege of Magdeburg. =1814= Elbnationalhusaren 1813‚Äì1815 Prussian light cavalry Uniform colour plate by F.Neumann around 1850 The newly formed regiment had its first test in the operation in front of Magdeburg. The regiment was organized into five squadrons of hussars and two of j√§gers. The two j√§ger squadrons found themselves in February 1814 along with other Prussian troops in front of the city, which was still held by the French. In the morning of April 2, the French pushed back the two squadrons and the other outposts. The villages on the highway from Magdeburg to Halle were all occupied by French troops. Now more Prussian troops, among them the five Aschersleben hussar squadrons, were alerted. They managed to expel the French from the villages and take some prisoners. In addition, the Aschersleben squadrons took a share in the further siege of Magdeburg. After the abdication of Napoleon on 6 April 1814, it was not until 27 April 1814 that the city of Magdeburg was surrendered by the French. The Elb National Hussar Regiment then marched into the city. The two j√§ger squadrons were then disbanded and the rest of the regiment again withdrew into garrison. In June 1814, the regiment was assigned to Westphalia, where it came under the command of General von Tauentzien. It was stationed in the area of Minden, Ravensberg and Lippstadt. Later it moved to the neighborhood of H√∂xter and Herford. From November on, the regiment was located in the Kingdom of Saxony. The 5th Squadron was transferred to Cuirassier Regiment No. 8 in April 1815. The transfer of the regiment to the standing army followed on 25 May 1815 and it then received the name 10th Hussars Regiment (1 Magdeburg). =1815= After Napoleon's renewed seizure of power in France on 1 March 1815, the mobilization of the hussar regiment followed on 15 April 1815, which was assigned to the reserve cavalry of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia as part of the IV Corps, under the leadership of General of Infantry B√ºlow. The Prussian corps marched through Wetzlar and Koblenz into Belgium. On 14 June 1815, the IV Corps was ordered by Field Marshal Prince Gebhard von Blucher to march from Liege, twenty miles westward to set up new headquarters at Hannut. Bulow however failed to detect the need for haste and failed to obey the order until the morning of the 16 June. As a result, he did not arrive in time to receive a second urgent order commanding him to continue his march westwards to join the rest of the Prussian army in battle on 16 June, when the Prussian I, II and III Corps met the French army at Ligny. Bulow's IV Corps was noticeably absent. It was not until 17 June at Gembloux, that the fresh IV Corps met up with Thielmann's retreating, but intact, III Corps moving from Ligny to the rallying point at Wavre. The 10th Hussars along with two battalions and two guns commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel von Lebedur formed the rearguard of the IV Corps, They reached the village of Mont-Saint-Guibert without enemy contact and took up positions to defend the defile with the 3rd and 5th Squadron forming the most advanced outposts. The 14th brigade of Bulow's IV Corps was positioned three miles south east of Wavre at Vieux Sart while the bulk of the IV Corps camped at Dion le Mont further to the East. By around midnight on the 17/18, Bulow's IV Corps had received orders to march at dawn (around 0400) to Chapelle-Saint-Lambert. where if battle had commenced between the Allied Forces and Napoleon's army, they would \\"vigorously attack the enemy's right flank\\". The 10th Hussars however, together with 2 infantry battalions and two guns were ordered to remain in position and hold the defile of Mont St Guibert against any French cavalry trying to cross the River Dyle. Thus the regiment was not engaged in the Battle of Waterloo. Nevertheless, there were some losses: three sergeants, 18 Hussars and 28 horses. The reserve cavalry later received orders to maintain the connection to the 1st Army with a battalion and to push forward to Paris. On 1 July, they crossed the Seine and camped at Versailles. After the armistice with France on 9 July 1815, the Allied troops entered Paris. The duties of the regiment were to disarm the National Guard and maintain order. The march back followed at the beginning of November, and on 28 December, Aschersleben was reached. For their behavior during the fighting Captain von Hagen, a sergeant and four hussars were awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. The 2nd Squadron was assigned Egeln and Tarthun as temporary quarters and the 4th Squadron received Cochstedt, B√∂rnecke and Schneidlingen. The 1st and 3rd Squadrons were again housed in Aschersleben. =1816‚Äì1866= In 1816, in appreciation for outstanding service against the armies of Napoleon, the 10th Hussars received the distinction of a gold-embroidered regimental flag. Furthermore, the same year the 2nd Squadron was transferred to Aschersleben and the 4th squadron went to Oschersleben as a garrison for the fortress, which is the present castle of Oschersleben. On 10 March 1823, the regiment officially received the name \\"10 Hussar Regiment\\", while the addition \\"Magdeburg\\" was lost. During the years of peace around 1827, Captain Thadden applied himself to intensive improvements in Aschersleben and the vicinity, and was consequently named the first honorary citizen of the town. When a devastating flood struck the town of Aschersleben in 1830, many people were saved by the efforts of the hussars. As of 1843, Wilhelm, the reigning Duke of Brunswick, was appointed by King Frederick William IV as honorary commander of the regiment. In 1845, the light blue markings on the caps and uniforms, as well as the inner lining of the furs, were changed to \\"pompadour\\" red. To restore internal order and security, the regiment was sent to Magdeburg during the 1848 March Revolution. After the revolutionary uprisings in the Electorate of Hesse, the regiment marched to Hesse in 1850 under Prince Radziwill without the affair coming to fighting. In 1860, the addition \\"Magdeburg\\" was again applied to the 10th Hussar Regiment. In 1862 the town of Aschersleben established a canteen in the existing armory, which later became the officers' mess. The city henceforth felt itself closely associated with its Green Hussars, and so in 1863, a grand celebration was held in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the regiment's stationing in Aschersleben. When war came between Prussia and Austria in 1866, the hussars marched out with the strong sympathy of the population. Under Colonel Besser the regiment distinguished itself in the battles of M√ºnchengr√§tz, Gitschin, K√∂niggr√§tz and Pressburg. After this campaign against Austria, the regiment was solemnly decorated on 3 March 1867 with the 'Ribbon with the Memorial Cross'. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, the regiment participated in numerous skirmishes (Wissembourg, Woerth and Spichern). In the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, it made a charge at Vionville. When the German troops had surrounded Paris, the regiment was assigned to the besieging troops. On 20 June 1871, the hussars returned to Aschersleben. Until its disbanding on 15 June 1882 and transfer on 12 December 1882 to the 13th Hussars, the first squadron of the regiment was led by Captain Gerd von Rundstedt, the father of the later Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt. In 1884, the regiment was relocated to Stendal. In 1900, members of the regiment were assigned to the East Asian Expeditionary Corps in China during the Boxer Rebellion. A detachment of the regiment likewise strengthened the German troops in German South-West Africa in 1903‚Äì1904 in response to the uprising that had broken out there. =1914‚Äì1920= Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich the Younger, chief of the regiment In the mobilization of July 1914, the regiment was increased to six squadrons, and divided into two half regiments of three squadrons each. After initial skirmishes in the area of the Belgian border, the hussars advanced into the interior of the country and took part in the capture of Brussels on 20 August 1914. During the general forward movement of the German army, the regiment reached the Marne river, but beginning on 9 September, it had to be withdrawn back along the Aisne to Soissons. Subsequently, the regiment took part in the so-called \\"Race to the Sea\\", then already from mid-October 1914, chiefly without giving up its horses, it was employed in trench warfare. The units of the regiment spent the whole year 1915 on the Western Front in the zone of the IV Army Corps. In 1916, the half regiments were again dissolved and the individual squadrons distributed among infantry divisions, where they fulfilled their original function of reporting and reconnaissance. The year 1917 brought the loss of the regiment's horses and its conversion to a Cavalry Rifle Regiment. The 3rd and 6th Squadrons had previously been moved temporarily to the eastern front, however. There the hussars fought in eastern Galicia, Bucovina and the Carpathians. In 1918, the individual squadrons fought, distributed among different infantry units, in the defensive battles on the Western Front. In December 1918, the remnants of the regiment arrived in their garrison city of Stendal, where the 1st, 3rd and 5th Squadrons were disbanded in February 1919. The 2nd and 4th Squadrons were converted to volunteer squadrons, which were to fight in Upper Silesia against Polish insurgents. This was not necessary, however, and the two squadrons were again dissolved in 1920. In the Reichswehr, the 3rd Squadron of the 3rd (Prussian) Cavalry Regiment in Stendal took over the regimental tradition. =Uniform= The Magdeburg hussars wore a dark green atilla with yellow lacing and a fur busby of sealskin with a pompadour-red bag of cloth. The cap had a brass chin-strap and a loose bandeau on the front with the inscription: Mit Gott f√ºr K√∂nig und Vaterland (With God for King and Country). There was also a white bandoleer with a black cartridge case, sabretache and lance. The lance pennons of the soldiers were black and white, those of the NCOs white with a black Prussian eagle. The field-gray field service uniform (M 1910), already ordered by an A.K.O. on 14 February 1907 and introduced gradually from 1909/1910, first replaced the colored uniforms on the occasion of the Imperial maneuvers of 1913. The peacetime uniform was exactly the same as the old ones, except that the laces stayed gray. The leather equipment and the boots were natural brown, and the fur cap was covered by a fabric case in what was called reed-color. The bandoleer and cartridge case were no longer used with this uniform. =Inclusion in the Prussian army march Collection= Since 1843, the regiment has been represented in the army march collection with march No. III, 32: \\"Trotting march of Hussar Regiment 10\\" which was composed by F. M√ºnter. M√ºnter was staff trumpeter of the regiment from 1841 to 1871, to which he presented this trotting march in 1843. M√ºnter engaged several times in composing for his regiment and after leaving the service, he worked as a music director in Aschersleben. Certainly Wilhelm Wieprecht as a native Ascherslebener contributed to his becoming known and inclusion in the army march collection. Until 1914, Field Artillery regiments 35 in Deutsch-Eylau and 54 in K√ºstrin used the march when trotting on parade. The military music historian Joachim Toeche-Mittler (1906‚Äì1996) described the piece as \\"a magnificent rhythm for official use\\".

The film stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Ulrich Thomsen, Maria Bonnevie, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Lykke May Andersen. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.  Plot  Police detective Andreas and his partner Simon are called to investigate an argument in a junkie couple's badly rundown flat, where they discover a child in a wardrobe lying in its own excrement. The seven-week old child Sofus is dirty and hungry but after he has been examined by Social Services they realize he is in good health. Because of that he cannot be taken from his parents Tristan and Sanne, despite the fact that they are well-known drug addicts. Andreas himself has a seven-week old child called Alexander with his wife Anne. They love him dearly and he's well looked after, but he is not an easy child. Soon Anne is unable to cope with Alexander because of her own mental instability. One early morning Andreas wakes up with Anne crying and a dead Alexander. A distraught Anne threatens to kill herself should Andreas call an ambulance - who'd take Alexander from her. After he has calmed down his wife and convinced her to take sleeping pills, Andreas takes the dead baby to the hospital. Waiting in the hospital's parking lot, he then decides to swap the babies and breaks into Tristan and Sanne's flat, where the parents are sleeping off a high. Anne is distraught. She refuses to accept the baby Andreas brings, as her own. The next morning Tristan notices that Sofus is dead. Sanne tells her husband that the dead baby isn't her son. Tristan fears that he and Sanne will go to prison and takes their stroller to a busy street, where he pretends that someone has abducted his child from it. Andreas and Simon, who are ordered to investigate, repeatedly interrogate Tristan and Sanne concerning the whereabouts of the dead baby (Alexander). Anne seems to have come to terms with the new situation. On one of her nightly walks she parks the stroller in the middle of the road on a bridge. This forces a trucker to stop. After she convinces him to take the baby and keep it warm in his cabin, she jumps into the freezing river, committing suicide. In the wake of Anne's death Andreas and his mother care for the baby (Sofus). In ensuing interrogations, Andreas and his partner try to get Tristan to talk. Andreas slips up when he calls the baby ‚ÄúAlexander‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúSofus‚Äù. After Tristan is told that Sanne has testified and that they'd have to find the baby to prove cot death, he comes clean. Andreas reacts with an outburst of rage, hitting and kicking Tristan, whereupon his superior sends him home and orders a meeting with the police psychologist. Tristan leads the police to a remote area in a forest, where he buried the baby. Sanne has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. She insists that the dead baby wasn't Sofus. At Alexander's autopsy it is revealed that he died due to a cerebral haemorrhage caused by shaken baby syndrome and that he had several older bleeds and rib fractures. Andreas realizes that Anne is responsible for the maltreatment. In a knee-jerk reaction, he heads for his mother's holiday home with Sofus. Meanwhile his police partner Simon has figured out that Andreas must have swapped the babies. He looks for him at the holiday home and gets it across to Andreas that to turn himself in, is the only right choice. He'd be dismissed from his job in law enforcement but be let-off on a suspended sentence because of significant mitigating circumstances. Andreas takes Sofus to the psychiatric clinic and returns him to Sanne, who is overjoyed. Some years later Sanne goes shopping at a hardware store, where Andreas works after leaving the police. When she leaves the child alone for a moment, Andreas talks to him and learns his identity.

ELLE reviewed her first novel, Front Row, as \\"Has all the juice of a Jackie Collins plus the kind of fash pack details that Armstrong, as fashion features director at Vogue, knows all about.\\" In contrast, the Birmingham Post thought it was amusing, affectionate and indulgent, and the Daily Mail called it merrily entertaining, saying Armstrong had \\"done for frocks what Jilly Cooper did for polo: made a gladiatorial social ritual into something witty and wicked, and mercifully without the embarrassing sex scenes or the excruciating puns.\\" Armstrong herself commented on Front Row: \\"It would've been hypocritical of me to do a complete annihilation job. I still work in that world and although it can be absurd and stupid sometimes I just found it funnier the more I observed and wrote about it.\\" Her other novels are Dead Stylish (2001), Bad Manors (2004) and D√©j√† View (2005).

During the proclamation of the Philippine Independence on June 12, 1898, Gliceria Marella Villavicencio was given the name \\"godmother of the revolutionary forces\\". Biography Gliceria Marella Villavicencio was born on May 13, 1852 in Taal, Batangas. She was the third child of seven children and the daughter of Vicente Marella and Gertrudis Legaspi. They were a wealthy family. At the age of 12 she attended the Santa Catalina College in Intramuros. When Gliceria's elder sister died, she had to take on the responsibility of managing the family estate. In October 1871, Gliceria married Eulalio Villavicencio, a wealthy ship owner, who also came from a rich family. Together, Eulalio and Gliceria contributed a large portion of their fortune and effort to reinforce the Philippine Revolution. Casa villavicencio, a house on the hill top, was gifted to her as a wedding gift by her husband. The house is used as a place for refuge and as a secret meeting site for revolutionary leaders. When the Spaniards found out about the couples revolutionary activities, their house was frequently searched by the Guardia Civil, where later Eulalio was arrested on charges of sedition and inciting rebellion. Gliceria pleaded in Manila for her husband's release. Gliceria was given the offer from the Spaniards of having her husband released from prison in exchange for any secrets. However, she refused the offer despite her love for her husband. Eulalio was later finally released in 1898, but died after 3 months due to his degraded health in February 1898. The death of her husband had inflamed her passion for supporting the revolution against the Spaniards. Gliceria Marella Villavicencio used up many of her wealth to extend material aid to the insurrectos . Out of the many she had given, the most notable was the donation of her Ship, the SS Bulusan, which was used in transporting Filipino soldiers, armaments, ammunition, and food supplies for the maintenance of the revolutionary forces. It was the first warship made available to the revolutionaries. She was a founder of the Batallon Maluya, gave financial and moral support to the revolutionaries and continually provided food, clothing and ammunition to the soldiers. Her house became the secret meeting place of revolutionary leaders including Andres Bonifacio, General Miguel Malvar and General Marasigan. Gliceria Marella Villavicencio died on September 25, 1929. She had six children.

History She was built in 1891, and purchased by the Ottoman government in 1913. During World War I, she served in the Ottoman navy, first as a mine sweeper and then as a coastguard vessel. After the end of the war, in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated, she anchored in Karadeniz Ereƒüli, a port on the western Black Sea. In the Turkish War of Independence In 1919, the ship was seized by the nationalists and beginning by 12 November 1920 she began serving as a military cargo ship to transfer artillery from the East Anatolia and Batumi to West Anatolia ports. The Allies naval ships tried to catch her. However, she managed to escape every time. Consequently, she was nicknamed the \\"ghost ship\\". Last two voyages On 17 July 1921 during her ninth voyage, while carrying two British made 88 mm guns and 354 ammunition boxes from Batumi, she was spotted by two Greek battleships. She could escape to Ordu, which was then a port without harbor facilities. The citizens of Ordu helped to unload the artillery before the Greek ship showed up and the captain Mahmut, who later adopted the surname G√∂kbora, shipwrecked R√ºsumat. To fool the chasers, he also set fire on the board. The Greek torpedo boat Dafni arrived; but seeing the fire they quickly left Ordu. After the fire was extinguished, the captain cleaned the ship, managed to float the ship, used hazelnut oil to activate the engines and sailed to Batumi for repairs. After repairs, she began her tenth and last voyage on 25 September 1921. She successfully reached Samsun port. But during her return voyage, she was spotted again and this time she was bombarded and sunk off Eynesil, Giresun Province.

The consortium was made up of producer Maurice Winnick, newspaper publisher Lord Kemsley, and the owner of Great Universal Stores, Isaac Wolfson. Their general manager was John McMillan, formerly Chief Assistant on the BBC's Light Programme. In October 1954, the ITA announced that Kemsley-Winnick had been successful in obtaining the initial franchises for weekend television in the North and the Midlands. The company collapsed in 1955, shortly after the award of the contracts, when Lord Kemsley's concerns about the potential financial exposure led to him withdrawing from the consortium. Disagreements with Winnick led to Wolfson also leaving. The departure of so many senior figures led the ITA to declare the company was now different to that which submitted the bid, and they re-advertised the contract. The contract was eventually awarded to ABC, who had previously been offered the 7-day Midlands contract, but ABC's board refused. After Kemsley-Winnick's collapse, ABC were awarded the North and Midlands Weekend contract on September 21st 1955, the day before ITV started broadcasting, and ABC started broadcasting the following year.

There is also no mentioning of transboundary impacts even though the site is just around 15 km from the Romanian border and even nearer to the River Danube.

It enabled connections on the branch line to in County Roscommon. The junction faced Ballymote and Sligo station and was a trailing junction in the Boyle and Dublin Connolly direction requiring a reversal. The station was not located near any significant settlement, the nearest, Gorteen in County Sligo being over 6km away. The station had three platforms: two served a passing loop on the main line and the third was used by the branch line. All main line trains usually used the island platform for easier transfers to the branch line. The station had sidings and turntable for turning round engines coming up from the branch line together with a loop for running the branch line train. There was a signal box and a house for the station master. History This railway station opened by the Sligo and Ballaghderreen Railway on 31 October 1874, becoming part of the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) in 1877. The MGWR was joined with other railways companies to form Great Southern Railway company in 1924 and with a further merger in 1925 the station came under Great Southern Railways. The station closed on 4 February 1963 with the closure of the branch line. The last passenger train back to Ballaghaderreen at 13:00 set off a large number of denotators set on the track to mark the departure. The passing loop has since been removed leaving the main line as single track. Only part of the island platform and the station masters' house remain. The embankment of the branch line is still visible from trains passing on the main line. Etymology Kilfree is the name of the civil parish covering both the location of Kilfree Junction and the area in County Sligo the branch line ran through. Kilfree is also the name of the townland where the parish church once stood, the townland location is near the R293 road some way from both Kilfree Junction and the route of the branch line. Incidents Kilfree Junction was the scene of several incidents in the Irish War of Independence including carriages containing members of the British Army being shot at and Royal Irish Constabulary officers being overpowered and disarmed in January 1921. On or about 8:00 am in June 1956 a freight train approaching downhill from Dublin North Wall to Sligo failed to halt at the signal box as directed and crashed through buffers at the end of a siding. The body of the year old diesel- electric locomotive A44 sheered off from the bogies, somersaulting three times over 25 yards and ending up 50 feet below on the mainline. The driver escaped with minor injuries and was discharged from hospital after one day. The 12 wagons were wrecked and contents spread over a large area. A cargo of gelignite was dealt with first, and cargo of carbide marked Dangerous when dry was handled next. The fate of remaining cargo including whiskey and stout does not appear to be recorded. Breakdown crews from Dublin, Galway and Athlone were rapidly on the scene with a breakdown crane and the wreckage quickly cleared. Locomotive A44 was subsequently repaired and returned to service.

Litigation and closure In December 2014, Tom Markusic's former employer Virgin Galactic alleged he had illegally provided Virgin intellectual property to the Alpha development team. Virgin also alleged that Markusic had \\"destroyed storage devices, disposed of computers, and reformatted hard drives to cover the tracks of his misappropriation of Virgin Galactic information\\". In August 2016, an independent arbitrator confirmed that Markusic had destroyed evidence. Thereafter, a major European investor backed down, leaving Firefly without sufficient money to proceed. The company furloughed its entire staff in October 2016. According to Markusic, the investor's drawback was not related to the litigation but to Brexit. Within the same month, Virgin Orbit filed suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Firefly and two of its officers. By 1 December 2016, Firefly Space Systems had permanently ceased engineering work.\\"Was a good place while it lasted\\" In March 2017, it was announced that \\"virtually all\\" of the assets of Firefly would be sold at auction, organized by EOS Launcher, Inc., who had previously bought a US$1 million promissory note issued by Firefly to Space Florida and induced a foreclosure. =Firefly Aerospace= After going bankrupt and being liquidated in March 2017, the company was re-created as Firefly Aerospace by Noosphere Ventures, who bought out the assets of former Firefly Space Systems.Once Grounded by Bankruptcy, Firefly Aerospace Appears Ready to Re-Launch The owner of Noosphere Ventures, Max Polyakov, committed to fully fund Firefly through at least its first two launches. The plans for engine development were significantly altered by the new management, and the revised Alpha vehicle features a pump-fed engine and removes the aerospike configuration.Firefly Re- Emerges With Upgraded Alpha Rocket Design The reorganization has delayed development by approximately a year, with the first launch expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.One of the young space firms that are sponsored by Max Polyakov is Firefly Aerospace Development of engines and structures has resumed and Firefly Aerospace has performed multiple hot-fire tests of its Lightning-1 second stage engine on its existing horizontal test stand. A vertical stage test stand is nearing completion and stage testing is expected to begin in the second half of 2018. On 17 May 2018, Firefly Aerospace opened a Research and Development (R&D;) center in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. The Firefly R&D; center was announced to become over time a place of work for more than 150 employees, and is equipped with the largest 3D-printer in Ukraine, intended for industrial manufacturing of high-quality metal parts.Firefly Aerospace Opens Research and Development Center in Dnipro, Ukraine - Firefly Aerospace On 10 October 2018, Firefly Aerospace and smallsat developer York Space Systems announced a partnership to offer customers a combined package of satellite and launch services.Firefly Aerospace and York Space Systems partner to provide integrated satellite solutions Jeff Foust, Space News. 10 October 2018.

Most individuals linked to the MLNV currently serving out their sentences in prisons of Spain, France and other countries were convicted for their involvement with Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) at the moment of their arrest, and for other offences such as murder, attempted murder, participating in terrorism and kidnapping. Some were convicted only for being a member of ETA, while others were not members of ETA but have been imprisoned for collaborating with it, or have been convicted of other offences such as belonging to illegal organizations like Gestoras pro Amnist√≠a or SEGI, belonging to or trying to rebuild banned political parties such as Askatasuna and Batasuna, participating in Kale borroka, or for the \\"public glorification of terrorism\\", an offence incorporated into the Spanish Criminal Code in 1995.http://riull.ull.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/915/3157/El%20delito%20de%20apologia%20del%20terrorismo..pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Many supporters of the Basque nationalist left consider ETA and MLNV convicts currently in Spanish and French prisons to be political prisoners, the majority of whom are represented by the Basque Political Prisoners Collective (EPPK under its Basque acronym). Some organizations like Etxerat have spent many years campaigning for the rights of Basque prisoners, with a special focus on bringing dispersed prisoners back to the Basque Country and the release of seriously ill prisoners. Since the late 1960s tens of thousands of MLNV activists have been detained, and several thousands of those imprisoned. Up until 2003 an estimated 30,000 activists had been arrested, 8,172 of whom were accused of being members of ETA, out of which 4,770 were convicted of a criminal offence and served a prison sentence. A notable convicted MLNV leader is former ETA-member Arnaldo Otegi, who was released in 2016 after six year in prisons for attempting to re-establish the outlawed party Batasuna, despite having received conviction in an unfair trial. In addition, Otegi had been previously convicted of a number of offences including kidnapping, glorifying terrorism, and being an ETA member. History The number of prisoners related to the Basque National Liberation Movement has varied over the years as can be seen in the following bar chart. It begins in 1978, after the amnesty of 1977, which made it illegal to bring to trial any Franco era crime, and also gave amnesty to all prisoners who had committed crimes with a political root during Franco's dictatorship and the Spanish transition to democracy. The data for the bar chart comes from Etxerat, the association of family members of these prisoners, and the EPPK (Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa). However, some prisoners choose not to be part of Etxerat, or have been expelled, and so the number of Basque National Liberation Movement prisoners is approximately 7% more than these figures. For example, in 2005 Etxerat reported 507 prisoners were held in Spanish prisons, while the Spanish prison service stated that there were 544 related to ETA. For consistency the Etxerat figures have been used in the bar chart.

Dispersal policy In 1989 the Spanish government began a policy of dispersal of Basque prisoners throughout Spain. The purpose was to restrict communication between ETA and its prisoners and to eventually reintegrate them into society. At the beginning some prisoners were even sent to North Africa and the Canary Islands, but during ETA's ceasefire in the late 1990s those prisoners were brought back to the mainland, and even after the ceasefire ended they were kept there. Several times prisoners have been brought nearer to the Basque Country as a response to an ETA ceasefire. For example, in September 1999, 105 prisoners were sent to prisons nearer the Basque Country in response to ETA maintaining its ceasefire for over a year. However, prisoners have also been sent further away in response to ETA violence. The policy has been maintained over the years, generally sending the more dangerous or high ranking individuals to prisons furthest from the Basque Country. 2014 marked the 25th anniversary of this policy, which has been hailed as a great success by the Spanish government, especially in the light of the 2011 declaration by ETA of a permanent ceasefire. France has taken a similar approach, spreading the prisoners throughout the French prison system. The families of the prisoners view this policy as punishing them, as they are forced to travel large distances to visit their imprisoned relatives. They argue that the distances they need to travel cause stress, is financially draining, and that every year there are accidents involving family members while traveling to or from prisons. There have been many demonstrations calling for all these prisoners to be moved to prisons in the Basque Country. Currently there is a highly publicised campaign calling for this. Its slogan is \\"Euskal presoak- Euskal Herrira\\" (\\"Basque prisoners to the Basque Country\\"). It has widespread support within the Basque Country. Ill prisoners also regularly ask to be transferred to prisons in the Basque country. Most of the main political parties in Spain reject this idea, the exception being Podemos which wants to see an end to the dispersal policy. Mariano Rajoy, the Prime Minister of Spain, said in 2011 that he would not consider ending the policy until ETA declares its disbandment. Interior minister Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az confirmed the possibility of changing the dispersal policy conditioned on ETA's dissolution. In 2017 this was re- emphasized by the Interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido who stated that the Spanish government would not end dispersion while ETA still exists. By contrast, the European Parliament condemned on 5 October 2017 dispersal policies applied within Europe for their damaging effect on prisoners' family life, as well as urging member states to revise the sentences of seriously ill prisoners on humanitarian grounds; the act, passed by a large majority (474 votes), was opposed by the Spanish Conservatives, Ciudadanos, and UPyD. However, in May 2019, the European Tribunal for Human Rights ruled against the appeal filed in 2016 by prisoner Gorka Fraile against his dispersal 700 km away from his family while undergoing cancer treatment; the tribunal stated that the dispersal policy is justified and sanctioned by Spanish law and interference with his family life would be justified by a higher end, i.e. \\"the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and liberties of others\\", concluding next that Spanish Justice did not breach his fundamental rights. In March 2018, Etxerat reported the death of prisoner Xabier Rey in a Cadiz prison cell, 1050 km away from home, who was held 1st degree, i.e. incommunicado. The relatives' support association condemned the harsh conditions of his detention. It was followed by a rally in Pamplona mourning and denouncing his death attended by thousands. Following ETA's disbandment [2017], a wide number of jurists consulted in Spain advocated for an end to the dispersal policy in May 2018; however, at that point, the Spanish government refused to change its policy on the matter. The topic of ETA prisoners was raised by Pablo Casado before and after his election in July 2018 as head of the Popular Party. The party used the victims of terrorism as a way of opposing the incoming Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez, PSOE, now in office, with Casado declaring they would \\"not put up with any prison transfer close home of ETA prisoners\\", and would not either accept \\"meddling with the memory of the victims\\"; the party secretary Javier Maroto stated that the party would rally ETA victims out to the streets to protest any attempt to transfer these prisoners close to the Basque Country. EPPK 2008 poster with all the prisoners' pictures demanding the release of \\"prisoners seriously ill and those with prison term completed\\" Placard in support of the Basque prisoners (San Sebasti√°n) Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa (EPPK) is a collective which speaks and negotiates for, and has as members the majority of these prisoners. Originally this role was played by La Comisi√≥n Pro Amnist√≠a and La Gestora Pro Amnist√≠a, both of which were dissolved after the general amnesty in 1978. In 1979 Gestoras pro Amnist√≠a was created to take their place. After this was made illegal in 2001 Askatasuna took on the role, but was itself made illegal in 2002. In 2008 twenty-one members who had run Gestoras pro Amnist√≠a were imprisoned for between 8 and 10 years each. In 2011 the former head of Askatasuna, Oihana Agirre was given a 12-year sentence. Since the illegalization of Askatasuna the EPPK and Etxerat have spoken for the prisoners and campaigned for amnesty to be granted to them. The EPPK is said to control prisoners strictly and demand they follow its orders. Prisoners who refuse orders from the EPPK have been ostracized. It is thought there are broadly 2 groups within the prisoner population. One group has long sentences yet to serve, who would prefer a group negotiation for amnesty. The other group consists of prisoners with less time to serve before being released, and they might be interested in applying for better conditions or for limited release. In 2012 the EPPK was criticized by former prisoners for insisting on amnesty for all prisoners and denying many prisoners the option of improving their own situation through other legal means. In December 2013 the EPPK announced that it was dropping its long standing demand for amnesty of all prisoners, and so opened the door for prisoners to negotiate individually for better conditions. However, in July 2014 it was reported that no member of the EPPK had begun individual negotiations, and it was believed that the EPPK was still following an alternative strategy. Hunger strikes There have been many hunger strikes by Basque prisoners. None have led to the death of a prisoner. Here is a list of some of them: * In June 1974 thirteen prisoners in Basauri prison began a hunger strike. It lasted 13 days. * In September 1974 one prisoner in Zaragoza prison took part in a 16-day hunger strike and was hospitalized. * In October 1974 thirteen prisoners in Basauri prison began another hunger strike. * In December 1974 six prisoners took part in a hunger strike in Zaragoza prison. * In September 1976 twelve prisoners began a hunger strike in Burgos prison to protest at the conditions of the prison and their treatment. * In December 1976 eleven prisoners began another hunger strike in Burgos prison. * In August 1977 seven prisoners from Carabanchel and Martutene prisons took part in a hunger strike. * In May 1978 nine prisoners held in Pamplona prison held a 17-day hunger strike.

After 23 days he was transferred to hospital. * In October 1998 four prisoners in La Sante prison in Paris went on hunger strike to protest against the planned extradition of one of them to Spain after completing his sentence in France. * In May 2000, 300 prisoners ended a 7-month-long hunger strike. * In August 2006 Jos√© Ignacio de Juana Chaos began his first hunger strike which lasted 63 days. It was to protest against him being accused of making terrorist threats in two letters written from prison just as he was about to be released after 17 years inside. In November of the same year he was given a 12¬Ω year sentence for writing those letters. In protest at the sentence he began another hunger strike which ended on 1 March 2007 after 114 days. He began his third hunger strike in July 2008 in protest at the Spanish authorities confiscating the apartment his wife had bought from his mother, and where he was planning to live on leaving prison. * In January 2010 Lorentxa Gimon began a hunger strike to protest against her isolation in the French prison where she was. It began before and independently of the mass hunger strike which began later in January. * In January 2010 there was a mass hunger strike by all 742 prisoners belonging to the collective of Basque prisoners (EPPK). It was to complain about the policy of dispersion. * In October 2010 six prisoners began a 15-day hunger strike in Murcia prison to demand that they all be kept in the same part of the prison, and to complain at the unhygienic conditions of the whole prison, including a plague of rats in the kitchen and dining room. * In February 2012 Ibon Goieaskoetxea and Borja Guti√©rrez began a hunger strike in protest of the imminent transfer of Goieaskoetxea to another prison in France. * In August 2012 a hunger strike was begun to protest at the Spanish authorities refusal to let Josu Uribetxeberria, an imprisoned ETA member who had terminal cancer, from returning home to die. It began with 100 prisoners in Spain, including Arnaldo Otegi, and they were joined by 91 from French prisons. By 13 August 254 prisoners had joined the hunger strike. * In October 2013 fifteen Basque prisoners in Seville prison began a hunger strike to protest against their incarceration so far from home and their families. Thirteen of the prisoners continued the hunger strike for 32 days. * In June 2015 seven prisoners held in Fleury-M√©rogis Prison went on hunger strike to protest at the reduction in the number of visits they can each receive, from four every month to two. * In May 2016 a hunger strike was held for 19 days by several prisoners in Fresnes prison in France in protest at Itziar Moreno being placed in isolation. 'Via Nanclares' 'Via Nanclares' is a project to allow ETA prisoners to gain better conditions in prison and eventually to be released on condition they fulfill certain conditions. The core of these conditions is that they distance themselves from ETA, ask for forgiveness, and agree to pay compensation for their actions. Its purpose is to break the control the EPPK (Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa) has over these prisoners and the strict discipline it imposes. Part of this discipline for example, demanded that amnesty of all prisoners was to be sought, and that individuals could not seek ways to reduce their own sentences. Anyone doing so would be ostracized. The 'Via Nanclares' project was thought up by Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba and set in motion by the then Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Zapatero in 2009. It takes its name from the old Nanclares de Oca prison in the Basque Country, where these prisoners were to be sent. In 2011 that prison was replaced by the new 720 cell Zaballa prison, built close to it. With the change of government in Madrid in November 2011 the 'Via Nanclares' was temporarily closed, but is now in use again. It requires prisoners to: * Distance themselves from ETA. * Accept prison policy. * Leave the collective of Basque prisoners (EPPK). * Publicly denounce ETA and the use of violence. * Ask for forgiveness from the families of their victims, if there are any. * Agree to pay compensation, if damage has been caused. * And lastly to collaborate with the Spanish judicial system in the fight against terrorism. When ETA declared its permanent ceasefire in 2011 twenty two prisoners had opted for this option. However, Mikel Buesa claimed that 68 prisoners had started the 'Via Nanclares' by 2012, with 30 managing to be sent to Nanclares prison. The first to be released through the 'Via Nanclares' were Jos√© Manuel Fern√°ndez P√©rez de Nanclares and Fernando de Luis Astarloa in 2012. Prisoners who have chosen this way to improve their conditions have all found themselves ostracized by the radical nationalist community they were formally part of. Many prisoners have been reluctant to pursue the 'Via Nanclares' for this reason. The 'Via Nanclares' was closed at the end of 2011 when the Partido Popular won the general election. The new government initiated a different project to rehabilitate prisoners, but only one person used it. In 2014 Spanish judges opened up the way for prisoners, who had been on the 'Via Nanclares' when the project was stopped, to continue the process. So far 3 have been given permission to leave prison during daytime, and a further 8 have been given permission to spend 18 days away from the prison in every 6-month period. The Parot doctrine In October 2013 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) condemned Spain over its continued detention of In√©s del Rio. She was due to be released in 2008 for good behaviour after 21 years in prison, but in 2006 Spain changed its rules to include what is now known as the Parot doctrine, and decided to postpone her release until 2017. The ECtHR declared that this was a violation of two articles (5 and 7) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered Spain to release her as soon as possible and to pay her compensation. The following day, on 21 October 2013, she was released from prison. The European court's ruling also banned the Spanish government from extending prison terms for Basque prisoners. The Spanish government complained that this ruling would mean they would have to release dozens of ETA prisoners. In November 2013 Spain began releasing other prisoners, including one being held temporarily in a prison in the UK. Ahead of the European Court of Human Rights' ruling, the minister of interior Fernandez D√≠az declared that its implementation to the inmates in similar circumstances may be skipped by means of \\"juridical engineering\\". The minister of justice Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n stated that \\"each inmate of Spain in similar circumstances will have to appeal to the European Cour if they want to have the Parot doctrine cancelled\\". There was a mass demonstration held in Madrid against the ruling by the ECtHR organised by the Association of Victims of Terrorism. Torture Generally speaking, torture almost always takes place in secret and so it is difficult to know if it has taken place or not. Members of the Spanish state apparatus have been convicted for mistreatment, torture and even murder of ETA members, the veracity of many torture allegations and the degree to which it occurs is subject to controversy in Spain. However, Amnesty International claims that torture is a reality in Spain; between 2004 and 2012 over 6,400 torture cases were reported, a figure in contrast to the number of convictions. Pau P√©rez-Sales, activist and senior expert assisting both domestic and international tribunals has stressed the degree of impunity surrounding torture in Spain.P√∫blico (1 February 2015). On 13 September 2017, Amnesty International stated that during a long period, citing a Basque Government's 1978-1999 report, torture was applied extensively in Spain under anti-terrorist provisions, affecting to a large extent the Basque Country, and demanded the Spanish government admit to its practice, as well as reminding it of its 'obligation' to investigate torture and make reparations to the victims. It also denounced Spain for continuing to evade the application of international standards against torture in its domestic legislation. In addition, it stated that convictions for torture are very infrequent, and highlighted the high number of pardons granted to the few people convicted of such crimes. The NGO also pointed out that torture victims are 'ostracized'. Between 1977 and 2002 there were approximately 5300 claims of torture having been carried out by police on ETA prisoners. Since then there have been hundreds more accusations. Allegations of torture are mostly related to threats and beatings, and then to lesser degrees to suffocation, forced body positions, undressing and physical exercises. A study of 112 Basques held incommunicado between 2000-2005, conducted by the Basque Institute for Legal Medicine and based on testimonies collected by an NGO, suggests that torture remains a serious problem in Spain. It detected different alleged torture patterns relating to different police forces. The group arrested by the Civil Guard accused this body of the most severe torture methods. In December 2018, the Spanish Parliament refused reparation and recognition to the victims of torture inflicted in the fight against ETA, or removing honour awards granted to members of the security forces convicted of torture; the proposal was turned down with the votes of the parties PSOE, Ciudadanos and PP. According to former ETA members, the French police never submitted their prisoners to torture. ETA terrorism never targeted French civilians nor security forces and France had a long-standing policy of tolerating ETA presence on its territory since the times of Franco's dictatorship. This policy changed in the late 80s when French President Mitterrand decided that France would no longer be an ETA 'safe-haven' and began co-operation with Spanish authorities and extradition of ETA-members indicted for terrorism to Spain. =Torture cases and convictions= One example of an alleged incident is that of Martxelo Otamendi, the editor of a Basque language newspaper Egunkaria which was subject to a precautionary closure in 2004 by a Spanish judge due to alleged links with ETA, later found to be ungrounded. Otamendi, among other editors was arrested by the Guardia Civil as a result of the Court order and claims to have been stripped naked, blindfolded, touched with unidentified objects around his genitals and subject to sleep deprivation and simulated execution. Six colleagues who were detained at the same time also claimed to have experienced similar treatment. They were eventually absolved by the Spanish Audiencia Nacional (High Court) in 2010, which also criticized the Judge's decision to close the only newspaper at the time which was fully in the Basque language without more solid constitutional grounds. The Partido Popular government sued Otamendi for defamation but was eventually ordered by the European Court of Human Rights to pay Otamendi compensation for not taking his allegations seriously nor investigating them. Another case is that of Fernando Elejalde Tapia, arrested minutes after murdering Francisco Javier Gomez Al√≥segui at the door of his house; Gomez Al√≥segui was the psychologist of Martutene prison and a public supporter of negotiation with ETA and bringing convicts to jails close to the Basque Country. Amnesty International reported concern about Elejalde Tapia as a suspected case of torture. After being arrested he was transferred to hospital with \\"a fractured ear drum, four broken vertebrae in his back, bruising all over his body, blackened eyes, a kidney malfunction and was in a state of semi-consciousness.\\" Ms Leire Gallastegui claimed in 2001 to have been told to choose between \\"electrodes, her mother's arrest or a broom handle\\". In December 2010 four Civil Guard police officers were imprisoned for torturing two men suspected of terrorist activities. The police officers were released in 2011 after appealing to the Spanish High Court, which judged the injuries sustained by the suspects to have been caused by a violent arrest.Joxe Arregi dead with bruises and burnings all over his body after 9 days detained incommunicado in Madrid On the 13 of February 1981 Joxe Arregi, an alleged member of ETA, died of pneumonia in the hospital of Carabanchel prison after spending 9 days in police custody. The forensic report concluded that he was tortured; he showed second degree burns on the soles of his feet, as well as blows and traumas over his body. Two policemen involved in the interrogation were eventually given sentences of 3 months in prison and a two-year suspension for torturing the detainee. No judgment was made in court as to whether Arregi had died as a result of the torture he received because neither the prosecutor nor the Human Rights Organization party to the case asked the judge to do so. However, a first sentence establishing no connection between torture and death was later overturned on the grounds of the contradictions found on the judge's conclusion. It was reported in the Spanish press that Arregi may have died as a result of being submitted to a torture technique called la ba√±era in which the victim's head is placed in a container of dirty water until he or she is obliged to breathe in the liquid which then enters the victims lungs. Santiago Brouard, doctor and member of the political party HASI at the time, speculated that it may account for Arregi's broncopneumonia. In September 2014, a Basque report commissioned by the human rights society Argituz and based on the Istanbul Protocol confirmed the veracity of the 45 torture testimonies analyzed spanning from 1982 to 2010 for detainees held incommunicado under the Antiterrorist Law. The report carried out by over 30 health professionals, especially psychotherapists and psychiatric doctors, hailing from 8 different organizations have stressed the difficulties found to obtain any records due to the incommunicado regime that \\"facilitates the commission of torture and mistreatment\\", as well as pointing to an ever-increasing use of psychological torture techniques.\\" An expert panel appointed by Mariano Rajoy's cabinet to evaluate the provisions in place for the prevention of torture underscored that \\"mistreatment cases are not exceptional, but symptoms of structural deficiencies\\", recommending as well to install CCTV cameras in all areas of the police stations. Unai Romano's is another case that may have been prevented with the use of CCTV. The Basque youth was arrested and transferred to Madrid in 2001, receiving severe injuries to his head while in custody; as stated by Romano, \\"on arrival in Madrid I was put in a cell, I was instructed not look at their eyes, then interrogations began. When my answer did not suit them, I got beaten on my head.\\" He was taken to hospital, with Romano filing a report, but his claims went unheard, dismissed by the relevant Spanish tribunal. He then took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, where the case was being considered in early 2015. The images of Romano's swollen and deformed head were leaked, and showed on posters protesting against torture across the Basque Country. In February 2018, in the midst of a political controversy, with the Basque Nationalist Party MP Aitor Esteban urging the Spanish government to condemn Civil Guard head Manuel Sanchez Corb√≠ for including his party in the fight against ETA, labelled as 'the evil', disclosed that the law-enforcement official was condemned in 1997 for torture against a Basque, and pardoned subsequently by the Spanish government. =International criticism= Since 2002 Spain has been criticised several times by United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for not investigating properly allegations of torture made by ETA members and others suspected of having links to it. Specifically Spain has been found to have violated articles 2, 4 and 14 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. France was also criticised by CAT for having deported ETA member Josu Arkauz Arana to Spain in 1997 where he was \\"in a situation where he was particularly vulnerable to possible abuse\\". France was found to have violated article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in that case. CAT investigated the case of Kepa Urra in 2002, who claimed to have been tortured by 4 members of the Guardia Civil in 1997 during an operation to dismantle part of ETA. Although the four guardia were initially convicted in a Spanish court of having tortured Urra they were later pardoned. Spain was found guilty of a violation of articles 2, 4 and 14 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Two years later, in 2004 a United Nations report written by Theo van Boven stated that the fact that detainees are held incommunicado for up to 5 days allows abuses to take place, and advised the Spanish government to make changes to this practice. In 2012 CAT ruled against Spain again, this time for not investigating accusations of torture made by Oskarz Gallastegi, who had been sentenced to 26 years in jail for his role in the murder of a judge in the Basque Country in 2001, In 2010 the ECtHR in Strasbourg made its first ruling against Spain for not investigating properly allegations of torture made by ETA member Mikel San Argimiro. In 2014 the ECtHR criticised Spain again for failing to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of the authorities. This time the cases of Ms Beatriz Etxebarria Caballero, and Mr Oihan Unai Ataun Rojo were examined. It was shown that the Spanish authorities did little to investigate their claims of torture and ordered Spain to pay each compensation. In 2015 the ECtHR found Spain guilty of violating the procedural aspects of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the case brought against it by Arratibel Garciandia. Most recently, in May 2016, the ECtHR ruled against Spain for not investigating properly allegations of torture made by Xabier Beorlegi. Amnesty International has also condemned Spain for holding prisoners incommunicado. A report published in 1999 stated that it \\"believes it to be beyond question that incommunicado detention facilitates torture and ill-treatment.\\" Again in 2002 Amnesty International released a report criticising the Spanish government for its policy of holding detainees incommunicado. The report states that it had \\"received some very serious and highly detailed reports, which appear to be corroborated by medical evidence. Many of the allegations referred to the practice of asphyxiation with plastic bags; repeated kicks and blows of the hand on the head or testicles; forced physical exercises for long periods of time; claims of sexual harassment or abuse; threats of execution, rape, miscarriage or injury to partners and relatives.\\" In June 2014 Amnesty International reported on the 'impunity and denial' of the Spanish authorities regarding torture. The human rights organization stated that it had continued to receive allegations of torture and mistreatment inflicted by state security forces since 1987, the year when Spain ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture. The international organization goes on to say that \\"the Spanish authorities do not take seriously the gravity of torture as a crime of international law, and meanwhile, the victims of torture remain defenseless.\\" In the same report Amnesty International says that successive Spanish governments \\"have not established sufficient measures and mechanisms necessary to prevent torture taking place while in the custody of its security forces, e.g. the suspension of the incommunicado regime, which remains in place, or the introduction of CCTV in all the places where detainees are held, nor have they implemented provisions leading to thorough, independent and impartial investigation of torture when it takes place.\\" In January 2018, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Spain for degrading and inhuman treatment inflicted by the Civil Guard to Mattin Sarasola and Igor Portu, two ETA members convicted of the T-4 bombings in Madrid. For the first time the tribunal ruled on content, and not just on form, i.e. Spain not investigating torture, for which Spain has been condemned 9 more times by the same court during the last years. The court thus supports a previous ruling by a Basque court which condemned 4 Civil Guard officers for torture, a sentence that was overturned by the Spanish High Court. It constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights. In May 2019, fifteen independent experts making up the UNO Committee against Torture resolved that Gorka Lupia√±ez, condemned for ETA membership and other related offences by Spanish tribunals, was subjected to torture by the Civil Guard in 2007 during incommunicado detention, using methods such as bag suffocation, battering, sleep deprivation, and death threats, as denounced by the victim; following Lupia√±ez's denouncement, the Spanish authorities accused him of \\"following ETA's agenda\\". The Committee once more urges Spanish authorities to stop incommunicado detentions for their relation to torture, reminds them that nothing justifies it, as well as demanding that they \\"pursue diligent, immediate and impartial investigations\\". =Claims of false torture allegations= Successive Spanish Governments have consistently stated that, in general terms, torture claims by Basque detainees are part of a tactic by ETA to gain political capital and sympathy as well as to bog down the legal process, rather than a systematic practice of torture by Spanish authorities. As stated by El Pa√≠s, there is no evidence to show that the Spanish security forces have systematically used torture against ETA suspects. According to Secretary General of the Unified Police Syndicate Jos√© Manuel S√°nchez-Fornet, there exist 'absolutely exceptional cases of mistreatment' with a small number of trials and convictions of members of the Police and Guardia Civil, but he also avows that anti-terrorist legislation 'helps cases of torture' happen. Just the opposite, the Coordinating Committee for the Prevention of Torture has underscored the obstacles set by the successive Spanish governments to carry out proper investigation, failing to meet the most basic requirements expected for investigations on torture allegations, with only two severe cases leading to an effective conviction of police officials, both condemnations warranted by judges in the Basque Country, and not Madrid tribunals. In 2008 a manual produced by ETA for its members was found by the Guardia Civil in the hands of ETA members Igor Portu and Mattin Sarasola, when they were arrested in the house of a third ETA member Mikel Sebastian. This manual, written entirely in the Basque language and eventually leaked to the press, was named Atxiloketari Aurre Eginez, 2¬∫ zkia (Facing Detention, Volume 2). It detailed what ETA members should do once detained by the police. According to the press, the three main directives of this document were firstly, \\"do not make a statement\\", secondly, \\"deny everything\\", and thirdly, \\"report torture\\". Starting with a first hand account of a detention process, the manual highlights the comfort of court jail cells, and says a forensic doctor will visit detainees before they appear before a judge. ETA members are told that once in a court jail they need not worry about threats and blackmails made during their interrogation in the police station because they cannot be returned there. As reported by El Pa√≠s, once in the court jail, the documents directs members to tell the forensic doctor that they have been tortured mentally as well as physically, and to tell that the statements they made in the police station were extracted under torture. Official court papers make no mention of these details. A similar manual was confiscated from the ETA cell \\"Commando Araba\\" in 1998, recommending all ETA detainees to allege torture, reminding them that \\"standing behind you are the press, local, youth and international collectives and, with a bit of luck, some opportunist and doubtful political party.\\" However, the NGO (TAT) has pointed out that this document is totally different in style, tone and language to other 'manuals' found in the possession of the \\"Commando Araba\\". TAT has stated that they suspect the document was created by the police. Solidarity Demonstration in support of the Basque prisoners' rights, Bilbao 2015 the accused of Altsasu in San Fermines, Pamplona 2017 The Basque Country has seen many actions and events in solidarity of the Basque prisoners with political motivation. Solidarity has materialized in gatherings, demonstrations, and other events. During the inauguration of the 1999 IAAF World Championships held in Seville two activists disguised as mascots of the games, the Giraldillas, made it onto the stage and remained there during the presentation wearing the logo and slogans for Basque prisoners' repatriation, with another activist showing a placard. Following the permanent truce by ETA in 2011, the echo of events against the Spanish dispersal policy and in support of the prisoners' rights have gained momentum and a more central position in the Basque political agenda. Sare is a major movement advocating for the rights of Basque prisoners. It calls a mass demonstration each early January in Bilbao with a turnout of tens of thousands. On 9 January 2016, tens of thousands also march in Bilbao, while between 7,500 and 10,000 took to the streets in Bayonne with the same demand. They included a wide range of social and political agents from the Basque society. On 15 January 2017, 80,000 demonstrators according to organizers rallied through the streets of Bilbao to demand an end to the dispersal policies implemented on 350 Basque prisoners scattered all over Spain and France, and the release of seriously ill prisoners. Sare denounced that prisoners are being irregularly retained in captivity beyond the conviction term. On 9 December 2017, thousands arriving from the Basque Country marched through central Paris with demands for an end to the dispersal policy and the special, emergency regime implemented on Basque prisoners. It was supported by the near totality of the French Basque representatives, including Jean-Ren√© Etchegaray, mayor of Bayonne and the Basque agglomeration. On 13 January 2018, this demonstration took place again under bleak weather conditions with the same demands. On her address in the Spanish Congress during the votation for the inauguration of the Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez on 3 January 2020, the MP of EH Bildu Mertxe Aizpurua donned a pin for the transfer of the Basque prisoners back to their homeland, demanding also an end to \\"the revenge and emergency prison policy against the Basque prisoners\\" amidst an atmosphere of high tension in which she was subject to verbal abuse. The following day, the society Dignidad y Justicia filed a report before the Supreme Court against her for \\"humiliation of the victims of terrorism\\" on the grounds that supporting the rapprochement of these prisoners to the Basque Country is \\"a long-running demand of the ETA terrorists\\", also stating that ETA's disbanding is 'fake'. A week later, 65,000 thousands turned out to the streets of Bilbao to demand an end to the dispersal policies; a further 10,00 took to the streets of Bayonne the same day. Escapes There have been a number of attempts at escaping from custody. Of the 10 successful escapes, 2 have been from hospitals, undertaken during Franco's dictatorial regime and early Transition. The biggest, the Segovia prison break, involved 29 prisoners who dug a tunnel to escape Segovia prison in 1976. A film has been made based on it. The most recent escape was by Ibon Fern√°ndez Iradi who managed to flee the police station where he was being held in France in 2002. Reintegration into society When prisoners are released they are currently offered help by Harrera Elkartea, an organisation created in 2012, which helps them looking for work, sorting out their finances, paperwork and other issues. Some politicians have called for this organisation to be made illegal. In its first 2 years Harrera Elkartea has helped 18 ex-prisoners back into work, 45 to get their driving license, and about 40 to get dental treatment and sort out eye problems. Publications In 2002 the Atarami√±e cultural association was set up to promote and publish literary work of these prisoners. Each year since then a book has been published compiling shorter works, and many other longer works have also been published. Recent developments In December 2013 the EPPK, which is the collective organisation negotiating on behalf of the prisoners, dropped its long standing demand for amnesty for all the prisoners, leaving the way open for individuals to negotiate individually for their release. Also in December 2013, ETA declared that they recognised the \\"suffering and damage\\" caused by their actions, and also acknowledged the Spanish legal system. These two declarations were key demands from Madrid before any talks could start over the conditions of the prisoners. In May 2014 the Minister of the Interior, Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az said that the government would not consider the ending of the policy of dispersion unless ETA disbanded completely, or until the individual prisoners ask for forgiveness. In July 2014 France agreed for the first time to transfer 2 prisoners to a prison near the Basque Country. The Spanish government agreed in October 2014 to let members of ETA with Spanish nationality who are imprisoned in France, be transferred to prisons in Spain. In August 2017, the minister of interior Juan Ignacio Zoido declared he would not undertake any measures in order to change the prison policy until ETA disbands. In April 2018, ETA announced its dissolution, a move staged in an international conference held in Cambo (Kanbo), French Basque Country. All the same, UPN, a strategic ally of PP in Navarre, overtly refused to support Rajoy's national budget for 2018 with its two MPs if the prime minister allowed a transfer of Basque prisoners to internment centres closer to the Basque Country, a political stance echoing the staunch opposition showed by Ciudadanos to \\"a negotiation by Rajoy's cabinet of privileges with Basque nationalists\\", including measures to bring ETA prisoners closer home. On 11 January 2020, the judge of the National Court of Spain Jos√© Luis Calama ordered the police a close scrutiny of the demonstration against the dispersal policy taking place in Bilbao to watch out for possible \\"humiliation of the victims\\" or \\"praise or justification of terrorism\\". On the same grounds, the party VOX demanded a ban to the demonstration, while the party PP labelled the demonstration as 'derisory' to the victims of ETA, and the support of Podemos to the rally as 'appaling', demanding the incoming president of Spain Pedro Sanchez to take sides; on the rally, an ETA victim and a GAL victim urged that they not be used for political purposes. On 8 January, the association of relatives of Basque prisoners Etxerat denounced on a press release that 19 incurable prisoners and undergoing severe disease were being held imprisoned, demanding the release of those with death prognosis and risk. The association raised the figure of Basque prisoners of political motivation to approximately 250.

It is served in most regions in Uganda and is defined as mingled. The main ingredients of the dish are sweet potatoes and beans.  Origins  Mugoyo is popular in some communities in Uganda. The Iteso call it ‚Äúemugoyo‚Äù, the Baganda refer to it as Mugoyo or Omugoyo which means it is mingled. In Buganda, omugoyo has been associated with aging women because it is assumed only old women have the patience to prepare it due to the straining process. The common myth about omugoyo in Buganda is that two lovers are not supposed to serve each other omugoyo. It is believed that such an act would extinguish the fire and may even result in a failed relationship.  Recipes The recipe for mugoyo consists of red kidney beans also known as Nambale and sweet potatoes.  Cooking Method  The cooking process is started by boiling dried red kidney beans known as Nambale with salt till tender. The dark purple sweet potatoes are then peeled and steamed in banana leaves till tender. The beans and sweet potatoes are mashed together to form one dish. Mugoyo is prepared over firewood where the smoke from the firewood adds a great taste to the mugoyo during the baking moment known as kubobeeza. Mugoyo can also be served with coffee or tea for breakfast. One would have cover it in plantains and momentarily roast it on the traditional Kiganda stove known as ekyoto.

Many of his paintings have the hard edges, smooth surfaces, and simplified forms of the precisionists and their typical subjects‚Äîcityscapes and industrial scenes‚Äîare sometimes also his, but in general his works have an emotional element and, as one critic as said, \\"take on an otherworldly tone\\" that sets them apart. In addition to work showing a personal version of precisionism, he produced paintings, drawings, and prints in the social realist, Mexican muralist, and surrealist styles as well as still lifes, portraits, and landscapes that defy easy classification. His work achieved critical recognition from 1919 onward, has been widely collected, and is today found in many American museums including the Phillips Collection, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Corcoran Gallery. Early life and education House by Stefan Hirsch, 1920, Graphite on paper, 7‚Öù x 9‚Öû inches New York, Lower Manhattan by Stefan Hirsch, 1920 or 1921, oil on canvas, 74 x 86 inches Roses in a Vase by Stefan Hirsch, 1919, graphite on paper, 12¬º x 10 inches Pastoral Scene, New England by Stefan Hirsch, oil on canvas, 1926, 19 x 32 inches Hirsch was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to parents who were American citizens of German heritage. He studied law and art at the University of Z√ºrich and was there exposed to artists associated with the Dada movement. When he was 20 his family emigrated to New York and there he was befriended by the teacher and art patron, Hamilton Easter Field. Along with the painter, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and sculptor, Robert Laurent, he spent several summer sessions at Field's school in Ogunquit, Maine. His first appearance in an exhibition was in 1919 at the Society of Independent Artists in New York. Mature style: 1920s At the time of his first one-man show in 1927 a critic for the New York Sun was surprised Hirsch had not been given one before. His work stood out when it was exhibited and was collected widely, this critic wrote. He said it was modern but not revolutionary and its quality was undisputed. Hirsch's subjects at this time were mainly buildings: structures without human presence. Critics described his paintings as cool, reserved, and somewhat aloof. The critic for the Sun said they showed \\"a moment when everything stops.\\" Their design was flat. The colors were muted and harmonious with a \\"purity and clarity of color like things painted on porcelain or silk.\\" They possessed an \\"intellectual austerity\\" but were nonetheless said to convey the essential character of a scene. Hirsch's drawing, House, of 1920 shows some influences of C√©zanne and the cubists in its juxtaposed panels and emphasis on the two-dimensional surface of the paper. Its spare, geometric design was typical of his style during this decade. His painting, Lower Manhattan, of either 1920 or 1921, is one of his best known pieces. It possesses the \\"essential flatness\\" of most of his output and shows his artistic skill in its overall design, coloration and balanced tonal relations. Hirsch's paintings and drawings in the 1920s were not all in the manner of his urban landscapes. His 1919 drawing of flowers on a table with note cards and knife is realistic with a tonal balance and clarity that would later be recognized as distinguishing his best work. In 1924 he showed a \\"monumental nude\\" at the Bourgeois Gallery in New York and, that same year, he made a lithograph showing the heads of three women in hats and coats. A rural landscape, Pastoral Scene, New England, painted in 1926, contrasts sharply with his cityscapes in its rounded contours and blue- and red-toned pallette. In 1927 he showed a circus scene at that year's Salons of America exhibition which a critic found to be witty and more flexible than his \\"mathematically exact\\" paintings. In his solo exhibit at the Bourgeois Galleries that same year he showed three portraits (Mrs. Catherine Grossman, Dr. Michael Ringer, and A Young Girl). In 1928 he showed a painting called Lilies of the Valley in an exhibition at the Downtown Galleries and the following year he produced a whimsical drawing called \\"Stuart Davis Mailbox\\" which shows the back of a woman holding a small American flag beside a mechanical letterbox contraption with human features, in profile. At about the same time he painted a rural landscape, Horse Pasture, described as showing clean outline and peaceful horizons. Life events: 1920s In 1922 Hirsch was a founding director and recording secretary of the Salons of America. Hamilton Easter Field created the Salons as an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists which he felt unfairly was giving preferential treatment to some of its members. Hirsch would remain as a director and would continue to show at the Salons exhibitions until 1936. In 1927 Hirsch was given his first solo exhibition. This event took place at the Bourgeois Gallery, New York. Two years later, with Robert Laurent, Wood Gaylor, and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Hirsch established the Field Foundation. Using a legacy from Hamilton Easter Field, the foundation was run by artists to help other artists by purchasing their work. Mature style: 1930s Kachinas by Stefan Hirsch, 1929, oil on Canvas, 20 x 26 inches Construction of Roosevelt Highway by Stefan Hirsch, ca. 1930, oil on canvas, 30 x 40 inches The paintings, drawings, and lithographs that Hirsch made in the 1930s were mainly in the social realist style of the time. Like other artists, he made murals as well as doing easel work. In these pieces there is little evidence of the precisionist influence that had marked much of his work in the 1920s. His colors were bolder and the paintings showed more depth. Some of the most colorful paintings came from visits he made to Mexico from 1929 to 1933. A small one, Kachinas shows the same careful handling of tones and balancing of pictorial elements as in his earlier work, but its colors are intense and its treatment realistic. The figures shown are Hopi spirit-figures, one of whom is performing a ritual snake dance.Image credit: Mark Sublette Medicine Man Gallery Tucson AZ Other subjects from these trips include burros, a bullfight scene, musicians, and an allegorical painting of a priest, soldiers, a man with a bag of money, and three peasants slumbering.An image of this painting can be seen at The Cobbs, Auctioneers: http://www.thecobbs.com/auction-2013-03-16-lot-99.html Hirsch's social realist style can be seen in Construction of Roosevelt Highway of about 1930 shows five dark-skinned laborers, none facing the viewer, all having postures showing resignation or despondence. Industrial buildings spewing smoke and a set of grain elevators appear in the background. Mural, Justice As Protector and Avenger by Stefan Hirsch, Charles E. Simmons, Jr. Federal Court House, Aiken, South Carolina Early in the 1930s, Hirsch experimented with surrealism. In 1932 he showed two paintings, Pent House and Encounter, which a critic said were effective without revealing the depths of the human psyche. A first mural, Dispatcher, was shown at the Grand Central Galleries in 1935 by arrangement with the Mural Painters Society of which he was a member. Between 1934 and 1937 he contributed his time and materials to paint a number of murals in the auditorium of Lenox Hill House, New York. The social realist panels depict \\"Recreation,\\" The Desire to Build,\\" \\"The Desire to Learn,\\" \\"Cultural Pursuits,\\" and other subjects. In 1938 he took a commission from the Federal Art Project to paint a mural in the Federal Courthouse in Aiken, South Carolina. Called Justice as Protector, the mural had a central figure whose dark skin offended the court's judges and the mural was consequently covered by a drape for many years. Five years later he was given a commission by the U.S. Treasury Department for a post office mural in Booneville, Mississippi. This one, called Scenic and Historic Booneville showed no dark skinned people and occasioned no local controversy, but there was disagreement between Hirsch and the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts. He wished to paint a Civil War skirmish that took place near Booneville and when that was refused, he painted a war-related scene of home-front family members and overseas servicemen writing and reading letters.Despite the change in subject, the mural, somewhat confusingly, retains its original title. Woman Portrait by Stefan Hirsch, 1940, watercolor, 9 x 7 inches Hirsch's solo exhibition at the Associated American Galleries in 1941 summarized his easel work of the previous decade. It included cityscapes (Fiftieth Street and Queensboro Bridge) and social-realist figures (Matador, Muleteer, and Quitting Time) from Mexico and New York, as well as a landscape (New England February), and domestic scenes (Wash Day andDomestic Still Life). Edward Alden Jewell of the New York Times said these works varied from one another in style with the more recent canvases showing \\"a simply integrated design\\" and \\"agreeable color harmonies.\\" Life events: 1930s During his travels in Mexico from 1929 to 1933, Hirsch became friends with David Siqueiros and Diego Rivera and in January 1932 wrote a letter to the New York Times praising the Mexican government's support for its artists. From 1919 when he and his parents returned from Germany until 1931 when he married the teacher and artist, Elsa Rogo, Hirsch had lived in his parents' house in Columbia Heights, Brooklyn. While continuing to produce paintings and other art, Hirsch began a second career in art instruction. His first teaching job, at Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont, began in 1934 and continued until 1940. Later life and work Stefan Hirsch shown working on several drafts of his painting, The Bombing of Nuremberg, 1947. The completed canvas now hangs in the president's office, Bard College. From 1940 to 1946, Hirsch taught at the Art Students League of New York. From 1942 until his retirement in 1961 he taught at Bard College and was for most of that time chairman of the art department. In 1941 Hirsch participated in a controversy about experimentation in art in the New York Times. Edward Alden Jewell of the Times had received a letter from a man named Samuel M. Kootz issuing a blanket condemnation of the previous decade's output by American painters and calling for experiments to break free from a complacent sameness of output. Hirsch responded to the effect that quality in art wasn't so much dependent on simply being new as it was on fresh interpretation of timeless themes and techniques. Family Hirsch's father, Angelo Hirsch, was born on April 11, 1863, in Roth, Bavaria, Germany. He emigrated to New York in 1886 and died there aged 74 on August 1, 1937. He was the son of Gerson Hirsch, Jr. Hirsch's mother was Florence Thurnauer (May 17, 1874 to July 21, 1929) who was the daughter of William Thurnauer and Mina Thurnauer. Both parents were American citizens at the time of Hirsch's birth. Hirsch had a sister, Dorothy, who was ten years younger than he.The 1940 Census of the United States shows Dorothy T. Hirsch as a nurse in a tuberculosis sanitarium in Deerfield Town, Oneida, New York. Hirsch lived with his parents (and after his mother's death with his father) until his marriage on January 25, 1931, to Elsa Rogo The couple had no children. In 1932, Rogo was head of an art school for Mexican children in Taxaco. They lived in Bennington, Vermont, when Hirsch taught at the college there and lived in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, when he taught at Bard.

It involves a certain heterogeneous and divisible resource, such as a birthday cake, and n partners with different preferences over different parts of the cake. It allows the n people to achieve a proportional division.  History  The first published algorithm for proportional division of a cake was the last diminisher algorithm, published in 1948. Its run-time complexity was O(n^2). in 1984, Shimon Even and Azaria Paz published their improved algorithm, whose run-time complexity is only O(n log n).  Description  The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, it is possible to achieve a proportional division in time O(n log n). * Each partner is asked to draw a line dividing the cake into a right and left part such that he believes the ratio is ‚åän/2‚åã:‚åàn/2‚åâ. The cuts are required to be non- intersecting; a simple way to guarantee this is to allow only horizontal lines or only vertical lines. * The algorithm sorts the n lines in increasing order and cuts the cake in the median of the lines, i.e. at the ‚åän/2‚åãth line. E.g., if there are 5 partners that draw lines at x=1, x=3, x=5, x=8 and x=9, then the algorithm cuts the cake vertically at x=3. * The algorithm assigns to each of the two parts the partners whose line is inside that part, i.e. the partners that drew the first ‚åän/2‚åã lines get assigned to the left part, the others to the right part. E.g., the partners that drew lines at x=1 and x=3 are assigned to the left part and the other three partners are assigned to the right part. Each part is divided recursively among the partners assigned to it. It is possible to prove by induction that every partner playing by the rules is guaranteed a piece with a value of at least 1/n, regardless of what the other partners do. Thanks to the divide-and-conquer strategy, the number of iterations is only O(log n), in contrast to O(n) in the Last Diminisher procedure. In each iteration, each partner is required to make a single mark. Hence, the total number of marks required is O(n log n).  Optimality  Several years after the publication of the Even‚ÄìPaz algorithm, it was proved that every deterministic or randomized proportional division procedure assigning each person a contiguous piece must use Œ©(n log n) actions. Moreover, every deterministic proportional division procedure must use Œ©(n log n) actions, even if the procedure is allowed to assign to each partner a non- contiguous piece, and even if the procedure is allowed to only guarantee approximate fairness., These hardness results imply that the Even‚ÄìPaz algorithm is the fastest possible algorithm for achieving full proportionality with contiguous pieces, and it is the fastest possible deterministic algorithm for achieving even partial proportionality and even with disconnected pieces. The only case in which it can be improved is with randomized algorithms guaranteeing partial proportionality with disconnected pieces; see Edmonds‚ÄìPruhs algorithm.  Randomized version  It is possible to use randomization in order to reduce the number of marks. The following randomized version of the recursive halving procedure achieves a proportional division using only O(n) mark queries on average. The idea is that, in each iteration, instead of asking all partners to make a half-value mark, only some partners are asked to make such marks, while the other partners only choose which half they prefer. The partners are sent either to the west or to the east according to their preferences, until the number of partners in each side is n/2. Then a cut is made, and each group of n/2 partners divides its half recursively.This randomized recursive halving algorithm is similar to a well-known randomized algorithm for Ranking - finding the r-ranked element in an array of numbers In the worst case we still need n-1 marks per iteration so the worst-case number of marks required is O(n log n). However, on average only O(log n) marks are required per iteration; by solving a recurrence formula it is possible to show that the average number of marks required is O(n). Note that the total number of queries is still O(n log n), since each partner has to select a half.

Balan (17 October 1942 ‚Äì 22 January 2002), popularly known as Artist V. Balan, was a sculptor and painter from India. He was born the son of Chellamma and Venketachelam Pillai in the small temple town of Perumbavoor, Kerala. In 1962 he earned a Diploma from the Cochin School of Art. Immediately after his studies, he started teaching at the same school. In 1970 he moved to Chennai as a freelance artist. At Chennai, he did his first ever Mosaic Art of the Risen Lord for a chapel of Salesian Provincialate. From 1972 onwards, he started designing the interiors of churches throughout India and acquired fame as an artist and architect of Christian places of worship. Ten years later he moved to Bangalore and established his studio, Arte Sacra, near the National Biblical, Catechetical and Liturgical Centre. Introduction to Christian art For 15 years until 1982 Balan lived in Madras. His talents were versatile, varying from canvas to mosaic, from metal to wood and from sculpture to architecture. He executed Christian works in different parts of the country from the North ‚Äì Rishikesh in the Himalayas ‚Äì to the south and even to Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, he renovated the interior of St. Mary's Church at Negombo. He was the chief designer of the interior and the fa√ßade of the Stella Maris Cathedral in Port Blair, Andaman Islands. He later did more than 300 works related to churches and religious institutions during his tenure in Madras. The artist on the move In 1983 Balan moved from Madras to Kothanur, a peaceful village in the suburbs of Bangalore, where he built his studio, Tapovan. Many disciples attended the training centre, which was set up along with the studio for young artists in simple Gurukula style ‚Äì Kalakshetra. Multifaceted talent Balan was very passionate in painting right through his career. Though Balan is often identified with his characteristic mosaic art, his sculptures reveal his profound artistic talent more than any other medium. \\"The queen of the apostles\\" is a unique presentation of the theme at the Shrine of St. Vincent Pallotti, Bangalore. The visualization of \\"The song of creation\\" of Francis of Assisi is a relief sculpture with copper finish. The gigantic relief sculpture measuring 125√ó42 in the Sanctuary of the St. Vincent Pallotti's Shrine, Banasawadi, Bangalore depicts salvation history from creation to the resurrection as a background to the 45' high resurrection figure and the Christian Community gathered in worship. The sculptor in Balan is clearly seen in the peculiar forms and shapes of altars and tabernacles he has given shape in wood, stone and metal in different churches. Balan also works in the medium of metal. The peculiar metallic figures and images cast in his studio are a manifestation of his multifaceted talent. Traditional stained glass was another favorite medium of Balan. The architectural talent in Balan was a natural extension of the artist in him. His clear and detailed drawings for churches are proof of that architectural mettle and precision. He designed and executed many churches in India and abroad. The silent man Balan kept away from the limelight and media. He never put a signature on his paintings, mosaics or murals. He was little known as a person and loved his anonymity. He never satisfied with any of his works and always thought it could have been done better.

The first store opened in Calgary at Southcentre Mall. Expansion and growth Competing against predominantly burgers, subs, pizza and fried chicken establishments, the teppanyaki-style concept grew in popularity with its customers as it offered an alternative to North American cuisine.

John Wentworth House, is a historic house at 346 Pleasant Street in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Built in 1763, it is notable for its fine Georgian finishes, and for its associations with leading political and economic figures of 18th and 19th-century Portsmouth. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It has since the early 20th century been part of a senior care complex. Description and history The Mark Wentworth House stands southeast of downtown Portsmouth, on the south side of Pleasant Street at Wentworth Street. The house is oriented facing north to the street, and is extended southward to the South Mill Pond by a large modern addition that houses the bulk of the senior care facilities. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The building corners have wooden quoins, and the cornice is lined with modillion blocks. The main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrical arrangement. The entrance at the center is topped by a half-round transom window, and is sheltered by a Federal-period portico with a modillioned cornice and hip roof surrounded by a low balustrade. The interior of the house continues the high quality wooden finishes. The mansion was built in 1763 by Henry Appleton, a merchant, who sold it to Mark Hunking Wentworth, one of New Hampshire's wealthiest merchants and landowners, the following year. Wentworth's son John was appointed Royal Governor of New Hampshire in 1767, and occupied the house from then until his departure on the eve of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. Mark Wentworth maintained ownership of the house during the first part of this period, and transferred the property to his daughter Anna Fisher in 1770. It was sold out of the Wentworth family in 1797, and repurchased by Ebenezer Wentworth in 1810. In the early 1900s Wentworth descendants adapted the property for use as an elder care facility, a role it continues to serve today.

Bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. Coiled tubing drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional jointed pipe drilling rigs., Niobrara Wells Prove BHA for Coiled Tubing, Drilling Contractor, 15 Mar 2012, Retrieved 30 July 2014 Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits. , Introduction to Coiled Tubing: Drilling Applications, ICoTA, Retrieved 29 July 2014 Advantages of Coiled Tubing Drilling =Underbalanced Conditions= Underbalanced drilling is the main advantage of Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) that jointed pipe drilling cannot easily replicate. CTD allows for continuous drilling and pumping and can increase the rate of penetration (ROP). =Speed of Operation= The second advantage of CTD is its ability to drill at high ROPs with increased time with the bit on bottom. This is made possible as operations do not need to stop to make and break connections. This can provide significant cost savings and both drilling time and rig-up time are far quicker with CTD, decreasing costs and increasing the rate of return. =Safety= CTD operations compare favourably to jointed pipe drilling as fewer rig hands are required on the rig floor. =Lower Environmental Impact= An additional advantage is the environmental impact of CTD. The well footprint, human interaction, discharges and noise pollution are greatly reduced by using CTD. Multiple wells can also be drilled from the same pad utilising a directional BHA and therefore CTD offers a more sustainable and lower impact method of drilling. Operations CTD has been used across the world in regions such as Alaska (US), Canada and the in the Middle eastern countries which includes Shariah (United Arab Emirates), Oman and in Saudi Arabia., Coiled Tubing Drilling, PetroWiki, Retrieved 30 July 2014 Typical applications include depleted wells, unconventional gas shale, underground coal gasification and coal bed methane.

Over a dozen scripts have been reported for Hmong, none of which is considered standard for transcribing the languages in the eyes of the speakers.  Historically referenced scripts  It is unknown whether a historic writing system existed for the Hmong. Several Hmong scripts have been noted in historical works, mostly in Chinese literature, as illustrated in the below sections. However, this evidence is disputed. For instance, according to Professor S. Robert Ramsey, there was no writing system among the Miao until the missionaries created them. Archaeologists are still searching for artifacts from periods of alleged Hmong literacy. These five scripts below are the most widely evidenced in primary literature sources: = Nanman script = From Chinese legends, the Nanman are largely considered to be the ancestors of the Hmong, also known as one of the \\"Four Barbarians\\" against the Huaxia, the ancestors of the Han. The Nanman lived originally in central-east China, but after battle losses and the expulsion of Chi You, who is allegedly considered a Godlike figure by the Hmong, the Nanman fled to the south. Different stories exist as to how their script and already encoded information disappeared: that the books were lost in a flood, that the Hmong had to eat the books as food due to the Chinese invasion, that they were eaten by other animals in their escapade from the Chinese, or that they had no way to cross the river without disposing of the books. All the stories have in common a loss of the books, water, and an invading Chinese tribe. This script has not been found. = Paj Ntaub (Flower Cloth) = In response to the Chinese invasion, the Hmong claim that they preserved their ancient writing system in the \\"flower cloth\\" of the women. This seems to be a common story in response to the deluge and loss of books in the aftermath of the alleged loss of the Nanman to the Huaxia. A modern script on the Internet known as the \\"Ancient Hmong Written System\\" claims to be a decipherment of this script, but no connection has been asserted from a neutral, reliable source. = Qing Dynasty script = It is unknown whether this script differs from that of the Nanman, but it is known that as far as the Qing dynasty, the Hmong used a writing system to record information. It is unclear for how long they used this script, as Han settlers largely moved into the southern regions of China (where the Hmong lived), only during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In attempts to coerce the Hmong, also known as the Miao, Hmong villages were burned and relics of Hmong culture were destroyed. Hmongs were also banned from transcribing their language, so it is not known whether any Hmong writing from the era remains or where it remains. = Shaoyang Relics script = The \\"Book from Heaven\\" seems to be engraved in a Miao script, as reported in March 2012 from Shaoyang, Hunan. The Hunan Cultural Relic Department is reportedly investigating the script and any connections it may have. This may represent either the Qing script or the Nanman script, if dated, but any connections and authenticity are unclear. = Monumental Script = A group of monuments across Southern China written in Chinese-looking characters are reported to be those of an \\"Old Miao script\\". A particular monument in Leigongshan, Guizhou has been found with a residual monument inscribing \\"This year is also a good year,\\" and this is preserved in the Guizhou Provincial Museum. These characters are referred to in the Qing dynasty book, Ê¥ûÊ∫™Á∫§Âøó.  Widely used scripts  = Pollard script = The Pollard script was published in 1922 by Sam Pollard for writing A-Hmao, a Hmongic language in Sichuan, China.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 149-150. Published sources seem to indicate that the use of the script was widespread amongst Hmong in Sichuan; however, its use is waning, although it is held in esteem by Hmong of the Christian community and by elders. The current extent of its use is unknown. = Pahawh Hmong = Pahawh Hmong is one of the most successful indigenous scripts to have ever been created by illiterates. It was created by Shong Lue Yang, who was born in 1930 to a farmer. He was seen by the Hmong people as a \\"Chao Fa,\\" or \\"Lord of the Sky,\\"Duffy. (2012). p. 55 which makes him akin to the son of God in Hmong culture. He has a long history that began with the receipt of a divine mandate from the deity \\"Va\\", of whom he proclaimed he was the son. He apparently was visited in an isolated round house by two men from God, who taught him the script over the course of 60 days.Duffy. (2012). p. 54 When he came out and taught people the script, it gained a widespread following. However, two political problems emerged. First, both the French government and the Lao government began to view him with enmity as a result of his influence. Second, due to the military success of Pa Chai's followers, these governments began to associate him with a military agenda, even though none is known to have existed. Thus, he was assassinated in 1971. His script survived through his followers, however, and he even created a script called Pahawh Khmu for the Khmu language. = Ntawv Thoob Teb (RPA) = This script, known as the Romanized Popular Alphabet, was developed from 1951 to 1953 under the auspices of Yves Bertrais, G. Lindwood Barney, and William A. Smalley, and who were Christian missionaries working in the area.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 153. Due to the widespread existence of the Roman script, in the United States, this script remains the most widely adopted among Hmong diaspora. It is also widely used on the Internet. However, controversy surrounding the script includes its representation of consonants in clusters, where many Hmong argue that the consonants are distinct and should not be represented in clusters of two or three. It is gaining popularity in China, but it is relatively disdained by speakers of Hmong Leng.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 129. It is seen as a more \\"pragmatic\\" solution to Hmong writing but a less \\"faithful\\" solution, as Hmongs hold Shong Lue Yang, and less indicative of a Hmong \\"identity.\\"Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 132. = Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong = Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was used in the 1980s by United Christians Liberty Evangelical Church, a church founded by Reverend Chervang Kong Vang, which moved around California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Colorado, and many other states. Initially, it was not as widely accepted outside of the members of the church. The script seems to bear strong resemblance to the Lao alphabet in structure and form and characters inspired from the Hebrew alphabets, although the characters themselves are different. The Unicode proposal for this script uses the name 'Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script'. This script has been used by members of the United Christians Liberty Evangelical church in America for more than 25 years, in printed material and videos. It is reported to have some use in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, France, and Australia. On March 5, 2019, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong Script was officially published into the Unicode Standard version 12.0 with a total of 71 characters in the Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong Unicode block.  Historically used scripts  = Sayaboury script = This is an alphabet that was used, at the very least, by Hmong residents of Sainyabuli Province (the script's namesake) in Laos, who came to a UN Refugee Camp in Chiang Kham, Thailand, as a result of the Vietnam War. It is called by anthropologists as \\"Ntawv Puaj Txwm.\\", which means \\"original writing.\\" Nine volumes of texts reported to be 700‚Äì800 years old were handed over by Ga Va Her to Nina Wimuttikosol, an officer that Her had befriended while in the camp. Allegedly, these writings had been revealed by the Hmong deity La Bi Mi Nu, and the information in these manuscripts was then transcribed.Duffy. (2012). p. 56 Wimuttikosol gave it to Jacques Lemoine, a known French anthropologist in the field. It has a set of unusual features, which if discovered to be original, could dramatically alter the field of Hmong research. It is not known how much further research is currently being undertaken.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 158. The preliminary Unicode proposal for this script uses the name 'Eebee Hmong script'. It is used to write the Hmong Daw (White Hmong) dialect that is commonly spoken in Laos and in the United States.Smalley, W. A., et. al. \\"Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script,\\" p. 157. = Pa Chai script = Pa Chai was a leader of the Hmong in the early twentieth century. He was seen as the \\"Chao Fa\\" of the Hmong people before Shong Lue Yang, although his power was not as far-reaching. He was a leader in the movement against the French colonial empire, and one day, he was taken to the \\"Lord of the Sky and the Earth,\\" known in Hmong as Lub Ntuj Lub Teb.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 18. He received a mandate to lead the Hmong people to change their way of life and develop a new writing system, and it is said that after he returned, he displayed magical powers. These manifested in the form of two years of successful resistance against the French. Apparently, although Pa Chai had instructed his people not to attack the Lao, they did, and this caused him to lose his supposed mandate, which caused the Hmong to begin losing, and in due course, in 1921, he was killed, ending the \\"War of the Insane\\", as it was known to the French. As Shong Lue was the next \\"Chao Fa,\\" this alleged militant intention constantly hung over Shong Lue's head, which contributed to the acceleration of Shong Lue's defamation, mystery, and assassination. Pa Chai's script has reasonable success, with villagers reporting that they had seen Pa Chai's script, encoded laws, and writing methods during the French colonial rule.Duffy. (2012). p. 53 It is unknown what has survived. = Ntawv Savina (Hmong Vietnamese) = This was a French version of the Hmong alphabet developed by Father Savina during French colonization of Indochina. Rather than resembling Ntour Hmongz (Hmong Vietnamese) or Ntawv Hmoob (RPA), it uses tone symbols, like Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ writing used for Vietnamese today. It may have been in use before independence, but its use since has waned. Hmong people living in Vietnam may be using a form of this inadvertently in writing Hmong based on Vietnamese. = Homer-Dixon Romanized Alphabet (Hmong Vietnamese) = This alphabet, published in 1939 by missionary Homera Homer-Dixon for the Hmong Leng, was never particularly popular, but was similar to Savina's romanization in many respects. The main differences involve the closer use of Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ writing, with an analogous convention of indicating tones with diacritics, as opposed to using tone letters, as in RPA systems.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 151. This script remains unused. = Nt∆°∆∞r Hm√¥ngz (Hmong Vietnamese RPA) = This was a Romanized style of writing Hmongic languages in Vietnam. It bears resemblance to the Qu·ªëc ng·ªØ writing used for Vietnamese today, but uses the tone letters, in similarity to RPA. This Vietnamese RPA script is only known to a few in Vietnam, predominantly of Christian faith, and it is thought that it will not be in use for much longer. = Hmong Lao scripts = This refers to the set of Hmong scripts that are based on the Lao alphabet, primarily used for transcribing the Green and White varieties of Hmong. Two versions are thought to have been initially developed. The first version was developed by Lor Fong, the brother of Hmong leader Fai Dang Lor, in 1948. After a meeting held by General Vang Pao at Long Tieng in 1964, a revised version was developed by Christian missionaries. It was used extensively in Laos before the communist takeover; however, its influence and use has waned. Apparently, people who are literate in Lao will not find too much trouble in reading and writing the script. It is known that there was a distinct Hmong Lao script supported by the Kingdom of Laos, and one supported by the Pathet Lao communists. The connection between the Pathet Lao-supported script and the script designed by Lor Fong, is not very clear, however. Since Fai Dang Lor is a known communist supporter, and since Vang Pao is a known supporter of the Royal Lao government, the selection and revision of the Hmong Lao script described in the previous paragraph is unclear in allegiance. If the Lor Fong script is indeed the Pathet Lao-supported script, there may only be one or two scripts that were created. If the Lor Fong script is the royalist-accepted script, then there may have been up to three Hmong Lao scripts created. Yet, as the Pathet Lao has been accused of widespread genocide of the Hmong people in coordination with the North Vietnamese armies, the Hmong Lao script remains widely unaccepted. Nonetheless, the contemporary system of transcribing Hmong in Lao may inadvertently still use a form of this script. = Whitelock systems (Hmong Lao/Thai) = This represents two scripts designed by Doris Whitelock, a missionary in the area during the 1960s and 1970s. She first developed a Thai-based system for writing Hmong in the 1960s. However, the Thai system was never widely used, even though Hmong people may be unconsciously be using a similar system in Thailand today. In the 1970s she developed a Lao-based system; however, this became the subject of widespread criticism, as it was considered a \\"Lao counterfeit,\\" and so was not adopted by the Hmong people of Laos.Duffy. (2012). p. 51 While neither system became popular, both are still used to an extent by missionaries working in Thailand and Laos, and people who can read the scripts may still exist. = Trung Script (Hmong Thai) = This system was published in 1932 by a Vietnamese missionary, C. K. Trung.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 150-151. The system uses Thai characters but reorients the system to fit the Hmong Leng language more closely. The system reportedly never gained much of a following. = Miao in Chinese Characters (Hmong Chinese) = In 1912, in Sichuan, a French officer named d'Ollone is said to have discovered some members of the Miao people reading and writing using Chinese characters, but they were allegedly very secretive about this script's existence and many members of the community vehemently denied it.Smalley, Vang & Yang. (1990). p. 149.  Working experimental scripts  A vast majority of experimental scripts are based in the United States of America, specifically in the Midwest, where there is a relatively large population of Hmong refugees, primarily from Laos and Vietnam. = Ntaw Cher Ze = This was developed by Cher Ze Xiong, who died in May 2013 in Chicago. He allegedly developed the script in the 1950s while still in Laos. His script is distinct in that he uses left radicals, as in Chinese, to indicate the meaning of the words, with right radicals, or syllables, to indicate the pronunciation. In this way, it represents a fusion of Chinese and Pallava-based alphasyllabaries. It is not known if anyone else could read the script. = New Mong = This script was developed by Ian James for writing Hmong Daw and Hmong Njua. It is based on Pallava script, from which a vast majority of scripts in Southeast Asia descend. He reportedly intended to represent what Hmong 'would have looked like' had Hmong followed the same evolutionary descent from Pallava. = Ntaw Nee Hmoo = This script was developed by Tchuyi Vang in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the 1990s. It is called Ntawv Neej Hmoob, or \\"Hmong Life Script\\" by the author. It allegedly includes influences of the Chinese language.  Unclassified scripts  = Qauv Ntaub Qauv Ntawv = This script has appeared over the Internet as the \\"Ancient Hmong Written Language\\" and is allegedly the reading guide to the Pa Ntau flower cloths referenced historically. It is, however, only being promoted in America, and based on Internet testimony, there seems to be Hmong schools in the United States who teach it in official settings, and Hmong female adults who teach it to their kids. Whether or not this transcription does represent the true transcription of the flower cloth is currently unverified by reliable, neutral sources. = Ntawv Hmoob 92 = This script supposedly contains consonants and vowels in the form of clan names, but this script has not properly been attributed in languages other than RPA Hmong, so international information is scarce. This script, however, is established enough to have a keyboard. Use of the keyboard is unknown. Additionally, its relationship to the purported Flower Cloth script mentioned above needs to be explored in greater depth, as the forms and strokes of characters in the two scripts bear some resemblance.

Morro da Mineira is situated on a hill and composed of simple houses inhabited by working class residents. This favela has experienced periods of extreme violence, due primarily to drug trafficking and conflict with the police force. Morro da Mineira's origins date back to the early twentieth century, when underprivileged people began occupying the hills in Rio de Janeiro in an attempt to stay closer to the city center.  History  The name \\"Morro da Mineira\\" was selected to honor an illustrious resident named, Maria da Silva Dias C√©sar.http://download.rj.gov.br/documentos/10112/556509/DLFE-66762.pdf/plano_historia_memoria.pdf She possessed a strong personality and moved from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro in the 1950s. Maria was the daughter of Manoel da Silva Dias, a Portuguese man from Ilha da Madeira, and Felizbina de Azevedo Dias. She had eight siblings: Adelina, Jo√£o Isaque, Daniel (Rio de Janeiro), Pedro (Manhumirim, MG), Azenate, Dorcas (Itabora√≠, RJ), and Alzira (Alto Capara√≥, MG). Although called a \\"Mineira\\" (person from the state of Minas Gerais), Maria was actually born in Rio de Janeiro, near Cantagalo and Cordeiro around 1910. Her family moved in Minas Gerais when she was very young and resided in the Alto Jequitib√° municipality. While living there, Maria met and married Laudelino C√©sar, with whom she had six children: Dario, En√©ias, Ciro, Leone, Dedier and Aluizio. Maria and her family lived in a very rural region with few resources and life there was difficult. After years of struggle, they moved to Rio de Janeiro in search of a better life. Life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro also proved challenging. There was limited access to medical care so, Maria became trained in midwifery. Through her work as a midwife, she became well-known and respected in the local community, who affectionately named her, \\"Dona Mineira\\" (\\"The Lady from Minas Gerais\\"). Maria died in 1980 and was buried at the S√£o Francisco de Paula cemetery in the Catumbi near her home. She is remembered fondly as a benefactor and, to honor her memory, the community where she lived adopted her nickname.

It is the author's longest and most ambitious novel, being an attempt to portray the whole of Peruvian life, by means of representations of geographic and social scenes of the entire country, although its focus is on the Andean sierra. The title alludes to the racial, regional and cultural diversity of the Peruvian nation. The novel revolves around two fundamental ideas: the danger of imperialist penetration into the country through large transnational companies, and the problem of modernization of the indigenous world. Plot The novel starts with the suicide of Don Andres Aragon of Peralta, head of the most powerful family in the village of San Pedro de Lahuaymarca, in the mountains of Peru. His death announces the end of the feudal system that until then has been predominant in the region. Don Andres leaves two sons: Don Fermin and Don Bruno, enemies and rivals, who during the life of their father had already divided his vast property. The principal conflict revolves around the exploitation of the Apar'cora mine, discovered by Don Fermin on his lands. Don Fermin, a prototypical national capitalist, wants to exploit the mine and bring progress to the region, which his brother Don Bruno opposes. Don Bruno is a traditional landowner and fanatical Catholic, who doesn't want his tenant farmers or Indian slaves contaminated by modernity, which, according to his judgment, corrupts people. With the arrival of an international consortium - Wisther-Bozart- a dispute over control of the silver mine begins. Don Fermin cannot compete against the enormous transnational corporation, and sees himself forced to sell the mine, which then adopts the name Aparcora Mining Company. Anticipating the need for abundant water to work the mine, the company shows interest in the lands of the town and the neighboring rural communities, requiring that they be sold at ridiculously low prices; this counts on the complicity of corrupt authorities. The company acts as a disintegrating force that does everything necessary to maximize profit, without regard to the damages caused to the townspeople. Then there begins a process of unrest that leads to the mobilisation of peasants led by Rendon Willka, an Indian rebel who has lived in the capital of the country where he has learnt a lot. Under his orders uprisings explode, which are bloodily repressed by forces supporting the government, but which are the forerunners of the final rebellion. Characters = Main = * Don Andr√©s Arag√≥n y Peralta is the old man mentioned at the beginning of the story. He is the head of the most powerful family of the village of San Pedro de Lahuaymarca, a typically feudal region of the Peruvian mountains. In his proudest moment, Don Andres captures a lot of land, displacing other big landowners or feudal lords, as well as Indian rebels. Later he becomes an alcoholic and his family environment disintegrates: his children quarrel among themselves and his wife, disappointed by her family, also starts drinking. Before committing suicide by ingesting poison, Don Andr√©s curses his two sons, Don Fermin and Don Bruno, whom he accuses of illegally appropriating his properties, and in his will, he bequeaths his last possessions to the Indians. * Don Ferm√≠n Arag√≥n de Peralta is a cold businessman, a representative of national capitalism. Ambitious and obsessed by economic power, he aspires to bring economic progress into the mountains, displacing the traditional order. He believes modernization is necessary to achieve a change in Peru, but with a dose of nationalism. However, he cannot compete with a mining transnational to whom he sells his silver mine. With the money obtained he ventures in the fishing industry, buying flour mills and fish canneries in the port of Supe. He also decides to expand and modernize his mountain estate \\"La Esperanza\\". At the end of the novel he will be wounded by a shot from his own brother, Don Bruno. * Don Bruno Arag√≥n de Peralta is the landowner of the \\"La Providencia\\" estate, where he has tenant farmers and Indian slaves. He is violent with his workers, whom he hits and whips without mercy, and sexually abuses the women, the latter being his favourite sport. Against the arrival of modernisation, he defends the maintenance of the feudal system, because he believes that only this ensures that his Indians remain \\"pure\\", away from the corruption of money, a position with which he confronts his elder brother, Don Fermin. He is also a religious fanatic who considers that the preservation of said traditional system is a divine order that must be carried out. In the middle of the novel, and after knowing and impregnating a half-caste named Vicenta, he produces a change in his behaviour: he dedicates himself to doing good, distributing his lands to indigenous people and helping other rebels in their struggles against the overlords. He ends as righteous, executing the wicked overlord Don Lucas and trying to murder his brother, which will lead him to prison. * Demetrio Rend√≥n Willka is an Indian or free rebel from Lahuaymarca. He is a serene, wise, patient, lucid, brave, astute, heroic and chaste man. He represents the new consciousness of the Indians, those who expect to break with the antiquated social structure, but preserving its more positive aspects, like the social community, with the aim of counteracting the harmful effects of the imminent modernisation. He represents then an option for development in contrast with the planned modernisation of Don Fermin and the defence of the old feudal system of Don Bruno. Rendon Wilka is the first son of comuneros who arrives in Lima, where he lives in slums for 8 years, working as a road sweeper, servant, textile and construction worker. He learns to read at night-school and spends time in prison, where he has a political-religious realisation. All that experience makes him feel a new man and he returns to his land determined to lead the fight for the liberation of the Indians. He arrives in the town soon after the death of Don Andres and puts himself at the service of Don Fermin as foreman of the mine. Later Don Bruno names him as administrator of his estate \\"La Providencia\\". Finally, he leads the uprising of the Indians and his end is heroic because he dies, shot by the forces of order. = Secondary = * The kurku Gertrude, a hunchbacked dwarf who is raped by don Bruno, as a result of which she aborts a foetus with bristles. * Vincenta, the wife of Don Bruno, from whom she has a son, the boy Alberto. * Matilde, the blond wife of Don Fermin, a \\"cute and sweet\\" lady. * Nemesio Carhuamayo, first foreman of the Indians on Don Bruno's \\"La Providencia\\" estate. * Policarpo Coello, second foreman of the \\"La Providencia\\" Indians. * Adri√°n K‚Äôoto, first ringleader of the \\"La Providencia\\" Indian slaves. * Santos K‚Äôoyowasi, second ringleader of \\"La Providencia\\" Indian slaves. * Justo Pariona, Indian driller at the mine. * Anto, servant of Don Andres.

Analysis The novel presents the image of a nation subjected to imperialist penetration and, above all, the problem of modernization of indigenous culture. Arguedas attempts to provide a comprehensive portrait of Peru by the representation of geographic and social settings throughout the country, although the narrative focus is on the sierra. The title of the novel expresses the complex national life of Peru, in which 'all bloods' intermingle and compete with each other harshly. But this fight envelops not only Peru but also an imperialist power seeking to manipulate it.Jessica Tapia Soriano, reader's guide in El Comercio. The confrontation between the forces of modernity and a traditional society is the main conflict that the novel addresses. Its large question revolves around the possibility of achieving genuine national development, with the certainty that a historical era of the country has ended, and that a new homeland must be built on its ruins. The destroyed order is the old feudal order. The alternatives facing the imperialist project range from a utopian return to a feudal order, imagined by Don Bruno as a natural system presided by moral principles, to a proposal of national capitalism, as stated by Don Fermin. In the novel these options are invalidated and the moral and historical legitimacy of the other alternative, represented by the rebel Rendon Willka, is emphasized. This alternative could be summarized by his collectivist sensibility (in the social sphere), in his adherence to Quechua values (in the cultural sphere), and a cautious modernization (at both levels). Willka's project, however, has some components which are more idealistic than realistic, and contains perhaps an insurmountable failing: it is a project limited to the rural highlands, that distrusts and even rejects participation of the proletariat and calls into question the service of political parties. It is a project more cultural than social (although it brings into relief the importance of collectivist organization under the model of indigenous community), and more ethical than political. In any case, during the course of the novel a consistent reflection on many aspects of Peruvian reality unfolds: in this process, precisely because it is reflective, the novel observes the impossibility of understanding the national dynamics, made up of familiar oppositions, at the margins of the overall structure of the contemporary world.Antonio Cornejo Polar, pp. 130-131. Controversy over the work In 1965 the Institute for Peruvian Studies (Instituto de Estudios Peruanos) organized a series of roundtables to discuss the relationship between literature and sociology. The second of these, held on June 23, devoted itself to the discussion of the novel Todas las sangres, with the participation of Arguedas himself. This event was extremely important because it signified the incorporation of Arguedas' narrative into a discussion of the literature of his time. The roundtable consisted of leftist intellectuals who were admirers of Arguedas. All of them, some cautiously and others openly, criticized the work because it was thought to be a distorted version of Peruvian society: starting with the description of a caste system which had long disappeared in the whole of the Peruvian Andes, and a primitive and caricatural view of social mechanisms. These reviews were devastating for Arguedas, who, according to Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote later that night these heartbreaking lines: > ... it was almost proved by two wise sociologists and an economist, [...] > that my book Todas las sangres is detrimental to the country, I don't have > anything to do in this world anymore. My forces have declined, I think, > inevitably.Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 261-263. Criticism According to Vargas Llosa, the criticisms that were made regarding the work during the roundtable of June 23, 1965 would be valid from a sociological point of view. Obviously, another point of view would be an analysis of the novel as literary fiction. Vargas Llosa argues that the work is also flawed in this respect, that the description of Peruvian society is profoundly false and unconvincing, not because of distance from objective truth, but because of a lack of internal force emanating from the intricacies of the fiction.Vargas Llosa 1996, p. 264. By contrast, the British critic and poet Martin Seymour-Smith praised the novel highly: > \\"Those who by temperament reject the horrors of machinery and man's misuse > of it will find rich reward in this, the most poetic of all novels about > 'savages'. If Levi-Strauss is a great thinker, and he is (at his best), then > what can Arguedas be? Something infinitely larger, certainly.\\"Martin > Seymour-Smith, The New Guide to Modern World Literature (New York: Peter > Bedrick Books, 1985) p. 950 Message Arguedas' novel reveals his proposed solution to indigenous problems: Andean culture must not be destroyed, as part of some or other form of modernization that assimilates. Harmonious thinking with nature is accepted, in order to develop a revolutionary mindset that projects a future of well-being and freedom. The national ideal is that of multivariate Peru, with ecological, multicultural and multilingual diversity.as witnessed in the Peruvian Constitution of 1993, which aims to preserve diversity of customs, alternative medicine, languages etc. The Peruvian nation can be seen as being more than a national project; it can be said that there are several national cores, but they are not geographically localizable. In the intellectual underworld of Peru, bound to political power, is a subsidiary Western worldview, strongly refuted and distorted by current social historical reality. Film adaptation The film adaptation of the novel was directed by Michel Gomez in 1987. The actors Richardo Tosso, Rafael Delucchi, Pilar Brescia, Andres Alencastre, Oswaldo Sivirichi and Juan Manuel Ochoa appear in the cast. Notes References * Arguedas, Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas (2001).

Probably built in the late 1720s, it is a well-preserved example of Georgian architecture. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Whidden Ward House is located on the southwest side of High Street, southeast of its junction with Deer Street. It is located in an area known as The Hill, a cluster of historic properties south of Deer Street which was created as part of a road widening project. It is a 2-1/2 story L-shaped wood frame structure, with a gabled and hipped roof and clapboarded exterior. A single brick chimney is located at one end. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a four-light transom and a pedimented gable. The first-floor windows are topped by gables. The interior has a particularly fine carved Georgian staircase, with an arched window at the landing. The house is thought to have been built in the early 1720s by Michael Whidden, a joiner, and was originally located on Deer Street, an area that was platted for development in 1712. After his death in 1773 the house was purchased by Nathum Ward, who extensively renovated the property, giving it most of its surviving late-Georgian appearance. The only major addition to the house was a 19th-century leanto extension to the rear. The building was moved to its present location in the 1970s, and is now in commercial use.

History In the mid and late 2000s, Bob Sinclar and Yves Larock created international hits which had many characteristics of tropical house, drawing inspiration from 1980's Hi-NRG music and in contrast with other sub-types of Electronic (\\"EDM\\") music of the time. In 2012, Unicorn Kid had created tropical rave, a faster form of the genre which would become known as tropical house. However, it was not until 2013 with Klangkarussell's \\"Sun Don't Shine\\" and the emergence of producers such as Kygo and Robin Schulz that tropical house became a dance music trend. During 2014 and 2015, producers such as Lost Frequencies, Felix Jaehn, Alex Adair, Sam Feldt, Bakermat, Klingande and Faul & Wad Ad would join them with big tropical house hits. Artists such as Justin Bieber helped the genre achieve massive commercial success during the mid 2010s. https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2015/6804537/justin- bieber-omi-kygo-lillywood-robin-schulz-mr-probs-tropical-house-hits-2015  Characteristics  Tropical house is a subgenre of deep house, which is itself a subgenre of house music. Thus, it possesses typical house music characteristics, including synthesizer instrumentation, and a 4/4 kick drum pattern. Tropical house differentiates itself from deep house, which can often have a very dark sound, whereas tropical house can be described as having a more uplifting and relaxing sound. The tempo of tropical house songs is a little slower than deep house (100-115 bpm). Tropical house does not use the pumping compression effect of \\"big room\\" electro house. It usually includes tropical instruments such as steel drums, marimba, guitar, saxophone or even pan flute, and can sometimes use dembow rhythm patterns often attributed to genres such as dancehall and reggaeton.

He first represented India at the inaugural 2010 Youth Olympics where he won a bronze medal in the boys' freestyle 100 kg category. He then represented India in the 2014 Commonwealth Games and won a silver medal in the 97 kg weight class.  Personal life  He is the son of Satyawan Kadian, an Arjuna Awardee and 1988 Summer Olympics Olympian. Having trained in the akhada run under his father, he broke into the national camp in 2012 after a stellar performance at the 2012 Nationals in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh. In 2014, Chief coach Vinod Kumar, who was a teammate of his father's during the 1988 Olympics, is confident that Kadian, competing in a higher weight category will ensure him medals. \\"It is rare for us to get a wrestler who is competing for medals regularly in the higher weight divisions. We are very lucky to have Satyawart. And the best part is he is only 20 years old. If we keep working on him we are sure he will become one of the mainstays of this team in the years to come.\\" Satyawart dreams of emulating Olympic wrestler Sushil Kumar in the future. He is married to Sakshi Malik.  Career  = 2010 Youth Olympic Games = Kadian's first major medal at an international event was when he won the bronze medal in the boys' freestyle 100 kg category at the debut Youth Olympics in Singapore, announcing himself to the Indian wrestling community and to the world. = 2013 World Youth Wrestling Championships = Kadian rose to prominence in the 2013 World Youth Wrestling Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria when he became the only Indian wrestler to return home with a medal, albeit the bronze one. It was a tough road for the Indian to the semis, having beaten an Iranian and a Kazakh to line up against Viktor Kazishvili of the United States of America. Unfortunately the young wrestler was unable to overcome the American and came up against Ali Bonceoglu of Turkey in the bronze medal match where he succeeded in overcoming the wily Turkish wrestler. Battling an ankle injury during the semi-final and bronze medal bouts, Kadian said his motivation to win a meal was the lean returns from the wrestling contingent. \\"The first few days were not good for us. We didn't win a medal in freestyle and Greco-Roman. I wanted to end this barren spell and win a medal at any cost. After the first round I felt in good form. In the bronze-medal match I desperately wanted to register a victory,\\" said the 18 year old in an interview with the Times of India. In the build-up to the tournament, Kadian trained with Olympic medallists Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt at the senior national wrestling camp in Sonepat. Raj Singh, secretary general of the Wrestling Federation of India (at that time) attributed Kadian's success in Sofia to his eagerness to learn and easy interaction with senior wrestlers. = 2014 Asian Wrestling Championships = Kadian's first foray into the senior wrestling team earned him immediate rewards. His Round of 16 match-up was against Umidjon Ismanov of Uzbekistan whom he beat 7-3 in the first period itself. He then lost to Magomed Musaev of Kyrgyzstan 3-0 but qualified for the repechage round to face Chanuk Yook of South Korea whom he beat 7-0 in a thumping contest. In the bronze medal match, he was able to overcome Alihan Djumaev of Kazakhstan and won the bronze medal, beating the Kazakh grappler 6-6, with the Indian winning because of last point scored. = 2014 Commonwealth Games = Competing in the 97 kg weight class, Kadian's first opponent was Manjula Uduwila Arachchige of Sri Lanka, beating him 4-0 in the Round of 16. He faced Soso Tamarau of Nigeria in the quarter-finals and won 3-1 in a close match. Reaching the semi- finals, Kadian was up against home favourite Leon Rattigan of England whom he closed out with an easy 3-1 win. The finals bout was an exciting clash against Arjun Gill of Canada where the Indian disappointingly lost 1-3 to settle for the silver medal. = 2014 Asian Games = Kadian continued to compete in the 97 kg weight class and began his Asian Games campaign with a match-up against Magomed Musaev of Kyrgyzstan, losing 1-3 in the first round itself. He was able to redeem himself in the rep√™chage round, beating his opponent Bilal Hussain Awad of Pakistan 4-0 there. That pushed him into the bronze medal match where he unfortunately lost 3-0 to Mamed Ibragimov of Kazakhstan. = Other events =  Rustam-e-International Dangal Wrestling tournament  In honour of the Indian festival of Navratri, the 1st Rustam-e-International tournament was held in Katra, Jammu and ended on 22 October 2015. Participants from England, Belarus and Ukraine competed in the tournament which took place in the Vivekanand Stadium in Katra. Kadian was the 3rd Indian wrestler taking part in the tournament along with Binia Bin and Parvindra. The latter wrestlers beat Ukrainian wrestler Myhailo Datsenko and English wrestler Leon Rattigan respectively, whom Kadian had beaten last year at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The 21 year old won the title along with a cash prize, a trophy belt and a medal, beating Belarussian wrestler Ihor Didyk.

Fishel joined Robert Edwards in 1975 and eventually worked alongside Edwards and Patrick Steptoe, the duo that successfully pioneered conception through IVF, leading to the birth of Louise Brown on 25 July 1978.  Early life and education  Simon Brian Fishel was born to a Jewish family in Liverpool and grew up close to Calderstones Park. His father, Joseph, was a tailor and his mother, Jane, was one of 12 siblings from a family of Eastern European refugees. Fishel was educated at King David High School, Liverpool, where he became Head Boy. After securing A-Levels, Fishel initially taught at a school in Speke, on the outskirts of Liverpool. He then studied Physiology and Biochemistry at the University of Salford, graduating in 1975 with double first-class BSc Honours. Fishel moved to the University of Cambridge after being appointed to a PhD position in virology, but soon decided that a career studying viruses was not for him. He then met future Nobel Prize-winner Robert Edwards, under whose supervision he would gain a PhD and find a field to which he would commit his life's work. In 1978, Fishel was appointed as a Don at Churchill College, Cambridge and was also awarded the Beit Memorial Foundation Fellowship.  Career  At Cambridge, Fishel worked with Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe for a number of years before the birth of the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. This success made medical history, establishing in vitro fertilisation as a new treatment option that could help infertile couples have children. While continuing his work at Cambridge, Fishel was appointed as Deputy Scientific Director at the world's first IVF clinic, Bourn Hall, joining Scientific Director Edwards, Medical Director Steptoe and Deputy Medical Director John Webster in 1980. During these controversial early years of IVF, Fishel and his colleagues received extensive opposition from critics both outside of and within the medical and scientific communities, including a civil writ for murder. Fishel has since stated that \\"the whole establishment was outraged\\" by their early work and that people thought that he was \\"potentially a mad scientist\\". 300px In 1981, Fishel, Robert Edwards and other colleagues at Bourn Hall organised the first international IVF conference, which was attended by pioneering clinicians and scientists from around the world. Shortly after this, Fishel's colleague Robert Edwards would co-found the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and establish the journal Human Reproduction to enable greater reporting of developments and breakthroughs in the field. Fishel's work has included numerous breakthroughs. One of his earliest contributions was to move away from test tubes (hence the term 'test-tube baby') and towards the use of petri dishes with culture medium overlaid with paraffin oil in the practice of clinical embryology, a step which made it more practical when IVF was eventually used to retrieve multiple eggs during ovarian stimulation for the purpose of producing multiple follicles. Fishel demonstrated for the first time that human embryos secrete the pregnancy hormone hCG in a 1984 publication with Edwards and Chris Evans in Science that has been cited 196 times and identified by Outi Hovatta as the first description of the potential of IVF and stem cell technology in terms of medicinal benefit. He also demonstrated the need to permanently immobilise the sperm tail for successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In the 1980s, Fishel sought out Falmouth-based micro-electronics firm Research Instruments to help him develop tools for the earliest beginnings of sperm microinjection. However, British regulators would not grant Fishel a licence for a pilot scheme, meaning he had to pioneer the technique, known as sub- zonal insemination (SUZI), in Italy. In Rome, Fishel and his team reported the first birth from SUZI in 1990, which was televised by Italian television station Rai Uno, and described a clinical pregnancy rate of 15 per cent from 225 SUZI cycles a year later. As the first micro-insemination technique for treating male infertility, SUZI was a novel technology that allowed men with poor semen parameters and no other chance of achieving fertilisation to father their own genetic children. It was licensed as a technique in Britain in 1991, with the first SUZI birth in the UK taking place in September 1992 at the Park Hospital in Nottingham. Fishel and colleagues went on to offer direct injection of sperm into the cytoplasm of the oocyte, or ‚ÄòDISCO‚Äô, as an alternative treatment for patients for whom SUZI had failed. These techniques would eventually be developed into intracytoplasmic sperm injection, while Research Instruments would go on to provide IVF equipment and technology to clinics around the world. Fishel introduced embryo vitrification to the UK in 1991, with the first baby to be born in the country from this technique being delivered in October 1992. However, this procedure was then initially banned by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), a decision later criticised by Fishel when he gave a supplementary memorandum in parliament in 1997 as part of the Draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. Fishel has published more than 200 papers, as well as a number of books, including the 1986 bestseller In Vitro Fertilisation: Past Present and Future. In 1987, he was part of the first team invited by the World Health Organization to introduce IVF to mainland China. Together with Steven D. Fleming, in 1992 Fishel established the world's first master's degree courses in assisted reproduction technology at the University of Nottingham, where he had already opened a fertility service. Fishel co-founded independent specialist CARE Fertility in 1997 to provide fertility services to private and NHS patients. Fishel has received honorary awards from countries such as Japan, South Africa, Austria and Italy, and has advised numerous international governments, as well as the Vatican. In 2009, he received an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for his \\"outstanding contributions to the field of fertility treatment, including embryology and IVF\\". Fishel was named at number ten in the '100 hottest health gurus' by women's health and wellbeing magazine Top Sant√© in its September 2013 issue, selected due to his co-creation of the time-lapse embryo imaging process CAREmaps, a development Fishel himself called the most exciting and significant since he began his career. In a November 2013 issue of the journal Reproductive BioMedicine Online, Fishel called for the NHS to permit its IVF patients to take part in privately funded trials of new additional techniques, adding that the current position was \\"preventing progress\\".  Media appearances  Fishel has frequently appeared in the media and is regularly interviewed, featured and quoted in the British press. Notable examples include: * Appearing in Channel 4's 1999 documentary 'The Babymakers' to discuss the history of male-factor fertility treatment. * Writing a guest article for and being interviewed by BBC News Online on the subject of so-called 'saviour siblings'. * Appearing in CNN's three-part 'Vital Signs' documentary to discuss the history of IVF and the latest technology. * Interviews on Ireland's TV3 and with The Daily Telegraph about the time-lapse embryo imaging process, CAREmaps. * An interview with ITV News on a new embryo chromosome test being offered by CARE Fertility. * A debate in The Guardian with journalist Catherine Bennett over proposals to make fertility treatment available on the NHS.  Personal life  Fishel lives in Nottingham and has four children and one grandchild. His second-eldest child is the musician, producer and record label owner Matt Fishel. He is a supporter of Liverpool F.C.. In 1993, Fishel was nominated by readers of the Liverpool Echo as one of Merseyside's 'top 100 living legends'. On 17 October 2000, Fishel was on board the train involved in the Hatfield rail crash. He escaped with minor injuries and helped assist other passengers at the scene before emergency services arrived. Fishel established research-based charity The Rachel Foundation in 2001 with the aim of developing and improving treatments for people left infertile from medical side effects.

Centro's emagazine Centro Voices disseminates creative and scholarly contributions about the Puerto Rican experiences in the United States to a general public.  Conferences and seminars  Centro regularly sponsors conferences and seminars that highlight the Puerto Rican experience. These include: Claiming the Center Stage: Critical Perspectives on Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in the U.S., cosponsored with the Dominican Studies Institute (DSI) of City College, focusing on timely issues affecting the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities in New York; Symposium: 100 Years of the Jones Act and Puerto Rican U.S. Citizenship, examining the history and legacy of the collective naturalization of Puerto Ricans as United States citizens; and the video conference Puerto Ricans in Cyberspace, a look at Puerto Ricans in social media.  Education  Centro‚Äôs education programs seek to develop educational products that motivate students and teachers nationwide to become involved in Puerto Rican Studies and that provide the necessary supports for success, and encourage historical preservation. To help promote these products, Centro has produced brochures describing the exhibition materials available to groups and schools. The brochures describe the exhibits, films, and posters, which are primarily used as instructional material.  Events and outreach  Centro sponsors cultural and educational activities that contribute to the study and interpretation of the Puerto Rican experience in the United States. These activities are designed to support the teaching and learning of Puerto Rican Studies, develop and promote Centro's archival collections.

However, a relatively modern variation of the pheran extends to below the knees, which is worn with a suthan inside (loose form of shalwar) similar to the styles worn in Afghanistan. It is optional to wear the suthan with a long phiran as traditionally lower garments are not worn with pherans. The traditional pheran do not have side slits. According to some sources, the pheran was introduced by Mughal emperor Akbar when he conquered the valley in 1586. In summer, the pheran are made of cotton, but in winter, the pheran is made of wool, covering and protecting the body from the cold especially during snow. These dresses are used by the residents of the Kashmir valley and Kashmiris residing in Chenab Valley. A young man wearing Pheran somewhere in Chenab Valley's Doda district Etymology There is no consensus as to the origin of the word 'pheran'. However, it seems that the word is a corruption of the Persian word 'perahan' which means shirt. The outfit has been in vogue in Kashmir since before the 15th century. Design =Head dress= Hindu women use a \\"taranga\\" ( Kashmiri : ÿ™Ÿéÿ±ŸïŸÜŸõ⁄ØŸï€Å /tar…®ng…®/), a headdress which becomes smaller down at back, towards the heels. Kashmiri Muslim women use a red headwear known as the \\"kasaba\\" ( Kashmiri : ⁄©Ÿéÿ≥ÿßÿ®Ÿï€Å /kasaÀêb…®/). The kasaba is padded by means of a turban and is pinned together by brooches. A pin-scarf revoked from the kasaba descends towards the neck. =Pheran= The pheran is a loose upper garment loosely gathered at the sleeves which tend to be wide, made of either wool or jamewar which is a mixture of wool and cotton, with no side slits. A pheran made of wool is called a 'loch'. Female pheran dresses are designed with colorful flower like designed elements and styles. Male pheran dresses are quite simple without any colourful designs. The traditional pheran falls to the feet like a gown which was universally worn by the Hindu and Muslim communities into the later 19th century C.E. However, a modern version is knee-length and is worn by Muslim people which is loose and stitched at the front side and on the finishes while Hindu people wear their pherans long, extending down their legs.

It is generally used to save the pheran from burns due to kangri. It also provides extra heat during winters, double layered protection, from the cold winter days. =Suthan/shalwar= Traditionally, the pheran and poots were worn without a lower garment.Cultural Heritage of India- Kashmiri Pandit Contribution.

His collection was later transferred to the Luton Museum. Of Elliott, the British ornithologist Bruce Campbell stated: \\"On June 4th, 1903, Jannion Steele-Elliott, the great Bedfordshire naturalist and his friend Ronald Bruce Campbell, my father, spent the day at Southill Park and found nests with eggs of 27 different species of bird, a feat which can have few parallels in British field ornithology.\\" Elliott was a Tring correspondent (1899‚Äì1942) and records of his ornithological work are kept in the archives of the Natural History Museum.

The film was directed by Lev Kuleshov and produced by the Soviet production company Goskino. The narrative is based on the Jack London short story \\"The Unexpected\\". The plot concerns a group of gold prospectors in the Yukon region of Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush. Plot A group of five gold miners originally from Western Europe find a large deposit in the Yukon. One, after being made to act as a servant, having his food stolen and ridiculed, enters the cabin with a rifle for hunting or protection and, in a moment of madness, shoots dead two of his comrades. The remaining two, a married couple, disarm him but have the dilemma of whether to administer justice themselves or risk waiting for the thaw and then trying to return to civilization to render the offender to the public court. Cast *Alexandra Khokhlova as Edith Nelson *Szergei Komarov as Hans Nelson *Vladimir Fogel as Michael Dennin *Pyotr Galadzhev as Harkey *Porfiri Podobed *Fred Forell as Jack Production After trying his filmmaking skills in different genres, Lev Kuleshov decided to make a film using minimal resources and a strictly limited number of actors. After reading the Jack London short story \\"The Unexpected\\", he with Viktor Shklovsky wrote a script based on the narrative. Kuleshov and co-screenwriter Shklovsky initially thought that the studio would be interested in a low-budget feature with three actors in one setting but the script was rejected and only after an article appeared in support of the picture in the magazine \\"Soviet Screen\\" was the film greenlit. For the role of Edith Nelson Lev Kuleshov cast his wife, actress Aleksandra Khokhlova. The filming was done in the Moscow Oblast, not far from the Tsaritsynsky ponds. The shore of the Moscow River and two trees near the water created the illusion of the wild northern Yukon. On the riverside, a house of prospectors was placed in which the interior scenes were shot. Shooting conditions were extremely difficult; cold winter scenes were shot in April and inundation occurred. The decoration of the house was flooded, the crew was knee-deep in water and actors often faced electric shocks because of the damaged insulation of the wires. Reception The film was received positively abroad in non English speaking countries; in Anglo- regions it was released only in 1939. Interesting facts *Original script of the picture was called \\"Three.\\" *For the shooting of the film high and warm \\"American\\" boots were sewn for Alexandra Khokhlova which the actress enjoyed so much that after she finished working on the film she ended up keeping them for herself. *In the course of working on the film various alternative endings were examined, but eventually it was decided to leave Dennin alive.

History The land comprising several lots situated on Main Street below Third Street was granted on August 31, 1847, by the Ayuntamiento of the pueblo of Los Angeles, to Juan Bouvette and Loreta Cota, his wife. On March 3, 1854, it was purchased by Remundo Alexander and Maria Valdez, his wife. Alexander was a native of France, and came to California as a sailor. In Africa, he had seen houses of stone built in cylindrical form. When he got married, this prompted him to vary the uniform style of building in Spanish-American countries by fashioning the adobe dwelling for his bride after the architecture of Africa. For a time they lived in the house. On July 28, 1856, it was sold to George Lehman and his wife, Clara Snyder. Lehman was a native of Germany, familiarly known to his fellow-citizens as \\"Dutch George\\" or \\"Round House George\\". He was described as a good-natured, kind-hearted, well-meaning man, full of vagaries and fantastic notions. Lehman had a strange hallucination that he had found the Garden of Eden, and he set to work to make his grounds as nearly as possible his conception of the dwelling place of Adam and Eve. He fitted up the grounds for a pleasure resort, and the building for a saloon. The grounds were referred to then as the Garden of Eden and Lehman named the resort the Garden of Paradise. The public garden was frequented especially on Sundays. This garden became a thicket of foliage and bloom to which Lehman charged a small admission fee; and he sold beer and pretzels in the shade. A music band was stationed on the balcony of the Round House and played at intervals. For more than twenty years, this garden was one of the resorts of the town, and was used on public occasions, notably the country's centennial celebration of July 4, 1876. Lehman contracted debts he could not pay and on March 6, 1879, it passed out of his possession, sold under foreclosure of mortgage. The cactus hedge was cut down in July, 1886, when the city ordered the laying of cement sidewalks. The building was used as a school house after Lehman left it. Founded by Emma Marwedel, it was home to Southern California‚Äôs first kindergarten, and its first teacher was Kate Douglas Wiggin. It was later a lodging house, and its last use was a dwelling for tramps. The Round House was torn down in 1889. Architecture Main entrance Alexander varied the uniform style of building in Spanish-American countries and fashioned the new adobe dwelling after the architecture of Africa. The building was two stories high, with an umbrella-shaped shingle roof. The walls were deep. Mrs. Alexander thought it cost, with the lawn, from US$15,000-$20,000. After Lehman came into possession of the Round House he enlarged it by enclosing it in a frame extension about deep, which on the exterior was an octagon, and in the interior divided into additional rooms. Over the windows, he painted the names of the thirteen original States, with that of California added. Grounds Entrance gate on Spring Street The building stood on lots 311, 313, 315, and 317 fronting on Main Street and running through to Spring Street. Its exact location was south of Third Street. The Main Street front of the Garden was later occupied by the Pinney Block, the Pridham Block and Turnverein Hall. On the Spring Street front, lots 308, 310, 312, and 314, was a thick cactus hedge which barred entrance to the grounds from that street. The entrance to the garden was guarded by a row of tunas (Prickly-pear cacti), which extended across the Main and Spring streets sides that grew from high. Lehman planted shade-giving pepper trees, and built a labyrinth of arbors, which in time were hidden under a profusion of vines and roses. He planted fruit and ornamental trees, shrubbery and plants. There were statues of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, a serpent and golden apples, as well as a frame work for flying horses for the amusement of children. Scattered about under the trees were effigies in cement of the animals which passed in review before Adam to receive their names.

The company also produces several modern-day productions in non theatrical venues such as their courtroom shows of Inherit the Wind and A Few Good Men in the Hoboken Municipal Courtroom. It produce a yearly educational program that ranges from student workshops to full length Shakespeare productions.  History  In 1992, Jersey City native L. Robert \\"Luther\\" Johnson decided to mount a staged reading of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" in Hamilton Park in Jersey City. Having worked as a technical consultant for such companies as Riverside Shakespeare and New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players in New York, Johnson remarked \\"I noticed that when you were on one side of the Hudson you couldn't walk five feet without finding a company of actors doing Shakespeare, but on this side of the river there was nothing.\\" He partnered with several theatrical friends who he had worked with previously in such community theaters as the Park Players of Union City and Civic Theater of Hudson County in Jersey City for this first production under the banner of \\"Hudson Shakespeare Company\\", named after Hudson County. While this first production featured \\"13 people on stage and 5 in the audience, he was undeterred and continued to produce Shakespeare under \\"Hudson Shakespeare Company\\" and modern works such as Driving Miss Daisy and Waiting for Godot under \\"Patchwork Theater Company\\". In 1996, Johnson met fellow actor and director Jon Ciccarelli and the two reorganized all of the classical and modern productions under \\"Hudson Shakespeare Company\\".

Shakespeare workshops have included: * Shakespeare Scene study ‚Äì (Basic breaking down of text and staging monologues and scenes) * Early Modern Theater, Recreating Shakespeare's Theater (Using practices that were utilized during Shakespeare's day such as cue scripts) * Shakespeare on Film and On-Camera scene study (staging scenes using on-camera techniques) * Unarmed Stage Combat (Instruction on falls, punches, slaps and other stage combat not involving weaponry * Armed Stage Combat (Instruction in fighting with stage weaponry such as different types of swords) Among the educational institutions that the group has worked with are St. Mary's High School and Kenmare High School in Jersey City, Fort Lee High School, David Brearly Middle School (Kenilworth), David Schectner Middle School (West Orange), the Hackensack Cultural Arts Center/Hackensack High School and Misericordia University (Dallas, Pennsylvania).  Notable mentions  In 1998, the company produced A Midsummer Night's Dream as the first live theatrical performance held at the newly dedicated Frank Sinatra Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 2005, company founder L. Robert Johnson was honored with the \\"Everyday Hero Award\\" by the newspaper The Jersey Journal. These awards and related feature article chronicle everyday citizens of Hudson County with outstanding contributions to their communities. In Mr. Johnson's case it was for his founding of Hudson Shakespeare Company and promotion of Shakespeare in Hudson County along with spearheading several educational programs mentoring novice acting students. In 2009, the company was nominated for several awards including for stage fight choreography and costuming in the New York Midtown International Theatre Festival for its production of The Sword Politik by Jon Crefeld. The company was noted in the New Cambridge edition (2012) of The Two Noble Kinsmen as one of several companies throughout the world that had produced the little done play. New Jersey City University professor, James Broderick, profiled several Hudson Shakespeare Company actors in his book Greatness Thrust Upon Them: Non-Professional Actors and Directors Discuss Their Encounters with Shakespeare. (2014). The book chronicled the actors' first experiences with the Bard, the intimidation and overcoming these hurdles to fully embrace the work and how it shaped their semi-professional and professional careers In 2015, the company produced Arden of Faversham as the first live show for the newly opened Atlantic Street Park in Hackensack, New Jersey.

Biography Stedman was born at Zutphen in 1778, the son of William George Stedman (a naturalised Dutchman of Scottish descent), and a Dutch mother of noble blood. Stedman received a commission in the Dutch army when only a child. At the early age of sixteen he first saw service with the allied forces, under Frederick, Duke of York and the Prince of Orange (afterwards King William I of the Netherlands) which were employed in 1794 on the northern frontier of France. Stedman's next service was in 1799, when the Batavian Republic was in alliance with France, and the Duke of York commanded the opposing army at Bergen. At a later date he again served against the British at Walcheren. Meanwhile he had held important staff appointments, and, on the incorporation of the Netherlands with France, he became general of brigade in the French army. In this capacity he served for two years in Italy, and was in 1813 present at the battles of Bautzen and Dresden. In 1814 he attached himself to the Prince of Orange (afterwards King William II of the Netherlands), and commanded the Dutch troops in the reserve during the Battle of Waterloo, with the rank of lieutenant-general. He died at Nijmegen in 1833. Family Stedman married Nicola Gertrude van de Poll, granddaughter of the last reigning burgomaster of Amsterdam. Their only son, Charles John William Stedman, became a Prussian subject, settling at Besselich Abbey, near Coblentz. He was a member of the national assemblies of Frankfurt am Main and Erfurt, and received the title of freiherr (baron). He had a large family, of which nearly all the sons entered the Queen Augusta Regiment of Guards; they reverted to the original family name of Barton.

He was also interested in tulips, amaryllis, and other plants. Early life and education William Rickatson Dykes was born on 4 November 1877 at Bayswater in London, the second son of Alfred Dykes.Ray Desmond He was a clever student and a talented athlete who attended City of London School and then Wadham College, Oxford. In 1900, he obtained an M.A. in classics. Later he received Licence-√®s-lettres from the University of Paris (Sorbonne). Between 1903 and 1919, Dykes was a schoolmaster at Charterhouse School in Godalming. He taught Greek and Latin and occasionally football. Botanical work Iris decora ) by F.H. Round for William Rickatson Dykes, The Genus Iris, 1913 (plate 39). While studying at Oxford, Dykes had met Sir Michael Foster, who instilled in him a passion for studying irises. After he moved to Godalming, he created a large garden to grow irises. When Foster died in 1907, Dykes received the loan of a large collection of Foster's notes for a comprehensive study of irises that he had been unable to complete before his death. Dykes took over this study and completed it, a process that formed the basis for his first book, Irises (1909), a volume in the series Present-Day Gardening. A smallish book, it focuses on the decorative uses of the iris as a garden plant but also contains plenty of scientific information. By 1910, Dykes was being interviewed by Garden Life magazine as an expert amateur and recognised authority on iris cultivation. In his own garden, he had developed an extensive collection embracing most known species. He had several bulb frames. In 1911, Dykes travelled to the South of France, in Hy√®res in Var, in search of irises that he had read about, where he discovered Iris spuria var. maritima. It was later published in his 1913 book The Genus Iris. During this period, he also worked with retired engineer and plant breeder Arthur J. Bliss (1862‚Äì1931) to breed several hybrids. Dykes undertook a formal study of the iris genus at the botanical library at Kew Gardens Herbarium. He also examined hundreds of iris species specimens at other collections, including the British Museum, Oxford Botanical Garden, Cambridge Botanic Garden, Edinburgh Botanic Garden, Berlin Botanical Garden, Vienna Hofmuseum and Jardin des plantes. In 1913, he published his second book, The Genus Iris, in which he created the first classification of irises according to Linnaeus's botanical system. In 1924, he was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal in recognition of the importance of this book in the field of horticulture. Although a landmark in its day, it is now considered out-of-date taxonomically. Iris classification was improved by George H.M. Lawrence (in 1953), then by Georgi Rodionenko (in 1961) and Brian Mathew (in 1981). The Genus Iris had 48 full-color plates made from watercolors by F.H. Round and painted from plants in Dykes's own garden. Dykes knew Round because he was an assistant drawing master at Charterhouse. Round later commented that, during iris season, Dykes would show up \\"in his dressing gown\\" at 5 in the morning with an iris in hand, expecting the painting to be made immediately while the bloom was still fresh. He said that the drawings for Dykes \\"were easy and comfortable to do.\\" In April 1913, Dykes took a trip to Dalmatian coast, visiting Sarajevo, Clissa, Mostar and Bosnia. He walked and climbed to collect specimens of irises, which he had heard about from other collectors and sources. In 1914, he published his third book on irises, Handbook of Garden Irises. It contains a large amount of information on iris species. That same year, he was interviewed by Country Life magazine on the subject of iris, discussing such species as Iris xiphiodes (the English iris), Junos, and Iris reticulata. In November 1919, he became a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. The following year, he was appointed to the Secretaryship of the Royal Horticultural Society, a position he devoted himself to until 1925. As a result of this appointment, it became necessary for him to leave Godalming and live nearer to London. He made arrangements for nearly all of his collection of irises to be moved to Percy Murrell's Nursery at Orpington in Kent. He retained only a few rhizomes each of some seedlings, planting them on a small plot of ground at the John Innes Research Station at Merton, Surrey. During this period, he raised several hybrid iris seedlings of which 'Amber' (pale yellow, 1924), 'Moonlight' (yellowish-white) and 'Wedgewood' (medium blue) are the best known. He also carried on correspondence with many botanists and gardeners, including the American Grace Sturtevant. In 1924, Dykes married Elise Katherine (n√©e Kaye), who also made a name for herself as an iris hybridiser and painter. They had their own garden at Sutton Green near Guildford, where he planted over 30,000 tulip bulbs. In 1925, Dykes translated from the French Louis Lorette's book on pruning fruit trees, La Taille Lorette.Louis Lorette That same year, Dykes was killed only a week after receiving the Victoria Medal of Honour from the RHS. On 27 November 1925, his car skidded on a slippery road and he crashed into a truck. The impact ejected him from his vehicle and he was so severely injured that he died a few days later on 1 December. Posthumous honours In June 1926, at a meeting of the British Iris Society, it was resolved to award a medal to the hybridiser of the outstanding iris variety of each year in memory of Mr. Dykes. The Dykes Medal was first presented in 1927 to William Mohr for his 'San Francisco' hybrid. Since then, it has become highly coveted by all iris hybridizers. The British Iris Society now presents separate Dykes Medals in Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. It was previously awarded in France as well beginning in 1928, but it stopped in 1938 due to the outbreak of the Second World War and never started up afterwards. Katherine Dykes carried on her husband's plant breeding work, and in 1926, she named a yellow iris (the first true yellow) 'W. R. Dykes' in his honour. It was sold by Orpington Nurseries and was used by other iris breeders to create new hybrids. In 1930, she produced the iris 'Gudrun' (a white), which went on to win the Dykes Medal in 1931. She died in Raynes Park on 25 May 1933 after a train accident. In June 1926, Marion Cran wrote in the Dykes memorial issue of the Annual of the Iris Society, \\"He was to be seen at all the shows, the small fortnightly shows at Vincent Square and the great summer and autumn shows at Chelsea and Holland Park. His broad, burly frame moved in a leisurely way among the exhibits. He might be smiling just broadly like a merry schoolboy, or cross as Good Friday's bun just as the moment might take him; for he was a man of strong personality who made no attempt to disguise his emotions. Unknown to most people, he suffered from Asperger syndrome. Two posthumous publications by Dyke came out in 1930. Dykes's Notes on Tulip Species included fifty-four colour plates of paintings by Katherine Dykes.Dykes on Irises (edited by G. Dillistone) was a reprint of Dykes's contributions to various journals and periodicals during the last 20 years of his life. In 1932, Otto Stapf from Kew Gardens found a hybrid between Iris chrysographes and Iris delavayi in Dykes's garden and named it Iris dykesii in his honour. The name did not stick as the iris was subsequently reclassified as a synonym of Iris chrysographes (Dykes), which Dykes had originally published in Gardeners Chronicles in 1911. In 1935, Alexei Vedenski named a tulip Tulipa dykesiana in Flora of USSR; this too has since been reclassified, in this case as a synonym of Tulipa kolpakowskiana (Regel).

The pool gained notoriety for briefly controlling more than 51% of bitcoin's compute power in 2014 (notable in that bitcoin was supposedly outside of any party's control). History GHash.IO was founded by the CEX.IO bitcoin exchange. Apart from mining bitcoin, GHash.IO hosted a Multipool for mining altcoins, as well as separate pools for mining Litecoin, Dogecoin, Auroracoin and Darkcoin. Altcoin mining options were available for independent miners, while bitcoin mining could also be done in the cloud by purchasing cloud-based mining power on CEX.io. Traders on CEX.io could buy shares of Ghash.IO mining hardware to operate on the Ghash.IO mining pool. After GHash.IO closed in 2016, CEX.io continued operating as a bitcoin exchange. Ghash.io was owned by CEX.io, which is a cryptocurrency exchange that continues to operate today. 51% attack controversy Due to the popularity of Ghash.IO's mining pool, many people in the bitcoin community were often worried about the possibility of a 51% attack. This kind of attack occurs when a single miner or mining pool is able to mine multiple bitcoin block rewards in a row. This would be a problem for the bitcoin network, because it hypothetically allows the mining pool to double-spend (counterfeit) bitcoins. In July 2014, the GHash.IO mining pool briefly exceeded the 51% threshold, which forced the bitcoin community to discuss the possibility of finding a common solution to this threat. The pool developing the majority caused a prominent bitcoin developer Peter Todd to sell half of his holdings. The news reportedly caused bitcoins price to drop from $633 to $600 at the time. Since it is currently difficult to develop a long-term solution to this problem, the participants agreed to implement some temporary measures. Accordingly, GHash.IO released a voluntary statement, promising that it will not exceed 40% of the overall bitcoin hashrate. Moreover, GHash.IO representatives asked other mining pools to follow their example for the sake of the entire bitcoin community. It also stated that a new committee should be created to act as a watchdog against the 51% problem. This committee would include representatives of the mining pools, bitcoin businesses and other specialists in the field. The 51% discussion received broad coverage in the media, beyond publications which commonly focus on cryptocurrency news: ArsTechnica, Bloomberg View, Vice Motherboard, International Business Times. As of 2015 ghash.io's pool had fallen to less than 2% of the total hashrate.

History The song was adapted from a nineteenth century work Dreaming of Home and Mother by John P. Ordway. On March 11, 1916, tenor Evan Williams recorded the English version for Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, NJ. When Ordway's work was introduced into Japan, musician Kyuukei Inudou () translated it (with a few modifications) into the Japanese version, (lit. \\"Loneliness on a Journey\\"), which was published in 1904. During 1905 and 1910, when Li was studying abroad in Japan, he heard this song by chance, and was moved by its melody. Accordingly, when Li returned to China, he wrote Songbie in 1915 based on Ordway's original work. English Lyric of \\"Dreaming of Home and Mother\\" (Evan Williams version) Dreaming of home, dear old home. Home of childhood and mother- Oft when I wake 'tis sweet to find I've been dreaming of home and mother. Home, dear home, childhood's happy home! When I played with sister and with brother 'Twas the sweetest joy when we did roam Over hill and through dale with mother. Chorus. Dreaming of home, dear old home, Home of my childhood and mother- Oft When I wake 'tis sweet to find I've been dreaming of home and mother. Sleep, balmy sleep, close mine eyes, Keep me still thinking of mother- Hark! It's her voice I seem to hear- Yes, I'm dreaming of home und mother. Angels come soothing me to rest, I can feel their presence as none other, For they sweetly say I shall be blest With bright visions of home and mother.-Chorus. In popular culture In July 2018, SNH48 Group issued a covered version of \\"Songbie\\", which was entitled \\"Á†•Á†∫ÂâçË°å\\". The lyrics were re-written by SNH48 ex-member Wu Yanwen, despite her announcement of departure in January 2018.

Anastas Konstantinov in his studio garden in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Konstantinov finished his preliminary art training at the Secondary Art School in Kazanlak, Bulgaria in 1976 and continued his training at the Veliko Tarnovo University until he graduated in 1982 with a master's degree in fine arts. . While he was there, Anastas' paintings got near neo-expressionism and became conflict-driven due to his disgust with the Bulgarian Communist Party and communism as a whole. One critic from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette remarked that those paintings were \\"violent, nihilistic, ominous, even grotesque.\\" In 1986, one of Konstantinov's exhibitions was shut down by the Bulgarian Communist Party for displaying subversive paintings. He continued to fight communism and to portray the dark reality of the time. Despite threats from the authorities, he responded to his exhibition being shut down by painting the series, \\"The Red Pigs,\\" which was laden with even greater themes of discontent. Prof. Dr. Hans Theodor Flemming asserted at an exhibition of Contemporary Bulgarian Art in Hamburg at that time that Anastas' paintings were \\"apocalyptic\\" and that they took place \\"in surreal areas, in which people and animals appear in sinister alienation and decay, thus setting various iconographic riddles.\\" After the end of the Cold War, Konstantinov's paintings became less conflict-driven and began to focus more on the spiritual. As the art critic Bisera Yosifova reported for a Plovdiv newspaper Plovdivski novini, \\"the angry young man from the eighties has revealed for the first time the sacral spaces of the love mystery. He has realized that a lie cannot be deadened with violence, but only with love.\\" Due to the sale of some large paintings, Anastas was able to begin the construction of his project \\"Gallery Anastas\\" in an old part of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Archeologists supervised the construction in order to preserve the Neolithic, Thracian, Roman, and Medieval remnants of the location. The gallery, called Gallery Anastas, opened in 1999 alongside 90 completed works. In 2011, Michelangelo Celli, an American art collector, visited Anastas' personal gallery in Bulgaria and was \\"blown away\\" and \\"deeply moved\\" by his work. Mr. Celli urged Anastas to travel to the United States to paint and gain publicity. He agreed and stayed with Mr. Celli in Pittsburgh for three months. His visit resulted in the creation of the US Project, an initiative which is \\"committed to promoting awareness for the work of Bulgarian artist Anastas Konstantinov in the United States.\\" In 2013, as part of the US Project, Anastas Konstantinov was selected by the Starry Night Exposure Program to participate in art fairs during 2013 Art Basel and 2014 Frieze New York. In 2013, Christian Noorbergen included Anastas in his Carte Blanche Exhibition at the Galerie Schwab in Beaubourg, France. One unintended result of the US Project was that Anastas' artistic reputation in Bulgaria grew. He was asked to appear on Darik Radio Radio Bulgaria and numerous other media sources reported on his whereabouts. As a result of Anastas' 33 years of professional work he was asked to present over eighty of his paintings and sculptures in Plovdiv, Bulgaria at the City Gallery of Fine Arts in July 2014. This exhibition marked the first time in 25 years the artist presented at a major solo exhibition in Plovdiv.

The \\"gang\\" was named after a restaurant run by Mrs. Lucy Lopez. Some of the future politicians had eaten there in their student days. Poor students were never turned away hungry, but were allowed credit or given food for work. Mama Lucy was an inspiration to the future lawmakers. They were mostly members of the Democratic Party but included Republicans. They enacted reforms related to education, the environment and equal opportunity. After a short period out of power in 1979‚Äì82, their successors continued to control the House until 2000. In 1973 the representatives presented a memorial to Mama Lucy in the House. Background The Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, home of Mama Lucy's restaurant Mrs. Lucy Lopez, known as Mama Lucy to her friends, ran the Plaza Hotel Restaurant and Bar in Las Vegas, New Mexico, for fourteen years with her husband before moving across the street to another restaurant on the Las Vegas Plaza. They rented part of the hotel as a dormitory for New Mexico Highlands University students and sold meal tickets for the restaurant as an alternative to the university cafeteria. Daily lunch and dinner cost $30 a month. Students who were short of money could make a special arrangement in exchange for helping out. A former student recalled, \\"The only things worth eating in the dorm cafeteria were the milk and the bread, the rest of the food was so terrible many of the kids used to get a meal ticket at Mama Lucy's.\\" The restaurant was self-service, and the students were trusted not to take too much. The food was varied, but Mama Lucy's Spanish dishes were the most popular. Lucy Lopez's restaurant on the other side of the Las Vegas Plaza was known for her pies. It was a popular spot for politicians, businessman and local leaders to meet and catch up on the news. Old guestbooks from the restaurant contain the signatures of U.S. Senators Joseph Montoya and Dennis Ch√°vez and of New Mexico governors David Cargo, Tom Bolack, Edwin L. Mechem and Jack M. Campbell. Name Albuquerque is the largest city. Santa Fe to the northeast is the state capital. Las Vegas, New Mexico, is east of Santa Fe. The term \\"Mama Lucy Gang\\" was coined in 1966 by the Albuquerque Journal columnist John McMillion. He wrote a column that described a deal he had seen made in the restaurant between Apolonio Duran of San Miguel County and another candidate, and called them \\"the gang in Mama Lucy's back room\\". The term \\"Mama Lucy Gang\\" stuck as a name for San Miguel County (Las Vegas) politicians, despite protests from Mrs. Lopez and her many friends that she was never involved in politics and had no back room. She closed the restaurant later in 1966, partly due to illness. She claimed the idea that a \\"gang\\" was meeting in her restaurant had driven customers away. Mark Douglas Acuff of The New Mexico Independent has been credited with applying the term \\"Mama Lucy Gang\\" to the group of New Mexican progressive liberal legislators of the 1970s. In 1973 this group of state legislators, some of whom had attended Highlands and learned from Mama Lucy's compassionate example, adopted the name. They had previously been called \\"the Young Turks\\" and \\"The Barefoot Gang.\\" Political activity In 1962 the Supreme Court's \\"one person, one vote\\" decision in Baker v. Carr forced the states to make electoral districts across the country more equally balanced by population. As a result greater numbers of liberal representatives from Hispanic and urban intellectual backgrounds began to be elected in New Mexico. Until 1971 the House was dominated by conservative Democrats, mostly from the south and east of New Mexico, but in 1971 the liberal democrat Walter K. Martinez was elected speaker. For the next eight years the Mama Lucy Gang led by Martinez controlled the house and kept conservative \\"Cowboy Democrats\\" from the ranching areas in the south of the state out of the main committees. David Salman was the majority floor leader during this period. The Mama Lucy Gang was a loose coalition of centrist Democrats and some Republicans. They included Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) liberals and Northern New Mexico representatives. Most of the Mama Lucy Gang never met Mrs. Lopez, including their leader Walter K. Martinez, who was sometimes himself called \\"Mama Lucy\\". Tom Brown Jr., representative for Eddy- Chaves, was known as \\"the bald-headed Mama Lucy.\\" The senators Manny Aragon and Jerry Apodaca were associated with the Mama Lucy Gang. Apodaca would later become governor. The Mama Lucy Gang pushed various progressive measures through the legislature over the next six years. These included changes to school funding and measures to protect the environment and promote equal rights. The \\"Mama Lucies\\" had a fundamental impact on New Mexico politics. Their opponents complained of the group's \\"steamroller tactics.\\" Walter Martinez was called a \\"quiet, soft-spoken and popular leader.\\" Martinez managed to equalize school district funding across the state and to develop New Mexico's severance tax permanent fund. The fund aims to smooth out state revenues which would otherwise fluctuate based on demand for mining products. David Salman sponsored a higher minimum-wage law and bilingual education He also supported various clean energy and environment protection measures. The Cowboy Democrats did well in the 1978 election and demanded a strong presence on the committees. Martinez turned them down. During the opening session of the House on 16 January 1979 thirty Democrats and three rogue Republicans voted for Martinez. In an unusual move, eleven conservative Democrats allied with twenty-six Republicans to elect the conservative Democrat Gene Samberson speaker by thirty seven votes. Samberson appointed nine Democrats to committee positions. Martinez refused to chair the Votes and Elections Committee, effectively giving control of this committee to the Republicans. Five of the Democrats who had backed Martinez refused appointments as vice-chairs of committees. The Mama Lucy Gang was out of power. Successors In the 1982 election the liberal Democrats formed a solid majority of the forty-seven Democrat members. The Martinez candidate Raymond G. Sanchez was elected speaker without opposition from the Cowboys. Sanchez was speaker of the house for sixteen years. The coalition of Hispanics, liberal and moderate Democrats, and a few Republicans controlled the New Mexico legislature until the end of the century. In 2000 Raymond Sanchez failed to be reelected to the house, losing to the newcomer John Sanchez, a Republican. The defeat may have been partly due to voters being confused by the names. Tribute In April 1973 progressive liberal members of the House paid tribute to Mrs. Lucy Lopez. John J. Mershon, representative from Cloudcroft, introduced a memorial honoring Mrs. Lopez. He belonged to the conservative group that was usually opposed to the Mama Lucy Gang, so his introduction was a gesture of unity. Richard Carbajal, representative from Belen, spoke first. He said \\"Mama Lucy is the most generous person I have ever met. She was so good to us and helped most of us make it through college. She has a heart as big as she is.\\" He said \\"If she went bankrupt it was because of the big heart she had. Students like me, broke, could go to Mama Lucy and want to charge a meal. She never once flinched. You never walked away hungry if you knew Mama Lucy.\\" Mama Lucy had given Bobby Duran, representative from Taos, a job in her restaurant when he was at Highlands. He said, \\"You gave me a job when I needed it the most. I never could have made it without you.\\" Lucy Lopez died on 31 May 1994 at the age of 80. The impact of the Mama Lucy Gang on state politics in the 1970s is still remembered.

He did extensive research on the physical and psychological effects of various drugs on humans (imprisoned narcotics offenders, see below). Early work investigated aspects of physical dependence (an important aspect of drug addiction) with opiates and barbiturates, while later work (at least partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency as part of the MKUltra project)Marks JD. 1991.

Harry N. Abrams. investigated psychedelic drugs, including LSD. The research was extensively reported in academic journals such as the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Psychopharmacologia, and the AMA Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry. Biography He was born on June 7, 1910 in Arkansas to Francis Taylor Isbell and Celeste Mathews. He received his M.D. from Tulane University School of Medicine in 1934, and held various research positions before becoming head of the Addiction Research Center (ARC) in 1945. He was awarded the US Public Health Service Meritorious Service Award in 1962; Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy praised him as \\"an extraordinarily able director and coordinator of multidisciplinary research\\" and \\"an outstanding investigator in his own right whose work in clinical pharmacology has exerted far-reaching influences on medical practice\\". After leaving the ARC in 1963, he became Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine. Isbell and his associates (including Abraham Wikler) published extensively on the effects of drugs (including opiates, synthetic opioids, barbiturates, alcohol, amphetamine, ibogaine, multiple psychedelics, and THC) on human subjects, with over 125 publications. Among their experimental results were the qualitative and quantitative documentation of physical dependence on barbiturates, physical dependence on alcohol, tolerance to amphetamine, the clinical use of opiate antagonists (e.g., nalorphine/Nalline and naloxone/Narcan) as treatment for opiate overdoses,Jasinski DR. Clinical Aspects of Opiate Antagonists and Partial Agonists. pp 118-124 in Martin and Isbell(1978). the ability of methadone to alleviate opiate withdrawal symptoms, rapid tolerance but lack of physical dependence with LSD, cross-tolerance between LSD and psilocybin, and the ability of pure THC to cause marijuana-like effects. New pharmaceutical substances were assayed (in the prisoner population) for their abuse and addiction (substance dependence) potential (medications for pain, cough, and diarrhea were of particular concern),Fraser, HF. Methods for Evaluating the Overall Abuse Liability of Weak Opiate-like Drugs. pp 42-62 in Martin and Isbell(1978). and this information was utilized by groups such as the World Health Organization.Campbell ND. 2007. Discovering Addiction: The Science and Politics of Substance Abuse Research. University of Michigan Press. Other work at the ARC during Isbell's tenure included psychological aspects of human opiate addiction (e.g., re-arousal of craving after abstinence upon return to the addiction environment, i.e. a \\"conditioned\\" response),Wikler A. Neurophysiological and Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Opioid Dependence. pp 63-88 in Martin and Isbell(1978). EEG studies of mental activity during drug use (including mescaline),Kay DC. Electroencephalographic and Sleep Studies of Psychoactive Drugs . pp 140-151 in Martin and Isbell(1978). and animal studies. (A detailed annotated bibliography of ARC research was published in 1978). Isbell died on December 23, 1994 in Lexington, Kentucky. Research Areas of interest described in Isbell's published work include physical and psychological effects of individual substances (including potential for dependence and addiction), ways to mitigate withdrawal symptoms (e.g., methadone therapy), the development of reliable rating methods and questionnaires for subjective drug effects (the Addiction Research Center Inventory),Haertzen, CA. Clinical Psychological Studies. pp 155-168 in Martin and Isbell(1978).Isbell, Belleville, Haertzen, Jasinski, Martin. Round Table Discussion: Measurement of Subjective Responses to Psychoactive Drugs and Personality Characteristics of Narcotic Addicts. pp 200-204 in Martin and Isbell(1978). cross-drug comparisons, drug tolerance, and classification of drug groups (based on both the physiological and the subjective effects of a drug, as well as its cross-tolerance with other drugs). =\\"Volunteer\\" subjects= The subjects in Isbell's experiments are described as \\"volunteers\\"; they were recruited from the associated Lexington Public Health Service Hospital. The hospital was a US Government facility for treating drug abuse; some patients were sentenced drug offenders, while others voluntarily entered for treatment. The subjects in ARC experiments were all incarcerated male narcotics offenders with a history of drug addiction; subjects signed a simple \\"Consent Form\\". Subjects were motivated by payment in the form of drugs (usually opiates); this fact is not documented in the published research articles. The separate living environment within the ARC for experimental subjects (e.g., the possibility of having a small private room) was also a motivation. The use of prison subjects for these sorts of experiments (and the nature of payment) would be difficult or impossible to justify by current human subjects and informed consent standards. The potential for coercion in a prison environment is one concern; providing drugs (whether as experimental substances or as payment) to abstinent addicts in a treatment center is another. (See Campbell (2007) for a detailed discussion of ethical and historical aspects of the ARC subject protocols). Subjects in the experiments are described as physically healthy former drug addicts who were not psychotic, although they often were described as having \\"character disorders or inadequate personalities\\" (this diagnosis appears to be based on MMPI test evaluation). Subjects in some of the more extreme psychedelic experiments (LSD doses for 77 days in a row) were all \\"Negro males\\", though this is not a regular pattern (e.g., the 5 subjects in the similarly extreme 1950 barbiturate study described below were all white males). In spite of the risky nature of some of the experiments (e.g., inducing addiction to opiates, alcohol, barbiturates, or new minimally tested pharmaceuticals, and then forcing immediate and severe withdrawal), there were apparently no fatalities, though there was at least one close call. Subjects sometimes dropped out in the middle of an experiment, although in one reported case a subject who wished to drop out after a severe negative reaction to a 180 microgram LSD dose (\\"He felt that he would die or would become permanently insane\\") required \\"considerable persuasion\\" to continue. =General methodology= The studies took place in a dedicated experimental ward. Given the hospital context, medical personnel were readily available. In general, the methodology appears scientifically sound (e.g., proper balancing of experimental conditions, within-subjects designs, single (sometimes double) blind procedures as appropriate, placebo conditions, careful documentation of the experimental procedures, appropriate awareness of potential confounding factors, etc.), although the small number of subjects in some of the experiments is a statistical concern. The general methodology for the addiction studies consisted of first getting subjects drug-free (with apparent exceptions for cigarettes and coffee), and then attempting to induce addiction by regular administration (orally or injected) of the substance of interest. Addiction was determined by the occurrence of abstinence symptoms when administration of the substance stopped. Sometimes a different substance (e.g., methadone) would be administered at the peak of withdrawal to determine if it alleviated symptoms. Following the evaluation of this cold turkey withdrawal, subjects were then usually more gradually weaned off of the substance being tested. Isbell also evaluated the \\"euphoric\\" effect of various drugs (typically opioids), evaluating various doses to see if they induced similar effects (e.g., talkativeness, comfort in the experimental situation, sedation in high doses) as 30 mg of morphine. cited in, The ability to induce euphoria is sometimes/often considered to be a component of addiction liability. In the psychedelic studies, subjects had the choice of staying in an individual room or mingling with other subjects in a common area. Observations and measurements were taken before the substance of interest was ingested, and hourly thereafter (following a 10-minute rest in bed). Physical measurements included pulse, blood pressure, rectal temperature, kneejerk reflex sensitivity, and pupil diameter (opiates cause constriction (miosis) while LSD causes dilation (mydriasis)). Psychological measurements consisted of a self- evaluation form with multiple statements (e.g., \\"I am confused\\"), as well as evaluation by experienced and trained observers. Some subjects had negative reactions to LSD (as noted above), but others found the experience \\"pleasant\\", or even \\"dearly loved\\" it as long as the dosage was not too high (less than 2 micrograms per kilogram of body weight).Isbell, H. Clinical Research 1944-1963. pp 27-41 in Martin and Isbell(1978). =Opioids= Isbell and associates published a number of studies on morphine, methadone and assorted analgesics; much of this work was motivated by the search for a \\"nonaddicting analgesic\\" (that is, a compound with the pain-relieving capabilities of morphine, but without the opioid dependence issues). Many opiate derivatives and synthetic opioids were tested for addiction and abuse potential. Isbell and Vogel (1949) investigated methadone, a synthetic opioid developed in Germany in 1937. They found that intravenous methadone had similar subjective effects as morphine and heroin, and induced physical dependence with chronic use. However, the withdrawal symptoms were significantly milder than with morphine. Administration of methadone during morphine withdrawal alleviated withdrawal symptoms, and methadone was reasonably effective when taken orally. This combination of characteristics led them to propose methadone administration as a way of facilitating morphine withdrawal. =Barbiturates= Isbell et al. (1950) did a controlled experiment (no other drugs involved, and proper nutrition) on the effects of chronic barbiturate administration. 5 non-epileptic subjects were given slowly increasing doses of secobarbital, pentobarbital, or amobarbital to a point of obvious intoxication over a period of more than 73 days. Both the nature of the intoxication and the nature of the withdrawal symptoms are described as similar to chronic alcohol use. Intoxication symptoms included confusion, poor judgment, hostility, and motor incoordination. Upon abrupt withdrawal of barbiturates, initial symptoms included tremor, anxiety, weakness, and vomiting, followed by convulsion, delirium, and hallucinations. =Alcohol= Isbell et al. (1955) demonstrated that alcohol causes physical dependence; that is, cessation of alcohol consumption in a chronic user can cause significant physical withdrawal symptoms. Subjects were abstinent drug addicts; some but not all had a history of heavy alcohol use. Out of 10 initial subjects, 6 subjects were successfully kept in a state of constant moderate intoxication (still able to walk) for a period from 48‚Äì87 days. Subjects were given controlled oral doses of alcohol throughout the day from 6am until midnight, and a booster dose around 3am; the total consumption per subject was in the range of a quart of 80-proof liquor per day. All subjects were provided with a healthy diet in addition to the alcohol. Withdrawal of alcohol at the end of the intoxication period produced tremors and weakness in all 6 subjects. Two subjects suffered convulsions, and delirium or hallucinations (audio or visual) occurred in 4 of the 6 subjects. Given these withdrawal symptoms, Isbell et al. (1955) make some proposals for safely managing alcohol withdrawal. =Psychedelics= Starting in 1956, Isbell and associates published studies on LSD, psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, bufotenine, morning glory seeds (ololiuqui), and mescaline; these substances were sometimes described as \\"psychotomimetic\\". LSD and psilocybin for many of the experiments was supplied by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (both of these substances were legal at the time). According to a 1986 interview with Isbell, the psychedelics research was initiated by an explicit CIA request. LSD * Isbell et al. (1956) motivated their study of LSD by the superficial similarities between the LSD state (viewed as a temporary \\"reversible psychosis\\") and schizophrenia, as well as the previous findings of interactions between LSD and the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin. A dosage of 1-2 micrograms per kilogram of body weight was determined to induce \\"striking effects\\" (mood change, perceptual distortion, pupil dilation). Four experiments then quantified tolerance effects (the extent to which repeated doses of LSD cause a reduction in the effect of a subsequent dose). Experiment 4 included 77 consecutive days with doses of 1.55 micrograms/kg (corresponding to a dose of 140 micrograms for someone weighing 200 pounds), although the full sequence of LSD doses was at least a week or two longer than this due to the tolerance protocol. Tolerance to LSD developed rapidly; by day 3 the subjective effects were significantly lessened, and later in the experiments subjects simply read and watched TV normally. In the middle of the experiment, even a quadruple dose (600 micrograms or so) had little effect. Tolerance also disappeared rapidly; after no LSD had been given for 3 days, a subsequent dose again had a large effect. There were no abstinence symptoms after LSD administration stopped (i.e., no physical dependence). * Isbell et al. (1956) also concluded that the LSD reaction \\"had only a superficial resemblance to the chronic forms of any of the major psychoses\\". * Isbell and Logan (1957) reported that chlorpromazine (Thorazine) could either block or reverse the effects of LSD. Azacyclonol had no effect, while pre-treatment with reserpine augmented the effects of LSD (though in a manner described as \\"unpleasant\\"). Isbell et al. (1959b) reported that pre-treatment with scopolamine (an acetylcholine antagonist), phenoxybenzamine (an adrenergic alpha blocker) or \\"BAS\\" (a 5-methoxytryptamine based serotonin antagonist) had little effect on a subsequent LSD dose. They attempt to explain these results within the neurotransmitter (\\"neurohumors\\") knowledge of the period. Psilocybin * Isbell (1959) reported that psilocybin had physical and psychological effects similar to LSD, although psilocybin had a shorter duration and much less potency for a given dosage. * Isbell et al. (1961) found that 12 days treatment with LSD induced tolerance to either LSD or psilocybin (lessened response on pupil dilation and the psychological measures), and that psilocybin also induced tolerance to both LSD and psilocybin. This cross-tolerance supported the hypothesis that the two substances at least partially share their mechanism of action. Other * Wolbach et al. (1962) reported that mescaline and LSD had similar effects (although with different time course and potency), that direct tolerance could be induced by mescaline, and that each substance induced cross-tolerance to the other. This was particularly interesting, since LSD (and psilocybin) are indole compounds, while mescaline is not. * Contrasting with the psilocybin and mescaline results, Isbell et al. (1964) found that tolerance to intramuscular LSD did not provide tolerance to an intramuscular injection of the indole hallucinogen DMT. * Isbell et al. (1959c) investigated the psychological and physical effects of 13 different congeners of LSD, and correlated these effects with their potency as a serotonin antagonist in smooth muscle. With the exception of \\"ALD-52\\", all of the substances were less potent than LSD. There was low correlation between the smooth muscle and the \\"psychotomimetic\\" effects. =THC (marijuana)= Starting in 1967, Isbell and associates published a few studies on THC and marijuana (cannabis). * Isbell et al. (1967) reported that pure THC (which had only recently been chemically isolated with its chemical structure identified) had marijuana-like effects (e.g., increased pulse rate (tachycardia) and altered time sense), whether smoked or taken orally. A number of other isolated compounds present in marijuana (cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene) did not show these effects. * Isbell and Jasinski (1969) compared LSD (1.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, injected intramuscularly) and smoked THC (225 or 250 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, added to a tobacco cigarette). Physical symptoms were quite different (e.g., tachycardia with THC, dilated pupils with LSD), and tolerance to LSD did not cause tolerance to THC, suggesting different mechanisms of action. Their data do not show a statistical difference in the psychological effects of the two substances; this is somewhat surprising since cannabis is not usually considered to be a psychedelic drug. Whether this result is due to the small number of subjects, an inappropriate rating scale, the use of pure THC, or an exceedingly high THC dose (they report that some subjects had \\"hallucinations\\", and two subjects withdrew after experiencing \\"psychotic reactions\\" to THC) is unclear. * Jasinski, Haertzen, and Isbell (1971) describe some of the subjective and physiological effects of the synthetic cannabinoids parahexyl and dimethylheptylpyran. Isbell also investigated dosage effects of THC, and reported that low doses (4‚Äì6 mg) produced a pleasurable state (euphoria, perceptual distortion, and change of mood); this dosage was described by subjects as \\"good reefer\\". However, higher doses (18 milligrams of THC) reliably produced what Isbell referred to as a \\"psychotic reaction\\" (e.g., \\"all of a sudden [the subject] was on a trip and watching his own burial. The smoker will swear that what hit him never came from marijuana\\"). Isbell also commented on the potency of street marijuana of that time (\\"the local grass is probably pretty weak stuff\\"). Drug policy In 1951 Isbell testified to Congress before the passage of the Boggs Act of 1952 that \\"smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects, no dependence is developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at any time.\\" Isbell (1971b) (p 903) provides a liberal view of drug policy. He observes that the drug laws of the time are \\"excessively rigid and extremely punitive\\", and have not had any proven effect on the drug problem. He then states that \\"simple possession of a drug for one's own use should be a civil offense punishable only by a fine\\", and suggests the possibility that marijuana of low or moderate potency could be legalized and regulated like tobacco, while also observing that maintenance on barbiturates, cocaine, or amphetamine would not be \\"pharmacologically sound\\". However, Isbell rejected removing controls on marijuana, which would \\"open the way to more potent stuff\\" such as hashish, with the consequent risk of high-dose effects.

Produced by Bhardwaj and Vineet Jain, the film is based on the 2008 Noida double murder case involving a teenage girl and her family's servant. Starring Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma and Neeraj Kabi, the film follows the investigation of a case from three different perspectives in which her parents are either guilty or innocent of the murder charges by the police investigation, the first Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe and an investigation by a different CBI team. It was conceived by Bhardwaj after he met some of the police officials who were investigating the case. He later met Meghna, and expressed his desire to produce a film with her; they then came up with the idea of making a film about the real-life case. They researched the case for two years and found several contradictions, with each view having some validity. Bhardwaj's script was an example of the Rashomon effect. Pankaj Kumar was the film's director of photography, and A. Sreekar Prasad was its editor. Talvar premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival in the special-presentation section, and was screened at the 2015 BFI London Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in India on 2 October 2015 to mostly-positive reviews, with particular praise for its writing and performances; however, many of the critics felt that the film was very biased towards the parents. The film was a moderate box-office success, grossing . Bhardwaj received the Best Adapted Screenplay Award for Talvar at the 63rd National Film Awards, and Prasad received the Award for Best Editing at the 61st Filmfare Awards.  Plot  Fourteen-year-old Shruti Tandon is found dead at her home in Sameer Vihar in Noida by her parents, Ramesh and Nutan, during the night of 15‚Äì16 March 2008. The local police force, led by Inspector Dhaniram, are incompetent and do not know the basics of criminal investigation. They initially look for Khempal, the missing servant; his decomposed body is later found on the terrace of the building where the Tandons live. The police question Kanhaiya, Khempal's close friend and the Tandons' assistant, who tells them that Ramesh might have been involved in an extra-marital affair and Khempal might have been involved in a relationship with Shruti. They begin to suspect the Tandons, and declare the murders a clear case of honour killing. On 25 March, the Noida police arrest Ramesh for the murders. The police chief organises a press conference, at which he says that Ramesh murdered Shruti and Khempal after he found them in a compromising position. The victim blaming of Shruti leads to public outrage, and the case is given to Joint Director Ashwin Kumar of the Central Department of Investigation (CDI) and ACP Vedant. Kumar is contemptuous of the sloppy first responders, who botched the initial crime-scene investigation. He believes that the parents are innocent, and methodically builds a case against the father's resentful assistant. His team uses narco tests in their attempt to prove that the assistant (and two accomplices) committed the murders. Kumar exonerates the parents on 22 June 2008, and Ramesh is released from jail. As Kumar is about to conclude his investigation, his senior officer retires and is replaced by a new CDI chief. ACP Vedant, eager to receive a promotion, begins working against Kumar. This leads to an altercation between the two officers, which results in Kumar's suspension. The CDI gives the case to a new investigative team led by Kumar's former superior, Paul, who concludes that the parents committed the murders. Both investigative teams, with opposing hypotheses, make their cases to the CDI chief. The CDI files a closure report in the Ghaziabad court naming the parents as prime suspects, but the evidence is insufficient to prosecute. The Tandons file a protest plea against the CDI report. The judge rejects the closure report, and accuses the parents in the case. The trial begins on 8 June 2012, and the Tandons are convicted of the murders several months later.

Meghna said that she was \\"beginning to wonder what to do next\\" when she had the conversation with Bhardwaj, and they came up with the idea of making a film about the 2008 Noida double murder case. Bhardwaj and Meghna researched the case for nearly two years and found \\"several bizarre contradictions and each view had their own conviction\\". They decided to present three perspectives in the story: the police investigation, the first CBI probe and an investigation by a different CBI team. Bhardwaj and Meghna did not yet obtain permission from the Talwar family for the film. Meghna was fascinated by the idea of exploring the \\"unfinished-ness\\" of the case. In January 2015, it was announced that the Talwar couple (who were in prison) had approved the film. Bhardwaj, who wrote and produced the film, said that he was influenced by the Rashomon effect (in which the same event is given different interpretations by the individuals involved). According to Meghna, she tried to keep the narrative as objective as possible to let the viewer interpret it on their own. The names of individuals and organisations were changed in the film to avoid legal issues. At a screening, lawyer and politician Ram Jethmalani, said that the trial depicted in the film was inaccurate. Meghna responded, \\"[The film] is more about the investigation than about the trial. In fact, the trial is not part of the film at all. It tracks the many investigations.\\" The first draft of the screenplay was written in a year, and it took more time to convince those involved in the investigation to participate. Aarushi's aunt, Vandana Talwar (who began a campaign to prove the parents' innocence), provided some material to Bhardwaj. Some of the documents provided to Bhardwaj were firsthand accounts by Rajesh and Nupur Talwar. Earlier entitled Nyodda, the film was renamed Talvar. The title was initially registered with Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC), but was purchased by Bhardwaj. PNC was the film's initial co-producer, but the company withdrew from the project. About the film's title, Meghna said that it referred to justice: \\"Talvar alludes to the sword that is held in the hand of the lady of justice.\\" She also said that the film would serve its purpose if it begins a debate about re-examining the case. Bhardwaj was driven to write the script after an encounter with the case's first investigating officer: \\"There was a kind of black humour that was coming out of this tragedy. I am a great fan of Rashomon. I found the best way to write the script in it\\". He was troubled by the fact that people talked about Aarushi's death, but paid little attention to her parents. Meghna and Bhardwaj began researching the case in mid-2012, during the trial. Bhardwaj said that although he took \\"some liberties with the script\\", he did not meddle with the story. About the film's purpose, Meghna said that a number of people \\"knew something about the case, but they didn't know everything about it or remember it\\". She said that the film brings out the different aspects of the case. Research continued while the film was being shot because of changes on the set or in a scene. Meghna obtained the Talwars' side of the story from a meeting with Rajesh Talwar's brother and sister-in-law, Dinesh Talwar and his wife Vandana; afterwards, she said that she \\"did not feel the need to meet the Talwars\\". = Casting and filming = Alisha Parvin played Shruti Tandon, a role based on Arushi Talwar. Konkona Sen Sharma was approached by Talvar casting director, who told her about a role based on Nupur Talwar which attracted her. She said she enjoyed the script, and agreed to do the film after meeting Meghna. Sharma did not research her role (she felt that the script was \\"well researched\\"), and said that her character was about \\"portraying guilt and innocence according to perceptions.\\" In November 2013, it was announced that Irrfan Khan was cast in the film. Khan did not know about the case in detail before the film. His character was based on CBI officer Arun Kumar, whom he met in preparation for the film, and he was the only actor approached to play the role. Khan agreed to do the film because he considered the story \\"near and frightening\\", and the film was not sensationalised: \\"It is an important case, and whatever you may think about the verdict, the film gives us a chance to look at our system and how different departments deal with a crisis.\\" Neeraj Kabi, who played Aarushi's father (Rajesh Talwar) in the film, said: \\"You are making a film about people who are alive and are suffering, you have to be extremely sensitive\\". Tabu made a three-minute appearance in the film as Khan's wife. Principal photography began a year later (in June 2014) on location in Mumbai, Delhi and Noida, and lasted almost a year. According to Meghna, filming was a \\"hugely draining\\" experience. The script was based on material in the public domain, and she called it her \\"most fragile film\\". Several scenes were filmed in a house identical to the Talwars', a few blocks away. Meghna said that the most difficult part for her was filming the murder scenes; although there were different weapons and different killers from different perspectives, the \\"one[s] to die w[ere] always the girl and the man, which did not change\\". Pankaj Kumar was Talvar director of photography, and A. Sreekar Prasad edited the film.  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by Vishal Bhardwaj, with lyrics by Gulzar. The album consisted of four songs, with vocals by Arooj Aftab, Rekha Bhardwaj, Sukhwinder Singh and Arijit Singh. It was released on 16 September 2015 on the T-Series label. The score was composed by Ketan Sodha. The album received generally-positive reviews. Mohar Basu of The Times of India wrote, \\"With Gulzar saab's work at the pen joining Vishal's formidable sense of melody, Talvar's album [has] a heady quality\\". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama said that the film \\"has a situational soundtrack which has a couple of heartfelt numbers connecting one to the film's theme\\", praising \\"Insaaf\\" for its \\"uniqueness quotient\\" and the \\"haunting appeal\\". Ruchi Kaushal wrote that \\"Zinda Hai\\" \\"painfully highlights the agony of the parents who have lost their daughter in a twin murder case, for which they themselves are accused.\\"  Release  Talvar premiered under the title Gulity at 2015 Toronto International Film Festival's special presentation on 14 September 2015, and was screened at the 2015 BFI London Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival. The film's trailer was released on 22 August 2015, followed by two posters featuring Lady Justice and Khan. The film was released on 625 screens throughout India on 2 October 2015. Paid previews were organized a day before its public release. A special screening for celebrities was presented several days after its release. Talvar, the second 2015 film based on the case (the first was Rahasya), was released on DVD on 24 November 2015 and is also available on Netflix.  Reception  Talvar received a positive critical reception. Rajyasree Sen of Firstpost called the film a \\"must see whodunnit\\" with a \\"gritty documentary feel\\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV praised its writing and performances, calling it a \\"gripping, genre-defying and non-exploitative cinematic examination\\" of the murder case. Srijana Mitra Das of The Times of India wrote, \\" ... Talvar is super-sharp, a sword swipe at Bollywood's song-and-dance, mehendi-fuelled escapism.\\" Rajeev Masand called the film a \\"gripping, then baffling, and ultimately disturbing account\\" of the murder, \\"deliberately unsentimental and melodrama-free\\". Sneha May Francis of Emirates 24/7 praised Sharma and Kabi, expressing that they \\"play the parents impressively, with restrained perfection\\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters noted that it is a \\"well- constructed, gripping film\\", but the filmmakers' bias about the case left a \\"bitter aftertaste\\". Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in felt the film was a \\"slickly produced, tightly written and beautifully performed true crime documentary\\"; she also called Talvar a \\"legal petition disguised as a movie\\", whose sole purpose was to request the authorities to reconsider the case. Aseem Chhabra of Rediff.com observed: \\"very uncomfortable film to watch\\": \\"A good film should be able to get into our skin, challenge us, shake us up and Talvar does all of that.\\" Jai Arjun Singh praising Khan's performance, said that his character's \\"commitment and comic timing\\" were rare in Hindi films. Namrata Joshi of Outlook described its \\"solid writing, sharp dialogue and the spot-on performances\\" as the strengths. She praised its humour in the face of a serious investigation, which gave the film a \\"nice touch\\". Sarit Ray of Hindustan Times mentioned Talvar \\"shakes you up and forces you to think\\". He praised the \\"believable and flawed\\" character of Ashwini, who \\"drinks on the sly, out of bottles wrapped in paper bags, and distractedly plays Snakes on his phone while a parent sobs\\" instead of being a \\"punchline-spewing hero figure\\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express thought that it was \\"a brave film that devastates, and despite its flaws, makes for a compelling watch.\\" Raja Sen wrote in his review: \\"A tightly-coiled procedural made with such dryness that it seems, in parts, documentarian ‚Äì resembling a reenactment more than a feature film\\". Deepanjana Pal said that Talvar was more of a \\"much-needed social document than a film\\", and its \\"direction lacks imagination\\". Anuj Kumar of The Hindu reviewed, \\"Its intentions might be blunt but as a piece of cinema Talvar is a sharp procedural.\\" Uday Bhatia of Mint praised its performances and Bhardwaj's screenplay: \\"A taut film on the Noida double homicide, built around an exceptional screenplay\\". According to Sonia Chopra of Sify, the film was a \\"perfect balance of sobriety and cruelly dark humour.\\" Among overseas reviewers, Joe Leydon of Variety labelled the screenplay \\"solidly constructed\\" and the film's narrative flow \\"satisfyingly brisk\\". J. Hurtado of Screen Anarchy wrote, \\"Talvar makes for gripping, infuriating, and at times illuminating viewing, and it's a film that will translate just as well to those ignorant with the case as to those intimately involved.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, naming it \\"gripping from start to finish.\\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times noted Khan's performance as the \\"movie's best weapon\\": \\"Playing a familiar character type, the world-weary detective, he gives a performance, full of small, sly details, that doesn't seem familiar at all.\\" = Box office = Talvar was filmed on a budget of . Released with Singh Is Bliing and Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon, the film grossed at the box office and earned from the paid preview before its theatrical release.

His father Lal Pratap Singh, was a revolutionary who was killed in 1857 in the Battle of Chanda.  Publication of Hindosthan  The Hindusthan was started by Raja Rampal Singh of Kalakankar, situated on the banks of the Ganga, about 15 miles from Allahabad. The Ganga surrounds Kalakankar on three sides. All the houses in Kalakankar, except Raja Rampal Singh's own palace or the so- called 'fort', were made of mud and their roofs of burnt clay tiles. Even though, from the point of view of communications, this place was hardly suitable for publishing a newspaper, the Raja was fond of it and had it connected telegraphically.

Leonard took over as president and CEO of the company in 1991. Early life and education Stew Leonard Jr. comes from a long line of family members in the dairy business. His grandfather, Charles Leo Leonard, founded Clover Farms Dairy in Norwalk, Connecticut in the 1920s. The elder Leonard and his sons would deliver milk door-to-door straight from the farm. When Charles Leonard died, the business passed to Stew Leonard Sr., who wanted to move beyond being a milkman. Stew Leonard Sr. would then open the original Stew Leonard's dairy store in Norwalk in 1969. Stew Leonard Jr. often worked in that original dairy store as a child, washing out milk cans, loading egg shelves, and performing other basic tasks. Leonard later attended Ithaca College, earning a Bachelor of Science in Accounting in 1977. He continued his education at UCLA's prestigious Anderson School of Management, where he earned a Master of Business Administration in 1982. Career as CEO Stew Leonard Jr. first took over the helm of Stew Leonard's in 1991, after his father Stew Leonard Sr. was charged with a $17 million tax fraud by the IRS. At the time, there was some major concern about Stew Leonard Jr.'s ability to continue the success that the chain had experienced under his father. The first few years were turbulent under Stew Leonard Jr., but he quickly turned it around. The store in Norwalk was earning less than $100 million in 1991, but, by 2002, Leonard had helped increase sales to $300 million with 3 stores. Leonard attributes the success of the company to its emphasis on customer service and employee care. Under Stew Leonard Jr., the grocery store chain has also been recognized as one of the best places to work in the nation. 82% of all managers are promoted from within, and Stew Leonard's frequently applies positive reinforcement to boost employee morale. In 1999, Stew Leonard spearheaded the opening of a store in Yonkers, New York. The store continued the \\"Disneyesque\\" theme, but it also housed the first Stew Leonard's Wines store. By 2014, Leonard had helped grow the business to 4 grocery stores. Additionally, there are 9 wine stores across Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, each of which is independently owned and operated by family members. The food and wine stores cumulatively employ 2,000 people and approach $400 million in sales per year. This is despite the fact that the company (proudly) offers only 2,000 items, a large majority of which is perishable and prepared food. The success of these business principles has gained Stew Leonard Jr. a significant degree of respect in the retail industry. Stew Leonard's Wines was also recognized by Wine Enthusiast Magazine as the Retailer of the Year in 2011 and 2013. Leonard is a prominent public speaker and is featured as one of the top orators at the prestigious Washington Speakers Bureau. Philanthropy Leonard and his wife, Kim, founded the Stew Leonard III Children's Charities, which offers swimming lessons to thousands of underprivileged youths each year. They have also released a series of children's books about water safety that feature the character, Stewie the Duck. In 2012, they released an app version of the children's book with Stewie the Duck at the forefront.

He previously founded in 2002 Medtech S.A; specializing in the design, development and marketing of surgical assistance robots that was sold to Zimmer Biomet in 2016.  Biography  Bertin Nahum attended the National Institute of Applied Sciences in Lyon (France) where he achieved an Engineering Degree. He then went on to study a Masters in Robotics at Coventry University (UK). Following different experiences in the medical engineering field and having collaborated with well-known surgeons, Bertin Nahum decided to devote his career to creating medical technology solutions to enhance surgical interventions, including creating the latest generation of robotic assistance to use during operations. In 2002, after winning the national innovative start-up companies contest organized by the French Ministry of Higher education and Research, Bertin Nahum founded Medtech S.A. Medtech S.A. Set up in Montpellier in 2002, the company began to work on minimally-invasive knee surgery and developed its very first robot which they named BRIGIT‚Ñ¢. BRIGIT‚Ñ¢ was designed to assist surgeons in minimally-invasive placement of knee prostheses. In 2006, the entire patent portfolio protecting BRIGIT‚Ñ¢ was acquired by Zimmer Inc., a leader in orthopedic surgery. Medtech S.A reinvested the proceeds of this deal in a new research program which led to the creation of its next robot; ROSA‚Ñ¢. This technology has been used successfully with patients suffering from a variety of diseases including Parkinson‚Äôs, hydrocephalus and drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. Using robotic arms, ROSA‚Ñ¢ makes interventions more efficient and less invasive. To this day, thousands of patients across Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East benefited from brain and spine interventions carried out with ROSA‚Ñ¢. In 2013, the company launched a successful initial public offering (IPO), raising EUR 20M on Euronext in Paris. In July 2016, Medtech S.A was acquired by the Zimmer Biomet Group (NYSE: ZBH) for EUR 164M. Bertin Nahum maintained his leadership role and directed Zimmer‚Äôs robotic development activities at Medtech S.A company‚Äôs current headquarters in Montpellier until January 2017. Quantum Surgical In February 2017, Bertin Nahum, together with three of his former associates founded Quantum Surgical. Based in Montpellier, the company continues to explore the potential of minimally-invasive surgical robotics, now focusing on cancer treatment, particularly liver cancer. In June 2018, Quantum Surgical raised $10M in a Series A funding round led by Ally Bridge Group. In April 2019, Quantum Surgical, Ally Bridge and LifeTech Scientific announce three-way China joint venture to develop innovative surgical robot for the treatment of liver cancer. With 8,000 new cases every year in France, and 800, 000 around the world, liver cancer is the 6th most common cancer in the world.  Distinctions  In September 2012 Bertin Nahum was ranked 4th amongst the top 10 most revolutionary High-Tech Entrepreneurs by the Canadian magazine Discovery Series just behind Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and James Cameron. One year later, in September 2013, Bertin Nahum was conferred one of the highest French civilian distinction; the prestigious award of Knight of the Legion of Honor which he received from Fleur Pellerin then Minister of innovation and the Digital Economy. In November 2014, Bertin Nahum received the title of Doctor of Technology, honoris causa, from Coventry University (UK) in recognition of his revolutionary contribution to the medical profession by improving surgical procedures using robotic medical technology.

Warsaw University of Technology, April 1971, after talks with Chancellor ≈Åubi≈Ñski. Jan J√≥zef Wiƒôckowski nom de guerre Drogos≈Çaw (July 25, 1923, in Warsaw, Poland ‚Äì July 11, 2008, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, US) was a Sub-Scout Master in the Polish Scouting Movement, a 2nd Lieutenant of the Home Army and a Captain of the Polish Armed Forces, Polish resistance member during the Warsaw Uprising, both Chief and Chief of Security for the Second Company Rudy of Battalion Zo≈õka, and a 1951 graduate of international economics from Stetson University. Youth Jan Wiƒôckowski, born Jan J√≥zef Wiƒôckowski, was the son of Aleksander Wiƒôckowski ‚Äì a veteran of the Polish- Soviet War and an architect engineer who worked in the Infrastructure Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Interwar Poland, and Dr. Helena Wiƒôckowska n√©e Braunstein ‚Äì a veteran of the Siege of Lw√≥w, doctor of philosophy from the University of Warsaw, historian and director of the university library in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Jan was the brother of Maria Wiƒôckowska, a courier for the First Platoon \\"Sad\\" of the Battalion \\"Zo≈õka\\" murdered during the Warsaw Uprising. Jan was a student of the Male Gymnasium & Lyceum of the Masovian Lands Society. One of his classmates was Andrzej Romocki. From 1935, Jan was a scout in the 21st Varsovian Scout Team Ignacy PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski. Resistance =1940‚Äì1944= Jan Wiƒôckowski joined PET in 1940. PET was a small organization created by Polish students which allowed young Poles to continue their education in the Polish Underground. Through PET, Jan completed his schooling and passed his Matura examination in 1941. Once PET merged with the Gray Ranks, Wiƒôckowski was assigned to the southern scouting team SAD-400, commanded by his former classmate Andrzej Romocki. The unit specialized in minor sabotage and was referred to by the codename Wawer. Wiƒôckowski took part in Operacja Lornetka (Operation Binoculars) - an intelligence-gathering operation that allowed for the planning of another operation which concluded with the bombing of a German Wehrmacht troop transport train near Go≈ÇƒÖb on June 30, 1943. In late August 1943, Battalion Zo≈õka was established, and Wiƒôckowski was appointed Chief of the 2nd Company, nicknamed \\"Company Rudy\\". On June 1, 1944, he was appointed Chief of Security for all of Battalion Zo≈õka. He was responsible for the preparation of all platoons in the battalion during sabotage and diversion operations, which included the notable Operation Kutschera - the successful assassination of SS and Reich Police Chief of Warsaw Franz Kutschera. In 1944, Wiƒôckowski graduated from the second round of training at the underground Infantry Cadets Reserve School Agricola. Wieckowski's mother - Helena Wiƒôckowska, was a member of the secret Government Delegation for Poland subordinated to the Polish Government in Exile and helped teach in the underground's school system. =Warsaw Uprising= During the first month of the Warsaw Uprising, Wiƒôckowski fought alongside Battalion Zo≈õka in Wola and the Old Town. On the 19th day of the Uprising, Wiƒôckowski was wounded by an exploding grenade, resulting in hearing-loss in his left ear; he remained deaf in the left ear throughout the rest of his life. On August 31, along with his Company Rudy and Group A of the Kedyw Leadership, Wiƒôckowski successfully broke through German lines in the Saxon Garden to the Polish-held City Center as part of a larger, although unsuccessful, Polish operation to breakthrough to the City Center. Wiƒôckowski contributed greatly to this heroic breakthrough of his group thanks to his fluent knowledge of the German language. Upon breaking through, Wiƒôckowski made his way to the southern district of Czerniak√≥w where he made contact with the Kedyw Unit Broda 53. Afterwards, he returned to the City Center where he helped evacuate the less severely wounded soldiers to Czerniak√≥w. Sometime within the first two weeks of September, Wiƒôckowski was cut off from his Battalion Rudy, and from September 13, he fought as an adjunct to the commander of Battalion Wigry - a youth scouting unit which had taken up arms and joined the Uprising. Wiƒôckowski participated in battles which helped hold back German forces, allowing Polish civilians and resistance fighters to evacuate and retreat from Warsaw. At the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising, Wiƒôckowski found himself a POW in German captivity. He was held captive in Oflag II D Gross Born (Grossborn-Westfalenhof), Stalag X-B near Sandbostel, Fallingbostel, and in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp before being liberated by British forces from the Oflag X-C camp near L√ºbeck on May 2, 1945. Jan Wiƒôckowski's 19-year- old sister - Maria Marysia Wiƒôckowska, first served as a nurse in the Second Team of the Ole≈Ñka Platoon before serving in the communications department of First Platoon Sad, which was one of several platoons in the II Company Rudy - the very company Jan was in charge of. Wounded some-time in late August, Maria was kept in a field hospital set up by the Polish Resistance in Building #23 on Miodowa Street, known as the \\"Miodowa 23 Hospital\\". On September 2, the hospital was liquidated by German and Ukrainian forces resulting in the murders of several injured Poles - including Maria Wiƒôckowska. During the liquidation of the \\"Miodowa 23 Hospital,\\" several Greek Jews liberated previously by the Polish Resistance from Gƒôsi√≥wka were also murdered by the Germans and Ukrainians.

Upon being liberated from Oflag X-C by the British, Wiƒôckowski left for Meppen in May 1945 and joined the Polish First Armoured Division. He was transported to France, and then Great Britain. There, he was incorporated into the Polish Armed Forces in Great Britain. He was transferred to the First Corpus of the Polish Armed Forces stationed in Edinburgh. In January 1946, he moved to London where served in the staff of the Home Army Historical Commission of the Polish Commander-in-Chief, led by General Tadeusz Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski and Colonel Kazimierz Iranek-Osmecki. As the personal adjunct adjutant to the Commander- in-Chief General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, Wiƒôckowski traveled alongside the General and visited the various Polish units stationed throughout Great Britain. Additionally, Wiƒôckowski served as the First Secretary of the Circle of Home Army Veterans in London. Upon the demobilization of the Polish Armed Forces in Great Britain, Wiƒôckowski emigrated to the United States. From 1948 to 1951, Wiƒôckowski studied international economics at the Stetson University in DeLand, graduating in 1951 with a master's degree in international economics. From 1951, he worked for Girard Bank in Philadelphia, and in 1976, he was promoted to Vice-President of the bank. In 1986, he retired yet continued to work as an adviser for several financial firms. He acted as the Director of the Consultation Council of Bank Pekao in New York City. From 1990 to 1996, Wiƒôckowski served as an adviser to Bank Pekao's President in Warsaw. Wiƒôckowski was an active member of the Zo≈õkowcy Community - veterans of Battalion Zo≈õka. He donated his personal journals and documents to the Archive of the Gray Ranks. He was also a Council Member in the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. On July 11, 2008, Jan Wiƒôckowski died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. He was laid to rest at the Our Lady of Czestochowa Cemetery in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

The population was 2,956 at the 2010 census. Farmingdale is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan New England City and Town Area. History In 1852, Farmingdale incorporated as a town,http://www.mainegenealogy.net/individual_place_record.asp?place=farmingdale combining parts of South Hallowell, North Gardiner and East/West Gardiner. Many businesses existed in Farmingdale, most of them along the Kennebec River. A major business was harvesting and selling ice worldwide. The Knickerbocker Ice Company (the largest ice company in the country), and the Marshall Ice Company had ice-houses at Bowman's Point.Illustrated history of Kennebec County, Maine; 1625-1799-1892, Part 1 The Knickerbocker Ice Company burned in 1894 or 1895 leaving only the chimney that stood until it was demolished in 1911 to make room for the Central Maine Power Plant.http://historichallowell.mainememory.net/page/2499/display.html Other businesses on the river in Farmingdale included shipyards, brickyards, pottery, and a glue factory.

The band was formed in 2000 by guitarist and vocalist Jake Becker and drummer Benjamin Brenner. Since the band formed, they have released two demos, one EP, and two full-length studio albums. The band is currently signed on an international recording contract with Limb Music, based in Hamburg, Germany. Skyliner's main genres are typically considered to be power metal and progressive metal. Turning away from the fantasy-based lyrics of typical power metal, Skyliner's lyrics focus on topics such as rebellion, depression, society, and spirituality. Becker writes the musical score around his lyrics, while often lyrics are the final addition. Each song is based on Becker's own experience, especially in dealing with pain and alienation. In February, 2014, the band released their first studio album Outsiders, which contains nine tracks and is 70 minutes long. The album was released on the Limb Music record label and contained a mix of songs that appeared on earlier recordings as well as new material. __TOC__  History  = Formation = Jake Becker and Ben Brenner met at a church youth group in 2000 at ages 14 and 15, respectively. The two were mutually interested in one another because neither quite fit in with the other children. Both were new to their instruments and over the next couple years the two developed with each other, a relationship that would prove priceless as time progressed. Despite Becker's songwriting becoming significantly more focused, the two still had trouble finding talented and serious musicians who wanted to play their style of music, leading to a long roster of bassists and other members. = Early recordings = In 2005, the band assembled the demo CD Light Comes Out of Black. All of the tracks were recorded live in the studio with the exception on Becker's vocals. Kyle Sweeney joined the band as the bassist for the recording of this demo, but left later on in 2004. This release opened the door for local shows and got the band some minor publicity in the area, but during the time the album was being promoted, Becker was already working on and correcting a new batch of songs. Four years later, the self-titled demo Skyliner was released. Compared to the first CD, the new record showed a more specific identity for the band, including the addition of a keyboard, played by Cody Lewis, as well as new artwork. Bassist David Lee Redding joined for this album, and would stay with the band until 2013. During this first decade of its existence, Skyliner struggled to maintain a permanent line-up and also had difficulties putting in enough time and money to keep the band moving forward at the rate desired. However, the releases provided many lessons to the band and allowed the core synergy between Becker and Brenner to grow even stronger. Skyliner at the Murray Hill Theatre in February 2015. Setting aside the two demos' shortcomings, the band released the first EP The Alchemist in 2011. Joining with engineers Andrew Perlowich and Jamie King, the band sought to release songs that truly reflected their own style. Ashley Flynn replaced Cody Lewis on the keyboard, thus completing the line-up for the first studio album. While the songs do not differ greatly from the second demo in terms of style, the mistakes made during the recording and mastering were addressed while the demos were largely unaltered. = Signed with Limb Music = The band's first full-length studio album Outsiders was recorded in 2013 and released in February 2014. Skyliner maintained its recording line-up from the EP and again sought out Jamie King for mixing and mastering. The songs \\"Symphony in Black\\", \\"Undying Wings\\", \\"Aria of the Waters\\", and \\"The Alchemist\\" appeared in the band's previous releases and were revised to Becker's specifications before being recorded for the new album. The songs \\"Time\\" and \\"Outsiders\\" from the 2005 demo Light Comes Out of Black also make a reappearance not as songs themselves, but movements in the 21-minute finale \\"Worlds of Conflict\\". Just as the band was looking for a label with which to release Outsiders, Flynn and Redding both left the band. Shortly after their departure, Nathaniel Curtis became the band's new bassist. In autumn of 2013, Skyliner signed a contract with Limb Music. The album released worldwide on February 28, 2014, and celebrated the North American release on April 15. Described by Limb as \\"the symbiosis of classy, sophisticated song writing characteristic for the US and the traditional heavy metal values and virtues of Europe,\\" the album was met with positive reviews despite its risk-taking progressive mindset. Support of the album grew while more online reviews and magazine articles were beginning to call Skyliner \\"one of the breakout progressive power metal bands of 2014.\\"  Discography  * Light Comes Out of Black (Demo, 2005) * Skyliner (Demo, 2009) * The Alchemist (EP, 2011) * Outsiders (LP, 2014) * Condition Black (LP, 2016) * The Age Of Virgo (EP, 2018)  Members  = Present members = * Jake Becker - Guitar, vocals * Ben Brenner - Drums, percussion * Stuart Brinkman - Bass, backing vocals = Former members =  Bass  * Nathaniel Curtis (2013-2017) * David Lee Redding (2007‚Äì2013) * Code Cochran (2006‚Äì2007) * Jake Alessandrini (2005‚Äì2006) * Kyle Sweeney (2004) * Donnie Back (2000‚Äì2001)  Keyboard  * Ashley Flynn (2010‚Äì2013) * Cody Lewis (2007‚Äì2009)  References  Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Florida Category:Musical groups from Jacksonville, Florida Category:2000 establishments in Florida Category:Musical groups established in 2000 ","title":"Skyliner (band)"},{"id":"43434325","text":"A keychain with a license plate displaying the name \\"Bort\\".

The cast was composed of: Mathilde Froustey, Josua Hoffalt, Florian Magnenet, Yong-Geol Kim, Muriel Zusperreguy, Ludmila Pagliero, and Samuel Murez. Of these, three later became principal dancers and two first soloists. Notable performances and invitations include: * Sagunto en Escena, Spain, 2008 * Jardins del Cap Roig, Spain, 2009 * Festival des Arts de Saint Sauveur, Canada, 2011 * Ted Shawn Theater, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Massachusetts, US 2011 (6 performances) * Teatre Coliseo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2012 (2 performances) * Ted Shawn Theater, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Massachusetts, US 2013 (6 performances) * Andr√© Malraux Theater, Rueil-Malmaison, France 2013 (5 performances) 3e √©tage was also featured in the 2012 video advertisement for the perfume Interlude, by Amouage.  Artistic Direction Samuel Murez has been artistic director of 3e √©tage since its founding. A director is credited for each show, separately from the general artistic direction of the Company. As artistic director of 3e √©tage, Murez has stated , Chris Rohmann that he sees his primary role as fostering a specific creative culture, in which: *new work grows from a long-term shared intimacy between members of the group who each bring their various talents, personalities, and ideas to the table *work both old and new evolves continually over time, even years after its premiere *all work is many-layered, with the superficial layers being immediately accessible and enjoyable to younger or less experienced viewers, and more complex elements rewarding multiple viewings, or the more experienced eye *the group's work, on- and offstage, brings people together, regardless of their profession and/or background. 3e √©tage projects are meant to stimulate encounters and dialogue *3e √©tage puts on very high- quality shows, in return for which the audience is willing to pay a fair price. This is not a mainstream approach in France, where generous government subsidies for culture are meant to enable very low ticket prices. *3e √©tage innovates as much in all aspects of its activities as much as it does in the rehearsal studio *3e √©tage provides a helpful framework for all members of the group (artistic, technical, administrative, or other) to develop their specific talents and capabilities over time, and accompanies them throughout the different phases of their careers  Programming  From 2006 to 2009, 3e √©tage performances included work by a variety of choreographers alongside Murez's own: George Balanchine, William Forsythe, Edouard Lock, Roland Petit, Jiri Bubenicek, Jos√© Martinez, Ben van Cauwenbergh, Richard Siegal. 3e √©tage also produced performances by directors other than Samuel Murez. In 2011, 3e √©tage produced the show \\"Carte Blanche √† Agnes Letestu\\", which was artistically directed by Paris Opera Ballet \\"√âtoile\\" (Principal dancer) Agn√®s Letestu. This program was also performed in 2012, in Le Bouscat, France. Starting in 2011, most 3e √©tage performances featured one full-length work created by Murez, divided into a series of scenes of various lengths, tied together by overarching themes, motifs, and recurring characters.

History As early as 1630, a trading post was established on the eastern bank of the St. George River, then considered the boundary between New England and New France. In 1704, Thomas LeFebvre from Quebec bought a large tract of land along the Weskeag River on which he built a gristmill, with a house on the shoreline at what is now South Thomaston. The area became known as Thomas' Town. In 1719‚Äì1720, the old trading post was remodeled into Fort St. George, a stockaded fort protected by two blockhouses. But Abenaki Indian tribes protested the encroachment of an English fort on their territory. Instigated by the French, they attacked the garrison twice during Dummer's War in 1722, then again in 1723 with a siege lasting 30 days. In response to this and other provocations, soldiers destroyed the Abenaki stronghold of Norridgewock in 1724. During the French and Indian War, to avenge for the fall of Louisbourg, on August 13, 1758 French officer Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers for Fort St George (Thomaston, Maine). His detachment reached there on September 9 but was caught in an ambush and had to withdraw. This was Boish√©bert's last Acadian expedition.Phyllis E. Leblanc Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online They then went on to raid Friendship, Maine, where people were killed and others taken prisoner.The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, A. D ..., Volume 2 By William Durkee Williamson, p. 333 Hostilities of the French and Indian Wars ceased with the 1759 Fall of Quebec. Mason Wheaton was the first permanent settler in 1763. Located at the heart of the Waldo Patent, Thomaston was incorporated from St. Georges Plantation on March 20, 1777. Many settlers arrived following the Revolutionary War in 1783. General Henry Knox built his mansion, Montpelier, at Thomaston in 1793‚Äì1794. The town prospered in the early 19th century as a port and ship building center. Around 1840, two of seven recorded millionaires in the United States were Thomaston sea captains. Other industries included two gristmills, two sawmills and planing mills, three sail lofts, brickyards, cask manufacturing and a marble works. Lime had been manufactured here since 1734 in kilns. Thomaston is still home to Jeff's Marine, Inc. and Lyman Morse Boatbuilding, builders of custom power and sailing yachts. Located on the St. George River, Lyman Morse Boatbuilding sits on the original site of the General Henry Knox Mansion and where wooden schooners have been built for over 200 years. Rockland and South Thomaston were set off and incorporated in 1848. The Knox and Lincoln Railroad passed through the town, carrying freight and tourists. Thomaston was home to the Maine State Prison until 2002, when it moved to Warren and the former facility was demolished. The prison was locally famous for its shop featuring handmade wares of the prisoners and was the inspiration for the prison in the film, The Shawshank Redemption. The gift shop still exists today. The prison site had been sold to the state in 1824 by former governor William King. Today, Thomaston is a resort area with a large historic district containing Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate architecture. The town was a filming location for the 1996 film, Thinner. In June 1875, Louis Wagner (\\"the Smuttynose Axe Murderer\\"), alongside John True Gordon (\\"the Thorndike Slayer\\"), were hanged on the gallows of the Maine State Prison of Thomaston. Louis Wagner was forgotten by history until the recent book Return to Smuttynose Island and other Maine Axe Murders by Emeric Spooner. Mr. Spooner located Wagner's grave which can still be viewed in the Old Prison Cemetery on the grounds of the former prison.Emeric Spooner, Return to Smuttynose Island and other Maine Axe Murders The Thomaston Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History Boothbay Harbor ~1910 The area was part of Cape Newagen, where the English established an early seasonal fishing camp. In 1666, Henry Curtis purchased the land from the sachem Mowhotiwormet, commonly known as Chief Robinhood, who lived at what is today Woolwich. But the settlement was attacked and burned during King Philip's War, resettled shortly afterwards, then destroyed again in 1689 during King William's War. It was abandoned for 40 years. In 1730, Colonel David Dunbar, the superintendent and governor of the Territory of Sagadahock, laid out a new town, named Townsend after Viscount Townshend. Despite predations during the French and Indian Wars, and robberies during the Revolutionary War by marauding British sailors, the settlement was successful, not least because of its large, deep and protected harbor. During the Penobscot Expedition, in 1779 Townsend became a rendezvous point for the American naval fleet prior to its disastrous encounter with the British at Castine. Renamed Boothbay in 1842, the harbor continued to develop as a fishing center. In bad weather, it could hold at a time between 400 and 500 vessels, often Friendship Sloops, seeking shelter. By 1881, it had a fishery and fish oil company, an ice company, two marine railways, a fertilizer manufacturer, and a factory for canning lobsters. On February 16, 1889, the community was set off from Boothbay and incorporated as the town of Boothbay Harbor. Frank L. Sample shipyard at Boothbay Harbor built minesweepers for the United States Navy during World War II and into the 1950s. Some location filming for the 1956 movie version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel, notably the \\"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\\" sequence, was done there. Each summer, Boothbay Harbor draws crowds of tourists. Attractions include the state aquarium, art galleries, restaurants, boat tours to coastal islands and whale watching.

First called Broad Bay, the village was settled between 1733 and 1740, but suffered a devastating attack as part of the Northeast Coast Campaign (1746) by Native Americans allied with New France during King George's War. Houses were burned and inhabitants killed or carried away as captives. Survivors fled to the nearby settlements of St. George or Pemaquid. Peace returned with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1752‚Äì1753, Samuel Waldo, son of the general Jonathan Waldo, visited Germany and recruited about 1,500 immigrants to Waldoboro on the ship Lydia. Some were followers of Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli but they did not immigrate for religious reasons like the Pilgrims but for \\"...increasing their worldly goods.\\",Bliss, George.

Waldo hired Sebastian Zouberbuhler as an agent. Many settled on the western side of Broad Bay, although in 1763‚Äì1764 the land was claimed under the Pemaquid Patent. About 300 residents moved to the Moravian settlements in what is now Forsyth County, North Carolina, but the remainder bought their properties. On June 29, 1773, the township was incorporated as Waldoborough, named for the original proprietor. Waldoboro became county seat of Lincoln County in 1786, but the designation would shift to Wiscasset in 1880. Farms produced hay and potatoes. The Knox and Lincoln Railroad arrived and spurred the town's development. Industries would include an iron foundry, an oakum mill, a carding and cloth-dressing mill, a grain mill, sawmills and planing mills, furniture and molding mills, a door, sash and blind factory, and a carriage factory. There were also marble and granite yards and a pottery. But ship building was the principal business, with eight large vessels built in 1880.George J.

Graduating from Yale University at the age of nineteen, Robinson taught at Baptist State College, where he became college president in 1860. He attended Harvard Law School then successfully ran for a seat in the Missouri House of Representatives. After attending the 1864 Democratic National Convention as a delegate, Robinson decided to move to Chicago, Illinois and became a prominent lawyer there. He served two terms in the Illinois Senate in the 1870s. Biography Michael Waller Robinson was born in Fulton, Missouri on October 13, 1837. During his youth, he attended school and worked on the family farm. He attended preparatory school at Fulton College and then Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky. He was admitted to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He graduated with honors in 1857 at the age of nineteen. Returning to Missouri, he was appointed Professor of Greek and Latin at Baptist State College in Liberty. He taught for three years, assuming the presidency of the institution during the last year. In his free time, Robinson studied law under Alexander William Doniphan. Robinson matriculated at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduating in 1861. Robinson again returned to Missouri, now practicing law in Fulton with future Missouri Attorney General John A. Hockaday. In 1862, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives for a two-year term. In 1864, during the Civil War, he was arrested and held as a military prisoner for several months. Upon his release, Robinson was named a delegate to the 1864 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. He was impressed with the city and decided to re-locate there. Robinson became a leading lawyer there, partnering at times with Lambert Tree and John V. Le Moyne. He settled in Lake View, Illinois in 1870 and served several terms at town attorney. He was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1874, serving two two-year terms. Robinson was named president of the Democratic State Convention upon expiration of his second term.

The municipality is located in the state of Maine's Mid Coast region. The population was 3,732 as of the 2010 census. Home to the Chewonki Foundation, Wiscasset is a tourist destination noted for early architecture. The town is home to the Red's Eats restaurant. History In 1605, Samuel de Champlain is said to have landed here and exchanged gifts with the Indians. Situated on the tidal Sheepscot River, Wiscasset was first settled in 1660. The community was abandoned during the French and Indian Wars, and the King Philip's War in 1675 and then resettled around 1730. In 1760, it was incorporated as Pownalborough after Colonial Governor Thomas Pownall. In 1802, it resumed its original Abenaki name, Wiscasset, which means \\"coming out from the harbor but you don't see where.\\" During the Revolutionary War, the British warship Rainbow harbored itself in Wiscasset Harbor and held the town at bay until the town gave the warship essential supplies. In 1775, Captain Jack Bunker supposedly robbed the payroll of a British supply ship, Falmouth Packet, that was stowed in Wiscasset Harbor. He was chased for days and caught on Little Seal Island. His treasure reportedly has never been found. Because of the siege during the Revolutionary War, Fort Edgecomb was built in 1808 on the opposite bank of the Sheepscot to protect the town harbor. Wiscasset's prosperity left behind fine early architecture, particularly in the Federal style when the seaport was important in privateering. Two dwellings of the period, Castle Tucker and the Nickels-Sortwell House, are now museums operated by Historic New England. The seaport became a center for shipbuilding, fishing and lumber. Wiscasset quickly became the busiest seaport north of Boston until the embargo of 1807 halted much trade with England. Most of Wiscasset's business and trade was destroyed. Maine was officially admitted as a state in 1820 with the passage of the Maine-Missouri Compromise. The town of Wiscasset was considered for the state capital, but lost the position because of its proximity to the ocean. During the Civil War, Wiscasset had many of its residents that joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Its regiment was commended for fighting bravely at the Battle of Gettysburg. Rail service to Wiscasset began with the Knox and Lincoln Railroad in 1871. The Knox and Lincoln was merged into the Maine Central Railroad in 1901. Wiscasset was connected to the national rail network by the completion of the Carlton bridge over the Kennebec River in 1927. Nickels-Sortwell House, built 1807 Wiscasset was the seaport terminal and standard gauge interchange of the 2-foot gauge Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington Railway. Construction began in Wiscasset in 1894. Train service began in 1895 as the Wiscasset and Quebec Railroad. By 1913, the railroad operated daily freight and passenger service 43.5 miles north to Albion with an 11-mile freight branch from Weeks Mills to North Vassalboro. Passengers and freight increasingly used highway transportation after World War I. Frank Winter bought the railroad about 1930 to move lumber from Branch Mills to his schooners Hesper and Luther Little. During the early 1930s the early morning train from Albion to Wiscasset and the afternoon train back to Albion carried the last 2-foot gauge railway post office (RPO) in the United States. A derailment of the morning train in Whitefield on June 15, 1933, terminated railroad operations before the schooners could be loaded with lumber for shipment to larger coastal cities. The two schooners were abandoned in Wiscasset shortly after Winter's premature demise in 1936, and they eventually became tourist attractions. Over the next 62 years, the weathered vessels became widely photographed as they were visible from a bridge along U.S. 1 that runs by the town. Wiscasset officials finally removed the rotted remains in 1998, after a violent storm took out the final masts.

In these tales of adventure and humor, events by turns perilous and comic occur in Wiscasset, including the hunt for an escaped circus bear and a pursuit and gun battle on the Sheepscott River off the shores of the town. Certain historic homes and landmarks, including the Old Jail, form part of the settings; and at least two characters ‚Äì County Sheriff Charles Piper and Jailer Seth Patterson - are based on real people. The books in the series in which Wiscasset plays an important part are Cordelia Underwood, or the Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League; Mollie Peer, or the Underground Adventure of the Moosepath League; and Daniel Plainway, or the Holiday Haunting of the Moosepath League. The climax of Reid's novel Peter Loon takes place in Wiscasset in 1801, using as its centerpiece of action an historic fomenting rebellion among back-country settlers and an actual escape that was successfully executed from the town's original jail. In interviews, Reid has said that his having lived upriver in Sheepscott Village when young as well as tales of his father's childhood in 1930s Wiscasset has caused Wiscasset to ‚Äúloom large‚Äù in his imagination. Industry From 1972 until 1996, Wiscasset was home to Maine Yankee, a pressurized water reactor on Bailey Point, and the only nuclear power plant in the state. The Maine Yankee nuclear power plant was decommissioned in 1996 and is inoperative. Since the closing of Maine Yankee, Wiscasset faced a severe loss in jobs, residents, and public school enrollment. In a high school graduation speech delivered by Bradley Whitaker, he stated, \\"The loss of those jobs changed our community, the surrounding towns and our school system. We've all had friends move away, our parents have had their taxes rise dramatically, enrollment has plummeted, we've watched teachers and administrators leave, programs and sports eliminated.\\"http://www.timesrecord.com/articles/2010/06/11/news/doc4c12688cd2afa439237004.txt The town attempted to replace Maine Yankee with a gasification plant in 2007, but the plan subsequently failed due to a town vote.http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=115x120219 Wiscasset was also home of the Mason Station, a coal and steam-powered plant along the Sheepscot River south of town that first went online in 1941.

The fire emitted a substantial amount of smoke which made it seem worse than it was. A video by photographer Keith Brooks was obtained by local media and was presented on NBC Nightly News. While the fire was not a significant threat, many locals believed it was a major concern for the environment, which caused several referendums to have the nuclear plant closed.

This was the fourteenth time that CMLL used the name \\"Jucio Final\\" for one of their major shows. The main event of the show was a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match between Rush and Negro Casas. The undercard featured an additional Lucha de Apuestas match where the team of Marcela and Princesa Sugehit putting their hair and mask on the line against Princess Blanca and La Seductora who are also risking their hair and mask respectively on the outcome of the match. The show also featured a match between long time rivals La Sombra and Volador Jr. for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship and three additional matches. Production La Sombra who lost the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship on the show. =Background= For decades Arena M√©xico, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. Until 2000 the Jucio Final name was always used for the year end show, but since 2000 has at times been used for shows outside of December. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The focal point of the Juicio Final show was the long running storyline feud between the rudo Negro Casas and Rush that started over a year earliere. The earliest encounters between the two came in clashes between Casas' team La Peste Negra (\\"The Black Plague\\"; El Felino and Mr. Niebla) and Rush, Marco Corleone and M√°ximo, a team known as El Bufete del Amor (\\"The Law of Love\\") but later escalated to a personal issue between Casas and Rush. Their rivalry led the two to be included in the main event of the 2013 Infirno en el Ring Steel cage match alongside eight other wrestlers. Both Rush and Negro Casas escaped the cage without losing their hair. By the end of 2013 the storyline began to also include Shocker, who turned rudo and sided with Casas in the feud. On February 18, 2014 La Peste Negra defeated Rush and his teammates La M√°scara and Tit√°n to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. In the weeks following the title change Rush, Casa and Shocker all agreed to a three-way match under Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet match\\") rules where the loser would be shaved bald. The match was originally planned for the March 21 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas event, but Negro Casas dropped out of the match, declaring that he would rather face the winner later on. Rush defeated Shocker, forcing Shocker to be shaved bald after the event and immediately set his sights on Negro Casas. For months Rush had displayed less of a \\"fan favorite\\" or tecnico attitude during his matches without actually turning rudo in the process. Following the Homenaje show Rush began teaming with La Sombra, who was also displaying a more rudo attitude, announcing themselves as \\"t√©cnicos diferentes\\" (\\"A different kind of good guy\\"). Soon after they were joined by La M√°scara, to become a trio known as Los Indeseables (\\"The Undesirables\\"), later renamed Los Ingobernables (\\"The Ungovernables\\"). Casas and La M√°scara won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, but later lost the title to Negro Casas and Shocker. Marcela (in blue) and Princesa Blanca (in black), both put their hair on the line. Tit√°n was originally slated to compete in the fifth match of the night, but the day before the event it was announced that M√°scara Dorada would replace him, due to Tit√°n being unable to compete because of a foot injury. The fourth match of the evening was another chapter in a long running feud between Volador Jr. and La Sombra, this time with La Sombra defending the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship. Volador Jr. and La Sombra were originally a very successful tag team from 2008 to 2010, even holding the CMLL World Tag Team Championship for 542 days. The partnership ended when Volador Jr. turned on his partner in 2010, sparking a long running storyline between the two. Over the years La Sombra and Volador Jr. traded championships, even teamed together to win the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament. On September 13, 2013 La Sombra defeated Volador Jr. in the main event of CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, forcing Volador Jr. to unmask. Following the match La Sombra began experiencing fan opinion turning against him and actually siding with Volador Jr. during subsequent encounters. In early 2014 Volador Jr. turned tecnico again, something that did not please La Sombra, especially when they were teamed up together. In subsequent months La Sombra joined forces with Rush and later La M√°scara to form the group Los Ingobernables. On June 6, La Sombra defeated Volador Jr. to win the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship, with help from Rush and La M√°scara.

The population was 3,449 at the 2010 census. Fryeburg is home to Fryeburg Academy, a semi-private preparatory school, and the International Musical Arts Institute. The town is also site of the Fryeburg Fair, which each October attracts approximately 300,000 visitors. History The area was once a major Abenaki Indian village known as Pequawket, meaning \\"crooked place,\\" a reference to the large bend in the Saco River. It was inhabited by the Sokokis tribe, whose territory along the stream extended from what is now Saco on the coast, to Conway, New Hampshire in the White Mountains. In 1706, Chief Nescambious would be the only Indian knighted by the French. For a while the tribe was not hostile to English settlements, even hiring British carpenters to build at Pequawket a high palisade fort as protection against their traditional enemy, the Mohawks. In 1713, Sokokis sachems signed the Treaty of Portsmouth to ensure peace with English colonists. Eventually, relations with the English soured. During Father Rale's War, Pequawket was attacked in the Battle at Pequawket on May 8, 1725, by John Lovewell and his militia.John Grenier. The Far Reaches of Empire. University of Oklahoma Press. 2008 Lovewell was killed, as were Chief Paugus and others. The tribe subsequently abandoned the village and moved to Canada. The township was granted on March 3, 1762, by the Massachusetts General Court to Colonel Joseph Frye of Andover, Massachusetts. Colonists called it Pigwacket, a corruption of its former name. The first permanent settlement was in 1763 by Nathaniel Smith and his family from Concord, New Hampshire, though it is said that John Stevens, Nathaniel Merrill and a slave named Limbo spent the winter of 1762 here. Many pioneers were veterans of the French and Indian Wars. When a portion of the grant was discovered to lie in New Hampshire, replacement land was granted as Fryeburg Addition in what is now part of Stow. On the eve of American independence, the Province of Massachusetts Bay granted township privileges to Fryeburg. These were recognized and validated by the Continental Massachusetts government on January 11, 1777, when Fryeburg was incorporated. It began as a strategic frontier outpost, and the earliest town in the White Mountain region. Excellent soil helped Fryeburg develop into a prosperous agricultural center, and the first gristmill was established using Saco River water power in 1766. Other mills and factories produced lumber, leather, harness, tinware, cheese and canned vegetables. After the Civil War, the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad passed through town, bringing tourists escaping the heat and pollution of cities. Inns, hotels and boarding houses were built. Tourists began arriving by automobile after designation of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919 (identified as United States Route 302 since 1935). Fryeburg is today a year-round resort area. It is also an academic town. Fryeburg Academy, a private preparatory school, was founded in 1792. Before his career as a statesman, Daniel Webster taught for a year at the school, one of the oldest of its type in the nation. In 1924, Dr. Abraham Krasker founded Indian Acres Camp For Boys. Two years later, Dr. Krasker's wife Gertrude founded Forest Acres Camp For Girls. In 1997, the International Musical Arts Institute was founded at Fryeburg.

The population was 5,014 at the 2010 census. It is home to Lake Pennesseewassee, a recreation area. History Fertile soil and abundant fauna surrounding the Pennessewasse Lake supported native people in the region for thousands of years. It wasn't until after the American Revolution that European settlers established the town of Norway. In 1786, Joseph Stevens, George Leslie, Amos Hobbs, Jeremiah Hobbs, Jonas Stevens, and Nathaniel Stevens began clearing land and building homes. They intended to not only provide for their families, but also attract new settlers to their small community. Many of the early settlers had fought in the Revolutionary War, including Phineas Whitney, a veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill. By 1789, a sawmill and gristmill were established, the first road was built in 1796, and the town of Norway was officially incorporated on March 9, 1797. Before incorporation, the township adopted the name Rustfield, to recognize the contributions of prominent landowner Henry Rust of Salem, Massachusetts, and the community once petitioned the Massachusetts General Court to be named Norage, meaning \\"falls\\" in the native peoples' language. still, the origin of the town's current name remains unknown.Origins of the Name: Norway, Maine During the Civil War, Norway and other municipalities in Oxford County formed a militia that joined the 1st Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment under the command of George Lafayette Beal. Beal would later rise to the rank of major general and serve as State Treasurer from 1888 to 1894. With fertile soil for cultivation and access to the Pennesseewassee waterways, which drain into the Little Androscoggin River, the community had ample water power to drive industrial manufacturing, including a cloth and carding mill, a furniture factory, a box factory, and a shovel handle factory. Waterfalls powered two grain mills. Businesses like the tannery, the harness maker, and the trunk manufacturer emerged. Shoe manufactory was established in 1872. The busy stage route from Paris, the county seat, to Fryeburg passed through Norway. By 1878, there were 32 stores in the town. For a number of years, Norway had the fastest growing population of any similar town in the state. On December 30, 1879, the Norway Branch Railroad opened. The 1.45 mile (2.3 km) line connected Norway village with the Atlantic St. Lawrence Railroad (later Grand Trunk Railroad) at South Paris.\\"Historical Sketch of Norway, Maine\\", Boston, Massachusetts 1889 On May 9, 1894, a fire sparked in the C. B. Cummings & Sons mill on Main Street. Spread by a strong wind, what would become known as The Great Norway Fire, destroyed a substantial portion of the business district, devastating the opera house, Congregational Church, tannery, and 80 other buildings, including many homes. Reconstruction began the same year, and many of the original wooden buildings on Main Street were rebuilt with brick.Oxford County Genealogy Notebook ‚Äì Norway, Maine Norway, Maine was once known as the \\"Snowshoe Capital of the World.\\" Walter Tubbs founded the Tubbs Snowshoe Company 1906. Tubbs produced high quality ash snowshoes, skis, sleds, and furniture, even supplying Byrd and Peary's polar expeditions. Tubbs relocated to Vermont in the early 1930s. Soon after, SnoCraft Inc., a company owned and operated by Kenneth (Kac) Aldrich, set up production in the old Tubbs Factory. SnoCraft was responsible for supplying 70% of the snowshoes ordered by the U.S. government during World War II. Founded in 1850, the C. B. Cummings & Son Company mass-produced wooden components like dowels in downtown Norway. In 2001, after domestic furniture manufacturers were unable to compete with production costs in China, the company closed and auctioned their factory. Similarly, after K2 Sports bought Tubbs Snowshoe Company in 2014, production moved from Vermont to Guangzhou, China.Business People, Vermont ‚Äì Tubbs Snowshoe Company In 1997, the New Balance Shoe Company built a manufacturing facility in Norway where production continues today.

A Manchester company installed the country's first regular telephone system in the city, wiring solutions which were adopted across Britain were initiated in Manchester and Stockport, the city was (arguably) the site of the UK's first telephone exchange and a service which was the forerunner of modern mobile phones was controlled from the city.  UK‚Äôs first regular telephone service  In November 1877, while telephony was in its infancy, just 18 months after Alexander Graham Bell had made the world's first phone call, Charles Moseley, the son of a Manchester rubber manufacturer (then making telegraph equipment), took an interest in Bell's work. Moseley employed an engineer called William Fereday Bottomley to obtain telephone instruments from the Bell Company in Boston, United States, and provided the Post Office with its first telephones. Bell himself had first demonstrated the telephone to Queen Victoria who placed the UK's first long-distance call from Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 14 January 1878. Just twelve days later, after obtaining a licence from the Post Office, Moseley installed a telephone between a hardware merchant's establishment (Thomas Hudson Ltd) on Shudehill, Manchester to the offices of the company on Dantzic Street: the first such telephone in regular use in the country Telephone manufacturers Moseley and Sons as a licensed telephone agent supplied private telephones to local customers. Their head of construction, Alexander Marr, patented in 1879, a type of granular carbon microphone (originally for the transmission of the sound of opera), which enabled them to get a foothold in the business of manufacturing telephones in the UK. Together with another local company (Peel Connor) they both supplied the first telephone apparatus to the Post Office and also to railway companies and other private enterprises.  Engineering pioneers  An experimental system for separating wires on telephone poles was erected from Manchester to Stockport and another to Oldham. This ‚Äútwist‚Äù system (though never patented) was universally adopted in the UK for pole- mounted wiring.  First telephone exchange  There are claims that Manchester was also home to the UK's first telephone exchange after a reported July 1879 commencement of operations by 'Lancashire Telephonic Exchange Limited' (LTE) on Faulkner Street using equipment licensed under Bell's patent. LTE joint manager James Lorrain claimed that their exchange opened in July 1879 ‚Äì effectively making Britain's first.(this claim is disputed). It is certainly known that the Telephone Company opened two exchanges in London in August 1879 (the first was an Edison exchange in Queen Victoria Street, the second, a Bell company one, was situated in Coleman Street, both in the City of London), and there was also a very early exchange in Glasgow. David Moseley & Sons planned to open their own telephone exchange in their warehouse on Manchester's New Brown Street but before this happened in October of that year, the 'Lancashire and Cheshire Telephonic Exchange' company bought Moseley's licence to stall his opening. Other reports (for example from the Manchester Guardian) suggest the first Manchester exchange opened in mid- September 1879. A second telephone exchange opened in Manchester during 1880 run by the 'Edison Telephone Company of London Ltd'. The Museum of Science and Industry holds the earliest surviving list of telephone subscribers in Manchester (for the Edison Manchester and District Telephonic Exchange), which consists of a printed list of 125 subscribers, with one handwritten deletion and 13 handwritten additions.  Consolidation of local telephone companies and trunk lines  By 1881 the Lancashire exchanges had 420 subscribers. By March of that year the Edison and Bell companies were merged forming the United Telephone Company (13 May 1880). To consolidate the two companies operations in Manchester, The Lancashire & Cheshire Telephonic Exchange Company (LCTEC) was set up in the original Faulkner Street offices and exchange building. By 1888 the LCTE had opened a new switchboard in the city's main trading area, the Royal Exchange (location of 5 soundproof telephone boxes ‚Äì which in March 1881 were used to place 430 calls in one day). The equipment which had the potential capacity for over 4000 subscribers, was manufactured by Western Electric and installed under the direction of Joseph Poole. The first permanent trunk line between two distant cities was not installed between Manchester and Liverpool until 1910.,Economic History of London, 1800‚Äì1914 Professor Michael Ball, David T Sunderland but lesser connections were possible from south east Lancashire via connecting lines to Birmingham, Bradford, Huddersfield, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Sheffield ‚Äì at a time when it is understood that (despite the experimental connections between the Isle of Wight and another to Norwich, both in 1878) the sole permanent long-distance telephone trunk line connection from the capital was to Brighton. During the late 1880s the National Telephone Company was engaged in a series of amalgamations and however it was not until 1889 that national consolidation was achieved when the LCTE, which by then had 1551 lines, and United Telephone and the National Telephone Co were brought together. The resulting merger was called the National Telephone Company of Britain (NTC) and this company continued in existence until 1911 when it was compulsorily purchased by the Postmaster General. One Manchester telephony company held out against take over for several years: the Mutual Telephone Company (MTC) had opened a rival exchange to the LCTE in Manchester in February 1891. They offered cheaper call rates but their equipment was said to be inferior to their competitors. After only a year of operation it was bought out by the New telephone Company which itself was absorbed by the NTC in 1896.  Telephone exchange staff  During their early years of operation, it was young boys who the exchanges first employed, but as they caused problems, women were increasingly taken on as the main body of staff. Becoming a Telephone Operator was seen as a respectable employment for middle-class women. The Museum of Science & Industry cites the case of Annie Wright who started work as an operator in 1892 for the MTC. When it was taken over by the NTC she was promoted to supervisor. By 1907 she became Clerk in Charge of the Manchester Central Exchange which was the largest outside London.  Exchange names  As the number of subscribers and exchanges proliferated in Manchester and surrounding areas new names were needed for exchanges. In the central area those used included ARDwick, BLAckfriars, CENtral, CHEetham Hill, COLlyhurst, DEAnsgate, MOSs Side and RUSholme. As in London there were also permutations that were required that were not based on genuine geographic names but corresponded to letters on the rotary dial for example PYRamid (covering Northenden ‚Äì NOR could not be used as the numbers 6, 0 and 7 were already used by MOSs Side), MAIn (covering Oldham ‚Äì as areas starting with ‚ÄúO‚Äù could not be used), and MERcury (covering Heald Green as HEA was already in use (HEAton Moor)). Cheadle was covered by GATley as CHE was already in use for CHEetham Hill).  Automatic exchanges & the Director system  Bakelite 232L, Pyramid' Telephone with Manchester Dailling Codes Drawer Card The first UK public automatic exchange was brought into service at Epsom, Surrey, in May 1912 using the American Strowger 'step-by-step' system. It allowed subscribers to dial the local number themselves (instead of asking the operator to connect them manually). A permanent \\"junction telephone service\\" was inaugurated between Liverpool and Manchester during 1914. In 1922 the practice of using the first three letters of an exchange name was introduced in London, Manchester and Birmingham in preparation for automatic dialling. By 1924 there were over a quarter of million lines connected to more than 40 automatic exchanges. The main problem in large cities was directing a call over a complex series of interlinking circuits. The first fully automatic system in a large urban area was under an advanced form of the Strowger concept (which enabled one exchange to be connected automatically to another). Called the Director telephone system, this was first tried on a large scale in London's Holborn Tandem exchange in 1927. The concept was envisaged to be effective for many major built-up areas and the first three exchanges outside London to be 'cut-over' to the automatic Director system were: Ardwick, Collyhurst and Moss Side in Manchester during 1930. The exchanges covering the city centre and some suburbs with 7 and a half miles were progressively converted to the same system during the next few years. The automation process meant that a large number of mainly female telephone operators in the Manchester exchanges became redundant ‚Äì a crisis that was mentioned in Parliament in 1933. But it had revolutionised call-making across the city. For example, subscribers in Collyhurst and Moss Side were then able to dial the letters A (=2), R (=7) and D (=3) followed by the four digit Ardwick subscribers number to connect them directly without talking with an operator. (3 exchanges in Birmingham were next, in 1931, one in Glasgow in 1937, one in Liverpool in 1941, Edinburgh's automatic system did not start until 1950). By the time the system was superseded in 1966, there were around 50 three-letter exchange name codes in the Manchester Automatic System (list inside a telephone drawer, pictured), more than in any other director area outside the capital.  Subscriber Trunk Dialling  Automatically dialled calls from Manchester to other cities were possible from 1954 onwards (for example it was possible to dial automatically without involvement of a manual operator to most exchanges in London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Bristol). But the switching on of the STD equipment in December 1958 meant that it was possible for almost 430 exchanges across Britain to be dialled automatically.  Car radio-phone  1960 Post office Electrical Engineers Journal A system which is cited as being the forerunner of the modern mobile phone, was first launched from the Peterloo telephone exchange in Manchester in 1959. Initially called the 'Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service', it was inaugurated on 28 October and along with South Lancs also covered North Cheshire and parts of The Wirral. The signals were operated through two antennas (one on Liverpool's Lancaster House, and the other at Horwich on Winter Hill, with an in-fill for the City Centre on Manchester's Telephone House.). A map coverage map was published in the 1960 Post Office Engineers Journal (pictured) along with detailed technical specifications of the system. It was possible for customers to make or receive phone calls to and from any UK telephone subscriber (via an operator) from an apparatus installed inside their car. If the motorist drove outside of the South Lancashire coverage area the signal would drop out as there were no other transmitters equipped to take the calls until the service was switched on for Londoners in 1965 and to other major urban centres by summer 1972.  All-Figure Dialling  The telephone exchange in Didsbury, built 1961 By the early 1960s, following the introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialling, the number of possible exchange name permutations were running out in London and the potential expansion of international direct dialling (where different letters were assigned to alternate numbers than those on UK phones) called for the creation of an alternative, modern system of numbering. Called All Figure Numbering, the first three letters of the exchange name (e.g. CENtral) were to be permanently replaced by digits (in this example: 236). The first six places to introduce the system were the Director cities including Manchester ‚Äì the process began in 1966. London was allocated the simplest primary code of ‚Äò01‚Äô. Manchester was then given a new dialling code of ‚Äò061‚Äô, the number 6 corresponded with the letter ‚ÄòM‚Äô on the dial (The 2 of Birmingham's 021 corresponded with B, Edinburgh's 031 with E, Glasgow's 041 the G and Liverpool's L with the 5 giving 051). The start of the changeover was also used to group batches of numbers into \\"sectors\\" so that subscribers could more easily identify in which part of the conurbation the number was based. In Greater Manchester for example, all of the numbers starting with the digit 3 were located in the eastern side of the urban area. On the more westerly side of the central area, were numbers commencing with 8, etc. (see map pictured). However some previous exchange names didn't fit the pattern so it was not possible for all of the old exchange name mapping to be kept. Therefore, during the period 1966‚Äì1970, some subscribers were allocated new 3 digit exchange numbers (for example ALTrincham was previously reached by the numbers 258, but it was re-allocated the new numbers: 061 928 xxxx so that all the numbers starting with 9 were in the south western sector. BLAckfriars ‚Äì previously 252 ‚Äì became 834 so that it fitted the inner western sector. Longford (which covered parts of Chorlton), previously 506, was transferred to 865. Since it was the only former exchange name which started with the 5 digit, numbers beginning 061 5xx xxxx were never allocated (until 2015, when a small number of new levels - 0161 5xx xxxx - were released into circulation, primarily for business customers). Most of the switch to All Figure Numbering was achieved in the mid to late 1960s, however the switchover took until 1970 for all 061 exchanges to be converted. Since the 1990s and the introduction of private operators (e.g. Mercury Communications, Nynex, Virgin Media etc.), plus the natural exhaustion of certain number ranges, the \\"sector\\" concept has broken down, and it is now possible to find numbers commencing with digits that do not fit their original 1960's geographical districts. Map of approximate location of Exchange area names used in Manchester between 1928‚Äì1965. They were phased out over the next 2 years, to be replaced with All-Figure Numbers, and the dialling code \\"061\\".  Transatlantic dialling  Having completed the switchover to numbers rather than letters, the six British cities on the Director system were first given access to transatlantic dialling in 1971 which enabled callers from Manchester to ring directly to any US mainline number by prefixing the call with '0101'. International Direct Dialling (IDD) was not made available nationwide until 1982.  Confravision  Despite the fact that the concept did not really take off at the time, 'Confravision', the world's first public bothway television system, allowed conference facilities to groups of people in different cities. It was made available by the Post Office at its studios in Manchester and four other locations from 1972.  Telephone directory redesign  Set of Manchester Area Telephone Directories from 1975 When lists of subscribers were first produced in the 1880s there were so few that entire regions of the UK could easily be accommodated in little more than pamphlets. By the 1920s most telephone directories covered just counties or parts thereof. In 1922 MPs raised the possibility of adding Bolton and Bury to the Manchester Telephone directory (Oldham and Rochdale were already included). The number of subscribers increased exponentially after the Second World War (reaching 5.7 million by March 1952 for example). London's telephone directories were split (initially into 2 books in 1931: A-K and L-Z) and eventually into four (A-D, E-K, L-R and S-Z) in the 1940s. From the 1970 issue onwards, Manchester was the only other UK urban area which, owing to the large number of subscribers, also required a split into two separate directories (A-K and L-Z, pictured, 1975 editions). Due to the huge print run and cost of production, the split was discontinued in 1977 with the first appearance of the 'Manchester Central' edition. Over the next 18 months Greater Manchester was divided up geographically ‚Äì into 'Manchester North East', 'Manchester North West' and 'Manchester South'), so that split alphabetical directories were no longer required and each was more relevant to its local area. Design consultants Wolff Olins were appointed in 1983 to re-design the UK's phone directories using type which took up less space and therefore less paper, ink, weight in transportation etc. The first revised look directory (called \\"The Phone Book\\") was produced for 'Central Manchester' in March 1984.  Current situation  There are now over 660 levels assigned under the 0161 code (second only in the UK to the number assigned under the 020 code for London), although this includes numbers set aside as \\"Free for National Dialling Only\\" (for example: 0161 002 xxxx). With more than 200 telecoms operators (the most prolific still being BT,) the 0161 code area also has the UK's second largest number of operators outside the capital.

The population was 4,110 at the 2010 census. Oxford is home to the Oxford Plains Speedway, the annual Oxford County Fair, and Oxford Casino. The town includes the village of Welchville. History The land was part of Plantation (also called Bog Brook Plantation), granted on March 8, 1777 by the Massachusetts General Court to Alexander Shepard, Jr. of Newton, Massachusetts. On March 6, 1792, the plantation was incorporated as Hebron, with Oxford its southwesterly portion. First settled in 1794, Oxford was set off and incorporated on February 27, 1829. It annexed land from Otisfield in 1830, and from Paris in 1838. The town was named after Oxford, in England. Farmers grew mostly hay, and the town became noted for cattle. Mills were established at 2 water power sites; these developed in the 19th-century into principal villages within the town, especially after the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s. Welchville was located on the Little Androscoggin River, where the woolen textile mill of the Harper Manufacturing Company was established. At the outlet of Thompson Lake was Oxford village, first called Craigie's Mill for the sawmill and gristmill built by Andrew Craigie, a Boston apothecary and land speculator. This was also the site of a grisly murder that, to this day, goes unsolved. Here were erected a barrel stave mill, a shovel handle factory, and the woolen textile mills of the Robinson Manufacturing Company. The railroad brought seasonal tourists to Thompson Lake, where inns and hotels opened. Today, Oxford is a recreational area with fine architecture remaining from its prosperous mill town past. The Congregational Church, built in 1842‚Äì1843, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town was hit by an F1 tornado on Saturday, June 5, 2010, causing some serious damage.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background As of 2013, Florida was the U.S. state that \\"leads the nation when it comes to federal tax return identity theft.\\" In 2011, the Internal Revenue Service \\"found 938,664 tax returns involving identity theft and $6.5 billion in fraudulent refunds.\\" In 2012, the House voted in a voice vote to pass a previous version of this bill, the Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2012 (), but the United States Senate never voted on the bill. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013 or the STOP Identity Theft Act of 2013 would call for the United States Attorney General to: (1) make use of all existing resources of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), including task forces, to bring more perpetrators of tax return identity theft to justice; and (2) take into account the need to concentrate efforts in areas of the country where the crime is most frequently reported, to coordinate with state and local authorities to prosecute and prevent such crime, and to protect vulnerable groups from becoming victims or otherwise being used in the offense. The bill would amend the federal criminal code to: (1) include organizations as victims for purposes of prohibitions against identity theft or aggravated identity theft, and (2) subject an identity theft offense committed during and in relation to tax fraud to a fine and/or up to 20 years' imprisonment. The bill would direct the Attorney General to include in the first annual DOJ performance report made more than nine months after the date of this Act's enactment information as to progress in implementing this Act regarding: (1) information readily available to DOJ about trends in the incidence of tax return identity theft, (2) the effectiveness of statutory tools in aiding DOJ in prosecuting it, (3) recommendations on additional statutory tools that would aid in removing barriers to effective prosecution, and (4) the status of implementing DOJ's March 2010 audit report on DOJ efforts to combat identity theft. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on July 16, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 744 would direct the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to better utilize its existing resources to combat identity theft related to the filing of tax returns. The department currently allocates its funding to investigate and prosecute a wide range of criminal activity, including identity theft. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that the legislation could result in a reallocation of DOJ resources, but we estimate that implementing the bill would have no significant net cost to the federal government. Enacting H.R. 744 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 744 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 15, 2013 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D, FL-23). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. The bill was scheduled to be voted on in the House under a suspension of the rules on September 8, 2014. Debate and discussion The National Association of Counties (NACO) supported the bill, placing it on their agenda to \\"urge Congress to pass legislation supporting action to reduce tax crimes and identity theft.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Identity theft in the United States References External links About the bill: *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 744 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 744 *GovTrack.us H.R. 744 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 744 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 744 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 744 About identity theft: * Identity theft ‚Äì United States Federal Trade Commission * The President‚Äôs Task Force on Identity Theft ‚Äì a government task force established by US President George W.

Thelsford Priory was a small house, originally of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, located near the banks of the River Avon close to the Warwick to Wellesbourne road. It was colonised from the Priory of the Holy Sepulchre in nearby Warwick. It was a house of Trinitarian friars and was founded at the beginning of the thirteenth century. It was dedicated to God, St. John the Baptist and St. Radegund. A grant was made between 1200 and 1212 by Henry and Isabel de Beresford which gave the church of nearby Barford mentions canons, indicating the priory may have begun life as a house of the short-lived Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1214 the house was granted 13 acres of land adjacent to the house and further land nearby by Sir William Lucy of Charlecote. He also granted the advowson of Charlecote church and half a virgate of land. He expressed a wish that the house should be used not only as a priory but also as a hospital for the relief of the local poor and for the use of pilgrims.A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 2 Sir William's grandson Fulk Lucy gave the friars permission to enclose the road which passed between the church and habitation. A later Sir William Lucy gave them a further two acres of land adjacent to the priory precinct. William de Nasford, lord of Barford, granted further lands and the advowson of Barford church. He also granted three virgates of land which became known as the Free Hide which were exempt from secular service. He also granted fishing rights on the A Richard Malore granted lands at Kirkby in Leicestershire together with the advowson of the church there. He also gave them the chapels at Shilton and Packington. A further benefactor was William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick who granted three parcels of land. Roger de Charlecote gave lands and tenements at Heathcote. These and other smaller gifts enabled the priory to expand the conventual buildings and a larger church to be built. The new church and churchyard were consecrated by Bishop Giffard on the Feast of the Translation in 1285. In 1312 during the priorship of Simon de Charlecote the house was involved in a scandal which resulted in the prior and brethren being excommunicated. Their crime was the fabrication of letters of Pope Clement. The bishop of Worcester issued a commission to the deans of Hampton and Warwick to publicly absolve the house. November 1329 saw Edward III, then staying at nearby Kenilworth, confirming a large number of small grants to Prior Thomas de Offyngton and the brethren. A few years later, in 1332, Prior Thomas de Offyngton was granted a licence to acquire lands and rents in mortmain to an annual value of 10 marks. Two years later they gained in a similar fashion protection for three years to collect alms. This was gained by virtue of an indulgence granted by the Pope to the Trinitarian order. May 1337 saw the house having confirmation of a number of small grants in mortmain on the payment of a fine of 1 mark. A description of the interior of the church at the time of the dissolution survives and makes interesting reading. Dr London wrote to Cromwell in the capital stating that the house was \\"in much ruin\\" and that the church was \\"little and unfinished\\". At the eastern end of the church was an image known locally as the \\"Maiden Cutbroghe\\". This statue had a wooden trough beneath her feet which extended into the altar (which was hollow). The image was said to be effective in the cure of headaches. Dr London wrote, \\"Thither resorted such as had headache or had any slottich widow locks, viz., hair grown together in a tuft. There must they put a peck of oats into the trough, and when they were once slid under the altar the friars stole them out from behind, and the sick must pay a penny for a pint of these Maiden Cutbrogh oats, and then their heads should ache no more till the next time.\\"Henry Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative of English History, series 3 vol. 3 (London, 1846), p. 132, slightly modernised here: 'Friaries: Trinitarian friars of Thelsford', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 2 (1908), pp. 106‚Äì88  Dissolution and After  The religious life of the priory came to an end on 26 October 1538 when Prior Edmund David and three other members of the house signed the surrender document passing ownership of the house to the King. Following its surrender the church was demolished and much of the stone was reused in other structures, mainly at Thelsford Farm and Wasperton Manor. The priory ponds and other low lying areas of the site were backfilled with debris and the area was turned over to grazing. The site of the priory was excavated in the 1960s and again in 1972. These digs provided much information about the layout of the buildings and other features of the priory. Many of these features still survive underground. The thirteenth- century church was cruciform in plan but the original building was a single- celled rectangular building which was extended in the early fourteenth century. This buildings foundations still survive below ground. The cloisters and its associated buildings were located on the south side of the church. They were largely of timber construction. The western range was built of timber on stone footings which still survive below ground. The areas to the north and west of the claustral buidongs were bounded by walls and probably served as gardens. Apart from the claustral complex itself several areas of buildings have been found within the precinct, particularly in the western part of the site. These structures probably relate to the hospital and pilgrim structures. There are no visible remains of this long-forgotten priory. Part of the site lies below the main A429 road a little to the north of Thelsford Farm. Incomplete list of priors * Elias 1247 * Robert temp. r.

His mother Theodora Wilson, had met Rudolf Steiner and visited the first Goetheanum. For some years he was a professional violinist and conductor. He studied at the Goetheanum and became fluent in German. Later he was a founder and director of the first curative home in the UK. He translated a number of Rudolf Steiner‚Äôs works and researched and lectured on Goethe's Theory of Colours. Although at school Michael had specialized in Physics and Chemistry, with a view to taking over the successful chemical plant his father owned and ran, he decided to study Violin and Conducting at the Royal Academy of Music. He later (1929) became second conductor of the British National Opera Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli, played as Concert Master under Sir Thomas Beecham and was a close friend of Sir Adrian Boult. A meeting with the German curative educator, Fried Geuter, in 1929 caused him to break off a successful musical career. Lady Cynthia Chance has described this in her memoirs. She was invited to a lecture by a Mrs Lloyd Wilson (Michael Wilson‚Äôs mother) who ran an Anthroposophical study group in the area, to be held by Fried Geuter:\\\\- Lady Cynthia Chance ‚ÄòMy Life as a Student of Anthroposophy\` The Progonion ‚Äì Family Memoirs publisher=1cha.co.uk/ accessdate=2014-07-28 :‚ÄúMichael Wilson did not take seriously this side of his mother‚Äôs life and did not come to the lecture. But afterwards he began to talk to this lecturer, who seemed rather different from those who usually came to speak or attended the meetings. Michael, a professional musician, studied at the Royal College of Music, at that time under Sir Adrian Boult. He found that not only did Fried Geuter know a great deal about music and musicians, but was able to enlarge upon Michael‚Äôs own knowledge and experience. Fried also told Michael something of his work and its inspiration from Rudolf Steiner. Michael decided to go straight away to join Fried in his effort.‚Äù Fried Geuter‚Äôs vision and intention of establishing a centre for Special Needs education based on Anthroposophy in Birmingham inspired Michael Wilson to start the Sunfield Children's Home for severely disabled children together with him. In 1932 this moved to the village of Clent by Stourbridge, where it continues its work to this day. It was there that 30 years later, in 1962, Michael Wilson and David Clement, both co- workers of Sunfield Homes, offered space and support to Francis Edmunds in founding Emerson College, and together with him, became its first trustees. Michael Wilson continued to lecture at the college many years after it had moved to Forest Row remaining connected with it until his death.\\"The Story of Emerson College: Its Founding Impulse, Work and Form\\" - Michael Spence, Temple Lodge Press, 2013 Page 58 The great outdoors was a lifelong passion for him. He was an experienced mountaineer and active member of the Alpine Society, having scaled many of the highest peaks of Europe. His interest in the elements, particularly the sound and experience of the wind led him to flying gliders. This he learnt from his friend, the pilot Ralph Brocklebank, who later became his colleague at Sunfield Homes. His continued interest in physics and chemistry caused him to experiment mainly in the sphere of optics, being particularly interested in theatre lighting and in the colour theory of Goethe. During his time with the British National Opera, he had designed a new lighting system for their stage. These experiences he carried further in working with the staff and children of Sunfield Children‚Äôs Home in plays, but particularly in developing a specific kind of colour therapy. This experimentation with physics and Goethe‚Äôs colour theory brought him in touch with many of the competent experts and businessmen of the time such as with Kodak, television networks and the developers of the Polaroid camera. He regularly attended the conferences of the Physical Society and wrote books and many articles on the subject of our perception of colour and the phenomenon of coloured shadows. He was a devoted family man with his wife, Betty and their three children, Diana, Robin and Christopher. He translated the central philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner, The Philosophy of Freedom as well as other works.

El Kaliouby's research moved beyond the field's dependence on exaggerated or caricatured expressions modeled by laboratory actors, to focus on the subtle glances found in real situations. She is the co-founder, with Rosalind Picard, and CEO of Affectiva. A pioneer in Artificial Intelligence as well as the co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, an AI startup spun off from the MIT Media Lab. After growing up in Cairo, Egypt, she earned a PhD in Cambridge University, and then joined the MIT Media Lab as a research scientist, where she spearheaded the application of emotion recognition technology in a variety of fields, including mental health and autism. She left MIT to co-found Affectiva, a company credited with defining the field of Emotion AI and now works with 25% of the Fortune 500 and is a leader in emotion AI. Rana was named by Forbes to their list of America's Top 50 Women in Tech, and Fortune included her in their list of 40 under 40 and was chosen by the World Economic Forum to be a Young Global Leader and member of WEF‚Äôs Future Global Council on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. She speaks regularly on ethics in AI and fighting bias in AI at conferences from the Aspen Ideas Festival to the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Future of Everything. She hosted a PBS Nova. Rana el Kaliouby is on a mission to humanize technology with artificial emotional intelligence, or what she calls ‚ÄúEmotion AI.‚Äù through developing a ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù platform that combines facial expression with tone of voice to infer how a person is feeling. She is the author of \\"Girl Decoded: A scientist's quest to reclaim humanity by bringing emotional intelligence to technology\\". Education El Kaliouby earned a Bachelors and Master of Science degree from the American University in Cairo, then a Ph.D at Newnham College, Cambridge. Career El Kaliouby worked as a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helping to found their Autism & Communication Technology Initiative. Her original goal was to improve human-computer interaction, but she quickly became fascinated with the possibility of applying this technology to improve human-human communication, especially for autistic people, many of whom struggle with emotional communication. At the Affective Computing group of MIT Media Lab, she was part of a team that pioneered development of the \\"emotional hearing aid\\", a set of emotion-reading wearable glasses which the New York Times included in their Top 100 innovations of 2006.The Social-Cue Reader, New York Times Magazine December 12, 2006 [note: this article was their writeup on the innovation, but it does not actually make the statement that it got into their top 100. That's probably in some other article which we could do with a citation for. This may involve finding it in a library because it's no longer online. There are plenty of secondary-source statements out there that say this innovation got into their top 100, but it would be nice to be able to cite the list directly.] El Kaliouby demonstrates her work and is interviewed in the 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence Do You Trust This Computer? El Kaliouby has stated that computers, while good with information, fall short when it comes to determining feelings, thus requiring manual prompting to respond to an operator's needs. Her work primarily lies in the subtle facial changes that people tend to make. She has identified 24 landmarks to the face, each moving in different ways, depending on an expressed emotion.Karen Weintraub, \\"Teaching devices to tell a frown from a smile\\", Innovators Under 35, Date not specified. This has many applications, from linguistics to video production. Autism patients, who typically have a different array of expressions that are apart from the norm, may be able to have their moods more easily monitored by parents or caretakers. For production purposes, computer generated imagery of faces (and presumably android projects) will be able to be more realistic in the art of subtlety.

The landslide, which hit early in the morning while residents were asleep, was believed to have been caused by a burst of heavy rainfall, and killed at least (151) people. Rains continued after the landslide making rescue efforts difficult. Cause The landslides were caused after heavy rainfall that had begun the previous day, with the village for receiving the rain on 29 July and the downpour continuing throughout the following day. The environmental destruction that resulted in the landslide is believed to have had many causes. Major cause was negligence of geological facts before any developmental process. Another cause cited as contributing to the landslide was deforestation in the area. Deforestation removes not only trees, but also root structures that hold together the soil. Through deforestation, the soil of the surrounding land was made loose, and experts argue that deforestation was the primary undelaying anthropogenic cause of the landslide. One additional reason was changing agricultural practices villagers had recently shifted from cultivation of rice and finger millet to wheat, which required levelling of steep areas, which contributed to instability of the hills. Also the construction of the nearby Dimbhe Dam ten years ago was considered as a possible reason. The instability of the hillsides was due to the construction activities, which are often done without careful analysis of environmental consequences. Stone quarrying, among other types of construction, was specifically blamed by Sumaira Abdulali of the Awaaz Foundation, for the instability of the hillside. Casualties Although initial reports stated that the landslide had killed 17 people, officials expected the death toll to exceed 150. As of 4 August 2014, the death toll had reached 134. The bodies so far recovered were of 50 men, 64 women and 20 children. Later estimates indicated more than 160 people, and possibly up to 200. About 44 to 46 separate houses were believed to have been buried in the landslide. Management  The landslide was first noticed by a bus driver who drove by the area and saw that the village had been overrun with mud and earth. Emergency services, including 378 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force, were mobilised to the area, and 8 victims had been rescued from the landslide prior to the evening of 30 July. Nevertheless, rescue efforts had been hampered by poor road conditions and continuing rains. Authorities have also expressed pessimism about the possibility of recovering any of the trapped people alive. As of 31 July, 22 people had been rescued alive from the landslide. On 4 August, the survivors of the landslide were ordered by the district administration to move out of Malin. Apart from the Security Forces, members of voluntary organisations and locals also helped in rescue operations. On 7 August, rescue operations officially drew to a close, with the final death toll estimate resting at 151. Reactions * Office of Prime Minister of India released a statement in response to the landslide, in which they \\"condoled the loss of lives in the landslide and directed all possible efforts to help the affected people.\\" * Chief of the Nationalist Congress Party, Sharad Pawar, dubbed the landslide \\"unfortunate\\", and tweeted that \\"We have many villages located beneath hillocks.

The Pakistan army shot and bayoneted 28 Bengali Hindus to death.  Background  On 25 March 1971, the Pakistan army launched Operation Searchlight in East Pakistan. They targeted the Hindus as a community for extermination. After few weeks, they arrived at Faridpur and set up an army base. In the meanwhile, the Hindus of the locality had begun to flee. Around 60 Bengali Hindu families from Faridpur took shelter in Ishangopalpur, a village located six to seven kilometers from the town. The house of erstwhile Hindu landlord Late Ishan Sarkar was located in the village. His grandson Lakshman Sen was staying at the house at that time. After 21 April, NAP leader Chittaranjan Ghosh, his elder brother Jagadish Chandra Ghosh along with a few influential persons from the Bengali Hindu community took shelter in the house. Some of them began to train themselves to fight the Pakistan army.  Killings  On 2 May, the local collaborators led a contingent of the Pakistani army towards the village. They parked their vehicle at the Lakshmi Daser Hat and proceeded to the house of Ishan Sarkar. As the residents attempted to flee, they were caught at gunpoint. 29 inmates of the house were rounded up and led them to the banks of a small water body nearby. They were kicked, punched and bayoneted. Then the male members were killed one by one in front of their wives and children. Before leaving the place, the Pakistan army warned in Urdu that no freedom fighter or Hindus would be spared. One person survived after escaping with a bullet wound. The dead were buried beside the pond.  Aftermath  After the independence of Bangladesh, the mass killing site remained as it is. In 2010, the family members of the victims erected a memorial at the mass killing site. On 2 May, the victims were commemorated and verses from the Gita were recited for the peace of the departed souls.

For example, in some models, Americans can expect to earn more American dollars on average by investing in Euros, while Europeans can expect to earn more Euros on average by investing in American dollars. The paradox was identified by economist Jeremy Siegel in 1972. Like the related two envelopes problem, the phenomenon is sometimes labeled a paradox because an agent can seem to trade for something of equal monetary value and yet, paradoxically, seem at the same time to gain monetary value from the trade. Closer analysis shows that the \\"monetary value\\" of the trade is ambiguous but that nevertheless such trades are often favorable, depending on the scenario.  Apple/orange example  Economist Fischer Black gave the following illustration in 1995. Suppose that the exchange rate between an \\"apple\\" country where consumers prefer apples, and an \\"orange\\" country where consumers prefer valuable oranges, is currently 1:1, but will change next year to 2:1 or 1:2 with equal probability. Suppose an apple consumer trades an apple to an orange consumer in exchange for an orange. The apple consumer now has given up an apple for an orange, which next year has an expected value of 1.25 apples. The orange consumer now has given up an orange for an apple, which next year has an expected value of 1.25 oranges. Thus both appear to have benefited from the exchange on average. Mathematically, the apparent surplus is related to Jensen's inequality.Beenstock, Michael. \\"Forward Exchange Rates and Siegel's Paradox .Oxford Economic Papers 37.2 (1985): 298-303.  Wine example  A more detailed example is a simplified efficient market with two wines, an American wine and a German wine. In November the wines trade 1:1. In December, most consumers will put exactly twice as much value on the trendier wine than the non-trendy wine; there is a 50/50 chance that either wine will become the trendy one in December. Thus, the wines are equally likely to trade 1:2 or 2:1 in December. Most consumers care about the nationality only insofar as it influences which wine is trendy. The only exceptions are a single loyalist American consumer, who only drinks American wine and is indifferent to trendiness, and a single loyalist German consumer, whose only drinks German wine and is likewise indifferent to trendiness. The American loyalist counter-intuitively prefers to hold a German rather than an American wine in November, as it has a 50% chance of being tradeable for 0.5 American wines, and a 50% chance of being tradeable for 2 American wines, and thus has an expected value of 1.25 American wines. (All the consumers in this scenario are risk-neutral). Similarly, the German, if she holds an American wine, can be considered to be in possession of an expected value of 1.25 German wines. In this case, the gains from Siegel's paradox are real, and each loyalist gains utility on average by temporarily trading away from their preferred consumption good, due to the large utility gain should they succeed in the gambit of saving up in hopes of buying multiple bottles of the preferred wine should the price plummet in December. Analyzing the case of the trendy consumers, who are indifferent to the nationality apart from its trendiness, is more complex. Such a consumer, if in possession of American wine, might fallaciously reason: \\"I currently have 1 American wine. If I trade for a German wine, I will have an expected value of 1.25 American wines. Therefore, I will be better off on average if I adopt a strategy to temporarily trade away, as the American loyalist did.\\" However, this is similar to the \\"two envelopes problem\\", and the gains from Siegel's paradox in this case are illusory. The trendy consumer who uses the American loyalist's strategy is left with a 50% chance of 0.5 bottles of a newly popular trendy American wine, and a 50% chance of 2 bottles of a newly unpopular non-trendy American wine; to the trendy consumer this is not a material improvement over having a 50% chance of a bottle of trendy American wine and a 50% chance of having a bottle of non-trendy American wine. Thus, the trendy consumer has merely broken even, on average. Similarly, the trendy consumer also would not gain utility from adopting the German loyalist's strategy.Edlin, Aaron S. \\"Forward Discount Bias, Nalebuff's Envelope Puzzle, and the Siegel Paradox in Foreign Exchange.\\" Topics in Theoretical Economics 2.1 (2002).  Applications  While the wine and the apples are toy examples, the paradox has a real- world application to what currencies investors should choose to hold. Fischer Black concluded from analyses similar to the apple/orange example that when investing overseas, investors should not seek to hedge all their currency risk. Other researchers consider such an analysis simplistic. In many circumstances, Siegel's paradox should indeed drive a rational investor to become more willing to embrace modest currency risk. In many other circumstances, they should not; for example, if the exchange rate uncertainty is due to differing rates of inflation with the imposition of purchasing power parity, then something like the \\"two envelopes\\" analysis applies, and there may be no particular reason to embrace currency risk.  Geometric mean and reciprocity functions  A different approach to Siegel's paradox is proposed by K. Mallahi-Karai and P. Safari , where they show that the only possible way to avoid making risk-less money in such future-based currency exchanges is to settle on the (weighted) geometric mean of the future exchange rates, or more generally a product of the weighted geometric mean and a so-called reciprocity function. The weights of the geometric mean depend on the probability of the rates occurring in the future, while the reciprocity function can always be taken to be the unit function. What this implies, for instance, in the case of apple/orange example above, is that the consumers should trade their products for ‚àö(2)(1/2)=1 units of the other product to avoid an arbitrage. This method will provide currency traders on both sides with a common exchange rate they can safely agree on.

Life Born at Nottingham, of Scottish Highland background, he was son of an employee at the William Gibson & Sons hosiery manufactory there. He was brought up near Sherwood Forest, and unwillingly apprenticed against his will to his father's business. An interest in drawing was encouraged by Thomas Bailey who allowed him to copy pictures in his collection. On his 21st birthday McCallum left home, and maintained himself by teaching. Aged 22 twenty-two he became a student in the recently founded Government School of Art at Nottingham. He exhibited a view of Flint Castle at the British Institution in London in 1849. About this time he became a student at the Government School of Design at Somerset House, where J. R. Herbert, Richard Redgrave, and John Callcott Horsley were among his instructors. In 1850 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy. From that year till 1852 he was assistant master at the Manchester School of Art, and from 1852 to 1854 he was headmaster of the School of Art at Stourbridge, after the brief tenure from 1851 of Henry Alexander Bowler. There he resided at the Old Parsonage, New Street. In 1854 MacCallum went to Italy with a travelling studentship awarded by the Science and Art Department. Part of his time was spent on mural decorations; returning to England in 1857, he decorated the western exterior of the Sheepshanks Gallery at the South Kensington Museum with panels of sgraffito. He then concentrated on landscape, with subjects at Burnham Beeches and in Windsor Forest. Among patrons were John Phillip and James Nasmyth, and he was awarded a silver medal by the Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts. Towards the end of 1861 MacCallum painted at Fontainebleau; in 1864 he worked in Switzerland and on the River Rhine; in 1866 he was in Italy; in the winter of 1866‚Äì7 he was in the neighbourhood of Paris. Between 1870 and 1875 he paid several visits to Egypt where he made many sketches of rural life.Khatib, H., Palestine and Egypt Under the Ottomans: Paintings, Books, Photographs, Maps and Manuscripts, I.B.Tauris, 2003, p. 114 He was \\"the Painter\\" who accompanied Amelia Edwards in 1873- 1874 on her Dahabiya in her best selling book \\"A Thousand Miles Up the Nile\\". About 1875 he was commissioned by Queen Victoria to paint five views near Balmoral. He sometimes lectured on art subjects. MacCallum died on 22 January 1902 at 5 The Studios, Holland Park Road, Kensington, London. He had lived in the neighbourhood since 1858 when he leased from Thomas Webster his house in The Mall, Kensington. Works Andrew MacCallum, View of Marathon (1874) MacCallum's reputation rested mainly on woodland subjects. He sent 53 pictures to the Royal Academy (1850‚Äì1886) and others to the British Institution, Society of British Artists, and International Exhibitions (1870‚Äì1). Special exhibitions of his paintings were held at the Dudley Gallery in 1866 and at Nottingham in 1873; his Sultry Eve was shown at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876. He used water-colour, and drew in pastel and in gold, silver, and copper point. The Major Oak, Sherwood Forest (1882), by Andrew MacCallum The Tate Gallery acquired MacCallum's Silvery Moments, Burnham Beeches (1885), and The Monarch of the Glen; the Victoria and Albert Museum his In Sherwood Forest‚ÄîWinter Evening after Rain (1881), S. Maria delle Grazie, Milan (1854), Rome from the Porta San Pancrazio (1855‚Äì6), The Burning of Rome by Nero, and the Massacre of the Christians (1878‚Äì9), and Head of Christ after Daniele Crespi. The City of Nottingham Art Gallery bought The Major Oak, Sherwood Forest (1882), measuring about 9 ft. by 12 ft., and The Opening Scene in Bailey's \\"Festus\\". Family MacCallum was twice married: (1) to Miss Tetlow (d. c. 1875) of Altrincham, of independent means; and (2) to Miss Salway of Ludlow, by whom he had two sons, who both served in the Second Boer War.

Born in Prussia, Peltzer immigrated with his family when he was a child and came alone to Chicago, Illinois in 1850. There, he rose through the ranks of the department of public works, eventually becoming deputy recorder of Chicago. He served one term in the Illinois House of Representatives. In his free time, Peltzer translated and wrote works of stage. Biography Otto Peltzer was born on November 29, 1836, in Stolberg, Prussia. In 1849, his family immigrated to the United States and established a farm in Wisconsin. When Peltzer was thirteen, he moved to Chicago, Illinois and took a position in the Chicago recorder's office. In 1857, he decided to pursue a career in law, but abandoned the efforts three years later. Peltzer then became chief draughtsman of the board of public works, where he supervised the dock surveys of the Chicago River and compiled the city atlases. In 1869, he was elected collector of taxes of northern Chicago. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed all records of the city and county, so Peltzer quickly published the Atlas of Chicago, organized from his personal collection. In 1872, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Liberal Republican, where he served one two-year term. He introduced bills for compulsory education, for a state board of health, and for licensing for surveyors, physicians, and pharmacists. He returned to the board of public works after his term, then was named deputy recorder in December 1876. In April 1878, he resigned and opened a title and abstract office as Otto Peltzer & Co. In his free time, Peltzer enjoyed writing, particularly for stage works. In 1868, he translated the \\"Masons' Lord's Prayer\\" into English, which became a popular recital at Freemasonry meetings. He translated Karl Gutzkow's Uriel Acosta, a tragedy about the life of Uriel da Costa, which played for several weeks at Crosby's Opera House. Florenz Ziegfeld, Sr., who ran the Chicago Musical College, produced one of his dramatic ballads. One of his dramas of domestic life was performed at McVicker's Theater. In 1887, he founded The Moralist and the Theatre periodical. Peltzer married Annie Langden in 1861. They had four children, one son and three daughters: Oscar E., Lottie, Lauea, and Louise.

It was Ser√∫ Gir√°n's last album until the 1992 reunion. The group released three successful singles from the album: \\"Peperina\\", \\"Cinema Verit√©\\", \\"Esperando nacer\\" and \\"Salir de la melancol√≠a\\".  Overview  Peperina was recorded in early 1981, mainly at the ION Studios and then, some tracks at Wacameca Studios. The title-song is about a journalist writing from Expreso Imaginario magazine, called Patricia Perea, who rated the Ser√∫ Gir√°n shows in Cordoba, as \\"boring\\". Charly Garc√≠a wrote the song as a response to her attack on the band. The record has featured in numerous publications' lists of the best albums of the Argentine Rock. Many consider Peperina to be the band's finest album, due to the sound quality. By 1981, the band had achieved considerable commercial success in Argentina, including several hits, so it made sense to present the album at the Estadio Obras, on September 4, 5 and 6 of that same year.

Query rewriting can be based on relational algebra or an extension thereof (e.g. multiset relational algebra with sorting, aggregation and three-valued predicates i.e. NULLs as in the case of SQL). The equivalence rules of relational algebra are exploited, in other words, different query structures and orderings can be mathematically proven to yield the same result. For example, filtering on fields A and B, or cross joining R and S can be done in any order, but there can be a performance difference. Multiple operations may be combined, and operation orders may be altered. The result of query rewriting may not be at the same abstraction level or application programming interface (API) as the original set of queries (though often is). For example, the input queries may be in relational algebra or SQL, and the rewritten queries may be closer to the physical representation of the data, e.g. array operations. Query rewriting can also involve materialization of views and other subqueries; operations that may or may not be available to the API user. The query rewriting transformation can be aided by creating indices from which the optimizer can choose (some database systems create their own indexes if deemed useful), mandating the use of specific indices, creating materialized and/or denormalized views, or helping a database system gather statistics on the data and query use, as the optimality depends on patterns in data and typical query usage. Query rewriting may be rule based or optimizer based. Some sources discuss query rewriting as a distinct step prior to optimization, operating at the level of the user accessible algebra API (e.g. SQL). There are other, largely unrelated concepts also named similarly, for example, query rewriting by search engines.

After three years, Capps moved to military intelligence work in Korea, serving as a US liaison to the Korean Defense Intelligence Agency and later in the 5/17th Cavalry squadron of the Second Infantry Division. Capps returned to the United States and trained at Camp Peary as an Army case officer, and earned a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts from Johns Hopkins University. In 1994, Capps transferred to the Army Reserve and joined the State Department as a Foreign Service Officer. From 1996 to 2002, he served in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Kosovo, and Rwanda as a Foreign Service officer. Additionally during those six years, Capps was deployed as an intelligence officer in Uganda and Zaire by the army. After the September 11 attacks, Capps served with XVIII Airborne Corps and the Defense intelligence Agency in Afghanistan as a soldier. Later, he was deployed to Darfur and Chad as a soldier, and Iraq and Darfur as a Foreign Service officer. Throughout his career of service, Capps was often working in close proximity to murder, rape, and genocide. He suffered from regular and intense nightmares; he was diagnosed by an Army psychiatrist with PTSD and depression, and prescribed Prozac. In 2006, he nearly committed suicide. He was medically evacuated from service by the Regional Medical Officer of the State Department. After deployment After his medevac, Capps returned to the State Department as an expert on Darfur and Chad. He retired from government work and began pursuing a Master of Arts in Writing from Johns Hopkins University in 2009. Three years later, he founded the Veterans Writing Project. The non-profit organization hosts free writing workshops and seminars for veterans and service members, as well as their adult family members. Capps often writes freelance articles about PTSD. His work has been published in Time Magazine, NPR, and the New York Times, among others. He published his first book, Seriously Not All Right: Five Wars in Ten Years in 2014. It outlines his experiences with PTSD and his service during wars in Central Africa, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Darfur. Awards and recognition Capps has had three essays listed as notable in Best American Essays: in 2012, 2014, and 2015. His essay Writing My Way Home received special recognition in the 2015 Pushcart Prizes. His essay The French Lieutenant's iPod, was selected (by Bill Rorbach) as first prize winner in Press 53's Annual Awards for 2011. In April 2017, Capps and the non- profit he founded, the Veterans Writing Project, received the Anne Smedinghoff Award from the Johns Hopkins University Foreign Affairs Symposium. In 2007, Capps received the American Foreign Service Association's William R. Rivkin award for \\"intellectual courage and the creative use of dissent in foreign policy.‚Äù The award was presented in recognition of a State Department cable Capps wrote while serving as a political officer at Embassy Khartoum that questioned U.S. government policy in Darfur. The cable, titled \\"Darfur: Who Will Apologize,\\" was classified as confidential, but was nonetheless leaked to blogger Eric Reeves who included parts of it in a long blog post. Capps provided a copy of a draft version of the cable to researcher Rebecca Hamilton who mentioned it in her book, Fighting for Darfur: Public Action and the Struggle to Stop Genocide.

Via the bloodstream the drug is transported to the liver and immediately metabolized to paracetamol and ultimately to 13CO2 (Fig. 1), which is in turn transported via the bloodstream to the lung and exhaled. Cytochrome P450 1A2 is evenly distributed over all the cells of a liver acinus,C. N. Palmer, P. J. Coates, S. E. Davies, et al. Localization of cytochrome P-450 gene expression in normal and diseased human liver by in situ hybridization of wax-embedded archival material. Hepatology 1992;16(3):682-7 and is in contrast to other members of the cytochrome P450 family exclusively expressed in the liver. Cytochrome P450 A2 is usually not inducible by clinically frequently used drugs making it ideal even in complex clinical situations (exceptions are oral contraceptives resulting in a strong induction of P450 A2). Nutrition and lifestyle can strongly influence P450 A2 induction e.g. smoking or coffee consumption.Tantcheva-Poor, I. and Zaigler, M. and Rietbrock, S. and Fuhr, U. Estimation of cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 activity in 863 healthy Caucasians using a saliva-based caffeine test. Pharmacogenetics 1999 The test substance 13C methacetin itself is considered as is non-toxic and very well tolerated in the used dosage.G. A. Starmer, S. McLean, J. Thomas. Analgesic potency and acute toxicity of substituted anilides and benzamides. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 1971;19(1):20-8 Similarly, 13C is a stable, naturally occurring and non-radioactive carbon isotope. For this reason, patients need to fast for at least three hours before measurement to remove potential interferences with carbon from the food.  Test procedure  The test is started with placing a breathing mask on the patient's face, separating the inhaled from the exhaled air by two valves. Consequently, the ratio of the 13CO2/12CO2 is determined in the exhaled air over a period of 10 to 20 minutes to measure the individual baseline of each patient (Fig. 2).Figure 2: Individual liver function can be assessed by continuous measurement of 13CO2/12CO2-Ratio after injection und metabolism of 13C-methacetin After intravenous injection of 13C-methacetin the ratio of 13CO2/12CO2 increases subsequently and is quantified by a special device continuously and realtime at the bedside (FLIPFLIP). Since the device is detecting the carbon dioxide ratio chronic lung diseases (e.g. COPD, fibrosis) do not influence test results. The turnover of 13C-methacetin can be continuously determined using kinetic analysis. The LiMAx (maximum liver function capacity) is defined as the maximum value of the substrate conversion normalized to body weight.  Clinical application  The LiMAx test was developed at Charit√© University Hospital Berlin and is deployed in German, Austrian and Swiss university hospitals gaining widespread use in hepatology and liver surgery.M.

During the 1970s and 1980s, guest performers in dramatic specials and regular performers on children's series competed in the same category. However, starting in 1989, separate categories for performances in children's series and performances in children's specials were created and used until after 2007 when all categories related to Children's Specials were dropped. The youngest Emmy nominee, Jodelle Ferland, was nominated in this category in 2001 at the age of six. The youngest Emmy winner, Bindi Irwin, won the award in 2008 at the age of nine.

They are an important source for historians as they provide far more information than other charters of the period, showing the date and place of the grant, and having an unusually long list of witnesses, including Welsh kings and occasionally kings of Scotland and Strathclyde. The √Üthelstan A charters commence shortly after King √Üthelstan conquered Northumbria in 927, making him the first king to rule the whole of England. The diplomas give the king titles such as \\"King of the English\\" and \\"King of the Whole of Britain\\", and this is seen by historians as part of a rhetoric which reflected his master's claim for a new status, higher than previous West Saxon kings. The diplomas are written in elaborate Latin known as the hermeneutic style, which became dominant in Anglo-Latin literature from the mid-tenth century and a hallmark of the English Benedictine Reform. Scholars vary widely in their views of his style, which has been described as \\"pretentious\\" and \\"almost impenetrable\\", but also as \\"poetic\\" and \\"as enduringly fascinating as it is complex\\". √Üthelstan A ceased to draft charters after 935, and his successors returned to a simpler style, suggesting that he was working on his own rather than being a member of a royal scriptorium. Background After the death of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and charters were produced, and they were of poor quality. King √Üthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871‚Äì899), embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899‚Äì924), and none from 909 to 925. Until then, charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King √Üthelstan's early diplomas were similar. Until about 900, diplomas appear to have been drawn up in varying traditions and circumstances, but in later Anglo-Saxon times (c. 900‚Äì1066) charters can be more clearly defined. According to Simon Keynes: > In this period, a diploma can be characterised as a formal and symbolic > record, in Latin, of an occasion when the king, acting in a royal assembly, > and with the consent of the ecclesiastical and secular orders, created an > estate of \\"bookland\\" at a specified place, and conveyed it on the privileged > terms defined by the \\"book\\", or diploma, to a named beneficiary. This act of > establishing a particular estate as bookland, so that it could be held > henceforth on these privileged terms, could be performed only by the king, > in a royal assembly; but the diploma itself served hereafter as the title- > deed for the land in question. It established that the land was to be held, > with its appurtenances, free from the imposition of worldly burdens, with > the exception of military service, bridge-work and fortress-work, and with > the power to give it to anyone of its owner's choosing. Identity of √Üthelstan A In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a debate among historians as to whether late Anglo-Saxon charters were produced by a royal chancery or by monasteries on behalf of beneficiaries. In the 1910s, W. H. Stevenson argued that charters in different areas of England were drawn up by the same hand, which would be unlikely if they were drawn up locally, supporting the case that the writers were royal clerks. The German scholar Richard Dr√∂gereit followed this up in 1935 by examining original charters between 931 and 963, and identified three scribes from their handwriting, whom he called √Üthelstan A, √Üthelstan C and Edmund C. Other charters which only existed in copies he allocated to these and other scribes on the basis of their style. In 2002 Keynes listed twenty \\"√Üthelstan A\\" charters, of which two are original and the rest copies. The boundary clauses of the √Üthelstan A charters were written in correct Old English, so it is unlikely that he was of foreign origin. The witness lists of the √Üthelstan A charters consistently place Bishop √Ülfwine of Lichfield in Mercia in a higher position than his rank warranted. King √Üthelstan was probably brought up in Mercia, and in Sarah Foot's view he was probably intimate with √Ülfwine before King Edward's death; as √Ülfwine disappeared from the witness lists at the same time as the √Üthelstan A charters ended, she suggests that he may have been √Üthelstan A. Keynes thinks it more likely √Üthelstan A was a king's priest from Mercia, who acquired his learning in a Mercian religious house and respected √Ülfwine as a fellow Mercian; that √Üthelstan A entered √Üthelstan's service before he became king and was in permanent attendance on him. David Woodman also considers a Mercian origin likely, pointing out that some Mercian ninth-century charters have borrowings from Aldhelm, an important source of √Üthelstan A's style. Woodman also puts forward the alternative idea that √Üthelstan A had a connection with Glastonbury Abbey in Wessex, which appears to have been a centre of learning at this time, and certainly housed many of the texts which informed √Üthelstan A's idiosyncratic Latin style. Significance of the charters St Cuthbert. Illustration in a gospel book presented by √Üthelstan to the saint's shrine in Chester-le-Street, the earliest surviving portrait of an English king. The first charter produced by √Üthelstan A in 928 described the king as rex Anglorum, \\"king of the English\\", the first time that title had been used. By 931 he had become \\"king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain\\". Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings, and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde, signifying acceptance of √Üthelstan's lordship. In Keynes's view, it cannot be a coincidence that the charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria, and √Üthelstan A's primary aim was to display the \\"grandeur of √Üthelstan's kingship\\". Foot argues that the king's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for \\"ideological aggrandizement of the king's public standing\\". To Keynes, the diplomas \\"are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success, developing the pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in the trappings of a new political order.\\" He sees the fifty years from 925 to 975 as \\"the golden age of the Anglo-Saxon royal diploma\\". Before 928 charters had been produced in various ways, sometimes by royal priests, sometimes by other priests on behalf of the beneficiaries. √Üthelstan A was solely responsible for the production of charters between 928 and 934. King √Üthelstan thus took unprecedented control over an important part of his functions. In 935 √Üthelstan A shared the work with other scribes, and he then apparently retired. His charters have exceptionally long witness lists, with 101 names for a grant by the king to his thegn Wulfgar at Lifton in Devon in 931, and 92 for a grant to √Ülfgar at Winchester in 934. The witness lists of King √Üthelstan's father and grandfather were much shorter, with the longest in Alfred the Great's reign having only 19 names. In John Maddicott's view the long lists in √Üthelstan's reign reflect a change of direction to larger assemblies. The king established a novel system, with his scribe travelling with him from meeting to meeting, and a uniform format of charters. The dating clause showed the regnal year, the indiction, the epact, and the age of the moon. In Keynes's view: \\"Nothing quite like them had been seen before; and they must have seemed magnificent, even intimidating, in their formality and their grandeur.\\" A unique feature is that three charters in favour of a religious community require it to sing a specified number of psalms for the king, indicating a particular interest in psalmody by the king or scribe. Frankish annalists usually recorded a king's location at Easter and Christmas, but this was not a practice of English chroniclers, and the only period in the tenth and eleventh centuries for which historians can construct a partial itinerary of the king's movements is provided by the location of assemblies recorded in √Üthelstan A's charters of 928 to 935. Other charters rarely named the place of assembly, apart from a group in the 940s and early 950s known as the \\"alliterative\\" charters. In 935 a new simplified format was introduced by other scribes, apparently while √Üthelstan A was still active, and became the standard until the late 950s. This coincided with the disappearance of Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York from the witness lists, and greater prominence of the Bishops of London and Bishop of Winchester, and the new format may have reflected a change of outlook at court. As charters were no longer written in his distinctive style when he ceased producing them, it is likely he was working on his own rather than heading a royal scriptorium. Style of the charters The standard of Latin prose improved in the tenth century, especially after about 960, when the leaders of the Benedictine reform movement adopted the elaborate and ornate style of Latin now called by historians the hermeneutic style. Use of this style, influenced especially by Aldhelm's De virginitate, dates back to King √Üthelstan's reign. √Üthelstan A borrowed heavily from Aldhelm; he would not copy whole sentences, only a word or a few words, incorporating them in a structure reminiscent of Aldhelm's works. In Woodman's view, \\"√Üthelstan A\\" varied the language in each charter out of a delight in experimentation and to demonstrate his literary ability. The florid style of seventh-century Irish texts known as Hiberno-Latin was influential on the Continent due to the work of Irish missionaries in Europe. Some works were known to English writers such as Aldhelm in the same century, but it is likely that √Üthelstan A learnt of them from continental scholars such as Israel the Grammarian, who brought texts influenced by Hiberno-Latin to King √Üthelstan's court. Woodman states that: \\"whilst it is true that the main impetus for the literary revival of Latin prose occurred from the mid-tenth century, the beginnings of this style of Latin can actually be found rather earlier and in the most unlikely of places. In fact it is diplomas of the 920s and 930s that are the first to display this distinctive Latin in its most exuberant form.\\" According to Scott Thompson Smith √Üthelstan A's diplomas \\"are generally characterised by a rich pleonastic style with aggressively literary proems and anathemas, ostentatious language and imagery throughout, decorative rhetorical figures, elaborate dating clauses, and extensive witness lists. These are clearly documents with stylistic ambitions.\\" Few listeners would have understood them when they were read out at royal assemblies. In Charter S 425 of 934, the second of the two originals to survive, √Üthelstan A wrote (in Smith's translation): > The wanton fortune of the deceiving world, not lovely with the milky-white > radiance of unfading lilies but odious with the galling bitterness of woeful > corruption, raging with venomous jaws tears with its teeth the sons of fetid > flesh in the vale of tears; although with its smiles it may be alluring to > the unfortunate, it brazenly leads down to the lowest depths of Acherontic > Cocytus unless the offspring of the High-Thunderer should intervene. And so > because that ruinous [fortune] mortally fades away in its failing, one must > especially hasten to pleasant fields of ineffable joy where the angelic > music of hymnal jubilation and the mellifluous scent of blooming roses are > sensed as sweet beyond measure by good and blessed noses and heard by ears > as the delights of musical instrument without end. In S 416 of 931, the first original to survive, after the boundary clause in Old English, he reverted to Latin for the anathema against anyone who set aside the charter: > If, however, God forbid, anyone swollen with diabolic spirit should be > tempted to diminish or annul this brief document of my arrangement and > confirmation, let him know that on the final and great day of judgment, when > the archangel's shrill trumpet rings out, when graves burst open by > themselves and give up the bodies now revived, when every element trembles, > with the traitor Judas, who is called \\"son of perdition\\" by the Sower's > merciful Offspring, he is to perish in eternal confusion within the hungry > flames of unspeakable torments. Some scholars are not impressed. Michael Lapidge describes √Üthelstan A's style as \\"pretentious\\", and according to Mechtild Gretsch the diplomas > are composed in almost impenetrable Latin. Their proems consist of long > convoluted sentences, parading an ostentatious display of Greek and > glossary-based vocabulary and containing numerous unmistakable verbal > reminiscences of Aldhelm's writings. Nothing similar had previously been > attempted in Anglo-Saxon diplomatic and although, later in the tenth > century, other charters affecting the hermeneutic style were composed, the > ferocious lexical and syntactical difficulties of these √Üthelstan charters > were never to be surpassed. On the other hand, Dr√∂gereit describes √Üthelstan A's style as having a \\"poetic quality\\", and Woodman describes him as an \\"author of no little genius, a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex.\\" In Woodman's view: \\"Never before had the royal diploma's rhetorical properties been exploited to such a degree and it seems no coincidence that these documents appeared following King √Üthelstan's momentous political conquest of the north in 927.\\" List of charters Keynes listed the √Üthelstan A charters in Table XXVII of his Atlas of Attestations. The charters are in the script called \\"Square minuscule ('Phase II')\\", with a Latin text and the boundary clause in the vernacular. =Charters= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:98%\\" !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"110\\"  Date !scope=\\"col\\"  Sawyer number !scope=\\"col\\"  Place of issue !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Subject !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Comments - ! scope=\\"row\\" 16 April 928 S 400Exeter\\"King √Üthelstan to Byrhtferth, minister; grant of 12 hides (mansiones) at Odstock, Wilts\\"S 400 - ! scope=\\"row\\" 16 April 928 S 399Exeter\\"King √Üthelstan to √Ülffl√¶d; grant of 20 hides (mansiones) at Winterburna\\"S 399 - ! scope=\\"row\\" 3 April 930 S 403Lyminster\\"King √Üthelstan to Beornheah, Bishop of Selsey; grant of 4 hides (cassatae) at Medmerry, with woodland at Earnley and meadow outside Chichester\\"S 403Bishop required to sing psalms for the king. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 29 April 930 S 405Chippenham\\"King √Üthelstan to Eadulf, bishop and the familia at Crediton; grant of 3 hides (cassatae) at Sandford near Crediton\\"S 405 - ! scope=\\"row\\" 23 March 931 S 412Colchester\\"King √Üthelstan to √Ülfric, abbot; grant of 10 hides (cassatae) √¶t Clere (Ecchinswell, Hants)\\"S 412 - ! scope=\\"row\\" 20 June 931 S 413Kings Worthy\\"King √Üthelstan to √Ülfric, minister; grant of 20 hides (cassati) at Watchfield, Berks\\"S 413 - ! scope=\\"row\\" 15 July 931 S 1604East Wellow\\"King √Üthelstan to ?; grant of land at Bultheswrthe\\"S 1604  Survives in abbreviated form. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 12 November 931 S 416Lifton\\"King √Üthelstan to Wulfgar, minister; grant of 9 hides (cassatae) at Ham, Wilts\\"S 416Original charter in √Üthelstan A's hand. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 30 August 932 S 417Milton ?Kent\\"King √Üthelstan to √Üthelgeard (or √Üthelweard), minister; grant of 12 hides (cassatae) at (West) Meon, Hants\\"S 417Milton Regis, Kent or Milton Abbas, Dorset. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 9 November 932 S 418aExeter\\"King √Üthelstan to Beorhtsige, abbot; grant of 10 hides (cassatae) at Bowers Gifford, Essex\\"S 418a - ! scope=\\"row\\" 24 December 932 S 418Amesbury\\"King √Üthelstan to Alfred, minister; grant of 12 hides (cassatae) at North Stoneham, Hants\\"S 418 Beneficiary to provide for 120 destitute daily. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 24 December 932 S 419Amesbury\\"King √Üthelstan to Shaftesbury Abbey; grant of 11.5 hides (cassatae) at Fontmell, Dorset\\"S 419Nuns asked to sing fifty psalms and say mass for the king every day. - ! scope=\\"row\\" 11 January 933 S 379Wilton\\"King Edward (sic) to Wulfgar, minister; grant of 10 hides (cassatae) at Collingbourne Kingston, Wilts\\"S 379 Copy of charter of 933 with the date altered to 921 and king to Edward.

Sprague de Camp. It was first published in the magazine Astounding Science-Fiction for August, 1939.Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 133. It first appeared in book form in the anthology Adventures in Time and Space (Random House, 1946); it later appeared in the anthologies World of Wonder (Twayne, 1951), The Science Fiction Bestiary (Thomas Nelson, 1971), Androids, Time Machines and Blue Giraffes (Follett, 1973), Isaac Asimov Presents the Great Science Fiction Stories: Volume 1, 1939 (DAW Books, 1979), Isaac Asimov Presents The Golden Years of Science Fiction (Bonanza Books, 1983), and An Anthropomorphic Century (FurPlanet Productions, 2015). The story has been translated into Italian, French and German. Plot summary Athelstan Cuff, an English immigrant to America, finds his son, Peter, distraught on having learned he is adopted. He reassures the boy that it makes no difference, and at Peter's urging explains why he never had natural children. In 1976, before coming to America, Cuff is a park official in southern Africa. He is called to a wildlife preserve in the Okavango River Delta by George Mtengeni, the local warden, to investigate the sighting of a strange blue giraffe. Once on the scene, he learns that the mystery extends far deeper. Together, with Mtengeni, he observes not just the animal in question but another giraffe with a goat-like beard, only six feet long, a green hippopotamus with pink spots, and a two-headed rhinoceros. Other creatures are so mutated their very survival is threatened, and Mtengeni is concerned about the long-term prospects of the animal population. Establishing camp in the bush, the two are separated when the warden goes out into the night for firewood and Cuff, hearing what he takes for a native woman's scream from another direction, heads off to investigate. He finds the woman, treed by a buffalo, and rescues her, only to realize he has now lost his way and cannot relocate the camp. The woman, Ingwamza, undertakes to lead him back to her village. When daylight comes and Cuff can finally see her clearly, he discovers Ingwamza too is a mutation; despite her generally human proportions, she has greenish-yellow hair, a short tail, and the head of a baboon. Startled, he accidentally shoots himself in the foot. Now dependent on Ingwamza for survival Cuff allows her to lead him onward despite his horror. They soon arrive at the village of the Fene Abantu, or baboon people. There, Cuff is introduced to their chief, Ingwamza's father Indlovu. The chief explains what he knows about himself and his people. He was the first of their race; the others of the tribe are all his descendants. His first memories are of the black man who taught him to speak, Stanley H. Mqhavi, who worked for \\"the machine man\\", a white man named Heeky. Heeky was called the machine man for some sort of device he had built and operated at the edge of the Chobe Swamp. When Heeky died, Mqhavi tried leading Indlovu and his progeny back towards civilization, but became lost in the delta and died after admonishing his charges never to go near the machine. The Fene Abantu have lived in the delta ever since. Cuff realizes \\"Heeky\\" must have been Hickey, a scientist known to have disappeared in the region back in the 1940s. He deduces Hickey must have been experimenting on the animals with radiation, and his device, never deactivated, has continued to affect the germ plasm of any who wander near it, until their altered descendants have finally attracted outside notice. Simultaneously, Cuff learns he has a personal problem. Not only is he trapped in the baboon people's village until he recovers, but Indlovu has decided to honor him by marrying him to Ingwamza. His succor comes in the form of Cukata, Ingwamza's former lover, who sneaks into Cuff's hut by night intending to kill his rival. Convincing Cukata he has no wish to come between them, Cuff persuades the creature to help him escape instead. Accordingly, Cukata spirits Cuff out and provides him transportation in the form of Soga, one of a herd of mutated crocodiles the tribe retains as mounts. He also tells him where he can find Hickey's machine. On the back of Soga, Cuff succeeds in reaching Hickey's old headquarters and turning off his machine. The creatures of the region are now safe from further mutation. But Cuff himself is still in danger from the pursuing Fene Abantu, led by the offended Indlovu. Facing imminent recapture, he is rescued at the last moment by Mtengeni, who has also been searching for him. Under the protection of Mtengeni's rifle, Cuff resolves his differences with Indlovu. Later, however, Cuff realizes that in approaching and deactivating Hickey's device, he himself must have gotten a full dose of radiation, damaging his own germ plasm. Hence he can never risk having children for fear of producing monsters, and that, as he will ultimately tell his son Peter, is why he chose to adopt him. Reception In the analysis of science fiction historians Alexei and Cory Panshin, the story typified an attitude of de Camp remarkable for the genre of the time: \\"In the proto-ecological universe projected by de Camp, to be human ... was a natural state of being which we might share with a wide variety of creatures. ... [D]e Camp was capable of imagining what previously would have been thought of as lesser beings‚Äì[such as] a tribe of mutated baboons in 'The Blue Giraffe' (Astounding, Aug 1939) ... as being as decent, rational and civilized as most men manage to be, and maybe even more so.\\"Panshin, Alexei and Cory. The World Beyond the Hill: Science Fiction and the Quest for Transcendence. Los Angeles, Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc., 1989, page 291. Jamie Todd Rubin, reviewing the issue of Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes \\"[o]f all the stories in the issue, de Camp‚Äôs is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that you feel like you are right there with the characters on their journey. Abou[t] the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn‚Äôt think the ending lived up to the full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and just go on the wonderful journey through the African wilderness.\\"Rubin, Jamie Todd. \\"Vacation in the Golden Age, Episode 2: Astounding Science Fiction August 1939,\\" posted on January 30, 2011 Relation to other works Other uses of intelligent non-human primates by de Camp can be found in his earlier short story \\"Living Fossil\\" (1939) and later novel Genus Homo (1950), written in collaboration with P. Schuyler Miller. Another instance of his use of a \\"lower\\" species raised to intelligence by scientific means can be found in his later novella The Virgin of Zesh (1953). De Camp reuses the plot feature of the protagonist gaining sanctuary with a nonhuman race, facing an unwelcome marriage, and being saved by the reluctant bride's betrothed in his later novel The Pixilated Peeress (1991). In that novel Thorolf Zigramson, the hero, is adopted into a tribe of \\"trolls\\" (remnant Neanderthals), whose chief seeks to cement the alliance by the same expedient attempted by Indlovu in \\"The Blue Giraffe.\\" Notes Category:Short stories by L.

For clashes of the 2011, See Siege of Hama (2011) The 2014 Hama offensive, codenamed Ghazwat Badr al-Sham al-Kubra, was a military operation launched by Syrian rebels during the Syrian Civil War in the northern parts of Hama Governorate, in an attempt to reach the Hama Military Airport and the provincial capital of the province. It was also launched in an attempt to cut the supply line to Aleppo, especially after the rebels seized the village of Rajhan. Although the offensive was initially met with success, the Army quickly launched a counter-offensive on 26 August, resulting in the recapture of all territory lost to the rebels since 26 July and the takeover of new territory previously held by the rebels. Rebel offensive On 26 July, the rebels in Hama province captured the town of Khitab, Rahbeh village, Khitab arms depots and army base. The next day, clashes continued between pro- government forces and rebels in the western sides of Qamhana town and in the villages of al-Sher and al-Majdal in the western countryside of Hama near Maharda. On 28 July, rebels killed six soldiers and captured the \\"Btesh\\" checkpoint in Tarabih, located nine kilometers north of Hama military airport. During their advance, the rebels began striking the airport with Grad missiles. Meanwhile, new Army reinforcements arrived in the area. As the rebels advanced, they were able to cut off the road linking Hama city to a string of government-controlled Christian and Alawite villages in the west of the province. On 29 July, government forces recaptured Salba and Tall Mallah on the Hama‚ÄìSuqaylabiyah road. On 9 August, a pro-government source claimed that the Army thwarted a rebel attack on a garrison in Mhardeh. On 13 August, according to the pro-opposition SOHR, rebels recaptured the southwestern part of the town of Mork, while the Army began retreating to the outskirts of the town. However, fighting continued in the town the next day. At the same time, rebels captured the Tall al-Sheyha and the village of Arzeh, killing at least 12 soldiers, and placing themselves within 3‚Äì4 km of Hama Military Airport. According to the SOHR, the rebels lost six fighters that day. They lost another five fighters (including a battalion commander) the next day. On 16 August, rebels captured the al-Madajin checkpoint, while they were forced to retreat from al-Shayha village and Tall al-Sheyha due to heavy bombardments on the region. The rebels managed to recapture the hill later that day, destroying a tank in the progress. All five crew members were reportedly killed. On 18 August, a Syrian fighter jet was shot down by rebels near the Hama airport. The pilot was reportedly killed in the act. Rebels tried to enter the village of Qbayyat during the night, resulting in heavy clashes with pro-government fighters and soldiers. Army counter-attack The next day, Syrian forces regained control over the village of Um Hurayzah in the eastern countryside of Hama, while they also managed to advance towards Arze village. Seven rebels were killed during the day. On 20 August, the Army made new gains near the city of Halfaya, while two rebel commanders were killed during the day. Rebels capture Halfaya On 22 August, a rebel brigade commander was killed near the village of al-Shiha, while the Al-Nusra Front sent reinforcements (consisting of two convoys) from Aleppo to the south of Halfaya city. The next day, new reinforcements from Al-Nusra Front arrived near Mhardeh city and in the Halfaya area in preparations for the start of the battle for Mhardeh. On 23 August, a rebel attack on the Mhardeh power station was repelled. The next day, rebel forces, primarily composed of Al-Nusra fighters, captured the city of Halfaya. On 25 August, government troops recaptured the \\"Btesh\\" checkpoint but had to abandon it once again due to heavy rebel shelling. New Army counter-attack At this point, no less than 1,500 fighters from the Al-Nusra Front grouped in Halfaya and around Mhardeh, with the assault force personally led by the group's leader Abu Mohammad al- Jawlani. According to a source within Nusra, the Free Syrian Army rejected the idea of storming the Christian majority city of Mhardeh and hence the large number of reinforcements brought from Aleppo. Before the assault, al-Jawlani gave a speech to his fighters to boost morale. At the same time, military special forces reinforcements, known as the \\"Tiger Forces\\", arrived from Aleppo province, along with their commander, Col. Soheil Al-Hassan. On 26 August, the rebel attack on Mhardeh was launched and fighting raged for the numerous checkpoints defending the city. The same day, Army units captured rebel positions near the village of Shar'aya, as well as the village itself. On 27 August, rebels captured a number of soldiers near Arzeh, while fighting in the village itself was renewed later in the day. On 28 August, the Army captured Tall al-Sheyha hill and advanced in Bateesh, Arzeh and Khitab. The rebels used the hill to bombard the airport in previous days. Later in the day, the \\"Btesh\\" checkpoint was once again reported to be government-held but coming under rebel fire. By this point, the rebel attack on Mhardeh was seen as to have failed following the military counterattack during which government troops recaptured checkpoints along the road leading to Halfaya. Two days later, the pro-government Al-Masdar News site reported the NDF forces, supported by the reinforcements, repelled a rebel infiltration attempt near the Mhardeh power plant. On 7 September, the Army recaptured Arzeh, while 17 rebels (including a commander) were killed in fighting along the frontline. Al-Masdar News also claimed the Army recaptured Deir Hamra, near the airport. The next day, rebels captured the Seher Hill checkpoint, while Army units advanced in the Sen Seher - Zor al Qse‚Äôeyyi area and the village of Zor Bel Hsein. On 9 September, the Army recaptured Khitab, Zor Bel Hsein, Zor al Masaleq, Zor al Jdid and Kherbet al Hjame, and the Rahbat Khitab military base,SYRIA DIRECT: NEWS UPDATE 9-9-14 while according to Al-Masdar News, Army and NDF units also seized the villages of Al-Samama and Qamaha and two neighborhoods in Halfaya. An al-Nusra Front commander was killed near Halfaya during the day's fighting. With government troops regaining control of these villages and the rebels pushed back, Hama military airport was no longer threatened. The next day, Syrian and Iranian forces recaptured the southern part of Halfaya city, the \\"Btesh\\" checkpoint and the farmlands of Btesh. On 11 September, the military made further advances in Halfaya leaving a large part of the area under government control. In the evening, the Army secured Halfaya. On 13 September, government troops captured a further three towns in Hama province, including Taibet al-Imam, Lweibdah and Zour Abo Zaid, and inflicted \\"gross losses\\" among opposition fighters, just two days after they fully recaptured Halfaya. In addition, on 15 September, the Army seized captured Zalaqiyat, and the next day, seized Jadidah, Jalma, Tall Melh, Kafr Hawad and Tremseh. Thus, government forces reached the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Al-Lataminah. On 17 September, the rebels recaptured Tall Melh, Zalaqiyat Tremseh and Jalma after they infiltrated the villages. During the fighting, 28 soldiers were killed. The military also reportedly managed to seize the southwest entrance of Al-Lataminah. Over the next two days, government troops regained control of Tall Melh, Tremseh and Jalma after killing at least 29 rebel fighters. They then proceeded to fortify Tall Melh, Jadidah and Abu Zaher against any further infiltration. On 19 September, the Army also captured the villages of Abu Redeh and Hasraya. The day before, a rebel media activist declared the rebel offensive that started in late July to be over.SYRIA DIRECT: 'THE BADR A-SHAM CAMPAIGN IS OVER' Aftermath ‚Äì Army capture of Mork On 30 September, the Army captured the villages of al- Buwaydah and al-Masasnah. According to a military source, over 25 Al-Nusra militants were killed in the fighting, including an aide of Abu Mohammad Al- Jolani. On 6 October, the Army captured Al-Jabin, as well as two other towns. On 23 October, government forces took back total control of the strategically important city Mork, nine months after it was seized by rebels and their al- Qaeda allies. The same day, the Syrian army captured Tal Itmeen after clashes with rebels who were retreating from Mork. One week later, the SAA also captured Tall Sayid, northeast of Kafr Zita. On 4 November, SAA took control of Qabr Farat and Al-Kareem near the border of Idlib. Strategic analysis The rebel offensive forced government forces to step up their troop presence in the area, which would limit the Army's capabilities in other areas, such as Aleppo, according to a rebel commander. The aim of the rebel offensive was to capture the military airport and stop the Air force from manufacturing barrel bombs, which were being manufactured at the base and used for many months to strike opposition-controlled areas across Syria.

H.R. 3109 was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It was not passed in the Senate, and expired at the conclusion of the 113th United States Congress. Background The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), codified at , is a United States federal law, first enacted in 1916 in order to implement the convention for the protection of migratory birds between the United States and Great Britain (acting on behalf of Canadahttp://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf). The statute makes it unlawful without a waiver to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill or sell birds listed therein (\\"migratory birds\\"). The statute does not discriminate between live or dead birds and also grants full protection to any bird parts including feathers, eggs and nests. Over 800 species are currently on the list.http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/regulationspolicies/mbta/mbtandx.html The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issues permits for otherwise prohibited activities under the act. These include permits for taxidermy, falconry, propagation, scientific and educational use, and depredation, an example of the latter being the killing of geese near an airport, where they pose a danger to aircraft. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 3109 would amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to provide that nothing in such Act prohibits possessing, selling, bartering, purchasing, shipping, and transporting any authentic Alaskan Native article of handicraft or clothing on the basis that it contains a nonedible migratory bird part. Makes such exemption inapplicable with respect to any handicraft or clothing containing any part of a migratory bird that was taken in a wasteful manner. H.R. 3109 would define \\"authentic Alaskan Native article of handicraft or clothing\\" to mean any item that is composed of natural materials and produced, decorated, or fashioned by an Alaskan Native (Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who resides in Alaska), in the exercise of traditional Alaskan Native handicrafts, without the use of any pantograph or other mass copying device, including any weaving, carving, stitching, sewing, lacing, beading, drawing, or painting. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3109 would amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow Alaskan Natives to make and sell traditional handicrafts such as masks, jewelry, clothing, and hunting equipment that are made from parts of migratory birds, particularly feathers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would not have a significant effect on the federal budget. Because enacting the legislation could reduce revenues and associated direct spending from civil and criminal penalties, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any such effects would be negligible. H.R. 3109 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 3109 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 17, 2013 by Rep. Don Young (R, AK-0). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. On September 8, 2014, the bill passed the House in a voice vote. Debate and discussion In testimony before Congress, a spokesperson for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) stated that it \\"does not support H.R. 3109.\\" According to the spokesperson, \\"in 1886, 5 million birds were estimated to be killed for their feathers.\\" The goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was to end \\"the commercial trade in birds and their feathers that, by the early years of the 20th century, had devastated populations of many native bird species.\\" The Department did acknowledge, however, \\"the economic and cultural need in Alaska Native communities to improve their quality of life with opportunities to benefit from their unique handicrafts and other traditional items.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3109 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3109 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3109 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3109 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3109 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3109 * Migratory Bird Treaty on Cornell's U.S. Code Collection * List of bird species covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty * U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's guide to U.S. laws protecting migratory birds (including the Migratory Bird Treaty) Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Bird conservation Category:Alaska Natives and United States law ","title":"H.R. 3109 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"43435199","text":"Jim Madaffer is an American businessman, entrepreneur and former politician.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History and architecture The church dates from the early 13th century, however many elements of the church vary in date. The east sections, the chancel and transeptal chapels, all belong to the late 13th century. The tower as well as the transepts date to the 14th century, while the nave and south aisle belong to the mid 16th century. John Newman goes into more detail: the earliest features of the church are the west arches of the north chapel (all now being blocked), as well as the south transept, all being built in the late 12th century. The north and west walls of the north chapel contain reused Early Norman masonry. By around the turn of the 13th century, the church had grown to include an aisled nave, as well as either transepts or chancel chapels. Benjamin Ferrey's provided restoration work on the church between 1874 and 1875, however this work dealt only on the chancel in the east.The Buildings of England. North East and East Kent. Nikolaus Pevsner. Penguin Group. p.498 The chancel and transepts were rebuilt as a result of the college foundation process. This can be best studied in the architecture of the south transept; the window of the shallow east projection is unrestored. The window was three-light, featuring three circles in the head, each being enclosed by three pointed trefoils. The chancel arch and the chancel's east window were restored during Ferrey's 1874-1875 work. The north chapel was originally duplicated from the south transept; both chapels open into the chancel through identical arches in an Early English style. There exists a two-storey eastward extension of the north transept, dating to the 15th century; the north window of this extension is timber, possibly dating to the 18th century. The chancel windows stand upon a continuous string course, retaining their original houd moulds. The east piscina and the triple sedilia are cinquefoiled, featuring flattened arches upon detached shafts, as well as moulded caps and bases. The chancel and nave of the church The west tower begun construction during the late 13th century; this is evident in the remains of the lancets in the lower stage. The spire is recessed and dates to the 14th century; it reaches a height of 63 feet, and is built in a Hertfordshire style. Angle buttresses are present almost to the top. A stair- turret is built into the northwest of the tower. The west window is renewed. There is a tower arch high up, on octagonal responds with the capitals dotted with four-petalled flowers. Rebuilding of the nave and the south aisle began in the late 15th century, with the 14th-century south porch being retained as a two-storey structure, minus its upper floor. The north aisle however was not rebuilt, giving the church its current unique shape. The walls of these reconstructed sections are of knapped flint and are carefully laid; triangular stones can be found set into the south wall. This reconstruction work was continued slowly, and last until well after the Dissolution of the Monasteries; there are regular bequests to the rebuilding recorded between 1526 and 1562. Work was underway during the 1540s, however in 1555 money meant for the rebuilding was embezzled by a local beer brewer. This resulted in the arcade being completed in timber instead of the intended stone: the piers are unmoulded posts, braced weakly. At some point before the 19th century, the braces were dressed up in plaster so as to look like Doric columns; during Ferrey's restoration work the braces were undressed again. Fittings The church possesses a 15th-century stone reredos, purportedly from Troyes; above are five scenes of the Passion of Christ, and below is the Last Supper and Adoration of the Kings; the lower two occupy the same length as the Passion scenes above. The base to a 15th-century rood screen is present. There are four misericords on the north side, as well as three on the south side; the latter are older, probably dating to the early 14th century. The chancel's south window contains early 14th century grisaille glass in the head. The east window contains stained glass dating to 1919, depicting multiple brightly coloured scenes of the Passion. Monuments The Oxenden Memorial A monument to Charles Tripp (died 1624) exists in the south chapel, in the form of a tablet that is largely identical to that of another monument in St James the Great, Elmsted. A monument to Sir Thomas Palmer (dated to 1624) lies in the east of the north chapel; this was sculpted by Nicholas Stone. A monument was erected for the Oxenden family, dated to 1682 and free-standing in the centre of the south transept. A monument to a second Thomas Palmer (died 1656) exists in the north chapel; this monument was erected in 1718. A double tablet monument was erected for Streynsham Master (died 1718) exists in the north chapel. A tablet monument to Thomas Cinder (died 1719) is erected in the south aisle. A more recent monument was erected for William Miller (died 1861). St Mary's College, Wingham The Old Canonry, Wingham. Possibly one of the residences for the Canons of the College In 1282 a College of Canons was founded by John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury. The college originally consisted of a Provost and six canons, and they used St Mary's as their church. It survived as a collegiate institution until the dissolution of colleges and chantries in 1548. =Provosts of Wingham= Organ The church has three manual pipe organ dating from 1886 by Forster and Andrews. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.
