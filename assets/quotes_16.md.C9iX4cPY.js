It was originally located in Vergennes, Vermont. History The town of Vergennes, Vermont built the schoolhouse about 1840 on land leased from General Samuel Strong, an American Revolutionary War officer and descendant of one of Addison County‚Äôs first families. In the terms of the lease Strong stipulated that the town pay him an annual rent of one kernel of Indian corn and use the property for educational purposes.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. The schoolhouse, although built at the height of Greek Revival‚Äôs popularity, reflects an amalgamation of architectural styling. Moderate classical elements include the arched door, sash windows, and projecting bell tower, while the split-gable and octagonal shape of the bell tower‚Äôs cupola reflect 19th-century Eclecticism that developed as local builders and craftsmen freely combined elements from different architectural styles. On the exterior, the bricklayer ornamented the one-room structure with a simple patterning of six rows of stretchers (horizontally-laid bricks) and one row of headers (end-laid bricks) that formed subtle bands circling the building. Relocation When the Shelburne Museum relocated the Schoolhouse to its present site in 1947, the structure had been in disuse for many years. In preparation for the building‚Äôs restoration, the Museum created architectural drawings of the building‚Äôs exterior before removing the belfry and dismantling the brickwork piece-by- piece. The Museum replaced the original tinwork of the belfry‚Äôs dome with stronger copper, repaired its acorn finial, replaced missing windows, resurfaced the plastered interior walls, and re-hung the bell. The inclusion of desks, benches, and maps reflect the modest furnishings of a 19th-century rural school. One-Room Schoolhouse One-room schools were commonplace throughout rural portions of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In most rural (country) and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single teacher taught academic basics to five to eight grade levels of elementary-age boys and girls. For more information see One-room school School in the 19th century The early school room was about 20 feet square with a huge fireplace in the front. Later heat was supplied by an iron wood stove. Two privies were out back, one for the boys and one for the girls. Drinking water was ladled out of a wooden pail. The buildings were dark and often dirty, with no insulation to keep out the winter cold. There were no playgrounds and often no shade. There were few text books. Children used slates and a Bible as school supplies.Shelburne Museum. \\"The Addison Country Spelling Bee\\" School Program. 2009. Seats were often arranged with the smallest in the front and the tallest in the back so the teacher could see each head. Schools were only open a few months a year and consisted of winter and summer sessions (usually December‚ÄìMarch and then mid-May to August). The older boys were usually working in the fields during the summer, so they only attended in the winter. Men predominated as teachers until the early 19th century, but by the mid-19th century most teachers were women. Women could be teachers only if they were unmarried; as soon as they married, another teacher was hired. Women were paid half the salaries as men. Students ranged in age from 4 or 5 to 21 and sometimes toddlers went to school with older siblings who were caregivers. In 1870 in Vermont the average cost to educate one student was $13.60 per year. Grading did not exist. Curriculum consisted of the fundamentals of reading, spelling, writing, and calculating. Students recited the alphabet, the definitions of spelling words, the rules of grammar, arithmetic facts, and long prose passages. Few students went beyond the fundamentals taught in the one-room schoolhouse. Teachers were themselves often 14 or 15 years old with no advanced training. Correct conduct was considered the most important part of a student‚Äôs education. Boys entered the school room, took off their hats, and bowed to the teacher and others. On leaving school they would bow again. Girls would enter, bow or curtsey, and repeat on leaving.

Biography Sandro Mussa- Ivaldi obtained a degree (Laurea) in Physics from the University of Torino (1978) and a PhD in biomedical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano (1987). He was a postdoctoral fellow and principal research scientist in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the MIT. He is now Professor of Physiology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. He is the founder and director of the Robotics Laboratory in the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Scientific Contributions Mussa-Ivaldi‚Äôs research combines experimental methods with the application of computational principles. His experimental work has been influential for the study of arm biomechanics and, in particular, motor learning in human subjects. He has also studied motor primitives in the frog's spinal cord that are a central issue in many theories of motor control. Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi's theoretical work has focused on the analysis of redundant kinematics in human subjects. He has asked how a variety of movement patterns and control strategies can be constructed from the superposition of a set of basis fields. Of particular theoretical importance is his discovery of how pseudoinverses of Jacobians can be computed so that integrability is always a given. In some more recent work, Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi has applied computational ideas to the design of brain machine interfaces. He and his collaborators have developed the first neurorobotic system in which a neural preparation in-vitro - the brainstem of a Lamprey - controls the behavior of a mobile-robot through a closed-loop interaction.

The GR-300 had no MIDI and could only be played through a GR-300 series guitar controller. The actual synthesizer module sat on the floor and had the rugged appearance of a large guitar-type foot pedal (complete with carrying handles). It featured 6-voice polyphony, one voice per string and 2 oscillators per voice. Each pair of VCOs were harmonically locked to each string but could be tuned separately to play different pitches. The GR-300 also featured a VCF with variable lengthsweep up and down, and an LFO. Each string had an enable-disable switch as well as a string sensitivity switch (basically audio compression). Built-in footswitches controlled the VCO mode (single/dual), the VCO harmonize pitch (detuning of the VCO's), and the VCF mode (on, bypass, or inverted). There was also a pedal control input for the VCF. The GR-300 could output either the guitar, the synth, or a mix of the two.

Built and operated during the 1980s in Coweta County, Georgia, STEP used solar energy to provide electricity and process heat to a manufacturing facility. Developed as part of the National Solar Thermal Energy Program, which was instituted after the oil crises of the 1970s,http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=5155159 STEP STEP was jointly financed by the United States Department of Energy and Georgia Power http://www.georgiapower.com/about/pdf/Renewable%20Energy%20Research%20ext%20page.pdf to advance development of nonconventional renewable energy technology. The objective was to design, construct, operate and evaluate a solar thermal energy system that could provide electrical power, process steam and absorption air conditioning to an adjacent knitwear factory. Project history In 1977, DoE selected a joint proposal by Georgia Power and the Westinghouse Advanced Energy Systems Division from a field of 16 competitors from 14 states for STEP's site and commercial application. Design work was completed between 1978 and 1980 under DoE sponsorship (with Georgia Power cost-sharing support) through the construction and test operations phases. The project was formally dedicated and began test operations in May 1982. Georgia Power assumed full responsibility for STEP's commercial operation in 1984 and continued the project beyond 1987. The project was conceived by Edward J. Ney, a Westinghouse energy physicist who later became a nationally recognized expert on solar energy systems. Ney was the Project Integrator while with Westinghouse, later joining Georgia Power as Manager of Solar Operations and STEP Project Manager. He brought the involved parties into a joint-venture agreement and subsequently oversaw design, construction, test operations, commercial operations, and eventual decommissioning and disassembly of the Project. Site The site for the five-plus acre project was Solar Circle, along Amlajack Boulevard, in a commercial park within the former planned community of Shenandoah, Georgia, now part of the city of Newnan. While STEP was shut down and dismantled by 1991, the site of the collector field is still visible from the air, albeit with mature pine trees growing through the crumbling pavement within the still-fenced enclosure. The overall site includes an education center at 7 Solar Circle, between the former collector field and Amlajack Blvd. The facility, known as the University of West Georgia Newnan Center, accommodates classes in a range of curricula. Industrial application The industrial application for the project was a knitwear factory operated by Bleyle of America Inc. STEP provided a large part of the electricity for the facility, displacing fossil fuels normally used to generate power to run the factory. STEP also provided process heat for absorption air conditioning within the building, as well as steam (downstream from the turbine) for pressing the knitwear products. The building was designed with a series of features for energy efficiency, including reduced height to minimize wall area and interior volume, a 4-ft insulating earthen berm around the building, north-south orientation, heavily insulated roof and walls, high-efficiency fluorescent lighting, energy-efficient production equipment, and an air conditioning system with an economizer cycle. According to Georgia Power, which monitored the facility's energy requirements as part of the STEP design process, energy conserving features alone reduced the factory's energy consumption by 46 percent. STEP was designed according to electrical, air conditioning and process steam loads already established by the knitwear factory, which began operations during STEP's design phase. These parameters, which represent the facility's relatively constant peak load profile, were used for system design. References Further reading *Ney, E.J.

It was inaugurated in the year 1904, and originally was named the Carlos Gomes Theatre. In the second government of Alberto Maranh√£o, the theater closed for renovations. It reopened as the \\"Gran-Campa√±ia Espa√±ola de Zarzuela, Opera y Opereta Pablo L√≥pez\\", 19 July 1912, with the operetta \\"Princesa dos d√≥lares\\" (\\"Princess of dollars\\") by Leo Fall.

Plywood sheets are usually used for this but an alternative is plastic sheeting. Specialists use 32-foot rolls of tough plastic for this and are able to wrap a complete house in 90 minutes. This has the advantage of waterproofing storm-damaged property but will not protect it from looters or squatters as the plastic may be cut.

It is situated on the River Suir, seven miles west of Clonmel. The castle is currently privately owned and is not open for public viewing. Ardfinnan Castle, Ardfinnan. The Anglo-Norman castle is positioned on a large rocky incline and it looks out over the Suir valley with the Knockmealdown Mountains to the south, and the Galtee Mountains to the northwest. The castle is a parallelogram in shape with square battlements at the corners and a fortified entrance gateway.  Early history  The castle was built in 1185 by order of John of England, then Lord of Ireland, during his first expedition to Ireland. To guard the northern border of Waterford, John's father Henry II of England proposed Ardfinnan and Tybroughney on the river Suir, with Lismore on the Blackwater as key positions to erect castles. Most importantly, Ardfinnan would secure a passage from the Anglo-Norman- occupied southern sea-board into central Ireland. John arrived in Waterford in April 1185, after which he soon granted the Cambro-Norman knight Maurice de Prendergast with the Manor of Ardfinnan, in which he was tasked with the construction of Ardfinnan Castle and to defend it as its governor. In opposition to John's construction of the castles, Lismore Castle was taken by surprise in an attack by the Irish, and its governor, Robert de Barry, was slain along with his entire garrison. King of Munster Donal O'Brien, King of Connacht Rory O'Conner and King of Desmond Dermod MacCarthy, now headed for Ardfinnan. Opposite the imposing castle and on the other side of the river, it became aware to O'Brien that he would not be able to take it by force. Indicating retreat, he turned back only to be pursued by the small garrison of knights holding Ardfinnan Castle, which for O'Brien would play the advantage. He swiftly turned back towards Ardfinnan and surrounded the now exposed knights, slaying a large portion of them and subsequently taking Ardfinnan Castle. After this and further successive defeats against the Irish Kings, John's original force of 300 men was decimated, and by December of that same year, 1185, he was summoned back to England by his father. The castle was promptly retaken and would continue to regularly change hands between the vying Anglo-Normans, until it was handed over to the Knights Templar, and later granted to the Knights Hospitaller. While the Hospitallers protected this important pass between Cashel and Lismore, they constructed the castle's surviving circular keep in the early 13th century. Front portion of the remains of the 13th-century keep, uncommon in Ireland for being round and not square in shape.  Cromwellian siege  On Saturday 2 February 1650 major general Henry Ireton, who was accompanying Oliver Cromwell in his conquest of Ireland, had neither the boats or sufficient weather in order to make a crossing of the river Suir with his army and subsequently headed for the bridge at Ardfinnan to gain another crucial pass over the river Suir, second to the pass at Carrick. In view of taking hold of the strategically placed castle which guarded this crossing from high above, he waited until around four o‚Äôclock the next morning to attempt a siege. Defending the castle from the Parliamentarians with a small force of soldiers was David Fitzgibbon (the White Knight), Governor of Ardfinnan Castle for Charles II. With cannons placed on a hill opposite the castle, Ireton bombarded its once impenetrable walls until there was a large breakthrough after about 8 shots and then proceeded to kill about thirteen of the out-guard and lost only two of his men with about ten wounded. After this the castle was promptly surrendered to the New Model Army who would use it as a garrison throughout their time in Ireland. Fitzgibbon was spared his life for his swift surrender of the castle, but subsequently lost his lands at Ardfinnan and was transplanted to Connacht in 1653. Guns, ammunition and other supplies arriving at Youghal would be brought over the river Blackwater at the pass at Cappoquin and then finally over the river Suir at Ardfinnan to reach the rest of the army in Tipperary. With the end of the Cromwellian campaign of Ireland, the leaving Parliamentarian troops slighted Ardfinnan castle which partially left it in ruins.  British Army garrison  In 1795 with the threat of invasion during the French Revolutionary Wars, the castle was once again occupied as a military garrison, with British Army fencible units. Despite being in ruins, the position of the castle still commanded over a chief pass on the river Suir and it would be used along with the rest of the Ardfinnan and Neddans area to hold a British Army summer training camp, with reserves ready against French invasion. Training in firing and marching were essential in forging these militia into an effective military force. Although initially established as a temporary encampment for the summer months, it became a permanent camp in March 1796 by the orders of John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, which amounted a force of 2,740 mainly Protestant soldiers. The camp was disbanded by 1802.  Restoration  In the early 19th century, 15 acres with Ardfinnan Castle were reinstated to the descendants of Maurice de Prendergast, who were now descended of the Prendergasts' of Newcastle. The castle's tower-house received a Victorian restoration around 1846, with the addition of adjoining buildings and was essentially turned into a country house.A summer visit to Ireland in 1846, Whitby West, Richard Bentley 1847 The last male member of this family to occupy the castle was Royal Navy Admiral, Sir Robert Prendergast, KBC who settled in Eastbourne following his retirement in 1920. He was a suspected victim of the serial killer Dr. John Bodkin Adams when he died in 1946. From 1922 the castle was in the ownership of the Mulcahys' of the prosperous Ardfinnan Woollen Mills which the castle overshadows, on what was formerly the site of the Prendergast's flour mill. Further restorations to the house were made by 1929. The latest addition is the three-storey gable-ended wing, likely added during the 1930s.

The fire also burned the villages of Graceton, Pitt, Williams, and Cedar Spur, Minnesota. Damage was horrific yet less so in the communities of Zipple, Roosevelt, Swift and Warroad in the U.S. and Stratton, Pinewood, Rainy River, and Sprague across the river in Canada, which also suffered losses. The Town of Rainy River lost its lumber mill, but saved many of the residents of Baudette and Spooner since the residential area was not affected. Their American friends were welcomed into homes where they remained for a very long time as their homes had to be rebuilt, creating a strong bond between the two communities. Region overview Lake Of The Woods County was known for its logging industry during the early 1900s. Similar to other forest fires, this disaster was sparked in dry, harvested timber land that was vulnerable to potential fire destruction. Homesteaders earned money by cutting and selling their wood to various buyers. The logging industry was the main employer in the area, as timber was big business. Several large sawmills had been established early at Rainy River, Baudette and Spooner on the bay of the Baudette River. Timber was floated down the tributaries of the Rainy River to the mills or hauled to the various railroad depots for shipment to markets via rail. When the logging industry was at its peak, a skilled person could walk across the logs filling the bay before being floated downstream. Most of the land of new homesteads was still covered with timber. The limited number of cleared fields were small, generally cultivated to produce enough grain for animal feed and produce for household use. This large tract of forest, broken up with small fields and slash-filled cut-over areas, had conditions that supported development of a large conflagration. Firestorm On October 7 a forest fire raged out of control across Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota, leveling everything in its path. The fire erupted out of the slash left behind from logging, sparked by trains or small brush fires. Fires were extreme because the weather conditions were extreme that year, especially nationwide. The region had suffered a severe drought for months which, combined with the available fuels and heavy winds, resulted in a massive blaze. Survivors believe that there were four main fires to start with, which grew, merged, and raced quickly toward the towns. Residents made no attempts to fight the fire, because it had developed so quickly and covered such a large area, catching people by surprise. The settlements burned down in less than two hours, including the railroad bridge over the bay that connected the two towns. The aftermath of the fire was bleak: the streets were smoke-laden and wind-blown streets, the towns barren except for the piles of rubble from the burned buildings. The countryside was covered with ashes. By the end of the day the villages of Cedar Spur, Graceton, Pitt, Baudette and Spooner lay in ruins. Four hundred thousand acres were blackened. Homesteads across the county were destroyed and 43 lives were lost. Relief operations Residents of Spooner and Baudette found refuge by riding trains across the Rainy River to the town of Rainy River, Ontario. Sources estimated the death toll between 29 and 42 people. Thousands were left homeless and winter was fast approaching. The American Red Cross assisted survivors; a tent city was built in a day to provide shelter, and many supplies were donated in order to rebuild. The Red Cross and the National Guard immediately began the rebuilding effort and many homesteaders now turned to the chore of land clearing with hopes for a crop in the spring. The lumber mills were either spared or undamaged; and so there was some reason for hopefulness for the future. The Baudette Fire was the third worst fire in the history of Minnesota measured by casualties, after the 1918 Cloquet Fire and the Great Hinckley Fire of 1894. Legacy The total amount of land burned in the state of Minnesota in 1910 was estimated by Forestry Commissioner C. C. Andrews to be greater than . The Baudette Fire, along with the Great Hinckley Fire, helped Andrews convince others that active management of forest practices was necessary to prevent such massive fires. For this reason, the 1910 Baudette Burn is considered one of the most significant wildfires in Minnesota history. As a direct result of this catastrophe, the legislature approved funds to establish the Minnesota Forestry Service (later the DNR), which was developed with a system of forest rangers and forestry districts to manage the lumber industry practices. Memorials On October 13, 1910 a funeral service was held for 27 fire victims, who were buried in a mass grave at Elm Park Cemetery, Baudette. A marker for them was erected at the grave site. A historical marker commemorating the Baudette Fire is located on Minnesota State Highway 72 on the US side of the Baudette-Rainy River International Bridge.

In the liner notes to his album, Ritual of the Savage (Le sacre du sauvage), Baxter described the themes he was conveying in the work:Baxter, Les (1952). \\"Ritual of the Savage (Le sacre du sauvage)\\" [sleeve notes]. Capitol Records.  Martin Denny version  In the mid-1950s, Martin Denny and his band performed at a restaurant in Oahu, The Shell Bar, and frequently would play Baxter cover songs. One night, while his group was performing, Denny realized bullfrogs were croaking along to the music. As a joke, the band began incorporating frog sounds and birdcalls into the performance. Soon after, people began requesting \\"the song with the frogs.\\" \\"They really enjoyed the frogs!\\" Denny observed. \\"And they thought we were making those croaking noises. So I understood that this was the way to go.\\" The squawks and jungle sounds in the Martin Denny version of \\"Quiet Village\\" were performed by A. Purves Pullen, also known as Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath. In 1957, Denny and his group released a cover of the song featuring exotic instruments and sounds that made it to number four on the pop singles chart on June 1, 1959 and number eleven on the R&B; chart. Denny also recorded a stereo version of the song in 1959, a bossa nova version in 1964, and a version performed on a Moog synthesizer in 1969. He released an album with a similar title (Quiet Village, the Exotic Sounds of Martin Denny) in 1959.  Other cover versions  In 1959, actress and singer Darla Hood recorded the first vocal version in the wake of the huge success that Martin Denny had with his instrumental version. Released on Ray Note Records and credited to Darla Hood & Fabulous Modesto Orch, which was percussionist Modesto Duran's Orchestra. In 1977, The Ritchie Family recorded a disco version and added vocals. The single was included on their African Queens album. Along with the album's title track and \\"Summer Dance\\", \\"Quiet Village\\" hit number one for three weeks on the disco/dance chart in 1977. However, unlike the Martin Denny version, The Ritchie Family recording did not chart on the pop singles chart. It did peak at #68 on the R&B; singles chart. In 1986, composer Mark Mothersbaugh incorporated the song and animal sounds into the prelude theme for the children's television program Pee-wee's Playhouse. Influential noise artist Boyd Rice and writer/publisher Adam Parfrey released a comedic version of the song entitled \\"Quiet Village Idiot\\" under the moniker \\"The Tards\\" in 1993. In 1991 Guitarist Danny Gatton recorded a version on the album \\"88 Elmira Street\\". This version introduced Les Baxter and Martin Denny's music to a new generation of listeners/musicians.

In February 2013 the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Fort Atkinson Historic District. History Remains of north barracks, showing exposed interior fireplaces Fort Atkinson north barracks in 1912, after abandonment The 1830 Treaty of Prairie du Chien, negotiated between the United States and various tribes, established the Neutral Ground: the tribes agreed to land cession of a strip of land, two strips of land wide each on either side of the boundary roughly from present-day La Crosse, Wisconsin and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, extending from the Mississippi River to the Des Moines River in what today is southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa. Originally planned as a buffer zone between the Sioux, Sac and Fox Nations, the land was soon designated for the Ho-Chunk (or Winnebago) tribe after their removal from Wisconsin. Fort Atkinson was founded to keep the Ho-Chunk on the Neutral Ground, and to protect them from other tribes as well as prevent white traders and settlers from intruding on Indian land. The post was also reinforced the authority of the U.S. government official who operated a school, model farm and provided supplies to the Ho-Chunk. A camp was founded on the site on May 31, 1840 by Cpt. Lynde commanding Co. F, 5th US Infantry and named after Henry Atkinson, the commanding officer in charge of the Ho-Chunk resettlement. The fort took three years to construct and was completed by the end of summer of 1842. Company B, 1st US Dragoons arrived on June 24, 1840, remaining until June 20, 1846. Co. F, 5th US Infantry was replaced on Sept 10, 1841 by Co. K, 1st US Infantry, which recently arrived from Florida. Co. I, 1st US Dragoons under Captain James AllenCaptain James Allen at http://www.jlindquist.com/allen.html was additionally posted at Ft. Atkinson from August to November 1842, the three companies marked the largest garrison at the post during its history with 196 soldiers in the garrison in August 1842. Co. A & B, 1st US Infantry were each briefly at the post in the spring and summer of 1843. Co. E, 1st US Infantry, replaced Co. K on May 19, 1844. The infantry left the post on Sept 9, 1845. After Co. B, 1st US Dragoons left in June 1846, to report to Ft. Leavenworth in response to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the post was briefly vacant. Morgan's Iowa Company of Volunteer Infantry began staffing the fort on July 15, 1846. Parker's Iowa Company of Mounted Volunteers arrived in September 1846, but was disbanded as being too expensive in November 1846. Morgan's Company was reorganized as a mounted unit in July 1847 and helped moved the Ho-Chuck from Iowa to Minnesota in June 1848. The last of the militia left on September 11, 1848. The fort was again briefly vacant until Co. C, 6th US Infantry under Captain T L Alexander reached the post from Mexico on Sept. 28, 1848. The fort was abandoned by the 6th US Infantry on February 24, 1849.Steven M. Baule, A brief look back at Ft. Atkinson, Iowa and the Year 1843, Ft. Dodge, IGG, 1992. The fort was sold at public auction in 1855. The private owners had the land surveyed and platted for the town of Fort Atkinson. In 1906, a geologic study of Winneshiek County named the stone used in the fort as the Fort Atkinson Limestone Member of the Maquoketa Group, having originated from a shallow tropical sea 440 million years ago. The state of Iowa acquired the fort in 1921 and reconstruction started in 1958. In 1968, the fort was dedicated as part of the State Preserves System because of its geological, archaeological and historical value. Design 1842 sketch of Fort Atkinson The fort included 24 buildings and an 11'9\\" stockade, outside of which were 14 additional buildings. The design was typical of frontier posts, using a rectangular layout enclosed by a wooden picket-stockade. A parade ground was at the center, surrounded by four main barracks. Cannon houses sat at the northeast and southwest corners, a gunpowder magazine in the southeast corner and a commissary in the northwest. Buildings outside the fort included the granary, bakery, blacksmith and stables. The buildings were constructed out of limestone quarried nearby or hewn logs with cut-pine shingle roofs.

The channel was launched on March 21, 1995 under the name \\"Viva II\\" as a second channel to the main channel VIVA in Germany and lasted until January 7, 2002, when it got replaced by Viva Plus. Unlike VIVA, Viva Zwei focused on more alternative styles of music, especially indie and alternative rock, metal, alternative hip hop and electronic music. It was also devoted to music from lesser known bands that could use Viva Zwei to get their music heard and was aimed at a more adult and more sophisticated audience while other music channels such as VIVA and MTV were aimed towards a mainstream audience that mainly consisted of teenagers and young adults. Even though it was not well-known to the music world, Viva Zwei was considered an important music channel for alternative styles of music and an example of a music channel dedicated to less mainstream music and aimed at a less mainstream audience. However, it never managed to become a financial success and piled up losses that led to its discontinuation. The main channel VIVA was discontinued at the end of 2018. History = 1995 ‚Äì 1996: The beginning = One of the first shows on Viva Zwei was Geschmackssache, a German TV show that featured singers from around the world. The singer would talk about himself or herself and would show some of their favorite music videos to the viewers. Viva Zwei's logo at the time was a logo in a transverse wave form similar to the VIVA logo with a Roman numeral 2 (II) sign beside it, and it was put into the upper right corner of the screen. In mid 1996, the logo was changed to a logo similar of a plus sign with the uppercase word \\"ZWEI\\" beside it, and it was put into the lower left corner of the screen. The 1995‚Äì1996 original Viva Zwei channel (more known as Viva II at the time) aired mostly classic 60s, 70s and 80s music as well as current 90s pop music and shows like Das War... (translated into the English language: That Was..., for example: Das War 1964 (That Was 1964), Das War 1974 (That Was 1974), Das War 1984 (That Was 1984), Das War 1994 (That Was 1994) etc.) and Geschmackssache. At this time, VIVA was the mainstream channel for shows. = 1997 ‚Äì 2001: Change in concept = In 1997, more programming started to be aired such as 2Rock, 2Step, Fast Forward, Trendspotting, Wah2 and Zwobot. The channel now focused more on current, alternative styles of music, mainly alternative and indie rock, but also metal, alternative hip hop and electronic music, and started becoming a place for lesser known bands that were not aired on MTV or VIVA to get their music heard, as well as airing music from bigger name stars such as Depeche Mode. = 2001 ‚Äì 2002: Closure = By 2001, the channel became more popular, but its owner, Time Warner, was losing money; Viva Zwei was generating losses and was not popular enough to survive. In mid-summer 2001, it was announced that Viva Zwei would be shut down. The shutdown occurred on January 7, 2002. The final video on the network was a sendoff video, a special thanks to Viva Zwei's hosts, a music video from Zwobot, and Mr. Explosion from Zwobot. Then, Viva Zwei switched full time into Viva Plus, a channel dedicated to mainstream pop music. This was considered to be a loss to the music world by fans of the old channel as well as music personalities, because it eliminated a medium for lesser known bands to be recognized. Some shows lived on on Viva Plus or VIVA though: Fast Forward, a German music talk show hosted by Charlotte Roche, aired on Viva Zwei from 1999 to 2001, moved to VIVA in 2002 and lasted there until January 2, 2005. On January 2, the farewell episode of Fast Forward aired without Charlotte Roche. It aired only music videos, and at the end broadcast a message saying \\"Fast Forward Say Thank You\\" and ended showing its usual closing sequence. Overdrive ran on Viva Zwei from 1998 to 2002, came back on Viva Plus later in 2002 and lasted there until 2007, when Viva Plus shut down. 2Step and E-Beats were slated to have come back on Viva Plus, but the idea was canceled when it was decided that Viva Plus would only broadcast Get the Clip. On 14 January 2007, Viva Plus itself was discontinued and replaced by Comedy Central.

The title, which is a part of the Carmen Sandiego franchise, was released by The Learning Company on June 1, 1999. It can be played by up to 4 players, and runs on the Mohawk engine. Development The 1000 questions over 7 subjects in the game were written and developed by teachers. the game was first to give Carmen Sandiego players a multiplayer option. The title reviews curriculum for fourth- through sixth-graders. There was a promotion where if players picked up their copy from CompUSA8, they would be entered into a draw with the chance to win Carmen Sandiego prizes. There was also a competition called \\"2000 TECHNOLOGY & LEARNING Teacher of the Year Awards program\\", with Learning Company as one of the sponsors and offering copies of the game as prizes for state winners. Plot Carmen Sandiego and her six Master Thieves (Gnash, Madame Le Zaarde, Snarla Swing, Dr. Depth, Count Hypno, and Jane Reaction) have sent KnowBots (SynicBot, HALieBot, Pure-EBot, BruiserBot, DimBot, and Touchy-FezlyBot) to steal the world of its data and information from various texts. In response Acme Agent Chase Devineaux recruits additional agents to counter this worldwide threat. Carmen Sandiego, eager for a challenge awaits the agents. There is no actual end to the game, as after the defeat and capture of Carmen's minions, the game will just restart with them free as if the previous events never happened. Gameplay The object of the game is to get past Carmen's KnowBots and correctly answer questions to capture Carmen's Master Thieves. At the beginning of each mission, Chase Devineaux, the ACME Detective Agency's top agent will describes the suspect and the vital stolen knowledge. There are three difficulty levels, that cater for three age groups respectively and start players with a certain number of Energy Points. KnowBots will try to stop the ACME agent from disabling them (or delay the destruction and automatic surrender of 1/2 of the code that reveals the suspect's location) by challenging them to several Jeopardy!- like rounds of questions in the subject areas of History, Geography, Math, Crime Scene (which is similar to a memory game), English, Life Science, Physical Science, or Art and Music. If the player(s) answer correctly, they gain a certain number of Knowledge Points dependent on the type of question being asked (For example, Multipick questions are worth 950 Knowledge Points and Rapid Fire Sort questions are worth 200 Knowledge Points apiece). If they get a question incorrect, they lose one point of Capture Energy, which is essential to the capture of the Master Thief. Once at the Master Thief's hideout, the player needs to solve a unique puzzle to enter. The game also offers a multiplayer option in which the player can play with friends. There are two types of multiplayer: The players can play cooperatively or competitively. If the player choose to play cooperatively, they will work in teams and score the same number of points if one player answers a question correctly. Whereas in competition, it is vice versa. The player with the most capture energy will have the opportunity to capture the thief, but if there is a tie in capture energy, the player with the most Knowledge Points will have the opportunity to capture the thief. Players also have the option to create their own questions as they wish and up to 50 questions using Multipick, YinYang (True/False), Sequencer, Matchmaker, and Gridlock (Finding all the answers in a graph). Players outwit the KnowBots in a game-show type competition.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/149490806/ Educational goals ThinkQuick is used to \\"test...students' ability to recall information previously taught\\". Players receive points for correct answers. Original content can be created for the game via the custom content creator (and for example inputted by teachers for school quizzes). Information is provided to players in a quiz show format. The multisubject game includes questions about: math, language arts, science, history, geography, and music.HighBeam The game is presented through both competitive and cooperative play modes. It allows up to four players to play at once. Critical reception In a review of a package entitled Adventure Workshop: 4th-6th Grade which featured the games The ClueFinders Reading Adventures Ages 9-12, Carmen Sandiego's ThinkQuick Challenge, and Super Solvers Mission: T.H.I.N.K., Hilary Williams of AllGame said that it is \\"one of those rare compilations where all of the included titles are superb\\", adding that ThinkQuick was \\"another great [Carmen] game that will interest older kids due to its international espionage theme\\" and that the game \\"retains the educational value of previous titles in the series, without losing entertainment value\\". Newsday commented \\"[the game is] great, because four kids can play it together on the computer, and it has more than 1,000 questions in seven subject areas, so you are never bored\\". SuperKids praised the \\"superb graphics\\", \\"intricate storyline\\", and gameplay that would \\"amaze and delight\\" Carmen Sandiego fans, though it may prove tiresome for those who had become tired of the quiz-based gaming genre. Infotech said it was a gaming title of interest. ThinkQuick was selected as one of the games offered for this project where games were donated to the Harmony Public Library for students' learning. Teacher Librarian deemed it \\"another Carmen Sandiego hit\\" and a \\"CD-ROM title of interest\\". The Daily Herald wrote that the \\"high-qualify, easy-to-use\\" title \\"shows why [the Carmen Sandiego] franchise has been so successful\\", praising the gameplay mechanic whereby players are alternating between competing in a trivia contest and cooperatively catching Carmen's crooks. Poughkeepsie Journal thought the game bore similarities to the fast-paced quiz game You Don't Know Jack, and thought the kids who have grown weary of the saccharine \\"Good job\\" would \\"love the edgy attitude of a [KnowBot] challenger who snaps\\" quips like \\"Enjoy your little victory, Blue. It won't last\\". The Cincinnati Enquirer noted that this game saw a costume change from Carmen Sandiego's iconic red dress to a black catsuit. The Straight Times thought the game was \\"exciting and challenging\\". In a negative analysis, Robin Ray of the Boston Herald commented that ThinkQuick was part of a growing trend of gaming franchises in which previous titles which \\"could wholeheartedly [be] recommend[ed]\\", \\"[were not] a complete waste of time\\", and \\"[were] near-perfect combination of fun and learning\\" contrasted greatly with the new releases which instead \\"cause...slow burn\\". She said \\"this is not Think Quick, this is Spit Quick\\". Home Computer Buying Guide said the game had a weaker and less interesting theme than previous Carmen Sandiego titles. Anne Sushko of The Book Report recommended the game as \\"well developed and of high interest\\", though noted that it was not compatible with Windows NT. The Boston Herald gave the game a scathing review, writing that the game has lost the girl customer, that the questions are \\"random, narrow,[and] boring\\", and that \\"the Knowbots sneeringly insult you if you give an incorrect answer\\", concluding that whoever designed the game \\"should be asked to clear off his or her hard drive\\".

The serious candidate - Chandu Lal Sahu of the Bharatiya Janata Party - received 503,514 votes, but his margin of win was just 1,217 votes. The dummy candidates received the votes intended for him, with one of them finishing third in the constituency. To solve this problem, the Election Commission of India is designing Electronic Voting Machines with candidates' photographs. In the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by- election, a minor candidate changed his name to \\"Roy Harold Jenkins\\" to confuse voters looking for Roy H. Jenkins. *A dummy candidate may serve as a placeholder for a party in a primary and then withdraw after winning the primary, allowing the leadership of the party an opportunity to nominate the candidate they really desire to fill their line for the general election. * Dummy candidates can also result from candidates withdrawing from a particular race, but being unable to pull their name off the ballot, remaining listed as a choice.

Though of priestly descent, he was not a member of the Hasmonean dynasty.

He was appointed by Herod to fill the office of high priest made vacant by the death of Antigonus (37 BCE). Ananelus's incumbency was of short duration. Prudence compelled Herod to remove him, and to fill his place with the Hasmonean Aristobulus (36 BCE). The youthful Hasmonean, however, was too popular with the patriotic party; though he was a brother of Mariamne, Herod's beloved wife, he was treacherously drowned at Herod's instigation (35 BCE), and Ananelus was restored to the high position. How long he continued in office historians do not state; but it could not have been for many years, since after the execution of Mariamne (29 BCE) Herod remarried, and appointed his second father-in-law, Simon ben Boethus, to the high-priesthood, removing Joshua ben Fabus.

Her activism helped lead to the 1974 Boldt Decision, for which she was dubbed, \\"the Rosa Parks of the American Indian Movement.\\" She co-founded Women of All Red Nations (WARN) in 1974. The first convening of the Indigenous Women's Network was in her backyard in Yelm, Washington in August 1985.  Ancestry and early life  Born on the Tulalip Reservation on March 30, 1934, Janet Renecker, the oldest of three girls and a descendant of Chief Seattle's family, lived a childhood marked by poverty and alcohol abuse. Throughout her early years, she and her family moved often, from Tulalip to Taholah on the Quinault Reservation and, later, to Seattle's International District. Her stepfather drank and had trouble finding work. She often took refuge in churches and foster homes, spending much of her formative years in the city‚Äîmainly out of touch with tribal customs and traditions. \\"She thought taverns and drinking was the only way in life,\\" Barbara McCloud, her daughter, said. She married and divorced young before meeting a Nisqually tribal fisherman and electrical lineman named Don McCloud in the early 1950s. The couple soon married, and together would have eight children, six girls and two boys.  Fishing rights activism  On Jan. 6, 1962, dozens of Washington State game wardens stormed a group of Indians fishing the Nisqually River, arresting five men, including some of McCloud's relatives, for illegal fishing. \\"When the raid ended after more than eight hours of sorties in wet brush and on the muddy, swollen stream, five Indians had been arrested and charged with \`operating set nets capable of taking game fish.'\\" Despite tribal treaties, such as the Treaty of Medicine Creek of 1854, with the federal government that guaranteed fishing and hunting rights to Indians in their traditional tribal lands and waters, state agents periodically squared off with Native Americans. But as salmon and steelhead numbers began dwindling in the 1960s, the state began exerting more authority over tribal fisheries, attempting to conserve the catch for the commercial- and sport-fishing industries. Injunctions were issued allowing the state to regulate tribal fisheries, and the Washington State Supreme Court upheld them. Indians began mobilizing. The McClouds founded the activist group Survival of American Indians Association. And, in defiance of court orders, members began staging demonstrations dubbed \\"fish-ins\\", the beginning of what would come to be known as the Fish Wars. Joining her husband; his stepbrother, Nisqually tribal member Billy Frank, Jr.; Puyallup Indian Bob Satiacum; and others, Janet McCloud helped organize the protests at the Nisqually River and Puyallup River, into which tribe members cast traditional nets deemed illegal by the state. Invariably, the \\"fish-ins\\" would lead to raids and arrests at the hands of game agents. But the events drew worldwide attention. Indian elders and activists converged on Washington State. Actor Marlon Brando and rights activist Dick Gregory went to Western Washington, joined fish-ins and lent their celebrity to the cause. And the Black Panthers stood side-by-side with Indians in protests at the state Capitol in Olympia. All the while, Janet McCloud documented the struggle as editor of Survival News, a newsletter that presented the natives' side of the fish wars. She found an old mimeograph machine at a local thrift store, brought it home and recruited her children to help. \\"All us kids would be all right here, sorting and stapling all the papers together, late into the night,\\" daughter Sally McCloud recalled. Janet's children also stood on the battle lines. During one famous fish-in at Frank's Landing on the Nisqually on Oct. 13, 1965, a boat carrying several native fishermen, including Janet's husband and two sons, set a tribal net in the river as game wardens lay in waiting. \\"From the other side of the river shouts were heard: 'Get em! Get the dirty S.O.B.s!'\\" McCloud wrote later. \\"In the twinkling of an eye, three big powerboats emerged from the underbrush, were quickly launched and used to ram the Indians' boat.\\" Her son, Jeff McCloud, not yet 10 and a non-swimmer, was dumped in. A scuffle broke out on the shore, where native women and children had gathered peacefully to watch the demonstration. They pelted wardens with debris, while game agents wrestled and beat some of the protesters. \\"If Mom knew that was going to happen, she would've never brought us there,\\" daughter Nancy Shippentower Games said. Six people were arrested, including Don and Janet McCloud. She served six days and refused to eat while incarcerated. Eventually, the Indians' efforts paid off. On Feb. 12, 1974, U.S. District Judge George Boldt ruled in favor of 14 treaty tribes, upholding the language of their treaties that entitled them to half the salmon and steelhead catch in Washington.  Resurrecting Native American spirituality  Along with catapulting her into the status of civil rights leader, the fish wars brought Janet McCloud in touch with her native spirituality. One time, while her husband was jailed for a fish-in, McCloud, who had been a practicing Catholic, experienced a vision at her Yelm home. \\"She couldn't rely on the white man's religion; it was hurting her,\\" her daughter-in-law, Joyce McCloud, recalled. \\"That's when she saw the vision: She was looking out at Mount Rainier, and she saw all the faces of the great chiefs.\\" McCloud believed it to be a calling. In the late 1960s, she met Thomas Banyacya, an internationally known Hopi spiritual interpreter, who taught her to search for answers in peace. She befriended Audrey Shenandoah, an Iroquois Indian and Clan Mother of the Onondaga Nation in New York, and adopted Iroquois religious beliefs on nature. \\"She was always speaking her mind, not backing down for anything,\\" said Tracy Shenandoah, who with his mother came to Yelm to be with McCloud. During the 1970s, McCloud spread the message of native spirituality and human rights worldwide. She traveled the globe, speaking about indigenous women's rights and social justice, and she served as delegate to a national conference on corrections, urging prisons to adopt native spirituality traditions for Indian inmates.  Sapa Dawn Center  Janet McCloud established her home and the surrounding in Yelm, Washington as a retreat, naming it the Sapa Dawn Center, \\"Sapa\\" meaning grandfather, the name a tribute to Don McCloud, who died in April 1985. \\"The elders have said this is a spiritual place. For over 30 years, we've used this land to teach our traditional ways,\\" McCloud, an Indian elder herself, wrote in 1999. \\"When all is going crazy . . . our people can come back to the center to find the calming effect; to reconnect with their spiritual self.\\" Leaders of the American Indian Movement, Dennis Banks, Russell Means, and others, came to Sapa Dawn and its sweat lodge before launching their 1973 at Wounded Knee Occupation in South Dakota.[3] In August 1985, 300 women from many countries found their way to Sapa Dawn to talk about concerns they shared. \\"There was no motel in Yelm then,\\" recalls McCloud. \\"So we put up tepees. One woman said: 'Where's the motel?' I said, 'Here's a key: tepee number one or tepee number two.'\\" The women camped for five days, talking about social, economic and family problems troubling native people throughout the Western Hemisphere. That was the birth of what now is called the Indigenous Women's Network, a coalition championing native women, families and tribal sovereignty from Chile to Canada, and which adopted McCloud as a founding mother.  Yet-Si-Blue  Her uncle, Pete Henry, explained why McCloud's grandmother gave her the Indian name, \\"Yet-Si-Blue,\\" meaning \\"the woman who talks.\\" \\"She had become a spokeswoman for Indian culture. That was the perfect name.\\"  Death  Bedridden and muted by complications from diabetes and high blood pressure in her final weeks, Janet McCloud died on November 25, 2003 at the age of 69, with her family gathered bedside, dressed in traditional garb by her granddaughters, and wrapped in a handmade quilt.

It charts the life of a British family between 1854 and 1945 and their involvement in four wars - the Crimean War, Boer War, First World War and Second World War.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature: Feature Films 1941-50 by The American Film Institute, c.1993 In each era Beresford is in the army and dresses in the uniform of the age in most scenes, even at home. The drama was remade by the BBC as a TV production in 1949, with Patricia Burke as Elizabeth, John Robinson as John Beresford and Cathleen Nesbitt as Mother. Plot Four generations of women (all played by Anna Neagle in the film) have lived in Ladymead, a Georgian mansion, while their husbands are away at war. From the Crimean War to the Second World War, in each case the husband returns home to find his wife more independently minded: the Crimean War wife inspired by the work of Florence Nightingale, the Boer War wife a suffragette and peace activist, and the Great War wife a Jazz Age flapper. The film begins in the Second World War with her officer husband, John Beresford, returning in a Short_Sunderland]. One evening at Ladymead House she faints, suffering concussion after imagining that she is trying to go through a door which is not there. The story jumps to 1854 and a celebration following the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. John Beresford gives a speech. Elizabeth expresses a notion to help as a nurse with Florence Nightingale. They dance to Strauss's Vienna Waltz (technically still unwritten). Once alone Elizabeth plays Greensleeves on the piano for John. He explains the Charge of the Light Brigade to a friend. In the bedroom Elizabeth asks John to leave the army. He says the war is over (?) so there is now no risk. She presses him to run the estate instead. He refuses to change and says he will sleep in the dressing room. Elizabeth weeps next to the four-poster bed. The story moves forward to 1903 as Elizabeth awaits the return of her husband from the Second Boer War. This time John is upset that Elizabeth has been imanaging the estate better than he did. Elizabeth sings Love's Old Sweet Song (\\"Just a Song at Twilight\\") as she plays the piano. Elizabeth shows an interest in politics and suffrage. The story then switches to 1919, after the end of the First World War. John attends major celebrations in the city with crowds singing Auld Lang Syne before going back to Ladymeade, which on arrival he finds unoccupied. His wife, who arrives shortly afterwards with a friend, Wrigley, does as she wishes: smoking cigarettes and dressing as a flapper. Wrigley explains how he avoided enlistment. Beresford, infuriated, throws him out. He and Elizabeth argue. John leaves the room and, in despair at his wife‚Äôs attitude, shoots himself. The story reverts to 1945 and Elizabeth wakes from her faint. They go out dancing and she remembers the women in her dream.

The Sensible Sentencing Trust is a political advocacy group based in Napier, New Zealand. The Trust states its vision as \\"A Safe New Zealand\\" and its mission as \\"to obtain a large base of community support, and ensure safety for all New Zealanders from violent and criminal offending, through education, development of effective penal policies, and the promotion of responsible behaviour, accountable parenting, and respect for each other at all levels of society.\\" The trust was formed by Garth McVicar in 2001 in response to the police prosecution of Mark Middleton for threatening to kill Paul Dally who tortured, raped, and killed Middleton's 13-year-old stepdaughter Karla Cardno in 1989. The trust claimed to have been instrumental in getting major changes in the New Zealand justice system by gaining public and government support for changes including: 1\\\\. Increase in the sentence for murder from 10 years to 17 years in late 2002. https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/sentencing-act- year-1.pdf 2\\\\. Bail reforms (2007) which reversed the onus for bail in cases of violent, sexual and drug offenders who then had to convince the court of their future good behaviour or bail would be declined. The trust claimed public safety would be increased as a result. 3\\\\. A three strikes law (2010) which provided for progressively increased sentencing for repeat offenders within a category of 40 listed violent and sexual offences. The trust claimed increased public safety would result by removing high risk offenders off the streets for longer periods. The trust also began an on-line offender database in early 2002 in response to the refusal by government to undertake this task, in spite of repeated requests to do so. The trust justified the decision to launch its own offender database because it said that members of the public (with some emphasis on parents and children), needed to be able to keep themselves and their children safe from violent and sexual predators and knowing who and where they were was essential knowledge to do that. In 2010, the Trust's tax-free charitable status was revoked by the Charities Commission, on the grounds that it had become a political lobby group rather than a charity. This was contested by the Trust, following which the Trust split into two separate trusts. (1) The Sensible Sentencing Trust (SST) which advocates on behalf of victims of serious violent and/or sexual crime and homicide in New Zealand. SST is a registered charitable trust which does not have donee status with the Inland Revenue Department. (2) The Sensible Sentencing Group Trust (SSGT) which serves to educate the public as to the plight of victims and to ensure such victims and their families are fully aware of their rights and entitlements, providing both education and practical support during their time of trauma. SSGT is a registered charitable trust which has donee status with the Inland Revenue Department. The Trust was a registered electoral promoter at the 2011 general election. The Trust did not register as a promoter for the 2014 general election, but founder McVicar contended the electorate and the party list as a member of the Conservative Party. In 2018, the Privacy Commissioner warned that the trust had called the wrong man a paedophile for almost two years and said the trust had a continuously negligent, cavalier, and dangerous approach to privacy.https://privacy.org.nz/news-and-publications/statements-media- releases/naming-sensible-sentencing-trust/ After a similar instance of mistaken identity in 2014, the trust agreed to provide training to volunteers, but only one person was trained and they left shortly after.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/109488195/negligent-cavalier-sensible- sentencing-trust-wrongly-labels-man-a-paedophile References External links * Sensible Sentencing Trust Category:Crime in New Zealand Category:Political advocacy groups in New Zealand Category:2001 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Sensible Sentencing Trust"},{"id":"23149190","text":"A written ministerial statement is, in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a statement by a Minister that puts the day-to-day business of government in the public domain.

The Movie Scene made reference to Kiefer Sutherland's role in the television series 24, writing that \\"even Jack Bauer couldn't rescue this\\". They noted that the film suffered from a tight budget, with limited locations and scenery that were \\"unbelievably fake\\", and that the film's use of quick cut-aways made the storyline seem disjointed.

The greatest problems of the film were seen in its weak plot and poor dialogue, but this could have been averted had the supporting characters been given more depth. Apart from Sutherland, the only major name in the film who managed to make any impact was Henry Winkler in his role as airport engineer John Quinn.

He went to tell Buchanan that the film was going to be postponed; Buchanan was playing in a show Stand Up and Sing with Anna Neagle. Wilcox was impressed by Neagle and cast her at a fee of ¬£150. The film was shot in three weeks before Buchanan had to leave to appear in Stand Up and Sing at Liverpool. During the making of the film, Wilcox and Neagle fell in love Reception The film was Wilcox's most commercially successful until that time.

On September 1, 1961, at 02:05 CDT, the flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Midway Airport (ICAO: KMDW) in Chicago, killing all 73 passengers and five crew on board; it was at the time the deadliest single plane disaster in U.S. history. The accident was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which concluded its probable cause was the loss of a 5/16 inch bolt which fell out of the elevator control mechanism during the climb from Chicago, resulting in an abrupt pitch up followed by a stall and crash. Flight history The four-engine propliner originated in Boston, and after making intermediate stops in New York and Pittsburgh, arrived at Chicago Midway Airport at 01:18 CST, where a new crew took over, and fuel and oil were added. At 02:00 the flight departed from runway 22, bound for Las Vegas, Nevada, the next stop. Five minutes later, while climbing westbound to 5,000 ft, the aircraft suddenly pitched violently upwards, resulting in an accelerated stall from which the crew was unable to recover. The aircraft crashed into terrain, and left a debris field of 200 by 1,100 feet. Investigation Schematic of elevator boost linkage mechanism, showing location of missing bolt (A) The CAB investigated the accident, and as the wreckage pieces were reassembled and scrutinized, it became apparent that a critical 5/16 inch AN-175-21 nickel steel bolt was missing in the elevator boost linkage mechanism. By carefully examining and analyzing the various scuff marks and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not as a result of the accident itself. Without the bolt in place, the elevator (when in boost mode) and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the accident sequence. The design of the Lockheed Constellation L-049 aircraft allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible.The actual wording from the CAB's final report is: \\"With the elevator at its maximum deflection (maximum hinge-moment or 40 degrees, depending on speed) and held there by full hydraulic pressure and with forward (nose-down) force on the column, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to move the shift handle far enough to operate the shutoff and/or the bypass valves.\\" Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control. On December 18, 1962, the CAB published its final report on the accident, concluding that the probable cause was \\"... the loss of an AN-175-21 nickel steel bolt from the parallelogram linkage of the elevator boost system, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft.\\" Aftermath As a result of their investigation of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator boost control, so that the shift to manual mode could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying nose down pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the aircraft's flight manual, but did not require any design changes.

The Faule Grete (German for Lazy Grete, alluding to the lack of mobility and slow rate of fire of such super-sized cannon) was a medieval large-calibre cannon of the Teutonic Order. The bronze bombard was cast in 1409 in the cannon foundry of the Marienburg by the gunfounder Heynrich Dumechen. According to the account books of the order, the construction costs amounted to 278.5 Mark, a sum equivalent to ca. 1160 oxen. Borrowed by Margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg in 1413, the cannon was instrumental in breaking the opposition of the domestic knighthood within three weeks, allowing Fredrick to lay the foundation for the rise of his Hohenzollern dynasty which later came to rule Prussia and the Deutsches Reich.

Following Regent Arran's defeat at the battle of Pinkie Cleugh on Saturday 10 September 1547, he took Haddington, with 5000 troops including French mercenaries and troops sent by Henry II of France to bolster the Auld Alliance. Afterwards, Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury took it with nearly 15,000. The English forces built artillery fortifications and were able to withstand an assault by the besieging French and Scots troops supported by heavy cannon in July 1548. Although the siege was scaled down after this unsuccessful attempt, the English garrison abandoned the town on 19 September 1549, after attrition by Scottish raids at night, sickness, and changing political circumstance. The English dig in The English commander, Grey of Wilton, captured and garrisoned Haddington and outlying villages by 23 February 1548. The garrison included 200 Albanian Stratioti who had previously fought in the French army.Jean de Beagu√©, History of the Campaigns in 1548 and 1549, (1707), p.38 At the end of February 1548, Regent Arran brought four cannon to besiege and take the East Lothian houses of Ormiston, Brunstane, and Saltoun which John Cockburn of Ormiston and Alexander Crichton of Brunstane held for England, and summoned the men of Stirling, Menteith, and Strathearn to the field.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), pp. 150‚Äì151, 153. Grey and Thomas Palmer began to fortify the town in earnest after 24 April 1548. The English strategy was for the siege of Haddington to consume Scottish and French resources.Merriman, Marcus, Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), pp. 313‚Äì314. The soldiers built the fortifications alongside labourers from England who were called 'pioneers.' Timber was brought from the woods of Broun of Colstoun. Although the site had obvious drawbacks, overlooked by the ridge of the nearby Garleton Hills and four miles from the sea, the finished ramparts were much admired. Local landowners unwilling to collaborate had to relocate. George Seton, 6th Lord Seton and his French wife Marie Pieris moved from their home at Seton Palace to Culross Abbey.Richard Maitland, History of the House of Seytoun (Glasgow, 1829), p. 42. The French ambassador in London, Odet de Selve, heard from a French mercenary serving on the English side that it was almost as impregnable as Turin.Merriman, Marcus, History of the King's Works, vol. 4 part 2 (London, 1982), 718‚Äì719. Somerset even showed Odet de Selve the plan, and said it was better than Calais. The design include four corner bastions, called Bowes, Wyndham, Taylor, and Tiberio, after the commanders. Francisco Tiberio was the leader of a company of Italian mercenaries. The French ambassador was told that the tollbooth, a tall and solid stone structure, had been filled with earth to form a gun platform called a cavalier.Merriman, Marcus, (1982), 719‚Äì721: Correspondance politique de Odet de Selve, 52, 366. English pioneers digging the town ditch found curious ancient coins on 7 June which Grey of Wilton sent to Somerset for their strangeness.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p.117 (ancient coins), p.118 (timber) Grey of Wilton sent 100 Spanish soldiers with their commander Pero Negro to join the garrison at the end of June 1548, but they encountered the enemy and rode to Berwick instead.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 131-3. Sieges Sir James Wilsford Nungate bridge: Haddington is bounded by the River Tyne to the south and west French and Scottish troops began to seriously besiege the town in July 1548. It was defended by Sir James Wilford. The Master of the Scottish Artillery, Lord Methven, organised guns to be brought from the siege of Broughty Castle in June. These guns were shipped to Aberlady, the nearest haven on the Forth. The great Scottish gun 'thrawinmouth' from Dunbar Castle was also deployedAccounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), 216. and the cannons from Broughty were placed on 3 July 1548.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 136. On 5 July Methven gave Mary of Guise an optimistic report of the damage caused to the English defences by his guns. His fire had demolished the Tollbooth within the town, and he had advanced trenches towards the ramparts.Cameron, Annie I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), 248‚Äì250. Mary of Guise came to view the progress of the siege on 9 July 1548 and her party came in range of the English guns. Sixteen of her entourage were killed around her and she was terror-stricken.Bain, Joseph, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2, Edinburgh (1892) 602‚Äì604, Palmer & Holcroft to Somerset, 11 July 1548, (& various primary sources) At this time the English inside were countermining against the French and Scottish siegeworks. A Scots force joined the French troops on 16 July to storm the town but were driven away by cannon fire.Calendar of State Papers Spain, vol. 9 (London, 1912), 569‚Äì570. Following this set-back, the French officer d'Ess√© ordered the heavy guns to be withdrawn on 17 July. With rumours of English reinforcement, Methven took the Scottish and French guns to Edinburgh and Leith, while d'Ess√© kept the camp. D'Ess√© made his feelings known to Arran; that an earlier decisive assault before the English had time to entrench would have been the best action.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), 245, 249‚Äì251. The English military engineer, Thomas Pettit, Surveyor of Calais, was captured and taken to Edinburgh to be held for ransom by Andr√© de Montalembert.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 150, 153-4. Shrewsbury arrived on 23 August 1548 with an army close in size to the English army at Pinkie. The French and Scots abandoned their siege of Haddington and retired to Edinburgh and Leith.Merriman, Marcus, Rough Wooings, (2000), 321. Edward VI was told that some of the departing besiegers had spoken to Captain Tiberio. They had pointed out the inadequacies of the fortifications and said all honour was due to the defenders and none to themselves. Edward also recorded a subsequent large but unsuccessful night raid against Haddington.Jordan, W. K., The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI, George Unwin & Allen (1966), 10. The French troops in Edinburgh started a fight in Edinburgh in October 1548 over a culverin sent for repair and several Scots were killed on the Royal Mile.Teulet, A., Relations politiques de la France et de l'Espagne avec l'√âcosse au XVIe si√®cle, vol. 1 (1862), 230; also in Knox, John, History of the Reformation, Bk. 2. D'Ess√© organised a night raid on Haddington to increase their popularity. The raid was repulsed after the English watch shouted, \\"Bows and Bills\\", which according to John Knox was the usual alarm of the time. While the French were away from Edinburgh the townsfolk killed some of their wounded.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooing, Tuckwell, (2000), 321: Knox, John, History of the Reformation, book 1, e.g., Lennox, Cuthbert, ed., (1905), 105‚Äì107. On 1 November 1548, Wilford wrote to Somerset describing the state of Haddington, with a garrison stricken by plague: > \\"The state of this town pities me both to see and to write it; but I hope > for relief. Many are sick and a great number dead, most of the plague. On my > faith there are not here this day of horse, foot, and Italians, 1000 able to > go to the walls, and more like to be sick, than the sick to mend, who watch > the walls every 5th night, yet the walls are un-manned.\\"Calendar State > Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 165‚Äì166. English withdraw Mar√©chal Paul de Thermes, after Fran√ßois Clouet, 1554. The English withdrew because they were out of supplies, many of their men had died from disease or during the Scottish night raids, and more French re- inforcements had arrived under Paul de Thermes. The English (and their mercenary forces, which included German and Spanish professional soldiers) evacuated Haddington on 19 September 1549, travelling overland to Berwick upon Tweed. Mary of Guise was triumphant.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 344‚Äì345.

Hilwie Hamdon was the first woman to talk to Edmonton Mayor John Fry about purchasing land to construct the mosque. She, along with friends, collected fund from Jews, Christians and Muslims to construct the mosque. The mosque was built by Ukrainian-Canadian contractor Mike Drewoth in a style resembling the Eastern Christian (Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox) immigrant churches and opened on December 12, 1938. In the 1940s, the building was relocated from its original site to a location a few blocks away to make room for a school expansion. By the 1980s, the mosque been outgrown by the booming Muslim community, and had fallen into disrepair. The city, which owned the land on which it was located, was contemplating demolition of the site to expand a hospital. But in 1991, it was decided to move the mosque to Fort Edmonton Park at a cost of $75,000. About a year later on May 28, 1992, it was reopened in the park.

In these models, the universe starts with a Big Bang and expands for some time, with increasing entropy and a thermodynamic arrow of time pointing in the direction of the expansion. After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density Big Crunch. There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and causation in general.

The building, located along Gougler Avenue in central Kent near the Cuyahoga River, was built in 1837 and has served as the seat of government for Franklin Township since 1840. It is best known for being the location where James A. Garfield was nominated for his first political office in 1859. History The building was built in 1837 as an office for the Franklin Silk Company, which had been started on the belief that Kent (then known as Franklin Mills) would become a manufacturing center for the silk industry. This proved incorrect and the Panic of 1837 combined with northeast Ohio's unfavorable climate for silkworms led to the business failing. Franklin Township then purchased the building and finished it in 1840 to serve as the home of the township government. =James A. Garfield= On August 23, 1859, the hall was the site of a local Republican Party convention to nominate a state senator. The meeting produced a deadlock, and so to break it, James A. Garfield, who had not held any political office up to that point, was nominated.Grismer, p. 31 Garfield would go on to win the election as the state senator for an area which included Portage and Summit counties. =Other uses= Franklin Township Hall would serve as home to several schools in Kent's history, including a small private school beginning in 1857 prior to the establishment of a public school system. In the fall of 1868 through March 1869 the building was the first home of Kent High School due to construction delays on the new Union school building one block west.Grismer, p. 192 The second floor was later used as a school, known as \\"Riverview School\\" or \\"River Street School\\", for fifth and sixth graders during the late 1910s due to overcrowding at the other Kent public schools. From 1953‚Äì1978 the building was the location of the offices for the Kent City School District. During that time, the building was heavily damaged by a fire in 1971 which caused US$20,000 in damage.Darrow, p. 17 The hall also served as a meeting place for some of Kent's religious bodies including early meetings of the local Roman Catholic parish from 1862‚Äì1868 and the Universalist Church from 1866‚Äì1868.Grismer, pp. 198‚Äì199 It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1975.

It is one of the fastest developing cities in southern Africa. Lusaka is in the southern part of the central plateau at an elevation of about . , the city's population was about 1.7 million, while the urban population is estimated at 2.5 million in 2018. Lusaka is the centre of both commerce and government in Zambia and connects to the country's four main highways heading north, south, east and west. English is the official language of the city administration, while Nyanja and Bemba are the commonly spoken street languages.

In the Nyanja language, Manda means \\"graveyard.\\" The area was expanded by European (mainly British) settlers in 1905 with the building of the railway. Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 167 In 1935, due to its fairly central location, its situation on the railway and at the crossroads of the Great North Road and Great East Road, it was chosen to replace Livingstone as the capital of the British colony of Northern Rhodesia. Britannica, Lusaka, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 30 June 2019 After the federation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia in 1953, it was a centre of the independence movement amongst some of the educated elite that led to the creation of the Republic of Zambia. In 1964, Lusaka became the capital of the newly independent Zambia. In recent years, Lusaka has become a popular urban settlement for Zambians and tourists alike. Its central nature and fast growing infrastructure sector have increased donor confidence and as such Zambians are seeing signs of development in the form of job creation, housing, etc. Consequently, it is thought that with proper and effective economic reforms, Lusaka as well as Zambia as a whole will develop considerably.

Nobel economist Robert Lucas proposed measuring the cost of business cycles as the percentage increase in consumption that would be necessary to make a representative consumer indifferent between a smooth, non-fluctuating, consumption trend and one that is subject to business cycles. Under the assumptions that business cycles represent random shocks around a trend growth path, Robert Lucas argued that the cost of business cycles is extremely small, and as a result the focus of both academic economists and policy makers on economic stabilization policy rather than on long term growth has been misplaced. Lucas himself, after calculating this cost back in 1987, reoriented his own macroeconomic research program away from the study of short run fluctuations. However, Lucas' conclusion is controversial. In particular, Keynesian economists typically argue that business cycles should not be understood as fluctuations above and below a trend. Instead, they argue that booms are times when the economy is near its potential output trend, and that recessions are times when the economy is substantially below trend, so that there is a large output gap. Under this viewpoint, the welfare cost of business cycles is larger, because an economy with cycles not only suffers more variable consumption, but also lower consumption on average.  Basic intuition  Compensating an individual for volatility in consumption (click to enlarge) If we consider two consumption paths, each with the same trend and the same initial level of consumption ‚Äì and as a result same level of consumption per period on average ‚Äì but with different levels of volatility, then, according to economic theory, the less volatile consumption path will be preferred to the more volatile one. This is due to risk aversion on part of individual agents. One way to calculate how costly this greater volatility is in terms of individual (or, under some restrictive conditions, social) welfare is to ask what percentage of her annual average consumption would an individual be willing to sacrifice in order to eliminate this volatility entirely. Another way to express this is by asking how much an individual with a smooth consumption path would have to be compensated in terms of average consumption in order to accept the volatile path instead of the one without the volatility. The resulting amount of compensation, expressed as a percentage of average annual consumption, is the cost of the fluctuations calculated by Lucas. It is a function of people's degree of risk aversion and of the magnitude of the fluctuations which are to be eliminated, as measured by the standard deviation of the natural log of consumption.  Lucas' formula  Robert Lucas' baseline formula for the welfare cost of business cycles is given by (see mathematical derivation below): : \\\\lambda=\\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\sigma^2 \\\\theta where \\\\lambda is the cost of fluctuations (the % of average annual consumption that a person would be willing to pay to eliminate all fluctuations in her consumption), \\\\sigma is the standard deviation of the natural log of consumption and \\\\theta measures the degree of relative risk aversion. It is straightforward to measure \\\\sigma from available data. Using US data from between 1947 and 2001 Lucas obtained \\\\sigma=.032. It is a little harder to obtain an empirical estimate of \\\\theta; although it should be theoretically possible, many controversies in economics revolve around the precise and appropriate measurement of this parameter. However it is doubtful that \\\\theta is particularly high (most estimates are no higher than 4). As an illustrative example consider the case of log utility (see below) in which case \\\\theta=1. In this case the welfare cost of fluctuations is : \\\\lambda=\\\\frac {1} {2} (.032)^2 = .0005 . In other words, eliminating all the fluctuations from a person's consumption path (i.e., eliminating the business cycle entirely) is worth only 1/20 of 1 percent of average annual consumption. For example, an individual who consumes $50,000 worth of goods a year on average would be willing to pay only $25 to eliminate consumption fluctuations. The implication is that, if the calculation is correct and appropriate, the ups and downs of the business cycles, the recessions and the booms, hardly matter for individual and possibly social welfare. It is the long run trend of economic growth that is crucial. If \\\\theta is at the upper range of estimates found in literature, around 4, then : \\\\lambda=\\\\frac {1} {2} (.032)^2 4 = .002 or 1/5 of 1 percent. An individual with average consumption of $50,000 would be willing to pay $100 to eliminate fluctuations. This is still a very small amount compared to the implications of long run growth on income. One way to get an upper bound on the degree of risk aversion is to use the Ramsey model of intertemporal savings and consumption. In that case, the equilibrium real interest rate is given by : r = \\\\rho +\\\\theta g where r is the real (after tax) rate of return on capital (the real interest rate), \\\\rho is the subjective rate of time preference (which measures impatience) and g is the annual growth rate of consumption. r is generally estimated to be around 5% (.05) and the annual growth rate of consumption is about 2% (.02). Then the upper bound on the cost of fluctuations occurs when \\\\theta is at its highest, which in this case occurs if \\\\rho=0. This implies that the highest possible degree of risk aversion is : \\\\theta^{Max}=r/g=.05/.02=2.5 which in turn, combined with estimates given above, yields a cost of fluctuations as : \\\\lambda=\\\\frac {1} {2} (.032)^2 2.5 = .0013 which is still extremely small (13% of 1%).  Mathematical representation and formula  Lucas sets up an infinitely lived representative agent model where total lifetime utility (U) is given by the present discounted value (with \\\\beta representing the discount factor) of per period utilities (u(.)) which in turn depend on consumption in each period (c_t) : U=\\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty \\\\beta^t u(c_t) In the case of a certain consumption path, consumption in each period is given by : c_t^{cert}=A e^{gt} where A is initial consumption and g is the growth rate of consumption (neither of these parameters turns out to matter for costs of fluctuations in the baseline model, so they can be normalized to 1 and 0 respectively). In the case of a volatile, uncertain consumption path, consumption in each period is given by : c_t^{vol}=(1+\\\\lambda) A e^{gt} e^{-\\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\sigma^2} \\\\epsilon_t where \\\\sigma is the standard deviation of the natural log of consumption and \\\\epsilon is a random shock which is assumed to be log-normally distributed so that the mean of ln (\\\\epsilon_t) is zero, which in turn implies that the expected value of e^{-\\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\sigma^2} \\\\epsilon_t is 1 (i.e., on average, volatile consumption is same as certain consumption). In this case \\\\lambda is the \\"compensation parameter\\" which measures the percentage by which average consumption has to be increased for the consumer to be indifferent between the certain path of consumption and the volatile one. \\\\lambda is the cost of fluctuations. We find this cost of fluctuations by setting : \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty \\\\beta^t u(c_t^{cert}) = \\\\sum_{t=0}^\\\\infty \\\\beta^t u(c_t^{vol}) and solving for \\\\lambda For the case of isoelastic utility, given by :u(c_t) = \\\\frac{c_t^{1-\\\\theta}-1}{1-\\\\theta} we can obtain an (approximate) closed form solution which has already been given above :\\\\lambda=\\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\sigma^2 \\\\theta A special case of the above formula occurs if utility is logarithmic, u(c_t)=ln(c_t) which corresponds to the case of \\\\theta=1, which means that the above simplifies to \\\\lambda=.5 \\\\sigma^2. In other words, with log utility the cost of fluctuations is equal to one half the variance of the natural logarithm of consumption. An alternative, more accurate solution gives losses that are somewhat larger, especially when volatility is large.Latty (2011) A note on the relationship between the Atkinson index and the Generalised entropy class of decomposable inequality indexes under the assumption of log-normality of income distribution or volatility, https://www.academia.edu/1816869/A_note_on_the_relationship_between_the_Atkinson_index_and_the_generalised_entropy_class_of_decomposable_inequality_indexes_under_the_assumption_of_log- normality_of_income_distribution_or_volatility  Risk aversion and the equity premium puzzle  However, a major problem related to the above way of estimating \\\\theta (hence \\\\lambda) and in fact, possibly to Lucas' entire approach is the so-called equity premium puzzle, first observed by Mehra and Prescott in 1985. The analysis above implies that since macroeconomic risk is unimportant, the premium associated with systematic risk, that is, risk in returns to an asset that is correlated with aggregate consumption should be small (less than 0.5 percentage points for the values of risk aversion considered above). In fact the premium has averaged around six percentage points. In a survey of the implications of the equity premium, Simon Grant and John Quiggin note that 'A high cost of risk means that recessions are extremely destructive'.  Evidence from effects on subjective wellbeing  Justin Wolfers has shown that macroeconomic volatility reduces subjective wellbeing; the effects are somewhat larger than expected under the Lucas approach. According to Wolfers, 'eliminating unemployment volatility would raise well-being by an amount roughly equal to that from lowering the average level of unemployment by a quarter of a percentage point'.

The film, based on a true story, deals with anorexia nervosa. Lead actress Tracey Gold was actually recovering from the disease while making the movie and used her own life experience for the portrayal of Nancy.Trivia: For the Love of Nancy (1994) Internet Movie Database Plot Nancy Walsh is a high school graduate who is apprehensive about the future. After losing weight after having her wisdom teeth removed, she notices changes in her body and becomes obsessed with her physical appearance. When she begins college, she becomes withdrawn and remains conscious about her weight. She embarks upon a regimented exercising routine, hardly eats and rarely interacts with anybody. At college, she spends most of her time in her room, where she obsesses about keeping her living space in meticulous order. Although most of her friends, neighbors and brother Tommy notice that she is losing a lot of weight, her mother ignores the changes in Nancy. Her brother Patrick is the first one to confront her about it and at a Christmas party, everyone is shocked by how thin she looks. They confront her and she promises them that everything is going to be okay. Her mother, Sally believes her, but her uncle convinces her that if they remain complacent, Nancy could die. Soon, Nancy admits to being anorexic, revealing that she does not know how to stop the disorder. She is reluctant to be taken to the hospital, but Sally is keen for her to get help to ultimately recover. She enters a group session, but feels she doesn't belong there. Nevertheless, she refuses to eat and even goes as far as hiding food, to fake her progress. She is soon caught, and the doctor decides to connect her to a feeding tube. After a while, she makes progress, gaining six pounds. This upsets her, and because she is over eighteen, she is able to sign herself out of the hospital. Upon her return home, she continues starving herself, much to the distress of her mother. When she finds plates with food under her bed, she confronts her and realizes that Nancy is lying. Nancy resists any attempts at help and doesn't even respond when she is forced to eat. Her mother asks her in tears why she is doing it, but she doesn't explain. Tommy is afraid that she will soon die. Meanwhile, she becomes extremely sick from malnutrition, and is eventually hospitalized because of a kidney disease. Her parents feel that they can't do anything but watch her die. Desperate, Sally decides to go to Dr. Partana to ask how their family can help Nancy. The doctor informs Sally that Nancy needs to have someone become her medical guardian. Tom, Nancy's father, decides to go to court against Nancy for the guardianship. Realizing that her parents are only trying to help her, Nancy gives in and lets her father become her guardian. Tom sends Nancy back to the hospital, where Nancy admits having anorexia nervosa and in the end gains weight and starts to regain a normal life. She now feels open to talk about her anorexia.

At West Point he served as the Brigade Adjutant for the Corps of Cadets and was awarded the Silver Medal from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturing and Commerce. After graduation, he served in the U.S. Army for five years, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, attaining the rank of Captain, and earned an MBA from the University of Utah in 1978. Upon leaving the military he received the Meritorious Service Medal. Career Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid meeting with Veterans Affairs nominee Robert McDonald on July 16, 2014 McDonald joined Procter & Gamble in 1980. He served as a brand manager for Tide from 1984‚Äì1986. In 1989 he transferred to Toronto to lead P&G;'s Canadian Laundry business, and moved to the Philippines as General Manager in 1991. In 1995 he became Vice President, Laundry & Cleaning Products Asia, and relocated to Japan. A year later in 1996, McDonald became President, Japan Operations, and in 1999, President, Northeast Asia. Two years later he moved to Brussels as President, Global Fabric Care and later President, Global Fabric & Home Care. He was appointed Vice Chairman, Global Operations in 2004 and appointed Chief Operating Officer in July 2007. McDonald became President and Chief Executive on July 1, 2009. He assumed the Chairman of the Board role January 1, 2010. During his tenure, investors criticized McDonald for being too loyal to P&G; traditions, being too slow to pursue layoffs and other cuts, and being unable to produce new product innovations, particularly compared to his predecessor and replacement A.G. Lafley. He resigned from P&G; on June 30, 2013, following pressure from the company board and activist investors such as Bill Ackman; he was replaced by his predecessor A.G. Lafley, who returned from retirement. In 2014 McDonald led a community-based task force to help the city of Cincinnati renovate its Museum Center. As a result of this work, the Hamilton County Commissioners added a tax levy known as Issue 8 to the ballot in the fall of 2014 which passed, adding an additional sales tax to assist in paying for the renovations. McDonald is on the boards of RallyPoint, Quotient Technology, and Partnership for Public Service. McDonald is the founder of the McDonald Conference for Leaders of Character. =U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs= McDonald in 2019. McDonald succeeded Eric Shinseki, who resigned on May 30, 2014, due to the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. On July 7, 2014, U.S. President Obama nominated McDonald to the Cabinet position of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs.McDonald nominated as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, whitehouse.gov; accessed February 24, 2015. Obama cited McDonald's business background with P&G; and experience revitalizing organizations in his decision. Obama said, \\"[W]hat especially makes Bob the right choice to lead the VA now is his three decades of experience in building and managing one of the world's most recognized companies, Procter & Gamble. The VA is not a business, but it is one of our largest departments... And the workload at the VHA alone is enormous...\\" Obama added, \\"Bob is an expert at making organizations better. In his career he's taken over struggling business units... putting an end to what doesn't work; adopting the best practices that do; restructuring, introducing innovations, making operations more efficient and effective. In short, he's about delivering better results.\\" McDonald was approved by the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the full Senate by unanimous vote.Senate committee unanimously supports McDonald confirmation as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, veterans.senate.gov; accessed February 24, 2015. One of McDonald's first decisions in September 2014 was to increase salaries for physicians and dentists to close the pay gap with the private sector and to make VA an employer of choice. McDonald personally visited several medical schools to recruit new medical personnel in the early months of his tenure at VA. As of June 2015, VA had increased onboard staff by more 12,000 including over 1,000 physicians, 2,700 nurses, and 4,600 other select critical occupations. A major goal of McDonald was the reduction of homelessness among veterans. During his tenure, McDonald directed the VA to build new housing for disabled and elderly veterans and for female veterans with children. As of June 2019, the \\"master plan\\" for a housing first model McDonald wrote remains under construction, to be installed at the West Los Angeles campus of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Privatization McDonald opposed privatization of the VA. \\"I\`ve never met a veteran who wants to privatize the VA,\\" McDonald said. Privatization advocates usually have a stake in privatization, he said. The private sector couldn't absorb the 9 million veterans, with all their comorbidities, in the VA system. The VA trains 70% of the doctors in the country, and has relationships with 1,800 medical schools. Veteran's groups wanted McDonald to stay, but after a long delay, president Donald Trump replaced him with David Shulkin, who also opposed privatization, and was also replaced.Jackson withdraws from nomination for VA Secretary. Interview with Robert McDonald, former secretary. By Rachel Maddow. The Rachel Maddow Show. MSNBC. April 26, 2018 Controversies On February 23, 2015, McDonald admitted he misspoke trying to engage a homeless veteran on January 30, 2015, about his serving in the U.S. Army Special Forces, a conversation that was recorded by a CBS television news crew accompanying him during a nationwide count of homeless veterans. \\"I have no excuse, I was not in the special forces\\" he told The Huffington Post, which first broke the story. The Huffington Post reported that \\"special operations forces\\" includes the Army Rangers and that McDonald \\"completed Army Ranger training and took courses in jungle, arctic and desert warfare. He qualified as a senior parachutist and airborne jumpmaster, and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division until he resigned his commission in 1980.

This statement was viewed as both insensitive to patients and incorrect, as Disney does measure wait times. He apologized the next day. Personal life In July 2020, McDonald was appointed by the George W. Bush Institute as the April and Jay Graham Fellow where he serves as a key member of the Military Service Initiative team. In September 2020, McDonald was selected by presidential nominee Joe Biden to be a member of his transition team's advisory board. McDonald donated a statue of General Ulysses S.

It is commonly reported to present on the trunk and extremities and behave in an aggressive manner. MCS is a cancerous subtype of its benign counterpart, chondroid syringoma, and is the least common variation that has an approximated prevalence of less that 0.005%. These tumours mainly arise \\"from sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and ectopic salivary glands\\" (Tural, Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013) and are rarely encountered in radiopathological and clinical practice. The tumours commonly appear with an asymptomatic \\"slow-growing, painless, solid subcutaneous or intradermal nodules with a normal margin\\" (Obaidat, Alsaad, and Ghazarian, 2007) and make up for less than one percent of all primary skin tumours. Commonly appearing in the limbs and body, these asymmetrical tumours range from two millimetres to more than three centimetres. MCS is one of the rarest subtypes of tumours and usually requires aggressive surgery to terminate. Despite accounting for only a small number of tumours recorded each year, malignant mixed tumours are easily confused with other skin conditions (such as epidermal cyst, pilar cyst, calcifying epithelioma, or a solitary trichoepithelioma (Tural, Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013)) and have high potential for recurrence after surgical excision. The aggressiveness of malignant chondroid syringoma varies, as 49% of cases have had local recurrence whereas some demonstrate regional lymph node or osseous metastasis. The rare neoplasms generally do not follow a determinate development path and are often difficult to diagnose. Histologically, these malignant mixed tumours have epithelial and mesenchymal components and are very large, nodular, circumscribed, and nonulcerated. They are morphologically identical to pleomorphic adenoma and have a female predilection. They range from developing deep dermal to subcutaneous nodules and metastasise at a very high rate. Malignant mixed tumours can emerge \\"de nova or more rarely develop from a cartilaginous syringoma.\\"(IADVL, 2004)  Causes  Currently malignant mixed tumours do not have a definitive predisposing factor; however, prior physical injury has been proposed as a potential risk for the emergence of these tumours. Chondroid syringoma less than three centimetres are shown to have a heightened risk of malignancy. Other critical indicators include excessive mucoid matrix, ‚Äì a connective tissue tumour with a myxoid background that is composed of \\"clear, mucoid substance ‚Äì numerous mitoses, and poorly differentiated chondroid components.\\" (Metzler, Schaumburg-Lever, Hornstein, and Rassner, 1996)  Diagnosis  Diagnosing malignant mixed tumours is difficult as there many types of tumours and their variants. Malignant chondroid syringoma is particularly challenging to distinguish from other skin tumours as it is prone to the absence of definitive symptoms and an ambiguous clinical presentation. Some signs that help determine diagnosis of malignancy include: \\"mitosis, nuclear atypia, pleomorphism, lymphatic invasion, and local recurrence\\" (IADVL, 2004). Though it is usually found within women in the forties, the youngest-recorded case was fourteen years old and the oldest was eighty-six. The tumour is described as invasive and is clinically characterised by faster growth than the benign chondroid syringoma. They can generally be diagnosed when presenting \\"an epithelial component, eccrine or apocrine differentiation and myoepithelial component of fluctuating prominence\\" (IADVL, 2004). Diagnosis is recommended to follow microscopic analysis to ensure correct examination.  Treatment  There currently is no established guideline for the standardised treatment of malignant chondroid syringomas, due to their rarity. However, the efficacy of treatment for malignant mixed tumours depends on the time of diagnosis. An immediate and broad surgical excision \\"with clear margins\\" (Tural, Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013) is considered curative and to be the most successful treatment. This treatment aims for the most efficacious disease control. It is largely agreed that chemotherapy and radiotherapy are ineffective yet are sometimes still recommended, yet radiotherapy reacts positively to skeletal metastasis. Combination chemotherapy for MCS is reported as unbeneficial. MCS is reported to have a high and continual risk of recurrence of metastasis, some patients experiencing metastasis nearly twenty years after the primary examination. Thus this necessitates consistent clinical follow-up in order to maintain a benign state of the tumour and achieve disease control.  Prognosis  Malignant mixed tumours have a poor prognosis that is deemed unpredictable due to its spread being lymphatic or blood-borne. As there have only been a limited number of cases that have been reported, prognostic points are challenging to confirm, however mainly \\"include size, histological type, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis\\" (Garcia, Atun, and Fernando, 2016). The outcome of the prognosis is dependent on early diagnosis and complete resection. The standard duration between diagnosis and reappearance was \\"23 months, 50 months, and 66 months for local recurrence, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis, [respectively]\\" (Watarai, Amoh, Aki, Takasu, Katsuoka, 2011). In terms of prognosis regarding recorded patients, \\"27% of patients died from their disease.\\"(Tural, Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013) As early as \\"nine weeks\\"( Malik, Saxena, and Kamath, 2013) succeeding clinical surgeries, had reports of patients' deaths been recorded. It has also been recorded that \\"one patient survived twelve years after their diagnosis.\\"(Ka, Gnangnon, and Diouf, 2016) The tumour has a \\"60% rate of metastasis and mortality in the order of 25%\\" (Ka, Gnangnon, and Diouf, 2016) with the highest recordings of metastases being found in \\"lymph nodes and lung and less commonly, bone and brain.\\" (Ka, Gnangnon, and Diouf, 2016)  Recorded Cases  = Facial localisation of a malignant chondroid syringoma = A 34-year- old female was admitted with a slowly growing nodular lesion at the left nasolabial region for three years. (Tural, Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013) Written by Tural Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, this report investigates the case of a slow growing bump on the face of a thirty-four-year-old woman. After undergoing an excisional biopsy, it was revealed that the nodule had developed into neurofibroma. Originally the patient had undergone excision however she sustained recurrence in under a year of the surgery. She continued to undergo excision and this led to the diagnosis of malignant chondroid syringoma. To remove the tumour, the patient first had a pathological and histopathological examination to examine the metastisation and growth pattern. According to Tural Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, ‚Äúthe tumour had an expansive growing pattern and a few pleomorphic, atypical cells, and a rare mitotic activity.‚Äù(Tural Sel√ßukbiricik, G√ºnver, Karƒ±≈ümaz, and Serdengecti, 2013) They also completed thoracic, abdominal, and cranial CT scans to determine the state of metastasis. The patient has a routine check-up of every three months to ensure no recurrence occurs and so far, has not had any relapse for two years following her procedure. = Malignant chondroid syringoma of the scalp = This 2013 case report by Malik, Saxena, and Kamath investigates the ‚Äúlarge, fungating, and ulcerated growth‚Äù(Malik, Saxena, and Kamath, 2013) on the scalp of a sixty-one-year-old woman. The tumour was painless and developed gradually over nine months. An initial diagnosis determined the growth to be a squamous cell malignancy of the scalp. The patient was suggested to have a CECT scan of their head. The scan revealed dural invasion and a surgical excision with primary closure was performed. The histopathology findings revealed: > ‚Äúsmall groups as well as scattered pleomorphic epithelial cells having > hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm with one to two mitotic figures > of high power field, surrounded by abundant basophilic chondromyxoid stroma, > diagnostic of malignant CS.‚Äù The woman died two days after her operation after yielding a ‚Äúhigh-grade fever and altered sensorium.‚Äù(Malik, Saxena, and Kamath, 2013) = Multifocal and recurrent malignant chondroid syringoma = This report follows the development of MCS on a sixty-four-year-old male patient. The masses were described as skin lesions that had developed in a nodular fashion on the patient's right arm. To remove the growths, the patient underwent may surgical procedures where the nodules were effectively excised. The growth was described as a: > ‚Äúten centimetre, firm, lobulated mass with skin ulceration and muscle > involvement was removed. Microscopic examination revealed infiltrating nests > of medium to large epithelial cells embedded in a chondromyxoid matrix with > few scattered plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells. There was brisk mitosis as > well as large areas of tumour necrosis. All auxiliary lymph nodes were > negative for tumour.‚Äù (Garcia, Atun, and Fernando, 2016) From this information, Garcia, Atun, and Fernando diagnosed the patient with malignant chondroid syringoma. After the surgery, the patient developed further growths on the scalp, face, body, upper right arm, and right foot. He was recommended chemotherapy however died before treatment began. = Lymph node metastasis after excision = This journal, written by Watarai, Amoh, Aki, Takasu, and Katsuoka discusses a case of malignant chondroid syringoma on a forty-six-year-old man and the state his diagnosis 12 years after excision. Originally in 1996, the man observed an ‚Äúasymptomatic, enlarging nodule‚Äù (Watarai, Amoh, Aki, Takasu, and Katsuoka, 2011) on the sole of his right foot and proceeded to undergo an initial biopsy where he was not diagnosed. Physically, the nodule was ‚Äúsolitary, dome-shaped, skin coloured, and firm,‚Äù (Watarai, Amoh, Aki, Takasu, and Katsuoka, 2011) and was 30 mm x 30 mm. The tumour underwent excision utilising a three-millimetre margin. The nodule was then replaced with grafting of the transplanted skin. The findings were as follows. > ‚ÄúThe surgical specimen showed a lobular proliferation of tumour cells with > glandular differentiation associated with a few mitotic cells, embedded in a > mucinous stroma. Immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of tumour > cells were positive for PAS diastase, toluidine blue, cytokeratins (CAM5.2, > CK7), S-100 protein and GCDFP-15.‚Äù Although some abnormal tumours cells were present, the recorded findings the man was diagnosed with chondroid syringoma. An ultrasound and radiography were performed and revealed no indication of metastasis. However, in 2008, the man observed inflammation in his right groin area. Another ultrasound revealed a new mass also measuring 30 mm x 30mm, which was then excised. Examination of this new tumour revealed more abnormal tumour cells compared to the first nodule of the sole of the foot. The original diagnosis was thus re-examined to be consisting of malignant chondroid syringoma cells. The patient was then treated with radiation. After eighteen months he presented no evidence of recurrence or further distant metastasis.  History  Hirsch and Helwig gave malignant chondroid syringoma its name in 1961 in ‚ÄòChondroid Syringoma: Mixed Tumour of Skin, Salivary Gland Type.‚Äô \\"Atypical mixed tumours of the skin,\\"(Hirsch and Helwig, 1961) their term for tumours characterised by \\"histological stigma of malignancy, local invasion, and satellite tumour nodules without proven metastases\\" is employed even now. As of 2011, only 43 cases have been reported. Terminology Malignant mixed tumours also go by other names including: \\"malignant mixed tumour of skin, cutaneous malignant mixed tumour, metastasising chondroid syringoma, and aggressive chondroid syringoma.\\" (Ka, Gnangnon, and Diouf, 2016)  See also  * List of cutaneous conditions * Neoplasm  References  Category:Epidermal nevi, neoplasms, and cysts ","title":"Malignant chondroid syringoma"},{"id":"23150215","text":"Esad Komiƒá (born 29 February 1944) is a former Yugoslav professional footballer.

Fife was also a hyperbaric medicine specialist who was known for his pioneering research on pressurized environments ranging from high altitude to underwater habitats. Fife was a Professor Emeritus at Texas A&M; University. Education Fife began his training in anatomy from the University of Washington in 1935 and had started his first year of medical school when World War II began. Fife earned a bachelor of science in biology from the University of Oregon in 1956. He later completed a Ph.D. in physiology at Ohio State University in 1962. Fife was a Certified Hyperbaric Technologist (CHT) through the National Board of Diving and Hyperbaric Medical Technology. Military career Fife left medical school and was commissioned Second Lieutenant in U.S. Army in June 1939. Fife then reported to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington for training in Aug 1940. After receiving his basic infantry training, he reported to the 60th Infantry at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where he served as an Assistant Operations Officer in September 1940. Fife volunteered for the 18th class of Parachute Jump School in Fort Benning, Georgia in April 1942. Following his training in May 1942, he joined the newly formed 503rd parachute infantry battalion as Company Commander. As Company Commanding Officer of the 503rd parachute infantry regiment in Sept 1943, Fife led his company in a jump in the Markham Valley, New Guinea. This was the first successful airborne combat jump in the Pacific Theater of Operations. His first combat jump was planned with the ground elevation 500 feet lower than it actually was and Fife found himself in a coconut tree. Fife had completed 35 training and combat jumps by the time WWII ended. Fife reported to the U.S. Army FE Headquarters Office of Intelligence in January 1944 then to the 68th Airborne Air Control Squadrons (AACS) combat operations in SW Pacific in September. He then went on to the 141st AACS special ops in New Guinea & P.I. in January 1945. Fife reported to the AACS Headquarters Office of Intelligence in Washington, DC in August 1945. Hoping for a chance to ride in the planes more often, Fife transferred to the Air Force in November 1947 where he was immediately sent to the Defense Language Institute to learn Russian. He became the first Russian linguist of the USAF Security Service (USAFSS) command. Fife was among the first inductees to the Defense Language Institute Hall of Fame. Fife was sent to 1st Radio Squadron Mobile, Johnson Air Base, Japan during the Allied Occupation where he earned the unofficial title, \\"Father of USAFSS Command in the Far East\\". Part of his duties included intelligence briefings for General Douglas MacArthur. Russian forces were beginning to build up and the Far East Air Force needs were changing, Fife proposed airborne Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection. In 1950, Fife planned and flew the first USAF Security Service reconnaissance missions from Kadena Air Base over the Sea of Japan with a wire recorder and jury- rigged receiver on an RB-29 air plane. As a result of these missions proved the feasibility for USAFSS airborne COMINT collection and Fife is considered the \\"Father of Airborne Intercept\\". He also managed to earn a first degree black belt. In 2006, Fife was inducted into the Air Intelligence Agency Hall of Honor. Fife was then sent to North Korea where he served as USAFSS 1st RSM's liaison officer to Fifth Air Force Headquarters located in Kim Il-sung's palace and stayed until the then Capt. Fife, ordered the evacuation of USAFSS COMINT personnel as Chinese entered the Korean War. Fife's position was the beginning of the future USAFSS Special Security Office program. In 1951, Fife set up USAFSS linguist team operations in Pyeongtaek with the 606th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. Fife had a great respect for the Korean operators he worked with noting they were \\"the best I have ever seen\\". In 1951, Fife returned to Japan until transfer to Moscow shortly after Stalin died. Lieutenant Colonel Fife, with his wife Ann, served as Assistant Air Attach√© at the U.S. Embassy with military intelligence as a Russian expert. Following his time in Moscow, he spent time at The Pentagon as the Intelligence Briefing Officer for General Twining and General LeMay. Colonel Fife translated for President Dwight D. Eisenhower a radio transmission from a Soviet fighter pilot intercepted after shooting down a USAF C-130 ACRP (60528) over Armenia in September 1958. In 1962, after obtaining his Ph.D., he served as Assistant Chief of the Aerospace Medical Research Division at Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas where he performed research essential to the space race. His work was in cardiovascular responses and measurement tools critical for tests of g-force and near-vacuum survival. The Air Force did not have a training program in hyperbaric medicine so Fife was trained by the Navy. His first test dive was performed with Micky Goodwin and Robert Workman. Col. Fife retired from the Air Force in 1967. Academic career Dr. Fife joined the Texas A&M; University Department of Biology faculty in 1967. In his time there he served as the Chairman of the Biology Department, Dean of Research and Vice President for Academic Affairs as well as chairman for numerous academic committees. Dr. Fife was instrumental in the founding of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences. He retired from Texas A&M; in 1997. Contributions to hyperbaric medicine Inside Hydrolab Fife was a pioneer in undersea medicine and served as director of the Texas A&M; University Hyperbaric laboratory. Fife was active with the HydroLab saturation diving research program funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Fife was an aquanaut having spent 28 days in saturation in the habitat performing physiology experiments. The first uses of hydrox, a gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is used as a breathing gas in very deep diving are usually attributed to six ocean dive trials by the Swedish engineer, Arne Zetterstr√∂m in 1945. Fife later showed that hydrox would allow divers to descend and work at great depths. Fife also developed the first decompression tables for the use of the mixture. The French engineering company COMEX (Compagnie maritime d'expertises) later applied Fife's work in developing their HYDRA dive series. Much of his other diving medical research was focused on women in diving and spinal cord decompression sickness. Fife's interest in clinical hyperbaric medicine lead to several research projects to look for new indications for the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It has been estimated that about half of the 2,000 patient treatments done by his lab were for research. These projects included the treatment of: * squamous cell carcinoma in mice with hydrox; * migraine headache; * Post-polio syndrome; * Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; * radionecrosis; * brown recluse spider bites; * non-union fractures; * closed head injury; * Chronic Lyme disease. HyperTrak clinical documentation software, marketed by Intellicure, Inc., was started at Texas A&M; University with Dr. Fife and David Walker in 1996. Professional societies Fife was a member of the Aerospace Medical Association, the American Physiological Society, Sigma Xi and the American Academy of Underwater Sciences. He served on the Executive Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. Awards Texas A&M; University presented Fife with the University Outstanding Award for Teaching in 1975. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society conveyed their Paul Bert Award for Distinguished Research to Fife in 1983 and their Oceaneering Award for Research in 1994. On his 78th birthday in 1995, Fife and a team from Diving Diseases Research Centre received \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Prize of the British Sub-Aqua Club\\" which was presented by H.R.H. Prince Philip for their work on \\"Men and Women in Diving\\".

The operation in Iran was to be led by SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Otto Skorzeny of the Waffen SS. A group of agents from the Soviet Union, led by Soviet spy Gevork Vartanian, uncovered the plot before its inception and the mission was never launched. The assassination plan and its disruption has been popularized by the Russian media with appearances in films and novels. Planning According to Soviet sources, German military intelligence discovered, after breaking a U.S. Navy code, that a major conference would be held at Tehran in mid-October 1943. Based on this information, Adolf Hitler approved a scheme to kill all three Allied leaders. Operational control was passed to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, chief of the Reich Security Main Office, who chose Skorzeny to head the mission. The German agent Elyesa Bazna (codenamed \\"Cicero\\"), in Ankara, Turkey, was also brought into the operation. Counter-intelligence The NKVD alleged that, despite German secrecy, it quickly uncovered the plot following a tip-off from Soviet agent Nikolai Kuznetsov, who was posing as Paul Siebert, an Oberleutnant in the Wehrmacht from Nazi-occupied Ukraine. He got the information from an SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer named von Ortel, who was known to become \\"talkative\\" when drinking. However, other sources state that Hans Ulrich von Ortel never existed, and was a fictional person set up by Russians. The Soviets got more information from 19-year-old Soviet spy Gevork Vartanian, whose team of seven intelligence officers in 1940‚Äì41 had identified more than 400 Nazi agents, all of whom had been arrested by Soviet troops. In 1943, in their efforts to foil the assassination plot devised by the Nazis, Vartanian‚Äôs group located an advance party of six German radio operators who had dropped by parachute near Qum, from Tehran. The Soviet agents tailed the German spies to the Iranian capital, where an existing Abwehr network set them up in a villa. From this location, the German observers radioed intelligence reports back to Berlin. However, unknown to them, all their transmissions were being intercepted, recorded, and decoded by NKVD operatives. The decrypts revealed that a second group of operatives, led by Skorzeny, would be dropped into Iran for the actual assassination attempt in mid-October. The NKVD claimed that this supported existing intelligence about the involvement of the SS commander because Vartanian's group had already tailed Skorzeny during his own reconnaissance mission to Tehran. Vartanian later told the following details, > We followed them to Tehran, where the Nazi field station had readied a villa > for their stay. They were travelling by camel, and were loaded with weapons. > While we were watching the group, we established that they had contacted > Berlin by radio, and recorded their communication...When we decrypted these > radio messages, we learnt that the Germans were preparing to land a second > group of subversives for a terrorist act‚Äîthe assassination or abduction of > the 'Big Three‚Äô. The second group was supposed to be led by Skorzeny > himself. All the members of the first group were arrested and forced to contact their handlers under Soviet supervision. The operation got off track and the main group led by Skorzeny never went to Tehran. Thus the success of Vartanian's group in locating the Nazi advance party prevented the Nazi attempt to assassinate the \\"Big Three\\".RIA Novosti ‚Äì Opinion & analysis ‚Äì Tehran-43: Wrecking the plan to kill Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill Cancellation According to the NKVD, with October approaching the mission was aborted; Berlin is said to have received a secret code from Tehran indicating that its agents had discovered they were under surveillance. In 1984, Vartanian was recognised for his role in uncovering Operation Long Jump. He was awarded the Gold Star medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union for his service in World War II and the Cold War. In 2007 he met with Winston Churchill's granddaughter and was congratulated for his great service to the Allies. In 2003, relying on declassified documents, Yuri Lvovich Kuznets published a book called Tehran-43 or Operation Long Jump, which detailed Vartanian‚Äôs role at the Tehran Conference. A Soviet film, Tegeran-43, which featured Alain Delon, was released in 1981. Western skepticism When Stalin informed Churchill and Roosevelt about the plan, some members within the American and British delegations doubted the existence of a plot because all evidence of its existence was provided by Soviet intelligence. In Britain, the Joint Intelligence Committee of the War Cabinet, considering the matter afterwards in London, concluded that the so-called Nazi plot against the Big Three was \\"complete baloney\\". There have been debates about the veracity of the story. Skeptics brought up a number of arguments in that regard. Firstly, the German espionage network in Iran had been destroyed in mid-1943, well before Tehran was chosen as a meeting place. Secondly, more than 3,000 NKVD security troops guarded the city for the duration of the conference without incident. Thirdly, both Roosevelt and Churchill travelled on foot or open jeep throughout their four-day stay in Tehran. Otto Skorzeny denied the story after the war. In his memoirs, he recalled a meeting with Hitler and SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg, from the foreign intelligence branch of the Sicherheitsdienst, when they did discuss the feasibility of assassinating Churchill. However, Skorzeny said he told the Fuhrer the idea was unworkable and that Hitler agreed with his assessment. Skorzeny wrote, \\"Long Jump has really only existed in the imagination of a bunch of less than truth-loving hacks [...]\\". He also castigated Soviet sources for continually referring to Sturmbannf√ºhrer Paul von Oertel, who Skorzeny said never existed. Historiography In Russia, the story remains a subject of great interest.

It documented Long Jump and was to be presented by Churchill's granddaughter Celia Sandys. In his memoirs, Pavel Sudoplatov brought up the details of how Kuznetsov recruited German officer Oster. According to Sudoplatov, the training of German saboteurs was taking place in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, where the group led by the intelligence officer Kuznetsov, who was disguised as a Wehrmacht lieutenant, was working. Oster, who owed Kunetsov some money, offered to pay back the debt with Persian carpets after his trip to Tehran, which suggested that the plot about the assassination attempt during the Tehran conference was quite feasible.Pavel Sudoplatov. Special Operations: Lubyanka and Kremlin 1930‚Äì1950 // –û–õ–ú–ê-press, 2003. p. 205 French journalist Laslo Havas wrote a book about Operation Long jump after the war and confirmed that Soviet intelligence had disrupted the German plot. Professor Miron Rezun, a political scientist from the University of New Brunswick, states that Operation Long Jump was not the work of a Soviet disinformation campaign because German commandos had carried out other daring raids. He notes that Roosevelt recorded that he was personally informed of the plot by Stalin himself. The diary of Alexander Cadogan, a British diplomat, also mentions that he received information from the Russians about a plan to murder the Big Three. Rezun says some researchers and journalists in Germany deny the existence of the planned operation and accuse Laslo Havas of believing Soviet disinformation. For example, Heinz H√∂hne, a famous historian and specialist on the history of the Third Reich (as well as writing a complete biography of Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the Abwehr), wrote in an article in Der Spiegel that no such German plot ever existed, but Rezun notes that H√∂hne omits from the article the fact that Canaris had visited Tehran on the eve of the German attack on the Soviet Union.Miron Rezun.

He stated that following the arrest in August 1943 of Franz Meyer, a German resident in Iran, only remnants of a German spy network remained. Between 22 and 27 November, six groups of parachutists under the command of a Rudolf von Holten-Pflug were dropped near Qom and another eight groups, 60 people in all, under the command of a Vladimir Shkvarev, were dropped near Kazvin. The NKVD quickly arrested the teams led by Shkvarev. Further units were led by SD agents Lothar Schollhorn and Winifred Oberg, but they did not suspect the Soviets knew about them because of Meyer. Stalin offered to let Roosevelt and Churchill stay in the Soviet embassy during the conference. However, Roosevelt insisted on staying at the US embassy on the other side of the city, but the planned ambush of the Big Three was disrupted because the British arrested Holten- Pflug and his group on the night of 31 November. On 2 December, six more German agents, who had been betrayed by double agent Ernst Merser, were arrested. In his detailed monograph Espionage and Counterintelligence in Occupied Persia (Iran), Anglo-Canadian intelligence historian Adrian O'Sullivan has thoroughly reviewed the primary sources and secondary literature on Operation Long Jump and has placed the alleged plot squarely in the context of Allied security operations around the time of the Tehran Conference. O'Sullivan claims to have debunked the perpetuation of the myth in recent years by the KGB and the Putin-era intelligence services. The novel Stormtroop Edelweiss - Valley of the Assassins, by Charles Whiting (writing as Leo Kessler), presents a heavily fictionalized version of Operation Long Jump, substituting a unit of elite German mountain troops for Skorzeny and his party.

It was directed by Arnold Laven and starred Paul Newman, Wendell Corey, Lee Marvin and Walter Pidgeon. After two years in a North Korean prison camp, an American officer returns home, only to be charged with collaboration by his own side. He is forced to defend his actions in court. Plot Having survived two years in a Korean prisoner- of-war camp, Captain Edward W. Hall, Jr. (Paul Newman), returns home to a US Army post in San Francisco. His father (Walter Pidgeon), a retired colonel, is glad to have his son back despite grieving over the death of his other son, Pete. Pete's widow, Aggie Hall (Anne Francis), confides to her friend Caroline (Cloris Leachman) it is difficult to be around her brother-in-law without painful reminders of her lost husband. A welcome-home party is held for Capt. Hall, surprising Colonel Dudley Smith (Fay Roope), a friend of Ed, Sr. He finds out that Capt. Hall's father is unaware that his son is about to be tried in a court-martial for collaboration with the enemy. Hall's father asks his son if the charges are true, and receives a stark, simple, reply: \\"yes\\". Ed Sr. cruelly challenges his son: \\"Why didn't you just die?\\" Major Sam Moulton (Wendell Corey) prosecutes the case. He calls eyewitnesses who testify that at the POW camp in the winter of 1951, Hall made speeches and signed documents on the enemy's behalf. A fellow prisoner and much-decorated officer, Capt. John Miller (Lee Marvin), reveals scars received while under interrogation, but claims he never conceded to his captors anything but his name, rank and serial number. In unguarded comments on the stand Miller calls Hall a coward. Capt. Hall has his sister-in-law's support, but his father initially refuses even to attend the trial. Hall is disconsolate and wishes to plead guilty. But his lawyer, Lt. Col. Frank Wasnick (Edmond O'Brien), persuades him to take the witness stand and explain his actions. In stark detail, Capt. Hall discloses the torture he underwent. This includes how he was ordered to bury other soldiers, dead or alive; how he carried a wounded man for four days so he wouldn't collapse and be placed in a grave; solitary confinement for months at a time, denied light and company and forced to live in his own excrement. Facing repeated demands to read propaganda statements, Hall relented but wrote one himself, using language that attempted to mock the enemy's purpose. Hall experienced a breaking point when the enemy delivered a letter from his father, revealing his brother Pete's death. Hall's father, who finally attends the trial, is devastated by his son's testimony about his breaking point. He forgives his son, but the official judgment is less kind. Hall is found guilty of treason and the film closes with Hall's contrition on the witness stand. Cast * Paul Newman as Capt. Edward W. Hall Jr. * Wendell Corey as Maj.

Atlanta‚Äôs public safety improvement between 2001 and 2009 occurred at more than twice the rate of the rest of the country. After ranking in the top five highest violent crime cities for most of the previous three decades, in 2009 Atlanta ranked 31st, and in 2015, 24/7 Wall Street ranked it 19th.The Most Dangerous Cities in America, page 3, 24/7 Wall Street, September 27, 2016. Retrieved February 18, 2017. While various news sources report rankings by crime rate, FBI strongly cautions against this, because this is a misuse of bare statistics, since it ignores various important factors, such as population density, degree of urbanization, composition of population, economic conditions, etc. History An Atlanta police car During the 1970s, like with many large cities within the United States, Atlanta's population began to decline. By 1990, the population was 394,017, down almost 20% from its population in 1970, which was 496,973. In addition, the city center and surrounding areas began to go through an urban decay, and crime spiked significantly throughout the 1980s. Along with many other major cities in the United States, Atlanta was hard hit by the crack epidemic of most of the 1980s to early 1990s. In 1994, Atlanta was ranked the most dangerous city in the country by the Morgan Quitno Press.The First Safest/Most Dangerous City Listing. Morgan Quitno Press. Lawrence, Kansas, United States. 1994. In 1997, drug-related crime in metro Atlanta increased slightly, in part due to Atlanta becoming an important distribution center for cocaine, and other related drugs imported from Mexico. These increases were mostly seen in Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb, and Clayton counties. Many law enforcement agencies in the area have joined forces together with the Atlanta Police Department in an effort to decrease the overall crime in metro Atlanta. In addition, due to large amounts of revitalization projects in the city core, crime continued to fall, even amidst the hard economic times of the late-2000s/early 2010s. Policing The city is served by the Atlanta Police Department. In 2013, the APD had 2,000 officers,Becca J. G. Godwin, 51 Atlanta homicides from 2016 remain unsolved. These are the victims, Atlanta Journal Constitution (February 15, 2017).Jonathan Shapiro, 2,000 Atlanta Police Officers, But Gripes Remain Over Pay, WABE (October 25, 2013).Katie Leslie, APD reaches a once-elusive goal of 2,000 officers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (October 25, 2013). but the number of officers has decreased since that time. Mayor Kasim Reed has identified an increase in the number of officers to 2,000 as a goal for the city. Although city data shows that APD attrition rates have improved from the 2000s to 2013, morale issues within the police department has persisted due to officer dissatisfaction with salaries. About 45 percent of officers hired between 2005 and 2013 left the force by 2017.Christian Boone, Murders in Atlanta are way up, but overall crime is way down, Atlanta Journal- Constitution (January 31, 2017). Atlanta is divided into six police patrol zones. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), which operates rail, bus, and parking lots in the city and surrounding area, has its own police force. Overall crime rates in are about 30 per every 100,000 system daily riders, which is identical to the crime figure for the Washington, D.C. area's WMATA, higher than crime figure for the Boston area's MBTA, and lower than the crime figure for the San Francisco area's BART. Homicides within the MARTA system have varied. In the fiscal year ending in 2017, for example, there were four homicides investigated by MARTA police, but there were no homicides in the MARTA system in any of the previous last four fiscal years.Joshua Sharpe, After recent killings, how safe is MARTA?, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (February 16, 2017). Total crimes in the MARTA system have declined from fiscal year 2013. Crime rates and trends From 2009 to 2016, overall crime in Atlanta declined 27 percent, \\"with sharp declines in burglaries (9,102 in 2009 to 4,377 in 2016), robberies (2,622 to 1,914) and aggravated assaults (2,602 to 2,179).\\" =Homicide= Consistent with national trends, the murder rate in Atlanta peaked in 1990 and has declined since.Bryan Cronan, The Homicide Report, Atlanta Magazine (May 15, 2014). From 2000 to 2010, murders in the city declined by nearly 50 percent. The years 2009 and 2012 had the lowest numbers of homicides in Atlanta than any year dating back to 1963,Marcus K. Garner, Atlanta homicides 2nd lowest in 50 years, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (January 10, 2013). but there has been an increase in murders in the city beginning in 2013. The number of murders in Atlanta was 80 in 2009, 92 in 2010, 88 in 2011, 85 in 2012, 82 in 2013, 93 in 2014, 95 in 2015, and 111 in 2016. A significant number of murders have remained unsolved; as of February 2017, 51 of the 111 homicides from 2016 remain unsolved. An analysis of FBI Uniform Crime Report data for 2015, conducted by the economic analysis website 24/7 Wall Street, showed a murder rate in Atlanta of about 20.2 per 100,000 people, making it the 18th highest murder rate among U.S. cities.Fiza Pirani, Atlanta named one of America's top 'murder capitals', Atlanta Journal-Constitution (November 2, 2016). A October 2016 FiveThirtyEight analysis of preliminary 2016 data, taken from official police information and local reports, found that among U.S. cities with populations of over a quarter-million people, Atlanta had the tenth-highest murder rate, at 23.9 per 100,000 residents.Jeff Asher, A Handful Of Cities Are Driving 2016's Rise In Murders, FiveThirtyEight (October 6, 2016). Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said that 17% of 2014 homicides in the county were gang-related.Christian Boone, Violent crime fueled by gangs on the rise in Atlanta, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (July 1, 2015). In Atlanta, guns were involved in 82% of homicide cases. In July 2016, in an attempt to combat an increase in homicide, the city began Operation Whiplash, with additional police officers and other resources assigned to 33 \\"challenging and crime- ridden\\" neighborhoods in the city.As murder rate rises, Atlanta aims to get guns off streets, Associated Press (July 5, 2016). Gang crime Street gangs of various levels of sophistication have had a presence in the city since the late 1970s. In 2015, Atlanta police were tracking about 192 gangs, more than double the number identified six years earlier. The supervisor of the FBI's Atlanta Safe Streets Gang Task ForceCrime in Atlanta: Fighting back: What gangs can offer young Asian-Americans, The Economist (July 11, 2016). said in 2016 that more than half of violent crime in the city involved gang members.Mark Winne, Metro Atlanta's gang problem larger than ever before, WSB- TV (November 14, 2016). In addition to violent crime, drug dealing, and carjacking, some Atlanta gangs commit identity theft and credit card fraud. Human trafficking Atlanta is now a major transportation hub when it comes to trafficking young girls from Mexico and is one of the fourteen U.S. cities with the highest levels of sex trafficking of children. In the year of 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta. This number derives from the study \\"Estimating the Size and Structure of the Underground Commercial Sex Economy in Eight Major US Cities\\" by the Urban Institute, with 18 interviews conducted in Atlanta, and includes \\"prostitutes, massage parlors, and brothels\\" including both \\"pimp controlled\\" and \\"non-pimp controlled\\". In the study, human trafficking is defined in the section \\"Background on the Prevalence of Human Trafficking in the United States\\" as \\"any sex act in exchange for which anything of value is given to or received by any person (e.g., prostitution).\\" . Since Atlanta has ‚Äúthe same ready access to commercial air and ground routes that draws businesses and travelers to Atlanta also entices criminals engaged in human trafficking‚Äù.

Axel Theimer (; born March 10, 1946) is a conductor, composer, singer, author and professor at the College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University (CSB/SJU) in Minnesota. He conducts the professional a cappella choir Kantorei (Minneapolis/Saint Paul), the National Catholic Youth Choir and the Amadeus Chamber Symphony, and as of 2020 is in his 52nd year as a music faculty member at CSB/SJU, where he conducts CSB/SJU Chamber Choir and the SJU Men's Chorus. He is on the faculty and is executive director of the VoiceCare Network. He is an acknowledged expert on healthy vocal production for solo and choral singing, and the effect of conducting gesture on vocalists and instrumentalists. His choirs are known and praised for their particularly warm, natural, expressive and efficient sound.  Biography  = Early life = Theimer was born in 1946 in the village of Sankt Johann in Tirol in the State of Tyrol, Austria. His parents managed a retreat camp in the Austrian Alps for children from the nearby city of Innsbruck. In the farm-like setting, Theimer's earliest exposure to music included singing folksongs around the campfire, while hiking, and at evening gatherings. Theimer began taking piano lessons at age four in the village of St. Johann, about an hour's walk down the mountainside every other week. = Education = Theimer was accepted into the training choir of the Vienna Boys‚Äô Choir at age seven and joined one of the touring choirs at age nine. He was a member of the choir until age 14. During those years he toured Europe, South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique and, twice (1958 and 1960) the United States. The tour in 1958 included a concert at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. After completing his time with the boys‚Äô choir, he finished his high school education (Realgymnasium) with the matura while also continuing his piano studies and singing with several choral groups in Vienna, including the Jeunesse Musicale and the Zusatzchor at the Vienna State Opera. After high school he was a student at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna until he moved to the United States to begin his tenure on the music faculty at CSB/SJU. Theimer holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Saint John's University (1971). He received a Master of Fine Arts in choral conducting (1974) and Doctor of Musical Arts in vocal performance (1984) from the University of Minnesota, where he was a student of Tom Lancaster and Roy Schuessler.  Career  = Conducting = While living in Vienna, Theimer conducted the Chorus Viennensis, the adult performing partner ensemble to the Vienna Boys‚Äô Choir, for two years. In 1969, SJU Men's Chorus director Gerhardt Track recommended Theimer to succeed him as the choral director at Saint John's University. Theimer arrived in Minnesota that summer. Theimer has conducted the SJU Men's Chorus since joining the faculty at Saint John's University in 1969. In the same year, he also organized the first mixed choir for students of the College of Saint Benedict (a college for women) and Saint John's University (a college for men), which evolved into the CSB/SJU Chamber Choir, now one of the major touring ensembles of the combined CSB/SJU music department. In 1984 Theimer founded the Amadeus Chamber Symphony, a community chamber orchestra for central Minnesota musicians and audiences. The orchestra plays a full concert season each year and participates in annual Christmas at Saint John‚Äôs and other concerts involving CSB/SJU choral ensembles. The orchestra also hosts several community and youth partnership concerts each season. Since 1988, Theimer has conducted Kantorei , a professional choir specializing in 19th- and 20th-century a cappella music from central Europe. The choir is known throughout the Midwest for its distinctively effortless sound, warm blend and expressive interpretation. It has been praised for reflecting the emotional content of both text and music. Kantorei presents concerts at churches in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area and collaborates with schools as a part of its ‚ÄúSinging for a Lifetime‚Äù educational outreach program. Kantorei has been featured on Classical Minnesota Public Radio (KSJN), A Prairie Home Companion, and Twin Cities Public Television, and has produced five CD recordings. While its main repertoire is a cappella choral music, Kantorei has collaborated with the Minnesota Orchestra, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Minnesota Sinfonia and Minnesota Chorale during its 22 seasons. Kantorei is not affiliated with the choir of the same name based in Denver, Colorado, or the boys‚Äô choir of the same name based in Rockford, Illinois. Since 2000, Theimer has been music director of the National Catholic Youth Choir, a choir for Roman Catholic high school students from across the United States that meets each summer at Saint John's University. Theimer has conducted all-state choirs, choral festivals, and honor choirs throughout the United States, Canada and Asia, and has presented master classes, workshops and seminars for state, regional and national music conventions and conferences, including ACDA, MENC, VCDA (Virginia Choral Directors Association) Senior Honors Choir Director MMEA, OKMEA, and NPM. His annual Impact Course offered by the VoiceCare Network has attracted choir directors, classroom teachers, singers and others interested in the human voice and human compatible learning/teaching, from around the world. = Solo and recital career = Theimer is an active solo performer and recitalist. He regularly sings with Pastiche, an ensemble of the music faculty at CSB/SJU. His solo recitals, while focusing frequently on the art song repertoire by Beethoven, Brahms, Frederick Loewe, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss and Hugo Wolf, also include major literature by Samuel Barber, Gabriel Faur√©, Gerald Finzi, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, Francis Poulenc, Peter Warlock and others. With guitarist O. Nicholas Raths, he has produced two solo recordings of Austrian folksongs. Theimer also frequently appears as a baritone soloist with choirs and orchestras for oratorio performances, including everything from J.S. Bach‚Äôs St. John‚Äôs Passion to the CSB/SJU and St. Cloud State University music departments‚Äô 2008 presentation of Stephen Paulus‚Äôs Holocaust memorial oratorio To Be Certain of the Dawn. = Teaching = At CSB/SJU, Theimer teaches applied voice, vocal pedagogy, choral conducting and other related courses. = Writings = Theimer is co-author of several chapters in Bodymind and Voice: Foundations of Voice Education, co-edited by Dr. Leon Thurman and Dr. Graham Welch. The book is used as vocal pedagogy text in universities in the United States, Canada, Australia and Great Britain. He is currently executive director of the VoiceCare Network, a professional association offering seminars and training to music educators, choral conductors, voice teachers and singers. = Awards = In November 2001 Theimer was named Choir Director of the Year by Minnesota American Choral Directors Association (ACDA- MN). He received the Alumni Achievement Award from Saint John's University in 1997 and, in 2004, was inducted to the Minnesota Music Educators Association (MMEA) Hall of Fame. In 2011, Theimer received the ACDA-MN F. Melius Christiansen Lifetime Achievement Award.

It debuted in London in May 1945. Variety called it \\"good theatre\\".Review of 1945 London play at Variety It ran for over two years. The London production only cost $12,000 and made a sizeable profit for its investors. The play was produced on Broadway with Boris Karloff in 1949 but only ran seven performances. BBC TV Version The play was adapted for BBC TV in 1946. Production Film rights were bought by British Lion in May 1945. It would be one of the first three movies made by Alex Korda under his new deal with British Lion, the others being A Man about the House and Nightbeat. Oscar Homolka was imported from the US to star. George King was to make A Lady was to Die but delayed that to make this movie. Filming started at 6 August 1946. It was shot at Isleworth Studios. The film's sets were designed by the art director Bernard Robinson. It was the film debut of Diana Dors. According to Filmink, \\"The part was an ideal way to start out ‚Äì the girlfriend of a slimy blackmailer ‚Äì and Diana had ‚Äúit‚Äù from the start: looks, warmth, appeal, if a little too young (then) for the nightclub milieu that her character lived in; even watching the movie today, she ‚Äúpops‚Äù off the screen, a complete natural. \\" Muriel Pavlov and Derek Farr, who played lovers in the movie, were married shortly after filming. Critical reception Variety said \\"Absence of Oscar Homolka from screen for consider-able period makes marquee value problematical. Picture will have to rely mainly on word-of-mouth and a 15-minute cut would speed up story and help considerably. Film gathers pace and is truly cinematic in the second half, but the first part is deadly slow and too explanatory without explaining much.

The island was formed during the region's last ice age, 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Over 400 species of flora currently inhabit the island, including many rare varieties in Oakland County. Native Americans previously inhabited Apple Island, until ceding the island to the United States in the Treaty of Detroit. Currently, the West Bloomfield School District uses the island as an educational nature center. Apple Island, Orchard Lake, Michigan Topography Apple Island is a island, spanning three-eighths of a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width.Apple Island, the Marjorie Ward Strong Woodland Sanctuary. West Bloomfield School District, circa 1972, page 3. The island's highest point is in elevation, approximately above the normal elevation of Orchard Lake.Apple Island, the Marjorie Ward Strong Woodland Sanctuary. West Bloomfield School District, circa 1972, page 5. The island's formation traces back to the recession of the region's last ice age glacier 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Apple Island Sanctuary contains examples of every type of ecological system identified within the southeastern Michigan region. Over 400 species of flora live upon the island, including many rare varieties in Oakland County. Archaeology In the 1930s an Apple Island resident discovered a French-made spun pewter bowl while plowing his cornfield. The bowl was filled with wampum, and was constructed in the late 18th century or early 19th century. The bowl was probably a gift from the French to the Native Americans. The Cranbrook Collection currently houses the artifact. Several one-meter-square test pits dug on the west side of the island in 1997 yielded pottery and stone tools. No evidence however exists that pottery production ever occurred on the island, nor is there a local source of flint or other stone suitable for the manufacturing of tools. Accordingly, these items were most likely brought to the island. These artifacts signal the influence of early Europeans on the area's native population. Many of these silver trade items were recovered during archaeological excavations on the island in June 2000. A third dig conducted in August 2008 concluded that, \\"[i]t is currently impossible to determine how often or for how long the site was occupied by American Indians or exactly when this may have occurred. It is most likely that the site area was one of the many local archaeological sites various American Indian groups used casually and ephemerally during the 15th or 16th or even the early 17th century and then occupied again, possibly by very different peoples, some time around the last half of the 18th or the early 19th century. But it is also possible that 200K52/476 is one of those extremely rare sites occupied between 1625 AD and 1725 AD when both aboriginal stone-working and ceramic manufacturing technologies and European trade co-existed. Only carefully planned and executed archaeological excavation and professional analyses documenting undisturbed deposits can determine the facts regarding the potential importance of this site on Apple Island.\\"Archaeological Excavations and Testing Site 20OK476 and \\"Pontiac's Mound\\" on Apple Island. David Brose. October 8, 2008, Page 8. Local folklore recounts Ottawa Chief Pontiac's burial on the island.Song of the Heron: Reflections on the History of West Bloomfield. Charles H. Martinez. Orchard Lake, Michigan: Greater West Bloomfield Historical Society Press, 2004, pages 51-53. To test the validity of these accounts, a limited excavation was conducted on a site the islanders referred to as \\"Pontiacs Mound\\" during a 2008 excavation. The results of the test suggested that it \\"appears to be only one of several rather level promontories extending without discernible interruption from the central plateau of the island toward northwestern shore. While additional deep testing may reveal other information, at this time the most appropriate hypothesis is to regard all of these adjacent landforms as non-cultural portions of the higher soils, dissected by centuries [if not millennia] of natural headward erosion and downslope weathering.\\"Archaeological Excavations and Testing Site 20OK476 and \\"Pontiac's Mound\\" on Apple Island. David Brose. October 8, 2008, Page 9. The island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018 for its archaeological significance. Menahsagorning Dr. Samuel M. Leggett‚Äôs epic poem, circulated in 1909, first makes light of the fact that the island was once known as Me-Nah-Sa-Gor-Ning.Me-nah-sa-gor-ning: A Legend of Orchard Lake. Samuel Leggett. n.p., 1909. The poem chronicles an insane Native American maiden‚Äôs devotion to her deceased husband, and her subsequent murder at the hands of her tribe. Leggett claimed that his poem formalized popular lore. According to one writer, a lake in Oakland County was called Menahsagorning, \\"apple place\\" by the Native Americans because of the nearby apple trees and orchards. (Baraga's dictionary defines mishiminatig as ‚Äòapple tree.‚Äô) Early white settlers consequently named the body of water located there \\"Orchard Lake\\", as well as the town established there in 1827. The penultimate syllable of the aboriginal name is probably corrupted, because the \\"r\\" sound is not a part of the Three Fires language.Indian Names in Michigan. Virgil J. Vogel. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1997, page 92. In short, whatever words Native Americans actually used to refer to the island remain a mystery. Samuel W. Durant's 1877 publication, The History of Oakland County Michigan, first mentions that Apple Island and on Orchard Lake's south shore were reservation lands.History of Oakland County, Michigan. Samuel W. Durant, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: L. H. Everts, 1877, page 312. Durant does not indicate his source for this statement, and no independent source verifies this assertion. All subsequent publications have relied on Durant as the authority for this proposition. Native American Settlement Native American discovery of Apple Island may have happened 2,000 years ago.Oral presentation to the Greater West Bloomfield Historical Society. Michael Stafford, Cranbrook Science Institute. May 12, 1999. They may have been drawn to the island because of the security and abundant resources that the land provided. While which Native American tribes inhabited the site prior to white settlement is unknown, each tribe left artifacts as to its way of life; the entire West Bloomfield lakes area has yielded many hammerstones, chert spearheads and bird stones left by Native Americans. The Treaty of Detroit, negotiated on November 17, 1807, surrendered land consisting of approximately the southeast quarter of the lower peninsula of present-day Michigan and a small section of present- day Ohio from the Odawa, Ojibwe, Wyandot, and Potawatomi to the United States government. The eventual settlers to this island remarked that Native Americans frequently visited the island, and referred to the area in their language as ‚Äúapple place.‚Äù When deposed in 1856, Chief Okemos stated, ‚ÄúI was born in Michigan, near Pontiac, on an island in a lake‚Ä¶ I was 30 years old when I left the place I was born.‚ÄùMichigan Pioneer and Historical Society Collection, Vol. XXVI.

Galloway probably never lived on the island, because his name is absent from the 1830 census of the Michigan Territory. One of his sons however eventually settled east of Pontiac.1872 Pontiac Township Plat Map, Sections 10 & 15 Galloway's last will and testament, dated November 19, 1838, states: ‚ÄúI give to my said daughter Julia Ann Galloway all that piece of land, called Apple Island in Orchard Lake. So called, situated in the state of Michigan, and not many miles from Pontiac.‚Äù West Bloomfield records show that ‚Äúnon-resident‚Äù Joseph Allen, Julia Ann Galloway's husband, paid $1.23 in taxes on the island in 1847.Last will and testament of James Galloway of Palmyra, Wayne County, New York, dated November 19, 1838. =William Dow= In 1830, William Dow accompanied by his parents and siblings immigrated to the area from Fife, Scotland. The family settled on on the isthmus between Orchard and Cass lakes, now called Dow Ridge for William Dow, in sections 9 and 10.History of Oakland County, Michigan. Samuel W. Durant, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: L. H. Everts, 1877, page 314. Dow was probably the first white person to live on the island, and the first members of what would later be known as the ‚ÄúScotch settlement.‚Äù On August 19, 1847, William Dow purchased Apple Island from the Allens for $1,050.Warranty Deed, Liber 33, Pages 532 & 533, Register of Deeds Records, Oakland County, Michigan. In 1849, Dow paid taxes based partly on personal property associated with the parcel.West Bloomfield Tax Records in the collection of the Greater West Bloomfield Historical Society Dow spent his final years as a farmer in West Bloomfield after later selling his property to John Coats.Oakland County, Michigan, Oak Hill Cemetery (Older Sections) 1822-1991.

William Dow and his descendants continue to live on Dow ridge (In between Cass Lake and Orchard lake) until the early twentieth century. William Dow died on January 2, 1862, and is buried in Pontiac's Oak Hill Cemetery. =John Coats= John Coats subsequently purchased the island on June 25, 1851, for $1,600.Warranty Deed, Liber 42, Pages 631 & 632, Register of Deeds Records, Oakland County, Michigan. Coats immigrated from Paisley, Scotland, and was the youngest son of cotton thread innovator James Coats.

In the late 1840s, John Coats came to the island to act as an agent for his brothers‚Äô company. He was a founding member of Detroit's St. Andrew's Society in 1849, and co-owner of Jack & Coats, a wholesale and retail dry-goods store on Jefferson Avenue.History of the St. Andrew‚Äôs Society of Detroit: 1849 to 2000. Fred Dunbar Wessells, 2001; Advertisement, Detroit Free Press, Oct. 10, 1850. After Coats's left his business, he built a single-story Greek Revival home on the island's highest point. Coats eventually returned to Scotland when his son James was old enough to attend school.Personal data came from family sources and the diary/recollections of family member Andrew who privately printed this information under the title \\"From a Cottage to The Castle.\\" =Colin Campbell= On August 27, 1856, John Coats sold the island to Colin Campbell for $3,050.Warranty Deed, Liber 58, Pages 457 & 458, Register of Deeds Records, Oakland County, Michigan. Campbell was a successful Scottish dry goods merchant with a store on Jefferson and a founding member of the St. Andrew's Society.Various Detroit City Directories (1845, 1846, 1850, 1852, 1853, 1855, 1860); 1860 Federal Census; 1870 Federal Census; City of Detroit, Michigan 1701‚Äì1922 Vol. II.

Fred Dunbar Wessells, 2001 Campbell's extended family and friends lived on the island for almost 60 years. Extensive gardens and orchards were planted, and many new structures were built. However the island retained some of its historic feel by remaining free from electricity, telephones and indoor plumbing.Campbell Harvey Manuscript. Colin Campbell's wife Caroline was instrumental in the formation of Orchard Lake Community Church, Presbyterian in 1871. =The Wards= David Ward was trained by his father to be a surveyor. In 1863, Ward moved to a farm at Orchard Lake after his prosecution of \\"log thieves\\" caused his children to be harassed. Ward lived at the farm, except in the winter when business required him to return to Detroit.The Autobiography of David Ward. Frederic Fairchild Sherman, New York: privately printed, 1912. Ward's son Willis published his own book, ‚ÄúOrchard Lake and its Island,‚Äù in 1942. The book recounts stories of many Orchard Lake families, and how diverse wildlife once occupied the area. Willis Ward's children, Marjorie Ward Strong and Harold Lee Ward, inherited the island after their father's death in 1943. After Ward Strong died in 1970, the island was conveyed to its present owner, the West Bloomfield School District, for use as an educational nature center.

Each details a particular life experience which led to the poet's examination of nature and the role of poetry. They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism. The Conversation poems were grouped in the 20th century by literary critics who found similarity in focus, style and content. The series title was devised to describe verse where Coleridge incorporates conversational language while examining higher ideas of nature and morality. The works are held together by common themes, in particular they share meditations on nature and man's place in the universe. In each, Coleridge explores his idea of \\"One Life\\", a belief that people are spiritually connected through a universal relationship with God that joins all natural beings. Critics have disagreed on which poem in the group is strongest. Frost at Midnight is usually held in high esteem, while Fears in Solitude is generally less well regarded. Grouping 20th-century literary critics often categorise eight of Coleridge's poems (The Eolian Harp, Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement, This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison, Frost at Midnight, Fears in Solitude, The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem, Dejection: An Ode, To William Wordsworth) as a group, usually as his \\"conversation poems\\". The term was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, who used the subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) to describe all eight.Harper 1928, 3‚Äì27Magnuson 2002, 45 Harper considered these poems as a form of blank verse that is \\"...more fluent and easy than Milton's, or any that had been written since Milton\\".Harper 1928, 11 In 2006, Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent \\"easiness\\", noting that \\"The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un- symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as 'merely talk' rather than rapturous 'song'.\\"Koelzer 2006, 68 Portrait of Coleridge M. H. Abrams wrote a broad description of the works in 1965. He observed that in each, the speaker \\"begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation.\\"Abrams 1965, 527 In fact, Abrams was describing both the conversation poems and later works influenced by them. Abrams' essay has been describes as a \\"touchstone of literary criticism\\".Koelzer 2006, 67 As Paul Magnuson wrote in 2002, \\"Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the 'greater Romantic lyric', a genre that began with Coleridge's 'Conversation' poems, and included William Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, Percy Bysshe Shelley's Stanzas Written in Dejection and John Keats's Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden.\\" In 1966, George Watson devoted a chapter to the poems in his literary analysis Coleridge the Poet. Although stressing that the form was the only type of poetry Coleridge created, he admitted that \\"the name is both convenient and misleading. A conversation is an exchange; and these poems, a dozen or fewer, stretching from 'The Eolian Harp' [...] to 'To William Wordsworth] [...] and perhaps further, are plainly monologues. Those who met Coleridge in his later life, it is true, were inclined to find his conversation arrestingly one-sided, but this will hardly serve as an explanation of what is happening here.\\"Watson 1966, 61 Poems =The Eolian Harp= My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown With white-flower'd Jasmin, and the broad-leav'd Myrtle, (Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!) And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light, Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve Serenely brilliant (such should Wisdom be) Shine opposite! How exquisite the scents Snatch'd from yon bean-field! and the world so hushed! The stilly murmur of the distant Sea Tells us of silence. And that simplest Lute, Plac'd length-ways in the clasping casement, hark! How by the desultory breeze caress'd, Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs Tempt to repeat the wrong! [...] ‚Äî\\"Eolian Harp\\" (lines 1‚Äì17)Coleridge 1921 pp. 100-102 Coleridge began work on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his engagement to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by his visit to the house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding.Ashton 1997, 74 The poem is infused by the fact that Coleridge took an idealised view of his life with Fricker.Doughty 1981, 97 The Eolian Harp was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections.Mays 2001, 231 Coleridge did not stop working on the poem after it was published. He expanded and reworked up until 1817.Holmes 1989, 113 It deals with themes of love, sex and marriage, but is not formed in the usual manner of a love poem. In contrast to the second poem in the series, Reflections, which hints at problems with the relationship, The Eolian Harp focuses on innocence and the poet's anticipation of his conjugal union.Ashton 1997, 75‚Äì76Yarlott 1967, 97 The poem creates a series of oppositional themes with aspects of nature representing each: seduction and innocence, order and chaos. These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks as to how they can be reconciled. These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous to the effects of an Aeolian harpRadley 1966, 44‚Äì46 and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings towards nature.Ashton 1997, 107 In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe.Jasper 1985, 20 However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker,Yarlott 1967, 118 and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.Radley 1966, 46 =Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement= Ah! quiet Dell! dear Cot, and Mount sublime! I was constrain'd to quit you. Was it right, While my unnumber'd brethren toil'd and bled, That I should dream away the entrusted hours On rose-leaf beds, pampering the coward heart With feelings all too delicate for use? Sweet is the tear that from some Howard's eye Drops on the cheek of one he lifts from earth: And he that works me good with unmov'd face, Does it but half: he chills me while he aids, My benefactor, not my brother man! Yet even this, this cold beneficence Praise, praise it, O my Soul! oft as thou scann'st The sluggard Pity's vision-weaving tribe! Who sigh for Wretchedness, yet shun the Wretched, Nursing in some delicious solitude Their slothful loves and dainty sympathies! I therefore go, and join head, heart, and hand, Active and firm, to fight the bloodless fight Of Science, Freedom, and the Truth in Christ. ‚Äî\\"Reflections\\" (lines 43‚Äì62)Coleridge 1921, pp. 106-108 Soon after his autumn 1795 marriage to Sara Fricker, Coleridge left their home in Clevedon, North Somerset. However, he felt guilt at his absence from his wife, and eventually went to live with her family at Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. As he completed The Eolian Harp‚Äîcomposed to commemorate his return to Clevedon‚ÄîColeridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on his absence from Clevedon and later return to be with his wife at Bristol.Ashton 1997, 80‚Äì81 The poem was published in the October 1796 Monthly Magazine,Mays 2001, 260 under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life. A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry.Ashton 1997, 139 Reflections was included in Coleridge's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the anthologies that followed. The themes of Reflections are similar to those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire.Holmes 1989, 103 The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.Radley 1966, 47‚Äì49 Reflections further differs from The Eolian Harp by looking at problems within Coleridge's marriage, especially when the union distracts him from the world outside of his home. The poem expresses desire for solitude and confinement and emphasises the difference between the worlds within and outside of the cottage. Overall, there is focus on the relationship of the private to the public spheres. When engaged with the outside world the narrator is separate from mankind, yet his focus is devoted to helping mankind, which contains religious and political components. The image of \\"One Life\\" compels him to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage, to pursue a path of altruism.Yarlott 1967, 97‚Äì98 =This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison= Well, they are gone, and here must I remain, This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost Beauties and feelings, such as would have been Most sweet to my remembrance even when age Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile, Friends, whom I never more may meet again, On springy heath, along the hill- top edge, Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance, To that still roaring dell, of which I told; ‚Äî\\"This Lime-Tree Bower\\" (lines 1‚Äì9)Coleridge 1921 pp. 178-181 During summer 1797, Coleridge spent time with many of his friends, including John Thelwall, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Thomas Poole, and his wife Sara Fricker. During this time, he suffered an accident in which his foot was burned. As a result, he was left alone at Poole's property underneath a lime tree, while Lamb, the Wordsworths and his wife went on a journey across the Quantocks.Holmes 1989, 152‚Äì153 The first version of the poem was sent in a letter to Southey and was only 56 lines. The first published edition, in 1800, was 76 lines long.Ashton 1997, 105 The poem was revised and published under another name in Southey's Annual Anthology. A later revised edition was included in Sibylline Leaves, Coleridge's 1817 collection of poems.Mays 2001, 350 Within the verse, Coleridge seeks to discover the environment that his friends are exploring because he is unable to join them.Ashton 1997, 105‚Äì107 The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life.Holmes 1989, 154‚Äì155 The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.Yarlott 1967, 111‚Äì113 =Frost at Midnight= Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee, Whether the summer clothe the general earth With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall Heard only in the trances of the blast, Or if the secret ministry of frost Shall hang them up in silent icicles, Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. ‚Äî\\"Frost at Midnight\\" (lines 65‚Äì74)Coleridge 1921 pp. 240-242 Frost at Midnight was written in February 1798. It is based on Coleridge's childhood as well as his friendship with Wordsworth, who first exposed Coleridge to the wild beauty of the Lake District. The poem was published in a small work containing his France: An Ode and Fears in Solitude.Mays 2001, 453 It was rewritten many times; seven versions have been printed. Of these, the 1798 edition contains six concluding lines that were removed from later editions.Mays 2001, 453, 456 The narrator comes to an understanding of nature while isolated with his thoughts. Nature becomes a comfort; however, the poet remembers the loneliness of childhood when he felt isolated from nature and other people, as if living in a world of strangers.Radley 1966, 54‚Äì55 His hope is that his own child, David Hartley, will experience an easier and more harmonious life.Ashton 1997, 136 Although Wordsworth places a similar emphasis on living in harmony with nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view is different from that of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasizes the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.Holmes 1989, 183‚Äì184 =Fears in Solitude= O native Britain! O my Mother Isle! How shouldst thou prove aught else but dear and holy To me, who from thy lakes and mountain-hills, Thy clouds, thy quiet dales, thy rocks and seas, Have drunk in all my intellectual life, All sweet sensations, all ennobling thoughts, All adoration of the God in nature, All lovely and all honourable things, Whatever makes this mortal spirit feel The joy and greatness of its future being? ‚Äî\\"Fears in Solitude\\" (lines 182‚Äì191)Coleridge 1921 pp. 256-263 Fears in Solitude was written after rumors of a French invasion spread across England. Although Coleridge was opposed to Prime Minister William Pitt's control over the British government, he sided with his homeland.Ashton 1997, 133‚Äì134 He began work on the poem during April 1798Mays 2001, 468‚Äì469 and it was first published in a small pamphlet along with Frost at Midnight and France: An Ode. It was eventually printed seven timesMays 2001, 469 with a later printing removing any anti-Pitt sentiment.Ashton 1997, 209 The poem is critical of the corruption Coleridge sees within his own government, but it still displays his loyalty and devotion to England.Holmes 1989, 202 The poem operates in a circular pattern with its beginning and ending at the Stowey dell. By introducing the historically real possibility of an invasion of England, the narrator announces his determination to protect his family and the dell, along with his fellow Britons.Yarlott, 117‚Äì120 Throughout the poem, there is also an emphasis on the simple life and the narrator desires to return to his previous idyllic lifestyle.Radley 1966, 53‚Äì54 =The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem= 'Most musical, most melancholy' bird! A melancholy bird? Oh! idle thought! In Nature there is nothing melancholy. But some night-wandering man, whose heart was pierced With the remembrance of a grievous wrong, Or slow distemper, or neglected love, (And so, poor wretch! filled all things with himself, And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale Of his own sorrow) he, and such as he, First named these notes a melancholy strain. ‚Äî\\"The Nightingale\\" (lines 13‚Äì22)Coleridge 1921 pp. 264-267 The Nightingale was written in April 1798, during the same time Coleridge wrote Fears in Solitude. The poem was included in the Lyrical Ballads, a joint publication with Wordsworth. The nightingale is part of a discussion directed to Wordsworths in which Coleridge refutes the traditional association between nightingales and melancholic feelings because of the bird's appearance in the myth of Philomela.Ashton 1997, 136‚Äì139 In a break from tradition, the nightingales in Coleridge's poem represented an experience he had with the Wordsworths. The narrative is interrupted by a mysterious female character. In this case, the female is not Coleridge's wife, Sara, a fact which separates The Nightingale from the other poems in the series. The work mentions Hartley, the child they had together, as well as a resonant night in which Coleridge viewed and contemplated the moon.Holmes 1989, 191‚Äì193 John Keats would later follow Coleridge's depiction and use of nightingale in \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\".Ashton 1997 pp. 136‚Äì137 =Dejection: An Ode= Joy, virtuous Lady! Joy that ne'er was given, Save to the pure, and in their purest hour, Life, and Life's effluence, cloud at once and shower, Joy, Lady! is the spirit and the power Which wedding Nature to us gives in dower A new Earth and new Heaven, Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud‚Äî Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud‚Äî We in ourselves rejoice! ‚Äî\\"Dejection\\" (lines 64-72)Coleridge 1921 pp. 362-368 Coleridge was living apart from his family in 1802. During this period he intended to write a poem for Sara Hutchinson, with whom he had fallen in love. He sent her the verse on 4 April 1802.Ashton 1997, 201‚Äì202 The original draft was titled \\"Letter to Sara Hutchinson\\", but renamed as Dejection when published. There are many differences between the versions. The original consisted of 340 lines; when published, 139 lines were cut to emphasise two moments in Coleridge's emotional struggle, while many personal elements were removed.Holmes 1989, 309, 318‚Äì319 The poem was published in The Morning Post on 4 October 1802. The date corresponds with Wordsworth's marriage to Mary Hutchinson.Ashton 1997, 202Rossington, Michael. \\"Wordsworth and Coleridge: The Making of the Major Lyrics, 1802‚Äì1804 by Gene W. Ruoff\\". The Modern Language Review, Volume 87, No. 2, April, 1992. 438‚Äì440 Dejection was a response to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode.Watson 1966, 77 It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions.Ashton 1997, 201‚Äì203 The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.Holmes 1989, 298 =To William Wordsworth= Thy long sustain√©d Song finally closed, And thy deep voice had ceased‚Äîyet thou thyself Wert still before my eyes, and round us both That happy vision of belov√©d faces‚Äî Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close I sate, my being blended in one thought (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?) Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound‚Äî And when I rose, I found myself in prayer. ‚Äî\\"To William Wordsworth\\" (lines 104‚Äì112)Coleridge 1921 pp. 403-408 To William Wordsworth commemorates the time when Coleridge stayed with the Wordsworths during the winter of 1806‚Äì1807, and recalls when William Wordsworth read his newly completed The Prelude. Coleridge wrote his poem in response during January 1807, to capture his feelings about his friend's poem.Ashton 1997, 239‚Äì240 Portions of the verse were printed in the 1809 Friend, however Wordsworth did not wish it to be made public due to the private nature of Coleridge's thoughts.Mays 2001, 815 Eventually, it was published in Coleridge's 1817 collection Sibylline Leaves.Ashton 1997, 239 The poem begins by summarising the themes of The Prelude, and develops into a discussion of Wordsworth's understanding of his beliefs and their relationship with nature.Ashton 1997, 240 In the poem, Coleridge is self-critical in a near masochistic manner, holding his poetry and thoughts as inferior to Wordsworth. This is partly because Coleridge believed that Wordsworth was able to find bliss from solitude while he was unable to find anything but pain.Yarlott 1967, 1‚Äì2 Coleridge discusses his youthful hopes to become a great poet and how his ability to write has diminished over time.Ashton 1997, 240‚Äì241 The poem's admiration of Wordsworth's ability is rendered without jealousy, though he is scornful of his own.Watson 1966, 80‚Äì81 Themes The Eolian Harp examines Coleridge's understanding of nature within the concept of his \\"One Life\\", an idea that came from reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with the nature and mans' understanding of the universe. In particular, The Eolian Harp express an unease with David Hartley's ideas about necessity.Jasper 1985, 35‚Äì36 Within Reflections, the idea of \\"One Life\\" compels the narrator to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage and of nature in order to pursue a path of helping mankind.Yarlott 1967, 98 This Lime-Tree Bower continues the conversation poems theme of \\"One Life\\" by linking Coleridge's surroundings with the walk his friends went on. Although they are all separated, Coleridge connects to his distant friends by their mutual experience and appreciation of nature. Frost at Midnight uses the idea of \\"One Life\\" as the poem describes the idea life that Coleridge's child will experience in the countryside. Coleridge hoped that the boy would become a \\"child of nature\\" and raised free of the constraints that come from a disconnection from nature.Sisman 2006, 218‚Äì219 Fears in Solitude describes the unity of mankind and nature, which manifests in the form of fearing for his fellow countrymen in times of invasion. This idea of \\"One Life\\", according to Abrams, \\"best epitomize the Romantic constellation of joy, love, and the shared life\\".Abrams 1973, 434 Both The Eolian Harp and Reflections deal with similar understandings of nature but differ in approach. By Reflections, Coleridge questions his right to simply enjoy nature. The image of nature and other themes reappears in Fear in Solitude, and the later poem even recreates the \\"Valley of Seclusion\\" image. Similarly, the compulsion to enter into the world and help mankind is included, but it is altered from being motivated by guilt to a warning message against a possible invasion from outside forces. As such, Fear in Solitude does not seek to leave the location to help mankind, but to stay as a protector over his family.Yarlott 1967, 118‚Äì119 This Lime- Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also deal with a similar understanding of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower form the basis for a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.Watson 1966, 74 Critical response The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridge's finest.Bloom 1971, 202 The final ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper in 1928 as the \\"best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved, as natural-seeming as prose, but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet.\\"Harper 1928, 15 In 1966, Virginia Radley argued, \\"Although no conversation poem can rightly be said to stand equally with the poems of high imagination [...] certainly \\"Frost at Midnight\\" and \\"This Lime-tree Bower ...\\" both have within them that quality of heart so essential to these latter poems. Because of this quality, and because of the striking effectiveness of their imagery, these poems can be said to be the true harbingers of Coleridge's greatest poems\\".Radley 1966, 56 Others agree on the strength of Frost at Midnight. Richard Holmes wrote in 1989 that the poem \\"is one of the most intricately structured of all the Conversation Poems\\".Holmes 1989, 183 Rosemary Ashton argued in 1997 that the poem is \\"one of [Coleridge's] most delightful conversation poems\\".Ashton 1997, 134 Agreeing with this view in 2006, Adam Sisman believes that Frost at Midnight is \\"perhaps the most beautiful of Coleridge's 'conversation poems'\\".Sisman 2006, 219 Other poems in the series received praise, with George Watson, in 1966, claiming that To William Wordsworth \\"is the last pure example that Coleridge's poetry affords of the conversation poem [...] the poem is extravagant in its very being.\\"Watson 1966, 80 Also, Holmes describes The Eolian Harp as a \\"beautiful Conversation Poem\\".Holmes 1989, 95 Not all of the poems have been well received. Watson believes that Fears in Solitude \\"shows how precarious Coleridge's new achievement was. It is a shameless return to the older, effusive manner, evidently written in a white heat of patriotic indignation against the degradation of English public opinion during the French wars, and it is only by stretching charity that it can be considered a conversation poem at all.\\"Watson 1966, 71 Holmes simply claims Fears in Solitude as \\"one of the most difficult of [Coleridge's] Conversation Poems\\".Holmes 1989, 194 In discussing The Nightingale, Ashton writes that, \\"Bantering though this is, and, however, beautiful the final lines about Hartley are, 'The Nightingale' is as a whole a less successful poem than the other conversation poems. It has rather a blank at the centre, just where the others pivot on a significant controlling idea.\\"Ashton 1997, 137 Notes References * Abrams, M.

Construction and commissioning Machias originally was authorized as a patrol gunboat with the hull number PG-161, but she was redesignated as a patrol frigate with the hull number PF-53 on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as a Maritime Commission Type T.S2-S2-AQ1 hull on 8 April 1943 by Froemming Brothers, Inc., at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was launched on 22 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. Richard Bernays, and commissioned on 29 March 1944. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944‚Äì1945= Ready for sea duty by 17 July 1944, Machias patrolled off the Middle Atlantic states and escorted a convoy to Aruba in the Netherlands West Indies before joining Escort Division 33 at Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 August 1944. With that division, she steamed to New York City to become a unit of Task Group 70.7, then assembling to depart for the Pacific Ocean. The task group departed New York on 16 August 1944, and by 28 August 1944 it had transited the Panama Canal en route Bora Bora. On 25 September 1944, Machias left the convoy to escort the Royal Navy infantry landing ships HMS Empire Arquebus and HMS Empire Battleaxe to the New Hebrides Islands and the Solomon Islands to disembark troops. She rejoined her escort division at Morotai on 23 October 1944 and commenced antisubmarine patrols in the waters surrounding the Molucca Islands. On 15 November 1944, following a brief stay at Mios Woendi for boiler repairs, Machias steamed with her escort division for the Philippine Islands. She arrived on 18 November 1944 and, after further repairs, took up antisubmarine patrols off Mindanao, primarily in Surigao Strait. She continued in this role until 4 December 1944, when she returned to convoy escort duty. For the next three months she escorted ships and carried military personnel to and from New Guinea, the Philippines, the Marshall Islands, and the Caroline Islands. Machias departed Eniwetok for Seattle, Washington on 19 March 1945 for an overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington. Upon completion of her overhaul in June 1945, she proceeded to Kodiak in the Territory of Alaska. Earmarked for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan, Machias joined her sister ships , , , , , , , and in getting underway from Kodiak on 13 June 1945 bound for Cold Bay, Alaska, where they arrived on 14 June 1945 to enter Project Hula. Training of Machiass new Soviet Navy crew soon began at Cold Bay.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 25. =Soviet Navy, 1945‚Äì1949= Machias was decommissioned on 12 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with nine of her sister ships, the first group of patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Machias was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-4 in Soviet service. On 15 July 1945, EK-4 departed Cold Bay in company with nine of her sister ships - EK-1 (ex- Charlottesville), EK-2 (ex-Long Beach), EK-3 (ex-Belfast), EK-5 (ex-San Pedro), EK-6 (ex-Glendale), EK-7 (ex-Sandusky), EK-8 (ex-Coronado), EK-9 (ex- Allentown), and EK-10 (ex-) - bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union. EK-4 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 27, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-4 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but in October 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-4 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet- American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953‚Äì1971= Reverting to her original name, Machias remained at Yokosuka in a caretaker status in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until 14 January 1953, when the United States loaned her to Japan.

The U.S. Navy struck Machiass name from the Navy List on 1 December 1961, and the United States transferred Nara outright to Japan on 28 August 1962. Decommissioned on 31 March 1966, Nara was redesignated YTE-3 that day and entered non-commissioned service as a non-self-propelled pierside training ship. She was sold for scrapping in 1969.

The Howard League for Penal Reform Canterbury is an organisation based in Christchurch, New Zealand, that lobbies for prison reform and works in Canterbury prisons. It is based on the British Howard League for Penal Reform. The Howard League was formed by Blanche Baughan and two others in 1924, to fight for a fair and justice penal system. She noted, in a dictated piece written in the 1950s: The New Zealand Howard League for Penal Reform was started in 1924 in Christchurch by three people all convinced of the need. One soon resigned, but the others carried on and got information from the Howard League in England. '' We began to hold meetings and to be well scoffed at, and badly reported in the newspapers ‚Äì the name Howard being interpreted as that of E.J. Howard, M.P., a prominent Labourite. By 1928, however, we had managed to get groups interested in other centres and emphasised the fact that the League was for penal reform, and that we were not an ‚Äòaftercare society‚Äô, though the Prisons Board wanted us to be. We affiliated ourselves to the English League and began at last to get sensible notices from the Press. Teething troubles quickly began and how our baby League managed to weather them I hardly know; but we had a few faithful members and survived a war, a slump, hostility from the authorities, contempt from some of the public and complete indifference from most of it. We went on writing letters to the Press, taught it how to spell the strange words ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù and ‚Äúpsychiatry‚Äù and gradually convinced people that we were not a set of sentimental softies, but were seriously asking for less mass treatment, more individual attention to prisoners and altogether a more scientific approach to crime and criminals. We also convinced our Courts that compared with figures obtained from England they were too freely sending to Borstal and prison, instead of making proper use of the newer methods of probation of which New Zealand was still very shy. Prison libraries were much improved through our activities, prison concerts and lectures more freely allowed in conjunction with the WEA. We urged the establishment and training of women police, proper understanding and care of the mentally crippled (which we had not yet got) in spite of the 1928 Mental Hospitals Amendment Act, and perhaps most important of all, kept on discovering bit by bit and exposing the pretences and shame that covered much of our real penal system and lulled our people into believing that it was really efficient. The League has certainly in these ways gradually educated New Zealand towards accepting the much better policy introduced in the last few years by our present Controller General of Prisons and Under Secretary of Justice. We have always, of course, advocated the abolition of Capital Punishment and it was the League that initiated the success agitation against the hanging of the three Nuie Islanders recently convicted. We have never been very numerous, but we can claim at least to have been faithful to maintaining the continuity of our aims\\" (cited from upcoming book on NZ Howard League. The League was active in Christchurch from 1924 to 1974, and over the years a number of people were prominent in the organisation. One involved from the start until his death was Charles (C.R.N.) Mackie, also known for his pacifist work (see citation in Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, that does not mention Mackie's key role in the early years of the Howard League). Later, Lincoln Efford was among the leading lights of the organisation. The Howard League in Canterbury fronted many attempts to improve the penal system in New Zealand. The anti-flogging, anti- capital punishment stance also included a push towards 'scientific' methods of prison reform, including a rehabilitative approach, psychological assessments of prisoners and humane treatment. After the war, all Howard League branches were involved with ex-conscientious objectors in advertising the conditions in NZ prisons. Once the hardline Controller of Prisons, Berkeley Dallard, retired in 1951, the prison system began a long process of reform. The Howard League got more voice, and by the 1960s the Canterbury Branch had largely run out of steam, as so many of its proposals were introduced. However, almost as soon as it folded, things started deteriorating again, and the Auckland Branch remained the lone voice for many years. The Canterbury branch was relaunched by Kathie Dunstall MNZM in February 1998 to work on reform of the penal system and especially to fight against the huge increase in prison numbers. Fact sheets on the prison system and regular newsletters were sent out to a large national mailing list of around 500 names. The Canterbury Branch has, more recently, assisted in setting up new branches in Wellington and Dunedin. As the title 'New Zealand Howard League for Penal Reform' has been taken over by an Auckland group, the new branches have reformed as the National Coalition of Howard Leagues (inc).

Plot There is no overarching story, other than a series of short stories, each linking to Bond street.

With its beginnings in the 1970s, P-pop is a growing genre. History =Beginnings (1960s‚Äì1970s)= Filipino pop songs mainly referred to songs popularized since the 1960s, especially those in the ballad form, by major commercial artists like Pilita Corrales and Nora Aunor, and in the 1970s by Basil Valdez, Freddie Aguilar and Rey Valera. Singer-songwriters Ryan Cayabyab and Jos√© Mari Chan rose to fame in the 1970s by composing original English love songs alongside modern Tagalog songs. Pioneer pop groups in the same decade include Manila sound groups APO Hiking Society and Hotdog. =Golden age of Filipino music= In the 1980s, disco group VST & Co. and pop icon Gary V. gave rise to dance-pop in the mainstream. =Prominence of rock-acoustic bands, belters, and balladeers. (mid-1990s to present)= The early to mid-1990s saw the emergence of the pop-rock group, Eraserheads, considered as a turning-point in the OPM music scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential bands such as Yano, Siakol, Parokya ni Edgar, Grin Department, Rivermaya, Moonstar 88 and Hungry Young Poets, each of which mixes the influence of a variety of pop and rock subgenres into their style. Filipino rock continues to flourish at present with newer bands such as Hale, Cuesh√©, Sponge Cola, Chicosci, Kamikazee and Urbandub, and the emergence of the country's first virtual band, Mistula. Though only some of the spearheading bands are still fully intact, many old members have formed new bands such as Pupil, Sandwich, and Bamboo. A few band members such as Kitchie Nadal, Barbie Almalbis, and Rico Blanco have established steady solo careers. Though rock bands have been dominating the mainstream since their commercialization in the '90s, acoustic groups were still regularly showcased in the live band scene such as Side A, True Faith, Neocolours, South Border and Freestyle popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop. Popular acoustic acts like Nina, Juris (of MYMP) and Aiza Seguerra also prove the diversity of Filipino pop. Solo belters and balladeers such as Regine Velasquez, Sharon Cuneta, Joey Albert, Donna Cruz, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Jaya, Jolina Magdangal and Martin Nievera had regular exposure on television and radio. =Re-emergence of R&B; and novelty songs (2000s to present)= From the early 2000s onwards, Kyla, Nina and Jay R began to be pioneers of the contemporary R&B; music with Gloc-9 and Abra of hip-hop genre. Local sing and dance groups SexBomb Girls and Viva Hot Babes began to popularize novelty songs among the masses. =Pinoy pop renaissance (2010s)= Since 2010, the genre of Pinoy pop drastically changed as the usual rock bands and novelty songs from the 1990s and 2000s started to fade out of the mainstream, creating the new pop genre without any influence of rock and hip-hop. In 2010, Little Big Star 2nd runner-up and YouTube star Charice became the first Asian to peak on the top 10 (at No. 8) of the Billboard 200 for her debut album.Philippine Daily Inquirer, 22 May 2010, \\"Charice debuts at No. 8 on Billboard \\" She was also one of the first Asian artists to have a song peak at No. 1 for Billboard's Dance/Club Play Songs.Sanchez, R. J., Manila Bulletin, 24 May 2010, \\"Charice happy with chart performance of her album, song\\" Notable pop artists of the 2010s include Toni Gonzaga, Moira Dela Torre, Yeng Constantino and Sarah Geronimo whose songs \\"Tala\\" and \\"Kilometro\\" were chosen by CNN Philippines as best songs of the decade. =The rise of P-pop idol groups (2020s)= From the influence of K-pop and J-pop, a new era of P-pop was born. The Philippines' first idol group MNL48, a sister group of the J-pop group AKB48, started a new era for P-pop when they debuted in 2018. Following them is the all-boy idol group SB19 who also debuted in 2018. They are the first Filipino act trained by a Korean entertainment company under the same system that catapulted K-pop artists into global stardom. SB19 is considered to be the first P-pop idol group to chart on the Billboard Next Big Sound and Billboard Social 50. On November 20, 2019, SB19 made history by being the first Filipino artist to chart and debut on the Billboard Next Big Sound chart debuting and peaking at No. 5. The Next Big Sound chart tracks \\"the fastest accelerating artists during the past week, across all major social music sites, statistically predicted to achieve future success,\\" according to the Billboard website. On December 3, 2019, the group broke the all-time record of the longest stay at the No. 1 spot of Myx Daily Top Ten with \\"Go Up\\" staying at the top spot for 53 non-consecutive days. International recognition In 2019, P-pop idol group MNL48 performed at AKB48 Group Asia Festival 2019, the first held at Bangkok, Thailand on January 27, while the second one was held at Shanghai, China on August 24. Such performances catapulted MNL48 to the international stage, especially with other fans of their 48G counterparts. That same year, MNL48's Abby Trinidad was the group's representative on the New Year's Eve special of NHK's \\"Kohaku Uta Gassen\\", where along with other 48G counterparts, performed \\"Koi Soru Fortune Cookie\\". This is the third time a Filipino performer appeared on the said show, alongside Gary Valenciano and the band Smokey Mountain. In 2020, Sarah Geronimo's single \\"Tala\\" entered at No. 12 on the U.S. Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. In 2020, P-pop boy band SB19 became a Billboard Social 50 mainstay after peaking at No. 15 on the chart, likely due to the music video of their single \\"Alab\\".https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart- beat/8550040/sb19-social-50-next-big-sound-chart-filipino-boy-band-profile MNL48, on the other hand, announced the formation of BABY BLUE, the group's newest sub-unit on September 1, 2020. Alongside with that announcement is the release of the sub-unit's single \\"Sweet Talking Sugar\\", released in collaboration with Tower Records Japan, a major Japanese music retailer. A nationwide tour in Japan of the said sub-unit is announced by HalloHallo Entertainment and Tower Records Japan, which will commence after the COVID-19 crisis.

It was designed to trick email users into opening a mail message purportedly containing a picture of the tennis player of the same name, while actually hiding a malicious program. The worm arrives in an email with the subject line \\"Here you have, ;0)\\" and an attached file called AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs. When launched under Microsoft Windows, the file does not display a picture of Anna Kournikova but launches a viral VBScript program that forwards itself to everybody in the Microsoft Outlook address book of the victim. Users of other operating systems (MacOS, Linux, etc) were not affected. De Wit created Anna Kournikova using a simple and online available Visual Basic Worm Generator program by an Argentinian programmer called [K]Alamar. While similar to the ILOVEYOU worm that struck a year earlier in 2000, the Anna Kournikova worm did not corrupt data on the infected computer. Still, it affected millions of people and caused problems in email servers around the world. Apparently, the author created the worm in a matter of hours. \\"The young man had downloaded a program on Sunday, February 11, from the Internet and later the same day, around 3:00 p.m., set the worm loose in a newsgroup.\\" De Wit turned himself in to authorities in the town of Sneek located in the northern Dutch province of Friesland. \\"By the time he understood what the worm did, he had conferred with his parents and decided to turn himself in to the police.\\" The efforts of a virus writer working undercover for the FBI, David L. Smith (author of the Melissa virus, who was still serving his sentence), assisted in tracking down OnTheFly's real identity. De Wit turned himself in to the police in his hometown Sneek on February 14, 2001, after he posted a letter of confession on a website and a newsgroup of player Anna Kournikova (alt.binaries.anna-kournikova) dated February 13. In it, he admitted creating the virus using a toolkit and explained his motivations as to see whether the IT community had learned their lesson to better secure systems in the aftermath of previous virus infections. But besides admission and regret he also attributed external blame for the rate of spreading on the beauty of the tennis player (he had pinups of her on his website) and blamed those who opened the email, writing \\"it's their own fault they got infected.\\" A few days later, Mayor Sieboldt Hartkamp of Sneek made a tentative job offer to De Wit in the local administration's IT department, saying the city should be proud to have produced such a talented young man. De Wit was tried in Leeuwarden and was charged with spreading data into a computer network with the intention of causing damage, a crime that carried a maximum sentence of four years in prison and a fine of 100,000 guilders (US$41,300). The lawyers for Jan de Wit called for the dismissal of charges against him, arguing that the worm caused minimal damage. The FBI submitted evidence to the Dutch court and suggested that US$166,000 in damages was caused by the worm. He denied any intent to cause damage. De Wit was sentenced to 150 hours of community service. The 18-year-old Buenos Aires programmer who created the Worm Generator toolkit, removed the application's files from his website later in February 2001. \\"Once they heard my alias being mentioned on television, my friends recommended that I do so,\\" he told ZDNet Latin America in an interview.

In 1993, the station was rebranded as The Breeze, the format of the station was changed to Easy Listening. In 1995 The Breeze was taken over by the More FM Group. The More FM Group was taken over by CanWest in 1997 and after CanWest merged with RadioWorks The Breeze became part of the RadioWorks group of stations. The format of this station was later rolled out across New Zealand by rebranding heritage stations as The Breeze and in some regions local shows replaced with network shows based from Auckland. The Breeze in Wellington was not initially affected by any of these changes and was a live and local station 24 hours a day 7 days a week, however the night show is now the Auckland-based network show. In mid-2015 the 891 kHz frequency was changed to oldies music station Magic.

The first project to use an arbitration committee, and the most widely covered, is the English Wikipedia. Each of Wikimedia's projects are editorially autonomous and independent. Therefore, over time, other Wikimedia projects have established arbitration committees. Arbitration committees are established by a project's editors and are usually elected by their community in annual elections. They address misconduct by administrators, access to various advanced tools, and a range of \\"real world\\" issues related to harmful conduct that can arise in the context of a Wikipedia project. Arbitration committees generally have the authority to impose binding sanctions and can determine which users have access to special permissions. The first such arbitration committee was created by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he formerly held as owner of the site. The arbitration committee acts as a court of last resort for disputes among editors. It has been described in the media variously as 'quasi-judicial' or a Wikipedian 'High/Supreme Court', although the Committee states that it is not, nor pretends to be, a court of law in the formal sense. It has decided several hundred cases in its history. Members of the committee are appointed by Wales either in person or email following advisory elections; Wales generally chooses to appoint arbitrators who received the most votes. The Foundation's Arbitration Committee process has been examined by academics researching dispute resolution, and has been reported in public media in connection with various case decisions and Wikipedia-related controversies.  History  In October 2003, as part of an etiquette discussion on Wikipedia, Alex T. Roshuk, then legal adviser to the Wikimedia Foundation, drafted a 1,300-word outline of mediation and arbitration. This outline evolved into the twin Mediation Committee and Arbitration Committee, formally announced by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003. Over time the concept of an \\"Arbitration Committee\\" was adopted by other communities within the Wikimedia Foundation's hosted projects. When founded, the Committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each. , it had decided around 371 conduct cases, with remedies varying from warnings to bans. Attention and controversies A statistical study published in the Emory Law Journal in 2010 indicated that the committee has generally adhered to the principles of ignoring the content of user disputes and focusing on user conduct. The same study also found that despite every case being assessed on its own merits, a correlation emerged between the types of conduct found to have occurred and the remedies and decisions imposed by the committee. In 2007, an arbitrator using the username Essjay resigned from the Committee after it was found that he had made false claims about his academic qualifications and professional experiences in a New York Times interview. Also in 2007, the committee banned Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Carl Hewitt from editing the online encyclopedia. In May 2009, an arbitrator who edited under the username Sam Blacketer resigned from the committee after it became known that he had concealed his past editing in obtaining the role. In 2009, the committee was brought to media attention as a result of its decision to ban \\"all IP addresses owned or operated by the Church of Scientology and its associates, broadly interpreted\\", as part of the fourth Scientology-related case. Such an action had \\"little precedent\\" in the eight-year history of Wikipedia and was reported on several major news services such as The New York Times, ABC News, and The Guardian. Satirical news-show host Stephen Colbert ran a segment on The Colbert Report parodying the ban. In 2015, the committee received attention for its ruling pertaining to Gamergate, in which one editor was banned from the site indefinitely and several others were banned from topics relating to Gamergate or gender. In June 2015, the committee removed advanced permissions from Richard Symonds, an activist for the British party the Liberal Democrats. Symonds had improperly blocked a Wikipedia account, and associated its edits with former Chairman of the Conservative Party Grant Shapps, and leaked this to The Guardian. Shapps denied ownership of the account, calling the allegations \\"categorically false and defamatory\\". Symonds said in an interview that he stands by his actions. A 2017 study found that the committee's decision making was mostly unaffected by extra-legal factors such as nationality, activity/experience, conflict avoidance, and time constraints. The same study found that the committee's decision making was affected much more by time constraints than that of conventional courts.  Arbitration Committees on sister projects  The Swedish Wikipedia early \\"thing\\" of 24 November 2002 became the first instance akin to a prototype arbitration committee on any Wikipedia language version, effectively making Swedish Wikipedia the first decentralised franchise while the rest of Wikipedia was still under Jim Wales' direct personal supervision. In 2004 a proper Arbitration Committee was founded on the French Wikipedia, and in 2007, on the German and Polish Wikipedias.

A family try to relax during a weekend holiday in the country.BFI  Film & TV Database  QUIET WEEK END (1946) It was a sequel to the 1941 film Quiet Wedding, with several of the actors reprising their roles. It was based on the 1941 play Quiet Weekend and shot at Welwyn Studios and in Welwyn Garden City. Plot The Royds drive down to their spacious cottage in the country. Denys informs his mother Mildred, the matriarch of the family, that he has invited Rowena Hyde. She shows up in a chauffeur-driven car. Also making an appearance is patriarch Arthur Royd's friend Adrian Barrasford. The pair go fishing. When Adrian reveals he is very fond of Mary Jarrow, Arthur invites him to supper, as Mary will be there. Miranda Bute, nearly eighteen years old, is another surprise guest. Mildred becomes a bit concerned, as she knows that Miranda, her niece, is attached to Denys (though he himself is oblivious), making for an awkward situation. When Miranda discovers that Denys has turned down an attractive job offer because there was \\"just no money in it\\", she is sure there is \\"something behind this\\". Then she encounters Rowena, who informs her that Denys has accepted a well-paying job in Hollywood as a private secretary, rather than pursuing a career as a scenic designer. She eventually quarrels with Denys over his decision. Adrian takes Arthur and Mildred's advice to make his intentions known, only to have Mary misconstrue his proposal as an offer to sell her his house. He, on the other hand, thinks she has turned down his offer of marriage. Denys and Rowena go to a party of her upper-class friends. He becomes annoyed when she chooses Paul Perry (Denys's future employer) instead of him as her partner in a game. Meanwhile, Arthur, Adrian and Sam sneak off to do some poaching; Miranda joins them, and after much searching, they catch a large salmon. However, they are spotted and chased by the authorities. Miranda flags down a passing car, which turns out to be driven by Denys. He lies to a policeman to keep her out of trouble and takes her home. Arthur and Adrian eventually show up, but Sam is caught and taken into custody. Arthur has to get Adrian, in his official capacity as the local justice of the peace, to allow him to bail out their fellow poacher. The next morning, Miranda is delighted to learn that Denys has changed his mind and declined the Hollywood job. It soon becomes apparent that he has also drastically changed his view of Miranda as well. Adrian, emboldened by his experience the night before, proposes to and is accepted by Mary. The Royds depart.

There are two major forms in North America, the 'Morning Cloud' a hybrid of desert willow (Chilopsis linearis) for desert hardiness and color, and northern catalpa (Catalpa speciosa), and the 'Pink Dawn' variety formed as a hybrid of desert willow and either yellow catalpa (Catalpa ovata) or northern catalpa (Catalpa speciosa). Both forms were originally thought to be hybrids of Desert Willow and Southern Catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides). The name is nothogeneric, or a combination of the two parents' names. Leaves are lanceolate, long and wide, almost always in whorls of three. The trumpet- shaped flowers are long and frilly.Brenzel, Kathleen N. 1997 Sunset Western Garden Book, Chitalpa entry.

It is also highly drought-resistant, a trait inherited from the desert willow. Chitalpa are also carriers of the Xylella Fastidioas bacterium.

Rusanov of the Botanic Garden of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences in Uzbekistan (then part of the Soviet Union) in 1964.David L. Morgan: Chitalpa Trees ‚Äì Bred for the Desert, on Learn2Grow site They were introduced in the US by Robert Hebb of the New York Botanic Garden in 1977. Unbeknownst to the scientist, the Chilopsis used for the hybrid was infected with the bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. Due to the fact that all Chitalpas today were bred from the original root stock, all species have the pathogen. Hebb brought cuttings of two clones and grew them at the Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, N.Y. The cuttings began to flower in the third growing season, showing two color forms. These two forms were distributed in 1982, and all living plants of this intergeneric hybrid in North America are believed to have originated from this single introduction.

Commonwealth of Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that criminal defense attorneys must advise noncitizen clients about the deportation risks of a guilty plea. The case extended the Supreme Court's prior decisions on criminal defendants' Sixth Amendment right to counsel to immigration consequences. The duties of Counsel recognized in Padilla are broad. After Padilla, if the law is unambiguous, attorneys must advise their criminal clients that deportation will result from a conviction. Also, if the immigration consequences of a conviction are unclear or uncertain, attorneys must advise that deportation \\"may\\" result. Finally, attorneys must give their clients some advice about deportation: counsel cannot remain silent about immigration. After Padilla, there has been significant litigation in the lower courts about whether attorneys are required to advise their criminal clients about other consequences of convictions. Background Jos√© Padilla was born in Honduras in 1950. He later emigrated to the United States and became a lawful permanent resident.Petitioner's brief to the US Supreme Court: http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-651_Petitioner.pdf Padilla served in the US military during the Vietnam War and received an honorable discharge. As of 2010, Padilla had been a lawful resident in the United States for more than 40 years. In 2001, Padilla was working as a commercial truck driver when he was arrested in Kentucky for transporting marijuana. His defense attorney told him that he \\"did not have to worry\\" about the conviction affecting his immigration status, so he pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea bargain.Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1478 (2010). However, this advice was incorrect, as Padilla's deportation was virtually automatic.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1478. In 2004, Padilla filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been given bad advice by his attorney. The Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by the Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, guarantees criminal defendants legal counsel. Strickland v. Washington, a subsequent decision, further requires that defendants receive effective counsel. If defendants receive ineffective assistance of counsel, they may be able to get their convictions overturned. Traditionally, defense attorneys were required to advise their clients only of the direct consequences of convictions: the sentence likely to result from a plea bargain, the maximum sentence one might face at trial, and the risk of conviction at trial. The Sixth Amendment does not require attorneys to tell their clients about any collateral consequences: civil penalties such as loss of professional licenses, loss of government benefits, and loss of voting rights. Before Padilla, deportation was considered a collateral consequence, and thus not a consequence about which attorneys had to provide legal advice. Padilla argued that the bad advice he had been given was ineffective assistance and therefore his conviction breached the Sixth Amendment. Padilla won his case in the Kentucky Appellate Court, but the Commonwealth requested the Kentucky Supreme Court hear the case on discretionary review. That court applied a harsh version of the collateral consequences rule, reasoning that whether Padilla‚Äôs attorney failed to advise him or affirmatively misadvised him before his plea made no difference.Commonwealth. v. Padilla, 253 S.W.3d 482, 484-85 (Ky. 2008). The court held that even affirmative misadvice about deportation provided no grounds for relief under Strickland.Padilla, 253 S.W.3d at 485. As the Supreme Court agreed to hear it, the case posed two questions: (1) whether the mandatory deportation that results from a guilty plea to trafficking in marijuana is a \\"collateral consequence\\" and counsel is thereby relieved of an affirmative duty to advise his client about it in accordance with the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment; and, (2) assuming deportation is a \\"collateral consequence\\", whether counsel's gross misadvice about deportation constitutes a ground for setting aside a guilty plea that is induced by that advice. Ultimately, the Court re-framed the case in a way that made the collateral consequences doctrine irrelevant. Decision The Supreme Court reversed the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision. The Supreme Court held that criminal defense attorneys are duty-bound to inform clients of the risk of deportation under three circumstances. Firstly, if the law is unambiguous, attorneys must advise their criminal clients that deportation will result from a conviction. Secondly, if the immigration consequences of a conviction are unclear or uncertain, attorneys must advise that deportation may result. Thirdly, attorneys must give their clients some advice about deportation; counsel cannot remain silent about immigration consequences.Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1483-84 (2010). =Majority opinion= Writing for the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens began his analysis by tracing the history of federal immigration law and its close historical connection between a criminal conviction and deportation: ninety years ago, deportation occurred only for a narrow class of crimes and even then was discretionary. Over time, that discretion has been limited, and the class of deportable offenses has expanded. Now, a conviction for drug trafficking means removal is \\"practically inevitable.\\"Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1480. As a threshold matter, the Court declined to apply the direct/collateral consequences distinction that had developed in the lower courts, a distinction that the Supreme Court itself had never recognized.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1481. The Court instead emphasized that deportation is a unique and \\"particularly severe penalty.\\"Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1481 (internal quotation and citation omitted). In addition, although deportation is civil rather than criminal, it has been closely connected to the criminal process for nearly a century. Given the connection, it was difficult for the Court to classify deportation as a direct or collateral consequence.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. Regardless of whether the collateral consequences rule is an appropriate way of analyzing ineffectiveness cases, a question that the Court did not decide, the Court found it ‚Äúill-suited‚Äù to evaluating Padilla‚Äôs deportation-related claim.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1481-82. The court thus concluded that advice about deportation is not categorically removed from analysis under the Court's decision in Strickland v. Washington and so applied Strickland's two-pronged test to Padilla's claim. The bulk of the Court's analysis focused on the attorney's performance under Strickland. In analyzing the performance prong, the Court first examined professional norms and practices. It determined that the weight of current professional norms indicates that attorneys must advise their clients of the risk of deportation. Specifically, professional standards promulgated by the American Bar Association, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the Justice Department, and legal scholars all indicate that an attorney must advise his or her client of the risk.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. The Court's opinion also quotes from an amicus brief indicating that authoritative treatises, state and city bar publications, and public defender organizations \\"universally\\" have the same requirement. See Brief for Legal Ethics, Criminal Procedure, and Criminal Law Professors as Amici Curiae, pp. 12-14. Moreover, avoiding deportation may be more important to the client than even averting the maximum sentence of incarceration.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1483. Given the gravity of deportation, the Court's expectation was that counsel would consult available practice guides and advise his or her client accordingly. Moving beyond the facts of Jose Padilla's situation, the Court decided two further issues. The Court decided counsel may not remain silent but must provide some advice about immigration consequences.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1484. The Court reasoned that a contrary holding would invite attorneys to offer no advice about circumstances that might lead to their clients‚Äô exile. Given this seriousness and the minimal duty imposed, offering clients no advice would be unconscionable and a violation of the Sixth Amendment guarantee. The Court mitigated this newly imposed duty somewhat by holding that when the immigration consequences are not certain and clear, a criminal defense attorney must simply advise the client that a conviction may affect the client's immigration status. The Court reasoned that immigration law is a separate legal field that is complex and may be unfamiliar to criminal defense attorneys. The Court acknowledged Justice Alito‚Äôs point that the deportation consequences of a criminal conviction are often unclear but reasoned that this complexity affected the scope and nature of counsel‚Äôs advice, rather than obviating the duty to give advice.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1483, n. 10. =Concurrence= Concurring in the judgment, Justice Alito largely agreed with the Court's result but took issue with the breadth of its holding.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1487 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment). Alito agreed with the Court that affirmative misadvice gives rise to a valid claim under Strickland, reasoning that requiring attorneys to know the limits of their own expertise is not too high a standard.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1492-94. Alito also concurred that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to say when a conviction may trigger deportation but would apply that same, limited requirement regardless of the clarity of the law.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1494. Alito parted company with the majority‚Äôs attempt to distinguish between immigration consequences that are \\"succinct, clear, and explicit\\" and those that are \\"not... straightforward\\".Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1490 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). He pointed out with numerous examples that determining the correct advice about immigration consequences is often complex.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1488-90. Conversely, to an attorney unversed in immigration law, a single statute read in isolation may seem to resolve an issue, but a careful attorney would need to know how the statute had been interpreted by courts.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1490. Also, immigration practice guides indicate that it is not easy to tell whether a conviction will trigger removal.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1490-91. In sum, Alito thought that immigration law was too complex to be easily reduced to the majority‚Äôs clear/unclear dichotomy. =Dissenting opinion= Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion. Scalia agreed with Justice Alito‚Äôs reasoning about the complexity of immigration law, but concluded that the Sixth Amendment‚Äôs text and the Court‚Äôs decisions limit the amount of advice counsel is under a duty to provide.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1494-95. Scalia also saw no logical stopping point to a holding that requires counsel to give advice about collateral consequences of a conviction.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1496. Scalia quoted Alito‚Äôs list of collateral consequences that might be included in an expansive duty to inform, including civil commitment, government benefits, and professional licenses.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1496 (quoting Alito‚Äôs concurrence at p. 1488). Finally, Scalia objected to constitutionalizing an issue that might be better handled through legislation.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1494, 1496-97. Impact = Immigration consequences = The biggest direct impact of the Padilla decision is that criminal defense attorneys must advise their non-citizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. In cases for which the law is unclear, lawyers do not have to do significant legal research, but may simply say that a conviction may lead to the client's deportation. The Supreme Court noted that even as the Supreme Court of Kentucky denied Padilla's claim based on the collateral consequence of deportation, the Commonwealth amended its plea bargain agreement forms to include deportation as a possible outcome. The case along with the 2015 United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit Case No. 13-1994 Castaneda v. Souza with its companion cases Castaneda v. Souza and Gordon v Johnson, which allowed bail for immigrants previously held in mandatory detention, greatly expanded the rights of immigrants caught within the deportation and removal system. = Other collateral consequences = Padilla may have effects on ineffectiveness claims regarding other collateral consequences. In his concurring opinion, Justice Alito lists \\"civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits, ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or professional licenses\\" as areas where the Court's holding in Padilla may be extended.Padilla, 130 S.Ct. at 1488 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).

History Hotel Capri in 1973. In 1955, President Batista enacted Hotel Law 2074, offering tax incentives, government loans and casino licenses to anyone wishing to build hotels in excess of $1,000,000 or nightclubs for $200,000 in Havana. This bill brought Meyer Lansky and his \\"associates\\" in the mafia flooding to the city to take advantage. The Hotel Capri de Havana was one of the first to be built. Located on Calle 21, 1 Mp. 8 Vedado, only two blocks from the Hotel Nacional, it opened in November 1957. With its 250 rooms, the nineteen-story structure was one of the largest hotel/casinos in Havana during its heyday. It boasted a swimming pool on the roof. Owned by mobster Santo Trafficante, Jr. of Tampa, Florida, the hotel/casino was operated by Nicholas Di Costanzo, racketeer Charles Turin (aliases: Charles Tourine, Charley \\"The Blade\\"), and Santino Masselli of the Bronx NY(aliases:\\"Sonny the Butcher\\"). After it opened, George Raft was hired to be the public front for the hotel's club during his gangster days in Cuba.Havana Before Castro by Peter Moruzzi, p.176 It was believed that he owned a considerable interest in the club.Cuban Information Archives, Document 0126 The hotel was designed by architect Jose Canaves and owned by the Canaves family. The hotel, along with its famous casino, was leased to American hotelier, \\"Skip\\" Shephard. The Hotel Capri was nationalized by the Cuban government in October 1960, and the casino was closed.Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States - In the Matter of the Claim of Horwath and Horwath September 20, 1967 Hotel Capri in 1974.

Commissioning Hashkiveinu is the result of a commissioning project from 1943 to 1976 by Cantor Dr. David Putterman for a series of contemporary music at Park Avenue Synagogue in New York City. Putterman believed strongly that the synagogue music‚Äîparticularly American synagogue music‚Äîwould only endure through adaptation and creativity.

Wilzig (March 11, 1926 ‚Äì January 7, 2003) was a survivor of the Holocaust, oil tycoon, commercial banker and advisor to Nobel Prize winner writer Elie Wiesel. Early life Siggi Wilzig was born in 1926 in Krojanke (now Krajenka) in West Prussia. In 1943, the entire family was sent to Auschwitz because they were Jewish.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145657,00.html Siggi, then 16, had already spent 3 years doing forced labor. One of his brothers was beaten to death by the Gestapo while the family was living in a Nazi controlled Ghetto with other Jewish families. Upon coming to the camp, Wilzig lied to Nazi guards, stating his age to be 18, not 16. This was his only chance for survival, as he was deemed old enough to work. At Auschwitz, 59 members of his family were killed over a three-year period.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145657,00.html After only two days at the concentration camp, his father was also killed. Siggi had to identify his father from a pile of corpses; his mother and grandmother were sent straight to the gas chamber, while his grandfather and one of his brothers were beaten to death, while two others were killed by Nazis guards just two days before the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp was liberated. Twenty times Siggi Wilzig faced the cold stare of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele during the selection process, and each he narrowly escaped death.http://www.newsweek.com/id/106883/output/print/ Although he had previously worked in the supply warehouses, nicknamed Canada by survivors, his last four months in Auschwitz were spent working in a laundry, where the clothes of murdered Jews were washed and redistributed to the Germans.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145657,00.html Wilzig was the only child in his Jewish school class of 1,500 studentshttps://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/classified/paid-notice-deaths- wilzig-siggi-b.html to survive the Nazis' genocidal efforts. In all he spent 1 years at Auschwitz and 6 months in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Life after the Holocaust On May 5, 1945, Wilzig ‚Äî whose forearm bore the number the Nazis tattooed on him, 104732, was rescued from the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Mauthausen, Austria, by the U.S. Army. He was so grateful of his American rescuers that he spent the next two years assisting U.S. Army Intelligence and The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in tracking down Nazi Guards and Gestapo operatives responsible for so many deaths. He immigrated to America in 1947, weighing only 90 pounds, with nothing in his pockets and knew no one. His first job was shoveling snow in the Bronx after a heavy blizzard that winter.http://www.forward.com/articles/9218/ In the 1950s Wilzig held odd jobs including working as a bow-tie gluer and presser in a Brooklyn sweatshop, a traveling school notebook salesman and a furniture store manager. He met Naomi Sisselman, nine years his junior, and the two were married in a civil ceremony on New Year's Eve 1953.http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/17/Floridian/The_art_of_passion.shtml The couple had three children over the course of their marriage: sons Ivan and Alan and daughter Sherry. Building an empire In the early 1960s, he played the stock market and invested his meager savings, along with money borrowed from his father-in-law. He made smart investments, buying up cheap Canadian oil and gas stocks. One stock that particularly caught his interest was the Wilshire Oil Company of Texas. Along with his colleagues, Wilzig made a large investment in the oil and gas producer and was elected a member of Wilshire's boards in 1965. Six months later, at the age of 39, he was elected President and Chief Executive of the company.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/classified/paid-notice-deaths- wilzig-siggi-b.html During his tenure, the Wilshire Oil Company acquired a large interest in the Trust Company of New Jersey, a consumer- and small- business-oriented bank. Thus with his shared interests, Wilzig became a bank Director in 1969 and was elected Chairman and President just two years later. Since 1971, the bank's assets have grown from $200 million to more than $4 billion. Wilzig retired as president and chief executive in 2002 and was succeeded by his son, Alan. He remained chairman until his death. At the end of 2003, nearly a year after Wilzig's death, the bank was sold to North Fork Bank for $726 million in an all-stock transaction. 2 years later North Fork Bank was sold to Capital One.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145657,00.html Philanthropy In addition to his business interests, Wilzig was very active in humanitarian and philanthropic affairs, particularly those related to the Holocaust. In 1980, he was appointed as a founding member of the Holocaust Memorial Council in Washington. He was the first Holocaust survivor to lecture at West Point, where after his lecture to the cadets, he received a standing ovation. When Nobel Prize winner Holocaust author Elie Wiesel was appointed to head the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council by President Jimmy Carter, he asked that ‚ÄúWilzig be the first person to serve with him.‚Äù Siggi was also founding director and fellow of the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School of Yeshiva University. In recognition of his contributions to the United States and for serving humanity while honoring the heritage of ancestors, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1998.https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/11/local/me- passings11.3 Siggi's successes enabled him to support a number of charities, He also supported the Jersey City Medical Center, and funded a brand new state of the art hospital that now bears his name, as well as served on the Board of Directors of the Daughters of Miriam Home for the Aged and the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center. He even raised over 100 million in Israeli bonds, due to his hard work he was awarded Prime Minister's Medal of the State of Israel.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/classified/paid-notice-deaths- wilzig-siggi-b.html Siggi Wilzig died in 2003 due to his several year battle with multiple myeloma.

A whole town comes under suspicion when two grisly murders are carried out‚Äîparticularly members of the local sports club. Plot While playing tennis at a posh club in a town near London called Oakley Park, young and flirty Molly Stevens attracts considerable interest. The men ogle her and the women detest her. She is later found dead, strangled with a stocking. The local police chief requests the help of Scotland Yard, so Detective Superintendent Mike Halloran is sent to investigate. The locals, however, resent having an outsider poking into their affairs. A book of love poems, including an inscription from a Peter Crowley, is found in the victim's flat. There is also a photo of a group of men together with Molly and Fiona Dixon, a young woman from the prominent Dixon family. Her father, although shocked to learn that his daughter knew the \\"trashy\\" Molly, will not let Halloran question her. Halloran eventually learns that Molly left Peter Crowley for a married man, Mark Roper, who is the club's secretary. Roper denies any involvement, and also claims that he was giving nurse Elizabeth Fenner a lift to the hospital at the time of the murder. The coroner reveals Molly was two months pregnant. Dr. John Fenner, the local Canadian expat physician who certified the death, is asked by Halloran why he neglected to report that fact. Fenner claims he was trying to avoid a scandal for Roper and the club. Elizabeth turns out to be the doctor's niece and also a Canadian expat. She confirms that Roper gave her a lift, but this later turns out to be a lie - a result of her attempts to protect the reputation of her uncle, who left his practice in Toronto after a misdiagnosis led to a patient's death. This is something the locals are unaware of, but Roper knows and is using this secret to blackmail the doctor. Roper, always bragging about his wartime heroics as a RAF fighter pilot, is revealed by Halloran to have been nothing but a lowly ground crew member, who was dishonourably discharged after theft and is currently heavily in debt. The club demands Roper's resignation. He turns up at a party, gets drunk and starts a fight. Leaving the party and going for a walk, Fiona is ambushed and strangled to death. Her body is placed in the trunk of Dr. Fenner's car. Halloran finds out that Peter Crowley has been treated for schizophrenia. Peter flees to a church, climbing to the top of the steeple and threatening to jump. Halloran ascends the steeple to prevent the suicide, risking his own life in the process, and manages to convince Peter not to kill himself. A fire brigade turntable ladder rescues the two just as they are about to fall.

Childs studied the genetics of adrenal hyperplasia, Crigler‚ÄìNajjar syndrome, and propionic acidemia. He is known for his collaboration with William H. Zinkham, which demonstrated that Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic disease. He is best known for a collaboration with Ronald Davidson and Harold Nitowsky, which demonstrated random inactivation of one of the two X-chromosomes in mammalian female cells, a mechanism of dosage compensation. Childs was the author of many editorial pieces on genetic counseling, genetic screening, and behavioral genetics. He was a coauthor of The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, published in four volumes. In his book Genetic Medicine: A Logic of Disease, published in 1999, he argues that in the future, all medicine, or medical theory, must be based on the individuality of gene-environment interaction.

Writings Harrison is best known for a number of influential writings on religion and the origins of modern science. He has argued that changing approaches to the interpretation of the Bible had a significant impact on the development of modern science. He has also suggested that the biblical story of the Fall played a key role in the development of experimental science. His earlier work traces changing conceptions of religion in the Western world. Harrison contends that the idea of religions as sets of beliefs and practices emerged for the first time in the 17th century. This earlier work on religion was revisited in his 2011 Gifford Lectures, where he argued that current conceptions of both 'science' and 'religion' are relatively recent Western inventions, and that contemporary relations between science and religion are to some extent already built into the categories themselves. Rethinking the relations between science and religion, on this account, is not a matter of considering relations between scientific and religious doctrines, but of rethinking the ways in which science and religion themselves are currently conceptualised. Similarly, he also contends that the concept of Western values is a quite recent, 20th century Western emergence, despite being traced back to classical antiquity and the New Testament.\\"An Eccentric Tradition: The Paradox of 'Western Values'\\" In 2017, Harrison demonstrated that the Credo quia absurdum was a quote misattributed to Tertullian in the Early Modern Period as a part of anti-religious and anti-Catholic polemics.Harrison, Peter. \\"‚ÄúI Believe Because it is Absurd‚Äù: The Enlightenment Invention of Tertullian's Credo.\\" Church History 86.2 (2017): 339-364.

(Vigevano 1738 ‚Äì Florence 22 December 1808) joined the Austrian army, became a general officer, and led the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont for three years, including its unsuccessful campaign against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796. In early 1797, he was given command of the army of the Papal States, but was defeated at Faenza. Early career Born in Lombardy in 1738, Colli enlisted in the army of the Habsburg Monarchy as an infantry officer in 1756 at the age of 18. During the Seven Years' War, he fought at the Battle of Prague in 1757 and the Battle of Torgau in 1760, and was wounded in the latter action. He received the noble title Freiherr in 1764. By the War of the Bavarian Succession he led a battalion in the Caprara Infantry Regiment 48 with the rank of major. In 1779 he was appointed oberst (colonel). During the Austro-Turkish War he fought at Osijek and Belgrade, where he was wounded again. He received promotion to general-major in December 1788. He commanded Josefstadt fortress in 1789. Colli was thin, of normal height and with big blue eyes. His contemporaries described him as intelligent, courageous, and cool under fire. He sometimes needed to be carried around on a stretcher because of his war wounds.Boycott-Brown, pp. 135‚Äì136. Italian service In 1793, the Austrian government transferred Colli to the Sardinian-Piedmontese army and promoted him to Feldmarschal-Leutnant (lieutenant general) that December. In this capacity, he led the Sardinian army from 1793 to 1796. He led Piedmontese soldiers in action at Saorge on 12 June 1793 and again on 24 April 1794. In November 1795 he fought at the Battle of Loano. Relations between the Sardinian kingdom and their Austrian allies were strained. As an Austrian soldier leading a foreign army, Colli felt that he was in an awkward situation, working for two masters.Boycott-Brown, p. 135. In the spring of 1796, Emperor Francis II of Austria appointed Colli's friend, Feldzeugmeister Johann Beaulieu, to lead the Austrian army in Piedmont. But because the Austrian government gave Beaulieu secret instructions warning him not to trust the Piedmontese, the two generals were unable to work out a coherent allied strategy.Boycott-Brown, pp. 136‚Äì137. When Beaulieu launched an attack on the extreme right flank of the French army, Bonaparte immediately thrust between the Austrian and Sardinian armies. In the Montenotte Campaign, the French general mauled the Austrian army and drove it northeast, then turned west and relentlessly pressed the Piedmontese back. Colli's rear guards ably defended themselves at the Battle of Ceva and at San Michele Mondovi, but the Piedmontese were soundly beaten at the Battle of Mondov√¨ on 21 April. By signing the Armistice of Cherasco on 28 April, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia took his country out of the First Coalition. This event released Colli from his obligations to Piedmont and he joined Beaulieu's army as a division commander. Since he led the soldiers of the northern flank on a retreat through Milan and Cassano d'Adda, he missed the Battle of Lodi in May.Boycott-Brown, p. 305, 316. He commanded Beaulieu's left wing at the Battle of Borghetto at the end of May.Boycott-Brown, p. 351. Colli's duties with the Austrian army in Italy ended when Feldmarschall Dagobert von Wurmser replaced Beaulieu in early July. The following year found Colli leading the army of the Papal States. Just days after Pope Pius VI fled rome, however, a French force led by Claude Victor crushed Colli's new command at the Battle of Castel Bolognese on 3 February 1797, from which the Papal army never recovered and future resistance was futile. This forced Pope Pius VI to sue for peace.Smith, p. 133. Colli also served in the Neapolitan army.Fiebeger, p. 8. From 1804 to 1807 he served as an Austrian envoy in Italy and died at Florence on 22 December 1808. References * Boycott-Brown, Martin. The Road to Rivoli.

The museum houses the largest collection of historical women aviator artifacts in the world.  History  First known as \\"The Ninety-Nines\\", the MWP was established in New York City by 99 women pilots during 1929. Its headquarters moved from New York to Oklahoma City in 1955. In 1972, the museum was formally established as the \\"Resource Center,\\" that included a library, archives, museum and oral/video history collection. The quantity of artifacts soon outgrew its allotted space, so a separate museum was created and opened to the public in 1999.  Collections  The museum is the only one in the world dedicated to female pilots (another museum focusing on women in aviation is International Women's Air & Space Museum in Cleveland, Ohio). Artifacts include historical papers, personal items, video and oral histories, photos, memorabilia and other notable artifacts from pioneering women aviators worldwide. The museum collection and exhibits provide insight into the role women pilots played in the development of aviation and their historical footprint. The museum is home to personal artifacts of Amelia Earhart and information about her pioneering aviation career. The museum is open Monday through Saturday, 9 AM to 5 PM.

Construction and commissioning Bath originally was authorized as a patrol gunboat with the hull number PG-163, but she was redesignated as a patrol frigate with the hull number PF-55 on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as Maritime Commission Type T.S2-S2-AQ1 Hull 1480 on 23 August 1943 by Froemming Brothers, Inc., at Milwaukee. She was launched on 14 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Fred R. E. Dean, then moved in an incomplete state to New Orleans, where she was completed by Pendleton Shipyards. She was commissioned on 9 September 1944 with a United States Coast Guard crew and Commander John R. Stewart, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Bath departed New Orleans on 25 September 1944 and conducted her shakedown training out of Bermuda before proceeding to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she arrived on 1 November 1944 for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Sea trials off Rockland, Maine, and further repairs at Philadelphia followed before she departed the Delaware Capes on 30 December 1944 and proceeded to New York City to report for duty with Task Group 20.9 under the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier. Based at the Eastern Sea Frontier base at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, and attached to Escort Division 38, Bath departed on 6 January 1945 in the escort of a convoy bound for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and returned to New York on 25 January 1945. She then operated out of Tompkinsville on antisubmarine barrier patrol through mid-May 1945, often in company with other patrol craft. She also kept approaching vessels from interfering with the convoy lanes into and out of New York. Detached from this duty on 17 May 1945, Bath arrived at Ocean Weather Station 10 in the North Atlantic Ocean (at ) on 18 May 1945 to relieve the destroyer escort there, but was herself relieved the same day. Returning to New York City, Bath underwent repairs and alterations at the Mariners' Harbor shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation on Staten Island, and received orders to the Pacific Ocean on 11 June 1945. On 13 July 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed that she would be transferred to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy under Lend-Lease at Cold Bay in the Territory of Alaska in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan. Accordingly, Bath set out for Cold Bay on 14 July 1945. She transited the Panama Canal on 22 July 1945 and reached San Pedro, California, on 30 July 1945. Proceeding on to Seattle, Washington, Bath departed for Cold Bay on 28 August 1945. Training of her new Soviet crew soon began.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 35. =Soviet Navy, 1945‚Äì1949= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Bath was decommissioned on 4 September 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union immediately along with her sister ships , , and , the last of 28 patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately,According to Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , which includes access to Soviet-era records unavailable during the Cold War, Project Hula ships were commissioned into the Soviet Navy simultaneously with their transfer from the U.S. Navy; see photo captions on p. 24 regarding the transfers of various large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)s) and information on p. 27 about the transfer of , which Russell says typified the transfer process. As sources, Russell cites Department of the Navy, Ships Data: U.S. Naval Vessels Volume II, 1 January 1949, (NAVSHIPS 250-012), Washington, DC: Bureau of Ships, 1949; and Berezhnoi, S. S., Flot SSSR: Korabli i suda lendliza: Spravochnik (\\"The Soviet Navy: Lend-Lease Ships and Vessels: A Reference\\"), St. Petersburg, Russia: Belen, 1994. Bath was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-29 in Soviet service.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 35, 39. On 5 September 1945, all ship transfers to the Soviet Union were ordered stopped, although training for ships already transferred was allowed to continue. Accordingly, EK-29 remained at Cold Bay along with EK-26 (ex- Gloucester), EK-28 (ex-Newport), and EK-30 (ex-Evanvsille) for additional shakedown and training until 17 September 1945. All four of these ships departed in company bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, the last four of the 149 Project Hula ships to do so. Too late for World War II service with the Soviet Navy, EK-29 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 34, 35, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-29 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 15 November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-29 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953‚Äì1971= Reverting to her former name and placed out of commission in reserve at Yokosuka, Bath remained inactive there until loaned to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) on either 13 or 23 December 1953. Sources disagree the JMSDFs name for the ship, variously reporting it as or . She was redesignated JDS Maki (PF-298) on 1 September 1957. On 1 December 1961, the U.S. Navy struck Baths name from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register, and the United States transferred the ship to Japan permanently on 28 August 1962. On 31 March 1966, the JMSDF decommissioned the ship, simultaneously renamed her YTE-9, and placed in service as a non- commissioned pier-side training ship. She was sold to the Chin Ho Fa Steel and Iron Company, Ltd., of Taiwan on 13 December 1971 for scrapping.

It was the most deadly mass murder in Philadelphia history. Ten people were shot in a crack house in the 800 block of Lex Street in West Philadelphia. Seven of them died.  Suspects  The murders received substantial public attention, and four suspects, Jermel Lewis, Sacon Youk, Hezekiah Thomas and Quiante Perrin, were quickly charged. However, there was insufficient evidence for prosecution, and after 18 months in jail, charges were dropped. The men later sued for wrongful arrests, and eventually received a $1.9 million settlement from the city. In 2002, four different men were charged in the case, brothers Dawud and Khalid Faruqi who denied being involved in the murder, and Shihean Black and Bruce Veney, who pleaded guilty. All four were later convicted. The prosecution made a plea deal with the brothers: They were given life sentences rather than the death penalty. The third is serving multiple life terms as well, and the fourth, Veney, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in exchange for testifying against the other three suspects, he drove the suspects to the scene but did not actually involve himself in the shooting.  Cause  Originally, police had thought the shooting was due to a drug turf war, but in 2002 when the four other men were arrested, it was revealed that the issue was over a car. When the four men were arrested, Black told police that he had traded a Chevrolet Corsica along with $300, for Porter's Dodge Intrepid, Porter was one of the victims. Porter did not know how to use the Corsica's stick shift and blew out the clutch. After these issues Porter went to Dawud Faruqi who had traded a pistol for the Dodge Intrepid. Porter wanted his Dodge back, but refused to pay for the damaged clutch on the Corsica. Reportedly, Porter took his car back the next day with an extra set of keys. It was this bad car deal that led to the shooting on December 28. Black told police that the night of the massacre was meant to gather or corral the victims, but when Dawud's mask fell off they began shooting to protect his identity. In the end, seven were dead and three were injured.  The Lex Street Massacre: The True Story of the Worst Mass Murder in Philadelphia History  The mass shooting was explored in a 2007 book titled The Lex Street Massacre: The True Story of the Worst Mass Murder in Philadelphia History, by Antonne Jones. Jones took time studying and investigating the case to create his book which includes interviews from judges, lawyers, and even from the men convicted. His novel goes through the suspense of the case from the first wrongful convictions to the eventual imprisonment of the murderers. The book has interviews with Shihean Black who mentions the effects that living in decaying projects of Philadelphia had on him, and lead to his loss of respect for life and its value. This novel explores the causes, effects, and the importance of the massacre.

Instrumentation ·∏§alil is scored for solo flute, piccolo and alto flute, timpani, five percussionists (four snare drums, bass drum, four tom toms, a pair of cymbals, high and low crash cymbals, high and low gongs, chimes, tam- tam, high and low triangles, four woodblocks, whip, xylophone, glockenspiel, and vibraphone), harp, and strings. In the 1987 version for flute, piano, and percussion the timpani becomes optional and the keyboard percussion parts (xylophone, glockenspiel, and vibraphone) are eliminated. Bernstein notes, ‚ÄúPiccolo and Alto Flute, in the orchestral version, must sound from a distance and be unseen.\\" Dedication In the score to ·∏§alil, Bernstein writes: > This work is dedicated ‚ÄòTo the spirit of Yadin and to his fallen brothers‚Ä¶ > ·∏§alil (the Hebrew word for ‚Äòflute‚Äô) is formally unlike any other work I > have written, but is like much of my music in its struggle between tonal and > non-tonal forces. In this case, I sense that struggle as involving wars and > the threat of wars, the overwhelming desire to live, and the consolations of > art, love and the hope for peace. It is a kind of night-music, which, from > its opening 12-tone row to its ambiguously diatonic final cadence, is an > ongoing conflict of nocturnal images: wish-dreams, nightmares, repose, > sleeplessness, night-terrors and sleep itself, Death‚Äôs twin brother. I never > knew Yadin Tannenbaum, but I know his spirit.Leonard Bernstein, ·∏§alil: > Nocturne for Flute, Percussion, and Piano (New York and London: Boosey and > Hawkes, 1981): iii. Structure While Bernstein dabbled in dodecaphonic writing in Kaddish and Dybbuk, ·∏§alil is rooted in twelve-tone techniques. The flute solo falls silent near the end of the work, as if to suggest the wastefulness of Yadin‚Äôs death, and the alto flute embedded within the orchestra or placed off stage plays a duet with the solo viola. Halil was received well by critics; the horror that Bernstein attempted to convey was heard. A Washington Tribune critic commented, ‚Äú[·∏§alil is] a brooding, terrific element which whispers of nightmares and nameless horrors.‚ÄùHumphrey Burton, Leonard Bernstein (London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1994): 465.

Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 400,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has distributed nearly 500,000,000 meals to recipients in 76 countries with a mission to end hunger. History Rise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed as Stop Hunger Now in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and John Hewitt, a tax expert and entrepreneur, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as: \\"Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world‚Äôs most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources.\\" Areas of focus Rise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: nourishing lives, responding to emergencies, empowering communities and growing the movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world's most vulnerable populations. =Nourishing lives= Rise Against Hunger supports safety net programs for nourishment and skills training to help the world's most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with vocational education and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. =Responding to emergencies= Rise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, the organization aims to provide food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include Hurricane Dorian in 2019, the ongoing Venezuelan refugee crisis, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, 2016 Hurricane Matthew, Syrian conflict, South Sudanese conflict and 2010 Haiti earthquake. =Empowering communities= In order to create long- term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. It works to increase agricultural production and incomes through programs that promote improved farming methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food. =Growing the movement= Part of Rise Against Hunger's mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. The organization works with volunteer groups from communities of faith, corporations, schools and civic clubs to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger encourages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030. Meal packaging program The assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by Kraft Heinz Company Foundation that includes 20 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal is typically 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years. Rise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much-needed nutrition. Grant program Rise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.

The park, which is bounded by Greenwich, Chambers, and West Streets, covers . The park also has community gardens and a large playground and hosts many community events. History The city of New York proposed the construction of a municipal parking lot on a disused dump site located just south of the Independence Plaza apartments in the late 1970s. Residents of TriBeCa, including former New York City councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, protested the planned parking lot and campaigned for a new city park in their neighborhood. At the time, the tiny, triangular Duane Park was one of the few green spaces in TriBeCa. The activists successfully persuaded officials to build a park, which was called Washington Market Park, instead of the parking lot. Washington Market, Ca 1890 In the late 1970s, a federally-funded Community Block Development Grant was obtained from the city and used to design and build the existing park. Lee Weintraub, then an architect with the city's Housing Preservation and Development Corporation (HPD), was assigned to design the park. A not-for-profit corporation, Washington Market Community Park, Inc, was created in 1978 to oversee the park, to be run by a Board of Directors elected by the community. Washington Market Park opened in April 1983. It is named for the former Washington Market, which functioned as New York City's most important wholesale produce market, reaching its peak between 1880 and 1910. New York City tore down the nearby, former Washington Market buildings in the 1960s when the wholesale produce industry relocated to Hunts Point in the Bronx. In 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg included Washington Market Park as one of twelve parks in Lower Manhattan which received a combined $25 million in upgrades from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.

It was spurred by ratifications of ILO Convention No. 138Text of ILO Convention 138 on the minimum age for employment and ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour. The World Day Against Child Labour, which is held every year on June 12, is intended to foster the worldwide movement against child labour.  Background  The International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations body that regulates the world of work, launched the World Day Against Child Labour in 2002 in order to bring attention and join efforts to fight against child labour. This day brings together governments, local authorities, civil society and international, workers and employers organizations to point out the child labour problem and define the guidelines to help child labourers. According to ILO's data, hundreds of millions of girls and boys throughout the world are involved in work that deprives them of receiving an adequate education, health, leisure and basic freedoms, violating this way their rights. Of these children, more than half are exposed to the worst forms of child labour. These worst forms of child labour include work in hazardous environments, slavery, or other forms of forced labour, illicit activities such as drug trafficking and prostitution, as well as involvement in armed conflict.  Significance  The Significance of the World Day Against Child Labour is to pay attention to the problem of child labour and to find ways to eradicate it. The day is used to spread awareness about the harmful mental and physical problems faced by children forced into child labour, whole over the world.

On Android, it works up to and including Lollipop, version 5 of Android.  Product  SlideIT allows a user to enter a word by sliding a finger or stylus from letter to letter on a virtual keyboard, lifting only between words. SlideIT uses advanced pattern recognition and error-correction algorithms together with a complicated language model and word database to ensure maximum accuracy of the text in output, while allowing the user a lot of freedom and inaccuracy in entering text. This allows for text input at much higher rates than normal mobile phone and other small touch-screen keyboards.  Developer  Dasur is a technology company that specializes in complex mathematical applications. Over the last 20 years, Dasur has developed a powerful pattern recognition engine which can be the basis for many applications. Based on this engine, Dasur has developed this generation of text input solutions for mobile phones and PDAs.  History  The first version was released on 2007 as two separate keyboards, ThumbKey and SlideIT. ThumbKey's technology brought the touchscreen method with the option of using only one hand. Dasur's ThumbKey used an algorithm that allowed users to just press in the general vicinity of the required key for the intended word to appear on the screen. The algorithm processed the typed letters and its disambiguation feature suggested the intended word and also displayed additional possibilities next to the keyboard. In 2009 the two keyboards were merged into one product branded SlideIT which offers an 'ABC' mode with the ThumbKey unique algorithm and the 'Slide' mode with the sliding algorithm. At the end of 2010 Dasur released a new version for Symbian and in early 2011 a version 3.0 for the Android was released.  Languages  The keyboard can be customized with a primary and several secondary languages, and the user can rotate between them at any time by pressing a button. In addition, Slide it supports a third tier of languages accessible by long- pressing the language button. In effect, this multi language support is a key differentiator to other keyboards for users regularly switching between three, four or more languages. Rotate between the two or three most used languages, have the other ones quickly available.  Speed  The average computer user, using a standard full-size QWERTY keyboard, types 33 words per minute.Karat, C.M., Halverson, C., Horn, D. and Karat, J. (1999), Patterns of entry and correction in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems, CHI 99 Conference Proceedings, 568‚Äì575. PDAs and smartphones allow much slower speeds. Sliding style keyboards for touch screens can increases typing speed by 30-40% and yields potential typing speeds of more than 50 words per minute ‚Äì matching the average speed of a professional typist. A comparable sliding style keyboard, Swype, as of late 2010, holds the world speed record for text input into a mobile phone.  Availability  SlideIT can be run on any Android phone or tablet computer, Windows Mobile and Symbian S60 v5. SlideIT for iPhone and Windows Tablet PC will be available soon.

The Annales laureshamenses or Annals of Lorsch (AL) are a set of Reichsannalen (annals of the Frankish empire) that cover the years from 703 to 803, with a brief prologue. The annals begin where the \\"Chronica minora\\" of the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede leaves off‚Äîin the fifth year of the Emperor Tiberios III‚Äîand may have originally been composed as a continuation of Bede. The annals for the years up to 785 were written at the Abbey of Lorsch (whence the name), but are dependent on earlier sources. Those for the years from 785 onward form an independent source and provide especially important coverage of the imperial coronation of Charlemagne in 800. The Annales laureshamenses have been translated into English.By P. D. King in Charlemagne: Translated Sources (Kendal: 1987), 137‚Äì45. Manuscript history An eight-leaf copy of the Lorsch annals for 703‚Äì803 was produced probably in 835 by a single scribe.Rosamond McKitterick (2004), History and Memory in the Carolingian World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 107‚Äì10. The \\"Sankt-Paul codex\\", as it is now called, which is the sole surviving quire of an otherwise lost manuscript, was still in the library of Sankt-Blasien in 1790, when it was edited by Aemilianus Ussermann,Roger Collins (2005), \\"Charlemagne's Imperial Coronation and the Annals of Lorsch,\\" Charlemagne: Empire and Society, ed. Joanna Story (Manchester: Manchester University Press), 54‚Äì64 (with images on 60‚Äì1). bishop of Bamberg, in his collection of documents illustrative of \\"Alemannian\\" German history, Germaniae sacrae prodomus seu collectio monumentorum res Alemannicas illustrantium. In 1809, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, the monks of Sankt-Blasien moved, with their library, to the Abbey of Sankt-Paul im Lavanttal. In 1820 G. H. Pertz sought the manuscript for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, but it could not be found and so the MGH version was based on Ussermann's printed edition of 1790.MGH, SS I, pp. 19‚Äì39. The manuscript was recovered by 1889, when Eberhard Katz edited a new version.In Jahresbericht des √∂ffentl. Stiftsuntergymnasiums der Benedictiner zu Sankt Paul in K√§rnten (Sankt Paul: 1889). Katz described the codex (today lost again), dated it to the ninth century and suggested it originated at the Abbey of Reichenau because of a marginal notice of the burial of Charlemagne's brother-in-law Gerold of Vinzgouw there. A fragment of a manuscript conserved in Vienna (now no. 515 in the √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek) also contains a section of the Lorsch annals for mid-794 to 803, and was copied around 803. This manuscript too appears to originate at Reichenau, as it is written in Alemannian script. It was discovered in Vienna in 1551 by Wolfgang Lazius. Katz argued that both the Vienna fragment and the Sankt-Paul codex are derived from an earlier exemplar. Though the Sankt-Paul codex is later, it is not a copy of the Vienna, since it contains errors that must originate in some other exemplar. There is an ongoing debate whether the Vienna fragment represents the original copy of the annalist, who was probably from the region of Alemannia. Four distinct scribal hands have been identified in the Vienna fragment, corresponding to different entries: *A (fol. 1r, fol. 1v l. 18 to 2v l. 13): 794 (fragment), second half of 795, all of 796‚Äì97 *B (fol. 1v ll. 1‚Äì18, fol. 2v l. 14 to 3r l. 1): first half of 795 *C (fol. 3r l. 2 to 4r l. 17): all of 799‚Äì801 *D (fol. 4r l. 18 to 5r l. 10): all of 802‚Äì3 The post-785 annals in the Sankt-Paul and Vienna manuscripts do not show any special connexions with Lorsch and were probably composed elsewhere. They may have been written nearly continuously from 785, or in spurts with months or years between additions. Textual transmission Chart of the textual history of the Annales laureshamenses.Collins (2005), 59, fig. 4. The Lorsch annals for the years up to 785 are almost identical with the Annales mosellani and also with those of the Fragmentum chesnii, which also shares with the Sankt-Paul version a brief extension to the year 786. From the year 785, the Lorsch annals being dating events since the death of Gregory the Great (605). The 785 entry contains a reference to the \\"present\\", indicating perhaps that the original compilation of annals 703‚Äì85 was made in the latter year. The annals for 785‚Äì803 were compiled independently and not necessarily at Lorsch. This original stem‚Äîthe Lorsch Annals of 785‚Äîfrom which all three annalistic traditions diverge after 785 was probably composed at the Abbey of Lorsch. Textually it is related to the Annales nazariani, Annales guelferbytani, and Annales alamannici, all depending on the earlier, hypothetical \\"Murbach Annals\\", composed at Murbach Abbey (founded 727) and covering the years up to 751. Since the Lorsch annals of 785 were based on an erroneous copy of these Murbach annals, events in the 750s are consistently mis-dated.Collins (2005), 70. The frequency of references to the abbey of Lorsch between the years 764 and 785 suggests that the work of compilation done in 785 was performed there. The Abbey of Gorze is also mentioned, but less frequently, and the death of only one of its abbots is mentioned, whereas all the Lorsch abbots of the period receive obituaries. These Lorsch annals may have been circulated in batches of years, before they were completed. The nature of the Sankt-Paul codex supports the contention that unfinished batches of annals were circulated in libelli (booklets) comprising single quires. A copy of the Lorsch annals eventually found its way into the Marca Hispanica, where it was used by the compiler(s) of the Chronicle of Moissac. The Belgian historian Fran√ßois-Louis Ganshof believed that the Chronicle of Moissac represented a fuller version of the Lorsch annals that had been extended down to 818. More likely, the years 803‚Äì18 in the Moissac chronicle are derived from another source with a different geographic focus.Collins (2005), 69. The so-called \\"York annals\\" or \\"Northern annals\\" that cover the years 732 to 802, and which comprise a section of the Historia regum of Simeon of Durham, contain a reference to the golden lettering of the poetic epitaph on the marble memorial Charlemagne provided to commemorate Pope Hadrian I. This may have been derived from the Lorsch annals, which are the only continental source to provide the detail. Authorship and viewpoint Heinrich Fichtenau argued that the author of the Lorsch annals was Richbod, a pupil of Alcuin of York and a member of Charlemagne's court circle until about 784. From 785 he was the abbot of Lorsch and from 791 the bishop of Trier. He died in 804. Knowledge of the Synod of Frankfurt, which Richbod attended in 794 and which condemned adoptionism in the same terms as a treatise of Alcuin's, is displayed in the annals under that year. There is no evidence, however, that the annals that best correspond to Richbod's abbacy in fact originate from Lorsch, and so they can provide little support for Fichtenau's attribution. The text of the oldest manuscript of the Annales regni francorum, discovered at Lorsch and long kept in the Bavarian ducal library, closely resemble the Lorsch annals for the years 789‚Äì93.Petrus Canisius, Antiquae Lectiones, III (Ingolstadt, 1603), 187‚Äì217. This older text tradition of the Annales regni fancorum is often called the Annales laurissenses maiores (greater Lorsch annals), but should not be confused with the Annales laureshamenses. The year entries unique to the Annales laureshamenses may have been written in 803 as a single coherent narrative in annal form as a response to the \\"slant\\" of the Annales regni francorum. The Lorsch annals for the years from 799 to 801 demonstrate its own slant in stressing the legitimacy of Charlemagne's imperial title. The Lorsch annalist argues that the absence of the nomen imperatoris (name of the emperor) in 800 and the femineum imperium (female empire) of the Byzantines at the time justified the Pope in granting the imperial title to Charlemagne, who already held Rome, the imperial capital, and all the imperial cities in Gallia, Germania, and Italia.Collins (2005) examines the different accounts of Charlemagne's imperial coronation in the Annales laureshamenses and the Annales regni francorum on pp. 64‚Äì69. Contents Pope Leo crowning Charlemagne, from the Grandes Chroniques de France (1375‚Äì79). The most complete version of the Annales laureshamenses, from the library at Sankt- Paul, is a universal history that begins with a preface describing its dating scheme, adopted from Orosius' Seven Books of History Against the Pagans and counts 5,199 years from Creation to the Nativity. The anno Domini system is used to date events. The first sixty-five years (703‚Äì67) are described in a prose narrative that is not divided into single-year entries. Beginning with the year 768 the work is divided into chapters (1 to 36) and each entry receives a separate line. The manuscript also contains a calendar from 777 to 835 (folios 5r‚Äì7r) for the dating of Easter, using the unusual 19-year cycles of Theophilus of Alexandria. This calendar suggests the manuscript may have originated before 835. Significantly, the Lorsch annals are the only primary source to contradict the statement of Einhard that Charlemagne was ignorant of Pope Leo III's intention to crown him Emperor on 25 December 800. Rather the Lorsch annals state that the idea was discussed at an assembly held in Rome after Charlemagne's arrival (24 November), probably beginning on 30 November or 1 December. This entry was drawn up only after Charlemagne's return to Francia in 801, since an entry under 799 reports how the conspirators who overthrew Leo in April that year were then in exile. They were only finally exiled early in 801. This entry has, however, generated as much controversy as Einhard's statement of Charlemagne's ignorance. While Ganshof argued that the Annales were more trustworthy than Einhard, others have argued that Charlemagne's policy towards the Byzantine empire both before and after 800 shows little support for the pope's initiative.Even the Annales laureshamenses accord the pope the initiative in the imperial coronation. Cf. Walter Ullmann (1962), The Growth of Papal Government in the Middle Ages: A Study in the Ideological Relation of Clerical to Lay Power (Londong: Methuen), 102‚Äì3 n3. Scholars agreeing with Ullmann are Louis Halphen, S. Heldmann, E. Amann, W. Ohnsorge, and George Ostrogorsky. What Einhard shows Charlemagne objecting to is the Roman imperial title, not necessarily equality with the Byzantine emperors; thus the emphasis the Annales laureshamenses place on justifying the \\"name of the emperor\\".Ullmann, 116. In the Lorsch annals, the year 802 ends with the arrival of the elephant Abul-Abbas at Charlemagne's court. The year 803 is recounted briefly: Charlemagne held Easter at Aachen, held an assembly at Mainz, and did not go on campaign all year. And there the annals end.

Approximately 60,000 people live in the area.  Geography  The Lavant River flows through the valley, having its source on the Zirbitzkogel in Styria and discharging into the Drau near Lavam√ºnd. It is divided into the Upper Lavant Valley (), which lies north of the Twimberger Graben, and the Lower Lavant Valley (), which is further south. The lower, broader valley nestles between the mountains of the Koralpe and Saualpe. The Upper Lavant Valley lies between the Packalpe and the Seetal Alps. The Lavant Valley forms the greater part of the administrative district of Wolfsberg.  Name  The valley derives its name from the Lavant River, which flows through it for from north to south. It has its source in the border region between Styria and Carinthia, on the Styrian mountain of Zirbitzkogel. Near Lavam√ºnd, in the southernmost part of the Lavant Valley, the Lavant empties into the Drau.  Climate  The climate of the Lavant Valley is relatively dry, with around of precipitation annually.Strunz, Gunnar. 2014. K√§rnten: Natur und Kultur zwischen Alpen und W√∂rthersee. Berlin: Trescher Verlag, p. 26. The valley often suffers from temperature inversion during the winter half year, which brings fog and high levels of pollution in the valley bottom. The land at medium elevations around to are thus climatically preferred; they are sunnier and warmer than the terrain of the valley floor.  Agriculture  The growing of maize and the rearing of pigs and chickens are the main forms of agriculture in the valley. In the Lower Lavant Valley and the adjacent Granitz Valley there are many orchards, especially of apples used to make cider and schnapps products. Here there are also several meadow orchards. Another speciality is asparagus. The majority of the Carinthian vineyards, only around , are located in the Lavant Valley. At higher elevations and also in the Upper Lavant Valley, agriculture is dominated by cultivated grassland. Of great importance is the timber industry with its large stands of spruce on the Koralpe and Saualpe.  Art and culture  Well-known artistic personalities such as Christine Lavant, Switbert Lobisser, and Gerhart Ellert have done much to promote the culture of the valley. There are regular special exhibitions in the Benedictine monastery of St. Paul, which enhance the extensive art collections.

Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different color on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000). The other nine groups are depicted as being the Semitic race (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the Caucasian race), the Dravidian race, the Mongolian race (700,000,000), the Malayan race (Correct population given on page 413--64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the American Indian race (10,000,000), the Negro race (140,000,000), the Australian Aborigines, the Papuans, and the Hottentots and Bushmen. Those areas inhabited by mestizos--Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America--are shown on the map as hatched in both the color for Aryans and the color for the American Indian race (population of mestizos in 1944 about 35,000,000). Those areas inhabited by mulattos--Cuba, the Dominican Republic, French Guiana and southeastern Brazil--are shown on the map as hatched in both the color for Aryans and the color for the Negro race. as consisting of native Indo-European Language-speaking peoples of Caucasian ancestry,Durant Will, Our Oriental Heritage (Volume I of The Story of Civilization) New York:1954 Simon and Schuster Page 286 i.e., those ethnic groups that are the native speakers of Indo-European Languages regarded as descended from the original speakers of Proto-Indo European. At the time the book was published, the Aryan race was generally regarded as one of the three major branches of the Caucasian race, along with the Semitic race and the Hamitic race. These sub-categories are now regarded by some as scientific racism. Outline of the content of the book The 4th edition of Meyers Konversationslexikon (Leipzig, 1885-1890) shows the Caucasian race (in pale and in grayish bluish-green) as comprising Aryans, Semites and Hamites. Aryans are further subdivided into European Aryans and Indo-Aryans (the latter corresponding to the group now designated as the Aryans proper or Indo-Iranians). In this massive best-selling two volume work, Joseph Pomeroy Widney, the chancellor of the University of Southern California, describes what he believed was the origin of the \\"Proto-Aryans\\" in Central Asia about 7000 years ago, and how they spread out and formed the great \\"Aryan empires.\\" He included empires which were predominantly Indo- European language-speaking: The Hittite empire, Persian empire, Mauryan empire, Macedonian empire, Roman empire, Gupta empire, Spanish empire, French empire, and British empire, finally resulting in the colonization of North America by the \\"Aryans\\", with the entire process culminating in the manifest destiny of the \\"Aryan Americans\\" of the United States to establish an American Empire.  Ethnic groups traditionally regarded as included in the Aryan race  The Aryan race is historically and traditionally defined as that branch of the Caucasian race that consists of those who are the descendants of the original Proto-Indo-Europeans.Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994‚ÄîMerriam-Webster Page 66 The area primarily inhabited by these people is shown in chartreuse green on the map above, except for those regions colored chartreuse green on the map that are primarily inhabited by people who are native speakers of Indo-European languages but are not caucasian such as areas inhabited primarily by those who are of Black African ancestry--parts of The South in the United States, Haiti, the Caribbean Islands, northeastern Brazil, and Equatorial Guinea; and areas inhabited primarily by mulattos-- Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and French Guiana.Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition Chicago:1944 Rand McNally Map: \\"Races of Mankind\\" Pages 278-279--In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race is shown as one of the ten major races of mankind (the word ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for ‚ÄúIndo-Europeans‚Äù). The area shown on the 1944 map as being inhabited by the Aryan race is coterminous with the area on the map above that is colored chartreuse green, with the exception of the regions noted above in the caption of the Wikipedia map provided on this page for this article. The book also discusses the \\"racial characteristics\\" of the various subgroups of the Aryan race and their constituent ethnic groups. Widney believed that these characteristics were determined by the soil and climate of the original homeland of each subgroup or individual ethnic group. The original 19th century and early 20th century use of the term Aryan (the original meaning of the term in English), as noted above, refers to \\"the early speakers of Proto-Indo European and their descendents\\". Today in academic discourse these human beings would generally be referred to as the Indo- European peoples. These ethnic groups are indicated below: The Eastern branch includes the Indo-Aryans (including the Maldivians) and the Iranian peoples (including Kurds); the Western branch includes the Armenians, Balts, Slavs, Romani, Albanians, Greeks, Romanics, Teutonics, Celts, Anglo-Americans (includes the European-Americans and the Anglo-Canadians), Qu√©b√©cois, North American White Hispanics, White Latin Americans, Anglo-Australians, Anglo-New Zealanders, British diaspora in Africa, and Boers.Widney, Joseph P Race Life of the Aryan Peoples New York: Funk & Wagnalls. 1907 in Two Volumes: Volume One--The Old World Volume Two--The New World ISBN B000859S6O Today, as of 2011, the total population of the Indo-European peoples is approximately 2,405,000,000 people, of which over half, about 1,334,000,000, are those belonging to the Eastern branch of the Indo-European peoples, i.e., the Indo- Iranian peoples; and the rest, about 1,071,000,000, are those belonging to the Western branch of the Indo-European peoples, the European peoples. List of ethnolinguistic groups with populations Introduction to the book Every masterful race of the world‚Äôs history has its epic. It is the tale of the fathers told to the sons. But side by side with the spoken epic is another, unspoken, yet truer and deeper. It is the tale of the race life, not told in words, but lived in deeds done. And the epic lived is always more wonderful than the epic told. The true epic is found, not in the story of the battles or of the deeds of the rulers, but in the race life. In the perspective of time men become less, man grows greater. Race life is broader, deeper, richer than the life of any man, or of any men. The great men of a race are only an evolution of its race force; and the reserve force is greater than its product. They are indices, race marks. The great man is as the mountain peak; for the mountains that loom up above the widespread plain are not the land; they are only the land-marks, marks of the land. Kings are the accident; the people, the law. The Greek colonies, not Ilium and Atreides Agamemnon, are the true epic of Hellas, vastly more marvelous. So of the Aryan folk; not the Vedas, not the Avestas, not the Iliad, or the Nibelungenlied, or Beowulf, but the marvelous tale of what the Aryan man has lived‚Äîhow he has subdued the wild and waste lands‚Äîhow he has made the desert to blossom as the rose‚Äîhow he has built up empire with ax and plow, and has sailed the unknown paths of the seas‚Äîthese are his true race epic. The others are only as the fairy tales which old wives tell to their children. We read between the lines of the written epic to find the truer and greater epic which lies beyond. This book is an attempt to unfold somewhat of the race epic which the Aryan peoples have lived. ---Joseph Pomeroy Widney Los Angeles, January 1907.Widney, Joseph P.

He was published regularly in science fiction \\"pulp\\" magazines. Life and work Vincent was born in Buffalo, New York in 1893. He attended a technical high school, then enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Vincent left RPI without completing his freshman year, in order to marry.\\"Meet the Authors\\", Amazing Stories, December 1938, p.144 He married Ruth Hoff, and they had two children, a son and a daughter. Vincent worked as a mechanical engineer for Westinghouse, specializing in the installation and testing of large electrical apparatus. Later he was employed as a sales engineer, becoming the manager of a local steam division. Vincent‚Äôs writing career began after he began reading Hugo Gernsback‚Äôs pioneering science fiction magazine Amazing Stories. Vincent‚Äôs first published story, ‚ÄúThe Golden Girl of Munan‚Äù, appeared in the June 1928 issue of the magazine. During the next fourteen years, Vincent published more than seventy science fiction stories. Although most of his work appeared in the early science fiction magazines, he published twice in the general fiction pulp magazine Argosy. Although he ceased publishing during the early 1940s, Vincent remained involved with science fiction. After relocating to Los Angeles, Vincent joined the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society and the Count Dracula Society, as well as attending local science fiction conventions. Vincent resumed writing late in life, publishing the novel The Doomsday Planet in 1966 and the story ‚ÄúInvader‚Äù in the September 1967 issue of If.

Biography  Born 16 October 1834, Clifton, Nottinghamshire, England; Wootton joined the All England Eleven in 1860 but did not play his first first-class match until the following season, when with five for 25 against Surrey at Trent Bridge,Nottinghamshire v Surrey in 1861 he established himself as a member of the county side and was to remain a regular for a decade. However, it was when Wootton joined the ground staff at Lord's the following season that he became famous. A round-arm fast-medium left hand bowler, who skilfully varied his speed off a run of merely two paces,Lubbock, Alfred (1909) ‚ÄúCricket in the sixties and at the present day: Not an easy comparison‚Äù in John Wisden's Cricketers‚Äô Almanac; Forty-Sixth Edition Wootton was exactly suited to the rough Lord's wickets of the 1860s.\\"Obituary ‚Äì George Wootton\\", Wisden Almanack On these wickets, where no heavy roller was ever usedSee \\"Dates in Cricket History\\", Wisden Almanack, to see when pitches were first rolled and the grass was cut by a scythe that left rough tufts on the surface, there were typically stones formed from the drying of the clayey soilsRae, Simon (1999) W. G. Grace: A Life, p. 54, Faber, London and balls which hit these stones could either become dead shooters or fly right over a batsman's and wicket-keeper's head.Green, Benny (1979) Wisden Anthology 1864‚Äì1900 p. 604, Queen Anne Press, London Wootton's low delivery allowed him to bowl, according to contemporaries, even more shooters than such terrifying bowlers as Jackson, Tarrant and George Freeman. It was normal for batsmen facing Wootton at Lord's to receive two shooters in each four-ball over and in tandem with veteran Jimmy Grundy, Wootton was almost unplayable. In his first Lord's game for the MCC Wootton took fourteen for 46 and bowling eight men in his first inningsMarylebone Cricket Club v Sussex in 1862 and on the strength of this performance he played one game in the Canterbury Week for \\"England\\" against Kent. The following year Wootton took eighty-seven wickets for 9.74 and again was deadly against Sussex,Marylebone Cricket Club v Sussex in 1863 but it was already noted that Wootton was not a formidable bowler on other southern grounds where the light roller then in use was adequate for true bounce. At Hove, Wootton did achieve the unusual feat of adding 106 for the tenth wicket with Ralph Forster ‚Äì almost the first time a century was added for the last wicket in a first-class match. In 1864, the difference in his and Grundy's deadliness between Lord's and other grounds was graphically seen when at Lord's the pair bowled out Oxford University for 44Marylebone Cricket Club v Oxford University in 1864 and the newly formed Middlesex club for a record-low 20Marylebone Cricket Club v Middlesex in 1864 ‚Äì but were hit by the same two teams for 439 at OxfordOxford University v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1864 and 411 at the soon-to-be-demolished Cattle Market Ground.Middlesex v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1864 1865 saw no advance on his previous three years despite taking ten wickets in an innings against a very weak Yorkshire eleven, but as Grundy gradually declined with age Wootton came to take on more responsibility for the Marylebone Club and even for Nottinghamshire, where he was always second fiddle to Grundy, Cris Tinley or Jem Shaw. He also established himself as a regular for the Players and other representative elevens, though he did little apart from six for 24 on a Kennington Oval pitch spoiled by rain where the Gentlemen came back and won well.Gentlemen v Players in 1866 1867 was Wootton's most successful season ever with 142 wickets in just nineteen games; though he again failed against the Gentlemen where Alfred Lubbock and E.M. Grace made large scores, he was more terrifying than ever elsewhere until August. The exceptionally hot and dry summer of 1868, however, saw him lose a little of his deadliness with thirty-six fewer wickets, but Wootton recovered this ground for one last time in 1869 before, at the beginning of the 1870s, losing his skill for good just before the heavy roller and motor mower eliminated the shooters that made him so feared. Wootton took ninety wickets in 1870, but was so ineffective after May in 1871 with the first extensive use of heavy rollers, as to drop out of first-class cricket at the end of July with a mere ten wickets in eight games. A few deadly games in 1872 suggested he was still capable of terrorising batsmen at Lord's, but around this time Wootton showed an interest in giving up cricket for a career as a farmer, which he did following a benefit in 1873. Wootton stood as a first-class umpire from 1871 to 1883. In 1921, his eighty-seventh year, he watched the first Test match ever played at Trent Bridge.

In 2009, the State Senate was controlled by Democrats with a narrow 32‚Äì30 majority. On June 8, 2009, a coalition of all 30 Senate Republicans and two Democrats, Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada Jr., voted to replace Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with then-Senate Republican Leader Dean Skelos. The coalition appeared to have gained control of the Senate in a move that was described as a political coup. However, on June 15, Monserrate left the coalition and returned to the Democrats' side. The result was a 31‚Äì31 tie in the Senate. Upon the March 17, 2008 resignation of Gov. Eliot Spitzer following a sex scandal, then-Lieutenant Governor David Paterson had been sworn in as Governor of New York; this left the position of Lieutenant Governor vacant. The absence of a Lieutenant Governor (whose duties include serving as President of the Senate) left no apparent way to break the 31‚Äì31 deadlock; therefore, the Senate was unable to conduct business. Governor Paterson attempted to pressure the Senate into action by withholding their salaries and convening mandatory special Senate sessions, but his efforts did not meet with success. On July 8, Governor Paterson appointed Richard Ravitch as Lieutenant Governor in an effort to break the Senate deadlock. However, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo argued that the appointment was illegal. The next day, Espada announced that he was returning to the Democrats, giving them a 32‚Äì30 majority once more and effectively ending the crisis; following this move, Espada was given the title of Senate Majority Leader, while Smith remained Temporary President of the Senate. The appointment of Ravitch as Lieutenant Governor was eventually upheld by the New York Court of Appeals. Background and leadup The State Senate had been controlled by Republicans since 1965, but Democrats were able to win a majority in the 2008 elections. The change was helped by upstate Republican billionaire Tom Golisano, who had donated $5 million to the Democrats' campaigns. However, dissatisfaction with the job that Majority Leader Malcolm Smith was doing was growing with his fellow Democrats, as well as with Golisano. Golisano, with the aid of his political adviser Steve Pigeon, set up a series of private meetings between Republican senators Dean Skelos, Tom Libous, and George D. Maziarz, and after Pigeon convinced him, Democratic senator Pedro Espada Jr. The first meeting took place at a club in Albany, followed by one at Golisano's house in Rochester, followed by a series at Espada's house in Albany. Espada said that Senator Monserrate was the only one among his fellow Democrats that knew of the meetings. Roger Stone, Republican strategist and political infighter may have been involved in the discussions, and according to Pigeon, knew about the plan in advance. Golisano, who recently moved to Florida, did not take part in the meetings at Espada's house, but was kept informed by Pigeon. On June 4, Pigeon told Golisano that the deal \\"was real solid,\\" and on June 8, Golisano was in Albany to watch the events unfold from the Senate chamber balcony. June 8 Senate coup During the Senate session on June 8, Republican Senator Thomas Libous proposed a resolution, similar to a motion of no confidence, that would allow for the election of a new leader of the Senate. The entire 32-senator coalition voted for the resolution. After the resolution was passed, but before the vote was recognized by officiating officer, Senator Neil Breslin, Senator Jeffrey Klein moved for adjournment. Libous demanded that his resolution be recognized, but instead Breslin quickly granted Klein's motion for adjournment. Republicans objected, claiming a majority of the Senate did not vote to adjourn. After Breslin declared the meeting adjourned, all but four Democratic senators walked out of the Senate chamber. The Democrats who stayed were Espada and Monserrate, who had voted for the resolution, and Carl Kruger and Ruben Diaz, who abstained from all voting during the course of events but stayed to show their support. After the 28 Democratic senators walked out of the Senate chamber, Secretary of the Senate Angelo Aponte turned off the lights in the Senate chamber and stopped the TV broadcast of the Senate session. Nevertheless, the remaining senators proceeded to vote for new leadership, removing Democratic Senator Malcolm Smith from his position as Majority Leader and Temporary President of the Senate, and replacing him with two people: Republican Minority Leader Dean Skelos as Majority Leader, and Pedro Espada as Temporary President.The position is named \\"temporary\\" because the Lieutenant Governor is the ex officio President of the State Senate, while the Temporary President is chosen by the senators. It is common, especially in the newsmedia, for the terms \\"temporary president\\", \\"president pro tempore\\", or \\"Senate president\\" to be used synonymously. In addition, the legal terminology has changed as the New York Constitution was changed. For more, see Majority Leader of the New York State Senate. Historically, the majority leadership and the temporary presidency of the Senate were held by the same person. However, in the new arrangement, Espada was to be the Temporary President of the Senate, while Skelos would become Majority Leader. After the election of the new leadership, the coalition enacted reform rules including a six-year term limit for the majority leader, steps to equalize budget differences between opposing parties, as well as rules about the distribution of pork barrel projects. Despite voting for the change in leadership, Espada and Monserrate stated that they were still Democrats, and that there was still a 32‚Äì30 Democratic majority in the Senate. Immediate reaction The Democrats claimed that the change was illegal, and that therefore Malcolm Smith was still the Majority Leader and Temporary President. According to Smith and other Democrats, Senator Neil Breslin had accepted a motion to adjourn, and therefore ended the session before the Republicans voted to change leadership. Republican Senator Libous argues that since his original motion was on the floor, the session could not have been adjourned. Furthermore, like all motions, motions for adjournment require a vote, which never took place before Breslin adjourned the session. Malcolm Smith also claimed that the attempted power shift was not legal, even if the resolution did pass. He issued a statement saying that he \\"was elected to a two year term pursuant to a resolution passed by a majority of Senators in January 2009\\", and that \\"the purported coup was an unlawful violation of New York State law and the Senate rules\\" which he does not accept. However, there was precedent for changing the majority leader midterm, as Ralph J. Marino was ousted during the Thanksgiving holiday in 1994. Governor David Paterson criticized the initial motion by Senator Libous' as \\"despicable\\" and \\"an outrage\\" due to the issues that are still on the table in the remainder of the legislative session. Former Governor Eliot Spitzer has been more supportive of the moves, saying: \\"The use of that power by two Democratic senators, though perhaps for questionable purposes, is emboldening others to use their leverage to bargain for worthwhile causes.\\" Events after initial change =Legal actions= On June 10, Malcolm Smith said he was seeking a temporary court order to prevent the Republicans from taking power. Later in the day, Justice Karen Peters, a judge in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, granted Senator Smith's request for a temporary restraining order against Espada. The restraining order prevented Espada from exercising the power granted to the temporary president of the Senate under Article IV, ¬ß6, of the New York Constitution, which include the elevation of Senate president to acting governor when the governor is out of state or incapacitated. The order was valid until the outcome of a Supreme Court hearing, which was scheduled for the next day. The ruling put Sheldon Silver, Speaker of the New York State Assembly, temporarily next-in-line of succession to the governor's office. This restraining order was vacated by Justice Thomas J. McNamara on June 16. McNamara refused to intervene in the dispute, saying that \\"a judicially imposed resolution would be an improvident intrusion into the internal workings of a co-equal branch of government\\", and he urged the senators to solve the problem by negotiation. Separately from Senator Smith's request, Senator Neil Breslin attempted to file an injunction on June 11. The injunction was denied by New York Supreme Court Justice George Ceresia. On June 24, Republican senators John Flanagan and George Winner filed a petition with Justice McNamara, requesting that Aponte be forced to recognize the authority of Skelos and Espada. Aponte had instructed the chamber's stenographer, journal clerk, and sergeants-at-arms to ignore any orders from the Republican leaders. On June 26, McNamara adjourned the case to allow the Senators more time for discussion. =Initial attempts to hold session= On June 9, the day following the attempted power shift, Aponte denied Espada the keys to the Senate chamber, at which point Espada accused Aponte of abusing his power and asked for his resignation. Aponte refused, responding \\"I was appointed legislatively for a two year term and I intend to serve out my two year term.\\" The following day, June 10, Espada acquired the keys, but not from Aponte or any of the Senate Democrats. On June 11, minutes after Neil Breslin's requested injunction was denied, the Republican-led coalition held a brief session, but they were unable to conduct business because the Democratic conference had locked away the bills, and also had withheld the stenographer, who is required for official business. This proved immaterial, as the coalition would not have had the required votes necessary to pass a bill. Hiram Monserrate voted \\"present\\", and then left the session, leaving 31 senators in the session, one shy of the 32 votes needed to pass a bill. Monserrate said that he would not vote on anything until more Democrats joined the Senate session, and instead wanted to create a compromise that included the Democrats who were boycotting the session. Monserrate's decision to not vote on any issues led to rumors that he might flip back to the Democrats' side. The tie Hiram Monserrate announces he is leaving the coalition and returning to the Democrats as Malcolm Smith looks on. =Monserrate flips= Senate Republicans were confident that Monserrate would stay on their side. However, on June 12, Monserrate was praising Democratic Senator John Sampson, who was the front-runner to replace Senator Smith as the Democratic leader. On June 15, in an apparent effort to woo Monserrate, Democrats voted Senator John Sampson as their de facto leader. The move proved successful for the Democrats, as later that day Senator Monserrate declared he would once again caucus with the Democrats. =No tiebreaker= Monserrate's decision to return to the Democrats meant that the Senate was evenly divided 31‚Äì31, without a clear way to break the tie. In the case of a tie in the Senate, a casting vote, also called a tie-breaking vote, is issued by the Lieutenant Governor.For more information about legislative crises in New York, see Theophilus C. Callicot and the tied Assembly of 1863; the seven weeks lasting deadlock of the 1881 United States Senate special elections in New York; John C. Jacobs and the Senate leadership crisis of 1882; Daniel D. Frisbie and the U.S. Senatorial election crisis in 1911; and Joseph Zaretzki and the Senate leadership crisis of 1965. The lieutenant governorship, however, had been vacant since David Paterson ascended to the governor's office upon the resignation of former Governor Eliot Spitzer. According to the State Constitution, if the Lieutenant Governor's office is vacant, the Temporary President of the Senate is to perform all of his duties, which includes making the casting vote. However, since Senators Smith and Espada both claimed to be Senate president, the tie could not be clearly broken. Special elections for lieutenant governor were forbidden by an amendment to the State Constitution after the death of Thomas W. Wallace and subsequent election of Joe R. Hanley in 1943, and according to traditional interpretation of the statute, there is no provision in state law that allows the governor and legislature to appoint a replacement, as there is with other statewide positions.\\"No election of a lieutenant-governor shall be had in any event except at the time of electing a governor.\\" see New York Constitution , Art. 4, ¬ß 6 On June 17, Espada asserted that because he was Senate president, he would effectively get to vote twice: once as a Senator, and again as Temporary President, who \\"[performs] all the duties of lieutenant governor\\", which includes breaking ties in the Senate. Pedro Espada and Dean Skelos address the media following the June 23 Special Senate session. =Legislative deadlock= On June 30, the Democrats took advantage of Republican State Senator Frank Padavan's brief walk through the Senate chamber to claim a quorum, but Governor Paterson said he did not believe Padavan's merely walking into the chamber created a quorum and so he would not sign any of the bills passed during that alleged quorum. They passed \\"non-controversial\\" bills, including a motel tax, 911 service fees, and a bond authorization for Nassau. On July 7, Monserrate, accompanied by fellow Democratic Senator Ruben Diaz, walked out on the Democrats; the two stated that they were not abandoning the Democratic Conference, but that the power struggle must end. Governor Paterson's actions Governor David Paterson =Staying in-state= Shortly following the attempted change in Senate leadership, Governor David Paterson announced that he would avoid out-of-state travel, saying \\"the best thing for me to do is to stay here.\\" The New York Constitution states that whenever the governor is out of state, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor. Since there was no clear line of succession, it was unclear who would have become acting governor, which is a situation the Governor attempted to avoid. Paterson did not leave the state from June 8 until the resolution of the crisis, which required him to skip several out-of- state events. =Calling special Senate sessions= On June 21, Governor Paterson announced that he would convene a special session on June 23 ‚Äì setting \\"routine\\" but \\"time-sensitive\\" bills such as mayoral control over New York City schools, sales tax, and same-sex marriage bills on the agenda. He also stated that he would convene a special session every day, including weekends and July 4, until the senators finished their job. On June 23, all senators met in the Senate chamber but each caucus held a separate session, ignoring the other.This erratic behavior has a historic precedent: in 1853, at the Democratic state convention two Chairmen were elected by the opposing Hard and Soft factions which then sat side by side and presided over the convention ignoring each other amid much confusion. Governor Paterson then called daily extraordinary sessions of the State Senate, but each caucus met separately and adjourned without doing any business for lack of quorum. On request of Governor Paterson, Justice Joseph C. Teresi ordered the State Senators on June 29 to convene together the next day. The Republicans appealed. =Withholding Senators' pay and grants= On June 24, Governor Paterson asked that New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli withhold the paychecks and per diems of the Senators retroactively from June 8, when Senate crisis initially started. Senator Kevin Parker rejected the idea, saying that Governor Paterson \\"doesn't have any constitutional or legal authority to dock our pay.\\" DiNapoli initially said that he would look into the legality of the request. On July 2, DiNapoli agreed to withhold the Senators' pay, even though no court ruled that he had the authority to do so. Although the Senators' pay was being withheld, it could not be kept permanently, as the Constitution restricts changing the legislature's pay during session; it was disbursed after the crisis was resolved. Paterson also declared that he would withhold $85 million in pork barrel grants. These grants were given to the senators individually to be spent on pet projects in the Senators' districts. However, the impact was negligible because no such projects had been approved in 2009. Appointment of a Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch was appointed Lieutenant Governor by Governor Paterson. =The Governor's speech= On July 8, at 5:01 pm, Governor Paterson appointed former MTA chairman Richard Ravitch as Lieutenant Governor of New York, although, despite numerous vacancies, no lieutenant governor had ever been appointed in New York history.Vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office have been filled by special elections in 1811, 1847 and 1943, or were filled at the next gubernatorial election. Otherwise, the temporary presidents of the State Senate have acted as lieutenant governors under the provisions of all State Constitutions since 1777. However, Paterson believed that he had the authority to fill the vacancy due to provisions of the New York State Public Officers Law. =Legality of the appointment= The New York Constitution prohibits electing a lieutenant governor \\"except at the time of electing a governor,\\" and provides that the \\"temporary president of the senate shall perform all the duties of lieutenant governor\\" in the absence of a lieutenant governor, and that the Speaker of the State Assembly is then next-in-line of succession to the governor's office in case of a vacancy of the temporary presidency of the Senate.see New York Constitution , Art. 4, ¬ß 6 However, State Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris formed an interpretation of the Public Officers Laws that would allow Paterson to fill the vacancy by appointment. This interpretation was supported by an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. It is also supported by good government groups Citizens Union and Common Cause, both of which urged Paterson to make an appointment. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo held that Paterson's interpretation was unconstitutional, and that the appointment was not valid. Senator Espada announced he would sue to prevent the appointment, and said that this appointment had ruined Paterson's reputation as an impartial mediator of the situation. Senator Skelos also expressed his concern with the appointment, stating that \\"it's illegal, it's unconstitutional\\", and believed that it would create more chaos and government gridlock. =Ravitch's swearing-in and legal battle= Ravitch was initially expected to be sworn in July 9, the day after his appointment, at 11:30 am. However, Paterson's administration officials rushed to swear in Ravitch quickly, ahead of the expected legal battles. He was sworn in at approximately 8 pm, just 3 hours after his appointment, and the necessary paperwork was shortly filed with the Secretary of State's office. Republicans attempted to block Ravitch from taking the oath of office by seeking a temporary restraining order. They successfully acquired one shortly after 11 pm, signed by State Supreme Court Justice Ute W. Lally. The Republicans initially thought that this was early enough to prevent Ravitch from entering office, but they later learned that he had already been sworn in. The restraining order prevented Ravitch from taking any actions as Lt. Governor. However, it was vacated the next day, and a hearing to rule on the legality of the appointment was scheduled for the following day, Friday, July 10. At the hearing in the State Supreme Court in Mineola, the judge adjourned matters until July 15. On July 15, lawyers for Governor Patterson and Senators Skelos and Espada presented their arguments. On July 21, New York Supreme Court Justice William R. LaMarca said that the plaintiffs ‚Äúhave established a likelihood of success on the merits for their claim that neither the Constitution nor legislative enactment authorized the governor to make the appointment,\\" and issued a preliminary injunction which barred Ravitch from carrying out the duties of the office. A new hearing was scheduled for August 25, but lawyers for Governor Paterson filed an appeal in the Appellate Division. The preliminary injunction was stayed by Appellate Division Justice L. Priscilla Hall, who had been appointed to the Appellate Division by Paterson in March 2009. On July 30, a four-judge panel of the Second Department of the Appellate Division ruled that Ravitch \\"can continue serving as lieutenant governor pending a legal challenge over his appointment ‚Äì but he cannot preside over the State Senate.\\" A hearing was held on August 18 before the Appellate Division's Second Dept. in Brooklyn, at which lawyers for both sides presented oral arguments. David Lewis, attorney for Dean Skelos and the Republican Senate caucus, likened the appointment of Ravitch to the Roman Emperor Caligula's naming of his horse to public office. Justice Thomas A. Dickerson said that \\"there is to be no one who is appointed to take this office.\\" Justice Steven W. Fisher said he expected the Court to rule as soon as possible, referring the case directly to the New York Court of Appeals. On August 20, the Appellate Division rejected the appointment, saying that \\"the Governor‚Äôs purported appointment of Mr. Ravitch was unlawful because no provision of the Constitution or of any statute provides for the filling of a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor other than by election.\\" However, on September 22, 2009 the New York Court of Appeals ruled 4‚Äì3 that the appointment of Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch by Governor David Paterson was constitutional. Democrats retake Senate majority On July 9, Espada announced that he would return to the Democratic conference, which effectively ended the Senate deadlock as Democrats once again had a 32‚Äì30 majority. Espada claimed to have a \\"handshake agreement\\" with Democratic leader Senator John L. Sampson which would make Espada Senate president for the rest of 2009. Later on the same day, Espada officially became Senate Majority Leader, while Malcolm Smith remained Temporary President of the Senate. Sampson was said to be in line to take over for Smith as Temporary President at an undetermined future date; however, Smith retained hold of the Senate presidency until the end of the term, when control of the chamber passed to the Republicans following the November 2010 elections.Johnson, Michael (November 29, 2010). Sampson elected leader . YNN. Retrieved November 29, 2010. Later on July 9, the Senate passed 135 bills in a session that lasted until 2:00 the following morning. Paterson estimated that the crisis cost the state $125‚Äì$150 million in routine taxes that were not collected.

They are globose when emergent and then become a broad convex as they mature, with the centre of the cap slightly depressed. The caps are often sticky and appear slimy looking, particularly in moist weather. The length of the stipe typically ranges from 1 to 2 cm long and 0.1 to 0.2 cm thick. It is white, smooth and the base of the stipe is attached to the wood substrate by a flat white disk, similar to Mycena austrororida, which, unlike M. interrupta is attached to the wood substrate by a mass of clumped fine hairs. The gills are white, adnexed, with blue margins. The spores are white, smooth, ellipsoid and have dimensions of 7-10√ó4-6 ¬µm.

Day before D-Day After work in advertising, Robbins took over the daily strip Scorchy Smith from Noel Sickles in 1939 with a Sunday page added in 1940. King Features then asked Robbins to do Secret Agent X-9, but Robbins instead chose to devise an aviation comic for the syndicate, and Johnny Hazard was launched on Monday, June 5, 1944, one day before D-Day. While working on the strip during the 1940s, Robbins contributed illustrations to Life, Look, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines. Robbins stopped drawing Johnny Hazard in 1977 and retired to Mexico in order to devote himself to painting full-time.Manley, Mike. Draw! \\"What We Can Learn from Frank Robbins\\", April 4, 2005. Characters and story The strip followed the globe-trotting adventures of aviator Johnny Hazard, initially as a member of the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, later as a Cold War secret agent. Comics historian Don Markstein described the transition: :As the story opened, Johnny, like most American men of his generation, was fighting World War II. But his gig with the Army Air Corps didn't last long, as D-Day came when the strip was only a day old. But the only effect civilian life had on him was to enlarge the scope of his adventures‚Äîas a freelance pilot, Johnny ranged throughout the entire world. (An early focus, tho, was China, putting him head-to-head with the rival Chicago Tribune Syndicate's Terry and the Pirates.) Johnny dealt with spies, beautiful women, smugglers, gorgeous dames, sci-fi style menaces, fabulous chicks and all the other kinds of folks a two- fisted adventurer of his calibre would be expected to deal with. As he did, unlike many fictional two-fisted adventurers, he matured‚Äînot as quickly as real people, but after a third of a century or so, he was quite gray at the temples. And a third of a century was as long as the strip ran. It was popular enough at first, and ran far longer than most post-war adventure strips, but the times were against it. Newspaper editors were more interested in daily gags than continuous stories, and Johnny Hazard succumbed to the trend in 1977.Johnny Hazard at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 21, 2016. International Distribution Johnny Hazard was reprinted in the British comic Rocket during the 1950s.

In January 1930, Kurchevsky was appointed chief designer at the Experimental Design Bureau #1 of the Chief Directorate of Artillery (–û–ø—ã—Ç–Ω–æ-–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ –±—é—Ä–æ - 1 –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ê—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è, –û–ö–ë-1 –ì–ê–£, Ap√≠tna-Konstrukt√≥rskoye Bureau-1 Gl√°vnava Artillyer√≠skava Upravly√©nniya, OKB-1-GAY).

Leonid Kurchevsky and his team designed a score of recoilless guns (–¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–æ—Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –ø—É—à–∫–∞, –îP–ü, din√°moreakt√≠vnaya p√∫shka, DRP) with calibers ranging from 37mm to 420mm, including the so-called 76mm battalion gun (–±–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ø—É—à–∫–∞, –ë–ü–ö, bataly√≥nnaya pushka, BLK), aircraft recoilless gun (–∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ø—É—à–∫–∞, –ê–ü–ö, aviatsiy√≥nnaya pushka, APK), etc. The 76.2 mm APK was fitted to the Grigorovich I-Z fighter. In his experiments with recoilless guns, Leonid Kurchevsky strived to cover a wide range of artillery weapons. Besides their work on field artillery, his team also mounted DRPs on a Grigorovich I-Z fighter armed with 2x APK recoilless guns (1935), mounted a 305mm howitzer on an automobile, a 305mm recoilless gun on a destroyer, a 152mm recoilless gun on a torpedo boat, etc. Kurchevsky enjoyed the support of Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Sergo Ordzhonikidze in promoting his projects. Among his other inventions were a prototype of a grenade launcher, an all-terrain motor boat for polar conditions, a three-axis all-terrain wheeled and tracked vehicle, a winged torpedo, and a special hydroplane. Most of Kurchevsky‚Äôs experimental guns had too many irreparable defects and their technical specifications did not correspond to those declared. In 1937, Kurchevsky was arrested, charged with designing poor weapons systems at the Tukhachevsky Case, and sentenced to death on November 25, 1937. The exact date of his execution is still uncertain: various sources claim it to be either November 26, 1937 or January 12, 1939. In the late 1930s, Kurchevsky‚Äôs recoilless guns were removed from operational status and almost all were destroyed. His gun systems were never used in the Great Patriotic War and all work on recoilless artillery in the USSR was stalled for a long time to come. Leonid Kurchevsky was rehabilitated posthumously in 1956.

Mitton was also a cricketer for Somerset in 1920. Football career Mitton was born in Todmorden, West Yorkshire and was first recorded as playing football as a youth with Portsmouth Rovers of the Lancashire Combination, before spells with Padiham and Brierfield. He joined Burnley of the Football League First Division as a trainee in 1914 but failed to break into the first team before the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, he made guest appearances for Bury, before joining Exeter City, then in the Southern League in June 1919. He remained with Exeter City for the early part of their inaugural season in the Football League Third Division before being signed by First Division club Sunderland in October 1920. He was immediately drafted into the first team, making his debut at right-half as replacement for Robert Coverdale in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Bradford City on 23 October 1920. He retained his place for the rest of the season, at the end of which Sunderland finished twelfth in the table. At the start of the 1921‚Äì22 season, Mitton lost his place to Joe Kasher before being recalled to the side as a centre-forward in October, replacing Paul Stannard. Mitton continued at centre-forward until mid-January when Harry Brown took over, with Mitton replacing Kasher at centre-half. During his time up front, Mitton had a run of four matches in December 1921 when he scored seven goals, including a hat-trick in a 5‚Äì0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Christmas Eve. Mitton remained at Roker Park for two more seasons, with his final first team appearance coming in November 1923, before dropping down to the Second Division in May 1924 when he joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. At Molineux, Mitton was a virtual ever-present for three seasons, becoming team captain before a transfer to Southampton in June 1927. Mitton joined the \\"Saints\\" for a fee of ¬£150 and was used as cover for the three half-back positions. His only significant run in the first team came in September/October 1927, when he replaced Stan Woodhouse at left-back for six matches. After two further appearances late in the season, Mitton retired in the summer of 1928. Cricket career Whilst at Exeter, Mitton joined Somerset County Cricket Club, for whom he made two first-class appearances in the summer of 1920, against Cambridge University and Oxford University. In the two matches, he scored a total of 15 runs and took one wicket.

Rebelski was recommended by a friend of Rob Gretton to play as a session musician for Doves, but soon became the band's touring keyboard player. In addition to playing with Doves on tour, Rebelski has also played on all of the band's albums. Rebelski produced and released his first single \\"Scarecrow,\\" which was sold at Doves' shows in late winter 2002, and his debut album Thanks for Your Thoughts arrived in March 2003. Rebelski's debut solo live performance was as support for Doves at the band's 27 March gig at the Royal Albert Hall, a benefit for the Teenage Cancer trust. Following a recommendation from Damon Gough, Rebelski signed to Twisted Nerve Records, and recorded his second solo album Stickers on Keys. The album was released in November 2004 to warm critical reception. Rebelski parted ways with Twisted Nerve as his third studio album was ready for release in summer 2007.

First published in 1957,Amazon.com page on The Secret Lore of Magic it includes several major source-books of magical arts, translated from French, Latin, Hebrew and other tongues, annotated and fully illustrated with numerous diagrams, signs and characters. Together with Oriental Magic, which appeared in the preceding year, it provided an important literary-anthropological survey of magical literature and is a comprehensive reference for psychologists, ethnologists and others interested in the rise and development of human beliefs. In addition to the inherent worth of their content, The Secret Lore of Magic and Oriental Magic can also be seen as a ground-breaking operation by this author, before publishing over the ensuing years his many volumes of Sufi thought, ideas, and materials. Content Black magic and maleficium or sorcery have been practised through the ages with the aid of certain jealously guarded writings, such as the Black Books of the Magicians. The Secret Lore of Magic includes the entire text of the four books of the Secrets of Albertus Magnus, the Book of the Spirits, the Almadel, the Book of Power, the Clavicle and the Testament, the Grimoire of Honorius the Great, and the processes of the Black Pact as given by the True Grimoire and the Great Grimoire. Copies of these Grimoires (the \\"grammars\\" of sorcery) were extremely rare, and although occult works based on parts of grimoires were continuing to appear, the actual sources had never before been made available for study and comparison. =Views= Shah points out that all magic essentially outside religious rituals, had been viewed by clerics as nothing less than the Black Art. That attitude shifted during the centuries of research in Arabian Spain, as a result of which magic became officially understood as divided into the twin categories of black and white. The Secret Lore of Magic reflects this division. Its pages contain both the most sublime, complex and important rituals and methods of white magic, (The Key of Solomon), and also what was considered to be the most diabolical work on black magic ever written (The Grimoire of Honorius the Great). Although the major part of The Secret Lore consists of primary sources, the author‚Äôs own informed commentary runs through it, often setting symbols, rituals and practices in a clearer light or wider context. Shah also states that the methods of making spells, charms and talismans, together with the rituals of raising spirits through the Magical Circle, all of which are contained in this work, between them comprise the whole gamut of supernatural power. Commentary Commenting on these works, Shah emphasised that neither had relevance to, nor were written for, contemporary devotees of witchcraft and magic. > For too long people believed that there were secret books, hidden places, > and amazing things. They held onto this information as something to frighten > themselves with. So the first purpose was information. This is the magic of > East and West. That's all. There is no more.

Or the exposed rocky cliffs on the Mount Royal Range in New South Wales, where it is subject to high winds and snow. The habitat is many types of rainforests from sea level to 1200 metres, sometimes also seen in sclerophyll forests.  Description  Usually around two metres tall, sometimes larger. Leaves in whorls, narrow lanceolate to broad lanceolate in shape, 1 to 6 cm long. Thick, leathery and glossy with a pointed tip. Leaves usually not toothed, lateral veins obvious. The leaf stem is between 1 and 4 mm long. Fragrant white flowers form in spring and summer, in terminal heads of 3 to 5 flowers. The fruit is orange to red in colour, 8 to 11 mm in diameter.

The Gwen Verdon recording of \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\" was utilized as the theme song for the pilot episode of the CBS-TV sitcom The Nanny although an original song entitled \\"The Nanny Named Fran\\" served as the theme song for the series' subsequent episodes: airings of The Nanny's pilot episode in syndication utilize \\"The Nanny Named Fran\\" as that episode's theme song rather than \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\". The original cast recording for the 1967 West End production of Sweet Charity features \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\" performed by Juliet Prowse. Bonnie Langford, who headlined the 1998 West End revival of Sweet Charity, included \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\" in a medley of songs from Sweet Charity featured on her 1999 album Now. A 1995 studio recording of the score of Sweet Charity features Jacqueline Dankworth performing \\"If My Friends Could See Me Now\\".

As artist his own work occupies a characteristic place, but as editor also his role was extremely important in bringing together some of the outstanding talents of that distinctive period in French art and providing the commissions upon which the development of their work in a formal context occurred.  Early career  Born in Lille, Chimot studied under Jean-Baptiste Levert and Alexis Mossa at the √âcole des Arts d√©coratifs in Nice, and then under Pharaon de Winter at the Beaux-Arts, Lille. The course of his early career is unclear. He seems to have first exhibited in 1912, rather late at the age of 32, and perilously close to the outbreak of World War I, which was to cause a four-year hiatus in his career, so that Chimot was 39 by the time he really made his mark on the Paris art world. It seems possible that Chimot's late start as an artist was because he initially trained as an architect - the only evidence for this is an item on the internet from Fodor's guides, which credits Chimot with the design in 1903 of the Villa Lysis in Capri, for the dissolute Baron Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd- Fersen. He went to Paris at the start of the 20th century and tried various occupations to gain a living, while continuing to draw at night.J.-L. Bernard, Bibliographie de Chimot. It was at this time that he bought an etching press and taught himself printmaking, in his rare free time. In the years before the War Chimot had an atelier in Montmartre, haunted by \\"jeunes et jolies femmes\\" who served as his models. His first exhibition of drawings, etchings, and monotypes was in 1912; this was a success, and earned him a commission to illustrate Ren√© Baudu‚Äôs text Les Apr√®s-midi de Montmartre with etchings of what Andr√© Warnod termed his \\"petites filles perdues\\" (little lost girls). Then came the long interruption of the First World War, during which Chimot was mobilized for nearly five years.  A fresh start  After the war, Chimot rented Renoir‚Äôs studio in the Boulevard de Rochechouart. He already had the etchings for Les Apr√®s-midi de Montmartre. These were published in 1919, followed by La Mont√©e aux enfers and Les Soirs d‚Äôopium by Maurice Magre, Le Fou by Aurele Partorni, L‚ÄôEnfer by Henri Barbusse, La Petite Jeanne p√¢le by Jean de Tinan, and Mouki le Delaisse by Andr√© Cuel, all illustrated with original etchings between 1920 and 1922. In 1921 Chimot also founded a magazine, La Roseraie: Revue des Arts et des Lettres, published by the printer and publisher La Roseraie under Chimot‚Äôs artistic direction. This however ceased production after a single issue. = Devambez = This led to the breakthrough in Chimot's career by which he became artistic director of Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez. Between 1923 and 1931, from his atelier in the rue Amp√®re, he oversaw the production of a wonderful array of books illustrated by such artists as Pierre Brissaud, Edgar Chahine, Alm√©ry Lobel-Riche, and Tsuguharu Foujita. He reserved some choice texts for himself, including Les Chansons de Bilitis by Pierre Lou√øs (1925), Les Belles de nuit by Magre (1927), and Parall√®lement by Paul Verlaine (1931). The crucial decade of his career was that between the end of World War I and the Wall Street Crash. It was during this time of frivolity and excess that √âdouard Chimot created the haunting and compelling images by which his name will endure. Not only was he editing an important list for Devambez, but he remained at the same time as director of √âditions de La Roseraie, while also pursuing his own artistic career. In the 1920s, √âdouard Chimot also made at least two films, L‚ÄôOrni√®re (1924, also known as Micheline Horn and as Sur le Chemin de Vrai) and Survivre (date unknown). During the glittering Jazz Age, Chimot was forming not just artistic but literary alliances, with writers such as the Surrealist Gilbert L√©ly, who dedicated the first publication of Ne tue ton p√®re qu‚Äô√† bon escient to Chimot in 1929. On 23 October of that year, √âdouard Chimot must have felt gloriously launched on his late-started career. At the age of 49, he was a significant figure in the Paris art world, a generous patron of his fellow artists, and himself an artist with a public hungry for his late-Symbolist nudes, \\"soumises √† leurs passions mortelles et d√©licieuses\\", as Andr√© Warnod put it. The following day came the Wall Street Crash, which wiped out the market for fancy limited editions. When the last of the books in production for Devambez, Chimot‚Äôs own edition of Parall√®lement, was published in 1931, the game was up. That year a monograph on Chimot by Maurice Rat was published, with a preface by Maurice Magre, in the series Les Artistes du livre, putting the full stop to the glory years of √âdouard Chimot.  Later career  Chimot‚Äôs work in the last three decades of his life shows a sad falling-off from his pinnacle of activity and achievement in the 20s, though inevitably in an artist so richly talented there are flashes of grace and brilliance. In the last year of his life appeared a collection of 16 drawings of female nudes, Les Belles que voil√† : mes mod√®les de Montmartre √† S√©ville, which he regarded as a summary of his lifelong devotion to the female nude. In the 1926 issue of L‚ÄôAmi du Lettr√© (quoted by J.-L. Bernard: III), Chimot wrote, > \\"J‚Äôai choisi la femme comme sujet pr√©f√©r√©, puis unique de mon oeuvre. Je > recherch√© un mod√®le au corps √©legant et mince avec le c√¥t√© moderne, un peu > androgyne. Je fais beaucoup de dessins dans l‚Äôambiance du texte, puis je > choisis parmi eux. La gravure devient une traduction libre de mon dessin. Il > me faut de deux √† quatre semaines pour une gravure. Je ne fais que de l‚Äôeau- > forte.\\" Chimot had fallen in love with Spain while researching the illustrations for his edition of La Femme et le Pantin by Pierre Lou√øs in 1928. During the Second World War, he and his wife Loulou (19 years his junior) took refuge from the war in the holiday house they had bought in Barcelona. Hence Chimot‚Äôs publications afterwards, appeared in Barcelona, and mostly illustrate Spanish- language texts. Chimot died in Paris in 1959. A bibliography of Chimot‚Äôs illustrated booksJ. L. Bernard, √âdouard Chimot, 1880-1959: Bibliographie des oeuvres illustr√©s, (J-L Bernard, 1991). was published in an edition of 200 copies in 1991.  References   Sources  * Anon.

While the commonly understood meaning of the term implies globally distributed resources, the term itself has acquired a broader definition. Gartner, for example, defines global delivery model to encompass a \\"focus on the technical skills, process rigor, tools, methodologies, overall structure and strategies for seamlessly delivering IT-enabled services from global locations\\" Most IT services and consulting firms worldwide make a reference to this model of delivery to signify one or more of the following value propositions they bring to their customers: * A global presence would enable companies to respond fast for changing customer requirements. * A global presence implies that the organization has access to resources of varying costs that allows it to deliver services to its customers at an optimal cost, typically a mix of costlier 'on-site' resources combined with cheaper 'offshore' resources. * A global delivery model implies that potentially, a firm can work round the clock for its customer, handing off work from one location to another at the end of the 'day shift' ('follow the sun' model) - thus providing twice or even three times the capacity they would have if they worked in a single location/ time-zone only. * Global delivery model would bring down cultural differences. Although Global Delivery Model is quite often associated to IT Services/Consulting; it has actually seen its application in several other areas. A few examples where Global Delivery Model exists are illustrated below. * There are several organisations who have discovered there is value in performing tasks at geographic locations that provide most cost efficiencies. As a result, processing employee claims, accounting receivables/payables, etc. follow a Global Delivery model. * Customer services have also seen extensive use of Global Delivery Model where by call center associates are spread globally offering 24/7 service to clients who are in another time zone. * Areas related to processing of Forms, Verification, Legal processing & Documentation, and such are increasingly finding application of Global Delivery. Needless to say Manufacturing has seen the greatest applicability whereby the entire product manufacturing life-cycle has been outsourced to countries like China. Manufacturing has seen such broader outsourcing that things like aircraft wings which is considered to be the core differentiator for any airline manufacturer is also outsourced.

Media Go manages content on Sony family products including Sony Mobile phones, the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Walkman, and Sony Tablet. Similar to iTunes, Media Go can organize, play, and transfer a wide variety of content including videos, photos, music, and podcasts. Media Go also had a storefront that allowed users to purchase movies and TV shows, PSP or PS Vita games, and PSP or PS Vita Comics. Media Go is a replacement for the Sony Creative Software \\"Media Manager\\" applications, used by the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Sony Xperia and Walkman products in the past. Sony has announced the discontinuation of the software by December 2017.  Features  Media Go has many features that can be used to manage and synchronise content. Advanced functionality allows music to be tagged with SensMe metadata, and support for track ratings and purchases that can be made from the PlayStation Store, Sony Xperia's PlayNow Arena or select partner stores (such as BigPond Music, for Telstra customers). Where applicable, Media Go will also automatically download and/or convert certain content (e.g. a podcast) into a suitable format. Media Go can also purchase, backup, and restore PlayStation Portable (PSP) and PlayStation Vita (PS Vita) games and other content, including digital comics; the ability to shop for and purchase PSP or PS Vita content from the PlayStation Store without a PSP or PS Vita connected to the host computer is now supported in current versions of Media Go. As of 2014, the PlayStation Store (except the Download List) is no longer available from Media Go, as it redirects to the PlayStation Store website. Game download and activation was completely disabled on October 24, 2016.http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/11/playstation-store-will-not-be- supported-by-media-go-from-october-24th/ Like iTunes and Windows Media Player, Media Go is also able to \\"rip\\" music from a CD and automatically download missing metadata (album artwork in particular) via Gracenote. , Media Go cannot \\"rip\\" video from a commercial DVD or BD. Media Go also provides \\"drag from\\" behaviour: most multimedia files that are displayed can be dragged from the Media Go application to a Windows Explorer folder, an e-mail message or browser drop target. Like most competing programs though, one of Media Go's primary functions is as a computer multimedia organizer and player/jukebox, with a choice of large or compact/mini interface modes; Media Go also acts as a fully functional picture manager, similar to Microsoft's Windows Media Player. On Media Go, you are also able to copy the media and put it on third party devices (i.e. devices not made by Sony) such as handheld game consoles, smartphones, and MP3 players. To do this you cannot copy from Media Go, you must use a different method unless you are using a PSP, PS Vita, Sony Xperia Smartphone, Sony Xperia Tablet, or Sony WALKMAN. This software can 'watch' selected folders on a computer that a user selects, such as an iTunes folder and any changes in the designated folder will be matched in Media Go. The program also allows the user to manage imported content, so any changes made by the user (such as a change of a track name after using Gracenote) will then be saved so Media Go can properly find the newly edited file. Version 2.2 introduced a new audio editing tool, which gives the user the ability to trim and join an audio file if desired. One of Media Go's main advantages over competing media players is the ability to \\"Rip\\" into FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) meaning users can keep a copy of their CD on their computer with no quality loss. Version 2.7.357 was the last version to support Windows XP.

In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals form a single queue and are governed by a Poisson process, there are c servers and job service times are exponentially distributed. It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server. The model with infinitely many servers is the M/M/‚àû queue. Model definition An M/M/c queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the system, including any currently in service. * Arrivals occur at rate Œª according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i+1. * Service times have an exponential distribution with parameter Œº. If there are fewer than c jobs, some of the servers will be idle. If there are more than c jobs, the jobs queue in a buffer. * The buffer is of infinite size, so there is no limit on the number of customers it can contain. The model can be described as a continuous time Markov chain with transition rate matrix :Q=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -(\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &2\\\\mu & -(2\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&3\\\\mu & -(3\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&\\\\ddots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&&&\\\\ddots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} on the state space {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. The model is a type of birth‚Äìdeath process. We write œÅ = Œª/(c Œº) for the server utilization and require œÅ < 1 for the queue to be stable. œÅ represents the average proportion of time which each of the servers is occupied (assuming jobs finding more than one vacant server choose their servers randomly).

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by ::\\\\text{ C}(c,\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)=\\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{(c\\\\rho)^c}{c!}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho} \\\\right)}{\\\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1} \\\\frac{(c\\\\rho)^k}{k!} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{(c\\\\rho)^c}{c!} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho} \\\\right)}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\left( 1-\\\\rho \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{c!}{(c\\\\rho)^c} \\\\right) \\\\sum_{k=0}^{c-1} \\\\frac{(c\\\\rho)^k}{k!}} which is referred to as Erlang's C formula and is often denoted C(c, Œª/Œº) or E2,c(Œª/Œº). The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by ::\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho} \\\\text{ C}(c,\\\\lambda/\\\\mu) + c \\\\rho. =Busy period of server= The busy period of the M/M/c queue can either refer to *full busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds c‚àí1 customers in the system until a departure which leaves the system with c‚àí1 customers *partial busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds the system empty until a departure which leaves the system again empty. Write Tk = min( t: k jobs in the system at time 0+ and k ‚àí 1 jobs in the system at time t) and Œ∑k(s) for the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of the distribution of Tk. Then # For k > c, Tk has the same distribution as Tc. # For k = c, ::\\\\eta_c(s) = \\\\frac{c \\\\mu}{k \\\\mu + s + \\\\lambda-\\\\lambda \\\\eta_{c}(s)}. # For k < c, ::\\\\eta_k(s) = \\\\frac{k \\\\mu}{k \\\\mu + s + \\\\lambda-\\\\lambda \\\\eta_{k+1}(s)}. =Response time= The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is ::\\\\frac{\\\\text{ C}(c,\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)}{c \\\\mu - \\\\lambda} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}. Customers in first- come, first-served discipline The customer either experiences an immediate exponential service, or must wait for k customers to be served before their own service, thus experiencing an Erlang distribution with shape parameter k + 1. Customers in processor sharing discipline In a processor sharing queue the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. In the M/M/c queue this means that when there are c or fewer jobs in the system, each job is serviced at rate Œº. However, when there are more than c jobs in the system the service rate of each job decreases and is \\\\frac{c\\\\mu}{n} where n is the number of jobs in the system. This means that arrivals after a job of interest can impact the service time of the job of interest. The Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of the response time distribution has been shown to be a solution to a Volterra integral equation from which moments can be computed. An approximation has been offered for the response time distribution. Finite capacity In an M/M/c/K queue only K customers can queue at any one time (including those in service). Any further arrivals to the queue are considered \\"lost\\". We assume that K ‚â• c. The model has transition rate matrix :Q=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -(\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &2\\\\mu & -(2\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&3\\\\mu & -(3\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&\\\\ddots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&&&\\\\ddots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &&&&&&&c;\\\\mu & -(c\\\\mu) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} on the state space {0, 1, 2, ..., c, ..., K}. In the case where c = K, the M/M/c/c queue is also known as the Erlang‚ÄìB model. =Transient analysis= See Tak√°cs for a transient solution and Stadje for busy period results. =Stationary analysis= Stationary probabilities are given by :: \\\\pi_0 = \\\\left[\\\\sum_{k=0}^{c} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^k}{\\\\mu^k k!} + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^c}{\\\\mu^c c!}\\\\sum_{k=c+1}^K \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^{k-c}}{\\\\mu^{k-c} c^{k-c}}\\\\right]^{-1} :: \\\\pi_k = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)^k}{k!}\\\\pi_0 & \\\\text{for } k=1,2,\\\\ldots,c \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)^k}{c^{k-c} c!}\\\\pi_0 & \\\\text{for } k=c+1,\\\\ldots,K. \\\\end{cases} The average number of customers in the system is \\\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} + \\\\pi_0 \\\\frac{\\\\rho (c\\\\rho)^c}{(1-\\\\rho)^2 c!} and number of average response time for a customer is \\\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu} + \\\\pi_0 \\\\frac{\\\\rho (c\\\\rho)^c}{\\\\lambda (1-\\\\rho)^2 c!} . Heavy traffic limits Writing X(t) for the number of customers in the system at time t, it can be shown that under three different conditions the process ::\\\\hat X_n(t) = \\\\frac{X(nt) - \\\\mathbb E(X(nt))}{\\\\sqrt{n}} converges to a diffusion process. # Fix Œº and c, increase Œª and scale by n = 1/(1 ‚àí œÅ)2. # Fix Œº and œÅ, increase Œª and c, and scale by n = c. # Fix as a constant Œ≤ where ::\\\\beta = (1-\\\\rho)\\\\sqrt{s} and increase Œª and c using the scale n = c or n = 1/(1 ‚àí œÅ)2. This case is called the Halfin‚ÄìWhitt regime.

Brewer played two seasons of professional football with the Cleveland Indians and the Akron Pros in the National Football League (NFL). He was considered one of the best high school quarterbacks in the country and played college football at Maryland State College. Brewer was also an accomplished track and field athlete. Early life Brewer was born on November 21, 1894 in Washington, D.C. He attended the St. Albans School, where he played baseball and football and competed in track and field.ROBERTSON'S JOB AT PENN; Quakers' New Trainer Will Have Little Material at Outset, The New York Times, July 7, 1916. Brewer beat Olympian Howard Drew in the 50-yard dash, and was considered one of the finest athletes in the nation. In 1916 he was part of the St Albans team that won the Prep School Mile Relay Championship at the Penn Relays.St Alban's Winner of Titles in Relays, Washington Post, April 30, 1916 The New York Times also called him one of the best quarterbacks in the South. He originally intended to go to the University of Pennsylvania,PENN TO GET TWO STARS.; Athletes Frank Sloman and Brooke Brewer to Enter University, The New York Times, April 11, 1916. but instead attended Maryland State College, which is now known as the University of Maryland. College and military service Brewer while stationed at Camp Crane Brewer enrolled at Maryland in 1916. That year, he competed in the 60-yard dash and 70-yard high hurdles events.HARVARD CLUB TEAM WINS.; Beats Columbia Club at Squash -- Yale Club Defeats Casino, The New York Times, December 29, 1916. He also set a world record for the indoor 50-yard dash and ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds. In addition to track, Brewer also played football during the 1916 season.All-Time Lettermen, 2007 Terrapin Football Record Book, University of Maryland, 2007. The following year, Brewer left college in order to enter the United States Army during World War I. He was stationed at Camp Crane in Allentown, Pennsylvania to train as part of the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps (USAAC) before deployment to France. While in Pennsylvania, he played on the \\"Usaacs\\" football team.\\"The Usaacs Are Coming!\\", Outing, p. 38, 1918.

By 1920, Brewer was back at Maryland and participated in football and track for two more seasons. The football team's successes in 1920 and 1921 were largely credited to Brewer's drop-kicking ability. In track, he served as the captain for his final season in 1922. He was also a member of the Kappa Alpha Order.Terra Mariae, University of Maryland, Baltimore Yearbook, Class of 1922, p. 52, 1922.

Birth and education  Vladimir was born on 11 March 1863 in the village of Samostrely (now Korets Raion of Rivne Oblast). His father, grandfather and great grandfather were clergymen. The Lipsky family moved to Zhitomir in 1873. Vladimir studied at the Volhynian Gymnasium; he graduated from Pavlo Galagan Collegium (magna cum laude) in 1881, and Kiev University in 1887. The formation of Vladimir Lipsky as a scientist was considerably influenced by Johannes Schmalhausen, who headed the Chair of Plant Taxonomy and Morphology.  Career  From 1887 to 1894 Vladimir Lipsky worked with the Botanical Garden of Kiev University first as conservator, then as assistant at the Chair of Botanics. He took part in scientific expeditions to the Caucasus and Northern Iran from 1889. Between 1894 and 1917, Lipsky worked with the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden as Junior and Senior Conservator of the herbarium, Chief Botanist, and eventually Head of the Living Plants Department. Lipsky participated in scientific expeditions to the Caucasus, Altai and Central Asia conducting detailed studies of the Alpine flora of the regions. In 1917 he returned to Ukraine and actively participated in the creation of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, holding the Botany Chair of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. He was the President of the Academy from 1922 to 1928. Between 1928 and 1933 he was the Director of the Botanical Gardens of the Odessa University in Odessa.  Research  Vladimir did research in the fields of floristics, plant taxonomy and phytogeography of plants, herbarium work, principles of organization of botanical gardens, history of botany. He became one of the first botanists to provide scientific descriptions of the flora of Indonesia, Tunisia, Algeria, and Central Asia. In particular, Vladimir Lipsky described 4 new genera, and 220 new species of plant, 45 of which are named after him. He also authored 82 printed works. = First Kiev period = Upon graduation from the University, Vladimir participated in numerous scientific expeditions: Podolia, Bessarabia, Crimea, Caucasus and Central Asia. Lipsky's first academic work appeared in 1889: Research in Flora of Bessarabia (, Issledovaniye o flore Bessarabii), where, inter alia, a new species of plants was described: Valerianella bessarabica. Vladimir published a number of his reports on his expeditions at the Proceedings of Kiev Society of Nature Researchers (¬´–ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –¥–æ—Å–ª—ñ–¥–Ω–∏–∫—ñ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–∏¬ª, Zapiski Kyivskogo Tovaristva Doslidnykiv Prirody). Starting from 1889, Vladimir visited the Caucasus several times to research the plants of the region. The journeys resulted in the description of about 40 new species and subvarieties of plants. In order to identify distinctive character of Caucasian flora and to do comparative studies, he also visited Northern Iran. Lipsky published the results of the Caucasian flora studies in his treatise Flora of Caucasus.

In particular, the book lists 4,500 species of plants and provides accurate data of their distribution. The botanist described three new genera of flowering plants: Beketowia, Orthorhiza and Schumannia. The following plants can be noted among new Caucasian plants described by Vladimir Lipsky: Dioscorea caucasica, Fagus orientalis, Levisticum caucasicum, Potentilla alexeenkoi, Tulipa caucasica, Hypericum ponticum, and many others. = St. Petersburg period = Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis), a plant discovered and studied by Vladimir Lipsky Starting from 1894 Lipsky worked at the botanical garden of St. Petersburg. From 1894 through 1896 he continued his studies of Caucasian plants commenced while in Kyiv. After 1896 he started researching alpine plants of Central Asia highlands. The botanist explored southern slopes of Gissar Range, Pamiro-Alai, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Kopet Dag, Fergana Valley and Zeravshan Valley, becoming the first botanist visiting many of the areas. The expeditions resulted in more than thirty works and treatises, including: * Materials for Flora of Central Asia (¬´–ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –¥–ª—è —Ñ–ª–æ—Ä—ã –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏¬ª); * Flora of Central Asia, i.e. Russian Turkestan and Bukhara and Khiva Khanates (¬´–§–ª–æ—Ä–∞ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏, —Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –¢—É—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ —Ö–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤ –ë—É—Ö–∞—Ä—ã –∏ –•–∏–≤—ã¬ª); * Mountainous Bukhara (¬´–ì–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –ë—É—Ö–∞—Ä–∞¬ª). In those treatises Lipsky revised botanical knowledge of the above areas, rectified errors of predecessors, and described about a hundred new species and four new genera: Korshinskia, Galagania, Koslovia, Ladyginia. The botanist paid much attention to the history of the Petersburg Botanical Garden and its herbaria and collections. He published the results of his research in the following works: * Herbarium of the Saint-Petersburg Botanical Garden by the End of 75th year of its Existence, 1823‚Äì1898 (¬´–ì–µ—Ä–±–∞—Ä–∏–π –°.-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–¥–∞ –∫ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü—É –µ–≥–æ 75-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–≥–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è, 1823‚Äì1898¬ª), * Historical Overview of Saint-Petersburg Botanical Garden, 1713‚Äì1913 (¬´–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫ –°.-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–¥–∞, 1713‚Äì1913¬ª), * Biographies and Literary Activities of Botanists and Persons Associated with the Botanical Garden (¬´–ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –∏ –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –ª–∏—Ü, —Å–æ–ø—Ä–∏–∫–∞—Å–∞–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è —Å –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º —Å–∞–¥–æ–º¬ª). Map of the Botanical Garden in Palermo made by Vladimir Lipsky (1903) Between 1900 and 1902 Vladimir Lipsky visited various countries studying herbaria and botanical gardens. In total, he succeeded in visiting all continents of the Earth, save for Australia and Antarctica. = Second Kiev period = Upon recommendation of the first President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (UAS) Vladimir Vernadsky, on 30 December 1918, at the meeting of the UAS 2nd Physics and Mathematics Department, elected Vladimir Lipsky a director of new botanical garden in Kyiv. In addition to managing the Botanical Garden, Vladimir also chaired Flower Plant Chair of the UAS and participated actively in creation of various Academy structures, such as: * UAS Committee for Studies of Natural Wealth of Ukraine (formed in March 1919), * Committee for Studies of Ukrainian Fauna, * Publishing Committee of the 2nd UAS Department, * Encyclopedic Dictionary Committee (Head), * Committee for Audit of UAS Library. Also he represented the Academy at the Military and Industrial Committee. In 1919 Vladimir Lipsky was unanimously elected an active member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; in 1920 he was elected a member of the UAS Board, and in 1921 its Vice President. Vladimir initiated creation of the UAS Botanical Garden, developed a plan of the Garden and started its actual creation in the yard of the Praesidium of the Academy of Sciences on Vladimirskaya Street in Kyiv. Today's Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences was formed in 1935 in the Kyiv district of Zvirynets. In August 1919, after Stepan Timoshenko, Secretary of the 2nd Department of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences left the country, Vladimir started acting as the Secretary, and in October 1921 he was elected Vice President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. On a general meeting of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences held 12 June 1922, Vladimir Lipsky was elected its President. Attempts by Soviet authorities to influence the activities of scientific institutions affected Lipsky's fate too. In order to examine the work of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, a commission of the Ukrainian People's Commissariat of Education was formed. In its findings the commission accused the management of the Academy, and first of all the Presidium headed by Lipsky, of failure to comply with Soviet laws, and charged them with political violations. The commission suggested immediate re-election of the President of the Academy, rerunning the procedure of confirming membership in the Academy, and establishing a rigid structure and personnel pool for the Academy. Communist Party leaders thought Vladimir Lipsky to be a 'politically inert' President, who delegated management of the Academy to Serhiy Yefremov and Ahatanhel Krymsky. In 1928 Vladimir sent in his resignation from the position of the President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. = Odessa period = On 21 June 1928, having resigned as the President of the Academy, Vladimir Lipsky moved to Odessa, where he headed the Odessa Botanical Garden. During his work in Odessa, he greatly contributed to the research in the Botanical Garden and its expansion, training of young researchers and sorting and arranging the herbarium. During 1927‚Äì1930 he studied algae of the Black Sea (in particular, in the vicinity of , researched influence of vegetation of the Atmanaysky estuary in the Azov Sea on saline formation and deposition; he participated in the work of the Ukrainian Institute for resin and rubber plants. He was particularly interested in the studies of red Phyllophora. This algae became raw material to manufacture iodine and agar-agar, which were then imported from abroad. So called iodine expeditions in the Black Sea were carried out in 1930‚Äì1931 on board of Sirena yacht, Drug Zhizni and Lyskovsky ships, and as a result, thanks to Vladimir Lipsky's efforts, the first in Ukraine iodine plant was opened in 1931 in Odessa. Vladimir was Odessa Botanical Garden Director until 1933, then he resigned in protest against the ideas of Trofim Lysenko and until his death he worked as a scientific consultant of the Odessa Botanical Garden. He made his last research trip to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in 1936. Vladimir Lipsky died on 24 February 1937 in Odessa. = Some plants discovered by or named after Vladimir Lipsky = * Fagus orientalis * Artemisia lipskyi * Inula magnifica Lipsky  Memory  Two new genera were named after Vladimir Lipsky: Lipskya of family Apiaceae and Lipskyella of family Asteraceae.International Plant Names Index 54 new species of plants were named after Vladimir Lipsky (including Stipa lipskyi, Euphorbia lipskyi, Thymus lipskyi, Acer lipskyi),International Plant Names Index which were included into floristic collections of all countries. During the 1950s, the grave and tombstone of Vladimir Lipsky were destroyed and the place of his burial was lost. Only upon request of the Presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, in 1990 the Executive Committee of the Odessa City Council issued a decree memorializing Academic Vladimir Lipsky.

He and Terri had three children, Brett, Brandi, and Aaron. Of his three children only Brett followed his father's footsteps on the race track, starting his riding career shortly after his father's retirement. His son, Brett, currently works for Emerald Downs and gallops in the morning. He began riding at age 16 and came to Seattle to ride in 1963. In 1966 he set a world record on Sandy Fleet going 6¬Ω furlongs. 4 years later he was to break this record on a little-known horse who would later make Washington Thoroughbred Horse history, Turbulator. One of the most noted rides that Pierce and Turbulator had was a loss in the Longacres Mile in 1970 when the horse banged into the gate at the start breaking his left stirrup. Pierce managed to stay on board but was beaten by 2 lengths and finished in 5th place. Pierce earned his only win in the Longacres Mile in 1973 on Silver Mallet. Larry Pierce retired from riding in 1984 and turned to training at Longacres until the racetrack shut down in 1992. He continued training afterwards at Emerald Downs and Yakima Meadows. Larry Pierce ranked second all-time leading riders with 63 stakes wins at Longacres (Gary Baze, who is currently still riding holds first place).

Donaldson (January 17, 1854 ‚Äì December 20, 1941) was an American architect and artist born on January 17, 1854, in Stirling, Scotland. Donaldson was principal designer of the successful Detroit-based architectural firm Donaldson and Meier from 1880 onwards. Early years In 1856 John and Isabella (McNaughten) Donaldson immigrated to Detroit, Michigan with their two-year-old son John. He graduated from the Detroit Public Schools and later from the Polytechnic College. Following that he returned to Europe where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany, at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, finishing his European art studies in Venice, Italy. Success in Detroit Pere Marquette at the Detroit City Hall He returned to Detroit and in 1874 was invited to produce architectural sculpture for the Detroit City Hall then being built. For this building Donaldson made a model of a statue of Pere Marquette that was carved in stone by Julius Melchers. When the building was demolished in the 1950s the statue was salvaged and now stands on the campus of Wayne State University. In 1878 Donaldson joined in partnership with architect Henry T. Brush, but Brush's death a year later in 1879 ended it. In 1882, Donaldson married Charlotte Grosvenor Brush, his former partner's widow. In 1880, he formed a partnership with Henry J. Meier, Donaldson and Meier. Though Meier died in 1917, the firm continued as Donaldson and Meier until the 1970s. Donaldson was a member of the American Institute of Architects and the National Sculpture Society. In 1900, Donaldson wrote a letter for the Detroit Century Box time capsule.

Yusuf (, ', \\"Joseph\\") is the 12th chapter (Surah) of the Quran and has 111 Ayahs (verses).The Noble Quran (Surah 12) It is preceded by s≈´rah Hud and followed by Ar-Ra‚Äôd (The thunder). Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it was revealed toward the end of the Makkan period, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. It is said to have been revealed in a single sitting and is unique in this respect. The text narrates the story of Yusuf (Joseph) who is considered a prophet in Islam, whose life and mission it recounts. Unlike the accounts of other Islamic prophets, different elements and aspects of which are related in different surahs, the life-history of Yusuf, is narrated in this surah only, in full and in chronological order. This surah, which also tells of the truth, according to Muslims, contained in dreams, presents many principles of how to serve Islam by relating the life- history of a prophet, who became the most renowned and respected figure in the country to which he had been sold as a slave. The surah was first translated into Latin by Thomas van Erpe in 1617 and later in the 17th century published synoptically in Arabic and Latin as part of the Lutheran efforts at translating the Qur'an.Alastair Hamilton, \\"A Lutheran Translator for the Qur'an: A Late Seventeenth-Century Quest\\". Taken from The Republic of Letters And the Levant, p. 197. Eds. Alastair Hamilton, Maurits H. Van Den Boogert and Bart Westerweel. Volume 5 of Intersections. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2005. Narrative The story of Sura Y≈´suf is about the Prophet Y≈´suf, translated in English as Joseph. Y≈´suf is one of the sons of Ya'qub (known as Jacob in the English translation) who has the talent of interpreting dreams. One day Y≈´suf has a dream and he narrates his dream to his father who immediately knows that Y≈´suf will be a prophet. His father tells him not to tell his brothers to avoid any harm. However, because of Ya'qub's loving treatment towards Y≈´suf, Y≈´suf's brothers felt jealous. They wanted to get rid of Y≈´suf, so their father could love them instead of Y≈´suf. Their initial plan was to kill Y≈´suf, but later they decided to throw him in a well. They lied to their father and told him that a wolf had killed him. Later, a caravan rescued Y≈´suf from the well, who then sold him to a 'Al-Aziz in Egypt. The 'Al-Aziz took Y≈´suf in and was hoping to either put him to work or adopt him as a son. Later, the man's wife tries to seduce Y≈´suf, but he resists. The woman seeing his resistance accuses Y≈´suf of wanting to harm her and demands that he should either be punished severely or sent to jail. A witness, after Y≈´suf defends his innocence, testifies \\"if his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars but if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.\\" The shirt was indeed torn from the back. Soon after this accident, the women of the city talk of how the wife is seeking to seduce Y≈´suf. The wife of 'Al-Aziz invites them to a banquet, gives each of them a knife, and then tells Y≈´suf to come out. The women cut their hands in astonishment. 'She said, \\"That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased.\\" Y≈´suf prefers prison to what they call him so he prayed to God. Y≈´suf is sent to prison. In the prison, Y≈´suf met two other men and interprets one of the prisoner's dreams. The prisoner is then released and Y≈´suf asked the prisoner to mention his talent to the king. One day, the King had a dream and the prisoner who had been released mention Y≈´suf. He interprets the King's dream, which is about Egypt having a seven-year drought. To reward him, the King requests his release from jail and the King also investigates his case. The wife who tried to seduce Y≈´suf testifies that he was innocent, and the truth unveils. Y≈´suf is given authority in Egypt. During the seven-year drought, Y≈´suf's brothers visit Egypt to get food for their family. Upon seeing his brothers, Y≈´suf recognizes them though they did not recognize him. Y≈´suf, in a high position of authority, requests that the next time they come, they bring their youngest brother Benjamin with them. When the brothers returned with their youngest brother, Y≈´suf takes him aside and tells him his identity. Y≈´suf plots a theft case where his youngest brother is found guilty of theft when he is truly innocent and is detained from his family, so he could stay with him. Later, when the father and brothers face poverty they come back to Y≈´suf and Y≈´suf then helps them and reveals his identity asking them to come and live with him. Revelation There is no confirmed time when surat Y≈´suf was supposedly revealed, but it is estimated to be either in the 10th or 11th year of dawah. In other words, it is known to have been revealed 2 or 3 years before the hijrah (Migration) from Makkah to Madina which is close to the end of the Makkan era and Makkan journey. This Sura was revealed after a year the scholars of seerah call 'am al huzun' (the year of Sorrow or Despair). This year was a sad and depressing time for Muhammad. He was going through several hardships and three of those are the most significant. The first one is his uncle Abu Talib's death. Abu Talib was the only father figure he had left and one of the people who protected him from the harms of society. The second tragedy would come with his beloved first wife, Khadijah's death. She was the first to believe in his message and she was his comfort. The two deaths were a significant loss to him as they were the people in his life that motivated and protected him through his journey. Later on in Makkah after his uncle's death, the pagans made him face excessive hardships while he tried to call the people to Islam. Expecting a better reply from the city of Ta'if, Muhammad departs Makkah. However, to his disappointment, the people of Ta'if did not welcome him, gave him a hard time and chased him out of the city by throwing rocks at him. He was injured, bleeding and left with nothing but disappointment from the people of Ta'if. This sura was meant to uplift his spirits and comfort him in his time of rejection. =Other findings= Along with the three crucial events that marked the revelation for Muhammad, scholars have mentioned other incidents that led to the revelation of the sura. The Quraysh wanted to test Muhammad, as they were in disbelief of his knowledge and spiritual capabilities. They did not believe him to be a prophet and planned to trick him by asking a question that only a true prophet would be able to answer. The story of Y≈´suf and his brothers, was one that was not heard of, as the people of Makkah held no knowledge of this story. Also translated as Joseph (son of Jacob) it was known to the Christian and Jewish cultures and not heard of by the Quraysh. To recite this story would show true prophecy, but people had no faith that Muhammad would possess this gift. When Muhammad was questioned, he revealed through his revelation all his knowledge about the untold story. Following the hardships faced within the city of Makkah, the story of Y≈´suf was later revealed to uplift people's spirits. They questioned, \\"O Messenger of Allah, why don't you tell us the stories of those before us who also suffered?\\" This was a time of abrupt chaos as the Muslims were being persecuted and later forced to leave. This posed as the second conclusion to the revelation. Hadith Culture It has been narrated by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, a great-grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, that the individual who recites Surah Y≈´suf during every day or every night will be resurrected on the Day of Judgement with beauty resembling the beauty of Y≈´suf. He will not fear the Day of Judgement and will be among the best of the believers. Prophet Muhammad is reported to have encouraged the teaching of Surah Y≈´suff to slaves, claiming that \\"whenever a Muslim recites it and teaches it to his family and slaves, Allah would ease for him the pangs of death and make it so that no Muslim would envy him\\" Major themes =The faith of the Prophets= The faiths of the Prophets before Muhammad were the same as his. Prophets Ibrahim, Ishaaq, Ya'q≈´b and Y≈´suf invited the people to the same message as Muhammad. =Character of a Muslim= * Has awareness of Allah and accountability of one's deeds * Pursues one's goals while remaining under the limits prescribed by the Divine Law * Believes that success and failure are entirely in the hands of God, whatever Allah wills happen and no one can prevent it * Applies their efforts towards the truth and puts one's trust in Allah =Confidence and courage= Throughout the story of Y≈´suf, Allah taught the believers that a person who possesses true Islamic character can master the world with the strength of their character. The example of the Prophet Y≈´suf shows that a person of high and pure character can overcome severe circumstances and be successful. =Objectives of this Surah= # To provide proof that Muhammad's Prophethood and his knowledge is not based on unsubstantiated information, rather but was gained through revelation. # It applies the theme of the story to the people of Quraysh (The tribe of the leaders in Makah) and warns that the conflict between them and the Prophet would end in his victory over them.

Early life and education  Blood was born in 1893, the son of Alban Francis Blood and his wife Adelaide Therese Feldtmann, in Kilmarnock. His father was the rector of Holy Trinity Church in Kilmarnock. Blood grew up at the parsonage and attended Irvine Royal Academy. Blood sat the bursary competition of the University of Glasgow and finished in the top 50. He matriculated with an arts degree in 1911, taking distinction in Latin, Hellenistic Greek, and Moral Philosophy. He failed Geography, and re- sat it to graduate with an MA in 1914. Blood served with the 4th Royal Scots Fusiliers during World War I. He achieved the rank of Captain. He was wounded in Gallipoli and afterwards walked with a limp.  Colonial service  Blood initially wanted to study for the Episcopalian ministry but changed his mind and in 1920 he entered the Ceylon Civil Service. He served in Ceylon between 1920 and 1930 before being appointed as Colonial Secretary of Grenada in 1930, and then Colonial Secretary of Sierra Leone in 1934. In 1942, Blood became Governor of the Gambia, the first of three governorships. His administration was responsible for drawing up plans of how the Colonial Development and Welfare Act funds were to be spent. During his time, the modernization of the Bathurst water system, the establishment of a sewage system, paved streets, and improvements to the port all took place. Blood also established the Bathurst Town Council in 1946, introducing a new constitution for direct elections later that year. He then served as Governor of Barbados from 1947 to 1949, and Governor of Mauritius from 1949 to 1954. His experience equipped him with an understanding of the problems British territories faced when seeking self-government. His expertise was called on as a constitutional commissioner to help frame governments in British Honduras, Zanzibar, and Malta. He also wrote a number of articles and reviews in the academic journal African Affairs. In 1944, he was knighted, and in the same year he received an honorary doctor of laws from Glasgow University.

Excerpt from a manuscript of the beguinage of Sint-Aubertus, Ghent, ca. 1840. In Western-Europe the era of the beguinages started in the 12th century. In Ghent they started building 2 beguinages in 1234. They were founded by the countesses Johanna and Margaretha of Flanders. A large part of the beguinage leaned against the city wall. It gave shelter to the beguines coming from small nobility and the newly formed middle class. The beguinage as it is now dates mostly of the 17th and 18th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries it was partly restored, but the restorations are hardly noticeable. With the French occupation of Belgium the beguinage with all it possessions became property of the Commissie der Burgerlijke Godshuizen van de Stad Gent.:nl:Klein Begijnhof (Gent) And in 1801 it was a legitimately acknowledged religious community. In the year 1862 the Duke of Arenberg bought the entire beguinage from the Commission. After World War I the duke had to relinquish his rights because he was a German citizen. And then finally in 1925, the newly founded non-profit organisation Begijnhof O.L.V. Ter Hoyen bought the entire beguinage complex. The beguinage became a protected monument on October 30, 1963. The architecture of the beguinage The gate is neoclassical and dates from 1819. It is the only point of entrance and exit. All the buildings are situated within the walls of the beguinage. The lawn in the courtyard is surrounded by lime trees and beech trees. The surrounding buildings have white walls and green little gates. geheel mee. The church is a dedicated to our Lady. It was built between 1654-1658 and in 1716 it was given a baroque fa√ßade. The image of the horsemen refers to the Apocalypse and is situated against the south wall. The seven stations of the circumambulation in honour of our Lady of the Seven Sorrows testify to the devotion of the citizens. The building where the Mistress of the beguines and her staff lived is situated in the northern corner of the beguinage. There you also find the farm and the hospital with the chapel dedicated to Saint Godelieve. Around the beguinage pasture and the ‚ÄòAchterstraat‚Äô are about 100 houses and 7 convents, all of which bear the name of a saint. Most of the houses have a little front yard, enclosed by a high wall and a gate with a peephole. All the houses have one storey and an attic, some of them also have a basement and a little back yard.

The pathophysiology of hypertension is an area which attempts to explain mechanistically the causes of hypertension, which is a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90‚Äì95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. Some authorities define essential hypertension as that which has no known explanation, while others define its cause as being due to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of potassium. Secondary hypertension indicates that the hypertension is a result of a specific underlying condition with a well-known mechanism, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the aorta or kidney arteries, or endocrine disorders such as excess aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines. Persistent hypertension is a major risk factor for hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Cardiac output and peripheral resistance are the two determinants of arterial pressure. Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume and heart rate; stroke volume is related to myocardial contractility and to the size of the vascular compartment. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small arteries and arterioles. Genetics Single gene mutations can cause Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes have been identified which cause these monogenic forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering kidney salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, and this is not due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings suggest that there are many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension. Autonomic nervous system The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis via pressure, volume, and chemoreceptor signals. It does this by regulating the peripheral vasculature, and kidney function, which in turn affect cardiac output, vascular resistance, and fluid retention. Excess activity of the sympathetic nervous system increases blood pressure and contributes to hypertension. The mechanisms of increased sympathetic nervous system activity in hypertension involve alterations in baroreflex and chemoreflex pathways at both peripheral and central levels. Arterial baroreceptors are reset to a higher pressure in hypertensive patients, and this peripheral resetting reverts to normal when arterial pressure is normalized. Furthermore, there is central resetting of the aortic baroreflex in hypertensive patients, resulting in suppression of sympathetic inhibition after activation of aortic baroreceptor nerves. This baroreflex resetting seems to be mediated, at least partly, by a central action of angiotensin II. Additional small-molecule mediators that suppress baroreceptor activity and contribute to exaggerated sympathetic drive in hypertension include reactive oxygen species and endothelin. Some studies shown that hypertensive patients manifest greater vasoconstrictor responses to infused norepinephrine than normotensive controls. And that hypertensive patients do not show the normal response to increased circulating norepinephrine levels which generally induces downregulation of noradrenergic receptor, and it is believed that this abnormal response is genetically inherited. Exposure to stress increases sympathetic outflow, and repeated stress-induced vasoconstriction may result in vascular hypertrophy, leading to progressive increases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. This could partly explain the greater incidence of hypertension in lower socioeconomic groups, since they must endure greater levels of stress associated with daily living. Persons with a family history of hypertension manifest augmented vasoconstrictor and sympathetic responses to laboratory stressors, such as cold pressor testing and mental stress, that may predispose them to hypertension. This is particularly true of young African Americans. Exaggerated stress responses may contribute to the increased incidence of hypertension in this group. Resistant hypertension can be treated by electrically stimulating the baroreflex with a pacemaker-like device. Renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system Another system maintaining the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, and that if disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system. Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) angiotensinogen, secreted from the liver, into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This cleavage produces angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide.Brenner & Rector's The Kidney, 7th ed., Saunders, 2004. pp.2118-2119.Full Text with MDConsult subscription Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46 ng/ml in the upright position)Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program - Laboratory Reference Centre Manual. Renin Direct leads to hypertension. Recent studies claim that obesity is a risk factor for hypertension because of activation of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system (RAS) in adipose tissue, and also linked renin‚Äìangiotensin system with insulin resistance, and claims that anyone can cause the other. Local production of angiotensin II in various tissues, including the blood vessels, heart, adrenals, and brain, is controlled by ACE and other enzymes, including the serine protease chymase. The activity of local renin‚Äìangiotensin systems and alternative pathways of angiotensin II formation may make an important contribution to remodeling of resistance vessels and the development of target organ damage (i.e. left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and arterial aneurysm) in hypertensive persons. Endothelial dysfunction The endothelium of blood vessels produces an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the endothelium, are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with essential hypertension, the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads to changes in the endothelium and sets up a \\"vicious cycle\\" that contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of target organ damage and atherosclerotic disease, as well as prognosis. Evidence suggests that oxidant stress alters many functions of the endothelium, including modulation of vasomotor tone. Inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) by superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) seems to occur in conditions such as hypertension. Normally nitric oxide is an important regulator and mediator of numerous processes in the nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems, including smooth muscle relaxation thus resulting in vasodilation of the artery and increasing blood flow, suppressor of migration and proliferation of vascular smooth-muscle cells. It has been suggested that angiotensin II enhances formation of the oxidant superoxide at concentrations that affect blood pressure minimally. Endothelin is a potent vasoactive peptide produced by endothelial cells that has both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties. Circulating endothelin levels are increased in some hypertensive patients, particularly African Americans and persons with hypertension. Sodium/potassium ratio hypothesis of essential hypertension A 2007 review article states that while excessive sodium consumption has long been recognized as contributing to the risk of hypertension, \\"potassium, the main intracellular cation, has usually been viewed as a minor factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, abundant evidence indicates that a potassium deficit has a critical role in hypertension and its cardiovascular sequelae.\\" The authors state that modern, western, high sodium, low potassium diets result in corresponding changes in intracellular concentration of these, the two most important cations in animal cells. This imbalance leads to contraction of vascular smooth muscle, restricting blood flow and so driving up blood pressure. The authors cite studies which showing that potassium supplementation is effective in reducing hypertension. Epidemiological support for this hypothesis can be found in a 2014 meta-analysis which states that \\"the sodium-to-potassium ratio appears to be more strongly associated with blood pressure outcomes than either sodium or potassium alone in hypertensive adult populations.\\".

He was the 18th Governor of Mauritius, from 1897 to 1903. Early life Charles Bruce was born in India in 1836, the son of Thomas Bruce, of Arnott, Kinross-shire, who worked for many years for the Honourable East India Company. His father was a descendant of the 9th Earl of Home. Young Charles was educated at Harrow and Yale University. In early life he went to Germany, and devoted himself to the study of Oriental language and literature, mainly Sanskrit and Zend-Pahlavi. He assisted in preliminary work for the Great Sandskrit Dictionary by Otto von B√∂htlingk and Rudolf von Roth (Sanskrit W√∂rterbuch, 7 vols., 1855‚Äì75), published by the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. It was through this connection he was able to get the academy to publish his work Die Geschichte von Nala (1862), an attempt to restore the original text of an episode in the Indian epic, the Mahabharata. While serving as a librarian at the British Museum, he was in 1865 elected Professor of Sanskrit at King's College, Cambridge. Colonial administrator Bruce left for Mauritius in 1868, to take up position as Rector of the Royal College in Port Louis. He held this post for 10 years, until he transferred to Ceylon in 1878 to become Director of Public Instruction. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1881 Birthday Honours for his service during his years in Ceylon. By 1882 he was back in Mauritius as Colonial Secretary, but left for British Guiana in 1885 to become Lieutenant- Governor. He continued as such until 1893, during which he was three times Acting Governor, and in 1889 was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). In 1893, Bruce was appointed Governor of the Windward Islands. The colony of the Windward Islands consisted at this time of Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Lucia, the Governor had his seat in Grenada. Bruce was appointed Governor of Mauritius in May 1897. The six years of his tenure as governor, until 1903, were marked by substantial progress. With the support of the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, he reformed every public department and took measures to prepare the island to meet frequent devastating hurricanes. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in August 1901, on the occasion of the royal visit of Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) His work The Broad Stone of Empire (1910) described his experience of the problems with Crown colony administration. Later life On his return to the United Kingdom, Bruce became a campaigner for Indian immigrants and settlers in other British colonies, especially in South Africa. He was an early member of the committee formed in London to uphold their claims, and in June 1908 he headed a representative deputation to ask Lord Crewe for the intervention of the Home Government. He was also a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant for Kinross-shire Family Lady Bruce, n√©e Clara Lucas (d. 1916).

The flesh is white, fibrous, and does not change color. The mushroom is saprophytic. It is listed as a vulnerable species. The threat to this species is over-growing of ungrazed and unmowed meadows. The species is similar to Macrolepiota procera, although the latter is bigger. Edibility The flesh is white, tender, and has a pleasant taste, best when it is consumed while it is young. The flesh tastes like hazelnut. The odor of the species is weak. The mushroom is similar to numerous toxic species so harvesting them is problematic. It has been advised by the website Memento des champignons (Memento of Fungus) to not collect specimens by roadsides. The collection period for the mushroom is from mid-summer to late autumn.

Origins Julius Charles Drew (he changed the spelling to Drewe in 1913) was born at the vicarage in Pulloxhill near Ampthill in Bedfordshire, the son of Rev. George Smith Drew (1819‚Äì1880), Rector of Avington,Burke's, 1937, p.643 Winchester, by his wife Mary Peek, the eldest child of William Peek of Loddiswell, Devon and first cousin of Sir Henry William Peek, 1st Baronet (1825‚Äì1898) of Rousdon, Devon.Burke's, 1937, p.643 Julius was the third youngest of eight children. His siblings Mary, Edith, Ada, Reginald, William, Anna and Evelyn all moved, either to different parts of the United Kingdom or to the Colonies, including British North America. He was the nephew of Richard Peek, a Sheriff of the City of London. =Early origins= Julius' father, Rev. George Smith Drew, was born 22 October 1818 in Kensington, then a village on the outskirts of London, to an affluent family. He was a clergyman and serial publisher. Julius' mother was Mary Peek, born 13 March 1821 in Islington. Julius' grandfather, George H. Drew, was born in Belgravia, in Westminster in 1790 but at the age of four moved with his parents to their country house in the South Hams, Devonshire. George moved back to London aged twenty-one and became a tea merchant during the birth of the Industrial Revolution. The Drew family had close ties with the French aristocracy in the eighteenth century by the lineage of King Louis XIII of France through his great-granddaughter. As a result of this, Thomas Drew (Julius' great- grandfather) was born 1745 in Gironde, France. Thomas later migrated back to England with his father at a young age, at some time before the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1789, and became an architect based in Sloane Street, Westminster.Burke's, 1937, p.643 Career As a child he attended the renowned and prestigious Bedford School between 1862 and 1874, a traditional private boarding school founded by King Edward VI. After leaving school at eighteen years of age, Julius started his working life as a tea buyer in China for his uncle Francis Peek (c.1836‚Äì99), a partner in Liverpool tea-merchants Peek and Winch. Julius‚Äôs great uncle, Richard Peek (1782‚Äì1867), one of the three brothers who founded Peek and Winch, was an abolitionist and philanthropist who was on the organising committee of the anti-slavery conventions held in London in 1840 and 1843. Julius opened his first tea shop four years later in Liverpool in 1878, aged only twenty-one. In 1883, Drewe and John Musker (1846‚Äì1926) founded the Home and Colonial Trading Association, which sold teas selected in India by Drewe, alongside other groceries. By 1903, the company had 500 stores. In 1883 he moved to London to expand his enterprises. The business developed rapidly under the name of Home and Colonial Stores. After only six years, in 1889, he and his partner, John Musker, were able to retire from active participation in the firm as extremely rich men. Drew was only thirty-two years old. In 1919 they sold their shares in the business for ¬£3.5 million (estimated at ¬£193 million today), then a huge sum.Wadhurst History Society Genealogist With his brother William he had always taken a keen interest in the history of the Drew family. A genealogist convinced him that his family was descended from the 16th century gentry family of Drewe of Sharpham, in the parish of Ashprington, near Totnes, Devon, which from the early 17th century to 1903 resided at The Grange in the parish of Broadhembury near Honiton in Devon. Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed. Pirie-Gordon, H., London, 1937, p.643, pedigree of Drewe of Castle Drogo Furthermore, the genealogist also produced an \\"authenticated descent\\"Burke's, 1937, p.643 claiming to prove a link between the Drewe family of The Grange and the 12th century Anglo-Norman Dru (Latinized to Drogo), who in the reign of King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189)Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.244 was lord of the manor of Teignton, later Drew's Teignton. However, by 1242 the manor of Teignton had passed from the Dru/Drogo family and was held by the Daubernon (or Dabernon) family.Pole, p.244 The manufactured pedigree suggested furthermore that Julius was also descended from the royal House of York through Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York's marriage to Isabella of Castile, Duchess of York. Having discovering all this, in 1901 he bought the estate of Broadhembury House in the parish of Broadhembury and installed in it his elder brother William Drewe (d.1938), a wealthy barrister of the Inner Temple, who died there on 25 March 1938. Castle Drogo Castle Drogo, Devon Julius's first cousin was Richard Peek, the rector of Drewsteignton (named after Drogo de Teigne, alleged forefather of the Drewes). Julius stayed on several occasions with his cousin and it must have been here that he conceived the idea of building a castle on the home ground of his ancestor. He found an ideal site, and in 1910 he bought about south and west of the village; by the time of his death he had bought up an estate of 1,500 acres. He then went to Edwin Lutyens, a prominent architect of the time, and asked him to build his castle. According to his son Basil, he did so on the advice of William Hudson, proprietor of Country Life, who was both a patron and a champion of Lutyens. Drewe was now 54 years old, but he still had time, energy and money to create his new family seat. On 4 April 1911, Drewe's 55th birthday, the first foundation stone was laid.The Heritage Trail  Castle Drogo The castle took many years to complete, with the First World War and the economic downturn causing many delays. Castle Drogo was finally completed in 1930, a year before Julius died. Castle Drogo was the last castle to be built in England, and probably the last private house in the country to be built entirely of granite. It is now a Grade I listed building.National Trust  Castle Drogo  What to see & do Marriage and progeny On 26 September 1890 Julius married Frances Richardson (d.1954), younger daughter of Thomas Richardson of Buxton, Derbyshire,Burke's, 1937, p.643 by whom he had five children, three sons and two daughters, as follows: *Adrian Drewe (1891‚Äì1917), eldest son and heir apparent, the seventh 'Drewe' (previously Drew) to be educated at Eton College and Cambridge University. He died during World War I on the front line in 1917 at Ypres, Belgium, alongside about 80 to 100 men from his platoon. His death was a terrible loss to his father who never fully recovered from the shock. *Basil Drewe (1894‚Äì1974), MC, 2nd son, a barrister (Queen's Counsel) of the Middle Temple,Burke's, 1937, p.643 who became his father's heir and in 1931 succeeded him at Castle Drogo. He was awarded an OBE in 1943 for his work with RAF on radar. *Cedric Drewe (1896‚Äì1971), MP, 3rd and youngest son, of Broadhembury House,Burke's, 1937, p.643 who studied at the University of Birmingham between 1916 and 1920. He served as a member of parliament for South Molton in Devon (1924‚Äì29) and for Honiton (1931),Burke's, 1937, p.643 and in 1953 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/issues/39863/supplements/2946/page.pdf He inherited the Broadhembury properties after Julius's death. *Mary Drewe *Frances Drewe. Death and succession Julius Drewe died on 10 November 1931(Kent and Sussex Courier, 13 November 1931,10 ) and was buried at Drewsteignton. His widow Frances and his eldest surviving son Basil Drewe continued to live in the castle. Frances Drewe died in 1954 and Basil was then joined at Drogo by his son Anthony Drewe and his wife. In 1974, Anthony Drewe and his son, Dr Christopher Drewe, gave Castle Drogo, of the surrounding estate, Whiddon Farm, several cottages in Drewsteignton and a financial dowry to the National Trust.

Oil on canvas. National Trust Pauline Jermyn, Lady Trevelyan, circa 1835 by an unknown painter. Oil on metal. National Trust Pauline, Lady Trevelyan (n√©e Paulina Jermyn;Trevelyan, Raleigh (1978); A Pre-Raphaelite Circle, p.7; Chatto & Windus, London; 1st edition. 25 January 1816, Hawkedon, Suffolk13 May 1866, Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland) was an English painter, noted for single-handedly making Wallington Hall in Northumberland a centre of High Victorian cultural life, and for enchanting by her intellect and art John Ruskin, Swinburne, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Christina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, Thomas Carlyle, John Everett Millais, and other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. She was married in May 1835 to Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan, 6th Baronet. Background Paulina (known as Pauline) Jermyn was the eldest child of George Bitton Jermyn (1789‚Äì1857), of Hawkedon Parsonage, who, to ensure the Jermyn surname survived, added it as her second Christian name. Her mother was of Huguenot descendancy. The marriage between artist Pauline Jermyn, the penniless daughter of a clergyman and the rich, teetotal, vegetarian Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan was an unlikely, but not surprisingly successful arrangement‚Äîtheir common interest in geology and art ensured their compatibility and the childless marriage allowed them to channel their creativity to other ends. William Bell Scott said of her, > \\"a true woman, but without vanity, and very likely without the passion of > love.\\" Artistic and other interests Shortly before proposing to Pauline, Walter had made his future wife a gift of a box of fossils. Walter had been described as \\"an intellectual of a dry professional order\\". He was the owner of Wallington estate from 1846 until his death. Besides being a distinguished geologist, he had a great interest in botany and was an authority on farming methods, winning awards for his cattle. His strict views on alcohol led to the dumping of his father‚Äôs wine collection into a nearby lake. Pauline had met him in 1833 at a Cambridge conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She had been schooled in Greek, French, Latin, German, and Italian, and her interests were science, literature and the fine arts. She wrote pieces for the Edinburgh Review and The Scotsman. On her first visit to her husband's family at Wallington, she was inspired by Richard Grainger and John Dobson's redevelopment of nearby Newcastle. Walter may have been a respected scientist, but he was eclipsed by Pauline who had become the focal point for an enormous array of poets, painters and writers. It was during this period that the Central Hall evolved. In earlier days the house was surrounded by an unattractive courtyard, until Ruskin suggested that it be roofed, so that in 1855 this was done under his and John Dobson's supervision. Ruskin, of whom Pauline was a great admirer and confidante,Robert Brownwell (2013) Marriage of Inconvenience is said to have designed the first floor balustrade. William Bell Scott, then an art teacher in Newcastle, with help from Pauline, Ruskin and Arthur Hughes, painted panels in the Hall showing figures and scenes from the history of Northumberland in Pre-Raphaelite style. Pauline was one of the earliest northern English patrons of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (his first having been another northern woman, Ellen Heaton, daughter of a Leeds bookseller, in 1855).Nic Peeters in PRS Review, Vol XXIII, number 1, Spring 2015 at p 48 John and Effie Ruskin Pauline had also been very friendly with Ruskin's wife Effie, but took Ruskin's side when their marriage was annulled in 1854 and subsequently shunned Effie's attempts to maintain contact with her. The previous summer the Ruskins had spent a protracted artistic holiday in the Scottish Highlands with the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Millais and his brother William. En route to Scotland the party stayed with the Trevelyans at Wallington. Pauline noticed that Ruskin and Effie (whose unconsummated marriage was under great strain) spent most of their time apart, but also seems to have been put out by Effie's flirtatious behaviour with John Millais and their lengthy absences together from the house.Brownwell, op.cit. Even so, she was complimentary about Effie's appearance at an evening party at which she wore flowers in her hair, a stylistic trait that subsequently irritated Ruskin, came to the disapproving notice of Florence Nightingale,Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais and inspired a painting by Millais (\\"Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair\\", 1853), whom Effie married in 1855.

It usually focuses on inventory management and ordering decisions in distributed inter-company settings. Channel coordination models may involve multi-echelon inventory theory, multiple decision makers, asymmetric information, as well as recent paradigms of manufacturing, such as mass customization, short product life-cycles, outsourcing and delayed differentiation. The theoretical foundations of the coordination are based chiefly on the contract theory. The problem of channel coordination was first modeled and analyzed by Anantasubramania Kumar in 1992.Kumar, A.: Supply Contracts and Manufacturing Decisions, Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, 1992.  Overview  The decentralized decision making in supply chains leads to a dilemma situation which results in a suboptimal overall performance called double marginalization.Tirole, J.: The Theory of Industrial Organization. MIT Press, 1988. () Recently, partners in permanent supply chains tend to extend the coordination of their decisions in order to improve the performance for all of the participants. Some practical realizations of this approach are Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Quick Response (QR). The theory of channel coordination aims at supporting the performance optimization by developing arrangements for aligning the different objectives of the partners. These are called coordination mechanisms or schemes, which control the flows of information, materials (or service) and financial assets along the chains. In general, a contracting scheme should consist of the following components:Li, X., Wang, Q.: Coordination Mechanisms of Supply Chain Systems. Invited Review. European Journal of Operational Research, 179(1), pp. 1-16, 2007. * local planning methods which consider the constraints and objectives of the individual partners, * an infrastructure and protocol for information sharing, and * an incentive scheme for aligning the individual interests of the partners. The appropriate planning methods are necessary for optimizing the behavior of the production. The second component should support the information visibility and transparency both within and among the partners and facilitates the realization of real-time enterprises. Finally, the third component should guarantee that the partners act upon to the common goals of the supply chain. The general method for studying coordination consists of two steps. At first, one assumes a central decision maker with complete information who solves the problem. The result is a first-best solution which provides bound on the obtainable system-wide performance objective. In the second step one regards the decentralized problem and designs such a contract protocol that approaches or even achieves the performance of the first-best. A contract is said to coordinate the channel, if thereby the partners' optimal local decisions lead to optimal system-wide performance.Cachon, G.P.: Supply Chain Coordination with Contracts . In de Kok, A.G., Graves, S.C. (eds): Supply Chain Management: Design, Coordination and Cooperation. Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 11, Elsevier, pp. 229-339, 2003. () Channel coordination is achievable in several simple models, but it is more difficult (or even impossible) in more realistic cases and in the practice. Therefore, the aim is often only the achievement of mutual benefit compared to the uncoordinated situation. Another widely studied alternative direction for channel coordination is the application of some negotiation protocols.Stadtler, H.: A Framework for Collaborative Planning and State-of-the-Art. OR Spectrum, 31, pp. 5-30, 2009.Albrecht, M.: Supply Chain Coordination Mechanisms Springer, 2010. (). Such approaches apply iterative solution methods, where the partners exchange proposals and counter-proposals until an agreement is reached. For this reason, this approach is commonly referred to as collaborative planning. The negotiation protocols can be characterized according to the following criteria: * The initial proposal is most frequently generated by the buyer company which is called upstream planning. By contrast, when the initiator is the supplier, it is referred to as downstream planning. In several cases there already exists an initial plan (e.g., using rolling schedules or frame plans). There are also some protocols where the initial plan is generated randomly. * In order to guarantee finite runtime, the maximal number of rounds should be determined. In addition, the protocol should also specify the number of plans offered in each round. When the number of rounds or plans is high, the practical application necessitates fast local planner systems in order to quickly evaluate the proposals and generate counter-proposals. * Generally, the negotiation protocols cannot provide optimality, and they require some special conditions to assure convergence. * The counter-proposals usually define side-payments (compensations) between the companies in order to inspire the partner deviating from its previously proposed plan. An also commonly used instrument for aligning plans of different decision makers is the application of some auction mechanisms. However, ‚Äúauctions are most applicable in pure market interactions at the boundaries of a supply chain but not within a supply chain‚Ä≥, therefore they are usually not considered as channel coordination approaches.  Characteristics of coordination schemes  There are several classifications of channel coordination contracts, but they are not complete, and the considered classes are not disjoint.Tsay, A. A., Nahmias, S., Agrawal, N.: Modeling Supply Chain Contracts: A Review. In: Tayur, S., Ganeshan, R., Magazine, M. (eds.): Quantitative Models for Supply Chain Management. International Series in Operations Research and Management Science, 17, Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 299-336, 1999. () Instead of a complete classification, a set of aspects are enumerated below which generalizes the existing taxonomies by allowing classification along multiple viewpoints.Egri, P.: Coordination in production networks. PhD Thesis, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, Budapest, 2008. =Problem characteristics= Horizon Most of the related models consider either one-period horizon or two-period horizon with forecast update.Sethi, S.P., Yan, H., Zhang, H.: Inventory and Supply Chain Management With Forecast Updates. Springer, 2005. ( ) In the latter, the production can be based on the preliminary forecast with normal production mode or on the updated forecast with emergency production, which means shorter lead-time, but higher cost. Besides, the horizon can consist of multiple periods and it can be even infinite. The practically most widespread approach is the rolling horizon planning, i.e., updating and extending an existing plan in each period. Number of products Almost all contract-based models regard only one product. Some models study the special cases of substitute or complementary products. However, considering more products in the general case is necessary if technological or financial constraints‚Äîlike capacity or budget limits‚Äîexist. Demand characteristic On one hand, the demand can be stochastic (uncertain) or deterministic. On the other hand, it can be considered static (constant over time) or dynamic (e.g., having seasonality). Risk treatment In most of the models the players are regarded to be risk neutral. This means that they intend to maximize their expected profit (or minimize their expected costs). However, some studies regard risk averse players who want to find an acceptable trade-off considering both the expected value and the variance of the profit. Shortage treatment The models differ in their attitude towards stockouts. Most authors consider either backlogs, when the demand must be fulfilled later at the expense of providing lower price or lost sales which also includes some theoretical costs (e.g., loss of goodwill, loss of profit, etc.). Some models include a service level constraint, which limits the occurrence or quantity of expected stockouts. Even the 100% service level can be achieved with additional or emergency production (e.g., overtime, outsourcing) for higher costs. Parameters and variables This viewpoint shows the largest variations in the different models. The main decision variables are quantity-related (production quantity, order quantity, number of options, etc.), but sometimes prices are also decision variables. The parameters can be either constant or stochastic. The most common parameters are related to costs: fixed (ordering or setup) cost, production cost and inventory holding cost. These are optional; many models disregard fixed or inventory holding costs. There exist numerous other parameters: prices for the different contracts, salvage value, shortage penalty, lead-time, etc. Basic model and solution technique Most of the one-period models apply the newsvendor model. On two-period horizon, this is extended with the possibility of two production modes. On a multiple period horizon the base- stock, or in case of deterministic demand the EOQ models are the most widespread. In such cases the optimal solution can be determined with simple algebraic operations. These simple models usually completely disregard technological constraints; however, in real industrial cases resource capacity, inventory or budget constraints may be relevant. This necessitates more complex models, such as LP, MIP, stochastic program, and thus more powerful mathematical programming techniques may be required. As for the optimization criteria, the most usual objectives are the profit maximization or cost minimization, but other alternatives are also conceivable, e.g., throughput time minimization. Considering multiple criteria is not yet prevalent in the coordination literature. =Decentralization characteristics= Number and role of the players The most often studied dilemmas involve the two players and call them customer and supplier (or buyer-seller). There are also extensions of this simple model: the multiple customers with correlated demand and the multiple suppliers with different production parameters. Multi-echelon extensions are also conceivable, however, sparse in the literature. When the coordination is within a supply chain (typically a customer-supplier relation), it is called vertical, otherwise horizontal. An example for the latter is when different suppliers of the same customer coordinate their transportation. Sometimes the roles of the participants are also important. The most frequently considered companies are manufacturers, retailers, distributors or logistic companies. Relation of the players One of the most important characteristics of the coordination is the power relations of the players. The power is influenced by several factors, such as possessed process know-how, number of competitors, ratio in the value creation, access to the market and financial resources. The players can behave in a cooperative or opportunistic way. In the former case, they share a common goal and act like a team, while in the latter situation each player is interested only in its own goals. These two behaviors are usually present in a mixed form, since the opportunistic claims for profitability and growth are sustainable usually only with a certain cooperative attitude. The relation can be temporary or permanent. In the temporary case usually one- or two-period models are applied, or even an auction mechanism. However, the coordination is even more important in permanent relations, where the planning is usually done in a rolling horizon manner. When coordinating a permanent supply relation, one has to consider the learning effect, i.e., players intend to learn each other's private information and behavior. Goal of the coordination The simplest possible coordination is aimed only at aligning the (material) flows within the supply chain in order to gain executable plans and avoid shortages. In a more advanced form of coordination, the partners intend to improve supply chain performance by approaching or even achieving the optimal plan according to some criteria. Generally, a coordinated plan may incur losses for some of the players compared to the uncoordinated situation, which necessitates some kind of side-payment in order to provide a win-win situation. In addition, even some sort of fairness may be required, but it is not only hard to guarantee, but even to define. Most of the coordination approaches requires that the goal should be achieved in an equilibrium in order to exclude the possibility that an opportunistic player deviates from the coordinated plan. Information structure Some papers study the symmetric information case, when all of the players know exactly the same parameters. This approach is very convenient for cost and profit sharing, since all players know the incurring system cost. The asymmetric case, when there is an information gap between the players is more realistic, but poses new challenges. The asymmetry typically concerns either the cost parameters, the capacities or the quantities like the demand forecast. The demand and the forecast are often considered to be qualitative, limited to only two possible values: high and low. In case of stochastic demand, the uncertainty of the forecasts can also be private information. Decision structure The decision making roles of the players depend on the specified decision variables. However, there is a more-or-less general classification in this aspect: forced and voluntary compliance. Under forced compliance the supplier is responsible for satisfying all orders of the customer, therefore it does not have the opportunity to decide about the production quantity. Under voluntary compliance, the supplier decides about the production quantity and it cannot be forced to fill an order. This latter is more complex analytically, but more realistic as well. Even so, several papers assume that the supplier decides about the price and then the customer decides the order quantity. Game theoretic model From the viewpoint of game theory the models can take cooperative or non- cooperative approaches. The cooperative approach studies, how the players form coalitions therefore these models are usually applied on the strategic level of network design. Other typical form of cooperative games involves some bargaining framework‚Äîe.g., the Nash bargaining model‚Äîfor agreeing upon the parameters of the applied contracts. On the other hand, on the operational level, the non-cooperative approach is used. Usually the sequential Stackelberg game model is considered, where one of the players, the leader moves first and then the follower reacts. Both cases‚Äîthe supplier or the customer as the Stackelberg leader‚Äîare widely studied in the literature. In case of information asymmetry, a similar sequential model is used and it is called principal‚Äìagent setting. The study of the long-term supply relationship can also be modeled as a repeated game. To sum up, a collaboration generally consists of a cooperative, followed by a non-cooperative game. However, most researches concentrate only on one of the phases. Involvement of a mediator Some coordination mechanisms require the existence of an independent, trusted third party. If such a mediator exists, the powerful theory of the market mechanism design can be applied for channel coordination. Although at first glance the involvement of a third party seems to be unrealistic, in the area of planning such mediators already exist as application service providers.  Contract types  There are many variants of the contracts, some widespread forms are briefly described below. Besides, there exist several combinations and customized approaches, too. =Two-part tariff= In this case the customer pays not only for the purchased goods, but in addition a fixed amount called franchise fee per order. This is intended to compensate the supplier for his fixed setup cost. =Sales rebate= This contract specifies two prices and a quantity threshold. If the order size is below the threshold, the customer pays the higher price, and if it is above, she pays a lower price for the units above the threshold. =Quantity discount= Under quantity discount contract, the customer pays a wholesale price depending on the order quantity. This resembles to the sales rebate contract, but there is no threshold defined. The mechanism for specifying the contract can be complex. The contract has been applied in many situations, for example, in an international supply chain with fluctuating exchange rates.Scheller-Wolf, A., Tayur, S.: Reducing international risk through quantity contracts. Carnegie Mellon University Graduate School of Industrial Administration Working Paper, 1997. =Capacity options= While advance capacity purchase is popular in the supply chain practice, there are situations where a manufacturer prefers to delay its capacity purchase to have better information about the uncertain demand. =Buyback/return= With these types of contracts the supplier offers that it will buy back the remaining obsolete inventory at a discounted price. This supports the sharing of inventory risk between the partners. A variation of this contract is the backup agreement, where the customer gives a preliminary forecast and then makes an order less or equal to the forecasted quantity. If the order is less, it must also pay a proportional penalty for the remaining obsolete inventory. Buyback agreements are widespread in the newspaper, book, CD and fashion industries. =Quantity flexibility= In this case the customer gives a preliminary forecast and then it can give fixed order in an interval around the forecast. Such contracts are widespread in several markets, e.g., among the suppliers of the European automotive industry. =Revenue sharing= With revenue sharing the customer pays not only for the purchased goods, but also shares a given percentage of her revenue with the supplier. This contract is successfully used in video cassette rental and movie exhibition fields. It can be proved, that the optimal revenue sharing and buyback contracts are equivalent, i.e., they generate the same profits for the partners. =Options= The option contracts are originated from the product and stock exchange. With an option contract, the customer can give fixed orders in advance, as well as buy rights to purchase more (call option) or return (put option) products later. The options can be bought at a predefined option price and executed at the execution price. This approach is a generalization of some previous contract types. =VMI contract= This contract can be used when the buyer does not order, only communicates the forecasts and consumes from the inventory filled by the supplier. The VMI contract specifies that not only the consumed goods should be paid, but also the forecast imprecision, i.e., the difference between the estimated and realized demand. In this way, the buyer is inspired to increase the forecast quality, and the risk of market uncertainty is shared between the partners.

In August 2009 he committed suicide while incarcerated, having been criminally charged with conspiring violence against prominent media figures in Israel.  Biography  David Goldenberg, later Dudu Topaz, was born in Haifa, in then British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) to Lilly and Eliyahu Goldenberg. His father was a radio announcer, actor and director. After his army service, Topaz studied acting in London. Upon his return, he performed with the Haifa Theatre and appeared in entertainment shows around the country. Topaz was married two times and had three sons.  Entertainment career  Topaz with radio producer Rachel Haramati at Kol Israel radio, Tel Aviv (1984) In the 1970s, he took part in an Israeli radio show called \\"◊ú◊¶◊ï◊ü ◊†◊ï◊§◊ú ◊¢◊ú ◊ú◊¶◊ï◊ü\\" (loosely:\\"A pranker falls for a prank\\"). His first job in television was as an English teacher in the Israeli Educational Television. In the early eighties Topaz began to direct television game shows in Channel 1. The most successful of those was the game show \\"Play It\\" (◊©◊ó◊ß ◊ê◊ï◊™◊î). Topaz was a television host in the Israeli public TV Channel 1 in the eighties and early nineties, as well as running some successful sketch comedy shows on stage. In the nineties he was the host of popular show \\"Rashut Habidur\\" (The Entertainment Authority), later renamed \\"Ha'Rishon Ba'Bidur\\" (The First at entertainment), that aired for 11 seasons between 1994-2004 on Channel 2 commercial channel, and is one of the highest rated shows ever aired on commercial TV in Israel. After the show ended, Topaz hosted several other shows on other channels, but in May 2007 he announced that he would no longer host TV shows, but would pursue other careers such as acting and documentary film making. Controversy In 1981, Topaz gained notoriety from comments he made during an Israeli Labor Party political rally in Tel Aviv's Malchei Yisrael Square (later renamed Rabin Square) when he said: \\"It's a pleasure to see the crowd here, and it's a pleasure to see that there are no chahchahim (derogatory slang word alluding to Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern background) who ruin election gatherings. The Likud's chachchahim are at Metzudat Ze'ev.\\" (Likud party headquarters) Criminal charges and suicide  Dudu Topaz's grave, inscribed David Goldenberg, in the \\"Yarkon\\" cemetery. In May 2009, Topaz was arrested on suspicion of ordering, organizing and paying for a series of attacks on top-level TV executives Avi Nir and Shira Margalit and showbiz agent Boaz Ben-Zion. The three were beaten by assailants and sustained serious injuries. Topaz was also accused of planning attacks against television figures Zvika Hadar, Erez Tal, and Avri Gilad, Israel Hayom editor- in-chief Amos Regev, his ex-wife Roni Chen, and her husband Haim Zenati, as well as a second assault against Ben-Zion after judging that the first had not been severe enough. Topaz allegedly went on this revenge spree because his show was taken off the air, and because he was rejected by rival channels and newspapers for which he offered to write guest columns. On June 2, 2009, it was reported that Topaz had confessed to having ordered the assaults. Topaz was later also indicted for drug possession, due to allegations that for the previous three years, Topaz had purchased cocaine from Ofir Sasportas, one of the other suspects in the case. He attempted suicide in his prison cell at the Abu Kabir Detention Center in Tel Aviv on July 3, 2009, after taking an overdose of insulin, used to control his diabetes. He was briefly hospitalized. A second suicide attempt on August 20, 2009, was successful, and at approximately 7:00 AM Topaz was found by a warden hanging in a shower (the only place without video surveillance) in the Nitzan Detention Center in Ramla. He apparently used the cord of an electric kettle to hang himself. He was buried in the Yarkon Cemetery in a funeral that hundreds of people attended. In 2012 several men who Topaz hired to carry out the assaults were convicted or reached plea bargains.

He was appointed Bishop of Aughrim by Saint Patrick; the site of his church is now believed to be at Foats or Levallynearl townland in the parish. The adjoining parish of Clontuskert contains the townlands of Crossconnell More and Crossconnell Beg, which commemorate his name. Aughrim parish is bordered on the north by the parish of Kilgerrill, and there is a tradition concerning a dispute between Connell and Saint Kerrill, though this tradition is believed to have its roots in a dispute between the parishes as much as a thousand years later. According to Joseph Mannion: \\"... it is clear that St Kerrill and St Connell were contemporaries of St Patrick and as such they belonged to the fifth century. Both were disciples of his who were raised to the episcopate and placed over churches by him. Their respective ecclesiastical territories are likely to have bordered each other at the Ballinure river which formed part of the southern boundary of Sodhan. Under these circumstances one cannot rule out the possibility of conflict arising over disputed areas of jurisdiction which would have given rise to the legendary disagreement between these two fifth-century evangelists.\\" In the life of Saint Attracta it is told that she \\"approached her brother, St Connell, seeking permission to erect a nunnery close to his own foundation. He prevailed upon St. Dachonna (Conainne) to request his sister not to build in the area.

She was the first woman to hold an office in the Arizona Territorial government and her personal collection of photographs and artifacts served as the starting collection for a history museum which bears her name. Background Sharlot Hall's 1927 Durant Star Touring Car on exhibit in the Sharlot Hall Museum.The Sharlot M. Hall Building which also served as her residence. Hall was born to James Polk Knox and Adeline Susannah Boblett Hall in Lincoln County, Kansas on October 27, 1870. In November 1881, her family followed the Santa Fe Trail to Arizona Territory, moving to the Orchard Ranch on the Lynx Creek 20 miles south of Prescott. During the trip, near Dodge City, she was thrown from her horse and suffered an injury to her back or hip. The pain of the injury would remain with her the rest of her life.Brown p. 39 Hall was educated in public schools, first near the present location of Dewey, Arizona and later in Prescott. At an early age, Hall demonstrated an interest and talent in poetry. Upon graduation she went to Los Angeles to attend the Cumnock School Of Expression. In 1921 Hall received an honorary Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Arizona. At the age of 20, Hall sold her first article to a children's magazine for US$4.00. By age 22 she was working as a journalist, poet, and essayist. Hall became a regular contributor to Charles Lummis' magazine Land of Sunshine and in 1901, when two other poets were unable to complete their deadline, she wrote the poem which announced the magazine's new name of Out West.Brown p. 40 In 1906, Hall was promoted to associate editor for the magazine. In 1905, when legislation to admit Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory as a single combined state was proposed in the U.S. Congress, Hall responded by writing the poem Arizona.Brown p. 41 The poem, which mocked the proposal and made the case for Arizona's independent statehood, was published in several publications and a copy of the poem was given to every member of Congress. In 1909, Hall was appointed Territorial Historian by Governor Sloan. This was followed the next year with the release of Cactus and pine: songs of the Southwest, her first compilation. In 1911, Hall made a trip to the Arizona Strip in an effort to raise awareness of the area's potential among Arizona residents and prevent Utah from obtaining the region as Nevada had obtained Pah-Ute County in 1866.Brown p. 42-3 In 1912 she resigned as Territorial Historian and returned to her family ranch to care for her parents. Hall returned to the public view in 1923 with the release of an expanded version of Cactus and pine containing a selection of additional poems.Brown p. 44 This was followed by her selection as a presidential elector, voting for Calvin Coolidge, in 1925. Hall wore a custom dress made of copper for the balloting ceremony. She also used her trip to Washington D.C. to visit a variety of museums and learn about their management. Following the death of her father, Hall acquired the cabin which had served as the \\"Governor's mansion\\" for Arizona Territory's first governors. In addition to her living quarters, she used the building to house her collection of artifacts related to Arizona pioneers and pre-historic Yavapai county. This move was followed, in 1928, with her founding of the Prescott Historical Society. The same year she opened what she called the Old Governor's Mansion Museum, now known as the Sharlot Hall Museum.Brown p. 45 Over the following years, Hall oversaw the expansion of her museum through the acquisition of a variety of additional historical buildings. She was also a popular speaker, giving talks on local history and folklore to schools and clubs throughout the state. Hall died on April 9, 1943 and was buried in a family plot in Prescott's Pioneer Cemetery. Two years after her death, the Prescott Historical Society changed their name to the Sharlot Hall Historical Society. Additionally, Hall was among the first to be inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame. In 1984, the Sharlot Hall Award was established and is awarded annually to \\"an Arizona woman who has made a valuable contribution to the understanding and awareness of Arizona and its history.\\" Bibliography *Cactus and pine: Songs of the Southwest (1910, 1923) *Poems of a Ranch Woman' Notes References * External links *Who was Sharlot M.

It is a cannabis concentrate containing many of its resins and terpenes ‚Äì in particular, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids. There are various extraction methods, most involving a solvent, such as butane or ethanol. Hash oil is usually consumed by smoking, vaporizing or eating. Hash oil may be sold in cartridges used with pen vaporizers. Preparations of hash oil may be solid or colloidal depending on both production method and temperature and are usually identified by their appearance or characteristics. Color most commonly ranges from transparent golden or light brown, to tan or black. Cannabis retailers in California have reported about 40% of their sales are from cannabis oils. Hash oil is an extracted cannabis product that may use any part of the plant, with minimal or no residual solvent. It is generally thought to be indistinct from traditional hashish, according to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV), as it is \\"the separated resin, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant\\".  Composition  The tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of hash oil varies tremendously, since the manufacturers use a varying assortment of marijuana plants and preparation techniques. Dealers sometimes cut hash oils with other oils. Following an outbreak of vaping related pulmonary illnesses and deaths in 2019 NBC News conducted tests on different THC vape cartridges and found cartridges containing up to 30% Vitamin E acetate and trace amounts of fungicides and pesticides that may be harmful.Conor Ferguson, Cynthia McFadden, Shanshan Dong and Rich Schapiro \\"Tests show bootleg marijuana vapes tainted with hydrogen cyanide\\" , Sept. 27, 2019 Hash oil seized in the 1970s had a THC content ranging from 10% to 30%. The oil available on the U.S. West Coast in 1974 averaged about 15% THC. Samples seized across the United States by the Drug Enforcement Administration over an 18-year period (1980‚Äì1997) showed that THC content in hashish and hashish oil averaging 12.9% and 17.4%, respectively, did not show an increase over time. The highest THC concentrations measured were 52.9% in hashish and 47.0% in hash oil. Hash oils in use in the 2010s had THC concentrations as high as 90% and other products achieving higher concentrations The following compounds were found in naphtha extracts of Bedrocan Dutch medical cannabis: * Cannabinoids: THC (~ 30%) and THCA (~ 60%). * Monoterpenes (~ 5%): Œ≤-pinene, myrcene, Œ≤-phellandrene, cis-ocimene, terpinolene, and terpineol. * Sesquiterpenes (~ 5%): Œ≤-caryophyllene, humulene, Œ¥-guaiene, Œ≥-cadinene, eudesma-3,7(11)-diene, and elemene. The form of the extract varies depending on the extraction process used; it may be liquid, a clear amber solid (called ‚Äúshatter\\"), a sticky semisolid substance (called \\"wax\\"), or a brittle honeycombed solid (called \\"honeycomb wax\\"). History The hash oils made in the nineteenth century were made from hand collected hashish called charas and kief. The term hash oilWalton, Robert P., Pharmaceutical and Chemical Considerations, Marihuana, J. B. Lippincott Company, 1938 tincture p178, hashish oil p159 was hashish that had been dissolved or infused into a vegetable oil for use in preparing foods for oral administration. Efforts to isolate the active ingredient in cannabis were well documented in the nineteenth century, and cannabis extracts and tinctures of cannabis were included in the British Pharmacopoeia and the Pharmacopoeia of the United States. These solvent extracts were termed cannabin (1845), cannabindon, cannabinine, crude cannabinol and cannabinol. So called \\"butane honey oil\\" was available briefly in the 1970s. This product was made in Kabul, Afghanistan, and smuggled into the United States by The Brotherhood of Eternal Love. Production is thought to have ceased when the facility was destroyed in an explosion. Traditional ice-water separated hashish production utilizes water and filter bags to separate plant material from resin, though this method still leaves much residual plant matter and is therefore poorly suited for full vaporization. Gold described the use of alcohol and activated charcoal in honey oil production by 1989, and Michael Starks further detailed procedures and various solvents by 1990. Large cannabis vaporizers gained popularity in the twentieth century for their ability to vaporize the cannabinoids in cannabis and extracts without burning plant material, using temperature controlled vaporization. Colorado and Washington began licensing hash oil extraction operations in 2014. Small portable vape pens saw a dramatic increase in popularity in 2017.  Use  Dabbing hash oil. The clear quartz bucket has been heated using a torch and the hash rosin placed within (seen melted as the small amber puddle). The glass cap (upper left of frame) is placed on top and creates a low pressure zone in the bucket, allowing the material to vaporize at a lower temperature than the ambient atmosphere. The vapor is then directed through a water pipe to further cool before inhalation. Full extract oil in an oral syringe. Hash oil is consumed usually by ingestion, smoking or vaporization. =Dabbing= Smoking or vaporizing hash oil is known colloquially as \\"dabbing\\", from the English verb to daub (Dutch dabben, French dauber), \\"to smear with something adhesive\\". Dabbing devices include special kinds of water pipes (\\"oil rigs\\"), vaporizers and vape pens similar in design to electronic cigarettes. Oil rigs include a glass water pipe and a quartz bucket which is often covered with a bubble or directional cap to direct the airflow and disperse the oil amongst the hot areas of the quartz \\"nail\\". The pipe is often heated with a butane blowtorch rather than a cigarette lighter. The oil can also be sold in prefilled atomizer cartridges. The cartridge is used by connecting it to a battery and inhaling the vaporized oil from the cartridge's mouthpiece.  Production  = Solvent- derived/hydrocarbon extracts: = Hash oil is produced by solvent extraction (maceration, infusion or percolation) of marijuana or hashish. After filtering and evaporating the solvent, a sticky resinous liquid with a strong herbal odor (remarkably different from the peculiar odor of hemp) remains. Fresh, undried plant material is less suited for hash oil production, because much THC and CBD will be present in their carboxylic acid forms (THCA and CBDA), which may not be highly soluble in some solvents. The acids are decarboxylated during drying and heating (smoking). A wide variety of solvents can be used for extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and olive oil. Currently, resinoids are often obtained by extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide. The alcohols extract undesirable water-soluble substances such as chlorophyll and sugars (which can be removed later by washing with water). Non-polar solvents such as benzene, chloroform and petroleum ether will not extract the water-soluble constituents of marijuana or hashish while still producing hash oil. In general, non-polar cannabis extracts taste much better than polar extracts. Alkali washing further improves the odor and taste. Hash oil produced using a hydrocarbon like butane in California, referred to as shatter, due to its very thick and glass-like consistency The oil may be further refined by 1) alkali washing, or removing the heavy aromatic carboxylic acids with antibiotic properties, which may cause heartburn, gallbladder and pancreas irritation, and resistance to hemp antibiotics; 2) conversion of CBD to THC. Process 1) consists of dissolving the oil in a non- polar solvent such as petroleum ether, repeatedly washing (saponifying) with a base such as sodium carbonate solution until the yellow residue disappears from the watery phase, decanting, and washing with water to remove the base and the saponified components (and evaporating the solvents). This process reduces the oil yield, but the resulting oil is less acidic, more easily digestible and much more potent (almost pure THC). Process 2) consists of dissolving the oil in a suitable solvent such as absolute ethanol containing 0.05% hydrochloric acid, and boiling the mixture for 2 hours. One pound of marijuana yields from 1/5 to 1/10 of a pound of hash oil. The oil may retain considerable residual solvent: oil extracted with longer-chain volatile hydrocarbons (such as naphtha) is less viscous (thinner) than oil extracted with short-chain hydrocarbons (such as butane). Colored impurities from the oil can be removed by adding activated charcoal to about one third to one half the weight or volume of the solvent containing the dissolved oil, mixing well, filtering, and evaporating the solvent. When decolorizing fatty oils, oil retention can be up to 50 wt % on bleaching earths and nearly 100 wt % on activated charcoal. The many different textures/types of hydrocarbon extracts include : * shatter (solid, breaks easily, glass like oil) * pull and snap (solid, bendable, but still breakable, taffy-like oil) * diamonds/live resin (rock hard THCA isolated diamonds drenched in terpene sauce) * crumble (solid oil that will break into small crumbs) * budder/wax (soft, pliable, peanut butter-like consistency) = Solventless extracts: Hash rosin = Full spectrum hash rosin that has been placed in a jar for sale. Hash rosin has recently become a top quality, highly prized product in the cannabis market. For dabbing, it is considered to be the cleanest form of concentrating cannabis, as it requires only ice, water (instead of chemical solvents like butane), heat, pressure, and collection tools. Cannabis flower material is washed with ice water, and strained using filters in sequential micron size to isolate intact trichomes and their heads into ice water hash. The microns that are held in highest regards are the 73u and 90u, as this is where the resin heads reside. These are sometimes isolated and sold as one of the highest quality, most expensive cannabis products in the market today, known as \\"full melt\\" because it will dab fine without having to be pressed. \\"Full spectrum\\" hash rosin will normally come from 45u-159u, as smaller and larger particles are likely to be too unrefined or broken stalks of the trichomes. This hash is then pressed at the appropriate temperature and pressure to squeeze the oils out of the hash, and is collected with metal tools and parchment paper. Just like hydrocarbon extraction, the quality of the final product depends greatly on the quality of the starting material. This is emphasized even more so with hash rosin due to its lower yield percentages compared to solvent-derived concentrates (.3-8% rosin vs 10-20% hydrocarbon). Hash rosin produces often touch on how growing cannabis for hash production is different than growing for flower production, as some strains will be deceptive with their looks regarding yields. Legality In Canada, hash oil ‚Äì defined as a chemically concentrated extract having up to 90% THC potency ‚Äì was approved for commerce in October 2018. In the United States, regulations specifically for hash oil have not been issued as of 2019, but hemp seed oil ‚Äì along with hulled hemp seeds and hemp seed protein ‚Äì were approved as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in December 2018, indicating that \\"these products can be legally marketed in human foods for these uses without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make disease treatment claims\\". Ingredient in vape liquids =Adulterated products= Vitamin E acetate On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. On November 8, 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. The CDC's findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of 29 patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury, which provided direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in all the 29 lung fluid samples tested. Research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning. \\"Vitamin E oil might be in 60-70% of street carts, insiders say.\\". Synthetic cannabinoids Counterfeit THC oil has been detected to contain synthetic cannabinoids. Several school kids in Greater Manchester collapsed after vaping Spice mis-sold as 'natural cannabis'.  Safety  =Use= Hash oil being purged of excess butane which forms bubbles as the solvent evaporates the health effects of using hash oil were poorly documented. Cannabis extracts have less plant matter and create less harmful smoke. However, trace amounts of impurities are not generally regarded as safe (GRAS). In 2019 following an outbreak of illnesses additives added to vape pen mixtures were found to be causing breathing problems, lung damage, and deaths. =Production= Most of the solvents employed vaporize quickly and are flammable, making the extraction process dangerous. Several explosion and fire incidents related to hash oil manufacturing attempts in homes have been reported. Solvents used to extract THC are flammable or combustible and have resulted in explosions, fires, severe injuries, and deaths. = Handling = Butane honey oil The LD50 for THC (Delta 9 Tetrahydrocannabinol) is not precisely known, as there have been no recorded fatalities. Hash oil can contain up to 80% THC, though up to 99% is possible with other methods of extraction. While health issues of the lungs may be exacerbated by use of hash oil, it is not known to cause side effects not already found in other preparations of cannabis. = Storage = When exposed to air, warmth and light (especially without antioxidants), the oil loses its taste and psychoactivity due to aging. Cannabinoid carboxylic acids (THCA, CBDA, and maybe others) have an antibiotic effect on gram- positive bacteria such as (penicillin-resistant) Staphylococcus aureus, but gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli are unaffected.

It has been established through sponsorship from Allan WB Gray, founder of Allan Gray Limited and the co-founder of Allan Gray Orbis Foundation. Centre for Coaching The Centre for Coaching has initiated a partnership with New Ventures West and The Weathervane to develop courses with international accreditation and practices. Coaching to Excellence, Associate Coaching and Professional Coaching are the most prominent courses offered by the Centre. Managing Infrastructure Reform and Regulation The Management Programme in Infrastructure Reform and Regulation (MIR) aims to build capacity to manage reform and regulation of infrastructure sectors throughout Africa and in other emerging economies. MIR works in support of sustainable development and is currently focusing on the electricity and water sectors. The centre conducts research, offers short courses, and provides professional support and policy advocacy. Faculty The GSB has 41 resident faculty members. Many are internationally acclaimed as researchers and teachers. Others are involved in national and regional issues as well as in policy formulation and implementation. The School's core faculty is supplemented by international visiting academics and executives. Kosheek Sewchurran is the current interim director of the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business (UCT GSB). Research The School has identified five inter- disciplinary themes around which it seeks to focus its research. These are: * Governance in emerging economies and the impact on economic development * Culture, diversity and dynamics * Entrepreneurial development and sustainable business * Development, innovation and technology * Infrastructure and regulation. Programmes MBAMba The GSB MBA is one of the oldest management programmes in South Africa and has been producing graduates for almost four decades. The curriculum is international in scope and standard but with a distinctive orientation to the (South) African context. It has a strong practical emphasis and in addition to addressing the functional areas of business, new streams of learning around communication, leadership and entrepreneurship keep it at the cutting edge of professional development. At 11 months, the full-time UCT MBA programme is one of the shortest around and it is known for its intensity. The programme is also available in a modular format to accommodate students who wish to continue working while they pursue their studies. Executive MBA The Executive MBA is not a modular version of the MBA programme. Although the academic qualification is the same, the process of learning and content are different. The Executive MBA is the only programme in South Africa that is targeted at senior and executive managers and leaders. The course uses learning techniques that are designed to develop critical thinking, decision-making abilities and a capacity to function in complex organisational and social environments. Students acquire a deeper understanding of management from an international perspective. Associate in Management(AIM) AIM was launched in 1991 in order to fast-track working black South Africans who, because of the history of apartheid, lacked the formal qualifications they needed to climb the corporate ladder. Although taught at a postgraduate level, the programme does not require applicants to have an undergraduate degree or even a matric certificate, and recognises work experience and aptitude as prior learning. Postgraduate Diploma in Business Administration (PDBA) The PDBA is a management development programme at pre- masters level and can act as a bridging course for students who may not meet the entrance requirements of the MBA programme. Masters in Development Finance The UCT GSB, in partnership with Africagrowth Institute (AGI), is offering an MPhil (Development Finance) which aims to enable students to meet the development needs of the continent. PHD Programme The GSB runs a comprehensive PhD programme to encourage original research at the business school that fits the school's research agenda. Executive Education The department offers a range of short courses that are open to public enrolment. The selection of specialist short courses cover a spectrum of interests, ranging from general management issues to those that are industry-specific, such as electricity regulation. Customised Education The UCT GSB also offers programmes that are customised for corporates, government, NGOs and SETAs. Programmes are modular and accredited national qualifications can be customised to suit a client's specific needs. Corporations with which Executive Education continues to work vary in size, sector, focus and challenge. Examples of those it has worked with include Metropolitan Holdings, ABSA, BHP Billiton, Nestle SA, Johnson & Johnson, South African Breweries, and Standard Bank. Other Initiatives GSB Solution Space The Solution Space is an ecosystem for early-stage start-ups and a research and development platform for corporates. The Solution Space was founded in 2014 at the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business. The university's Vice Chancellors Strategic Award provided initial capital, and founding partner, the MTN Group, provided significant support from 2015.

History In 1903 Frederick Nicholas Charrington, who had disinherited himself from his family's brewing business and become a prominent temperance campaigner in London's East End, purchased an island off the coast of Maldon, Essex called Osea Island. During Mr Charrington's time, the island provided free treatment to those individuals suffering from the ill effects of alcohol and opiate addiction. In return for treatment clients would remain on the island and work the land. The island was eventually requisitioned by the Admiralty and subsequently turned into a top secret torpedo manufacturing base for both World Wars. In 2005, Brendan Quinn, a psychiatric nurse with a diploma in addiction treatment, founded The Causeway Retreat for addiction treatment on Osea island, with business partner Nigel Frieda, a music producer. Although The Causeway Retreat was closed down, the island continues to be used as a non-profit retreat by former servicemen and women suffering from PTSD. News reports of licensing and other problems In March 2010 The Causeway Retreat was reported to be under investigation from the UK health regulator Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates NHS trusts and private clinics. Licensing, staffing, supply of medicines and the role of the charitable arm Changing Lives were listed as areas to be examined. On 29 April 2010, a further report claimed that the Care Quality Commission had ordered the retreat to close, after it had admitted new patients despite a request not to do so pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations that it was treating patients without a licence under the Care Standards Act. The CQC was reported to have asked the retreat to remove its clients and close its doors within a week. It was also reported that some families whose relatives had been treated at the retreat had launched legal action against it. The Causeway Retreat was refused registration on 30 September 2010 by the Care Quality Commission, and Brendan Quinn was suspended as a nurse by the Nursing and Midwifery Council on 20 September 2010. On 19 November 2010 Brendan Quinn's Twenty 7 Management, which had run the Causeway Retreat, pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Magistrate's Court, was fined ¬£8,000 plus ¬£30,000 costs, for running an unlicensed hospital. District Judge David Cooper said the firm's standards \\"would really shame a third world country\\".

R. Christensen (17 December 1906 ‚Äì 27 January 1967) was a Norwegian newspaper editor. He is known for his work in the Norwegian resistance movement, as editor of Verdens Gang and as a historical writer. He also helped shape the Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press. Early life He was born in Solum as a son of merchant Nils Christian Christensen (1872‚Äì1957) and his wife Ellen Kristine Reiersen (1883‚Äì1953). He was a brother of Nils-Reinhardt Christensen. Following miscellaneous education, he was hired in Dagbladet in 1926. In 1933 he married Else Marie √òstvedt (1906‚Äì1982). They lived in Vestre Aker. In 1934 Christensen was hired in the publishing house Aschehoug. He also wrote news analyses for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation radio. Also, Christiansen was a deputy member of the Liberal Party of Norway national board. World War II In 1940, Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany as a part of World War II. Christiansen participated for the Liberal Party in early negotiations with the occupying power, but as Germany seized tighter control in September 1940 Christiansen joined the Norwegian resistance, and acted as a middle man between the Norwegian press and the Home Front. He co-founded the written organ of the Home Front, Bulletinen. A co-founder was Einar Gerhardsen, and editors were Christensen, Olaf Solumsmoen and Olav Larssen. Christensen also wrote news analyses for several illegal newspapers. He was arrested by the Nazi authorities in late February 1941, for \\"spying\\", and sat for three months at M√∏llergata 19 and for five days in Grini concentration camp. While at M√∏llergata 19 he penned the crime novel Telefon til myrdede, issued in 1942. He also continued writing news analyses, which were smuggled out of the prison. Upon release in late May 1942, he continued his work. In 1943 he was arrested for the second time. Via Gjerpen and Larvik he was brought to Grini, and sat there from 19 to 31 August. Later career After the war, some members of the Home Front discussed a restart of the newspaper Tidens Tegn, but this did not go through. Instead a new newspaper with roots in the Home Front was created, with Christensen as editor-in-chief: Verdens Gang. He remained editor-in-chief until his death. From 1953 he co-edited with Oskar Hasselknippe, and he was succeeded by Vegard Sletten. Despite initial hardships, the newspaper grew influent and has been the largest in Norway since 1981. In 1963 it assumed the tabloid format as the first in Norway, reportedly to Christensen's dismay. Christensen also chaired the Norwegian Press Association from 1958 to 1962, and was instrumental in establishing the Rights and Duties of the Editor code in 1953 and for the revision of the Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press in 1956. This was the first revision since the code's inauguration in 1936. He also participated in the non-press sphere after the war; already in 1944 he helped shape the Common Platform (Fellesprogrammet) which was meant to unite political parties in Norway after the war. In May 1945 he supported Paal Berg, head of Hjemmefrontens Ledelse in his endeavors to create a broad, non-partisan coalition. The road was open as the pre-war cabinet Nygaardsvold resigned, but the increasingly popular Communist Party were particularly skeptical to Berg, and the Conservative President of the Storting C. J. Hambro got his way in reconvening the pre-war Parliament of Norway. Berg faced unexpected opposition from this Parliament, and gave up on 20 June. Instead Einar Gerhardsen formed a cabinet, and also won the first free post-war election. Christensen was a board member of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs and the Norwegian News Agency. In addition, he continued his writing of historical books. Notable works included Fra verdenskrig til verdenskrig ('From World War to World War') and Okkupasjons√•r og etterkrigstid ('Occupation Years and Post- war Era'), volumes eight and nine of the series V√•rt folks historie ('Our People's History'), both issued in 1961. He died of a heart attack while on a cruise in 1967, in a hospital in Las Palmas.

Background Shooting in the UK had been criticised by a number of funding groups including UK Sport as well as its athletes for its scattered and disparate governance structure, in addition to the absence of a coherent development ladder for British Target Rifle shooters to progress from grassroots to elite level. As such, UKSport provided funding to study the possibility of merging the three largest governing bodies. This was a complex undertaking as all three organisations had very different governance structures and financial circumstances. Both the NSRA and NRA were cash poor, though the NRA had significant facility assets in its Bisley site. The CPSA was the largest with approximately 15,000 members compared to the ~5,000 members each of the NRA and NSRA. Most notably the CPSA was and remains legally constituted as a private Limited Company whereas the NSRA and NRA are both Companies Limited by Guarantee and hold Charity status, creating significant legal challenges as to how assets and finances would be merged and managed. Immediate reaction amongst shooters to the group was mixed, with some embracing the possibilities that a single, consolidated organisation would bring, whilst others raised practical considerations regarding the implementation and impact of a single coherent body, such as the CPSA's lack of charity status which would have required substantial restructuring to amalgamate into a new body that would be eligible for charity status. Due to poor initial public communications, misinformation was rife with some shooters believing a third party was attempting to usurp the existing bodies, which resulted in angry postings to a number of Internet forums. Resistance remained, even when it was made clear that NATSS was formed of representatives of the existing bodies. Much hostility to the merger proposal arose because the NSRA and NRA are member associations, so could not merge without explicit permission from their memberships at an AGM or EGM. The NATSS steering group had no powers beyond conducting research and the project was essentially a viability study. As the project was funded by UKSport, it was believed by the proponents there was no need to seek permission from members before undertaking the studies. The project was instigated by mutual agreement of the respective executive committees. 31 July 2007 Following the \\"Bisley Forum\\" of 2007, the NATSS steering group was hosted by the CPSA on 31 July 2007, where \\"Performance Matters\\" were appointed as facilitators. Performance Matters claimed extensive experience facilitating similar mergers and restructurings for sports NGBs, but there seems to be little evidence of that available to the members of the NGBs. The involvement of Performance Matters was supported through funding obtained from UKSport and CCPR. It was also announced that there would be a series of regional workshops to consult with stake-holders such as firearms dealers, owners and managers of shooting centres, county association representatives, as well as shooters themselves. John Perry of the CPSA was seconded from his usual duties to work exclusively on the NATSS project as the liaison between the constituent bodies and Performance Matters. The workshops Nine workshops were held around the UK in March and April 2008. An online survey was also made available for those unable to attend the workshops, and to reach the wider shooting community. The survey results were published on 30 April 2008. The survey was taken by 2,601 people, and unaudited reports claim that 54% thought there would be challenges and drawbacks to modernisation, with 91.4% of the opinion that on balance the benefits of modernisation outweighed the drawbacks. It was then claimed that ultimately 87.5% were in favour of a merger, whilst 10% opposed it. There is no substantiation of these figures, which are widely accepted as fanciful at best. Questions have been raised as to the validity of the survey, as the survey permitted participants to skip questions. Although 2601 individuals participated, not all questions were answered 2601 times. For example, the question on whether the respondent favoured a merger was only answered by ~1000 participants, so, only ~35% of the participants explicitly stated support and ~4% stated opposition, with ~61% abstaining from the question entirely. Five strategic priorities were identified from the survey: # Protecting the sport # Repositioning the sport in the media and public perception # Education - target shooting in schools and in the National Curriculum # Widening and increasing membership # Protecting the heritage of the sport The results of the survey were largely validated by the feedback from the workshops, although the workshops naturally allowed more detailed discussion. A summary of the Workshop results was released on Wednesday 4 June 2008, and updates from Performance Matters were made available throughout 2008 and into 2009 2009 Work on NATSS stalled in late 2008 due to a shift in focus by the constituent bodies on attaining ¬£750,000 of grassroots funding from Sport England as part of a \\"whole sport\\" funding bid by NSRA, NRA and CPSA. Following a CPSA Board meeting on 22 July 2009, the CPSA announced on 3 August its intention to withdraw from the process due to slow progress and the end of UKSport funding for Performance Matters. Following the withdrawal of the CPSA, the project was shelved indefinitely. Legacy Whilst NATSS remains shelved, the research and survey work performed in its name continues to be a valuable resource for the constituent groups. Shooting has been very slow to modernise to the internet age, and in the wake of the NATSS project, many issues that members had repeatedly emphasised as requiring action have been taken on board ‚Äì most notably in the areas of communication and public relations, with new websites and mailing lists launched. On 18 October 2010, the NRA launched its own survey soliciting opinions from members and non- members to build on the work it has done since August 2009 and develop its strategy for the future. The groups continue to cooperate on matters of elite sport through British Shooting, and on broader shooting issues via the British Shooting Sports Council.

Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen, also known as Hing Yau Yu Tsuen was a walled village in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon, Hong Kong with a history spanning more than 600 years. It was the last walled village in the urban core of Hong Kong before its resumption for redevelopment by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA), a government agency, in 2016. History Ng Ancestral hall in Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen in 2007. According to a legend, members of the Ng, Chan and Lee Clans followed the fugitive Song Emperor and settled in Kowloon in around 1278. The village was probably established by the Ng, Chan and Lee clans in the mid 14th century.Legislative Council Nga Tsin Wai Village Project, 2007 They built a Tin Hau Temple around 1352 and the fortified village around 1724. Nga Tsin Wai was the head village of the \\"Kowloon League of Seven\\", an inter- village union formed to guard against attacks from the pirates and bandits. Other villages of the League included the nearby Sha Po, Ta Kwu Leng, Shek Kwu Lung, Kak Hang, Tai Hom, Nga Tsin Long, Ma Tau Chung and Ma Tau Wai. The Tin Hau Temple of Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen was the place of worship for the residents of the villages of the League.J.W.

The village occupied an area of approximately 0.4 hectares. There are about 100 village houses separated by three narrow streets and six sidelanes in a rectangular layout. The walled village has a Ng (Âê≥) Clan Hall and a Tin Hau Temple. Resumption On 18 July 2007, the government announced its plans to redevelop Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen.HK Yahoo News In response, the Nga Tsin Wai Village Concern Group was formed and documented conservation efforts on their website. The Urban Renewal Authority (URA), a statutory agency, planned to replace the village with two high-rise towers. Villagers complained that the URA asked them to leave without finding them public housing flats and new homes for their businesses. The villagers also complained that the URA's offer for reduced shop rent following the redevelopment would only last for three years, and rents would subsequently revert to market rates, putting grassroots entrepreneurs (who had previously owned their own shops) out of business. By December 2015 only 15 families remained in the village. The last residents were forced out of the village in late January 2016 under threat of a fine of up to HK$1 million and imprisonment of six months for not complying with the removal order. Villagers attacked the URA for putting profit ahead of heritage. They said that private developers had been eyeing the village for three decades, and only succeeded when the URA stepped in and made use of the Land Resumption Ordinance and Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations. The last two holdouts announced on 25 January that they would leave. They were Kwok Yue-ka, salon owner, and an elderly business owner named Lee who said he did not want to risk the safety of those who stayed to support him. The URA partnered with Cheung Kong Property Holdings to redevelop the site. The village will be replaced with two towers housing 750 flats, plus \\"some conservation elements\\", resulting from archaeological finds in 2018, are to be featured.

In 2018, she and Petter Eide from the Socialist Left Party, demonstrated at Eidsvolls plass during the Norwegian reception of Li Zhanshu, the chairman of the National People's Congress's Standing Committee. Melby and Eide were asked to take off their yellow T-shirts with the inscription \\"freedom\\" in Norwegian and Mandarin before they could enter the Storting. Melby stated afterwards that it was \\"at best naive of the Storting to accept that our democratic rules are deceived by a manipulative system, at worst we have allowed ourselves to be dictated, and that is even worse\\". Following Trine Skei Grande‚Äôs decision to resign as minister and party leader in March 2020, Melby was asked by Grande personally if she wanted to succeed her as minister.

In August 2020, she announced her intention to stand for the Liberal leadership following Grande‚Äôs resignation. She became the third person after Sveinung Rotevatn and Abid Raja to announce their run for the leadership.

Established in 2007 with funding of ¬£100 million, it provided grants and loans until 2011, with a further ¬£19 million proposed in 2012. From June 2009, the fund was managed on behalf of the Department for Health by a consortium consisting of Futurebuilders England and Partnerships UK. Context The Government's vision for reform in health and social care services includes developing a provider market that is increasingly plural and diverse. This sets the context for new kinds of organizations to emerge, including social enterprises which provide more choices for patients and a higher quality, more responsive service. The White Paper, 'Our Health, Our Care, Our Say' (January 2006) identified social enterprises as key means of delivering high quality health and social care services tailored to the needs of communities. It included a commitment to establish a SEIF from April 2007 to: * provide advice to social entrepreneurs who want to develop new models to deliver health and social care services; * provide increased choice and more integrated services; * ensure services become more personalised to the needs of the individual; * address the problems of start up; * address current barriers to entry around access to finance; and * address risks and skills to develop viable business models. Most recently the High Quality Care For All: NHS Next Stage Review Final Report and the Primary and Community Care Strategy set out a vision for this change, stating the need to empower staff and give patients more choice. The NHS Next Stage Review includes a number of recommendations that present huge opportunities for new and existing social enterprises. Significant recommendations include: * the ability to create new social enterprises to deliver primary and community services; * giving NHS staff the 'right to request' from their PCT to enable them to set up a social enterprise; and * to allow NHS staff to explore setting up a social enterprise if they believe that this could provide them with independence, flexibility and responsiveness to innovate and improve services and outcomes for patients. What the fund provides The SEIF provides investment to new and existing social enterprises that are delivering or planning to bid for health and social care services contracts. The investments take the forms of loans, grants and professional support.

Tu'ipelehake is a traditional very high-ranking Tongan title. He was the 5th Tu'ipelehake.  Biography  Tu'i Pelehake attended Newington College, Sydney, (1941‚Äì1942)Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp201 and Gatton Agricultural College, Queensland, Australia. Fatafehi married Melenaite Tupoumoheofo Veikune (13 November 1924 ‚Äì 16 March 1993) on the same day as his older brother, the Crown Prince (in that time still called Tupoutoa-Tungƒ´) married Halaevalu Mataaho Ahomee. That was the famous double royal wedding (taane mƒÅhanga) of 10 June 1947. He received the title Tui Pelehake (Fatafehi) from his mother (Queen Salote) in 1944, and he also received the runner up highest title of Tonga of Tui Faleua (king of the second house). From a non-traditional side, he was conferred an honorary CBE. He inherited from his mother an artistic side; he was a well-known poet and composer. His career was with his brother in the government. His first assignment was as governor of Vava ªu (1949‚Äì1952), later of Ha ªapai (1952‚Äì1953), next he held various ministerial portfolios in cabinet, until he took over as Prime Minister of Tonga when his brother had to vacate the post on becoming king in 1965. He remained in this post until he had to withdraw in 1991 because of serious health problems. His last years were spent in a wheelchair on a life support system. He kept the both titles of Tui Pelehake and Tui Faleua for so many years, that they became synonymous with him. But after his death, only the former was conferred to his son, while the latter returned to the king. He died on 10 April 1999 in Auckland after a long illness.

On 10 May the German armed forces (Wehrmacht) began their invasion of Western Europe. By 3 June, the British Army had withdrawn from Dunkirk and the continent in Operation Dynamo, the Netherlands and Belgium had surrendered and most of the formations of the French Army were disbanded or destroyed. To complete the defeat of France, the Germans undertook a second phase operation, Fall Rot (Case Red), to conquer the remaining regions. In order to do this, air supremacy was required. The Luftwaffe was ordered to destroy the French Air Forces, while still providing support to the German Army. For the operation, the Germans committed five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The operation was launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French of the impending attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). However, the plight of the French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France. Background After the declaration of war on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France, in the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland, nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front named the Phoney War. The only military action was the French Army's Saar Offensive which was terminated in controversial circumstances. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe High Command) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) turned their attentions to Western Europe.Healy 2007, pp. 3‚Äì5. The Western Allies had surrendered the initiative and the Germans would take the offensive in 1940. Several plans were toyed with by the German General Staff. General Franz Halder, the chief of staff of the Army, presented the first plan for Fall Gelb (\\"Case Yellow\\") on 19 October 1939. The plan's German code was Aufmarschanweisung N¬∞1, Fall Gelb, or \\"Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow\\".Healy 2007, pp. 5‚Äì8. The operation was a limited operation in which Luxembourg and the Low Countries were to be conquered in order to provide a base for further operations against France at a later date and amounted to a less ambitious re-run of the infamous Schlieffen Plan which failed during the First World War in 1914.Bond 1990, p. 42. It was rejected by Adolf Hitler and at the turn of the year, Heinz Guderian's chief of staff, Erich von Manstein secured Hitler's attention with a modified version. An ambitious thrust through the Ardennes was suggested by von Manstein. This main attack would use up the majority of the motorised and tank divisions (Panzer Divisions) in a drive to the English Channel. A diversion operation in Belgium and the Netherlands would precede this thrust, to lure the Allied Armies, including the British Expeditionary Force, into a trap.Healy 2007, pp. 8‚Äì11.Bond 1990, pp. 43‚Äì44. Launched on 10 May 1940, the revised version of Unternehmen Gelb (Operation Yellow), also known as the Manstein Plan, succeeded. However, the British Army escaped during the Battle of Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were destroyed in the encirclement. This left just second rate French units to combat the entire German Army. The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase. The Luftwaffe's participation was particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the German Army to carry out Operation Yellow. By early June the Dunkirk siege was over, and on 3 June, the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot (Case Red). For this to be as successful, air superiority would be required first, as it had been during Operation Yellow.Hooton 2007, pp. 47‚Äì48, p. 77. Luftwaffe plans Hugo Sperrle, commander of Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3) Hugo Sperrle had long planned attacks upon Paris and on 22 May he ordered Fliegerkorps II (Air Corps II) and Fliegerkorps V (Air Corps V) with Kampfgeschwader 77 (Bomber Wing 77) and Generaloberst (General Colonel) Ulrich Grauert's I Fliegerdivision, III./Kampfgeschwader 28 (Bomber Wing 28) to bomb Paris. Bad weather prevented the operation. Determined to continue with his plans, Sperrle ordered Otto Hoffmann von Waldau and Helmuth von Hoffman, Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) of III./KG 28,de Zeng et al Vol. 1, 2007, p. 114. to plan an operation named Paula the following day, on 23 May 1940.Hooton 2007, p. 82. The operation was broad in its scope. As well as eliminating French airfields and aircraft factories around Paris,Weal 2000, p. 35. in von Waldau's words, the bombing was to \\"achieve a desirable influence on the morale of the capital\\".Hooton 1994, p. 263. German reconnaissance aircraft reported 1,244 aircraft on airfields in and around Paris, including 550‚Äì650 single engine aircraft.Hooton 2007, p. 81. This French air power was to be destroyed along with the aviation factories in the area. French anti aircraft artillery (AAA) defences were mapped from tactical to operational level, and intelligence of French ground defences was therefore good.Hooton 2007, pp. 82‚Äì83. The operation was due to be carried out on 30 May, but again, bad weather prevented it.Hooton 2007, p. 82. The operation was compromised by poor staff work and excessive confidence in the \\"invulnerable\\" Enigma machine. The British intelligence, namely Ultra, who had been reading the German codes, forewarned the French. On 30 May they intercepted a message sent by Grauert discussing the arrangements he was making for his Corps.Hooton 2007, p. 84. Adding to this leak, the units involved received incomplete orders for the assault. Oberst Johann-Volkmar Fisser, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of KG 77 complained about this. He asked the Headquarters of VIII Fliegerkorps, only to be told that the target was \\"Paris\\".Hooton 2007, p. 84. Sperrle responded to his request by removing KG 77 from the order of battle. The British intercepted Frisser's request to VIII Fliegerkorps, and passed it to the French. The French had intercepted similar messages and in response they doubled their aircraft strength to 120 fighters. Forces involved =German= Units from both Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 1 and 2) were made available for the operation. Kampfgeschwader (Bomber Wings) and Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) with aircraft from Lehrgeschwader 1, (LG 1), Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1), Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3), Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4), Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54), Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) and Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76), escorted by fighter aircraft from Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2), Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26), Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27), Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53), Zerst√∂rergeschwader 2 (ZG 2) and Zerst√∂rergeschwader 76 (ZG 76) were to carry out the attack.Hooton 1994, pp. 263‚Äì264. KG 1, ZG 76 and LG 1 were under the command of I. Fliegerkorps. ZG 2, KG 3 and II./KG 2 were under the command of II. Fliegerkorps. and III./KG 54 were under IV. Fliegerkorps. served under V. Fliegerkorps. and JG 26 were under the command of the IX. Fliegerdivision. JG 2 and JG 27 were under the command of VIII. Fliegerkorps. Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer 3 lent JG 53 for the operation.Hooton 2007, pp. 78‚Äì79. Stab. and I./KG 2 moved to Trier-Euren for the attack. I./KG 2 operated from Wengerohr, and III./KG 2 was to operate from Kirchenburg.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, pp. 23‚Äì31. Stab. operated from Schwabisch. I., II., III./KG 55 operated from Reims, Heilbronn and Eutingen respectively.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, pp. 193‚Äì201. KG 3's, I., II., and III., Gruppe were based at Aschaffenburg, Schweinfurt and W√ºrzburg. These units were based at unknown French bases by 3 June.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, pp. 36‚Äì48. KG 4 and its units were based at G√ºtersloh, Fassberg and Delmenhorst. It is likely that some of KG 3's units moved to bases near Lille for the attack.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, pp. 49‚Äì60. KG 1's I., II., III., Gruppe were based at Giessen, Kirtorf and Ettinghausen.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, pp. 13‚Äì22. It likely that some of these units also moved to captured French airfields by 3 June. It is possible they were based at Rosi√®res-en-Santerre.Hooton 2007, p. 78. Only I./KG 54 took part in the raid from the Geschwader (Wing). was probably located in somewhere in northern France on 3 June. It was originally based at K√∂ln-Ostheim.de Zeng et al Vol 1 2007, p. 188. The fighter units were based at the following airfields: Abbeville (ZG 76); Darmstadt, Neufch√¢teau, Freiburg (ZG 2); Le Touquet, La Capelle, √âtaples (JG 26); Couvron, Oulchy-le- Ch√¢teau, (JG 2); Guise (JG 27); √âpernay, Douzy, Charleville-M√©zi√®res, La Selve (JG 53).Hooton 2007, p. 78‚Äì79. KG 2 put up 99 bombers for the raid and KG 55 committed 66 bombers from their three Gruppen.Hooton 2007, pp. 83‚Äì84. Altogether the Luftwaffe fielded 640 bombers and 460 fighters.Mackay 2003, pp. 62‚Äì63. =French= Tasked with the defence of the greater Paris area was the Zone d'Op√©rations A√©riennes Nord or Z.O.A.N (Northern Zone of Air Operations). Groupe de Chasse I/145 (Polish) armed with Caudron C.714 fighters were based at Dreux. G.C. I/1 with Bloch MB.152s were based at Chantilly-Les Aigles. G.C. II/1 Bloch 152s were deployed to Br√©tigny-sur-Orge airfield. G.C. II/10 Bloch 152s were located at Bernay-en-Ponthieu, while G.C. III/10 Bloch 152s were based at Deauville. More fighter units operating the Dewoitine D.520 are also listed on the order of battle: G.C. I/3 at Meaux‚ÄìEsbly, G.C. II/3 at La Fert√©- sur-Chiers‚ÄìGaucher, G.C. III/3 with the D.520 and Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 at Illiers-l'√âv√™que. Further units were located along the line. G.C. I/4 with Curtiss H-75s at √âvreux-Fauville, G.C. II/4 Curtiss H-75 at Orconte, G.C. I/6 Morane 406s at Lognes-√âmerainville, G.C. III/7 (Morane 406s) at Coulommiers, G.C. I/8 Bloch 152s at Claye-Souilly, and G.C. II/9 Bloch 152s at Connantre. These units were supported by night fighter units, (Groupement de Chasse de Nuit, Night Hunting Group), E.C.M.J. 1/16, E.C.N. 1/13, 2/13, 3/13 and 4/13 equipped with the Potez 631. All in all, these groups totalled 240 aircraft.Jackson 1974, p. 80.French Air Force order of battle, 5 June 1940. Only 120 fighters were made available to counter German attacks. The battle On 3 June, the French units were warned an hour before the German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the scramble signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground. In the end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of these machines was piloted by Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war, was brought down on this date, although it is not clear if KG 51 was involved in Paula. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain. At least one source does not place KG 51 on the order of battle.Jackson 1974, p. 81. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and marshalling yard centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours. Most of the German bombers had passed over and had an altitude advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.Mackay 2003, p. 63. Aftermath The Germans believed they had struck a mortal blow against the ALA. German post-operation analysis indicated a resounding success. It suggested a long list of wrecked French factories and destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the air. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 75 French aircraft in the air and 400 on the ground. Such was the perceived success, the Luftwaffe concentrated against ports on the northern French coast thereafter. The damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe was far less than the Germans thought. Only 20 French aircraft (16 of them fighters) were destroyed on the ground and 15 of their fighters were shot down in aerial combat, a loss rate of 19 percent, suggesting German over claiming of over 4:1 in the air and 16:1 on the ground. Six of the sixteen airfields hit reported serious damage, while fifteen factories reported slight damage. French casualties on the ground were heavy, including 254 dead and 652 injured.Hooton 1994, p. 264. The French shot down 10 German aircraft, including four bombers. They claimed 16, suggesting mutual over claiming. A further 21 vehicles were destroyed. All the French airfields were back in operation 48 hours later. Although the operation failed to achieve its goals, the first phase of the German invasion, Operation Yellow, had stripped the French Army of its finest formations. The French forces holding the Somme line were mostly reserve divisions of poorer quality and unsupported by heavy artillery, tanks or motorised infantry. The failure of the German air operation did not prevent the German Army from defeating the French in June 1940, or the Luftwaffe in gaining air supremacy at the beginning of Fall Rot.Hooton 2007, pp. 84‚Äì85. The main reason for German superiority in the air was the poor state of French air units' operational readiness. The Luftwaffe had a smaller margin of numerical superiority over the ALA at the start of Fall Rot as the French aviation industry was starting to reach full potential in production. Some 2,000 French aircraft were available despite the loss of 787 aircraft (473 fighters, 120 bombers and 194 reconnaissance aircraft). The French had 2,086 machines available on 5 June 1940, the first day of Fall Rot, but component production did not match the production of airframes. It was slow and poor, and as a result only 599 aircraft (340 fighters and 170 bombers) were serviceable; a rate of just 29 percent.Hooton 2007, p. 81. After the opening of the offensive, the Luftwaffe \\"ran riot\\" over French air space. Such was the superiority of the Luftwaffe at that point, some units were sent home to Germany to refit. The French collapsed altogether just 22 days later, and on 25 June France capitulated.Hooton 2007, pp. 85‚Äì86. References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Bond, Brian. France and Belgium, 1939‚Äì1940.

Namok was taught art at high school and learned printmaking and other techniques through a community art project in 1997 that led to the formation of a group of artists known as the Lockhart River Art Gang. Namok is notable for her paintings, and has won the 2003 High Court of Australia Centenary Art Prize. By 2007 she had held eighteen solo exhibitions in Australia and overseas. Study and early career Namok studied art at high school and when Fran and Geoff Barker‚Äîone a former teacher, the other with experience in design and manufacturing‚Äîset up an art program for school- leavers at Lockhart River, Namok was amongst the first to learn printmaking with them in 1995. In 1997, the Barkers and artists including Namok took some of the prints to an exhibition in Canberra, where they were seen by prominent curators Betty Churcher and Margo Neale, who bought some for the Queensland Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Australia. It was an extraordinary start for what became known as the Lockhart River Art Gang. The Art Gang, of which Namok is a leading member, is distinctive for being a successful Indigenous art movement made up of young members of the community; this contrasts with movements such as Papunya Tula, which emerged from amongst a community's traditional elders. The contrast between Namok's works and those of the central desert artists has highlighted the diversity of contemporary Indigenous art. Recognition Aged 21, Namok won the Australian Heritage Commission's Lin Onus Youth Award for Indigenous art, for her work Kungkay and Yiipay in Salmon Season. The painting was described by the judges as marking \\"a fleeting, inspired moment, capturing it in a permanent patterning\\". In October 2003, Namok's nine-panel painting Today Now... We All Got To Go By The Same Laws won the High Court Centenary Art Prize. Described by Justice Gleeson of the court as a \\"bold, beautiful, confident and contemporary\\" work, it portrayed the emergence of modern law from Aboriginal pre-history. Later that same month, The Bulletin with Newsweek named Namok as amongst its ten \\"brightest, most creative\\" people in Australian arts and entertainment. Namok is a prolific artist, and by 2007, aged 28, had held eighteen solo exhibitions, both in Australia and overseas, in locations including New York and Berlin. She is regarded as an important contemporary Australian artist whose works attract high prices in the art market. Namok's partner is Wayne Butcher, and she has two children, Isaiah, born in September 1997, and Zane, born March 2001. While Namok lives in North Queensland, son Zane was born in Sydney: she had come to the city to submit a painting for the Wynne Prize, but was taken straight from the airport to hospital, where she gave birth.

The United States House Permanent Select Committee on Aging was a permanent select committee of the United States House of Representatives between 1974 and 1992. The committee was created with the intent not of forming legislation directly, but of conducting investigations and holding hearings. In such a manner it would spur legislation and other action via regular committee channels. The action to approve the committee was passed on October 8, 1974, by a 299‚Äì44 margin in the House. The committee became operational in June 1975 and initially had 35 members. Its first chair was Missouri's William J. Randall. The committee soon grew to 65 members. Florida's Claude Pepper, a powerful and influential member of Congress known for his commitment to representing the elderly, became chair in 1977 following Randall's retirement. In his late seventies and early eighties while chairing the committee, Pepper was renowned for his fast-paced presence in Congress; he used himself and the committee to focus attention against the problem of age stereotyping. The committee soon grew to 65 members. In 1983, Pepper stepped aside and Edward R. Roybal of California became chair. The committee conducted research and held public hearings into the issues affecting older Americans. Hearings were given titles, such as 1983's \\"Endless Night, Endless Mourning: Living with Alzheimer's\\". In particular, the committee held hearings and published a number of reports on elder abuse, including Elder Abuse: An Examination of a Hidden Problem, Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace, and Elder Abuse: A Decade of Shame and Inaction. The committee's work led to the passage of reform legislation intended to reform nursing home operations and reducing abuse against their patients. Also resulting were increased home care benefits for the aging as well as legislation establishing research and care centers for Alzheimer's Disease. The committee's work came to an end on October 9, 1992, at the conclusion of the 102nd Congress. It was not renewed during the 103rd Congress, as the House was under pressure to reduce its internal costs and to streamline the legislative process.

Subsequently, this was changed to be voluntary. End-users, however, are not under a mandate to run the software. As of 30 June 2009, the mandatory pre- installation of the Green Dam software on new computers has been delayed to an undetermined date. However, Asian brands Sony, Acer, Asus, BenQ and Lenovo etc. are shipping the software as was originally ordered. On 14 August 2009, Li Yizhong, minister of industry and information technology, announced that computer manufacturers and retailers were no longer obliged to ship the software with new computers for home or business use, but that schools, internet cafes and other public use computers would still be required to run the software.Á∂†Â£©ËªüÈ´î‰∫ã‰ª∂ ‰∏≠ÂúãÂÆòÂì°Ôºö‰∏çÂÜçÂº∑Âà∂ÂÆâË£ù Devoid of state funding since 2009, business behind the software is on the verge of collapsing by July 2010.

Qin Gang, spokesman for the foreign ministry, said the software would filter out pornography or violence: \\"The purpose of this is to effectively manage harmful material for the public and prevent it from being spread,\\" adding that \\"[t]he Chinese government pushes forward the healthy development of the internet. But it lawfully manages the internet\\". In June 2009, state-run Chinese media announced that the installation of the Green Dam Youth Escort would not be compulsory but an optional package. Trials In 2008, under instructions from political leaders, the MIIT implemented a \\"community-oriented green open Internet filtering software project\\" with the support of the Central Civilisation Office and the Ministry of Finance. Its aim was to build a \\"green, healthy network environment, to protect the healthy growth of young people\\". Trials commenced in Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Lanzhou, and Xi'an in October 2008 after the ministry negotiated with the software suppliers and 50 web portals to make the software publicly available without charge, and more than 2,000 installations took place. Trials rolled out to 10 more cities, including Chengdu, Shenyang, Harbin, and Qingdao. The ministry claimed that by December 2008, the software had been downloaded more than 100,000 times, and 3 million times since the end of March 2009. Five leading PC vendors in mainland China, Founder, Lenovo, Tongfang, Great Wall and HEDY, also participated in trial installations.  Censorship concerns  Professor Jonathan Zittrain, of Harvard's Berkman Center said: \\"Once you've got government-mandated software installed on each machine, the software has the keys to the kingdom... While the justification may be pitched as protecting children and mostly concerning pornography, once the architecture is set up it can be used for broader purposes, such as the filtering of political ideas.\\" Colin Maclay, another Harvard academic, said that Green Dam creates a log file of all of the pages that the user tries to access. \\"At the moment it's unclear whether that is reported back, but it could be.\\" In fact, the current software filter contains about 85% political keywords, and only 15% pornography-related keywords.  Reception and responses  = Computer industry = The computer industry advocacy organization, Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), said the development was \\"very unfortunate\\". Ed Black, CCIA president criticised the move as \\"clearly an escalation of attempts to limit access and the freedom of the internet, [...with] economic and trade as well as cultural and social ramifications.\\" Black said the Chinese were attempting to \\"not only control their own citizens' access to the internet but to force everybody into being complicit and participate in a level of censorship\\". The CCIA is reported to be taking up a test case for American tech companies wishing to present \\"a united front against censorship\\" and it is calling on the Obama administration to intervene with Beijing over the requirement that manufacturers pre-install the software on all new computers. On 8 June, Microsoft said that appropriate parental control tools are \\"an important societal consideration\\". However, \\"[i]n this case, we agree with others in industry and around the world that important issues such as freedom of expression, privacy, system reliability and security need to be properly addressed.\\" In an unusual move, an international group of business associations expressed their concern in a letter to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, urging the government to scrap the Green Dam directive. The letter was signed by the heads of 22 organisations representing international businesses, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European-American Business Council, the Information Technology Industry Council and other associations from North America, Europe, and Japan. In moves which the San Francisco Chronicle suggested were politically motivated by the quest for closer ties, Taiwanese manufacturers Acer, Asus, BenQ announced they were already shipping products with Green Dam as originally ordered. They are joined by Sony and Lenovo. = Public = river crab hat, and armed with a paintbrush Online polls conducted by leading Chinese web portals revealed poor acceptance of the software by netizens. On Sina and Netease, over 80% of poll participants said they would not consider or were not interested in using the software; on Tencent, over 70% of poll participants said it was unnecessary for new computers to be preloaded with filtering software; on Sohu, over 70% of poll participants said filtering software would not effectively prevent minors from browsing inappropriate websites. A poll conducted by the Southern Metropolis Daily showed similar results. A report by the OpenNet Initiative project acknowledged the broad global support for measures to help parents limit exposure of their children to harmful online material and published a detailed report on the technical and political flaws of this software and its implications. Internet citizens have created a manga- style Moe anthropomorphism named 'Green Dam Girl' (; Japanese: ), similar to the OS-tans. Many versions exist, but the common features are that she is dressed in green, wears a river crab hat, holding a rabbit (the Green Dam mascot) in hand, and armed with a paintbrush to wipe out online filth. She also commonly wears an armband with the word Discipline written on it. On 11 June 2009, a team released a third-party tool aiming to provide users with options to disable the software, change the master password and perform post- uninstallation clean-up (i.e., removing files and registry entries left behind by the uninstaller). = Government and manufacturer = A BBC News article reported that critics feared this new software could be used by the government to enhance the existing internet censorship system. Jinhui's general manager, [Bryan] Zhang Chenmin, rejecting the accusation: \\"It's a sheer commercial activity, having nothing to do with the government\\" he said. A Global Times article on 10 June replied to a media report viewing the software as spyware by quoting a number of officials; Liu Zhengrong, deputy chief of the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information Office said: \\"The software is designed to filter pornography on the Internet and that's the only purpose of it\\". Qin Gang said the internet had always been open in China and that it was the government's will to prevent the spread of harmful information in accordance with the law. The report mentioned that the MIIT invested 41.7 million yuan ($6.1 million) in the software and is \\"the latest step taken by the government to clamp down on young people accessing porn and violent contents\\". Zhang said: \\"Our software is simply not capable of spying on Internet users, it is only a filter\\", and that the Wall Street Journal had \\"falsely claimed that our software can be used as spyware without having a clear understanding of the product\\". On 10 June, amidst massive criticism circling within the internet about the software and the MIIT's directive, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the agency responsible for censorship, issued an instruction attributed to \\"central leaders\\" requiring the Chinese media to stop publishing questioning or critical opinions. Reports in defense of the official stand appeared subsequently, with a commentary by the state-run Xinhua news agency saying \\"support largely stems from end users, opposing opinions primarily come from a minority of media outlets and businesses\\". The instruction also required online forums to block and remove \\"offensive speech evolved from the topic\\" promptly. In response to the \\"public concern, anger and protest\\" triggered by the government edict, China Daily put forward the case for free choice, saying: \\"Respect for an individual's right to choice is an important indicator of a free society, depriving them of which is gross transgression.\\" On 15 June, an official of the Department of Software Service under the MIIT downplayed the compulsory aspect of the software: \\"The PC makers only need to save the setup files of the program on the hard drives of the computers, or provide CD-ROMs containing the program with their PC packages\\" he said. Users will have the final say on whether or not to install the software, he continued, \\"so it is misleading to say the government compels PC users to use the software ... The government's role is limited to having the software developed and providing it free\\". Further critical articles appeared in both the state-run Peoples' Daily and the relatively liberal China Youth Daily, a paper run by the China Youth League of which Chinese President Hu Jintao was a member and current patron. This leads to the belief that support for the MIIT's directive was divided within the Chinese government itself. On the eve of the introduction of the mandatory pre-installation of the Green Dam software on new computers, it was postponed. The MIIT said it would \\"keep on soliciting opinions to perfect the pre-installation plan.\\" Ministry sources confirmed that the software had been patched, and that the government procurement procedure of the software \\"had complied with China's Government Procurement Law, which was open, fair, transparent, non-exclusive, [...] under strict supervision\\" and \\"in line with regulations of the World Trade Organization\\" = US Government = On meeting with officials of the MIIT and the ministry of commerce about Green Dam, American diplomats in China issued a statement:  Defects and software issues  = Functional defects = Green Dam Youth Escort recognizes pornographic images by analyzing skin-coloured regions, causing the barring of this image of pink-coloured pigs. Jinhui claimed that Green Dam recognizes pornographic images by analyzing skin- coloured regions, complemented by human face recognition. However, according to a Southern Weekly article, the software is incapable of recognizing pictures of nudity featuring black- or red-skinned characters but sensitive enough to images with large patches of yellow that it censors promotional images of the film Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. The article also cited an expert saying that the software's misrecognition of \\"inappropriate contents\\" in applications including Microsoft Word can lead it to forcefully close those applications without notifying the user, and so cause data losses. On 21 June 2009, Ming Pao reported that the software detected and censored pictures of Chinese political leaders as pornography.Ming Pao, 21 June 2009 On 11 June 2009, a BBC News article reported that potential faults in the software could lead to a large-scale disaster. The report included comments by Isaac Mao, who said that there were \\"a series of software flaws\\", including the unencrypted communications between the software and the company's servers, which could allow hackers access to people's private data or place malicious script on machines on the network to \\"affect [a] large scale disaster\\". The software runs only on Microsoft Windows x86, so Microsoft Windows x86-64, Mac OS X, Linux and users of other operating systems are ignored. Even on Microsoft Windows, the software is known to interfere with Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, and is incompatible with Mozilla Firefox. Also on 11 June 2009, a Netease article reported that the master password of the software can be easily cracked. The software stores the MD5 checksum of the password in a text file disguised as a DLL (\`C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\kwpwf.dll\`), thus the password can be arbitrarily set by changing the contents of the file. This was ridiculed by some netizens as the software being crackable by \\"elementary school students\\". Researchers from University of Michigan found the uninstaller \\"appears to effectively remove Green Dam from the computer,\\" whereas some sources state that part of the software (e.g. executables loaded on startup) cannot be removed by its own uninstaller, but that most of it (per either blogs or media reports) was removed according to the PRC government's request. = Security vulnerabilities = On 11 June 2009, Scott Wolchok, Randy Yao, and J. Alex Halderman from the University of Michigan published an analysis of Green Dam Youth Escort. They located various security vulnerabilities that can allow \\"malicious sites to steal private data, send spam, or enlist the computer in a botnet\\" and \\"the software makers or others to install malicious code during the update process\\". They recommended that users uninstall the software immediately for protection. Jinhui's general manager, [Bryan] Zhang Chenmin attacked the Wolchok et al. report as irresponsible action and breach of his company's copyright, and said that Jinhui had been ordered to patch the weaknesses. Wolchok et al. indicated the existence of buffer overflow vulnerabilities which they ascribed to programming errors. Buffer overflow may occur when the software performs URL filtering or updates its blacklist filter files due to the use of fixed-length buffers, and can corrupt the execution stack and potentially allow execution of malicious code. Furthermore, the feature of automatic filter update opens the door to the computer being remotely controlled by the software's makers and possibly third parties who manage to impersonate the update server because the updates are delivered via unencrypted HTTP. The report included an example page that exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability to crash the software. On 12 June 2009, an exploit that takes advantage of the same defect to practically deploy shellcode was published on the website milw0rm.com. The author of the exploit claimed that the exploit is able to bypass the DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms on Windows Vista. = Alleged software plagiarism and license violation = In addition to security vulnerabilities, Wolchok, Yao and Halderman also found that a number of blacklist files used by Green Dam Youth Escort were taken from the censorship program CyberSitter, from Solid Oak Software Inc. The decrypted configuration file references blacklists with download URLs at CyberSitter's website. They also discovered in the software a news bulletin published by CyberSitter in 2004, whose inclusion was conjectured by them to be accidental. A post on the Chinese IT website Solidot published details of the taken files and claimed that the files were outdated. Both the Wolchok et al. report and a technical analysis released on WikiLeaks indicated that software contains code libraries and a configuration file from the BSD-licensed computer vision library OpenCV. The WikiLeaks document said the software violated the BSD license. = U.S. lawsuit = According to The Wall Street Journal, Solid Oak, which had been apprised of the infringement, announced it would file injunctions on US manufacturers to stop them shipping machines with Green Dam. The report included a response by Jinhui Computer System Engineering Co. denying that they stole anything, quoting Bryan Zhang as saying \\"That's impossible\\". Internet lawyer Jonathan Zittrain said that if the computers are only sold in China it would not be a violation of U.S. copyright and the issue \\"would have to be resolved in a Chinese court under Chinese law\\". Solid Oak's Mr Milburn was reported by BBC News as saying that he is not sure legal action will be worth the effort, but would also file a complaint with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Computer Crime Task Force. Hewlett-Packard and Dell were sent cease and desist letters by Solid Oak Software, asking them to respond by 24 June, having determined \\"without a doubt that Green Dam is indeed pirated, and using 100 percent of our code\\". In January 2010, Cybersitter filed a $2.2 billion lawsuit against the PRC government and Jinhui Computer System Engineering charging that Green Dam Youth's developers had stolen more than 5,000 lines of code from Cybersitter. In December 2010, a California court denied a motion to have the suit dropped. The motion was filed by Sony, Acer, BenQ and Asustek, who were named as defendants in a list that also includes Chinese PC makers Lenovo and Haier. = Reactions of the software's makers = According to an addendum to the Wolchok et al. report published on 18 June 2009, makers of Green Dam Youth Escort silently patched the software on 13 June, addressing at least the one particular buffer overflow vulnerability showcased in the original report. In spite of the patch, the software nevertheless remained vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks, as demonstrated by a new example attack page included in the addendum, leading the authors to stand by their previous recommendation that users uninstall the software immediately. According to the same addendum, an update was released on 12 June 2009 to reconfigure the software's filtering blacklists files, which modifies one blacklist and disables the rest. However, files taken from CyberSitter continue to be present on the computer even after the update, and are still used in a pre-update version of the software available from its makers' website. Another update was released on 17 June 2009 to include OpenCV's BSD license into the software's help file to address the license violation issue. = Loss of funding = The project was reportedly dead because the ministry refused to continue funding the project. The Beijing Times reported that Beijing Dazheng Human Language Technology Academy had closed the office for the Green Dam project and up to 30 IT engineers were made redundant, and that co-developer Zhengzhou Jinhui Computer System Engineering, would soon run into financial difficulties through lack of funding. However, Dazheng said it had been forced to downsize (and not shut) the Green Dam unit due to financial constraints. Dazheng's general manager said his company received 19.9 million yuan in the first year and had not received payment since, and that its commitment to providing support and updates for the product was costing 7 million yuan annually. Critics said the lack of transparency in the funding cut cast the Ministry in a bad light. Other commentators, whilst noting no change in the government's policy towards policing the Internet, said the de facto abandonment of the project was an admission of error.

Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (previously known as PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara). The mine is the second largest copper-gold mine in Indonesia behind the Grasberg mine of PT. Freeport Indonesia. The mine is located east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Sumbawa, in southern Taliwang regency, an island in West Nusa Tenggara. The mine is the result of a ten-year exploration and construction program based on a 1999 discovery of the porphyry copper deposit. Production began in 2000. The mine utilizes a \\"truck and shovel\\" open-pit mining method, with ore reporting to semi-Autogenous Grinding and ball mills, followed by a flotation circuit. The finished product is a thickened copper-gold concentrate, which is shipped via pipe to a storage facility on the Indonesian coast. History During 1984, Newmont Corporation undertook conceptual studies and identified the island arc terrain to the east of Bali as being prospective for epithermal gold mineralization. A joint venture was formed with PT. Pukuafu Indah in September 1985, and tenement applications lodged over the islands of Lombok and West Sumbawa Regency. In 1986, a Contract of Work with the Government of Indonesia was signed. During 1987, a regional geochemical sampling program commenced. Due to the mountainous and jungle-covered terrain, samples primarily comprised silt stream-sediment samples. A total of 36 gold anomalies were generated, and prioritized for additional exploration. In 1989, a significant copper and gold anomaly was identified in the Sejorong drainage located near the southwest coast of Sumbawa. Field checking of the anomaly identified altered and Copper- stained diorite float samples in the river bed, and subsequently, strong quartz pyrite stockworking and abundant Copper staining in outcrops within Green Creek. In 1990 mineral exploration on the island of Sumbawa resulted in the discovery of copper mineralization that would be developed into the Batu Hijau mine. The deposit was named for the discovery outcrop, a bright-green oxide-copper occurrence; in Indonesian, \\"Batu Hijau\\" means \\"green rock.\\" Jack H. Morris, Going for Gold: the history of Newmont Mining. 2010, University of Alabama Press, Over the next ten years PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara delineate the resource and began developing the mine and building the required infrastructure. In 1991, core drilling commenced, and continued to 1996. A feasibility study was completed in February 1996. The feasibility study was amended in July 1996 to reflect an updated mine plan based on additional drilling data, a change from fresh water to sea water processing, and a change from distributed diesel power generation to a central, coal-fired power plant. A partnership agreement was entered into with Sumitomo in July 1996, under which Sumitomo became equity partners and co-managers of the Batu Hijau Project. The Indonesian government approved the feasibility study in 1997, allowing construction to commence in the same year. Additional drilling programs continued to define the deposit from 1996 to 1998. Total capital costs for the initial Batu Hijau Project were $1.8 billion. The Batu Hijau mine was the largest \\"green-fields\\" mining project ever built. In 1999 construction was completed and by the next year Batu Hijau was producing ore. In 2016, Newmont Mining Corporation successfully completed the sale of its ownership stake in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara, which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia, to PT Amman Mineral Nusa Internasional. Geology and ore reserves The orebody at Batu Hijau is a porphyry copper type and includes a high gold component, which is common for such copper deposits in southeast Asia. The host rock for porphyry copper deposits in southeast Asia is typically diorite and quartz diorite. Copper sulphides such as chalcopyrite and bornite are frequently associated with the gold component of these deposits. As of the end of 2008, Batu Hijau had an ore reserve of 968mt of ore at 0.41% Cu and 0.29g/t Au. Mining & milling Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau mine Batu Hijau is an open-pit mine. Ore is removed from the mining face using P&H; 4100 electric shovels (pictured) and loaded into Caterpillar 793C haul trucks. Each haul truck can move a payload of ore. The trucks haul ore from the shovel to primary crushers. Crushed ore is sent by a conveyor wide and long to the mill. Daily production from the mine is an average of ore and waste combined. Ore from the mine has an average copper grade of 0.49% and an average gold grade of 0.39g/t. Crushed ore is further reduced in size by Semi-Autogenous Grinding and ball mills. Once milled it is sent through a flotation circuit which produces a concentrate with a grade of 32% copper and 19.9g/t gold. The mill realizes a copper recovery of 89%. The concentrate is thickened into slurry and piped to the port at Benete where water is removed from the slurry. The concentrate storage at the port can hold of copper-gold concentrate. Environmental issues Disposal of tailings from the processing operation of the Batu Hijau mine takes place in the ocean, using a process called Submarine Tailings Disposal (STD). Indonesia is currently the only location that PT. Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara uses this process, claiming that it is more an environmentally sound practice despite being more costly to the company. The process involves piping the tailings off the coast to a drop-off of , which carries the waste down another . Waste rock from the Batu Hijau mine is disposed of in the rainforest, with space for newly produced waste rock running out. Environmentalists are raising concern with the declining population of the yellow-crested cockatoo. References External links *PT.

These types of sediments can often store and transmit large amounts of groundwater and act as a local aquifer. Buried valleys may have been created by glacial lake runoff prior to the last major advance and retreat of continental glaciation. These valleys often have no surface expression, but constitute a major source of groundwater in the glaciated mid- continent region of North America and Northern Europe. Recently, research has been focused on understanding the sedimentology of these formations in an effort to determine the safety of continued use of the aquifers which are often found in them.  Overview  Buried valleys are created when ancient river or stream valleys are present that predate the most recent glaciation, and since have been filled with glacial till and/or outwash.Seyoum, W. , & Eckstein, Y. (2014). Hydraulic relationships between buried valley sediments of the glacial drift and adjacent bedrock formations in northeastern Ohio, USA. Hydrogeology Journal, 22(5), 1193‚Äì1206. In the Pleistocene, advancement and retreat of glaciers carved out the preexisting valleys, and deposited the material that had accumulated in the glacier by the melting of either the glacial outwash or the melting of the ice that composed the glacier itself. Buried valleys are traditionally V- or U-shaped due to the natural shape of valleys, but buried valleys can exhibit different shapes if there were any sort of erosional events after the glacier had finished retreating.Metzen, J. (2012). Discovery of an e-w trending Pleistocene buried valley in the German bight, southern North Sea. Quaternary International, 279‚Äì280, 325. The ability to hold groundwater comes from the makeup of the glacial outwash deposits. The glacial outwash deposits of these preexisting valleys mainly consist of coarser materials, such as sand and gravel. Since these materials are coarser, when there is a soil that is almost purely made of these materials, the pore space of the soil increases. This increased pore space creates more voids for water, especially when compared to silt or clay rich soil. After these valleys are formed and filled in, a layer of finer sediment such as silts and clays covers the top of the valley, burying the valley. Buried valleys are best known as being aquifers, and are often used to supply humans with potable water, as well as supply the agriculture and industrial fields with water.  Mapping buried valleys  Buried valleys are difficult to measure and create models for, as they are normally buried deeply beneath the earth's surface in geologically complex areas. There are several different methods that are used to identify buried valleys, including determining depth to bedrock, the drilling/boring in to the earth's crust to analyze soil makeup, and utilizing existing water wells, although it is said that these methods alone are barely adequate.Oldenborger, G. , Logan, C. , Hinton, M. , Pugin, A. , Sapia, V. , et al. (2016). Bedrock mapping of buried valley networks using seismic reflection and airborne electromagnetic data. Journal of Applied Geophysics, 128, 191‚Äì201. In order to map the buried valleys, dense data coverage is essential. Typically, the borehole density is relatively small and especially deep boreholes are sparse.H√∏yer, A. , J√∏rgensen, F. , Sandersen, P. , Viezzoli, A. , & M√∏ller, I. (2015). 3d geological modelling of a complex buried-valley network delineated from borehole and aem data. Journal of Applied Geophysics, 122, 94‚Äì102. It is important that the borehole density is large throughout the area being mapped so that a higher level of accuracy can be attained. Since the buried valleys are carved out by glaciers, topography can be highly variable. The more borings/ cores that are taken, the more accurate the map will be. Based on depth to bedrock reported in water well observations, the electrical conductivity of bedrock appears largely separable from that of the overlying glacial sediments due to the higher conductivity of the shale present in some soils. In one study done in Denmark, a series of braided buried valleys were found anywhere from 10 m to 300 m below the surface using drilling/boring.He, X. , Sonnenborg, T. , J√∏rgensen, F. , & Jensen, K. (2017). Modelling a real-world buried valley system with vertical non-stationarity using multiple-point statistics. Hydrogeology Journal, 25(2), 359‚Äì370. In order to map the buried valleys, dense data coverage is essential. Although there are no published 3D models of buried models, 2D models have been published many times.  Buried valleys as aquifers  Perhaps what buried valleys are most known for is their ability to become aquifers that store groundwater. The main form of recharge found in buried valley aquifers occurs is the percolation of groundwater through glacial tills and upper intertill aquifers.Dragon, K. (2008). The influence of anthropogenic contamination on the groundwater chemistry of a semi-confined aquifer (the wielkopolska buried valley aquifer, Poland). Water Resources Management, 22(3), 343‚Äì355. In fact, many communities in the Midwest get their water from aquifers that were created from these buried valleys, such as Miami, Ohio. In some prairie buried valleys in Canada, the underlying material is made of dense shale, while the covering over the buried valley is made up of such a dense composition Quaternary fill that it vastly limits recharge of the buried valley aquifer, almost to the point of restricting it completely.Buried-valley aquifers in the Canadian prairies: Geology, hydrogeology, and origin 1 1 earth science sector (ess) contribution 20120131. (2012). Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 49(9), 987‚Äì1004. Recharge is very important, as many different cities all over the world use buried valleys as their main water source. Often, the reason buried valleys are mapped is due to the ability to utilize previously deeply drilled wells that have been supplying water to communities.Kluiving, S. , Aleid Bosch, J. , Ebbing, J. , Mesdag, C. , & Westerhoff, R. (2003). Onshore and offshore seismic and lithostratigraphic analysis of a deeply incised Quaternary buried valley system in the northern Netherlands. Journal of Applied Geophysics, 53(4), 249‚Äì271. Since buried valleys were once valleys on the earth surface, they have a slope or gradient to them.

Molua may have been a native of the kingdom, as a St Moluoc (another form of Molua) is listed as \\"Moluoc mac Luchta mac Finchada mac Feidlimithe mac Sodhan Salbhuidhe.\\" Sodh√°n Salbhuidhe na Sreath - Sogan of the Battle-lines/Sogan of the Preys was a semi-legendary son of a king of Ulster whose people settled in what became called the kingdom of Soghain. This is said to have occurred sometime around 300. Thus Molua was a great-great grandson of the founder of the kingdom, which led Joseph Mannion to comment that \\"The brevity of the pedigree might indicate that he belonged to the very early stages of the Christian period\\", perhaps as early as the late fifth century. He is credited with the erection of a cross at Crossmaloo (Cros mo Luaidh), of which only the base and broken lower shaft remains. It is believed to mark his grave, and was once a traditional resting place for funeral processions leading to the church of Kilmoluagh, of which he was the founder. The name Kilmoluagh no longer exists even as a townland name.
