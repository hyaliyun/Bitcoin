It is the first of only two events of this kind in Australia, the second happening in Sydney in 2007. Background and rampage Hayes had a history of mental health issues, and previous encounters with the police over criminal behaviour, including charges of breaking and entering a delicatessen in 1987, stealing $78,000 worth of counter-terrorist equipment from the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in November 1992, and illegal possession of a firearm in April 1993. In 1987 he was forcibly admitted to the maximum- security wing of Graylands Hospital due to paranoid delusions, and treated for schizophrenia. On the morning of 27 April, Hayes stole an Australian Army M113 APC (without ammunition) from the army depot. Some reports have alleged police abuse and harassment as the motive for his behaviour. Hayes drove the APC through a fence and into the side of the Wembley police station at 4.40am. He then rammed a police van and drove towards the police headquarters in the CBD, where he smashed through the security gates and rammed six police vehicles, a motorcycle, and several private vehicles. He then caused damage to the CIB building before circling Parliament House, where police negotiators failed in efforts to get him to surrender. Three special forces officers climbed onto the vehicle and dropped a tear gas canister into the vehicle, after which he was arrested following a struggle. Aftermath The media coverage treated the event as a surreal and somewhat humorous event. When queried as to the ease with which the vehicle had been stolen, Brigadier Terry Nolan stated that \\"If you'd have asked me this yesterday I would have said it's not easy to do it, but the evidence of this morning would indicate that it's perhaps easier than I would have thought.\\" In court Hayes claimed his actions where retaliation against the police for three attempts to kill him. His defence was later rejected and he was sentenced to four and a half years in Casuarina Prison with the possibility of parole after 17 months. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Hayes died in 2017.

(Delhi Council) in the hill town of Kurseong, Darjeeling, India founded in 1879. The school was initially named Dow Hill School (between 1879‚Äì1888). It is among the oldest schools in India and along with its sister school Dow Hill Girls' School it shares a unique historical background, milieu and heritage.  History  Sir Ashley Eden, an official and diplomat in British India and the then Lieutenant Governor of Bengal started the school in 1879 for railway employees and later extended to the children of middle and lower income group government servants and was paid out of local funds. To serve the purpose a house named ‚ÄòConstantia‚Äô was bought and was converted into a residential school. Children of non-officials were also accepted but they had to pay a higher fee. = First batch of students = In August 1879 the first batch of 16 children arrived, traveling in three tongas from Siliguri, they had to halt at six places before arriving at the school. Within a few years, the number of pupils increased and the space in the old building could not accommodate the numbers anymore. Subsequently, the Railway Offices and Quarters in Dow Hill were vacated and handed over to the Education Department and the school moved to its present location. = First Headmaster and teachers = Mr Edward Pegler was the first Headmaster of the school and was assisted by his wife Mrs Elizabeth Pegler who was later appointed the Headmistress of Dow Hill Girls' School. The Peglers worked on their own till 1885 by which time the School had 103 students. In 1886 two more teachers from England, Mr and Mrs Barnes, arrived to help Mr and Mrs Pegler. The demand for the admission of boys pupils grew the Government decided to reserve the School for boys only in 1888.  Dow Hill and Victoria Schools  = Dow Hill Girls' School inception = Town of KurseongAfter Dow Hill School ceased to be co-educational the girls' section remained closed for six years. After a decade the boys' school was shifted to its current building one kilometer away and was renamed 'Victoria Boys' School' to commemorate the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria of England. Sir Charles Elliot, who had provided funds for the new building authorized the reopening of the girls‚Äô school in the former school building and in 1898 a girls‚Äô only school, 'Dow Hill Girls' School' was established. Now the two schools are situated one kilometer apart amongst beautiful pine forests. = Victoria Boys' School early 1900s = At the end of the year 1905‚Äì06 Victoria Boys' School had 190 pupils all of whom were boarders. It had a staff of 12 teachers and a Gymnastic Instructor. Six of the teachers had English or Irish qualifications and two were undergraduates from the Calcutta University. The staff included a steward, two matrons, a trained nurse and a house-keeper. The school had a technical department affiliated to the Sibpur Civil Engineering College in which a course of two years was provided for boys who passed middle school examination.

Ivanda completed the classical gymnasium in his hometown, occasionally playing minor roles in the HNK, but as he preferred directing, he entered the Academy of Dramatic Arts of the University of Zagreb where he graduated. His directing debut was 1969 modernist piece Gravitacija ili fantastiƒçna mladost ƒçinovnika Borisa Horvata. Following the ban of his documentary about 1971 student demonstrations Poezija i revolucija - studentski ≈°trajk 1971, in the 1970s he focused on television, where he would direct films, dramas, documentary and advertising films for over thirty years. He also accepted occasional theater projects. For his TV and fiction films he received several awards, notably FIPRESCI from the Berlin Film Festival. He has been a dean of the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb since 2004. Ivanda married twice: from the first marriage with Stanka, he had son Nikola, who was also a director and Branko's close assistant in multiple TV projects, such as popular series Obiƒçni ljudi, Ponos Ratkajevih, Sve ƒáe biti dobro and Dolina sunca.

Origins The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8.Westlake. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1888 proposed a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. Under this scheme a number of Volunteer Battalions in Southern Scotland would assemble together at Glasgow as the Clyde Brigade.Army List, various dates.

Reorganisation With a total of 17 battalions this brigade was larger than most VIBs and in 1890 it was split into two, the Volunteer Battalions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders continuing in the Clyde Brigade, while the Scottish Rifles and Highland Light Infantry formed a separate Glasgow Brigade. Sir William Cuninghame went to command the Glasgow Brigade and was succeeded in command of the Clyde Brigade by Col Sir Donald Matheson, commanding officer of the 1st Lanarkshire Engineer Volunteer Corps and Honorary Colonel of the Clyde Division, Engineer Volunteers, Submarine Division. The new HQ of the Clyde Brigade was at 142 West George Street, Glasgow.Matheson at Ubique.com Sir Donald Matheson resigned in 1898,London Gazette, 1 February 1898.London Gazette, 24 May 1898. after which the HQ was moved to Stirling and the Officer Commanding 91st Regimental District (the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders' depot) became ex-officio brigade commander.

It was the forerunner of two formations of the Territorial Force that saw service in both World Wars. Origins The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1888 proposed a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. Under this scheme a number of Volunteer Battalions of regiments in Southern Scotland would assemble together at Glasgow as the Clyde Brigade.Army List, various dates. The Brigade Headquarters (HQ) was at 137 St Vincent Street, Glasgow, and the brigade commander was Colonel Sir William Cuninghame, VC, appointed 17 October 1888. With a total of 17 battalions this brigade was larger than most VIBs and in 1890 it was split into two, the Volunteer Battalions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders continuing in the Clyde Brigade, while the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and Highland Light Infantry formed a separate Glasgow Brigade. Sir William Cuninghame continued in command of the Glasgow Brigade]. Organisation From 1890 the Glasgow Brigade had the following composition:Army List, various dates. * 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps (a Volunteer Battalion of the Scottish Rifles) * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Scottish Rifles * 3rd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps (a Volunteer Battalion of the Scottish Rifles) * 4th Volunteer Battalion, Scottish Rifles * 5th Volunteer Battalion, Scottish Rifles * 1st Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 3rd (Blythswood) Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 9th Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps (a Volunteer Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry) * 5th (Glasgow Highland) Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * Supply Detachment, Army Service Corps * Bearer Company, Army Hospital Corps, later Royal Army Medical Corps Sir William Cuninghame retired in 1897, after which the HQ moved to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire and the Officer Commanding 26th and 71st Regimental District (the Cameronians and HLI depot) became ex-officio brigade commander. Boer War All the battalions provided volunteers to serve alongside the Regular regiments in the 2nd Boer War and gained the Battle honour South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. Disbandment The Volunteer Infantry Brigades were reorganised in 1902 and the Glasgow Brigade was split up. The four Volunteer Battalions of the Cameronians constituted the new Scottish Rifles Brigade, while the four Volunteer Battalions of the Highland Light Infantry became the Highland Light Infantry Brigade. These successor brigades were carried through when the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. They formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF. During World War I they became the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade in the 52nd (Lowland) Division, and formed Second Line duplicates as the 195th (2/1st Scottish Rifles) Brigade and 196th (2/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade of the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914.

The site has a picnic shelter with signs that tell the story of the site, with artwork by local Aboriginal people. Overview Prior to European colonisation of Australia and the encroachment of settlers into Wiradjuri lands, the Koonadan lunette dune served as a hunting and fishing ground for Wiradjuri people due to its location next to Tuckerbil Swamp. A bora ground was also located between the Koonadan dune and Tuckerbil Swamp, but evidence of it has been erased by changes in land use. In the late 19th century, many Wiradjuri were removed from the Koonadan area to Warangesda and Euabalong, not returning until the gradual closing of missions and Aboriginal reserves between the mid-1920s to 1950s, when many settled in Leeton and Narrandera. After the 1950s, the site was cleared of trees, and Tuckerbil Swamp was drained, which has greatly diminished the areas food resources. In the early 1980s, sand mining of the Koonadan dune unearthed skeletal remains associated with two different skeletons, which were then reburied by the local Aboriginal community. The recommencement of sand mining led to protests and blockading of the site by the local Wiradjuri community, leading to the end of sand mining at Koonadan. An agreement between the landholder and NSW government saw the eventual purchase of the southern part of the Koonadan dune, which was then declared an 'Aboriginal place' under the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act.

It allowed the connection of computers and other devices with composite video outputs to a television.  History  Apple Inc. wanted to provide users of their Apple II computers with a way to view color output on a television, but they had trouble getting FCC approval, because the RF modulation solution they were using was too noisy. Apple made an arrangement with a small nearby company, called M&R; Enterprises, to manufacture and sell the devices. While Apple could not sell the modulator and computer as a package, retail computer dealers could sell both devices to the end user. Marty Spergel, who ran M&R; Enterprises, was told by Steve Jobs that it might sell as many as 50 units a month. Spergel later estimated that he had sold about 400,000 units. The Sup 'R' Mod II began selling in April 1978, for $29.95.  Technical features  Modulator and antenna switch. The Sup 'R' Mod II kit came with a small printed circuit board, an antenna switch, and a coaxial cable with a ferrite core and RCA connectors. Composite video was received by the circuit board through a short cable terminating in a molex connector, which plugged into a header on the Apple II motherboard. Input could also be provided through an RCA connector. The output of the RF modulator went out through a coaxial cable to the antenna switch. The antenna switch allowed the user to select between television broadcasts and computer output. The television antenna was connected to inputs on the switch, and the switch output was connected to the back of the television. The connections used screw terminals with spade lugs. Moving the switch from \\"TV\\" to \\"GAME PLAY\\" selected the computer output. The board and antenna switch came with a bit of double-sided tape to allow the user to attach them to the inside of the computer case and the side of the television, respectively.

It was built from 1860 to 1890. It is also known as Essington Christian Centre; Westmead Christian Grammar School. The property is owned by Church of the Foursquare Gospel. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Essington was built for one of Holroyd's important pioneers, William Fullagar as his second, residence, opposite his first, (The Wattles or Wattle Cottage) as a gentleman's villa on the northern side of the Great Western Highway in a prominent position. Reportedly it was designed and decorated with no expense spared. Fullagar was the son of convicts John Fulligar and Esther Leadham, and he demonstrates the upward mobility of descendants of many individuals transported to NSW. Fullagar was a butcher and publican turned stock agent who was in the process of buying large tracts of neighbouring properties and making his way up in the world. From his base at The Wattles or Wattle Cottage, he bought sufficient land to make him one of Holroyd's important pioneers whose estates covered much of Wentworthville. William Fullagar purchased the James grant, to the south of the present Essington, in 1849, and \\"soon after he purchased it, he fenced it and built his residence upon it and went there to live, and lived there continuously from that time until within a few years of his death\\". When he bought James's 30 acres, Fullagar was the lessee of the neighbouring Burder Park estate (later Finlayson's Estate) a property immediately west of James's grant belonging to descendants of Rowland Hassall, William Davis and John Bolger - these are all marked on a 1908 map of the Parish of St. John. He then purchased land from the Burder Park estate in 2 lots of in 1851 and 1854, the last section of on the south-west corner was not acquired until 1866. He used the property as part of his business for cattle grazing and in later years, agistment as well as growing hay and other feed crops, timber cutting, making bricks and cultivating part of it as an orchard. All statements agreed that once he moved to Willow Cottage, Fullagar never lived anywhere else until he built his new residence opposite the property 'some few years before he died in 1894. By the 1870s Fullagar was one of the major landholders in the Parramatta district. The lots he acquired in 1859-61 were during the sale of an extensive portion of the NSW Government Domain (by the 1850s 'Parramatta Park'). In fact Fullagar owned much of present-day Wentworthville. Although continuing his stock auction activities, Fullagar aspired to the status of a gentleman. He had time to pursue the hounds in fox hunts organised apparently under his patronage. He was reputedly a crack rider whose long riding stick is clearly visible in a portrait. He was also, for a time, one of the trustees of Parramatta Park. Fullagar's Paddock was occasionally used by others, e.g.: cadets from Sydney Grammar School and The King's School combined for an encampment there on the Queen's Birthday, 22 May 1875. The date he moved over the road to his new house Essington is vague from the existing records. This move appears to have occurred in the late 1880s as his wife, Sarah Fullagar, died at Essington on 24 March 1889. At the time of the 1891 census there were two males and five females at Essington. William Fullagar died there on 8 August 1894, a week after signing his last will and testament. The will offers a convenient summary of his property: it required the sale of three parcels of land - the site of his former residence, Willow Cottage; adjoining Bailey's Orchard near Parramatta north of the railway line; and the site of Essington together with neighbouring allotments, the extensive holdings purchased from Parramatta Park. After costs the money was to be distributed, first in defined bequests - to William Fullagar the younger, to married daughters Hannah Barnes and Sarah Houison, to his grandson Thomas Barnes and to Adah Rebecca Harrex, (Sarah's cousin and possibly the family retainer). Any balance of the sale was to be divided equally between the 8 surviving children from his second marriage - five daughters and three sons. The first attempt to sell any land from the estate occurred shortly after probate was granted when Fullagar's Paddocks were subdivided and auctioned on 9/2/1895. It appears this auction was unsuccessful. Another was held on 25 September 1897, again without provoking much interest, for the only buyer was a family member, Amy Adah Hughes, so the trustees decided to apply for Torrens Title, possibly to encourage sales.Broomham & Hughes, 1997, 11 Holroyd Heritage Study 1993 notes that Essington was built by a family member, William John Fullagar and sold by him in 1912. Surrounding land \\"the Fullagar Estate\\" was further subdivided from .Holroyd Heritage Study, 1993 In s the verandah on the house was replaced. The Four Square Gospel Church, Parramatta bought the property and erected the subject picket fence in 1982. From 1983 the Church has run a primary school on site. The church has acquired neighbouring houses with a view to expansion.Stuart Read, from Rev.B.Banton, pers.comm, 14/1/2008  Description  ;Garden The house is surrounded to the east and south by lawns and mature plantings of trees. A limited number of trees including a large remnant Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (A.cunninghamii) and vestiges of its original garden remain on the property, principally on its southern side facing the Great Western Highway, and on the eastern side facing Bridge Street. To the north is principally car parking areas over former grounds, and rear extensions for class rooms/ administration. To the north the site is predominantly bitumen car parking area, accessed off Bridge Road. To the west additions to the house have been made to provide for school classrooms.Read, S., pers. comm., 2006, updated 17/1/2008 ;House Essington is a large two-storey historic house now run as a school, by the Church of the Foursquare Gospel. It is located on the north-western corner of Bridge Road and the Great Western Highway, with its principal facades facing these roads. Its site is elevated and in combination with the house's high ceilings and steep roof, this gives it prominence in the local area. The house's original block - a late Victorian/Federation building with \\"Italianate\\" and \\"Gothic\\" elements - was L-shaped with gabled roofs finished with timber bargeboards and turned finials. Walls are polychrome brick and the building has a slate roof. A projecting bay window on the front (east) elevation features 2x2 pane double hung sash windows with sandstone sills and heads; first floor windows on the bay feature \\"four-centred\\" arch heads. The original verandah was replaced by later (probably inter-war period) two storey verandah to the front and side (south) elevations with brickwork columns, first floor balustrade and paired \\"stump\\" columns. Various additions including single storey block of rendered masonry and a recent two-storey wing of face brickwork with metal framed sliding windows.Holroyd LEP A 1990 classroom extension was made on the house's western side.

Heritage listing  As at 26 August 2008, Essington has historic significance primarily through its association with the Fullagers who were one of the prominent families in the early settlement of Holroyd. The site comprises part of the former government domain purchased by William Fullager c .1860 and the residence built by another Family member Willard John Fullager sometime later. The residence and grounds also provide evidence of the presence and character of the relatively substantial gentlemen's residences erected in the Holroyd area during the 19th and early 20th Century period though its aesthetic significance as a representative example of a particular period and style has been somewhat compromised by later additions and alterations.Holroyd Heritage Study 1992 Essington was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

He was considered the \\"public face\\" of the dam project. Biography Simegnew was born in 1964 in the small town of Maksegnit located in Begmeder Province (now in the Amhara Region). He completed a course at the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) technical training center in 1986. He taught at the institution for a while after graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering from Addis Ababa University in 1997. He served as deputy project manager for the Gilgel Gibe I and the project manager for the Gilgel Gibe II dams. In 2011 he was designated project manager for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), since the start of its construction in 2011. In 2015 the Tigrai Online e-magazine named him as its person of the year. Death On the morning of 26 July 2018, Simegnew was found shot dead in his Toyota Land Cruiser on Addis Ababa Meskel Square by a civilian passing through the car. Speaking at a press conference, Ethiopian Federal Police Commissioner Zeinu Jemal said that he had been found with a Colt gun in his right hand and a bullet wound behind his right ear, however foul play has been suspected. Simegnew had been scheduled to give a press conference on the progress of the dam later that day, following comments by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed that construction could take up to ten more years, far more than previous projections. He was the public face of the dam being built near the country's western border with Sudan that, when completed, would be Africa's largest. Simegnew's death is the second of a high-profile company official at around that time. In May, gunmen ambushed and killed Deep Kamara, the country manager for Nigeria's Dangote Cement, alongside two others in the Oromia region outside Addis Ababa. Simegnew's death sparked protests in Addis Ababa, with marchers demanding justice for what they assumed was his assassination. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Meskel Square and along Menelik II Avenue to witness his funeral procession on 29 July. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reacted to the news, saying he was \\"saddened and utterly shocked\\" by the engineer's death. On 7 September, police investigation reports suggested that Simegnew committed suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Conspiracy theories relating to his death circulated by some skeptics who promote anti- governmental rhetoric, whether he was killed by government agent or TPLF's recruiter.

Through choreography, she expresses interaction between others, comedy, humility and love. Faye intertwines choreography with traditional studio art as she makes dances that are mistaken for installations. Her choreography has also been seen as written plays rather than dance. Many of her performances include verbal elements as well as extensive use of props, that break away from the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù and focus more on fantasy. The viewer is placed on a rollercoaster as they view the performance, emotions such as joy, outrage, and discomfort are expected in a singular viewing.

Campbell also serves on the board of MST Development Corporation (MST), a corporate entity which manages real estate properties owned by a partnership between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Squamish Nation, and the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. In 2018, he became the Vision Vancouver mayoral candidate for the 2018 Vancouver municipal election, but withdrew before the election. Life and political career Campbell is a member of the Squamish Nation. He lives in North Vancouver, British Columbia. In the years leading up to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, Campbell was involved in the negotiations for First Nation governments participation in the games, as the Four Host First Nations. In July 2010, Campbell, along with other First Nation leaders, called for Stanley Park to be renamed Xwayxway, a historic aboriginal name for the area. In 2014, Campbell was a founding member of MST, participating in negotiations between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Squamish Nation, and the Tsleil-Waututh Nation for joint management of real estate on lands over which the First Nations groups had overlapping claims in the British Columbia Treaty Process. Based on the corporation's own estimates, MST's properties are valued at more than $1 billion. In 2015, Campbell was one of the first graduates of the Simon Fraser University MBA in Aboriginal Business and Leadership. As a hereditary chief of the Squamish Nation, Campbell has been opposed to the proposed Woodfibre LNG project and the Trans Mountain Pipeline. He was chief when the nation filed a court challenge against the pipeline. In October 2017, Campbell proposed tearing down the Fairmont Academy, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) barracks. He claimed doing so would assist the reconciliation process, citing the historic \\"marginalization of Indigenous peoples\\" by the RCMP. In May 2018, Campbell announced that he intended to run for mayor of Vancouver in the 2018 election. Shortly after his announcement, he was confirmed as the Vision Vancouver mayoral candidate, replacing Gregor Robertson, who is not seeking re-election. Campbell campaigned on the promise of expanding the Broadway Skytrain extension to the University of British Columbia. On September 10, several days before the deadline to file necessary paperwork with Elections BC, Campbell announced that he would be withdrawing from the race.

It was released as a single along with a music video on June 25, 2018, and was later featured on their sixth studio album Cool Patrol, released on August 17, 2018. Written by band members Dan Avidan and Brian Wecht as well as producer Jim Roach, the song is a power ballad based on Avidan's life, and tells the story of a young, troubled Danny Sexbang being visited by his older self, who convinces him of his worth and tells him of all the good things awaiting him in the future. The music video, which became the #1 trending video on YouTube when released, features Finn Wolfhard as the young Danny. The band called \\"Danny Don't You Know\\" their \\"favorite-ever song\\", both musically and as a video.  Music video  The music video was released on YouTube on June 25, 2018. Finn Wolfhard, a friend of Avidan since he had appeared on Avidan's web show Game Grumps in January 2017 and a fan of the band, was featured as a younger Danny Sexbang, with small appearances by Arin Hanson, Nathan Sharp, Markiplier, Pamela Horton, Tupper Ware Remix Party, Lasercorn, Mica Burton and former Game Grumps editor Kevin Abernathy. The video was produced by Shawn Wallace, with Bret Rea serving as on-set producer, Gordon Yould as cinematographer, Traci Hays as production designer, and Nicole Case as art director.  Reception  After its release, the music video became the #1 trending video on YouTube, and peaked at #24 on Billboards Rock Digital Song Sales. Classic Rock praised the song and video, calling it a \\"power ballad life lesson triumph\\" and stating \\"Ninja Sex Party instruct all the nerds of the world to rock on... and it's the message we all need in 2018\\". The A.V. Club stated about the song \\"Is it gimmicky? Certainly‚Äîas much as Ninja Sex Party‚Äôs knowingly jokey music, whose glammed-up-but-smoothed-out bombast comes off like The Darkness if it were aping Starship instead of Queen.

Baksey Cham Krong (also spelled Baksey Chamkrong or Baksei Chamkrong, ) was a rock band active in pre-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. They are regarded as Cambodia's first guitar band or first rock band. Baksey Cham Krong formed in 1959, with Mol Kagnol, his brother Mol Kamach, and Samley Hong. The Mol brothers were from a wealthy family and were able to listen to Western radio stations, becoming influenced by singers Paul Anka and Pat Boone, plus the guitar-driven music of The Ventures and Chuck Berry. Mol Kagnol, 14 years old at the time and nicknamed \\"Uncle Solo,\\" played lead guitar while Kamach performed vocals. They likened themselves to Cliff Richard and The Shadows, and modeled their stage presence after Richard's 1961 movie The Young Ones. Ben Sisario of The New York Times described the band's sound as \\"an innocently romantic brand of surf-rock.\\" They gained popularity throughout Cambodia but due to their parents' disapproval, and the unlikelihood of turning music into a viable career, the group broke up in 1966. Some members went on to form another group called Bayon Band. Mol Kamach went to college to study finance, and Mol Kagnol went on to study engineering. Kagnol joined the military and was training in the United States when the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, killing at least 20 of the Mol brothers' family members during the ensuing Cambodian genocide. The band was featured in the 2015 documentary film Don't Think I've Forgotten. In an interview with Mol Kagnol, he said that he remembers his brother attracting a lot of girls, and that he attracted a lot of boys who wanted to learn to play guitar. According to Folio Weekly, the band \\"created a tsunami of guitar bands that played everything from hot-rod rock to go-go.\\" Baksey Cham Krong's music exerted a wide influence on the Cambodian rock and pop scene, while older singers like Sinn Sisamouth were inspired by the band's popularity to add rock songs to their repertoires. The band reunited for a performance in New York City in 2015, with another pre-Khmer Rouge rock band, Drakkar, which cites Baksey Cham Krong as one of its influences.

Career Harris was born in Montgomery, Alabama in 1983. He spent much of his early life between Montgomery and Dadeville, AL, where his relatives had lived since the Revolutionary War. His mother was a teacher and his father worked in heavy construction. When he was seven, his family moved to Apple Valley, California and later to Las Vegas. When Harris was fourteen he left home after finishing the 8th grade. After leaving home, he spent time in Oakland, CA; he chose the Bay Area as the California punk bands of the 1980s and early 90s had a major influence on his early musical development, and later spent a year in Arizona where he worked as a sheep herder for a group of Navajo elders. Throughout this time, Harris freighthopped across the US, eventually finding his way to the town of Halifax, Vermont where he lived for over a decade. He worked as a sheet metal scrapper, orchard worker, farmer laborer, luthier, heavy equipment operator, logger, and mainly as an historic restoration carpenter. He moved to Nashville, TN in 2011. From the time he was sixteen until his relocation to Nashville, he lived in various remote cabins without electricity or running water for nearly 13 years. Despite his busy tour schedule, Harris continues to work as a carpenter within the music community in Nashville. Harris still occasionally builds open-back banjos, though has only produced four instruments since leaving Vermont. He performs primarily with his band the Tough Choices and as a duo with Chance McCoy of Old Crow Medicine Show. In 2014 he curated and produced the one-off Keep It Country Music Festival at Bandit Town in North Fork, CA, with the express purpose of showcasing Bakersfield country legend Red Simpson. This was the last major public appearance by Red before his death in 2015. The festival also featured Whitey Morgan, Nikki Lane, and other indie-country acts. Harris has continued to curate and produce recurring and one-off events for AmericanaFest, LR Baggs Acoustic Amplification, and the Newport Folk Festival. He has performed at many of the major folk and roots festivals including Newport Folk Festival, The Lowell Folk Festival, FloydFest, and many others. Influences Harris heard country music growing up in Alabama but didn't start playing the genre until he left home at age 14. He's noted that he didn't appreciate the genre until he lived on his own: \\"The reason country music became more resonant with me as I got older is that it‚Äôs sort of identifiable by anybody. Everybody‚Äôs just working to get by, and country music just happens to be the soundtrack to that.‚Äù After his interest in punk and heavy metal waned in his teenage years, he discovered the old-time music scene and began playing clawhammer banjo. \\"All I wanted to do was go to fiddler's conventions all summer long and play music till the sun came up,\\" says Harris. \\"So, at that time, I was really opposed to plugging anything in, even people putting pickups on their guitars.\\" His musical style has also been heavily influenced by the early country music of the Carter Family, Jimmie Rodgers, Doc Watson, and the 1960s and 70s generation of artists like George Jones, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Merle Haggard. Harris describes his music as simply \\"country,\\" however others have noted influences like western swing, honky-tonk, outlaw country, and the Bakersfield sound. Wide Open Country has described Harris' voice as \\"timeless.\\" Discography =JP Harris and the Tough Choices= *Sometimes Dogs Bark at Nothing (2018), Free Dirt Records *Home Is Where The Hurt Is (2014), Cow Island Music *I'll Keep Calling (2011), Cow Island Music =with Chance McCoy= *Two Bad Hombres (2017), self- released =EPs and Singles= *Why Don't We Duet in the Road (2016), Demolition & Removal Records References External links JP Harris at Discogs.com Category:1983 births Category:21st-century American singers Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American male guitarists Category:Country musicians from Alabama Category:Country musicians from Tennessee Category:Songwriters from Tennessee Category:American street performers Category:Living people Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:Songwriters from Alabama Category:Guitarists from Alabama Category:Guitarists from Tennessee Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"JP Harris"},{"id":"58002841","text":"Frederik Ernst Koopman (22 October 1887 - 13 June 1980) was a Dutch rower.

Officially formed in October 2017 with a membership of 13 countries, the organization has the stated aim of advancing food security for dryland nations and innovating technologies in the fields of agriculture and water security. History Preliminary drafts for the establishment of the GDA were first laid out in 2011. In September 2011, Qatari diplomat Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser first publicly brought up the idea of forming a group for dryland countries at a United Nations (U.N.) meeting as a way to help improve food security. Qatari capital Doha played host to a meeting of sixteen prospective member countries and various potential partner groups in September 2012. The next year, Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani pledged a full committal to the formation of the GDA at the 68th U.N. General Assembly. At the Ministerial Conference on Food Security in Drylands held in May 2015 in Marakesh, Morocco, a draft establishment treaty of the GDA was presented to the delegations in attendance. The inaugural GDA conference took place on 15 October 2017 in Doha, during which the foundation treaty was signed by representatives of 13 countries. During the conference, it was announced that Qatar would fund the organization for the following two years and that its base of operations would be in Doha. Mission According to the GDA, one-third of the world's population live in drylands, which make up roughly 40% of the Earth's land surface. Drylands face many agricultural and water challenges due to several factors such as droughts, temperature extremes, soil erosion and shallow soil depth. Hence, the GDA has outlined several ways to help improve the food security of nations with large swathes of drylands, such as forming partnerships with private and public sector organizations, sharing and developing technologies that will help boost food security, financing food security projects in member countries, and addressing food security policies of dryland countries.

Approximately long and wide, it is separated from Lake Superior to the north by a quarter-mile-wide strip of land that is the site of Muskallonge Lake State Park. Relatively shallow, the lake's deepest point is below the water surface. The lake sits at above sea level, above Lake Superior. Geology Muskallonge Lake was created during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, some 6,000 to 4,000 years ago. Since that time, it has been cut off from Lake Superior by a strip of land averaging one quarter of one mile wide. The surface sediments in the area of the lake consist of glacial drift made up clay, silt, sand, and gravel. The sand immediately surrounding and beneath Lake Muskallonge have been shown to be hydrophobic, a unique characteristic that contributes to Muskallonge Lake's maintaining a water level elevation significantly higher than the water level of Lake Superior despite the proximity of the much larger body of water. History During the 19th century, the lake was used as a mill pond for white pine logs brought by narrow gauge railroad lines to feed the sawmill at the town of Deer Park. Remnants of its lumbering days are seen in partly submerged logs found in the lake. Fishing Muskallonge Lake supports a variety of fish including northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, walleye, and smallmouth bass. It is a popular destination for ice fishing.

Notability  Del Priore was recognized as \\"one of America's top portrait artists\\".. He lived in Fork Shoals, in upstate South Carolina, https://southcarolina.hometownlocator.com/sc/greenville/fork-shoals.cfm however, he garnered international acclaim in his 40+ year career by doing over 850 oil portraits of subjects that include Members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, Governors, clergy, educators, physicians, cultural, corporate, and community leaders. 24 of his works are listed in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery Catalog of American Portraits.  Official portraits  Del Priore's notable portraits include President Ronald Reagan, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and former Speaker of the House, Representative John Boehner. Thirteen of his portraits are in the art collection of the U. S. House of Representatives, the second largest number by a single artist in U. S. history, https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and- Publications/Capitol/Speaker-Portrait-Collection/ ten are displayed in the South Carolina Statehouse art collection . http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/1aa/1aa388.htm. He painted portraits for eight of South Carolina's Governors: Strom Thurmond, Ernest F. \\"Fritz\\" Hollings, Donald S. Russell, Robert Evander McNair, James B. Edwards, Richard Riley, Carroll A. Campbell Jr., and David Beasley. Among his portraits displayed in the South Carolina Statehouse, three in the Senate Chamber, are acclaimed Senators: Edward E. Saleeby, John Drummond https://m.legacy.com/obituaries/thestate/obituary.aspx?n=john-w- drummond&pid;=181299819&referrer;=0&preview;=false and John W. Matthews, Jr. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Matthews_Jr. Two of his paintings in the House Chamber are of former House Speakers, David H. Wilkins and Robert J. Sheheen.  Early career  Del Priore's artistic talents were evident in his childhood. After graduating from Columbia High School in 1972, he got a job locally as an advertising artist with J.B. White's department store, producing art for The State newspaper, and doing freelance art for local businesses. He befriended established portrait artist Gian Cassone after observing him painting exceptional portraits in a booth at Richland Mall. Cassone, who had studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy, saw Del Priore's raw talent but noted his lack of experience and told him, \\"Go home and draw a thousand heads, then I'll teach you what you need to know.\\" Del Priore completed the huge task, returning in just six weeks. Cassone never expected to see him again, but true to his word, he introduced Del Priore to master techniques of portrait painting in oil and pastel. Under Cassone's tutelage, he completed hundreds of portraits during a 5-year stint at the mall location. In 1979, Del Priore was commissioned to paint his first nationally known, publicly-elected official when Congressman William Jennings Bryan Dorn asked him to do his portrait for permanent display in the lobby of the new Dorn VA Hospital in Columbia, named in his honor. In 1980, on Cassone's recommendation, Del Priore moved to Charleston, SC, to study oil painting under renowned artist Ray Goodbred at the Gibbes Museum of Art. Goodbred, who had studied at the Art Students League under Ogden Pleissner and Robert Brackman, maintained dual residences in New York and Charleston at the time. Goodbred taught him master skills including palette organization, anatomy basics and manipulation of brushes by painting from live models and doing still life studies. After returning to Columbia in 1984, Del Priore entered a competition announced in The State newspaper for artists to do an official oil portrait of former governor, U. S. Senator Strom Thurmond for the Senate Chamber of the South Carolina Statehouse, honoring his 50th year of public service. Over 200 artists responded. The selection narrowed to two, Del Priore and famed portraitist, Robert Bruce Williams of Washington, DC. \\"In this case, being a South Carolinian worked to my advantage,\\" said Del Priore. \\"Because Senator Thurmond was famous for supporting constituents from his home state, he chose me. Afterward, the positive response I received from the public helped me move from the mall to a studio, as I no longer had to search for commissions. It was a great blessing and a major milestone in my career.\\" Del Priore established professional relationships with America's leading portrait artists, studying with John Howard Sanden, the late Daniel Greene, Richard Whitney, the late Nelson Shanks, and the late Everett Raymond Kinstler. He lectured and gave portrait demonstrations at the University of South Carolina, the Columbia Museum of Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Art Students League of New York; the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and the Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art in Chicago.

He notes that it is difficult to explain the discrepancy between the declared ethnicity and language: the locals can be ether Polonized Belarusians, or Belarusianized Poles, or even Belarusianized Lithuanians who later became Polonized. He also notes a lingistic puzzle how \\"simple speech\\" survived without codification and formal education despite 200 years of Russification and tens of years of Polonization. Jankowiak also notes that Bronis≈Çaw Taraszkiewicz who was first to codify the Belarusian language (1918, \\"Tara≈°kievica\\") hailed from Maƒçiuli≈°kƒós of Vilnius region, and it appears that his version of Belarusian was influenced by the \\"simple speech\\" native to him.

Desmond says he was inspired by drag queens on RuPaul's Drag Race, and began fashioning household items into dresses and wigs. In 2014, when he was six, he made his professional debut in a Jinkx Monsoon music video. He came to wider attention in 2015 when videos of him voguing through the NYC Pride March went viral. In February 2018, he made his fashion runway debut, and was in the accompanying campaign. He has since done high fashion shoots, runways, and campaigns for numerous brands, and was named a spokesperson for Converse and NYC Pride. He has also become a public speaker on LGBTQ issues: his public appearances include both traditional drag performance and LGBTQ advocacy. He identifies as genderfluid and gay, and has been described as androgynous. In 2017 he received the Marsha P. Johnson 'Don't be Outraged, Be Outrageous' Award, in 2018 he was named to the Dazed100 most influential people shaping youth culture, and named to the Out100, as one of \\"the most influential LGBTQIA figures,\\" and in 2019 he served as grand marshal of Brooklyn's pride parade. His doing drag has raised criticism from social conservatives for the perceived sexualization of a child, resulting in harassment and death threats. Out magazine has described these criticisms and attacks as \\"blatant homophobia and transphobia\\". His book, Be Amazing, was released in June 2020. Biography = Early childhood = Desmond Napoles was born in June 2007 in Manhattan, New York City. When he was two, he watched RuPaul's Drag Race with his mother and was captivated by the show's drag queens. Desmond began to play dress-up by fashioning household items into dresses and wigs. His parents early on thought he might be transgender because of his preference for girls' clothing. They stated that at the age of two or three, they thought that he was \\"likely gay\\" and they exposed him to a variety of gay culture, including showing him drag performances and taking him to pride parades starting at age four or five. He identifies as gay and states that he has been out since a very early age. When he was six, the family consulted a therapist about whether letting him wear dresses was okay; they were told not to force the issue either way but \\"to let it happen naturally\\". Around the same time he got his first non-homemade drag clothing: a Halloween costume of Queen Elsa of Arendelle from the film Frozen. His stage name came from a friend of his mother who created a 'Desmond is Amazing' Facebook fan page. In December 2017, his mother stated that he is autistic and drag and performing help him cope. =2014‚Äì2016= Desmond gave his first drag performance in 2014, at age six, appearing in Jinkx Monsoon's music video for The Bacon Shake as a flapper alongside Fred Schneider of The B-52's, who wrote the song. Soon after he became interested in drag ball culture, an underground LGBTQ subculture of mainly young black and Latino people structured in competing \\"houses\\" popularized by the 1990 film Paris Is Burning. Desmond admired two of the film's stars, Pepper LaBeija and Willi Ninja. He started voguing, and later took lessons from choreographer Leiomy Maldonado. He participated in the annual New York City Pride March for the first time in June 2015, voguing the entire route. A video of him dancing went viral. In June 2020, he recalled the day as his favorite Pride memory as yet. In June 2017 he competed in the NYC Legacy Ball hosted by Sydney UltraOmni and was invited to join the vogue troupe \\"Iconic House of UltraOmni\\", founded by Kevin Burrus. , Desmond is the youngest member of the troupe. In the voguing world he is known as Desi UltraOmni. At the ball, his mother was encouraged to expand his social media presence to Instagram where pictures of his looks could easily be shared. In June 2018 he had nearly 60,000 followers; that increased to 181,000 followers. The New York Times estimates that as of September 2019 there are more than a hundred public drag kids in the U.S.; Desmond has the biggest following. = 2017‚Äì2018 = In June 2017 Desmond was presented the Marsha P. Johnson 'Don't be Outraged, Be Outrageous' Award by Heritage of Pride, producers of New York City's Pride Week events. By July 2017 he had done two high fashion model shoots with fashion photographer Aaron Williams for Out magazine. In September 2017 Desmond joined drag performer RuPaul to cut the ceremonial ribbon opening the inaugural RuPaul's DragCon NYC. He also hosted \\"a children's walk off on the runway\\". In October 2017, Desmond announced the \\"Haus of Amazing\\", the first drag club for children and young adults under the age of 20. In February 2018, Desmond made his runway debut at the fall 2018 Gypsy Sport show, wearing a black blazer with ruffles.

On September 1, 2018, he performed at the rebooted Wigstock festival celebrating drag performance. He also appeared in the associated HBO documentary Wig. In September 2018, Desmond walked the runway in The Blonds' Disney villain-themed 2019 Spring/Summer collection; he portrayed Maleficent. Also during New York Fashion Week, he took part with Gays Against Guns protesting gun violence in schools. In November 2018, he was named to Out magazine's Out100, \\"founded to celebrate and honor some of the most influential LGBTQIA figures\\". Later that month, he appeared on the television program GMA Day alongside drag queens Hedda Lettuce, Alyssa Edwards, and Shannel. Desmond's GMA appearance was the inspiration for Greg Howard's Middle School's a Drag: You Better Werk! (2020) young adult fiction book that starts with Desmond's quote, \\"Be yourself always\\". He is also the inspiration for the young gay eight grader drag kid character, Julian, and his drag persona Coco Caliente Mistress of Madness and Mayhem. He also did a fashion campaign for SPKTRM Beauty. And he was featured in gender neutral makeup brand Fluide's campaigns. In 2018 Dazed named him #27 of the Dazed100, a list of the hundred most influential people shaping youth culture. = 2019‚Äì2020 = In 2019 Desmond became one of a group of LGBT activists to be named spokespeople for Converse. Out magazine notes Desmond has also faced backlash, and has described these criticisms and attacks as \\"blatant homophobia and transphobia\\". In March 2019 he acted in Marti Gould Cummings' parody video of \\"Baby Shark\\". In March 2019 Desmond was a featured speaker and performer at \\"This Is Me\\", the 26th Our True Colors youth conference for sexual minority youth and families at University of Connecticut-Storrs. He led a workshop, \\"Desmond is Amazing: A Drag retrospective\\". In spring of 2019 Desmond was runner up for the Queerties Up & Coming award for \\"the best in LGBTQ culture and media\\". In early June 2019 he served as Grand Marshal of the 23rd Annual Brooklyn Pride Parade. He also returned to the Children's Museum of the Arts as an ambassador for their 3rd annual Pride Cultural Festival. In June 2019 he also appeared in Broadway Sings for Pride's concert \\"Fearless\\" benefiting New York City area LGBT organizations. As of June 2019, he has appeared in Vogue four times. In June 2019 he was featured in Advocate's pictorial fashion shoot commemorating NYC Pride. In summer 2019 he was nominated for the 11th annual Shorty Awards, to \\"honor the best people and organizations on social media\\", in the category of LGBTQ+ Account. In September 2019, Desmond was named as one of the headliners of Drag Expo taking place in Melbourne (Victoria, Australia) in August 2020. In March 2020, Desmond was one of the featured LGBTQ+ people in the coffee table book Closet Cases: Queers on What We Wear, edited by Megan Volpert on Et Alia Press. In May, Desmond released Be Amazing: A History of Pride, with illustrations by Dylan Glynn. In July he presented his book as part of a virtual Drag Queen Story Hour streamed for Portland, Oregon. Public image In 2019 when asked about his drag inspirations Desmond replied: He describes his drag aesthetic as androgynous, avant-garde, club kid, and colorful. Some of his costumes and makeup looks have been patterned after LGBT icons such as Madonna, Gloria Swanson, and Divine. El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya and The Feed have described Napoles as the most famous drag kid in the world, and Los Replicantes states he is the youngest professional drag queen in the world. Desmond's status as a child drag performer has drawn criticism from social conservatives for the perceived sexualization of a child. Following his performance at age eight during the 2015 NYC Pride Parade, The family was defended by psychotherapist Michael LaSala, who rejected the notion that his performance was due to parental influence. LaSala stated that children that young were unlikely to act contrary to social norms simply due to parental instruction. Desmond has a manager and a Child Performer's Permit from the New York State Department of Labor, and is registered in California as a child actor. Desmond's youth limits his opportunities to perform: most drag events are held in nightclubs or other age-restricted venues. He prefers to be called a 'drag kid' rather than 'drag queen' saying the latter should be reserved for adults. In December 2018, during an appearance at the 3 Dollar Bill, a gay nightclub, Desmond removed an outer layer of clothing to reveal a crop-top and accepted tips from the audience. Conservative and pro-life websites characterized the performance as stripping. According to his mother, the performance prompted more than a hundred reports of child abuse filed with child protective services agencies, and the Napoles family has received death threats. His mother stated that, as of August 2019, his is the \\"most investigated case [the agencies] had ever received. It even went to the governor's office.\\" She said that it took government resources away from abused children that needed help. His mother said the criticism was \\"blatant homophobia\\" and a \\"display of the grossly outdated belief that gay men are pedophiles\\". In February 2019, BBC Minute reported on Desmond and interviewed his manager mother who stated \\"as a parent, if your child wants to do drag, that's fine\\" and said drag kids are \\"not doing adult drag... they're doing a more kid appropriate version of drag.\\" When pressed about the nightclub performance, she said that he was \\"carefully supervised\\" and \\"in accordance with the Dept. for Labor's regulations for child performers.\\" Charles Dunst in The Atlantic posited that the fierce reaction against Desmond and other non- heteronormative kids was due to U.S. culture only accepting queerness in legal adults. Dunst stated that \\"society presumes queerness to be inherently sexual, adults think that a preteen who plays up his gender nonconformity could not possibly be doing so voluntarily\\". According to Dunst, there are very few safe spaces for LGBTQ children to express themselves. Desmond has spoken publicly on LGBTQ issues at Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teen Vogues 2018 Summit, GLSEN Respect Awards, Children's Museum of the Arts, and the New York City Commission on Human Rights.  Notable drag performances  In June 2018 he made his runway debut in the 2018 New York Fashion Week Gypsy Sport show runway. Also in June 2018, Pride month in New York City, he performed at a number of events including Upright Citizens Brigade, NYC Pride's youth event, NYC Pride's PrideFest, and the Phluid Project. In June 2018, Napoles performed at a Pride cultural event at the Children's Museum of the Arts in New York City. In the same month he performed in the Tyler Clementi Foundation benefit \\"Sing for Pride\\" to prevent suicide among LGBT youth, and in that summer, he acted in the Independent film Pageant Material, a teen drag film about drag pageants, in which he portrays Young Rodney alongside Mayhem Miller. In September 2018, he performed at the rebooted Wigstock festival celebrating drag performance. He is also part of the Wig documentary of the event which aired on HBO.

His work often depicted working-class people and environments, especially those of Northern England. Born into a working-class family, Hilton worked as a plasterer and was an active member of the plasterer‚Äôs union and the National Unemployed Workers‚Äô Movement. After attending classes with the Workers Educational Association, he published his first book, the autobiographical Caliban Shrieks, in 1935. Hilton then attended Ruskin College, and eventually published a number of both fiction and nonfiction texts. He was acquainted with fellow working-class author Jack Common, socialist literary editor John Middleton Murry, and George Orwell.  Life  = Early life = Hilton was born in Oldham but lived most of his life in and around Rochdale. Although his mother had many children, only four lived to adulthood. Hilton began working at an early age: at nine he worked before and after school as a ‚Äúbarber‚Äôs lather boy and later as a grocer‚Äôs errand boy.‚Äù At twelve, he worked half time at a cotton mill as a ‚Äúdoffer‚Äù ‚Äì a term used for young boys who replenished the spindles used by the older weavers.Hilton, Jack. ‚ÄúThe Plasterer‚Äôs Life.‚Äù Seven Shifts. Ed. Jack Common. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1938. He left school at fourteen and worked various jobs until joining the army at sixteen. During the war he was injured in France, at which point he returned to Rochdale and became a plasterer. He remained a plasterer for the rest of his life and was an active member of the plasterer‚Äôs union, which he joined in 1924. In June 1922, he married Mary Jane Parrott, a cotton mill worker. Mary would continue to work in local cotton mills for the duration of their marriage. = Authorship = Hilton was often unemployed during the depression of the 1930s, and during this time he joined the Workers‚Äô Educational Association, where he began writing under the mentorship of W. H. Mason. At this time he was also active in the National Unemployed Workers‚Äô Movement, and was arrested at a NUWM demonstration. He was held in prison for twelve days, then released on the condition that he not speak in public for three years. During this time of enforced silence, he finished his first book, Caliban Shrieks, which was published in 1935 by Cobden Sanderson. He then attended Ruskin College for two years on a Cassel scholarship. In late 1937 and early 1938, he published a series of autobiographical essays in The Adelphi, a literary journal edited by John Middleton Murry. 1938 also saw the publication of his first novel, Champion, by Johnathan Cape. The obituary for Hilton's brother, Stanley, killed at sea in 1941. Hilton is mentioned as a \\"well known local author.\\" In 1938, Hilton was approached by Johnathan Cape about writing a travel narrative, offering him a ¬£50 advance to fund the trip and ¬£50 upon completion of his book. Hilton accepted the proposal, and in May of that year he and his wife Mary packed their belongings in a large pram and spent six months walking through ‚Äúnorthern and midland industrial regions and cities such as Sheffield, Leicester, the Potteries and Birmingham; the home counties by way of Epsom and Buckinghamshire; and Bristol, Stroud and Devon in the west country.‚Äù Throughout the journey they visited working-class districts and interviewed workers in various industries about their working and living conditions. The couple camped in a tent on the side of the road, occasionally staying in the homes of fellow union members. The couple returned to Rochdale in October 1938, at which time Jack wrote up his notes from their journey. His account of their trip was published in 1940 as English Ways: A Walk from the Pennines to Epsom Downs in 1939. After writing English Ways, Hilton returned to fiction, publishing his second novel, Laugh at Polonius; or Yet, There is Woman in 1942. His youngest brother, Stanley Hilton, died at sea in 1941, when the trawler Arctic Trapper, on which he was a stoker, was attacked by German planes and foundered. After the war, Hilton struggled to get his work published. Nevertheless, he continued writing throughout his life and published short stories and essays in magazines whenever possible.Clarke, Ben. ‚ÄúGeorge Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.‚Äù Review of English Studies 67.281 (2016) 764-785. In 1949 he was hired to re-walk the same trip he took for English Ways and report on the ‚Äúchanges and improvements in post-war Labour Britain.‚Äù The resulting book, English Ribbon, was published in 1950; it would be his last major publication. = Later life = Hilton‚Äôs father, George Hilton, died in 1952, and his wife Mary died on 11 February 1955. He married his second wife, Beatrice Alice Bezzant on 14 July 1956. Neither marriage produced children.

JH/1/1/24/. http://mss- cat.nottingham.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id;=JH%2f1%2f1%2f24&pos;=23 Although he was partially responsible for Orwell's visit to Wigan, Hilton was not impressed by the Road to Wigan Pier. In his unpublished autobiography Caliban Boswelling, Hilton criticized the book, claiming that although Orwell ‚Äúwent to Wigan‚Ä¶he might well have stayed away‚Äù as he only ‚Äúwasted money, energy and wrote piffle.‚Äù Hilton claimed that Orwell ‚Äúwanted to get at the pith but didn‚Äôt know how, and failed,‚Äù and as a result he produced ‚Äúcolour that wasn‚Äôt worth the paint mixes.‚Äù He blamed Orwell‚Äôs failure partially on his inability to blend in with the working-class communities he visited, being a \\"tall, ex-officer type, Eton, modest, non-hard-boozing, non hard cursing, non crude gamestering, no locale in the dialect sense.‚Äù Despite this disagreement, Orwell and Hilton continued corresponding and reading each other's work. \\"Orwell reviewed English Ways enthusiastically in the Adelphi in 1940 and discussed Hilton‚Äôs work with Desmond Hawkins in ‚ÄòThe Proletarian Writer‚Äô, broadcast by the BBC in the same year and reprinted in The Listener.\\" He repeatedly attempted to get Hilton's work published, introducing him to publishers and readers when he could.  Further reading  An archive of Hilton‚Äôs work and papers is held at Nottingham University Libraries. A description of the archive holding can be found at Archives Hub. Middlesex Polytechnic History Journal published a special issue on Hilton in 1985. It includes essays by Andy Croft, Dan Charlton, Clive Flea, and others, and contains a sample chapter of Caliban Shrieks. In addition to writing an article for the Middlesex Polytechnic special issue, Andy Croft mentions Hilton in his book Red Letter Days: British Fiction in the 1930s. Hilton also features in a chapter of Working-Class Writing: Theory and Practice. The Review of English Studies has published one article on Hilton and his relationship to George Orwell. After Hilton‚Äôs death, Croft advertised in the Rochdale Observer hoping to find any living relatives of Hilton‚Äôs, but was unsuccessful. More recently, other scholars have tried to find the copyright holder for Hilton's works so they can be republished.

Work  Critic Robert Rosenblum called Ippolito's inaugural exhibition at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery \\"a notable event,\\" writing that \\"his canvases present abstract analogies to a landscape vision, suggesting earth, horizon line and sky; yet the separate realms of land and air are most often fused together in a single coloristic unity.\\" Reviewing his later work, artist-critic Fairfield Porter described him as one of the few abstract artists \\"who uses brilliant color as his material instead of something to dress the painting up with.\\"Irving Sandler, \\"Angelo Ippolito: A Retrospective Exhibition,\\" Binghamton University Art Museum, 2003, p. 10.

In the 1970s his paintings became more expansive and bright-hued, prompting critic Hilton Kramer to write, \\"the pleasure of color remains his primary concern, and he is a virtuoso in the handling of it.

Biography  Hanna Farah was born in village of Alijiah in 1960, to a Palestinian family who displaced from Kfar Bar‚Äôam. Many of his works, photograph, print and sculpture which deal with the history of the village and attempts to resettle it. He is an artist but, also engaged in architecture and design at the same time, between 1996 and 2008 he worked on the \\"New Kufer Bir'im\\" project, and designed the exhibition of Hila Lulu Lin at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (2005). The name of the Kufer Bir'im was added to his signature as a second family name, in order to tie his identity to the village of his family, whose residents were expelled from it in 1948. The affair of the displaced people of Akrit and Bir'im was discussed extensively in the government, the Supreme Court and the Knesset, but has not yet been implemented to fulfill the promise given to the residents that they will be able to return to their villages. The addition of the name symbolizes the \\"indivisible identity between his geographical and physical origins and his mental location.\\" = Art career = Farah deals with the idea of the biography of the place as a distorted, irregular and detached narrative, which no retrospective look can reconstruct or correct. \\"Disrupted\\" (2003) series, in which he created a biographical mosaic of geographically disintegrated spaces that lies between the Kfar Bi‚Äôram and the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, where the Farah lives now. In his co-operated work with artist Dina Shoham, Block (2002), the two artists appear in their work restraints, facing each other and building gray blocks, each around himself, like a fence or a wall that is rising around them. The two walls become two buildings that bury and imprison the artists. The background soundtrack of the work includes a conversation between the two artists who reflect on the Jewish-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian question as local narratives, so that the dissonance between the walls that are visible on the video and the relaxed conversation that is heard in the background is felt more strongly. In the early photo work of a flower, there is a typical point of view: it is low, as foot-level of observer, trying to trace the place from which material and information were taken or to reveal hidden content or deviate from the agreed logic. In later photographs, the perspective expanded - it embraces an outside or an inside of space, looking horizontally or diagonally, in a way that draws inspiration from the catalog or police photography genre. In his solo exhibition \\"Concerns (◊ó◊©◊©◊ï◊™)\\" (2014), a flower presented as photographs taken randomly, documenting his daily life, events and scenes from the social and material environment in his life, thus forming a kind of personal visual biography of the artist. In the exhibition, he brought photographs of different times and types together - a kind of re-activation of the works through cross-language cross-word making and a matchmaking of photographs placed side by side as an unresolved puzzle. Despite his meticulous aesthetics, Farah's works transverse categories and undermine the boundaries between media, bodywork and performance, conceptual documentation and photography. Another feature of Farah's work is the cross- referencing between what is in the case and what is intentionally created. For example, in \\"Shelter 5-1\\" (2007), Farah was asked to take refuge in the building and prepare him for daily use. After the evacuation of the place and during its cleaning, one of the walls revealed the inscription \\"Palestine\\" apparently written by a Palestinian worker who was present at the site. In the framework of the work he painted the wall and painted it white while simultaneously documenting the process of doing all its stages. As part of his temporary invitation to work for the exhibition (2007), he was asked to return and reveal the inscription on the wall. The study raises questions such as the issue of the labor force in Israel in general and especially in the field of construction, and the fact that it is impossible to disconnect the political from the public sphere. = Repairing model = Bar'am is a fundamental experience for Farah, he testified that \\"I often start out as a simple cube, reminiscent of my grandfather's house.\\" In his work, \\"A Model for Repair\\" (2010), Farah builds Bar‚Äôam on its ruins by models, etchings, various actions, video works and photographs, creating an imagined space that simultaneously coexists as memory and dream and as an explicit and practical proposal for return. Farah 's move joins a long list of community, private, artistic and legal projects initiated and initiators by the people of Kfar Bar‚Äôam in order to fight the displacement of the village' s remains and promote to return to it. In this work, Farah analyzes the remains of the historic village and proposes planning for the future development of the place, attesting to a certain utopian dimension in his work and his perception. In the first stage of the work - mapping - Farah observes British and Israeli aerial photographs made for intelligence and military purposes and extracts the movement of the village, as well as its continuation, from a statement that \\"I see a photograph of life, I see the life there was and the life that can be.\\" Later, from the aerial photographs and the testimonies he collected, Farah reconstructs the village structure - a intimate core of houses built close to each other, mostly around a common courtyard, with plots of land owned by the residents scattered around the village at different distances. In the model that he built for the future development of the village, he reconstructs the route of the village and the relationship between the buildings and the agricultural lands, and locates the future residential area around the historical village center, so that the remnants of the old village exist within and as part of the new village. The agricultural lands and the industrial buildings appear in the model in the second and third circles around the built-up circle of the village. According to the proposal in the village nucleus it is suggested to place the community and cultural center of the new village. Despite the circumstances of the limiting reality, Farah's proposal marks a concrete possibility both for the construction of a village and for a political settlement in which refugees will return to the places from which they were ejected or to other places to which they would return. = Education = * 2001-2002 ‚Äì Bachelor of Architecture, Architecture Department, WIZO College of Design, Haifa * 1996-2001 ‚Äì Bachelor of Science, WIZO College of Design, Haifa * 1988-1996 ‚Äì Certified Art Teacher, Art Teacher Diploma Program, WIZO College of Design, Haifa * 1988 ‚Äì Preservation Specialist, Italy = Prizes and grant = * 2007 ‚Äì Prize to Encourage Creativity, The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport * 2003 ‚Äì Pais Lottery grant for Kufer Birim Project = Selected group shows = * 2011 ‚Äì Towards Return of Palestinian Refugees, Zochrot Gallery, Tel Aviv- Jaffa * 2010‚Äì Stop Making Sense, Oslo, Oslo Kunstforening/Oslo Fine Art Society * 2009 ‚Äì For the tree of the field is man's life, * 2009 ‚Äì Espace culturel Memoire de I'Avenir, Paris * 2009 ‚Äì The Thousand and One Nights, Postmasters Gallery, NYC, NY * 2009 ‚Äì Landsc¬Æape: Representation Matrixes, Petach Tikva Museum of Art, Petach Tikva * 2008 ‚Äì Correspondence Contemporary Arab Artists, Revealing another Reality, * 2008 ‚Äì The Museum for Islamic Art, Jerusalem * 2008 ‚Äì The Jerusalem show, Al Ma'mal Foundation for Contemporary Art, Jerusalem * 2008 ‚Äì Prizes in Art and Design from the Ministry of Science' Culture and Sport, 2007, * 2008 ‚Äì Haifa Museum of Art * 2007 ‚Äì Temporally, The Israeli Center for Digital Art, Holon * 2007 ‚Äì Wanderings in the Print Space, The Print Workshop, Jerusalem * 2007 ‚Äì Desert Generation, The Kibbutz Art Gallery, Tel Aviv * 2007 ‚Äì See Not\\\\ Fear Not, Umm el- Fahem Art Gallery, Umm el- Fahem * 2006 ‚Äì Bread, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * 2006 ‚Äì Mini Israel, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * 2006 ‚Äì Biographies, Six Solo Exhibitions, Hagar Art Gallery, Jaffa * 2005 ‚Äì Play- Ground, ‚ÄòBeit Hagefen‚Äô The Arab-Jewish Center, Haifa * 2004 ‚Äì Utopia, ‚ÄòBeit Hagefen‚Äô The Arab-Jewish Center, Haifa * 2003 ‚Äì Officespace: Art on Site 2, 16 Ha Arba‚Äôah Street, Tel Aviv * 2003 ‚Äì Israeli Object - A Matter of Time, Artists‚Äô House, Jerusalem; Science Museum, Haifa * 2003 ‚Äì Black/White, Beit Hagefen, Haifa; Artists‚Äô House, Jerusalem; Science Museum, Haifa * 2003 ‚Äì The Situation Now - the book, 40 authors‚Äô and artists‚Äô perspective on the * 2003 ‚Äì current events in Israel, Kinneret Publication * 2003 ‚Äì Platform Against the War, Jaffa Cultural Center, Jaffa * 2003 ‚Äì Young Graduates/Veteran Graduates, The New Gallery, WIZO College of Design, Haifa * 2001 ‚Äì Improvisation, The Escola Design Gallery, Tel Aviv * 2000 ‚Äì Israeli Design, Ganei Hata‚Äôarucha [Exhibition Grounds], Tel Aviv * 1998 ‚Äì The Shadow, The Ministry of Culture and Education, Jerusalem  References  Category:Living people Category:1960 births Category:Palestinian artists ","title":"Hanna Farah-Kufer Bir'im"},{"id":"58003198","text":"Fabrice Daniel Hartmann (born 2 March 2001) is a German footballer who plays as a winger for RB Leipzig.

The novel features the Motswana protagonist Precious Ramotswe, commonly addressed as Mma Ramotswe throughout the series. Mma Ramotswe is based in Gaborone, Botswana and has set up the first and only detective agency in the country.  Plot summary  Mma Makutsi has decided to start a new venture: The Handsome Man's De Luxe Caf√©. She envisages this to be place for fashionable men to hobnob, and in her excitement ignores the various warning signs, even when alerted by her husband Phuti Radiphuti and her idol and boss Mma Ramotswe. To run the caf√©, she ends up hiring her lawyer's family, all of whom have a track record of being unreliable. To make the matters worse, her nemesis Violet Sephotho, who is now a restaurant critic, spares no mean words in her review published in the leading national daily. Mma Potokwani helps by suggesting a complete change in the positioning and branding. She also offers to help run the caf√© by offering one of her best housemothers as the manager. The business of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, run by Mr J L B Matekoni, is shrinking. To manage the finances, he fires his apprentice Charlie, who is visibly shaken by the change of events. Out of compassion, Mma Ramotswe hires him for the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. An Indian family comes to meet Mma Ramotswe to find the identity of an Indian lady who apparently landed at their doorstep out of nowhere and cannot remember her identity. During the investigation, Mma Ramotswe discovers that the lady was harassed by her husband in South Africa and ran away. The husband managed to get police to charge her with attempt to murder. To protect her from her husband and from deportation, the family is giving her shelter and allowing her to feign amnesia. Mma Ramotswe is in a dilemma; if she writes the truth in her report, the lady will once again be at the mercy of her husband, and if she does not, she would be misleading the national authorities who are dependent on her report to decide the future course of action. Mma Potokwani calls an old friend, who is now a senior police official in South Africa, to check the matter impartially and get the lady's name off the wanted list for murder, which resolves her problem.

Reviews  This novel was well regarded as carrying forward the world of ideal philosophy, kindness and humor established by its predecessors. The Washington Times in its review found the story-line to be \\"vintage McCall Smith\\" with abundant philosophy and humor. The Sunday Times said \\"Forget the library - the body is in the mud hut. An African Miss Marple created by a Scottish lawyer ... superb\\". Kirkus Reviews considers the plot to use a deus ex machina, Orphan Farm matron Mma Potokwane to resolve the problems, but \\"all‚Äôs well that ends well in perhaps the most tranquil and unruffled entry in this renowned series.\\" South China Morning Post likened this novel to the previous novels that mix gentle humor with Botswana culture.

Although he appears in a number of different stories, he is best known as the loyal companion of the culture hero Amirani. His name means \\"black-ear\\", a common Georgian name for dogs. He was said to be born of either a raven or an eagle, and is sometimes depicted as having eagles wings as a result. Apart from his wings, Q'ursha was sometimes described with other special features: colossal paws, \\"lips of gold, and eyes as big as sieves\\". He was attributed supernatural abilities such as a thunderous bark, a leap \\"as big as a great field\\" and an infallible ability to track prey. Q'ursha was the subject of the popular Georgian folk song \\"O my Kursha!\\", which dates back to at least the 18th century. The Georgian poet Davit Guramishvili, born in 1705, wrote of a desire to hear it again, in a poem describing his youth. There are at least twenty-seven documented versions of the song.  Companions  Amirani, as a national Georgian hero, is the most prominent mythological figure associated with Q'ursha. As the son of the mountain goddess Dali and a mortal hunter, he was a demigod of enormous strength. He traveled the earth challenging \\"demons and dragons alike,\\" until he decides that there are no worthy opponents left for him and issues a challenge to God himself. God chains him to a pole inside a mountain for his defiance, and his faithful hound Q'ursha is trapped along with him. Q'ursha licks Amirani's chains constantly, weakening them more and more until Amirani is almost able to escape. However, every year they would be renewed just before Q'ursha could free Amirani. The hunter Betkil was another man said to be accompanied by Q'ursha. Unlike Amirani, Betkil was merely a mortal. The goddess Dali took him as her lover, but when he betrayed her trust by sleeping with a mortal woman, she lured him to the top of a mountain in revenge. He becomes trapped there with Q'ursha. In some versions of the story, Betkil sends Q'ursha for help, and Q'ursha returns with villagers. The villagers throw ropes, but the mountain grows taller and Bektil falls to his death. In other versions of the Betkil story, Q'ursha insists that the starving Betkil kill and eat him. Betkil kills Q'ursha and prepares a fire with his bow and arrows, but in the end, cannot bring himself to eat the dog. Some sources refer to Q'ursha as a companion of Dali, but he is more commonly associated with hunters.

Kimball a native and resident of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was the author of Hymns, (Boston, 1866); Swallow Flights of Song, (1874). Her hymns included:‚Äî At times on Tabor's height (Faith arid Joy), Dear Lord, to Thee alone (Lent), It is an easy thing to say. (Humble Service), We have no tears, Thou wilt not dry (Affliction). She appeared in the Poets of Portsmouth (1864), and the Unitarian Hymns of the Spirit (1864), and others. Several of Kimball's poems were included in Robert Hall Baynes' The Illustrated Book of Sacred Poems. ‚ÄúThe Poetess of the Church‚Äù as she was long called, Kimball's life was largely devoted to literature and to church work. She was one of that group of nineteenth-century poets of which Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was most prominent and which ministered so greatly to the American love of poetry and appreciation of it that the members of the group were in some sense literary pioneers. Kimball was the last of the group to survive. Early years and education Harriet McEwen Kimball was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on November 2, 1834. She is a daughter of Dr. David Kimball and Caroline Rebecca Swett. She was a delicate child, and her education was given to her in her own home, mainly by her cultured and accomplished mother. Kimball began to write at an early age, and her work was criticised by her parents, who encouraged her to develop and exercise her poetic gift. Career Kimball was interested in charitable work throughout her life, and Portsmouth Cottage Hospital is one of the monuments that attest to her philanthropy. She was an active church member. In all her literary work, she was careful and painstaking. Her first volume of verse was published in 1867. In 1874, she published her Swallow Flights of Song, and in 1879, The Blessed Company of All Faithful People. In 1889, her poems were brought out in a full and complete edition. Most of her poems were religious in character. Many of them were hymns, and they were included in all church collections of the late 19th-century. Her devotional poems were models of their kind, and her work was considered unique in its rather difficult field. She lived in Portsmouth, devoted to her literary work, and her religious and philanthropic interests. Personal life She was a friend of John Greenleaf Whittier. She died on September 3, 1917, at her home in Portsmouth, and was buried at Harmony Grove Cemetery, in the same city.

Background =Fallout between Boisrond-Canal and Domingue= Haitian general and senator Pierre Th√©oma Boisrond-Canal was among the band of young leaders who in 1869 successfully ousted the former Haitian President Sylvain Salnave from power. The following year, Boisrond-Canal retired from the military to his farm in Fr√®res, a short distance from P√©tionville, and was elected to the Senate of Haiti. General Michel Domingue was elected president in 1874, and yielded success in securing a treaty of friendship with the Dominican Republic, but Haiti's domestic financial situation was devastating. Domingue tried to negotiate a loan with France, which would strain Haitian finances for years. As a result, corruption and fraud were so great that Boisrond-Canal publicly criticized this financial policy and the loan. To distract the public, Domingue issued a decree, dated May 15, 1875, for the arrests of Generals Brice, Pierre Monplaisir Pierre, and Boisrond-Canal, alleging that the three were plotting a conspiracy against his government. According to Jacques Nicolas L√©ger: > Monplaisir Pierre, with gun in hand, met the soldiers who were sent to > arrest him; he made an energetic resistance and in defending the entrance to > his house was killed in the fight which ensued; Brice, who had also made a > brave defense, was successful in reaching the Spanish Consulate, where he > died from the effects of a bullet wound in the thigh. Boisrond Canal, who > was living on his plantation at Fr√®res, a short distance from P√©tionville, > was fortunate enough to be able to make his escape before the arrival of > those who were commissioned to arrest him, and sought shelter in the United > States Legation, which was then situated at Turgeau, a suburb of Port-au- > Prince. =Bassett= Ebenezer Bassett was in his sixth year serving as the United States' fourth ambassador to Haiti and the first African-American ever appointed as an ambassador for the country. The affair Canal and two young relatives arrived at Bassett's home, seeking protection and refuge. The diplomat agreed to protect them under his diplomatic immunity. \\"It may be that the instinct for humanity got the better of me,\\" he later wrote to Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. \\"The men before me were not my personal friends. They had never visited my house before, nor I theirs. I had no merely personal interest in them.\\" The crisis dragged on for several days before Bassett could write to Washington. Reflecting on the issue, Bassett wrote a 21-page dispatch to the Secretary of State. He was optimistic that the government's persecution would ease. He had dealt with numerous cases of refugees in the past, and although some took weeks to resolve, the diplomat had always been successful. He was worried about the government threat. \\"I must confess that the presence of a thousand armed men around my country residence‚Ä¶with discontent stamped on their faces and Henry rifles in their hands does not quite give the best possible ground to my hope,\\" he wrote to Fish. Fish criticized his Minister for taking in refugees. He responded to Bassett by noting that the Haitian Ambassador to Washington, Stephen Preston, had complained about the refugees. Fish wanted to resolve the problem quickly. He did not force his envoy to hand over the refugees, however. Despite incurring the wrath of his superiors in Washington, Bassett put all of his credibility on the line: As a result of the standoff, Bassett's home remained surrounded by over 1,000 soldiers. The nightly rhythm of loud taunts and screams, beating of metal objects, and general nuisance kept the family huddled inside trying to gain a few hours of restless sleep. Bassett first raised the idea of sending a U.S. warship to Haiti in his May 8 despatch first reporting the incident. He argued at the time that such a show of force would exert \\"a wholesome influence\\" and strengthen \\"our own moral force\\" in resolving the matter. As the conflict dragged on for weeks, with both Bassett and Domingue digging in their heels, Washington seemed paralyzed. The diplomat continued to plea for a warship through the summer. But Fish's pique at his Minister and his continued discussions with Preston, who lobbied hard against sending a ship, left the situation unresolved. In spite of the displeasure he caused in both capitals, Bassett was seen as a hero by supporters among the Haitian people. The affair energized popular opinion in favor of the United States and raised Canal as a folk hero. \\"The prevailing sentiment is unmistakably in favor of [Canal], and in our favor, because we have firmly protected him against violence,\\" Bassett wrote. No doubt part of that support for both Canal and Bassett was because of the brutality with which the regime continued to act against any and all presumed opponents. Political arrests and killings continued, and Bassett concluded, \\"the awful fact stares me in the face that we are all under a reign of terror.\\" =Breakthrough= By summer's end, it looked as if Secretary Fish had finally had enough. Perhaps a more visible threat, he concluded, would cause the Domingue regime to crack. \\"It has been determined to apply to the Navy Department to order a man of war to Port-au-Prince with a view to your protection from insult,\\" Fish wrote to Bassett. \\"That the embarrassing question adverted to may be satisfactorily adjusted before she arrives, is much to be desired.\\" As the ship was preparing to leave, Haitian Ambassador Preston rushed to tell Fish that Domingue was ready to capitulate. Bassett could escort Canal safely out if the warship would turn back and not enter Haitian waters. Fish agreed and instructed Bassett that a deal had been set. He was relieved to receive the news. Finally, just after midnight on October 5, 1875, Canal embraced Bassett and boarded an American-flagged ship, to sail to Jamaica and safety. As a refugee, Canal had been essentially held captive by the government threat for more than five months. After his departure, Bassett telegrammed the Department of State informing them that the crisis had finally passed: \\"Refugees amicable embarked and soldiers withdrawn from around my premises yesterday.\\" Aftermath After a few weeks, Boisrond-Canal returned to Jamaica, where his relationship with Domingue improved so much that he was appointed commander of the army in the Ouest department by President Michel Domingue. On 23 April 1876, Boisrond-Canal replaced Michel Domingue as the first president of the provisional government, before becoming President of Haiti non-provisionally on 17 July 1876. Domingue went into exile in Kingston, Jamaica, where he died a year later. Boisrond-Canal would serve in three separate instances as president of Haiti, significantly influencing politics prior to the U.S. invasion in 1915. Bassett would leave his post as U.S. ambassador to Haiti upon the end of the Grant administration in 1877, as was customary with a change of hands in government. In spite of any lingering resentment that may have existed in Washington because of his defiant stance, it was impossible for the Department not to recognize Bassett's work. Bassett and his family boarded the boat Atlas on December 1, 1877 for the two-week trip to New York City, and Boisrond-Canal was present at the reception to wish Bassett farewell. He was succeeded by John Mercer Langston, another African- American who had established and served as the dean of Howard University's law school and who would later serve as the first black representative from Virginia. Bassett himself would later be appointed by Haitian president Lysius Salomon as Haiti's Consul General for New York City, in which Bassett would serve for ten years. Bassett would also assist Frederick Douglass, a fellow abolitionist who would also later serve for a short time as U.S. ambassador to Haiti. Septimus Rameau, a relative of Domingue's who was appointed as vice- president and was widely seen as the power behind Domingue's presidency, was accused of being responsible for the deaths of the two generals. He was himself assassinated on a street in Port-au-Prince in 1876.

History  Northeast Maritime Institute was founded in 1981 as the Tidewater School of Navigation, Inc. in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The school originally provided only continuing education courses and programs approved by the United States Coast Guard prior to becoming a college. In 1997 the school was renamed Northeast Maritime Institute and later moved its location to Fairhaven, Massachusetts where its main campus building is located today. Since its relocation the school has grown to four campus buildings all within walking distance and located within the center of Fairhaven. In 2008, the Institute launched The Fairhaven Project through a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of State to advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine. The program brought groups of Israeli and Palestinian students to Fairhaven where they would work together onboard the brigantine tall ship m/s Fritha. A 30-minute documentary of the 2008 program was created and utilized by U.S. Embassies and Consulates in the Middle East and other regions of conflict to stimulate student discussions and extend a message of equality and understanding to a larger audience. Northeast Maritime Institute delivers a range of on-line maritime education and training programs through its Learning Management System ‚ÄúNEMO¬∞‚Äù (also called Northeast Maritime Online). The online education and training system was designed so that seafarers could complete training at sea rather than during their shore leave. In 2018, Northeast Maritime Institute entered into a partnership program with the University of Virgin Islands for development of a degree program in maritime management.  Academic programs  = Nautical science = The Institute‚Äôs College of Nautical Science is a merchant marine college intended to prepare students to work onboard ships as deck officers and captains upon graduation. In addition to completing all shore-side college classes, students are required to complete two ‚ÄúSemesters at Sea‚Äù whereby they work onboard U.S. flagged commercial vessels. Students may elect to complete their Semesters at Sea onboard any vessel that meets program requirements.

Smith is an American epidemiologist and science communicator. She is a professor at the Kent State University College of Public Health who studies zoonotic infections. Smith was the first to identify strains of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus associated with livestock in the United States.  Early life and education  Smith has a Bachelor of Science in biology from Yale University. She earned her PhD in microbiology at the University of Toledo, where she investigated Streptococcus pyogenes. She completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Michigan.  Career  In 2004 Smith joined the University of Iowa College of Public Health. She has received over $3 million in research funding, primarily from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, United States Department of Agriculture and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Smith identified that 45% of pig farmers and 49% of hogs farmers carried Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She went on to identify that almost 40% of people with MRSA contain the strain associated with livestock. The work was described as one of the most comprehensive investigations into the spread of MRSA by the journal Nature. She is distinguishing the Staphylococcus aureus strains around Iowa City, by characterizing the DNA around several places in the genome. She compared strains related to ST398, a sequence type that is associated with livestock but not expected to cause infection, from around the world. She found that meat that is sold with the claim it contains no antibiotics contains the highest levels of the garden-type of S. aureus. Her research has been covered by The New York Times. Smith has also studied and written about vaccine hesitancy. She joined the Kent State University College of Public Health in 2013 as an associate professor. In 2015 Smith was appointed an American Society for Microbiology Distinguished Lecturer. In 2017 she became a full professor at Kent State. Her light-hearted Christmas contribution to the British Medical Journal on the likelihood of a Zombie apocalypse was covered extensively in the mainstream media. Following the Zika virus outbreak, Smith wrote several articles to provide advice for members of the public. She went on to use zombies to demonstrate how diseases were spread. Smith has written books on Ebola virus, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae. In late February 2020 the Wall Street Journal called her \\"a prominent infectious- disease specialist\\" when reporting on her tweet criticizing the White House's attempt to control messaging about the novel coronavirus outbreak. = Public engagement = Smith takes part in several initiatives to improve the public understanding of science. She writes a regular column for Self. She has been writing the popular science blog Aetiology since 2005, and was one of the first scientists to start blogging. Her research has appeared in the popular science books Pig Tales: An Omnivore's Quest for Sustainable Meat and Superbug: the Fatal Menace of MRSA. She has featured on podcasts, including Science for the People, Talk Nerdy and the Meet the Microbiologist podcast of the American Society for Microbiology.

Origin \\"The Full Catastrophe\\" first occurs in the 1964 film Zorba the Greek. It is spoken by the character Zorba (played by Anthony Quinn), a colorful Greek with a zest for life. Zorba has insinuated himself into the employ of Basil (Alan Bates), a bookish Englishman who has inherited a mine in Crete. In a boat on their way to the island, Basil asks Zorba if he is married. Zorba laments, in accented English, \\"Am I not a man? And is not a man stupid? I'm a man, so I'm married. Wife, children, house--everything. The full catastrophe.\\" The English screenplay, written by the film's Greek Cypriot director Michael Cacoyannis, is based on the 1946 novel of the same title by Nikos Kazantzakis. The phrase \\"the full catastrophe\\" does not actually occur in the novel, but the screenplay dialogue above blends and condenses the language of two distinct scenes in the novel. In the first, the narrator, having just met Zorba, asks him if he is married. Zorba: \\"Aren't I a man? I mean blind. Like everyone else before me, I fell headlong into the ditch. I married. I took the road downhill. I became head of a family, I built a house, I had children--trouble!\\" Kazantzakis, Nikos. Zorba the Greek. Translated by Peter Bien. Simon & Schuster, 2014.Later, when Basil asks Zorba how many times he has been married, he responds, \\"What are you delving into now? D'you think I'm not a man? Like everyone else, I've committed the Great Folly. That's what I call marriage--may married folk forgive me! Yes, I've committed the Great Folly--I've married!\\" In a 2011 interview, Cacoyannis, who was fluent in English, said that in writing the script he consciously chose the non- idiomatic expression \\"the full catastrophe\\" for Zorba for the sake of ‚Äúhumor and impact.‚Äù Use in popular culture \\"The full catastrophe\\" in uses after the film most commonly refers to the stresses of marriage and family life, but it has been used in broader senses as well. *The Full Catastrophe is the title of a comic novel by David Carkeet, published in 1990, which focuses on verbal strife in marriage. A play adaptation of the novel by Michael Weller bears the same title; the play premiered in 2015. *Full Catastrophe Living, also published in 1990, is a best-selling guide to reducing stress, written by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The book redefines Zorba's \\"full catastrophe\\" as something positive, an affirmation of life's variety and chaos to be embraced, not lamented. *\\"The Full Catastrophe\\" is the title of a song by American rock singer/composer John Mellencamp in his 1996 album Mr. Happy Go Lucky, in his 1999 collection Rough Harvest, and in his 2010 boxed set On the Rural Route 7609. *Full Catastrophe Living is the title of a 2009 poetry collection by the American poet Zach Savich. The book won the 2008 Iowa Poetry Prize. *In 2012, the American folk duo The Nields titled a song and album The Full Catastrophe. *The 2015 British sitcom Catastrophe, starring Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, draws its title from the Zorba quote. *The Full Catastrophe is the title of a 2015 nonfiction book by James Angelos about Greek culture with emphasis on the country's recent debt crisis. *The Full Catastrophe is the title of a 2016 memoir by Karen Elizabeth Lee.

The adult female copepod clings to the fish's gills or skin and feeds on its body fluids. Taxonomy Pennella exocoeti was first described by the Danish zoologist Hans Severin Holten in 1802 from a specimen probably found on the mirrorwing flyingfish (Hirundichthys speculiger). He called it a \\"gill worm\\" and recognised that it had close affinities with Chondracanthus merluccii, another \\"gill worm\\" found on a member of the cod family Gadidae, but he did not realise they were both copepods. Another species was described by the French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur as Pennella blainvilli from the tropical two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus volitans), but that has since been determined to be a synonym of P. exocoeti. Description This is a large copepod that may grow to a length of . The mature female found attached to its host bears little resemblance to a free-living copepod. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing the host's cuticle and sucking fluids, the second antennae are modified with hooked claws for gripping the host, and the other appendages are vestigial. The body gradually widens towards the posterior and has transverse bands of dark colour. The body terminates with an egg sac and a pair of very long setae (bristles). Ecology The adult female copepod is parasitic while the adult male is free-living. The head and neck of the female burrow into the host fish and large, hard cysts are formed in the host's organs. The attachment is made by hooking to the fish with the prehensile second antennae, the remaining parts of the copepod's body hanging free. This copepod is in its turn often parasitised by a goose barnacle, Conchoderma virgatum.

History Pro made his fortune as a pirate cruising the Indian Ocean against Moorish shipping, possibly alongside David Williams or Thomas Collins. They returned to the pirate trading post at Ile Ste Marie off the Madagascar coast to divide their treasure. Adam Baldridge had abandoned the settlement in 1697 after a Malagasy uprising, but Pro remained behind to rebuild. In 1703 Williams and Collins were captured by fellow ex-pirate Aert Van Tuyl after they and the crew of Thomas Howard‚Äôs ship Prosperous got into a fight with Van Tuyl and his native allies. Escaping six months later, Williams made his way to Pro‚Äôs outpost. The following year the Royal Navy warships Severn and Scarborough sailed the region on a mission to eliminate piracy. Williams and Pro were captured but escaped shortly afterward, sailing canoes to Mohilla, Johanna, Mayotte, and finally back to Methelage (Messelege) on Madagascar. Afterwards Williams (and possibly Pro) sailed with Thomas White for a time, but they were not among the crew who disembarked at Don Mascarenas to retire from piracy. By 1707 Pro had returned to Ile Ste Marie, leading the settlement with support of the Malagasy natives. With support from other pirates such as Samuel Burgess he made a business of slave trading. Pro charged trading fees to pirates and merchants who came looking to buy slaves cheaper than they could from the Royal African Company. Collins left to run a similar pirate outpost at Port Dauphin, which he took over after the death of its previous leader, former pirate Abraham Samuel. In 1717 Pro was visited by Robert Drury, a castaway sailor who survived the wreck of the Degrave in 1701 and had been living among the Malagasy ever since. Drury later write a memoir of his time on Madagascar and described Pro and his lifestyle in detail: > One was a Dutchman, named John Pro, who spoke good English. He was dressed > in a short coat with broad plate buttons, and other things agreeable, but > without shoes or stockings. In his sash stuck a brace of pistols, and one in > his hand. ‚Ä¶ John Pro lived in a very handsome manner. His house was > furnished with pewter dishes, &c.;, a standing bed with curtains, and other > things of that nature except chairs, but a chest or two served for that use > well enough. He had one house on purpose for his cook-room and cook-slave's > lodging, storehouse, and summer-house; all these enclosed in a palisade, as > the great men's houses are in this country, for he was rich, and had many > cattle and slaves. ‚Ä¶ I being interpreter, we settled the manner of trade, > and then the captain made presents of a gun or two, &c.;, and the king > presented him with a slave, &c.; He also gave me a girl of twelve years old, > which I sold immediately to John Pro.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Lundin Peak is situated three miles north of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Originally called Snoqualmie Little Sister, the peak's name was changed in 1931 to honor district forest ranger John Lundin. Lundin Peak is a high point on a ridge located midway between Snoqualmie Mountain and Red Mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate Lundin Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.Lundin Peak in winter Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Lundin Peak from Snoqualmie Pass The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

She is one of the most prominent performance artists in Israel and her performances have been exhibited in Israel and abroad in festivals, theaters, galleries, museums, shelter 209 and in performance stage. Co-founder of the Dan Zackheim 209 Shelter for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Art in Israel Founder and Artistic Director of the Performance and Ensemble Stage 209.  Biography  Tamar Raban, painter and sculptor, was born in 1955, Haifa. During the years 1979‚Äì1982 Raban studied art and Hebrew literature at the University of Haifa, and later studied video art at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem, from 1983 to 1986. Raban's daughter, Noa Knoller, is an actress and theater director.  Art career  In 1988, Raban was one of the founders of the Dan Zackheim 209 Shelter for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Art in Israel, and in 2001 she founded the 209 Ensemble and the Performance Stage, and in 2006 she founded the ZAZ Festival, an international performance art festival. She is currently the Artistic Director of Performance Stage, Ensemble 209 and the ZAZ Festival. In addition, she teaches performance art in schools and art academies and the School of Visual Theater. She is the moderator of workshops for performance art, post-modern theater and post-drama in Israel and abroad. Her first painting work, which is evident in the visual presence and the integration of visual images in the videos that she includes in her works. During she studied at the University of Haifa, Raban experienced a significant encounter with the work of artist Motti Mizrahi, who performed at the university at that time, and understood that this is a way of expression that interests her. Raban's final project in her studies was the performance \\"Mirror Mirror\\", which was also presented in 1982 at the Biennale of Young Artists in Haifa; Raban referred to her work at this stage as a kind of living and complex painting. Later she moved to Tel Aviv and participated in various art events in that time, such as the Rothschild Sculpture Exhibition (1984) and the Acre Theater Festival. After the show \\"Birds Hanging in the Square\\" at the Israel Festival, where she performed with a group of participants (1988), she began working with her friends in Ensemble 209 in a shelter she received from the municipality to use as a studio. The place became a space for permanent work by the ensemble members in the field of performance and video art.Schreiber, Michal, Shelter 209 ‚Äì 1988‚Äì1994, historiographic research on the activities of a group of Israeli performance artists, thesis for Tel Aviv University, 2016, electronic copy. (in Hebrew) Raban's work outright as they do about the artist and reality. Over the years, they have shrunk in the number of participants, over time and space they occupy, creating an increasing density of expression. Around the exhibition \\"Installation ‚Äì Documentation ‚Äì Performance+\\" (1994) Raban expressed the crisis she experienced in relation to art and objects: They add to her ever waste are ecologically, and that they lose their function and meaning when experienced in the consciousness of the viewer or the context of the work were complete. In this exhibition, and as a direct continuation of her personal experience in the \\"Life-Life\\" exhibition she presented the previous year, Raban began to examine her attitude toward objects and art and move closer to the field of performance.Exhibition, Curator: Danny Zakheim, Tamar Raban and Anat Shan, Tel Aviv: Dan Zackheim 209 Shelter for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Art in Israel, 7 October 1994 ‚Äì 4 November 1994 (in Hebrew) Raban's works are among the only plain and the many plain as tension underlying conflicts between work and receipts derived from other contrasts: between automatic and repetitive and chaotic and threatening; Between industrialized and natural and human; Between the cruel and the innocent. It shows how the forces of destruction that are singular, and plural may permeate each other and mingle without separation. For example, the work \\"Self-altar\\" at the Janco Dada Museum (1991), drained her blood in front of the crowd, then pumped to the sink altar, self-destructive act which raised a victim of the artist herself. Thus, the work describes the artist as the god, the worshiper and the victim together in a closed circle that has no outlet, unless the artist has stopped him. = Ensemble 209 and installation stage = In 2001, the Ensemble 209 group moved from a shelter to a space in Beit Merkazim in southern Tel Aviv, which was burned down in 2003, and in March 2004 its activity was transferred to the new Central Bus Station. Then established \\"Stage Performance\\" (Performance Art Platform), rooted in the shelter 209, and which is a space dedicated to the field of performance art in general and in particular Raban's work and is under the artistic direction. The common denominator of the three spaces in which Ensemble 209 and Matza performed are that they are not theater spaces in the original, but rather alternative spaces. Although some of Raban's works in the performance stage are not directly related to the space of the central bus station, the location of the performance stage in the central bus station is of artistic and social significance to her.Aharonson-Lehavi, Sharon, Gender and Feminism in the Modern Theater, Raanana: The Open University, 2013 (in Hebrew) Raban herself wrote that \\"the central bus station, which serves as a microcosm of cultural and margins as the abode of the company, a source of inspiration for me.\\"◊®◊ë◊ü, ◊™◊û◊®, ◊î◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊î◊™◊®◊û◊ï◊ì◊ô◊†◊û◊ô ◊î◊©◊†◊ô / ◊ê◊†◊°◊û◊ë◊ú 209, ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë: ◊ë◊û◊™ ◊û◊ô◊¶◊í- ◊ë◊û◊î ◊ú◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ô◊¶◊í, ◊°◊ì◊†◊î ◊ï◊û◊®◊õ◊ñ ◊û◊ó◊ß◊®, 2005.

(in Hebrew) Raban appears in almost all of her works in a performance stage and creates a stage character that is herself and also a unique figure for the show. Her performances deal with questions of identity and are based on gestures and actions that take on significance during the performance itself.

One day, Lilker gifted Scott a bass, so that he could learn the instrument and join an early iteration of Anthrax. When Scott wasn't using the instrument, Craig would begin to teach himself how to play it. Within the next two years, Craig Setari would progress to listening to hardcore punk.

The show premiered on September 2, 2018, following the finale of Kamen Rider Build, joining Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger and later, the miniseries Super Sentai Strongest Battle, followed by Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger in the Super Hero Time line-up. The series has a time travel/multiverse motif while paying a tribute to all of the previous Heisei-era Kamen Riders, due to being a spiritual sequel to Kamen Rider Decade. The series and related films also feature returning actors reprising their roles from the previous Heisei series. Plot Sogo Tokiwa, a high school senior born in the year 2000, dreams of one day becoming a king. Suddenly, he meets a mysterious girl named Tsukuyomi, who has come from the year 2068 with an ominous warning: \\"You will become Kamen Rider Zi-O, the King of Time; the demon destined to rule the world.\\" Despite being troubled by his potential fate, Sogo becomes Kamen Rider Zi-O in order to save the space-time continuum from the Time Jackers, a group seeking to alter the history of the Heisei Kamen Riders for their own ends. He is aided in his quest by Geiz Myokoin, a resistance fighter from 2068 capable of becoming Kamen Rider Geiz who initially intended to kill Sogo to prevent his future tyranny, and a self- titled prophet named Woz, who wants the youth to become the tyrant Ohma Zi-O, who later gains the power to become Kamen Rider Woz. Along their journey, Sogo and his friends meet several Kamen Riders from the past and their allies; earning their trust and obtaining their powers. Following his high school graduation, Sogo discovers that Swartz, the Time Jackers' leader, is actually Tsukuyomi's older brother and was manipulating both the Riders and his fellow Jackers in his plan to fuse the entirety of the Kamen Rider multiverse into a single, unified world in order to destroy it and save his world. Despite their best efforts, Sogo and his allies fail to stop Swartz until the former accepts his destiny and becomes Ohma Zi-O to destroy him. Instead of taking control of the world as it was foretold he would do however, Sogo renounces his powers in order to undo Swartz's damage; creating a new reality where he lives in peace with Geiz, Tsukuyomi, and the other Time Jackers.

The route operated between 1989 and 1990 as a pilot route. The route was created as part of a settlement with the local Chamber of Commerce. Due to low ridership the route was discontinued. This route was operated under the New York City Transit brand. Route description and service The Q99 route started at the Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer subway station and bus terminal. From there service went east on Archer Avenue, north on 168th Street, east on 88th Avenue, before turning north on 169th Street. Buses then turned west onto Hillside Avenue to reach the terminal at the 169th Street subway station. At the terminal, transfers were available to many bus routes. Buses returning to Jamaica Center turned south on Merrick Boulevard, passing into the 165th Street Bus Terminal and back onto Merrick Boulevard, before heading west on Archer Avenue, north on 153rd Street, west on Jamaica Avenue, south on 150th Street, before turning east on Archer Avenue to reach the terminal. Service was operated between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturdays, and between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays. Service ran every 15 minutes on weekdays and Saturdays, and every 20 minutes on Sundays. History Service began on March 12, 1989 in response to an out-of-court settlement brought by the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce. The settlement was brought since merchants near the 169th Street station lost significant business with the rerouting of several bus routes along Merrick Boulevard to a new terminal at the Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer subway station. The bus route was put into service on a trial basis with the hope of getting Merrick Boulevard bus riders to patronize the businesses near 169th Street. The settlement called for a minimum one-year trial of the Q99, and turning Archer Avenue and Jamaica Avenue into a one-way pair as a strategy to keep buses running past the shops. The modification of these two streets to a one-way pair required buses to do difficult turns, costing up to $1 million in delays and doubling bus accidents in the area. The Jamaica Chamber of Commerce reported that 14 new stores opened since the change, and the DOT said that it liked the change, a review of which was due in April 1991. The bus route duplicated existing service and had extremely low ridership, with an average of only four passengers per trip. The fares only covered 7% of the route's cost, well below the MTA Board's guidelines of 68%. As a result, the New York City Transit Authority held a public hearing on June 25, 1990 to hear comments about its plan to discontinue service on the route. Five riders attended the hearing and spoke out against the change, and a TA official stated that \\"Those were probably all of its riders.\\" The Q17 had already connected the Merrick Boulevard corridor and the Hillside Avenue corridor, while the Q30 and Q31 had connected the Archer Avenue Line with the Hillside Avenue corridor. The Q17 already had the transfer privileges that the Q99 had. On August 17, 1990, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board's Transit Authority Committee extended these transfer privileges to the Q30 and Q31. A count completed in summer 1990 found that 212 riders used the Q99's 53 trips, about four riders per trip. Many of these riders were students with discount passes. Service was discontinued on September 9, 1990 because it was, in the words of Norman Silverman, the TA's director of surface transit planning, \\"a bus with no riders.\\" He did not think that the route would succeed. The bus' operation cost $420,000, or $280,000 a year. The route operated for 18 months, twice the length of typical TA experimental routes, and Sid Davidoff, who lobbied for the bus' creation on behalf of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, stated that it never asked that it be kept for 18 months.

Raised in late 1862, the 1st Delaware Cavalry Battalion was initially to be raised as the 1st Delaware Cavalry Regiment, but was reduced to a battalion due to the inability of the state to fill a cavalry regiment to full strength. It served on provost duty in Maryland and Delaware from 1863 to early 1864, and fought in the Action at Westminster known as Corbit's Charge during the Gettysburg Campaign. It participated in the Overland Campaign in June 1864, then returned to Maryland after the Confederate cavalry raid of Jubal Early. It remained there for the remainder of the war, and was mustered out after its end.  History  The first attempts to raise cavalry units for active service in Delaware were made by Napoleon Bonaparte Knight, who was authorized to raise a battalion of four companies on 13 August 1862. Delaware politician George P. Fisher was commissioned by the War Department to raise a 1,200-man cavalry regiment, including Knight's battalion, on 9 September. Due to the small population of the state, the regiment could not be expanded to the projected strength, with only seven understrength companies out of a typical ten being raised. It ultimately served as a four-company battalion. Between late 1862 and early 1863 it trained at Camp Smithers near Wilmington at Brandywine Hundred. Knight (on horseback) in Westminster before Corbit's Charge The regiment was organized at Wilmington on 20 January 1863, attached to the 1st Separate Brigade of VIII Corps in the Middle Department. It mustered in with a strength of 568, including 24 officers. The 1st Delaware Cavalry served at Wilmington until June, when it transferred to the Cavalry Reserve of the Defenses of Baltimore. The regiment was on provost duty in and near Baltimore for the next year, and elements of it fought in the Action at Westminster (Corbit's Charge) on 28 June; this was its first combat. It was transferred to the 3rd Separate Brigade of the corps in October, and returned to the Cavalry Reserve in December. Companies A and D remained in the District of Delaware until December, while Companies D and E remained in that state until March 1864, after which Company E was stationed at Havre de Grace in April. The regiment transferred back to the 3rd Separate Brigade in March, and was ordered to join the Army of the Potomac to fight in the Overland Campaign on 15 May. Upon reporting to the army on 5 June, the regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of VI Corps. It fought in the Battle of Cold Harbor between 5 and 12 June and the Siege of Petersburg between 17 June and 10 July. During the latter, it participated in the Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road between 22 and 23 June and the First Battle of Ream's Station on 29 June. With VI Corps, the regiment moved north to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in pursuit of Confederate cavalry commander Jubal Early between 10 and 12 July, guarding the corps Artillery Brigade. On 14 July the regiment, excluding Company A, was ordered to Baltimore, where it rejoined the 1st Separate Brigade of VIII Corps. Company A remained with the Army of the Potomac to guard the VI Corps Reserve Artillery until rejoining the regiment in September. The regiment served on picket and outpost duty along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and guarded fords of the Potomac River between Georgetown and Point of Rocks until November, when it briefly returned to Delaware for the United States presidential election. Operating in Montgomery County between 7 and 11 October, the regiment continued to serve on the Upper Potomac and on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio. By March 1865, the regimental headquarters was at Monocacy Junction with detachments at Baltimore and Annapolis, among others. In mid-April its detachments helped in the search for the Booth conspirators, one of whom, George Atzerodt, was captured by a squad led by Sergeant Zachariah W. Gimmell on 20 April, and brought to the Relay House camp. The detachments at Relay House were mustered out on 6 June, followed by those at Baltimore on 30 June. During its service, the regiment lost two enlisted men killed in action, while two officers and 47 enlisted men died of disease. It mustered out with a strength of 363, including eleven officers.

During the strike, that was held on the same day as the fast of Tisha B'Av, many organizations and companies allowed their employees to be absent to participate in the many protest events that were held throughout the day across the country, including Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beersheba, Ra'anana and other cities. The strike was the first LGBT strike in history.  Background  Protesters in the main rally in Rabin Square. The sign translates into \\"2nd class citizen\\". The literal translation of the sign is \\"type B citizen\\", with the \\"B\\" also being used in the Hebrew equivalent of the LGBT acronym. Strike leaders on the main stage. From left to right: Roni Belenki, Ran Shalhavi, Yarden Brikman, Chen Arieli, Ohad Hizki Following a Supreme Court case regarding the Israeli Surrogacy Law that was legislated in 1997, appealing to include gay couples in the law, the State's response to the court was that the law will be amended. To make the appropriate changes, the government formed several professional health committees, such as the Mor- Yosef committee, that passed along its recommendations to Minister of Health, Yael German. After the 34th government was formed, headed by Benjamin Netanyahu, this issue was discussed in the Knesset's Labour, Welfare, and Health Committee headed by Eli Alaluf. In the proceedings to bring the bill to a second and third reading, the committee voted to add single women to the bill, while still excluding single men and gay couples from using surrogacy. The bill was brought to its second and third reading on July 18, 2018, with reservations, including one by Amir Ohana of the Likud Party, adding single men to the bill. Because of the stance declared by the ultra-orthodox factions in the coalition, headed by the United Torah Judaism, the coalition decided to oppose the reservation while supporting the original amendment. Prior to the vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a video to his Facebook page, explaining that he will support a future amendment to the bill that will be brought by MK Ohana during the Knesset's Winter Session, to allow single men to use surrogacy in Israel, but despite his support, he voted against Ohana's reservation. The Knesset than passed the amended bill in its original form with 59 for and 52 against. Other pressing issues during that time were several lesbian couples who are fighting for the state's recognition of their joint parenthood, and in at least one case that went public, 2 women found out that they were unilaterally removed as the second parents from their children's birth certificates. Even before the vote, on July 14 and July 17, demonstrations against it were held in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem. On July 19, protesters walked to the government office building in Tel Aviv. Around the same time, on July 17, a sex worker trans woman was stabbed in her apartment in south Tel Aviv.  Planning  As a result of the vote on the bill and the reservation, The Aguda called members of the LGBT community to strike on Sunday, July 22 (Sunday being the first workday in Israel). The roots for this strike were planted a year prior to that, in a cooperation of LGBT organizations in the country. The idea started rolling after a protest in July 2017, which brought around 15,000 protesters against the Ministry of Welfare's stance in a Supreme Court hearing regarding adoption by same-sex couple. In a position paper presented to court, the ministry claimed that same-sex parents are \\"anomalous\\" and therefore cannot become adoptive families. After receiving a lot of public pressure, welfare minister Haim Katz announced that he plans on changing the ministry's stance on this issue. In order to plan the strike, many PR and advertising agencies and journalists were contacted to pressure companies in Israel to prepare for a future strike. When the new surrogacy law passed in the Knesset, to include only single women but not single men or gay couples, in a way perceived as discriminatory, the LGBT organizations, headed by the Aguda, decided to implement the strike plan immediately. The organizers contacted CEO's and prominent public figures and asked them to join the strike and have their companies and organizations publish their support. Most of them agreed, though some in some cases they gave their support after being told by the organizers that their lack of support will be made public on media and on social media. An Israeli economic publication, The Marker, posted a list of companies that refused to support the strike. = Corporate sector's support = Many Israeli companies and workers unions announced that they will allow their employees to strike in order to attend the protests, without risking their jobs or deducting their pay. In the few days before the strike, more than 250 publicly and privately own businesses announced their support for LGBT equality, and allowed their employees to stay home in order to strike and attend the protests. Some of the companies allowed their employees to use a personal day or an elective day, while some gave the employees a paid one-day leave. One of the first companies to join the strike was Microsoft Israel, that later announced that it will give its employees a grant if they choose and need to use surrogacy outside the country. The companies that supported were from various sectors: law firms, restaurants, architecture firms, communication providers, travel agencies and hi-tech companies, along with big public and government sector organizations, including Ben Gurion Airport, Haifa and Ashdod ports, El-Al and Israir, Teva, Tnuva, cellphone, landline, cable and satellite providers, municipalities, hospitals and emergency services, food chains and supermarkets, banks, credit card companies and more. This was the biggest ever support by businesses for a social cause in Israel, and the first LGBT strike in the world. Israel's Workers' Union, the Histadrut, issued a statement that is supports both the protest and the strike, and called employers in the public and private sector to allow employees to strike without harming their rights.  Protest events  During the day of the strike, some 1000 strikers in Tel Aviv demonstrated and marched from the government office building on HaShalom Intersection, through Ayalon Highway to Rothschild Boulevard, where a field studio was built, broadcasting live interviews throughout the day. In Jerusalem's France (Paris) Square, outside the Prime Minister's official residence, 250 protesters demonstrated and blocked roads. The police detained 3 demonstrators only to release them later that day. More demonstrations were held around the country ‚Äì in Haifa's main road, the entrance to Karmiel and other major junctions across the country. Roads were blocked by protesters in several cities, some of them were main city roads. Around 1000 protesters blocked HaShalom intersection and marched down to the highway, chanting about equality for all, social justice and government-backed discrimination. Protesters also blocked roads in other cities; In a demonstration on Ragher avenue, the main road in Beersheba, a driver tried running over a protester. The end of the protest day was marked with a march in Florentin in south Tel Aviv, supporting the transgender community, following an attempted murder of a trans woman sex worker a few days prior. This attack was the peak of many transphobic acts of violence in Israel. The march ended in the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, a location known as a center of prostitution, and was attended by around 6000 people, making it the largest transgender demonstration in Israel, to date. = Rabin Square rally = The strike day, along with its demonstrations and protests against anti-LGBT discrimination and violence, culminated in a rally in Rabin Square in central Tel Aviv. According to police estimate, between 80,000 and 100,000 people attended that rally. The rally was hosted by TV presenters Lucy Aharish and Nadav Borenstein, and among the speakers were former parliament member and longtime human rights activist Yael Dayan, actress Orna Banai, and Orly and Ravit Weiselberg-Tzur, who were to appear in front of the Supreme Court the next day in their case pleading to register both of them as their son's parents. Many artists also performed at the rally, like Rita, Dana International, Ilay Botner, Ran Danker, Korin Alal, Rona Kenan and others. All main Israeli broadcast networks dedicated a major part of their programs to the strike, and broadcast live from different demonstrations across Israel, from the strike headquarters in Rothschild Avenue and from the rally in Rabin Square.

He initially worked for the Republic of Venice and from 1574 was employed by the Spanish Empire. Lantzas was involved in various plots to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greek-inhabited regions. In 1608 he devised a plan for the assassination of the Ottoman Sultan by placing a present containing explosives in front of him. Early years Petros Lantzas was born on the island of Corfu, then part of the Republic of Venice (but now in Greece). During the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573 he supported the rebellion of Emmanuel Mormoris in Ottoman-ruled Epirus. As such, Lantzas made preparatory skirmishes and raided Turkish ships in the regions of Lepanto and Preveza. He also attacked inland regions and penetrated as far as Delvin√´.Chasiotis, 1970, p.93 At the end of the war (1573) he was appointed governor of the coastal town of Parga, opposite of Corfu, by the Venetians.Lubin, 2012, p. 135: \\"Pietro or Petros Lantzas, described in the sources as a Greek, who had served as the Venetian governor of Parga in 1573 ...the crime that he did.\\" However, in 1574 Lantzas was dismissed from office and banished by the Venetian authorities. Though the reason for this turn of events is not clear, an anonymous letter sent to the local Venetian provveditore (governor-general) alleged that Lantzas was ostensibly buying munitions from the Spanish to allow the locals to defend themselves against the Turks, but according to the letter he was in fact selling these munitions to the Turks for his own profit. The letter goes on to ask for Lantzas to be assassinated. Meanwhile, being unhappy with the Venetian‚ÄìOttoman peace settlement, he transferred to Spanish service. He served the Viceroy of Naples and became a notable member of the Greek community of Naples.Safa, 2012, p. 228 In Spanish service Venice decided to sue for a unilateral peace with the Ottomans in 1573. As a result, the Greek collaborators of the Venetians and their agents in Corfu and the Ottoman Empire turned to the Kingdom of Naples, then part of the Spanish Empire. On the other hand, Spain actively encouraged insurrections against the Ottoman Empire and acceded to the petitions of a number of rebels and potential rebels.Lubin, 2012, p. 165 In the following years Lantzas served the Spanish as a corsair and spy. In July 1576 he went to Himara, where the local population was willing to raise a revolt against Ottoman rule.Vakalopoulos, 2003, p. 84 As part of this Lantzas, together with the rebels from Himara, led an attack against the nearby Ottoman fortress of Sopot, but did not meet with success. Lantzas' assignment was to supervise the military movements of the Ottomans, as well as those of the Venetians, and to direct the shipment of weapons, provisions, spies, and saboteurs who were sent repeatedly to Epirus, the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, and other parts of the Ottoman Empire. He led pirate raids against Ottoman ships, while from 1577 he began attacking Venetian ships, thus creating diplomatic tensions between Habsburg Spain and Venice.Safa, 2012, p. 419 This activity aroused the wrath of Venice, which attempted to assassinate him.Hassiotis, 1969. p. 285 As a result of this activity Lantzas was dismissed from his post as the captain of the royal frigates in 1578, though he continued to serve the Viceroys of Naples until the first decade of the 17th century. In 1578, under the guidance of Lantzas, plans were proposed to the Viceroy of Naples and the Spanish king Philip II for a military intervention in favor of a Greek insurrection in Cyprus, which had been occupied by the Ottomans since 1571.Hassiotis, 1969. p. 286 In August 1596 Lantzas supported another revolt in Himara led by the archbishop of Ohrid, Athanasios Rizeas.Vakalopoulos, 2003, p. 83: \\"Œ†Œ¨ŒΩœÑœâœÇ ŒøŒπ ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±œÅœáŒπŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÉŒØŒøœÖ œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ≠Œ∫œÅŒ∑ŒæŒ∑ ŒΩŒ≠ŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (ŒëœçŒ≥ŒøœÖœÉœÑŒøœÇ 1596), œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøŒµœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒøœÄŒøŒØŒøœÖ œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒµ Œ∂œâŒ∑œÅŒ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œø Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒõŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ∂Œ±œÇ.

In 1608 he devised a plan to assassinate the Ottoman Sultan by placing a present containing explosives in front of him.Safa, 2012, p. 114Safa, 2012, p. 419: \\"Similarly, the Corphiote Pietro Lanza served the Viceroys of Naples for many years as a corsair and spy. After many years in service, he even offered, at a very old age, an interesting plan, worthy of the caliber of this seasoned corsair. He would go to Constantinople and engage in a number of clandestine operations including the assassination of the Ottoman Sultan with a fake present in whose lower part there would be explosives.\\" Lantzas died in 1608 during a trip to Ragusa on the Adriatic shore.

It lies 67 kilometres south of Chifeng and 150 kilometres north east of Chengde, location of the Imperial Mountain Resort. Currently, it houses the Wangfu museum related to the Qing times. History The Ka La Qin princes were hereditary princes of Mongolian nobility, Khalkha Mongols and governing the Kalaqin banner, which is the current Harqin Banner. They were living nomadic before they constructed the palace as their main residence during the reign of Kangxi Emperor in 1679. Through marriage the princely family became related to the imperial Qing dynasty. The prince's descendants occupied the mansion until the 20th century. The last and twelfth prince was Gungsangnorbu, an important politician and reformer in Mongolia and China. He was born in the palace in 1872 and spent here his childhood. Within the palace grounds, there is a large bronze statue remembering him. After World War II, the local government was stationed in the palace in 1945. Thereafter, it housed a school since 1948, which moved out in 1997. It was listed as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 2001. The local government decided to restore the palace and turn it into a museum, which opened in 2002. It was rated AAAA Tourist Attractions of China (4A) in 2008. Structure The complex has a size of 40,000 square metres. The lay-out is symmetrically east-west, has five courtyards and is strictly in accordance with the princely rank, stipulating size and such in Qing dynasty architecture. Within the grounds, there is also a garden and various Buddhist temples. After the construction in 1679, it was continuously expanded by the Ka La Qin princes.

It was executive produced by Taika Waititi. The film is about two women cynical about love, who run an agency that helps break couples up. The film was released in New Zealand on 3 May 2018 and internationally on Netflix (excluding New Zealand and Australia) on 15 February 2019. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and was a box office hit in New Zealand. Plot Jen and Mel run \\"The Breaker Upperers\\", an agency in Auckland for people who need help breaking up with their significant others. They use unorthodox means to help their clients, such as impersonating police officers to inform a woman, Anna, that her husband has died and that his body has gone missing (though the latter is merely hiding in the agency's car). During their twenties, the two women befriended each other after discovering that their then-boyfriend, Joe, had been cheating on both of them. Although Mel has moved on, Jen remains obsessed with Joe, who has moved back into town with his wife and children. Mel becomes infatuated with Jordan, a seventeen-year-old client who is afraid to break up with his fearsome girlfriend, Sepa. The attraction is mutual, much to Jen's hesitance. The three meet with Sepa and her gang to break up the couple; Sepa does not take the news well and punches Jen in the face. After the incident, Mel and Jordan begin dating. One day, Jen and Mel re-encounter Anna, who still believes that her husband's body is missing and that the two women are police officers. Anna and Mel soon become friends due to their many shared interests, which annoys Jen and makes her feel left out. Eventually, Anna begs the two women to provide her with access to her husband's file. Jen and Mel, who are dressed as police officers, attempt to continue the charade by taking Anna on a tour through the local police station. Their plot is revealed when a real officer mistakes them for being strippers and requests a lap dance. After providing the lap dance, a shocked Anna storms out of the station. Mel apologises and explains that Anna's husband had hired them. Anna does not forgive them; she is furious and states that what the two women are doing is wrong and that many people have been hurt by their actions. Mel takes Anna's words to heart and considers leaving the agency, infuriating Jen, who sees nothing wrong with what they are doing. Their friendship is further complicated when Jen blames Mel for causing her breakup with Joe many years ago. Despite being reminded that Joe had hurt the both of them, Jen cuts Mel from her life. Mel leaves the agency. Jen contacts Joe and they meet up for dinner at a restaurant. She declares her long-time love for him and states that he is \\"the one\\". Initially believing that she is joking, Joe laughs at her. He reveals that he had cheated on her with not only Mel, but with several other women as well. Joe rebuffs Jen by stating that although he was unfaithful in his youth, he has since grown up. Meanwhile, Mel continues to date Jordan. Although he is a kind and caring person, she realises that due to his youth, Jordan remains naive and childish. He is also still in love with Sepa, who had been supportive of his budding rugby career. When Jen runs into Mel at the shops, the latter reveals that she is pregnant. She wishes to keep the baby, but is unsure of her relationship with Jordan. Jen enlists the help of Sepa, who is still in love with Jordan. At the local pub, Jordan is being publicly congratulated on his recent contract to play rugby with the Gold Coast Titans. Mel is also in attendance, and she appears worried when Jordan states that he is willing to forfeit the contract to stay with her and the baby. Sepa and her gang arrive at the pub with Jen. Sepa grabs the microphone and declares her love for Jordan, apologising for her confrontational personality and stating that she knows she needs to soften her behaviour. Sepa and her gang sing for Jordan, while Jen sings to Mel about their friendship. Mel then gently breaks up with Jordan, encouraging him to go back to Sepa and accept the rugby contract. She also assures him that she and their baby will come and visit him as often as possible. Satisfied with her support, Jordan reunites with Sepa. Jen and Mel make amends, with Jen promising to be there for her friend and support her through motherhood. In the end credits, Jen and Mel have since rebranded their agency to help clients with \\"make-ups and break-ups\\". They are seen reuniting couples, including those who had previously used the agency for break-ups. Anna has forgiven Mel and the two resume their friendship. Jordan has moved to the Gold Coast and is seen happily playing with his infant daughter.

This album is one of the most popular ones of Joaqu√≠n Sabina's discography and also marked and before and after in the career of the singer. Unexpectedly, the sales of this album reached another record in the trajectory of the performer outselling Hotel dulce hotel, which was, till then, his best selling album.  Background  In 1992, after having released some successful albums, Sabina had already stablished himself as one of the most creative and recognised Spanish performers. His popularity in Latin Am√©rica was also on the rise with some tours and performances in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where he had an enormous fanbase. The singer found the inspiration for this album in some personal or sentimental experiences and some other day-to-day stories. Some of the songs of the tracklist of the album are also inspired in the life and the experiences of some of his friends, and in some cases, frienemies. In this album the performer confessed to have turned into the antihero of his own songs, which was criticised by some intellectuals such as Antonio Mu√±oz Molina, however, the performer admitted that it couldn't avoid it. Joaqu√≠n Sabina had turned into someone who was loved by many, but also hated by many others due to the message of some of his songs and his clear and sometime harmful opinions. The initial title of this album was going to be \\"Verdades como pu√±os\\"(Truths like fists), as a response of the title of his previous record, however, in the ende title of the release was changed to F√≠sica y qu√≠mica, a phrase which was inspired by a famous sentence said by the Spanish Physician Severo Ochoa, who said textually that \\"Love is physics and chemistry\\". As an interesting fact, in the cover photo of this release appears Sabina with a painted beard emulating Groucho Marx.  Style and production  As usual, Joaqu√≠n Sabina teamed up with his friends and longtime producers, Pancho Varona and Antonio Garc√≠a de Diego, who had collaborated in some of his previous releases. The rock spirit of his recent releases is present in all the tracklist, although some songs were influenced by other styles. The album starts with \\"Y nos dieron las diez\\" (We went on till ten o'clock), the first single and also the most popular song. This track, which features a heavy Mexican traditional vibes, talks about a summer love story during a tour. The protagonist fell in love with the waitress of a bar but one year later, when he returns to the same city, the main character discovers that everything that he appreciated had disappeared. This song, for which was released a promotional video, turned into a smash hit both in Spain and Latin America, specially in Mexico, where this song has not only been covered by other artists, but also has been usually performed by famous Mariachi bands. The second song of the tracklist, entitled \\"Conductores suicidas\\" (Suicide drivers) which shows a more rock sound, talks about the descent to the world of addictions and excesses of an unspecified popular Spanish singer in the last 1980s and early 1990s. In this song, Sabina talks about a friendship that was abruptly ended because of those problems. Some years later, the performer confessed that he was referring to Manolo Tena, who although was still very popular, he had a growing problem with drug abuse. The following song of this album, surrounded by a blues atmosphere, was \\"Yo quiero ser una chica almodovar\\" (I want to be an Almodovar girl), a song dedicated to the awarded Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar and all the actresses who had participated in his films such as Carmen Maura, Rossi de Palma and Victoria Abril amongst others. The song not only reflects Sabina's admiration for Almodovar's movies, but also makes chained references to the titles of those films, such as; Dark Habits, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, High heels and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. The following track and second single of this album was the intimal and passionate ballad \\"A la orilla de la chimenea\\" (By the edge of the fireplace) which also received a very favourable critical and commercial response. Another song, the third maxi single extracted from this album, which has te title of \\"Todos menos t√∫\\"(Everyone but you) describes with huge detail the vibrant nightlife of Madrid and all the varied types of people that one can see in the Spanish capital city; from \\"That kind of hairdressers who are known as stylists\\" to \\"lascivious divorced women with Madonna styled hair\\". The fourth single of this album was \\"La del pirata cojo\\" (The life of the crippled pirate), in which the singer invites his audience to live different lives far away from the ordinary stories. A very different subject matter has the fifth single, entitled \\"Peor para el sol\\" (Worse for the sun), in which the performer describes an infidelity with a married woman who tried to find something different in a dark bar of Madrid. In this song, the singer clearly describes a scene with both lovers in the bed snorting cocaine from the crystal of the weeding photo of the woman. Finally, the illicit romance ends with the protagonist getting drunk to try forget the affair. The sixth and last maxi single of this album released in 1993, was the ending track, \\"Pastillas para no so√±ar\\" (Pills to not to dream), an optimistic song in which the audience is invited to live freely, without worries, regardless of what others say. This song is worth of note because of its arrangements for which he counted with the collaboration of the Municipal Orchestra of Mostoles, a little town of southern Madrid.  Track listing   Reception  F√≠sica y qu√≠mica turned into a milestone in Joaqu√≠n Sabina's career both critically and commercially. This album was praised for the originality of its lyrics and by the interesting stories featured in the track-listing. Commercially, this record sold more than a million copies in Spain and Latin America, outselling Hotel Dulce Hotel (1987), his previously best selling album. This sales record remained unchallenged till 1999, when the album \\"19 d√≠as y 500 noches\\" (19 days and 500 nights) unexpectedly reached even higher sales.  Versions of some songs  * The song \\"Y nos dieron las diez\\" has been uncountably covered by various artists. One of the many versions of this song was sung by the popular diva Roc√≠o Durcal in whose version can be appreciated an even more intense Mexican atmosphere. Another version of this song was sung in 2003 by the Bolero singer Tamara which was included in the tribute album \\"Entre todas las mujeres\\" (Between al women). * The song \\"La canci√≥n de las noches perdidas\\" Was covered in 2003 by the singer Pasi√≥n Vega whose version was also included in the tribute album \\"Entre todas las mujeres\\".

Location The road starts in Kampala and continues north, through eight Ugandan districts, and ends in Gulu, a distance of approximately . The road passes through the districts of Kampala, Wakiso, Luweero, Nakasongola, Kiryandongo, Oyam, Omoro and Gulu. The coordinates of the road near the town of Karuma are 02¬∞14'04.0\\"N, 32¬∞14'46.0\\"E (Latitude:2.234444; Longitude:32.246111). Overview The road from Kampala to Gulu is old (first constructed in the 1940s), and narrow. Instead of the regulatory of roadway, with shoulders and drainage channels, this road is only in some sections, leaving little room for vehicles to overtake one another. The Kampala‚ÄìGulu Road, is one of the most accident-prone in the country, along with Kampala‚ÄìJinja Road, Kampala‚ÄìMasaka Road and the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway. In 2016, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), committed to widen the narrow sections of this road. Intersections Along its journey, the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway intersects with several major roadways, including the following: (a) at Bwaise, it cuts across the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway. (b) the Matugga‚ÄìKapeeka Road peels off the highway at Matugga. (c) in Wobulenzi, the Ziroobwe‚ÄìWobulenzi Road connects with this highway (d) the Luweero‚ÄìButalangu Road intersects with the Gulu highway in Luweero. (e) the Kafu‚ÄìMasindi Road, measuring , branches off the Gulu highway at Kafu, Uganda, in Kiryandongo District. (f) At Rwekunye, the Rwekunye‚ÄìApac‚ÄìAduku‚ÄìLira‚ÄìKitgum‚ÄìMusingo Road meets the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway. (g) The Masindi‚ÄìKigumba Road meets with the Gulu Highway. (h) in Karuma, north of the Karuma Bridge, the Karuma‚ÄìOlwiyo‚ÄìPakwach‚ÄìNebbi‚ÄìArua Road makes a sharp left turn, off the Kampala-Gulu Highway. (i) Approximately further north, at Kamdini, the Kamdini‚ÄìLira Road, makes a sharp right turn to continue on to Lira, to the east. In Gulu, this road interacts with the Gulu‚ÄìNimule Road and with the Gulu-Kitgum Road. Other considerations When the Kampala‚ÄìBombo Expressway is built, as expected, it will constitute the first of the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway.

During the 1990s, the option first appeared in a ballot as part of the second political status referendum held during the Pedro Rossell√≥ administration. Within the PPD =Cordero Santiago; Liberales vs. Hern√°ndez Col√≥n= On November 19, 1970, the Central Council of the PPD issued what became known as the Pronunciamiento de Aguas Buenas (lit. \\"Aguas Buenas Pronnouncement\\") which stated its support for a \\"complete self-government, founded in the free association with the United States and which permits and supports the country's cultural personality and the sustained development of its social and material progress.\\" However throughout the 1970s, conservative governor Hern√°ndez Col√≥n ambiguously used the term \\"free association\\" when referring to the territorial Commonwealth, which was promoted to the PPD's base as an \\"Freely Associated State\\" (in a literal translation of Estado Libre Asociado). This lack of clarity extended beyond Puerto Rico, in a presentation before the UN's Ad Hoc Committee in 1974, he stated that \\"Geographically Puerto Rico is part of the Caribbean. While culturally being part of the Hispano-American communities. In political and economic terms, it is associated to the United States. These points, but especially the free association status, define the international role of Puerto Rico.\\" In 1975, a bilateral Ad Hoc Committee organized to discuss the potential development of the Commonwealth presented a proposal known as El Nuevo Pacto, which supported the creation of a Free Associated State based on the sovereignty of Puerto Rico, with the purpose of living in a permanent association that was \\"mutually satisfactory and fair\\". In 1976, Francisco Aponte P√©rez founded PROELA, which became the first free association organization affiliated to the PPD. Aponte P√©rez described the concept as \\"a way to obtain a fine equilibrium that allows [Puerto Rico] to retain its characteristics as a country and grants it vinculation without surrender\\". The final interview ever granted by Mu√±oz was published by El Mundo on July 25, 1978. In it, he gives his final posture regarding the status, noting that \\"if Puerto Rico had gained its independence from Spain and would have approached the United States to join them, in an autonomous union, with only a minimum of powers being renounced to accomplish that union, that would be a good definition for a developed autonominity.\\" On September 13, 1978, the UN's Decolonization Committee issued a resolution recognizing the viability of free association to solve the status of Puerto Rico. Under the presidency of Carlos Romero Barcel√≥, the PNP published a booklet titled El ABC de la estadidad (lit. \\"The ABC of Statehood\\") which defined free association as an \\"Associated Republic\\", claiming that it defied \\"all Federal laws, agencies, jurisdiction and appointments\\" and that it asked for block funding so that \\"[the PPD] could take their share as they want\\". By using the word \\"Republic\\", the PNP intended to link the concept to independence, an option that they were in turn linking to the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Rafael Cordero Santiago's grave On January 29, 1985, the Commission for the Study of Puerto Rico's Constitutional Development of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico studied the free association compacts of Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. The group determined that those compacts could be modified to adjust to Puerto Rico's case. On April 11, 1989, senator Marco Antonio Rigau officially presented a free association proposal to the PPD's Government Board (Spanish: Junta de Gobierno). On April 24, 1989, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n dismissed the project, claiming that it did not represent the Board's position nor his own in a press conference held at La Fortaleza. Within the PPD, the project's opposers accused Rigau of forcing a form of independence or \\"associated republic\\". The president of the PR House of Representatives, conservative Rony Jarabo, echoed Hern√°ndez Col√≥n and supported his position that the party had already approved the territorial Commonwealth by approving the governor's proposal in the party's Government Programme. Rigau asked the conservative leadership to analyze the content with neutrality and defended his project, claiming that it was well thought, taking five years to draft and that it received a warm reception in Washington. Hern√°ndez Col√≥n led the Board's consideration of the proposal on April 30, 1989, presenting his own proposal supporting a territorial development of the Commonwealth, which pursued a form of \\"permanent union\\" with the United States. The day before, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n had participated in a reunion along other members of the party's conservative wing, during which he shredded the copy of the free association project that was provided to him, also ordering a veto on Rigau's intentions to individually seek supporters in Washington. In a subsequent interview with Jos√© Delgado, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n dismissed the existence of a liberal wing within the PPD, claiming that there were only a \\"few liberal feathers\\" led by a group of \\"young attorneys\\". The proposal was publicly endorsed by PR House of Representatives Vice President Samuel Ram√≠rez, PPD Youth Organization President Cirilo Tirado and representatives Carlos Vizcarrondo, Luis E. Cab√°n and V√≠ctor Negr√≥n. Antonio Fern√≥s L√≥pez-Cepero, Jr. was also a key figure in its promotion. Supporting Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's position of a territorial development were Eudaldo B√°ez Galib, Antonio Colorado, Victoria Mu√±oz, Jaime Fuster, Sergio Pe√±a Cl√≥s and Presby Santiago. PR Rep. Severo Colberg Ram√≠rez publicly endorsed it, but voted along the conservative leadership in the Board. By alienating the liberal voters, the governor opted to ignore the fact that the PPD's gubernatorial races of 1980 and 1984 had received a significant support from non-affiliated left-wing voters, who played a key role despite the PNP employing the use of terms such as \\"separatist alliance\\" to associate them to the independence movement. To further complicate matters, the PIP took a proposal to Congress that would create a temporary \\"Associated Republic\\", which was actually a proposal of independence combined with a collaboration treaty between parts. Caught in the middle of this division, the General Council of the PPD approved a definition for the \\"new Commonwealth\\" on November 17, 1990, which established that the development had to take place outside the territorial clause of the United States's constitution. This was the result of an amendment proposed by Carlos Vizcarrondo, which became known as La Enmienda Vizcarrondo. Hern√°ndez Col√≥n presented a proposal of further development for the Commonwealth within the territorial clause which failed to gather support in the United States Congress, but which was passed on to failed gubernatorial candidate Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza. In 1993, Ponce mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago began displaying his support for a non territorial development of the status issue, managing to get a timid pro-sovereignty support in the definition of the Commonwealth approved for a status referendum despite the conservative postures of the PPD leadership. This was accompanied by a series of actions where he supported the collaboration of the liberal wing of the PPD and factions of the independence movement, the first of them being Marcha del Idioma Espa√±ol (lit. \\"March for the Spanish Language\\") which opposed Pedro Rossell√≥'s proposal to adopt English as an official language. Cordero became involved in several cooperative initiatives, and efforts done between 1994 and 1996 concluded in La Naci√≥n en Marcha (lit. \\"The Nation Marching\\"), a multi-sectorial protest that boycotted a meeting between American governors and members of the PNP. =Status Commission, 1998 referendum= In 1997, following the failed campaign of conservative H√©ctor Luis Acevedo for the governorship, PR Rep. An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° became the president of the PPD. Under his leadership a Status Commission was created, with William Miranda Mar√≠n serving as its president. PR Sen. Jos√© Ortiz- Daliot, a known supporter of free association, was named Executive Director of the PPD's Status Commission. The entity held public hearings to gauge the ideological tendencies of the party's base. During the process, the liberals were pleasantly surprised, discovering that despite the conservative message promoted throughout the previous decades, the party's base was notably more liberal than the political class. On March 15, 1997, the PPD's Youth Organization held a reunion with several older figures within the party, among which was Acevedo Vil√°. There a new proposal for the development of the Commonwealth was drafted, which reclaimed the retention of Puerto Rico's sovereignty and established the need for a \\"bilateral pact of permanent association\\" between both parts. In 1997, US Rep. Don Young introduced status bill H.R. 856 that became known as the \\"Young Project\\". The proposal included a two-step referendum listing two categories \\"options within the United States sovereignty\\" (subdivided into statehood and the pre-existent territorial Commonwealth) and \\"options within a separate sovereignty for Puerto Rico\\" (subdivided into free association and independence). However, the language used by Young was criticized as being akin to the pro-statehood faction. The use of the word \\"separate\\" being linked to \\"separatist\\", an adjective commonly used in a derogatory manner by the PNP. The fact that the representative publicly used the term \\"independent free association\\", referencing independence, contributed to the figures that linked him to the pro-statehood movement. The PPD decided to lobby against the bill. On April 21, 1997, PROELA (through its vice-president Angel Ortiz Guzm√°n) issued a letter to Young in support of sovereign free association, proposing the retention of several key elements and arguing that only a \\"Commonwealth in full free association\\" should be included in the referendum. The bill ultimately failed to advance in Congress. On July 11, 1998, Acevedo Vil√° traveled to a hearing in Washington, where he argued his support for a development based on sovereignty that was \\"non colonial, non territorial\\" but also retained the use of the United States Citizenship. Two weeks later, during the Anniversary of the Constitution, he publicly supported that the development of the Commonwealth could only be viable through the elimination of the territorial clause. Acevedo Vil√° expressed that Puerto Rico was \\"ready to employ the power to commerce with other countries, develop politics that support its economic growth and be able to reach international agreements [...] including the capacity to be a member of regional and international organizations\\", calling this a step that would \\"take [Puerto Rico] not to the left or right, but forward\\". An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° On October 15, 1998, the PPD's Government Board adopted a proposal based on reclaiming the sovereignty. Despite being unrefined, this marked the first time that a non-territorial formula became the institutional position of the PPD. Mayors Cordero Santiago, Miranda Mar√≠n (Caguas) and Jos√© Aponte de la Torre (Carolina) were instrumental in the adoption of this definition. However, the following months brought internal controversy between the members of the free association movement within the PPD due to a second status referendum being organized by the Rossell√≥ administration. The older leaders decided to avoid testing their newly adopted definition in a PNP-mechanism without the time for it to become widely accepted, instead supporting a vote for the \\"None of the above\\" option. However, the younger members of the faction, including Luis Vega Ramos, Jorge Colberg Toro and N√©stor Duprey, decided to request the $500,000 assigned to defend the definition of free association included in it, despite not entirely agreeing with the conditions included. Angel Ortiz Guzm√°n decided to contest the definition of free association, but was unable to derail the process. In the end, most liberals within the PPD fell in line with the official position and voted for \\"None of the above\\". While \\"free association\\" only gathered 4,536 votes, it still fared favorably against the \\"territorial Commonwealth\\" option, which only received 993 votes. Afterwards, the intervention of Cordero Santiago prevented disciplinary sanctions against the group that promoted the \\"free association\\" option. Despite conservative Sila Calder√≥n becoming the PPD's candidate for governor, the proposal itself was included in the party's platform prior to the 2000 general elections. Despite belonging to the party's right wing, she defied that faction's proposal to place Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's eldest son, as the candidate to the position of Resident Commissioner. Instead, she promoted Acevedo V√≠la to fill the role, also blocking his original intention to become the president of the PR House of Representatives. Acevedo V√≠la went on to defeat Hern√°ndez Mayoral by 12% in the subsequent primaries. The PPD won both positions in the general elections. Both branches of the legislature were controlled by liberals, with Antonio Fas Alzamora becoming the PR Senate's president and Vizcarrondo the PR House of Representatives' speaker. However, Calder√≥n avoided the status issue throughout her term, citing that economic issues were a priority for her administration. Other movements and activism From his position of Law Professor Antonio Fern√≥s L√≥pez-Cepero, Jr. followed in the footsteps of his father, making his own proposals for a free association compact, among which was the elimination of the \\"colonial position\\" once occupied by his father, the Resident Commissioner. His defense of free association and constant critics to the conservative interpretation of his father's work by figures such as Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, earned him the tongue-in-cheek nickname \\"high priest of soberanismo\\" from Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral. Among the independent voices that proposed a concept of free association was, Enrique V√°zquez Quintana, who argued in his proposal that a concept based on the legendary round table should be established, with representation from the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States as well as a single representative from the United Nations. In 1997, noting the perception that the status debate was not advancing within the PPD, he proposed the creation of a new party, Partido por la Libre Asociaci√≥n (lit. \\"Party for Free Association\\"), to directly promote free association. The initiative turned into the Partido Acci√≥n Civil (lit. \\"Civil Action Party\\"), which dropped the status from its platform, aborting the initiative. Ricardo Alegr√≠a, a fervent supporter of independence and culture, noted that he would be willing to temporarily support free association in this meant abolishing the territorial clause. Juan Mari Br√°s, expressed a similar position, claiming that while it is not independence, free association is flexible and \\"is not a one way street like statehood\\".

The 2000s marked the first time that an incumbent governor ran on a platform advocating sovereignty, when An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° did so for the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). The term soberanista was popularized as a consequence, and the ideological breach within the party widened as the conservative wing backed the territorial Commonwealth. During the 2010s, free association recorded its best performance at the polls, finishing as runner-up of the 2012 status referendum. This decade also marked the first time that another party presented supporters of free association in the ballot, with the participation of the Movimiento Uni√≥n Soberanista (MUS). Within the PPD =Acevedo Vil√°, Miranda Mar√≠n and the ELA Soberano= The perceived inaction of governor Sila Calder√≥n in regards to the political status produced the reaction of several liberal figures within the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), most notably Cordero Santiago. In 2002, Jos√© Tr√≠as Monge participated in the presentation of a book titled \\"Cr√≥nica de una Guerra Anunciada\\" authored by N√©stor Duprey, where he expressed that there was no perceivable difference between free association as defined by the UN and the culmination of the Commonwealth as envisioned by Fern√≥s. On May 13, 2002, in expressions directed to president George W. Bush Cordero Santiago stated that \\"Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States of America and an self-sufficient model can't be developed due to limitations imposed by the executive branch and Congress\\". At the 50th Anniversary of the Constitution, Miranda Mar√≠n insisted that \\"the goal should be to fight in order to obtain the maximum level of sovereignty possible with double citizenship until we can reach the evolution of our status on that of a Sovereign Associated State in line with the relationship of the countries in the European community\\". After being jailed for participating in the widespread protests against the presence of the United States Navy in Vieques, Cordero Santiago began organizing a series multi- sectorial reunions with hopes of organizing a new status project based on his belief in free association. However, this was never materialized due to his sudden death on January 17, 2004. Despite being a member of Calder√≥n's cabinet, Acevedo V√≠la would publicly point out any discrepancy that he perceived with the government's official version, causing a direct confrontation between both. Calder√≥n ultimately supported Hern√°ndez Mayoral as the next candidate for the position of governor. Despite this support, Hern√°ndez Mayoral abandoned the candidature and former governor Pedro Rosell√≥ became the PNP's candidate. Acevedo V√≠la became the PPD's official candidate, choosing conservative Roberto Pratts as his candidate for Resident Commissioner. This was a strategy to diminish the differences between both wings, portraying a common goal. In October 2003, after regaining the presidency of the PPD, Acevedo Vil√° reaffirmed his expressions of 1998 and within a year, the organization of a Constituent Assembly to attend the status of Puerto Rico became part of the party's 2004 Programme for Government. The PPD's government program once again supported the non-territorial development of the Commonwealth. In the 2004 general elections, Acevedo V√≠la defeated Rosell√≥, while Pratts lost to Luis Fortu√±o. In 2005, Acevedo Vil√° presented a status bill that would attend the issue and subsequently pursue a Constituent Assembly if the people of Puerto Rico supported a new process. However, after the PNP delegation replaced it with a substitutive proposal that established the Constituent Assembly as only \\"a possibility\\", the governor vetoed the project citing that \\"the [PNP was] trying to fool the country\\". George W. Bush's administration released a task force report in December 2005. The document was controversial among both factions of the PPD, first because it directly declared that the sovereignty of Puerto Rico lied exclusively in Congress and that any further development within the territorial clause was implausible and secondly, because it listed free association as a variant of independence, despite it being listed separately in the UN's General Assembly Resolution 1514. However, the report does differentiate free association from independence in practice, declaring that both the retention of the United States Citizenship and of free access (travel between countries without the need of a visa) between parts could be negotiated as part of the compact. The inform concludes that among the \\"constitutionally viable\\" options, it represents the one closest to the historical \\"perfected Commonwealth\\". Amidst the controversy that followed, the PPD's vice president and president of the PPD Mayors Association, Jos√© Aponte de la Torre, noted that the party's ideology should be redefined and reaffirmed his belief in free association. Following the release of the Bush administration's status Task Force, the PPD's Government Board approved a document reaffirming its support for a \\"dignified association\\" that was based on the sovereignty of Puerto Rico. Acevedo Vil√° assigned Carlos Dalmau Ram√≠rez as his representative before the UN's Decolonization Committee, delivering a speech where he asked for cooperation from the UN's General Assembly in pursuing an exercise of free determination and support for a \\"non colonial, non territorial\\" form of association. The governor's statement noted that \\"like the rest of our people, the [PPD] rejects all forms of colonialism\\", \\"[now] more than fifty years after the adoption of the Commonwealth, it is evident that the issue of Puerto Rico's status was not resolved in 1952\\", also arguing the need for a move towards an \\"sovereign, association [that included] joint responsibility with the United States\\". On July 16, 2006, the PPD's General Assembly adopted Resolution No. AG2006-01 which established that any citizen interested in running under its insignia, should compromise with the need to \\"attend the status issue with out dilation\\" and support the organization of the Constituent Assembly towards that goal. On July 29, 2007, the PPD's General Assembly adopted Resolution No. AG2007-04, in support of Acevedo Vil√°'s proposal to raise the issue of Puerto Rico's status to the General Assembly of the UN. Resolution No. AG2007-05 was also approved and it established that the sovereignty of Puerto Rico was \\"irrevocable\\" and the cornerstone \\"of a non- colonial, non-territorial association relationship in accordance to international law\\". On April 27, 2008, an Extraordinary Assembly was organized where Acevedo Vil√° vividly argued the need for a sovereign development of the Commonwealth in association with the United States. The proposal also established that the specifics of the future association would include the considerations of people beyond the PPD and ordered the party's president to present their demands before the UN. PR Rep. Charlie Hern√°ndez presented a resolution that reaffirmed the pro-sovereignty posture of the \\"non colonial, non territorial\\" development of the status as proposed in 1998, Programmes for Government of 2000 and 2004, the similar resolutions approved in 2006-07 and the Enmienda Vizcarrondo (formarly known as General Council Resolution of November 17, 1990). On May 15, 2008, the PPD's Status Commission adopted the party's Programme of Governme for the 2008 general elections, which was the first document to introduce the label Estado Libre Asociado Soberano when referring to free association. This Commission was presided by Acevedo Vil√° and its executive director was Charlie Hern√°ndez. Other members included PR Representatives Luis Vega Ramos and H√©ctor Ferrer, PR Senators Antonio Fas Alzamora and Jos√© Luis Dalmau, as well as non-elected figures Roberto Prats and Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's eldest son, Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral. None of which openly rejected the pro-sovereignty language during the drafting process. The proposal was prepared by Miranda Mar√≠n and established a timeline that went from the Pronunciamiento de Aguas Buenas to a deliberation supporting the non-territorial and sovereign development that first took place on October 15, 1998, and had been approved in seven consecutive General Assemblies. Afterwards Miranda Mar√≠n brought the pro-sovereignty proposal before the Programme Assembly, responsible for approving the party's proposal prior to the general elections, where it was approved unanimously. =Soberanistas vs. Hern√°ndez Mayoral & Ferrer= Following Acevedo Vil√°'s loss, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n began pursuing control of the PPD's leadership by supporting conservative candidates for the party's leadership positions. His candidates revived the proposal of a territorial development of the Commonwealth, also recycling the term \\"permanent union\\" when referring to this proposal. This shattered the ties that the party had created with other movements and factions, particularly the more liberal ones. With the conservative wing regaining control of the Government Board, H√©ctor Ferrer, who has publicly expressed his aversion towards free association, was selected as the party's president. The new president designated Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral to the position of Secretary of International and Federal Affairs, which established Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's position as the leadership's official status stance. However, this time the conservative leadership decided to adopt the term autonomistas, a vague name that means \\"autonomy-supporter\\" and had been frequently used to differentiate the soberanistas, to describe their faction while claiming that they believed in the \\"maximum autonomous development of the commonwealth within the territorial clause\\", but did not believe in retaining the sovereignty of Puerto Rico, instead equating it to independence. While conservatives led by PR Sen. Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla placed the blame of the loss on the pro-sovereignty discourse, others noted that representatives Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, Charlie Hern√°ndez, Luis Vega Ramos and Luis Ra√∫l Torres, as well as senators Antonio Fas Alzamora and Cirilo Tirado were directly elected, while conservatives such as Colberg Toro entered as a product of the Minority Law to the PR House. A tug war ensued between both factions, where Miranda Mar√≠n warned that if the PPD resisted the change implied by free association, it would become irrelevant as a political force during the 21st century. Parallel to the internal struggle in the PPD, a group of non-affiliated civilians founded Alianza pro Libre Asociaci√≥n Soberana (lit. \\"Alliance for Sovereignty in Free Association\\") intending to independently defend the free association option. The inclusion of a \\"Sovereignty in association with the United States\\" option in Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi's H.R. 2499 (known as the Puerto Rico Democracy Act) ignited these differences, after receiving the cautious support of some within the free association movement and the outright opposition of the conservative leadership. On March 24, 2009, a group of representatives and mayors led by Luis Vega Ramos, Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Carlos \\"Charlie\\" Hern√°ndez, Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, V√≠ctor Vasallo, Mart√≠n Vargas and Pedro Garcia, issued a press release listing the evolution of the free association movement within the PPD. On May 26, 2009, Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral published an article where he labeled the soberanistas as \\"independence supporters\\" and claimed that sovereignty \\"endangers the American Citizenship\\". Immediately, the three members of the free association movement within the International and Federal Affairs Office, Charlie Hern√°ndez, Vega Ramos and Nestor Duprey, sent a letter to Ferrer noting that the 2008 Programme of Government remained the ideological position of the PPD and requested a clarification that the expressions of Hern√°ndez Mayoral were to be interpreted as personal opinion and not as an official representation of the party's stance due to his position as the secretary. Ferrer shied away from the controversy, instead insisting his interest that the issue was \\"discussed\\" and noted that he had reached an agreement with Miranda Mar√≠n so that the status issue could be internally debated in forums with representations from the eight Districts. However, the representative who was tentatively appointed to lead these forums, Jorge Colberg Toro, abandoned his previous defense of free association and sided with Hern√°ndez Mayoral, criticizing the soberanistas and also requesting to be released from this commitment. Garc√≠a Padilla quickly joined them, reaffirming his conservative stance and saying that the PPD \\"is not an independence party\\". Miranda Mar√≠n responded by telling Hern√°ndez Mayoral that if his intention was to make imprudent generalization, then he should keep quiet. Ferrer responded to this by defending Hern√°ndez Mayoral. Fas Alzamora emerged during the crossfire and suggested that the matter was attended internally, but not before telling Ferrer that the divisive expressions of Hern√°ndez Mayoral were akin to the statehood movement and that if they were allowed to continue, this would inevitably end in a division that would be the \\"coup de grace for the PPD\\". Ferrer responded by trying to avoid the matter, simply saying that \\"everybody has the right of an opinion, but everybody has the responsibility to listen\\". Shortly afterwards, the conservative wing created a group that they baptized as Fuerza nueva popular (lit. \\"New popular force\\") which was preeminently composed by Ferrer, Hern√°ndez Mayoral, Garc√≠a Padilla and Roberto Prats. The ongoing controversy and the PPD status posture motivated the actions of civil organizations that supported free association. Members of ALAS visited a session of the European Parliament in Brussels following arrangements made by Miguel Norbert Ubarri, who worked as a professor in the adjacent municipality of Antwerp. This was the first step of an internationalization agenda, where the group attempted to promote the existence free association movement before several international organizations. Their next target was the UN's Special Committee on Decolonization. Concurrently, the Proyecto de Alianza e Impacto Soberanista (lit. \\"Project for Pro-Sovereignty Alliance and Impact\\") was created to served an educational organization and develop its own free association model. Presided by Alfredo Carrasquillo, the group had a membership of over 100 figures including the notable participation of Miranda Mar√≠n. Within the Universities, there was also the appearance of new student-run organizations that support free association, such as the Asociaci√≥n de Estudiantes Puertorrique√±os por un ELA Soberano (lit.\\"Association of Puerto Rican Students for a ELA Soberano\\") presided by Adrian Brito. On May 30, 2009, a nonpartisan educational organization named Instituto Soberanista Puertorrique√±o (lit. \\"Puerto Rican Pro-Sovereignty Institute\\") was founded under the leadership of former PPD-affiliate √Ångel Collado Schwarz, congregating members from the free association and independence movement. William Miranda Mar√≠n The PNP quickly exploited these conflicts, with Fortu√±o intervening and telling the PPD to define itself, and also claiming that the definition of \\"Sovereignty in association with the United States\\" present in H.R. 2499 was taken from the 2008 Programme of Government. However, Acevedo Vil√° intervened by sending a letter to the president of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, claiming that the definition was actually based on the Bush's task force report of 2005, and strongly opposing H.R. 2499 by saying that it \\"is unfairly structured to produce an artificial majority for making Puerto Rico the 51st state of the Union\\". He concluded by reaffirming his support for the development of the \\"Commonwealth status based on the sovereignty of the People of Puerto Rico to sustain the relationship, not simply a mere continuation of the current Commonwealth.\\" These arguments were celebrated by Charlie Hern√°ndez, Luis Vega Ramos, Carmen Yul√≠n and Cirilo Tirado, who received with satisfaction the public expressions of their former leader amidst the internal status debate. Both Ferrer and Miranda Mar√≠n were summoned before the House Committee on Natural Resources, where H.R. 2499 was a prominent topic. In an interview, Ferrer explained his posture, claiming that he believed in a \\"pact of association\\" but not in a \\"treaty of association\\". He explained this contradiction by noting his believe that a \\"treaty\\" could only be reached between independent nations. Ferrer, however, expressed his belief that a \\"pact of association\\" could remove Puerto Rico out of the Territorial Clause while continuing subjected to the United States Constitution. Despite claiming that under his leadership the PPD would pursue a \\"non territorial\\" form of Commonwealth, he openly disregarded the notion of national sovereignty and claimed that he supported \\"popular sovereignty\\", a term usually applied to the right to vote. Ferrer explained that under his \\"enhanced Commonwealth\\", Puerto Rico would only have a local level of sovereignty similar to the American states and would not possess international jurisdiction. He responded further questions by mentioning his opposition towards an \\"associated republic\\". The ambiguity of these answers was noted by the journalist that published the interview. The following day, Ferrer once again quoted his proposal for a \\"pact of association\\" and tried to qualm the controversy by saying that \\"[they] should work towards a consensus\\" and that \\"everybody fits within the PPD\\" during a reunion of the General Council. Charlie Hern√°ndez, Luis Vega Ramos, Carmen Yul√≠n, Cirilo Tirado and N√©stor Duprey attended the meeting. However, Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral was the first to dismiss the possibility that this meant a definitive ceasefire. Maintaining the stance adopted before, Ferrer attended a hearing in the UN Committee on Decolonization, where he openly rejected free association and debated the development of the Commonwealth beyond the three options listed in general assembly resolution 1514 (independence, integration or association) citing a single sentence of General Assembly Resolution 2625 which states the possibility of the \\"emergence into any other political status freely determined by a people\\", which he felt would allow further development within the territorial clause. His argument was criticized as an oxymoron, since it intended to exploit a perceived loophole while ignoring the fact that based on International Law, the UN would not accept \\"fourth options\\" where one of the sides would remain permanently subdued to the other. During these hearings, Charlie Hern√°ndez read a declaration that was also subscribed by Luis Vega Ramos, Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, Luis Ra√∫l Torres, V√≠ctor Vassallo Anad√≥n and Cirilo Tirado, where he defended free association, blamed the UN for the lack of action regarding the status debate and requested that the case of Puerto Rico was returned to the General Assembly. Afterwards, Hern√°ndez Mayoral published another column arguing his belief of an \\"enhanced commonwealth\\" within the territorial clause and argued that under free association, the United States citizenship was not guaranteed. Like the previous occasion, this created another rift, which saw Vega Ramos respond by urging a stop to campaigns that promote \\"unfounded fears\\". He, along Charlie Hern√°ndez and N√©stor Duprey, also vacated their seats at the PPD International and Federal Affairs Office. PROELA intervened and its president noted that the Office of the United States Attorney General had released a memorandum in June 2002 (through John Yoo) supporting double citizenship, which in his opinion disabled the arguments of the conservative wing. Concurrently, Ferrer attended a hearing before the United States House Committee on Natural Resources accompanied by members of the conservative wing, once again expressing his refusal to pursue free association. Parallel to this, Acevedo Vil√° reaffirmed his pro-sovereignty stance in a letter written to president Barack Obama, where he requested that the administration acted on the status issue. Prior to the 2009 Anniversary of the Puerto Rican Constitution, several conservative members differed on how to proceed on the status issue. Garc√≠a Padilla argued that the status should not be discussed at all en route to the 2012 General Elections, while Colberg Toro noted that he was working in a manual \\"to attend the issue\\" and said that anyone who believed in a different status than the Commonwealth \\"[was] in the wrong party\\". The possibility of temporally lowering the profile of the internal rift was supported by some of the soberanistas, but Charlie Hern√°ndez argued that there was already a party with no status stance. At the event, Ferrer slowed the conservative discourse that he had been promoting until then, instead offering a \\"midpoint\\" between factions, the \\"New Social Pact\\", which would include participation in international organizations. The proposal received mixed receptions from the soberanistas, with Vega Ramos considering it a step in the right direction while Charlie Hern√°ndez was not entirely convinced. Among mayors, the situation was similar, while Hormigueros mayor Pedro Garc√≠a insisted that it was time to reclaim the sovereignty of Puerto Rico, the mayor of Dorado Carlos L√≥pez Rivera confirmed his conservative stance and rejected free association. On August 3, 2009, Hern√°ndez Mayoral published another article, this time directly labeling the soberanistas as the adversaries that were \\"destroying the PPD\\", claiming that while the free association gathered strength in polls published by the conservative Caribbean Business, the territorial Commonwealth lost it, which in his opinion allowed statehood to take hold and caused the 2008 loss. Like the times before, this exacerbated the internal division within the party. Instead of directly responding the attack, Vega Ramos questioned why Hern√°ndez Mayoral was imposing his personal agenda over the collective unity and warned that further attempts to expel them from the party would only destroy it. Charlie Hern√°ndez noted that during the exit polls that followed the 2008 General Elections, a majority voted while taking economic considerations as a priority and only a 16% minority did so due to the status issue. The article received a lukewarm response by the conservative wing led by Sila Mari Gonz√°lez and Garc√≠a Padilla, but Ferrer distanced from it. This time, Acevedo Vil√° emerged to take full responsibility of the 2008 loss and noted that his pro-sovereignty proposal actually had the opposite effect, instead unifying the groups that had been historically divided between the \\"enhanced\\" Commonwealth and free association in polls conducted by Peter D. Hart. Still trying to avoid becoming involved, Ferrer requested to \\"set personal aspirations aside\\". Miranda Mar√≠n published his own article questioning the honesty of Hern√°ndez Mayoral's column and contended that the intention was to \\"defend [justify] his own fears\\". The following month, it became public that Miranda Mar√≠n began organizing a team to run for the governorship of Puerto Rico. He held reunions with several figures of the industrial, environmentalist, artistic and political classes among other, some belonging to ALAS and PAIS. Through a series of associates, Miranda Mar√≠n organized an strategic approach that would educate the public of his proposal, a model of free association that was influenced by the European Union. Among the several figures involved, a series of reunions with Acevedo Vil√° stood out. The conservative wing responded by promoting the final draft of Colberg Toro's document. Named Pacto de futuro (lit. \\"Pact of the future\\") the draft promoted replacing Public Law 600 with another law which specified their demands to enhance the territorial Commonwealth, but specifically declaring that this did not equate to free association. Hern√°ndez Mayoral issued another critical article, but this time it was largely ignored. The free association movement within the PPD suffered a major hit when Miranda Mar√≠n was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Despite the challenge that this presented, PAIS continued their agenda with a visit to Washington. On October 8, 2009, the US. House Committee on Natural Resources published House Report 111-294, which directly dismissed the possibility of further developing the Commonwealth under the sovereignty of Congress. The document criticized the support given by the conservative wing of the PPD to an enhanced territorial Commonwealth, stating that \\"this hybrid proposal continues to be promoted in Puerto Rico as a feasible status option. Such proposals have resulted in misinformed and inconclusive referenda in Puerto Rico in July 1967, November 1993 and December 1998.\\" When Hern√°ndez Mayoral began demanding for a process that would \\"clarify\\" the posture of the PPD on free association, the soberanistas openly expressed that they didn't trust him to lead it from his position of Secretary of International and Federal Affairs. While the status issue took a hiatus while the party opposed H.R. 2499 in Washington, Ram√≥n Luis Nieves published a book that reviewed and answered 75 questions concerning the basics of a development of the Commonwealth based on its sovereignty titled El ELA que queremos, which received the endorsement of the liberal wing. In December, Hern√°ndez Mayoral insisted that the party should establish the conservative posture as an institutional posture. This time, the PPD's Government Board led by Ferrer, issued Resolution JG-2010-003 on a divided vote (opposing votes coming from Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Carmen Yul√≠n and Gil A. Rodr√≠guez), which immediately sparked another controversy. The document was based on Colberg Toro's manual and defines a series of steps to guide how the status issue should be attended insisting on the previous interpretation of UN General Assembly Resolution 2625, and intended to unilaterally revoke the pro-sovereignty posture approved by the General Council by expressing that the PPD \\"does not believe in the Associated Republic\\" and disregarding the pre-existent free association compacts of Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The mayors of Gu√°nica and Juana D√≠az, Mart√≠n Vargas Morales and Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez Torres were among the first to react, expressing their opposition to what they perceived as a \\"set back\\" and a \\"regrettable decision\\", noting that if the liberal wing is excluded that would mean a guaranteed loss for the PPD. However, the discerning voices were quick to point out that the Resolution had no real impact unless it was approved by the General Assembly. Hern√°ndez Mayoral was satisfied, saying that \\"[now] the soberanistas should reconsider their stay in the PPD\\", releasing a column inviting the soberanistas to follow the example of Vicente G√©igel Polanco. Carmen Yul√≠n reacted by claiming that the approval of it would be \\"dangerous\\" and that it contradicted the will of the General Assembly, an opinion echoed by Vega Ramos, who also labeled it a late \\"Christmas gift\\" for the PNP. Charlie Hern√°ndez believed that this development represented a sudden reversal of 50 years of \\"advances on the subject of the development of the current commonwealth status\\", a position also supported by Luis Raul Torres. PROELA demanded a clarification from Ferrer's leadership, questioning if the intention of the resolution was make it clear that any future negotiation would be done with the guarantee that Puerto Rico remains as a subordinate of the United States. Fas Alzamora formally requested a reconsideration, noting that \\"all of the aspirations for the development of the Commonwealth present within the PPD can be satisfied through free association\\". Comer√≠o mayor, Josian Santiago, who was serving as interim president of the PPD Mayors Association during Miranda Mar√≠n's illness, expressed that the Resolution was unexpectedly presented before the Board and that as the representative of the mayors, he voted against it since it only served as an exclusive device. To defend Resolution JG-2010-003, Ferrer responded by saying that in his opinion \\"sovereignty of the state\\" could only mean independence, and that a \\"fourth option\\" was viable \\"within the Constitution of the United States\\", noting that a series of reunions to discuss the manual would begin in March 2010. He also tried to justify the repudiation to the concept of an \\"Associated Republic\\", claiming that it was something \\"invented by the supporters of statehood\\". Colberg Toro claimed that the approbation was done to \\"defend the Commonwealth\\" before the possibility of another local status referendum. Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza coincided with Colberg and went further, claiming that the adoption of the pro-sovereignty posture in 2008 \\"was a mistake\\", expressing her belief that the Commonwealth and free association were separate entities. The soberanistas responded by involving the base by opening an online petition, which met and exceeded the pre-established quota within hours. The internal division caused by Resolution JG-2010-003 was quickly exploited by opposing parties, Juan Dalmau labeled the new posture \\"statehood lite\\", saying that \\"[the] new leadership ... flirts dangerously with statehood\\" and equating its ideology to that of the PNP. On January 26, 2010, Acevedo Vil√° criticized Resolution JG-2010-003 noting that its approval favored the PNP and urging that if the PPD \\"wants to clarify concepts and postures, then it should do so without threats of exclusion.\\" This position was rebutted by Ferrer, who defended his decision. Colberg insisted that Acevedo Vil√° should \\"move away\\" and blamed his involvement on a \\"power struggle\\" between the Ferrer leadership and the soberanistas that compose \\"[Acevedo Vil√°'s] internal circle\\", an action that was perceived as a provocation by Vega Ramos, Charlie Hern√°ndez and mild-conservative senator Eduardo Bhatia. Conservative representative Rafael \\"Tatito\\" Hern√°ndez followed this by announcing the creation of a group to defend the territorial Commonwealth and directly \\"face the associated republic and free association\\". He was joined by Carlos L√≥pez, who insisted that those that believe in them \\"should create their own party\\". The initiative was largely ignored by the soberanistas, only gaining the immediate critics of Carmen Yul√≠n who considered it divisive. In the morning of February 1, 2010, a series of posters with the phrase Fuera los soberanistas (lit. \\"Out with the soberanistas\\") and the PPD's logo where placed over San Juan. However, the conservative leadership denied involvement and instead blamed them on the PNP. =Pacto de Asociaci√≥n, ALAS and MUS= Ferrer held a press conference and officially presented the contents of Pacto de Futuro, also claiming that the new focus was \\"not of sovereignty, but economic\\". Parallel to this ideological controversy, ALAS requested the right to become the official representative of free association in the Fortu√±o referendum. The group's spokesperson, Luis A. Delgado, noted that they intended to organize those that support the option while the conservative leadership prevented the PPD from doing so, giving the soberanistas within that party an opportunity to advance their ideology. Delgado also stated his opinion that the \\"fourth option\\" was a move to halt the advance of the free association movement within the PPD, noting that the dispositions of UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 only applied following a self-determination process where the recognition of sovereignty was inexorable and as such, could not be used to perpetuate the subordination of Puerto Rico. Vega Ramos agreed, further claiming that even if the territorial development proposed in the Pacto de Futuro was approved, Congress could always revoke their agreements as was the case with the Northern Mariana Islands. Under Santiago, the Mayors Association began an internal process to determine if they requested that the resolution was overturned, this strategy being separate from that of the other soberanistas who believed that the document was never the official posture of the PPD because \\"[it had] no weight because [the Board] cannot override what the assembly of delegates has decided.\\" Colberg considered that the efforts were \\"futile\\", claiming that the PPD would not participate in a referendum that excluded the territorial Commonwealth. Hern√°ndez Mayoral reacted by stating that even if the soberanistas left the PPD, they would be \\"too few to be considered a division\\", claiming that the number would surely round the 4,500 that voted for free association in the 1998 referendum. On February 15, 2010, a still ailing Miranda Mar√≠n pronounced a speech where he promoted the creation of a \\"country-wide project\\", requested clarity in the discourse of his fellow party members by noting that it was time to recognized previous errors, particularly those that had allowed the growth of the pro-statehood faction, and to use the term \\"colony [when referring] to what is a colony [and] sovereignty [when referring to] what is sovereignty\\", concluding his speech by insisting that a \\"rupture\\" with the past was needed to advance. The discourse was universally praised by the soberanistas and was perceived as a strong reprimand and warning to the conservative leadership of the PPD. In his support, Charlie Hern√°ndez noted that the mayor was asking to abandon the \\"paralyzing fears of the past\\" and that it was time to make sure that the PPD did not turn into a \\"facsimile pro- statehood party\\". ALAS extended congratulations for the speech, noting that Miranda Mar√≠n's posture opened the door for a widespread convergence. The expressions received the support of Ponce-based municipal party Movimiento Aut√≥nomo Ponce√±o (lit. \\"Autonomous Ponce Movement\\") through Rafael Cordero Santiago's brother, Ram√≥n Cordero Santiago. Hern√°ndez Mayoral responded by dismissing the speech by claiming that \\"95% of the PPD members don't believe in it\\" and insisting that it was a \\"call for independence\\", which was \\"incompatible [with their] stay in the PPD\\". Ferrer echoed this, defending the territorial Commonwealth and saying that he \\"could not coincide with Miranda Mar√≠n if he was supporting national sovereignty\\". However, despite opposing his stance, other conservatives such as Mu√±oz Mendoza were more cautious. On February 20, 2010, both Miranda Mar√≠n and Ferrer participated in a reunion between mayors held in Juana D√≠az, which produced no change in the postures of either one, though the Caguas mayor noted that his message was \\"being misinterpreted\\" by the conservatives. During the reunion the mayor of Juana D√≠az, Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez, presented a two-step resolution proposing that if the Pacto de Futuro failed to gain acceptance in the United States, then the party should demand the sovereignty of Puerto Rico. The document was supported by the mayors of Caguas, Aguas Buenas and Comer√≠o, but was left pending. The mayors also reached a consensus establishing that Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral did not represent them. In a subsequent article, Miranda Mar√≠n noted his belief that those that reacted defensively were \\"[under the influence] of the god of fear\\" and reaffirmed his belief, detailing how globalization had chanced the world since the establishment of the territorial Commonwealth. While the internal debate of the PPD lingered, Collado Schwarz announced the possibility that the ISP could eventually evolve into a political party. The organization noted that through their educational activities they had noticed an increased interest in sovereignty following Miranda Mar√≠n's speech. After the Obama administration's Task Force on Status held two sessions in Puerto Rico, ALAS denounced that the format did not allow them to defend their posture despite being present in both. Felling that \\"[the Task Force] decided to ignore Free Association, one of the three political options the international community, as well as the United States (US), recognizes as an option which provides a full measure of self-government\\", the group forwarded their proposals afterwards. PROELA and a group of representatives were able to present their arguments, with the later \\"[urging] the Administration to include the option of \\"Estado Libre Asociado Soberano\\" (Sovereign Commonwealth) in any serious self-determination process it chooses to support.\\" On March 4, 2010, Hern√°dez Mayoral who had served as the PPD's representative before the Task Force members, stated that the soberanistas that were not satisfied with his defense of the territorial Commonwealth \\"[were] no longer in tune with the [party]\\". Colberg supported him, stating that those that were against the presentation were instead \\"represented by Manuel Rodr√≠guez Orellana\\" (the pro-independence representative), which in turn earned the response of N√©stor Duprey who questioned his \\"power hunger\\", noting that \\"[Colberg] wasn't even elected\\" by popular vote. Pedro Garc√≠a, was among the first to criticize this posture, calling it divisive. After the soberanistas expressed their official opposition in a press conference, a group of ten conservative representatives led by Colberg and Roberto Rivera Ruiz de Porras signed a letter requesting that Luis Ra√∫l Torres was stripped of the position of Alternate Speaker of the PPD. Later that day, the PPD members of the PR House of Representatives held a reunion that lasted 7 hours. While the status issue was considered to \\"require additional discussion\\", those present reached a consensus against \\"divisive expressions\\" and \\"requests for exclusion\\". In an interview, Miranda Marin confessed that if he was able to defeat cancer his intentions was to pursue the office of governor. ALAS publicly endorsed a possible candidature. On March 8, 2010, Sen. Antonio Fas Alzamora published a new document, worked for ten months along Ram√≥n Luis Nieves and Jos√© Ariel Nazario, detailing his view of a compact of free association between Puerto Rico and the United States named Pacto de Asociaci√≥n (lit. \\"Compact of Association\\"). To appease the conservative faction of the PPD, he stretched that the act of reclaiming sovereignty and entering into association would be simultaneous, guaranteeing that \\"Puerto Rico [would] not be independent for a minute\\". Alzamora insisted that the document attended the demands of both factions and requested that it was perceived as the instrument to bring forth internal unity. Miranda Mar√≠n considered it \\"a very important contribution\\" and urged the PPD's leadership to analyze its content. Ferrer considered it a \\"working document\\". Charlie Hern√°ndez, Luis Vega Ramos and Carmen Yul√≠n welcomed it, while Jos√© Dalmau considered it a \\"well worked\\" proposal. ALAS expressed satisfaction with the proposal, calling it a \\"step in the right direction\\". Conservative Rafael \\"Tatito\\" Hern√°ndez was critic of it, holding a press conference to \\"unmask the free association of [Fas Alzamora's] Pact\\". The Pacto de Asociaci√≥n was published in Spanish and English, and its presentation was followed by public hearings held throughout Puerto Rico. Hern√°ndez Col√≥n went on to publish an opinion piece where he called soberanistas, within and outside the PPD, \\"gullible\\" and \\"romantic\\", identifying his wing as \\"pragmatic\\". The cases \\"Calero Toledo v. Pearson Yacht\\" (1974) and \\"Examining Board v. Flores de Otero\\" (1976) were used by the conservatives to justify the argument that \\"Congress renounced its control on local affairs\\" and that \\"[it] granted [Puerto Rico a degree of] autonomy comparable to that of the [US] states\\". Collado Schwarz dismissed these cases on the basis that they were Cold War-era documents that contradicted the resolution approved by the US House Natural Resources Committee just months before and that neither of the cases directly attended Puerto Rico's status. He went on to quote \\"First National Bank vs. Yankton County, 101 U.S. 129\\" (1879), which states that \\"[any] territory within the jurisdiction of the United States not included in any State must necessarily be governed by or under the authority of Congress\\". On April 19, 2010, it was announced that a group linked to Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral and Roberto Pratts were pursuing a movement to reclaim the presidential vote under the territorial clause. Despite being a conservative, Ferrer joined Charlie Hern√°ndez in stating that such an initiative would \\"[only] be linked to statehood\\". During the public hearings for H.R. 2499, a group of lobbyists led by Ferrer managed to convince US Rep. Virginia Foxx to present a amendment that would include the territorial Commonwealth (described as \\"status quo\\") in the project, essentially neutralizing its intention to pursue \\"non territorial options\\". The subsequent approval of this amended proposal in the US House of Representatives was not supported by the soberanistas of the PPD. Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Charlie Hern√°ndez and Carmen Yul√≠n questioned why the conservatives were celebrating the inclusion of a territorial definition of the Commonwealth. ALAS also criticized it as an \\"attempt to prolong the anguish of the colony represented by the current Commonwealth\\", noting that just days after the hearings the Chairman of the US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Jeff Bingaman, noted that free passage and double citizenship were viable under free association. A poll held by conservative radio station NotiUNO reflected that the 46% that once supported the Commonwealth was being splintered by the internal division, with free association representing a 17% of the total vote versus 29% for the status quo. This statistic included 23% of the participants that identified themselves with the PPD and meant a growth of 15% for the pro-sovereignty option in comparison to previous polls held by the station. As H.R. 2499 moved to the US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for consideration, Ferrer resumed the lobbying carried in the US House, this time confronting and accusing Pierluisi of including an association option \\"that references independence\\". The Resident Commissioner insisted that the definition of \\"Sovereignty in association with the United States\\" was directly taken from the PPD's 2008 Programme of Government. The soberanistas addressed the issue on their own in a letter where they opposed the mechanism of H.R. 2499 and requested a Constituent Assembly. During the public hearings, a third of the time was devoted to free association, with Luis Delgado and Jos√© Ortiz Daliot serving as representatives for ALAS. The group later noted that none of the Committee's members expressed a posture against the concept. Afterwards, the Committee made an request for information about the viable status options, including a specific inquiry regarding the inclusion of free association. On June 4, 2010, Miranda Mar√≠n died from complication of the pancreatic cancer that he suffered. What was a notable blow to the soberanistas within the PPD quickly evolved into another confrontation between factions. Initially the party agreed to avoid a power struggle by supporting the candidature of the late mayor's son, William Miranda Torres. However, PR Rep. Jos√© Varela decided to present a candidature and was elected by the Municipal Committee. The decision was criticized since most of the delegates had been named by Varela under Miranda Mar√≠n's administration and erupted in protests led by the late mayor's right hand man, Wilfredo Puig. However, Hern√°ndez Mayoral supported it claiming that it \\"[was] a legal matter\\". Facing the possibility that the division could cost them the next elections, the PPD decided to nullify the vote of the Municipal Committee and hold a special election to fill the vacancy, this despite Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's support to uphold the decision. The two were joined by a third candidate, Harry Vega. While Miranda Torres simpathized with the soberanistas, Varela aligned himself with the conservative wing, claiming that he would not allow \\"[them] to turn Caguas into a bastion for sovereignty\\". Miranda Torres prevailed in the special election by gathering 71.34% of the votes and shortly afterwards reaffirmed his affiliation to the soberanistas. On June 15, 2010, Fas Alzamora presented an amended version of the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n incorporating suggestions taken from the public hearings. Vega Ramos, Iv√°n Rivera, Collado Schwarz and Omar L√≥pez of ALAS attended the subsequent hearings of the UN's Decolonization Committee. After Ferrer announced the eventual organization of an \\"Internal Constituent Assembly\\" to refine the party's status ideology, the soberanistas criticized that the Pacto de futuro was being pushed to become the official posture, since according to them \\"it [was not] even a pact per se\\", but a \\"manual that failed to establish specific details\\". PROELA and ALAS supported these arguments. Colberg Toro responded by claiming that the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n had \\"no chance\\" of being approved since it was \\"too similar to the [association compact] of Palau\\" and that it \\"did not guarantee American citizenship [or] acquired rights.\\" Fas Alzamora responded by saying that those expressions were \\"completely incorrect\\" and accused the conservatives of spreading \\"disinformation\\", noting that the language of the project supported the retention of both citizenship and acquired rights. Fas Alzamora went on to express \\"surprise\\", claiming that he had reunited with Colberg Toro before publishing the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n and had even incorporated part of the Pacto de futuro's language to avoid ideological conflicts. Hern√°ndez Mayoral went further, claiming that the document was \\"plaguiated\\" from Palau's compact of association. Fas Alzamora discarded these expressions by labeling them as \\"another divisive action, of the same kind that we have grown accustomed to\\". After Ferrer expressed that other pro-sovereignty options did not represent a threat, ALAS replied by stating that without the soberanistas \\"the PPD can not win\\" and that their importance should not be \\"minimized\\". On August 17, 2010, the PPD's Government Board held a reunion following the ongoing conflicts. Despite the initial expectations that the soberanistas could be sanctioned or that the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n could be discarded, neither thing happened. On the other hand, the group reached a consensus stating that the Pacto de futuro was nothing more than a manual. A document presented by Hern√°ndez Mayoral against the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n was defeated. The Board ordered the creation of a Status Commission presided by PPD vicepresident Carlos Delgado Altieri and completed by Fas Alzamora, Colberg Toro, Carmen Yul√≠n and Brenda L√≥pez de Arrar√°s. On August 25, 2010, PAIS merged efforts with the ISP. Four days later, the members of the ISP decided to organize a new party to promote sovereignty. The group noted their interest to attract non-affiliated people that support free association or independence. However, the new entity would not have a specific political posture, instead simply revolving around the demand for sovereignty. The ISP's Executive Committee was formally reorganized into a Coordination Committee and the new party was named Movimiento Uni√≥n Soberanista. Carmen Yul√≠n criticized the ongoing conservative discourse of the PPD, noting her belief that \\"those that want permanent union have the option of joining the PNP and support statehood\\". This in turn led to public controversy between her and Ferrer. Intending to avoid the fate of the Directorio Soberanista, the MUS noted that its focus would be to earn a base by attracting the avid voters that were now inactive. On November 9, 2010, the group applied to be recognized as a political party for the 2012 general elections. The Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections granted the authorization to gather signatures on January 11, 2011. To be officially recognized, the MUS had to gather 97,000 valid signatures. On March 1, 2010, Collado Schwarz requested an investigation to the president of the CEE, H√©ctor Conty P√©rez, claiming that members of the PPD were calling their affiliates that had endorsed the MUS and were doing so while impersonating CEE officials. He went on to claim that the conservative leadership of the PPD's Government Board was responsible for these actions, following a reunion held on January 28, 2011. In a radio interview for Radio Isla, Ferrer refused to confirm or deny the allegations. =Soberanistas vs. Garc√≠a Padilla, 2012 referendum= Ferrer inherited the position of PPD president to fellow conservative Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla, who on March 6, 2011, announced his intention to run as candidate for the office of governor. The soberanistas took a cautious approach to this candidature, with Charlie Hern√°ndez, Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Carmen Yul√≠n and Vega Ramos not supporting it initially. The group insisted that \\"a dialogue process had to be completed first\\". Immediately after taking over, Garc√≠a Padilla noted that his campaign would not center around the status issue and that it would be eventually attended in a Constituent Assembly. The adoption of an option historically proposed by the soberanistas served to earn their conditioned endorsement. On March 16, 2011, the President's Task Force released their report, joining the others in stating that Puerto Rico remains under the Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The document also notes that any attempt to pursue an enhanced Commonwealth within the Territorial Clause would be \\"constitutionally problematic\\" and not permanent, since future Congresses retained the capacity of unilaterally modifying any agreements reached. The report proposed a mechanic that earned local critics, since it established a two-step referendum where the status alternatives were \\"cluttered together\\", the territorial Commonwealth and statehood in a \\"sovereignty remains in Congress\\" and \\"free association and independence\\" in a \\"Puerto Rico reclaims it sovereignty\\" option. The soberanistas were not satisfied with the report since, despite the document recommending \\"that at the time of any transition to a freely associated state, all Puerto Rican U.S. citizens retain their U.S. citizenship\\", the affirmation that \\"Free Association is a type of independence\\" directly contradicted UN General Assembly Resolution 1514, which identified both as distinctly separate decolonization alternatives. The format proposed for a two-step referendum was also criticized, being considered an attempt to retain the status quo, since being paired with the numerically weak independence would mean a guaranteed loss. ALAS expressed disappointment, stating that if the territorial Commonwealth \\"remained as a political option, the Task Force would have failed to accomplish its purpose and assignment\\" and noting their \\"precise objections [in relation] to the characterization of Free Association as an Independence category, the two plebiscite process, and its failure to consider applicable International Law\\". In April 2011, the PPD's Status Commission released a report. The document included \\"10 principles of association\\" for the non- territorial development of the Commonwealth, a dissection of both the Pacto de Asociacion and the Pacto de futuro, a study of the President's Task Force report and a recommendation to establish a permanent Status Commission. The document received the support of Delgado, Fas Alzamora and Yul√≠n, but Colberg Toro did not attend to vote and conservative L√≥pez de Arrar√°s voted against it. The publishing of the PPD's Status Commission report coincided with the change in administration, with Garc√≠a Padilla downgrading it to a \\"working document\\". This posture prevented the official presentation of the document before the Government Board and it was left indefinitely pending. Under Garc√≠a Padilla's leadership, the PPD ordered all PPD-affiliates that signed to certify the MUS to file another affiliation document, arguing that by endorsing another party they no longer belonged to the PPD. The MUS considered this a form of harassment and requested a clarification from Conty P√©rez. The group experienced further complications, including strategic differences that led to the exit of Collado Schwarz. On October 26, 2011, noted liberal Rafael Cox Alomar was announced as the candidate for the office of Resident Commissioner. However, throughout the campaign he shied away from establishing his ideological position, instead falling in line with the conservative discourse of Garc√≠a Padilla, who in turn ran his campaign individually. In 2011, the conservative wing launched an aggressive campaign among the PPD's base to ensure that the soberanistas failed to be elected in to the party's Government Board centering it around both of Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's sons. Due to the recurrent message promoting \\"permanent union\\" being used by the conservatives, the PNP approached Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral to join their party and defend statehood. On the other hand, Juan Eugenio Hern√°ndez Mayoral insisted that there was \\"no space\\" for anyone that did not share Garc√≠a Padilla's ideology. When Pedro Garc√≠a argued that the mayors should instead vote against Hern√°ndez Mayoral, he had a discussion with the conservative mayor of Sabana Grande, Miguel 'Papin' Ortiz, who accused him of \\"doing Rub√©n Berrios' work\\". PROELA asked the delegates for a fair vote, telling them to ignore the ideological campaigns. Despite the campaign carried against them, all but one of the free association movement's candidates were elected, with Luis Vega Ramos and Carlos Delgado Altieri being selected via at-large voting. Carmen Yul√≠n was elected by revalidating as president of the party's women functionaries, defeating the conservative candidate Yaramaris Torres with a margin of 1,152 to 512. Torres heavily defended the territorial status during her campaign and even criticized the soberanistas after admitting defeat. Despite being the centerpiece of the conservative campaign, neither of the Hern√°dez Mayoral managed to gather enough votes to be among the leaders, with Juan Eugenio failing to be elected and Jos√© Alfredo only entering in last place by a slim margin. On October 4, 2011, Fortu√±o announced that his administration would hold a local status referendum after H.R. 2499 failed to advance in the US Senate. In the project proposed and later approved, voters were going to be asked two questions: (1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and -if not- (2) to indicate the political status they preferred from three possibilities: \\"Statehood\\", \\"Independence\\" or a \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\". The referendum was set for November 6, 2012, the same day of the general elections. On December 19, 2011, during the public hearings of the Fortu√±o referendum bill, Fas Alzamora proposed an amendment that would adopt the Pacto de Asociaci√≥n as the definition of \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\" in the second question. His proposal was not approved by the PNP. In February 2012, the government board led by Garc√≠a Padilla announced the strategy of the conservative leadership to participate in the referendum, to vote \\"Yes\\" to continuing under the territorial clause and to not vote for any of the non-territorial options listed in the second question. They claimed that a vote for \\"Yes\\" meant a \\"yes for Puerto Rico\\" and sustaining his campaign on the notion that by supporting that option Fortu√±o would be antagonized with a \\"punishment vote\\". However, these arguments failed to convince several of the soberanistas, who idealized their own strategy. Figures such as Carmen Yul√≠n, Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Miranda Torres, Isidro Negr√≥n, Luis Vega Ramos and Antonio Fas Alzamora announced their decision to vote \\"Yes\\" in the first question to avoid entering in conflict with the conservative wing, but would also vote for the \\"Sovereign Free Association\\" option, both to directly defeat statehood and to gauge the real strength of the free association movement. Members of the free association movement topped the vote to select the party's PR House of Representative at-large candidates at the 2012 PPD's primary. Prominent soberanistas Carmen Yul√≠n and Luis Vega Ramos were the two leaders, with Charlie Hern√°ndez ranking fourth. As was the case with the previous election the candidates endorsed by the Hern√°ndez Mayoral brothers failed to influence the process, this time with their endorsed candidates Eduardo Ferrer and Roberto Vigoreaux failing to be elected. Carmen Yul√≠n's 2012 campaign headquarters. In April 2012, ALAS presented the signatures required to become the official representative of \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\" in the referendum and co-representative of the \\"No\\" option. The group presented an excess of 500 additional signatures beyond the number required, among which was that of Collado Schwarz. Since early 2011, Carmen Yul√≠n had hinted her interest in running for the mayorship of her native city of San Juan, but decided to step down when opposed by the conservative leadership of Garc√≠a Padilla, who named the now second in-command of that wing, H√©ctor Ferrer, to occupy the position. However, her name resurfaced following the resignation of Ferrer, who was forced to abandon the race due to a domestic abuse incident which led to a formal investigation. Although Yul√≠n initially denied running for mayor of the capital city, on March 26, 2012, she announced her decision to accept the party's petition and challenge incumbent mayor Jorge Santini. During the 2012 campaign, the gray kingbird (known in Spanish as pitirre), a bird known to persistently defend its territory even against much larger predators such as the red-tailed hawk (known locally as guaraguao) and which has become a traditional image for persistence in Puerto Rico, was adopted as a symbol by the soberanistas serving both as the official logo used by ALAS to represent \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\" in the ballot and as the mascot used by Yul√≠n during her campaign for the mayorship of San Juan. When Pablo Jos√© Hern√°ndez, son Jos√© Alfredo Hern√°ndez Mayoral, contradicted the official position and stated that a vote for the \\"Yes\\" option represented a vote for the status that the PPD would support, Charlie Hern√°ndez decided to defy the party's stance, choosing to vote \\"No\\" and for \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\". Garc√≠a Padilla responded by imposing an indefinite suspension on Hern√°ndez, which was lifted after it was heavily criticized by members of the PPD as both \\"imprudent\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". Despite the PPD's leadership asking for abstention, polls published by the centrist El Nuevo D√≠a and conservative El Vocero reflected that a large portion of the party's base was aligning itself with the strategy of the soberanistas, with the \\"Yes\\" option edging \\"No\\" and the ELA Soberano gathering early numbers of 42% (versus 32% of statehood) and 37% (versus 41% of statehood) respectively. Other polls placed the support at approx. 30% regardless of the fact that the option was not being officially represented by any party. Due to its nature as a non-partisan group that lacked the economic torque of political parties, ALAS' campaign was delayed until the last week of September. While the \\"Sovereign Associated Free State\\" lost some support as the PPD's campaign advanced, its percentages consistently placed it as the only option capable of numerically challenging statehood, a fact that represented the first time that a pro-sovereignty option would reach or surpass 10% of the vote. ALAS expressed that they trusted the soberanistas of the PPD to support their ideology. During the final week of campaign, Acevedo Vil√° joined this group, publicly endorsing the Sovereign Associated Free State in activities held at Caguas and Yabucoa, before posting a column explaining his reasoning in his personal website. As an ex-governor, he emerged as the de facto leader of this faction, a move that was well received by ALAS. Two other groups emerged during this week, the first was Populares Pro ELA soberano (lit. \\"PPD affiliates pro-Sovereign Associated Free State\\") composed by several PPD functionaries including Jos√© Ortiz Daliot, Julito Rodr√≠guez, N√©stor Duprey, Ariel Nazario, Agnes Crespo Quintana, Humberto Torres and Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez Quiles. The second was Amigos del ELA Soberano (lit. \\"Friends of the Sovereign Associated Free State\\") was led by Collado Schwarz and included other figures such as Antonio Casillas, Marco Rigau, Enrique Vil√° del Corral, Jaime Mart√≠, Luis Rivera Cubano, Emilio Pi√±ero Ferrer and Rafael Espasas Garc√≠a. After facing difficulties following the exit of their first candidate for governor, Enrique V√°zquez Quintana, the MUS presented their final ballot of Arturo Hern√°ndez and Mar√≠a de Lourdes Guzman, also nominating Jos√© Paralitici for the PR Senate. The group also formed alliances with several PPD candidates such as Carmen Yul√≠n, Pedro Garc√≠a, Luis Arroyo Chiqu√©s and Ram√≥n Luis Nieves. At the 2012 General Elections the soberanistas including Luis Vega Ramos, Charlie Hern√°nez, Cirilo Tirado, Fas Alzamora and Luis Raul Torres were re-elected to the legislature. The group was expanded with the addition of new members such as Nieves, Maritere Gonz√°lez, Carlos Vargas Ferrer and former Gu√°nica mayor Mart√≠n Vargas among others. The soberanistas that occupied the mayorship of several municipalities, led by Josian Santiago, Isidro Negr√≥n, Pedro Garc√≠a and Miranda Torres, retained their positions. Carmen Yul√≠n scored what was described as the \\"upset of the elections\\", defeating Jorge Santini to become mayor of San Juan. However, in the race for Resident Commissioner, Cox Alomar lost to Pedro Pierluisi by 1.07%. Garc√≠a Padilla was elected governor over Fortu√±o with a 0.63% difference. The \\"Sovereign Free Association\\" option finished second in the status referendum by gathering 33.34% (449,679) of the valid votes. However, the other half of the PPD affiliates followed the strategy supported by Garcia Padilla, leading to 480,918 blank votes. The \\"No\\" (to continuing under the Territorial Clause) option defeated the \\"Yes\\" option 54% to 46%. Through Delgado, ALAS expressed satisfaction saying that the once diffuse free association movement was beginning to unify and saying that had a significant portion of the PPD's not followed the instructions to abstain, the option would have defeated statehood. The governor-elect named Juan Eugenio Hern√°ndez Mayoral to direct the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration (PRFAA) and had previously retained his brother in the position of Secretary of International and Federal Affairs. On the other hand, Garc√≠a Padilla's designated David Bernier to the office of Secretary of State of Puerto Rico in what was considered both strategy, diverting a potential challenger, and also a move to appease the free association movement. Despite never stating his political ideology in public, Bernier's was assumed to sympathize with the soberanistas, especially following his work to promote Puerto Rico's sports sovereignty while serving as president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee. As Secretary of State, he established a campaign for the internationalization of Puerto Rico. During his first year, Bernier secured Puerto Rico's return to CEPAL, established a school of diplomacy and supervised alimentary sovereignty projects that restarted the cultivation of rice and other crops after decades. This was further complemented by moves that reaffirmed Puerto Rico's fiscal autonomy and commercial agreements with several countries. However, Bernier admitted that his internationalization efforts were done within the limitations of the territorial Commonwealth and as such, were generally done with nations allied to the United States. Throughout 2013, he also made arrangements to join UNESCO, with Vega Ramos presenting a supporting project. On January 2, 2013, Luis Vega Ramos presented P.C. 210, a bill supporting the organization of the Constituent Assembly, on behalf of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico. On January 30, 2013, the at-large seat acquired by Colberg Toro in the elections was left vacant. Among the group that filed candidacies for the vacancy was Luisa G√°ndara, Acevedo Vil√°'s wife and a soberanista herself, who won by gathering 174 out of 202 votes against Antonio Cruz Domenech and Carlos Rechani. In April 2013, after the Obama administration presented a budget including 2.5 millions to cost the education campaign of a future status process, Garc√≠a Padilla reaffirmed his support for the territorial Commonwealth and discarded the Constituent Assembly supported by the soberanistas. He repeated this stance at the Anniversary of the Constitution, where he promoted an \\"autonomous development\\" within the pre-existent territorial model. While the conservatives supported waiting for Obama's budget to get approved, the soberanistas launched their own strategy. 14 soberanistas were joined by PROELA in requesting an opinion supporting the Constituent Assembly to the UN's Decolonization Committee. A group led by Cirilo Tirado and which included Antonio Fas Alzamora, Maritere Gonz√°lez, Mart√≠n Vargas and Ram√≥n Luis Nieves among others announced the imminent presentation of a Constituent Assembly bill. The conservative leadership expressed that they did not support the initiative, claiming that Garcia Padilla wanted 2013 to end before taking further actions to attend the status issue. On that same day, Cox Alomar revealed that the attenuation of his pro- sovereignty discourse during the campaign was done strategically, so that there were no contrasts between candidates, and noted his belief that the territorial Commonwealth's economic model had run its course. A week later, Luis Vega Ramos, Luis Ra√∫l Torres, Carlos Bianchi, Carlos Vargas Ferrer, Luisa G√°ndara and Charlie Hern√°ndez presented a speech before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee supporting a Constituent Assembly. In July 2013, ALAS entered a period of restructuration following the death of Luis Delgado. On July 1, 2013, conservative Eduardo Ferrer relinquished his position of Representative at-large for the PPD, formally opening a vacancy at the PR House for the PPD. The party announced that the position would be filled with the vote of the General Council's delegates during a special election. Only five candidates made the cut to be on the final ballot, Claribel Mart√≠nez Marmolejos, Yasm√≠n Mej√≠as, Carlos Rechani, Darlene Reyes and Manuel Natal Albelo. Of them only Natal was openly soberanista and his bid was considered difficult, since it placed him in direct conflict with the conservative leadership. The special election took an ideological emphasis after Garc√≠a Padilla dismissed the free association movement, by saying that they \\"are not a wing, but rather a few feathers\\", also iIllustrating his opposition to the faction by publicly supporting the seemingly neutral Mart√≠nez. The conflict was further exacerbated by the fact that Garc√≠a Padilla could not define what constituted the specifics for an \\"enhanced\\" territorial Commonwealth in a public hearing before the US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 13 soberanistas presented their own exposition, separate from the stance of the governor. During these hearings, the committee's president Ron Wyden expressed his belief that an \\"enhanced\\" territorial Commonwealth was unconstitutional, and its vice-president Lisa Murkowski noted that she only supported \\"valid options\\". While Carmen Yul√≠n demanded respect for the free association movement, Vega Ramos, Tirado and Fas Alzamora requested a return to the ELA Soberano, noting that it remained the only viable \\"non territorial, non colonial\\" development of the Commonwealth. The incident repercuted within the PPD's Youth Organization, with its vicepresident Julio Jos√© Prieto demanding an apology only to be rebuffed by its president, Elius Vick, who also endorsed Mart√≠nez. Natal indirectly referred to this event, adopting the slogan, \\"Quills have written the best chapters of our history.\\" When Hern√°ndez Col√≥n claimed that the group was still small, fellow conservative Jaime Perell√≥ disagreed, admitting that the wing had notably expanded with time. Subsequently, Tirado's group drafted a resolution in support of the Constituent Assembly and expressed their intention to present it before the party's base at the PPD Convention scheduled for August 18, 2013. In the days leading to the special election, the PPD's leadership strengthened its campaign to secure the votes for Mart√≠nez, including public support from Eduardo Bhatia, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and Perell√≥, Speaker of the House. Carmen Yul√≠n also supported her nomination. Public reports claimed that the PPD's conservative leadership was aggressive in its support campaign for Mart√≠nez, even offering jobs to the delegates in exchange for their votes. The special election took place on August 14, 2013, with Natal defeating Mart√≠nez with a margin of 175 to 131, with 20 votes being divided between the other candidates. Afterwards, Yul√≠n explained her support, revealing her knowledge that Mart√≠nez also sympathized with the soberanistas but had opted to keep it a secret. At the PPD Convention, the soberanistas reunited with Garc√≠a Padilla in private to discuss the Constituent Assembly resolution. After a period of negotiations that lasted over ten hours, Tirado allowed the proposal to be presented without directly referencing that the option presented by the PPD had to be \\"non colonial [and] non territorial\\". However, the language that established the automatic inclusion of past resolutions included the ELA Soberano and post-Enmienda Vizcarrondo resolutions by default and remained unchanged, essentially establishing the same proposal without directly stating so. The following day, Tirado's group presented its bill to hold a Constituent Assembly before the Senate of Puerto Rico. Despite this, Tirado also presented a second Constituent Assembly project on behalf of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico. Sister project P.C. 1334 was presented by a group led by Luis Vega Ramos and Carlos Vargas in the PR House of Representatives. Natal's first official action in the legislature was to serve as cosponsor of this bill. Acevedo Vil√° supported the move, but recommended that the process was renamed \\"Status Assembly\\", to avoid the confusion that it intended to modify the Constitution of Puerto Rico. The PIP went on to draft its own Constituent Assembly proposal which was introduced by Maria de Lourdes Santiago in the PR Senate, with a sister project being presented by the PPD in the PR House since the PIP did not have representation in the lower house. On December 13, 2013, Wyden and Murkowski sent letters to the leaders of the PPD, PIP and PNP, stating that the \\"enhanced [territorial] Commonwealth [was] not viable\\". While the conservatives minimized these expressions, the soberanistas requested internal discussion to retake the pursue of a \\"non territorial, non colonial\\" development to the Commonwealth. All of the Constituent Assembly bills were to be evaluated in the public hearings of a bicameral Joint Commission, headed by √Ångel Rosa in Senate and Jos√© Varela in the House. However, the approval of 2.5 millions for a referendum overseen by the US Department of Justice in the Obama administration's budget led to a pause in actions. Despite the development, the soberanistas felt that a Constituent Assembly should take place first, serving as the negotiation table between Puerto Rico, the US Department of Justice and Congress, with the viable options that emerged from this collaboration being voted for in a referendum. After several months of inactivity, Garc√≠a Padilla revived the Joint Commission by requesting it to evaluate both alternatives and to offer specific recommendations. Other movements and activism In 2002, Julio Muriente of the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (MINH) a moderate pro-independence group, argued that if the free association movement gained prominence within the PPD, it was only a matter of time until the inmovilism surrounding the status debate was vanquished. Historian √Ångel Collado Schwarz also created a radio show, where he discussed several historical events and topics, often discussing their relation to the status issue and sovereignty. The artistic class instead opted to support free association in their own medium, without directly entering the political arena. The most notable example was actor V√≠ctor Alicea whose character, Epifanio Gonz√°lez Villamil, had become an unofficial mascot to the PPD throughout the years. In 2009, after portraying the character as a fanatical follower of the PPD without taking a stance in the ideological struggle for more than two decades, Epifanio declared himself a soberanista. Alicea then began citing Miranda Mar√≠n, Cordero and Aponte as examples for the current leaders to follow. This move was made official with a \\"welcome card\\" issued by Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, Luis Vega Ramos and Charlie Hern√°ndez. The character also ran a tongue-in-cheek gubernatorial primary campaign within the PPD. He adopted the slogan Soberano y bonitillo pa' sacar a to' esos pillos (lit. \\"Sovereign(sic) and good lookin' to kick out all those thieves\\") which he employed in a faux campaign. Non partisan demonstrations include that of Miguel Rodr√≠guez, who on February 2, 2014, began an impromptu manifestation in front of La Fortaleza in support of free association, returning to the original vision of the PPD and of Miranda Mar√≠n's pro- sovereignty project.

The grand opening of the park took place on November 16, 2018. The park is Haichang Ocean Park Holdings' second theme park in the country. Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park is themed to the ocean and its marine life and features rides, animal exhibits, an onsite hotel, and shows. Half of the park is themed to a tundra environment, which includes a conspicuous snow-covered mountain, while the other half of the park is themed to a tropical environment, which includes an equally conspicuous volcano. The two halves are connected by a gondola lift and two large pedestrian bridges that cross a canal. The theme park's flagship attractions include a launch roller coaster, a whale shark exhibit, a river rapids ride, and a killer whale show and exhibit.  History  Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park has been in development since at least 2012. When plans for the theme park were initially revealed, the park was originally going to be located on a long, narrow area of land on the east side of Dishui Lake. In the early planning stages, securing the land and government permissions was so critical to Haichang that they hired three different entertainment design firms, including Romero VanRell Jeng and Associates and Legacy Entertainment, at full-fare to design completely different parks, and then let the local officials decide which design they preferred. Eventually Legacy Entertainment's design was selected, and then that design was later adapted to fit the park's new location on the west side of Dishui Lake. The theme park's groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 29, 2015. Trial operations of the theme park began on October 1, 2018.

He arrived in Australia from England at the age of 19, and also lived for periods in Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales. His diaries and published books of his reminiscences provide detailed observations on colonial life in Australia and its personalities. Early life Bartley was born in New Cross, London on 10 May 1830. He was orphaned as a young boy and brought up by his aunt. He attended the City of London School. Tasmania In 1849 he left England for Tasmania, sailing in the ship Calcutta for Hobart. At that time there were discoveries of gold in California, and soon after his arrival in Tasmania he made a trading voyage to San Francisco, touching at Tahiti, Caroline Island, and Honolulu en route, and entering the Golden Horn in May 1850. Returning to Launceston he had a glimpse of Norfolk Island, where the worst of Tasmanian convicts were confined. New South Wales In 1851 Bartley went to Victoria with the intention of gaining experience on a sheep station west of Geelong. Circumstances cut his stay in Victoria short, and he was soon back in Launceston, only, however, to quickly travel to Sydney. Experiences on the Turon goldfield were followed by a period during which he was a teller in the Bank of New South Wales in Sydney. Then he went travelling with sheep, and he was at Paika and Canally in November 1853, when the first navigation of the Murray River took place. He visited Melbourne in December of that year but had returned by Christmas 1853 to Sydney. Queensland Bartley's Folly in Hamilton, circa 1914 One of the illustrations in \\"Opals and agates\\", published 1892 In 1854, Bartley was attracted to \\"the outdoor life of a commercial traveller and agent in the new land of Moreton Bay [as Queensland was then known], doing the rounds of the Darling Downs and Burnett districts overy six weeks or so.\\" In February 1854 on the steamer City of Melbourne, he arrived in Brisbane, which was described as the \\"prettiest country town in New South Wales\\" (this was prior to the Separation of Queensland in 1859) . From that time onward, he resided in Queensland, and led an active life in various occupations, seeing a good deal of the country, and gathering together a wealth of information on its pioneers, its characteristics, and its resources, particularly its mineral wealth. His writings told of his knowledge and of his varied experiences. On 5 January 1858, Bartley married Sarah Sophia Barton, the daughter of stockbroker William Barton and the sister of Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia. They had two sons and three daughters together. In the 1860s Bartley built a house on the highest point in Hamilton which had unrivalled views of Brisbane and the Brisbane River. However, as the house was surrounded by dense bushland, his wife refused to live in it fearing attacks by Aboriginals leading to its nickname of Bartley's Folly, a name which persisted long after Bartley had sold the property. In 1879, Bartley objected to the continued use of the nickname, as he felt the \\"folly\\" implied a financial misjudgement on his part, whereas, taking all costs into account, he had actually made a profit of on the house. In 1892 in Brisbane, he published the book \\"Opals and Agates\\" which was based on his diaries and provided chatty sketches of people and events. On 10 March 1894 Bartley, who had previously resided with his son for two-and-a-half years, left Brisbane for Sydney to secure subscribers to a second book to be entitled \\"Pioneers of Queensland,\\" which he intended publishing shortly. However in early July 1894 in Sydney, he suffered from an internal pain which he blamed on bad baking powder in a scone that he had eaten and it was suggested this may have contributed to his death from heart failure on 10 July 1894 at his residence Richmond House, 1 Richmond Terrace, Domain, Sydney. He was survived by his wife, one of his two sons, and by three daughters. He was buried on 11 July 1894 in Waverley Cemetery. His book \\"Pioneers of Queensland\\" was published posthumously in 1896 under the title \\"Australian Pioneers and Reminiscences\\" after being edited by John James Knight.  Legacy  Bartley's Hill () in Ascot, Brisbane is named after him. Bartley had owned the hilltop. Bartley's Folly was demolished in the 1920s to create a water reservoir on the top of the hill. Richmond Terrace was demolished in 1935 to allow the State Library of New South Wales to expand.

The encoded protein plays an important role in the assembly of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain through regulation of subunit ND1 biogenesis.  Clinical Significance  Mutations in the NDUFAF6 gene are associated with complex I enzymatic deficiency and lead to Leigh syndrome,Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM¬Æ.

The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Structure  NDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.  Function  The NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub- assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7Œ≤-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.  Clinical significance  Mutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.  Interactions  In addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein- protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.

It took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal. Coal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses. Small ships‚Äîcolloquially called 'sixty-milers'‚Äîcarried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there. During the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.  Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales  Coal was used as a fuel by the Awabakal people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \\"nikkin\\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune middens, on Lake Macquarie at Swansea Heads and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach. A group of escaped convicts led by a married couple William and Mary Bryant were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found ‚Äòfine burning coal‚Äô near a ‚Äòlittle creek‚Äô with cabbage tree palms ‚Äòabout 2 degrees‚Äô north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'. This first hand account of the discovery‚Äîwritten by one of the party James Martin‚Äîwas found in a collection of manuscripts and published in 1937. The escapees never returned to Sydney and their discovery of the coal remained unknown, until after they were recaptured at Kupang. William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but William Bligh‚Äîlater a governor of New South Wales‚Äîsaw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \\"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal‚Äîseeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England‚Äîtook some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\\". It is likely that the location was near the entrance to Glenrock Lagoon, where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery. Survivors of the wreck of the Sydney Cove reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700 km trek along the coast in May 1797. The explorer George Bass was tasked to confirm the discovery, and, in July 1797, he reported seeing a coal seam ‚Äúsix foot deep in the face of a steep cliff which was traced for eight miles in length‚Äù (Sites where coal outcrops are visible along the coast south of Sydney include Coalcliff, where coal outcrops in the sea-cliff, and near the ocean pool at Wombarra and Brickyard Point, Austinmer, where coal outcrops in the headlands.) In September of the same year, Lieutenant John Shortland reported coal outcropping on the southern side of the Hunter River‚Äîfirst known as the Coal River‚Äînear to its mouth, at what is now Newcastle. Shortland's ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô may have been prompted by an earlier report‚Äîprovided by a party of fishermen in 1796‚Äîof a river with coal, to the north of Sydney and south from Port Stephens, but he is credited with the discovery of the Hunter River and the northern coalfields. In July 1800, Captain William Reid‚Äîmistaking Moon Island for Nobby's and the entrance to Lake Macquarie at Swansea Heads for the mouth of the Hunter River‚Äîobtained his cargo of coal for Sydney from a seam outcropping in the southern headland at the lake's entrance‚Äîa headland since known as ‚ÄòReid‚Äôs Mistake‚Äô‚Äîand so accidentally revealed to the settlers the coastal coalfields of Lake Macquarie. Awabakal people had used the coal at Swansea Heads for over a thousand years. It was only upon his return to Sydney that Reid found that he had not travelled far enough north to have reached the Hunter River. Coal was also found during July 1801 by the expedition, led by Lieutenant-Colonel William Paterson, to the Hunter Valley inland from Newcastle. This area would later become the vast South Maitland Coalfields. The discovery of the western coalfields did not occur until after the Blue Mountains had been crossed in 1813. Coal outcrops low in the cliffs of some valleys of the Blue Mountains and on their western side near Lithgow. William Lawson found coal near Mt York in the area later known as Hartley Vale, in 1822. Apart from local use, western coal could not be exploited until the railway from Sydney crossed the Blue Mountains in 1869, and soon after that there were mines in the area around Lithgow. That coal had been found so readily, by colonial settlers with no experience of mining and little knowledge of their new country, so soon after the first European settlement, implied that the resource was widespread and plentiful. That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales. Coal is still being mined within the Sydney Basin more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction‚Äîfor the export market‚Äîthat will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st century.  Reasons for the trade  = Coal for Sydney = Coal was needed in Sydney to feed the production of town gas (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney. Coal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only very limited mining activity in Sydney. The coal seams of the Sydney Basin outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45 km south of Sydney at Helensburgh, is the closest commercially viable coal mine. Given the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the north and south were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of Sydney Harbour and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example Coalcliff (up to 1910) and the Wallarah Colliery at Catherine Hill Bay. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations‚Äîfor example wagons without air brakes‚Äîand operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others. Coal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers. After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader. Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont. The New South Wales Government Railways were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships. Four of the electrical power stations in Sydney‚ÄîBunnerong on Botany Bay, and White Bay, Pyrmont and Ultimo on Sydney Harbour‚Äîwere supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access. Two of the power stations‚ÄîUltimo and White Bay‚Äîinitially were operated by the railways and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed. The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the Balmain Power Station came by sea. = Coal and coke for the other states = In parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.  Ships  258x258px = The ‚Äòsixty-milers‚Äô = Coal was carried to Sydney in ships known as ‚Äòsixty-milers‚Äô. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea‚Äîin nautical miles‚Äîfrom the Hunter River to Sydney. The heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade. = The Interstate ships = There was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades. The interstate ships were larger than most 'sixty-milers' and making longer voyages needs different crewing arrangements and larger coal bunker capacity.. = The ship owners and operators = In the earlier years of the trade, there were many owners and operators, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal- mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ), The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and Howard Smith Ltd) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated. In the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, Howard Smith took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company McIlwraith McEachern, owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank' (Mortlake Bank, etc.) Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the Hexham Bank may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners McIlwraith McEacharn. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the Corrimal became the Ayrfield. In contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship- owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.  Coal ports & operations  = Northern Coalfields ‚Äî Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region = Coal from the northern coalfields was loaded at Hexham on the Hunter River, Carrington (The Basin, The Dyke) near Newcastle, on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at Catherine Hill Bay. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of Morpeth, and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at Swansea Heads. The coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the Hunter. The first ‚Äòpermanent‚Äô mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804. When Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. Commissioner Bigge had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the Australian Agricultural Company that made coal mining a monopoly of that company. One other company was able to persuade the government to allow it to mine coal from 1841, the Ebenezer Colliery at Coal Point on Lake Macquarie.Lambton Coliery in 1886, with rakes of empty 'non-air' wagons in the foreground. (Photographer: Ralph Snowball)The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the Brown family, who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields. At the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the Australian Agricultural Company, J & A Brown, Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian (Lambton Colliery). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \\"the Vend\\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.260x260px Many collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good- quality coal were moved to completely different collieries. Most mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were government lines and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes. At their peak, there were 13,000 of these ‚Äònon- air‚Äô wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and ‚Äònon-air‚Äô wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the Richmond Vale Railway closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons. Large letters on the side of the wagon identified the owner, and small letters its capacity.  The Hunter River ports  Ships bound for the river ports of Newcastle (Port Hunter), Carrington, Hexham and Morpeth had first to enter the river mouth between Nobby's Head and Stockton.Shipping coal at Newcastle c.1878. Steam-cranes are lifting the removable hoppers from the rail wagons. The building in the left background is the alt= The mouth of the Hunter was difficult for sailing ships heading south to Sydney. Sailing ships leaving port could not negotiate the east-north-east facing channel leaving the river, when winds favourable to a southern passage were blowing. From 1859, these ships were towed out by steam tugs and the situation improved. The construction of the breakwater and land reclamation between Nobby's Head and Newcastle increased the safety of the port. Map of Newcastle in 1868. The locations of coal staithes and the six steam cranes on the Government Wharf (Queens Wharf) are shown. Just to the north of the river mouth is the notorious Oyster Bank, actually a series of shifting sandbanks. At least 34 vessels were lost on the Oyster Bank. Construction of the northern breakwater somewhat reduced the hazard to shipping entering the river. Around the same time as the northern breakwater was built over the Oyster Bank, a southern breakwater was extended from Nobby's on the southern side of the river. The shallowness of the entrance to the Hunter River continued to be a limitation on shipping into the 1920s and a hazard during bad weather. Work continued to improve the river mouth, culminating in the excavation of a deep channel 600 feet wide, with 27 feet of water depth, effectively removing the rock bar at the river's mouth. The improvements to the river entrance were a major engineering project for their time and a paper on the work won a Telford Premium award from the Institution of Civil Engineers for Percy Allen in 1921. = Newcastle (Port Hunter) = Coal was shipped from Newcastle to Sydney, from around 1801 onward. Initially mines were located in what is now the inner-city of Newcastle and coal was loaded from wharves on the southern bank of the Hunter River. Newcastle was the main port, during the time of the Australian Agricultural Company's monopoly on the mining of coal (1828‚Äì1847). The A. A Co. built the first rail line in Australia, from its mines to the Newcastle port. By the 1860s, Newcastle was a busy coal port with both the privately-owned coal staiths and the government-owned Queen's Wharf in operation. The Queen's Wharf was connected to the Great Northern Railway‚Äîopened as far as East Maitland in 1857‚Äîand had six steam cranes used for loading coal. The westernmost staithes were the privately-owned staithes of A.A. Co., which were connected to their private railway line. The stathes to their east were connected to the Great Northern Railway and to the Glebe Railway. With the completion of the port at nearby Carrington and the end of coal mining in Newcastle itself, the importance of the old port of Newcastle as a coal port, declined. Steam cranes were relocated from Newcastle to the Dyke at Carrington. = Morpeth = Morpeth c.1865, during its heyday as a river port. (Unknown engraver, Illustrated Sydney News, 16 October 1865, Page 5.) The river port at Morpeth on the Hunter River was used to load coal mined in the Maitland area by J & A Brown from around 1843. Coal was also needed to recoal steamers at the port. Although it lies far downstream from the tidal limit, Morpeth was the effective head of navigation of the Hunter, because farther upstream there were many large bends in the river between Morpeth and Maitland. Aside from greatly increasing the distance by water to Maitland, these bends were difficult for vessels to navigate. It also lay just upstream of the confluence of the Hunter River and the Paterson River, below which the river broadens. Morpeth had been a river port from the 1830s. East Maitland to Morpeth Railway Line showing the location on the coal staiths and the siding. Note the bends in the river above Morpeth. The importance of Morpeth as a port began to decline, once the railway from Newcastle reached East Maitland in 1857. A branch railway to the old port was opened in 1864. There were coal staiths and a railway siding for these at Morpeth, These new staiths were still unfinished in early 1866. Once completed, the new Morpeth staithes were rarely used. By the late 1870s, little coal had been loaded there and, by the late 1880s, the coal staiths were in a derelict and dangerous condition. Construction of the Morpeth Bridge, downstream of the staiths, in 1896 to 1898, ended any possibility of their revival, as only very small steamers could pass under it. Morpeth continued as a port but mainly for agricultural products. Morpeth was disadvantaged by its distance up river, the shallowness of the river, and the impact of river floods. It was overtaken, as a coal port, by the downstream river ports at Newcastle, Hexham, and Carrington, which had better railway connections to the coalfields, could handle greater volumes and larger vessels, had better port facilities, and were closer to Sydney. However, local interests continued to advocate coal loading at Morpeth. Regular shipping port operations at Morpeth ceased in 1931, but some shipping continued in a small way after that time. Due to wartime constraints on transporting coal by rail, in 1940, coal from Rothbury was shipped at Morpeth but not directly to Sydney; it was brought to the port by road and then sent by barge for transshipment at a downstream river port. The river gradually silted up‚Äîno longer being dredged‚Äîleaving Morpeth to fall into further decline. The branch line closed in 1953. = Carrington ‚Äî The Dyke and The Basin = pump house to the left - 1904. (Melvin Vaniman collection of photographic panoramas in the State Library of New South Wales) The port at Carrington was the largest of all the coal ports of the coastal coal- carrying trade. The Basin and the Dyke could handle larger ships and were also used for coal export and coal bunkering, as well as loading 'sixty-milers'. State Library of NSW)222x222px The area was originally a low-lying island, Bullock Island, within the estuary of the Hunter River, which was partially submerged at high tide. Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped stone ballast in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878. The Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal. The Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a pumphouse nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day. Later some electrically operated cranes were added. The hoppers of rail wagons were lifted by these cranes and the coal dumped directly into the holds of ships. = Hexham = Hexham is located on the Hunter River upstream from Newcastle. It is where the Hunter River separates into its north and south channels. Upstream of Hexham the river, although still tidal, becomes meandering and more difficult for vessels to navigate. There were three coal loaders at Hexham. Hetton Bellbird Collieries Ltd. ship loader at Hexham. It was capable of loading at 500 tons/hour. (Unknown Photographer, Newcastle Morning Herald, 25 Jan 1936, Page 7.) The most downstream loader was J & A Brown's staithes that were supplied with coal by the Richmond Vale Railway, via a right-angle crossing (across the Main North government line), from 1856 until November 1967. The next loader upstream was the R.W.Miller coal loader, located next to the Hexham Bridge, which was built in 1959 and supplied only by road. After the merger of R.W. Miller with Coal & Allied in the mid-1980s, it was used by Coal & Allied to load coal washed at the Hexham Coal Washery and destined for Sydney. This loader was closed 1988 after the closure of the washery. The most upstream loader was built in 1935 for the Hetton Bellbird Collieries and was sold to the Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company in 1956. It was supplied via the South Maitland Railway up to the East Greta Exchange Sidings (near Maitland) and from there via the Main North (government) railway to the Hetton Bellbird Sidings at the loader. The coal was dumped at a dump station and was transferred via conveyor across the main line and highway to a ship-loader. The loader was closed in 1972 and demolished during 1976. As a river port, care had to be taken so ships made use of the tides to avoid running aground in shallow Fern Bay, when laden with coal and heading downstream, via the North Channel of the Hunter, to the sea.  Lake Macquarie  Lake Macquarie could handle only very small craft due to the shallow opening of the lake to the sea at Swansea. Only the very smallest of the 'sixty-milers'‚Äîships like the Novelty, Commonwealth, and Himitangi‚Äîwere suitable. A breakwater and dredging of the channel allowed these ships to pass the shallow entrance. The South Hetton Colliery shipped coal from a wharf‚Äîprobably at Coal Point‚Äîon the western shore of Lake Macquarie. Coal was also loaded at Green Point on the eastern side of the lake. A wharf on the south side of Swansea Channel, near the Reid's Mistake Headland was used as a transhipment location for Sydney in the 1840s. There were other collieries near to the northern, eastern and western shores of the lake but these were connected to railway lines and sent their coal to Carrington and some for local consumption at the Newcastle Steelworks.NSW State Archives collection)  Catherine Hill Bay  Catherine Hill Bay was the only ocean jetty port on the northern coalfields. Coal from the Wallarah Colliery was loaded here for Sydney and Newcastle. By using an ocean jetty, this colliery could exploit the coal seams of Lake Macquarie, without ships needing to enter the Swansea Channel. The port could still be dangerous, under unfavourable weather conditions, and some ships came to grief there. It was the last port used by the coastal coal trade in 2002. Coal was last loaded for the short trip to Newcastle, where it was loaded for export. The Wallarah Collliery closed in the same year, = Southern Coalfields ‚Äî Illawarra Region = South Bulli Colliery (Date unknown, within 1900-1927) (Photographer: Broadhurst, William Henry, 1855-1927, from collection of the State Library of N.S.W.) Although lying much closer to Sydney, the southern coalfields were not developed early, due to the absence of any natural port. Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the Illawarra Escarpment and adit mining was feasible. Adits were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the Mt Kiera mine opened. Coal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at Wollongong Harbour and Port Kembla and at the ocean jetty ports: Bellambi; Coalcliff; Hicks Point at Austinmer; and Sandon Point, Bulli. Port Kembla was originally an ocean jetty port but two breakwaters were added later to provide shelter. Thirroul. (Date unknown, within 1900-1927) The wagons in the foreground are owned by South Bulli Colliery. (Photographer: Broadhurst, William Henry, 1855-1927, from collection of the State Library of N.S.W.) Loading at the southern coalfield jetty ports typically used four-wheel wagons with hoppers fixed to the frames, which were tipped into chutes that led to high staithes from which the collier alongside the jetty or wharf was loaded. At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station. This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today. Unlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives. Most of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the collieries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.  Wollongong Harbour  Wollongong Harbour in 1887. (From an engraving later published in Illustrated Sydney News, 15 October 1887, on pages 1 and 2) Belmore Basin is in the left foreground - with its coal staithes on the far-left - and the 'Tee-wharf' is in the centre. Mt Kembla is in the centre-background with Mt Kiera on the right. The rail ine from Mt Kiera can be see running from that mountain and that from Mt Pleasant running along the beach. Red Point - near the site of Port Kembla - is in the distance at the very top left. Wollongong was for a time the only safe anchorage on the southern coalfields and the third largest port in New South Wales. The coal port at Wollongong Harbour consisted of the man-made Belmore Basin and the 'Tee Wharf'. On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67. The port was connected to the Mt Kiera and Mt Pleasant Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries. Originally these were horse-drawn but later used steam locomotives. From 1875 to 1890, there was a cokeworks, which converted unsaleable fines to coke, some of which was loaded at the port for Sydney. By 1927, there was only one coal staith in operation at Wollongong. The last coal was loaded there in 1933, by which time it had been eclipsed as a coal port by Port Kembla.  Port Kembla  From 1883, coal was shipped from an ocean jetty on the beach just to the north of a rocky headland lying to the north of Red Point and Boiler's Point. This new port was named Port Kembla, after the Mount Kembla mine from where the coal was transported by rail. A second jetty belonging to the Southern Coal Company was opened in 1887, which loaded coal sent by rail from the Corrimal Colliery. In its earlier years‚Äîmuch like the other ocean jetty coal ports‚ÄîPort Kembla was exposed to rough seas during bad weather, Between 1901 and 1937, first an eastern breakwater and then a northern breakwater was constructed, resulting in a large protected and safe anchorage now known as the ‚ÄòOuter Harbour‚Äô. A new coal jetty was built to the north of the two existing coal jetties. The new coal jetty opened in 1915 and became 'No.1 Jetty', the Southern Coal Jetty became No.2 Jetty, and the Mt Kembla Jetty became Jetty No.3. By 1937, the No.1 Jetty was loading coal from all the southern mines that shipped coal by sea, except those mines still using Bellambi or Bulli. After 1952, Port Kembla was the only coal port on the southern coalfields. The No.1 Jetty remained in service until it was replaced in 1963, by a new export coal loader located on the new ‚ÄòInner Harbour‚Äô. Port Kembla remains a major coal export port.  Port Bellambi  South Bulli Jetty, Port Bellambi c1909.Sublime Point Lookout (date unknown). Sandon Point, Bulli is the first headland, in the lower half of the photograph, with Bulli Jetty just visible. The long headland in the upper half of the photograph is Bellambi and its dangerous reef. There were originally two jetties at Bellambi, the South Bulli Jetty named after the mine of the same name and the Bellambi Coal Co. Jetty used by the Model Mine at Woonoona. The South Bulli Jetty built in 1887 was on Bellambi Beach immediately to the north of Bellambi Point. The Bellambi Coal Co. Jetty (also known as the \\"Woonoona Jetty\\") built in 1889 was located on a small rocky outcrop just to the north of the South Bulli Jetty, The port had also been the site of an earlier coal jetty completed around 1858 but only used for a relatively short time. The Bellambi Coal Co. Jetty was damaged in a storm in 1898 and thereafter all coal went across the South Bulli Jetty. Coal was sent from the mines by rail to the jetty, where there were two rail tracks on the jetty‚Äîone for full wagons and the other for empty wagons‚Äîand two loading chutes (one for each hold of a 'sixty-miler'). The wagons were separated for tipping. One end of the coal wagon was raised by a steam ram, acting on a wagon axle, tipping the coal through a hinged panel in the other end. The coal then passed through a chute, directly into one hold of the ship moored alongside the jetty. In 1909, six colliers were loaded with a total of 4,500 tons in 14-hours. Bellambi was a particularly dangerous port. Bellambi Point protected the jetties from the south but its reef extends 600m to seaward and was a hazard to shipping. In total, twelve ships were wrecked at Bellambi between 1859 and 1949, of which seven ran aground on the reef. The South Bulli Jetty operated until 1952. The jetty partially collapsed in 1955 and was demolished in 1970.  Coalcliff  Coalcliff Jetty 1885 (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, 249x249px The Coalcliff Colliery, opened in 1878, was originally developed as a jetty mine. Coal from the mine, after screening, was brought directly onto the jetty. This arrangement made working the mine difficult, as there was limited storage for mined coal and only coal that could be shipped promptly could be mined. The jetty at Coalcliff was the smallest of the southern ocean jetties. It was very exposed to ocean swell, and shifting sand shoals added to the danger by changing the depth of water near the jetty. The jetty was used only by the Colliery's own 'sixty-milers' and then only in favourable weather. Storms in 1878, 1881 and 1904 caused considerable damage to the jetty, further restricting shipping operations while damage was repaired and the jetty design modified. In 1910, a shaft was opened that allowed coal from the mine to be transported by rail and the jetty closed by 1912. Although no longer operating its own jetty, Coalcliff Collieries continued to own and operate its sixty- milers, such as the Undola. This may have been so that the jetty mine's quota under the Southern Coal Owners' Agency agreement would still be allocated to the company, in addition to its new quota for the 'new' shaft mine.248x248px  Hicks Point, Austinmer  Hicks Point is a small rocky outcrop in the beach in Hicks Bay, just to the north of Brickyard Point, Austinmer, NSW. Even its name is almost forgotten today. The Hicks Point Jetty was built in 1886 for the North Bulli Coal Company's colliery at Coledale to which it was connected by rail. It was also connected by rail to the Austinmer Colliery. Brickyard Point to the south provided some shelter from southerly weather; today the area is used to launch boats. Coal was railed from the mine to the jetty in wagons with bottom opening doors, which were opened over a hatchway cut in the jetty deck. The coal flowed onto loading chutes and from there into the hold of the ship. The jetty was damaged by storms in November 1903. The North Bulli Co. won the right to ship its coal via Port Kembla in 1906. The Hicks Point Jetty was no longer needed and fell into disuse. It was destroyed by fire in 1915. steam tram motor.251x251px  Sandon Point, Bulli  The Bulli Jetty at Sandon Point was opened in 1863 and used to load coal obtained from the nearby Bulli Colliery. The Bulli Colliery was bought by BHP in 1937 and thereafter much of its coal went to the Port Kembla steelworks by rail. The Bulli Jetty was last used by ships in 1943. After closing, it was damaged by storms in 1943, in 1945 and in 1949, when the centre section of the remaining structure collapsed and stranded four fishermen at the sea-end. Some of the structure was still standing in the mid-1960s but was gone by the end of the decade.  Sydney  Darling Harbour 1900‚ÄîThe Pyrmont coal wharves are in the foreground. (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, Powerhouse Museum) Sydney was for many years heavily dependent upon a constant supply of coal for its electricity, town gas, transport and other uses, something made more apparent by the effects of industrial trouble in the coal industry in 1948-49. Within Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River, unloading facilities included the Ball's Head Coal Loader at Waverton, AGL gasworks at Millers Point (until 1921) and Mortlake, North Shore Gas Company gasworks at Neutral Bay (until 1937) and Waverton; the Manly Gasworks at Little Manly Point (Spring Cove), and the R.W. Miller bunker facility in Blackwattle Bay. There were coal wharves at Pyrmont on Darling Harbour, where coal was sometimes unloaded but, more commonly, was loaded. Some large industrial customers had their own wharves at which coal was unloaded. There was also a coal loader, the Balmain Coal Loader at White Bay, from around 1935 until it closed in October 1991, but it was only used for loading coal for the most part from the western coalfields near Lithgow. Coal was also unloaded at the Government Pier (or 'Long Pier') at Botany on the northern shore of Botany Bay. Coal lumping gangs coaling a ship from the hold of the 'sixty-miler' Bellambi, in Sydney Harbour (c.1909). = Steamship coal bunkering and export operations =  Bunkering by 'sixty-milers'  Steamships requiring bunker coal at Sydney Harbour could have their bunkers loaded directly from a 'sixty-miler' standing alongside. This bunkering operation was common, especially before the mechanised Ball's Head Coal Loader opened in 1920 and before there were mechanised coal hulks in operation. Steamship companies preferred the coal of southern coalfields, because it burned with little smoke. However, bunker coal came by 'sixty-miler' ships from the both the northern and southern coalfields. = 'Coal lumping' gangs = Inside the hold of the 'sixty- miler' workers known as 'shovellers' would shovel the coal by hand into coal baskets that were limited by regulation to a weight of two hundredweight (one- tenth of a ton, or approx. 100 kg). The coal baskets were then hoisted out of the hold of the 'sixty-miler'. A worker‚Äîthe leader of the gang, known as a 'planksman'‚Äîworking on a 16-inches wide plank suspended high above the hold of the 'sixty-miler' and level with the steamship's rail, would walk along the plank and swing the suspended basket over the steamship's rail. From there other workers‚Äîknown as 'carriers'‚Äîwould carry it on their shoulders and tip it into the steamship's bunker chutes. Inside the steamship's bunkers, other workers known as 'trimmers' distributed the coal within the bunker. The work of the winch-driver, while less physically taxing, involved great mental strain; any miscalculation in hoisting or braking, could result in death or serious injury to the others in the gang. These workers, collectively known as 'coal lumpers', may have been the most highly paid casual employees of their time, but their pay recognised the arduous, extremely dirty and highly dangerous nature of the work. Work was carried out day and night, except in wet weather, so that bunkering was reasonably fast. A complete gang of 1 'planksman', 4 'shovellers', 1 winch-driver, with 4 'carriers' and 'trimmers' could move about 9.5 tons per hour. The number of gangs that could be put on bunkering a ship was set by the receiving space of the ship and the number of planks that could be suspended from gaffs on the masts of the 'sixty-miler'. The Bellambi could suspend sufficient planks to allow twelve gangs to work, allowing a coaling rate of over 100 tons per hour if the receiving ship was of a suitable design. Such rapid coaling was not without its own hazards. The 5,524 tonne steamer Austral was being coaled‚Äîapparently without due care taken of its trim‚Äîwhen it keeled over and sank off Kirribilli Point on 11 November 1882.Australian National Maritme Museum.)The 'sixty-miler' Stockrington is on the right. A mechanised coal hulk, with two hoists, probably Sampson, is between Stockrington and the (unknown) vessel at the wharf. = Semi- mechanised bunkering by 'sixty milers' = Some 'sixty-milers'‚Äîsuch as the Stockrington‚Äîhad their own lifting gear with grabs and were capable of coaling other ships; these semi-mechanised operations continued after the loader opened at Ball's Head.  Mechanised coal hulks  Mechanised coal hulks were used on Sydney Harbour. Hulks could be loaded at an on-shore loader or from 'sixty-milers', including those with a self-discharging capability such as the Stockrington. Without propulsion of their own, the hulks were towed into position by tugboats. Once alongside the vessel receiving the coal, the mechanised coal hoists aboard the hulk were used to discharge the coal directly to the bunker chutes or bulk cargo holds of the vessel. It seems that it was common practice to coal a ship moored at a wharf, using a mechanised coal hulk with a 'sixty-miler' standing alongside (see photograph). Fortuna‚Äîstill with the stern of a former sailing ship‚Äîcoaling a liner at Circular Quay in 1923. (Unknown Photographer, Sydney Mail, 28 November 1923, Page 41) The Fortuna, a mechanised coal hulk owned by the Wallarah Coal Co., was used for coal bunkering and ship-loading on Sydney Harbour. This strange- looking vessel was a familiar sight on the harbour for the four decades between 1909 and 1949. Her equipment was steam powered, with two 60-foot high grabs on her starboard side, and she was capable of coaling a ship at a rate of 200 tons/hour. The Fortuna, was launched, in 1875, as a fully rigged, iron- hulled ship, the Melbourne, with accommodation for sixty passengers. She was sold and rechristened Macquarie in 1888 and, in 1903, rerigged as a barque. In 1905, she was sold to Norwegian interests. In 1909, she was stripped of her tall masts and figurehead‚Äîin the likeness of Queen Victoria‚Äîand was converted to a mechanised coal hulk, the Fortuna.Fortuna was also the name of an earlier coal hulk.Mechanised coal hulk, Muscoota under tow by tugs in Sydney Harbour. (William Hall collection of the Australian National Maritime Museum) By early 1925, the Bellambi Coal Company had introduced its own mechanised coal hulk, fitting an old coal hulk Samson with two coal hoists. This vessel was still working into the early 1930s at least. The coal-handling equipment aboard Sampson was powered electrically and capable of coaling at 240 tons per hour. The 'sixty miler' Bellambi (formerly Five Islands) was modified so that its holds could be readily accessed by the grabs of Sampson. After lying idle in Sydney Harbour from 1922, the barque Muscoota was sold in 1924 and converted‚Äîat the Mort's Dock, in 1925‚Äîto be a second mechanised coal hulk for Wallarah Coal Company. As a coal hulk, the Muscoota had only one coal hoist. In 1943, she was refitted and was towed to Milne Bay, New Guinea, in early 1944, to recoal ships there. She was involved in an accident with a Dutch steamer during a storm, following which she was towed to nearby Discovery Bay, where she sank slowly.  The Ball's Head Coal Loader  Samuel J. Hood Studio Collection of the Australian National Maritme Museum. Unknown date between 1920 and 1953) Some coal skips are visible on the metal superstructure mounted atop the timber wharf. The Ball's Head Coal Loader, at Waverton on the Lower North Shore, opened in 1920. It was owned and operated by the Sydney Coal Bunkering Co., a subsidiary of the Union Steamship Co.. It was mainly used for bunkering steamships using the port of Sydney but also supplied some coal to local hospitals and other customers needing heating coal. Coal was unloaded, from the holds of 'sixty-milers' moored parallel to the shoreline by two gantry cranes fitted with grabs‚Äîlater reduced to one crane, after the other suffered irreparable storm damage (causing the death of a crane driver) in 1940‚Äîand was deposited into a stockpile located on a raised platform constructed of sandstone and concrete. The loading operation was highly automated for its time; it used a loading system supplied by an American company, the Mead Morrison Company. Coal fell via chutes in the base of the stockpile, into skips‚Äîof four tons capacity each‚Äîthat were drawn by a continuous cable through tunnels below the stockpile and onto the loading wharf, a timber structure perpendicular to the shoreline. Thirty-three skips, running on a rail track of 20-inch gauge, were spaced along of steel cable that moved at 3 miles/hour. The system was capable of loading ships at 700 tonnes per hour. The loader was operated by the Wallarah Coal Co.‚Äîthe company that also operated the Catherine Hill Bay ocean jetty and two mechanised coal hulks on Sydney Harbour‚Äîfrom 1934 to 1964, when it closed for the first time. It was taken over by Coal & Allied Industries and reopened as a coal export terminal in 1967. In 1976, the cable loading system was replaced by a system of conveyor belts capable of loading at 1,000 tonnes per hour.Interpretative signage at the Ball's Head Coal Loader  Pyrmont Coal Wharves  There were coal wharves, at Pyrmont on the western shore of Darling Harbour, where coal was sometimes unloaded but, more commonly, was loaded. The Pyrmont Coal wharves were connected to the government rail system and land transport to and from these wharves was by rail. There were at least two coal cranes at Pyrmont by 1892. Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont. In the 1870s, coal from Bulli was unloaded from 'sixty-milers' at Sydney and then transported by rail to the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong, as there was at the time no rail connection to Bulli. = The Gasworks Wharves =  Australian Gas Light Company  Coal wharf at AGL Gasworks, Mortlake (c.1900-1927) with a 'sixty-miler' alongside. (Broadhurst, William Henry, 1855-1927, from collection of the State Library of NSW) The Australian Gaslight Company (AGL)‚Äîestablished in 1837‚Äîoperated two gasworks. The first of these at Miller's Point opened in 1841. It fronted Darling Harbour where coal was unloaded. This plant closed in 1921. A larger plant was opened in 1886 on a 32 hectare site at Mortlake on the Parramatta River. At full production, the Mortlake gasworks consumed nearly 460,000 tons of coal in a year, all of it delivered to its wharf by 'sixty-milers'. The Mortlake works alone needed about three 'sixty-milers' to keep it supplied. AGL Gasworks at Mortlake in 1937. The original coal wharf is in the foreground with the new coal wharf to the left of centre. Royal Australian Historical Society, Adastra Aerial Photography Collection The original coal wharf at the Mortlake gasworks was a T-shaped structure located at the end of Breakfast Point. The unloading arrangements at Breakfast Point were that the coal was shovelled into large metal tubs by coal lumpers working inside the holds of the sixty-miler. The tubs were lifted out of the hold by cranes on the wharf‚Äîa mix of steam and electric‚Äîand transported off the wharf in rail wagons hauled by steam locomotives. Unloading a 1000-ton 'sixty-miler', in 1920, required a total of forty-nine workers per shift: five crane drivers, five tippers, five wharfmen, two locomotive drivers, two shunters, and thirty coal lumpers. From 1937, coal unloading was carried out by grab cranes on an entirely new wharf on Kendall Bay and transported from the wharf by conveyor belt, ending the dangerous and arduous‚Äîbut well-paid‚Äîoccupation of 'coal lumping' at Mortlake.  North Shore and Manly  The North Shore Gas Company‚Äîestablished in 1875‚Äîoperated two gasworks on the Lower North Shore. The first of these was established at Neutral Bay in 1876. The second and larger works was at Waverton and was opened in 1917. In 1937, the aging plant at Neutral Bay was closed. Both these plants had wharves for unloading coal. The Waverton plant was dominated by a massive enclosed coal store. In 1943, the gas mains of the Australian Gaslight Company and the North Shore Gas Company were interconnected to allow either company to supply the other company's customers, in case of wartime damage to one gasworks. There was a gasworks at Little Manly Point. The operator of this gasworks, Manly Gas Company Limited, was taken over by the North Shore Gas Company in 1938, but continued to make gas at the Manly site. Coal was unloaded at a wharf on the Spring Cove side of the site. = Blackwattle Bay coal wharves and depots = Howard Smith coal bunkers at Blackwattle Bay, with a 'sixty-miler' alongside (State Library of South Australia). Blackwattle Bay is an inlet lying between the Pyrmont Peninsula and Glebe Point to the east of Rozelle Bay. Blackwattle Bay was once much larger in area. The shallow part of the inlet‚Äîthen known as Blackwattle Swamp‚Äîwas filled in, in the late C19th, to create what is now Wentworth Park. There were three coal depots at Blackwattle Bay, located between the reclaimed shoreline and Pyrmont Bridge Road. Coal arrived by sea on 'sixty-milers' and was distributed to resellers and other customers by road transport. The most easterly was Wharf 21, operated by Jones Brothers Coal Co.. It opened around 1926, after Jones Brothers expanded their operations and relocated, from Darling Harbour at the bottom of Bathurst St. In its final form, this installation consisted of a timber wharf‚Äîwith ships berthing parallel to the shoreline‚Äîa gantry crane with a grab for unloading, and a bunker structure. The first level of the bunker structure was made of concrete and brick and it had a timber superstructure as its second level. The two long edges of the bunker structure carried rails for the travelling gantry crane. It appears that the coal bunker structure and gantry crane dated from around 1951. West from Jones Brothers was R W Miller & Co.'s wharf‚Äîperpendicular to the shoreline‚Äîand further west was Wharf No. 25, the business of Howard Smith Ltd. The Howard Smith coal wharf was already in operation by 1922. The area at the head of Blackwattle Bay, adjacent to the coal wharves, was used for the unloading construction aggregate‚Äîfrom the 'Stone Fleet' ships‚Äîand timber. = Other customers for coal on Sydney Harbour = Lever Brothers factory (February 1939) Coal dump, rail line, and a tipping wagon used to bring coal from the wharf. (Hood, Sam, 1872-1953, from collection of the State Library of NSW) Some industrial customers had their own wharves at which coal could be unloaded. Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) at Pyrmont had grab cranes for unloading raw sugar in bulk, which could also be used to unload coal‚Äîfrom 'sixty-milers'‚Äîor other bulk cargoes when necessary. Cockatoo Island Dockyard had a coal wharf and two coal bunkers, on the south- western side of the island immediately to the north of the Sutherland Dock. Coal was used as fuel by the powerhouse that supplied Cockatoo Island's electricity, including power for the dock pumps. The Nestl√© chocolate factory at Abbotsford had a wharf with a coal bunker (located at the water-end) for the coal used to power its boilers. Coal for the Balmain Power Station was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 The Lever Brothers factory, on White Bay at Balmain landed coal as well as copra at its wharf. Coal was distributed by coal lighters (or barges); the R.W. Miller company had its origins in operation of coal lighters on Sydney Harbour. Some coal during the period from 1897 to 1931 was sourced locally from the Balmain Colliery and distributed by coal lighter. The Balmain Colliery had a wharf at which ships took on bunker coal. = Botany Bay = Although far less important than Sydney Harbour as a coal port, some coal was unloaded at the 'Government Pier' (or 'Long Pier')‚Äîconstructed in 1885‚Äîat Botany on the northern shore of Botany Bay, near where Hill Street joins Botany Road today. The coal unloaded here was for nearby industrial users. Coal for the nearby Bunnerong Power Station‚Äîopened in 1929‚Äîcame by rail. Botany Bay was, in those days, a shallow port with sandbanks and could only be used by smaller ships.  Decline and end of the trade  Lake Macquarie ceased to be a coal port by the 1940s. The Swansea Channel was no longer dredged after the 1930s, and could no longer be used by even the small steamships that had used Lake Macquarie as a port. The coastal coal carrying trade from the northern part of the southern coalfields ended relatively early, as the southern coalfield ocean jetties closed; the last two were the Bulli Jetty, (closed 1943) and the South Bulli Jetty at Bellambi (closed in 1952). Coal was last shipped from Wollongong Harbour in 1933. The remaining coastal trade from the southern coalfields used the one remaining port, Pt Kembla, and continued until the 1960s. Pt Kembla is now a coal export port. The demand for bunkering coal declined, as coal-fuelled steamships became less common in the 1950s and 1960s. The mechanised coal hulk, Fortuna, was converted to a coal barge in 1949. She ceased working altogether in 1953, and was towed to Putney Point and later scrapped. In 1949, the wharves at Pyrmont were reconstructed and coal loading operations moved to White Bay at the Balmain Coal Loader. The Ball's Head Coal Loader, which was mainly used to load bunker coal, ceased being used in 1963 and closed, for the first time, in 1964. The Manly Gasworks at Little Manly Point closed in 1964. Balmain Power Station closed in 1965. 31 December 1971 was a critical turning point; the huge Mortlake gasworks ceased making town gas from coal. Petroleum replaced coal as a feedstock for town gas-making, and oil refinery gas was purchased to supplement supply, during the interval until Sydney's gas was converted to natural gas in December 1976. Although the Waverton gasworks site continued to be used until 1987, gas-making using coal ceased in 1969 when the plant was converted to use petroleum feedstock. All town gas making operations ceased with the conversion of the North Shore to natural gas. The North Shore Gas Company became 50% owned by AGL by 1974 and became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1980. 247x247px In the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in the use of coal as hospital and industrial heating converted to other energy sources, as awareness of air pollution caused by burning black coal increased. Heavy fuel oil, a by-product of local oil refining operations in Sydney, became more available as an alternative fuel to coal for brickmaking that was cleaner-burning and less bulky to transport and store. The government-owned railway network stopped using coal, once it had retired the last of its steam locomotives in 1973. From the mid-1950s through the 1960s there was a huge downturn in the coal industry, resulting in many mine closures, a number of company mergers‚Äîforming the Coal & Allied Industries group‚Äîand the rapid decline of the huge South Maitland coalfield that fed the port at Hexham. The privately-owned Richmond Vale Railway to Hexham closed in September 1987. The three coal loaders at Hexham closed in 1967, 1973 and 1988 respectively. The last ship to load coal at Hexham was the MV Camira in May 1988. At Blackwattle Bay, Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd took over the R.W.Miller wharf, in 1960, and later bought Jones Brothers Coal Co., taking over operation of Wharf 21 and its coal bunker in 1972. The coal unloader, at Blackwattle Bay, closed during the 1980s, likely soon after the closure of the last loader at Hexham. Coal and Allied relinquished their lease on the Blackwattle Bay coal wharves in 1995. The 'sixty-miler' MV Stephen Brown was donated by its owners, Coal and Allied, to the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, Tasmania, in April 1983. Although local demand for coal was falling, demand in the export market increased particularly after the Oil Crises of 1973 and 1979. In 1976, the Ball's Head Coal Loader, reopened as an export trans-shipment terminal. After 1976, most of the coal moved by the few remaining 'sixty-milers' was destined for export. The last 'sixty-miler' to carry coal to Sydney‚Äîthe MV Camira built in 1980‚Äîceased operating the run around 1993, with the final closure of the Ball's Head Coal Loader in that year marking the effective end of the coastal coal-carrying trade to Sydney. The MV Camira was sold in 1993 and converted to a livestock carrier. During the 1980s, the development of Newcastle as a bulk coal export port resulted in a revival of coastal coal shipping, this time to Newcastle. Purpose built in 1986, a new self- discharging collier the MV Wallarah‚Äîthe fourth collier to bear the name and, at 5,717 gross tonnage, far larger than a true ‚Äòsixty-miler‚Äô‚Äîcarried coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle, where it was unloaded for export at the Port Waratah Coal Loader, Carrington. This last echo of the coastal coal-carrying trade ended on 22 July 2002.  Remnants  Shell of the Carrington Pumphouse (February 2008). Disused Jetty at Catherine Hill Bay (January 2006) The Dyke and the Basin are still part of the enlarged Port of Newcastle. The last of the hydraulic cranes at The Basin were demolished in 1967 to make way for a modern export coal-loader but the bases for fixed cranes 7, 8, 9 and 10 survive. The associated Carrington Pump House building still survives in Bourke St Carrington, although its equipment was removed and its chimneys demolished long ago. Morpeth is now a picturesque riverside town; the decline of the port and other local industries has resulted in the preservation of many of its 19th-Century buildings. The wharves and most of the port's warehouses are gone. The Outer Harbour at Port Kembla and its breakwaters remain, as a part of an enlarged port that has a major coal export terminal‚Äîlocated on the newer Inner Harbour‚Äîbut all the old coal jetties are gone. Pelaw Main in 2007. All the ocean jetties are gone, except the disused jetty at Catherine Hill Bay. Also at Catherine Hill Bay is the Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct, although it is now somewhat compromised by approval in 2019 of a housing development on land behind the headland where the jetty is. Bushland in nearby coastal areas is protected as the Wallarah National Park. Coalcliff jetty mine site is visible beneath the Sea Cliff Bridge. Iron dowel pins that secured the timber uprights of the wharf to the bedrock and an iron mooring ring set into in the rock are all that remain of the Hicks Point Jetty at Austinmer. The last vestiges of the Bulli Jetty were a hazard to surfers and were demolished in 1988. The nearby creek, Tramway Creek, was named for the tramway linking the old Bulli Mine to the jetty. All that remains of Port Bellambi is wreckage of ships. The boiler of the Munmorah can still be seen on the reef at low tide. Wollongong Harbour has been a fishing port, since the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company ended freight services in 1948. Belmore Basin survives including the upper-level where the coal staithes once were located, as does the concrete and iron base for the crane of the former 'Tee- Wharf'. Two cuttings, at the southern end of North Wollongong Beach, on the Tramway Shared Path, are remnants of the rail line from the Mt Pleasant Colliery that was removed in 1936.Interpretive sinage at Wollongong Harbour and Tramway Shared Path The old bridge over the Hunter River at Hexham opened in 1952 has a lifting span‚Äîno longer in use‚Äîwhich allowed the ‚Äòsixty milers‚Äô to access the one coal loader that was upstream of the bridge's location. The Stockton Bridge opened in 1971 has a 30m clearance to allow ships to use the North Channel of the Hunter River that leads to Hexham. The Hexham coal loaders are all gone. The last of the Coal & Allied facilities at Hexham‚Äîthe Hexham Coal Washery‚Äîwas demolished in 1989. Only a small part of the South Maitland Railway remained in use for coal traffic by 2018. A very few of the 13,000 'non-air' coal wagons and some of the steam locomotives of the northern coalfields survive at the Richmond Vale Railway Museum.The museum makes use of a short remaining part of the former Richmond Vale Railway. The NSW Rail Museum has on display two 10-ton 'non-air' four-wheel wagons; one J & A Brown wagon from the northern coalfields and one South Bulli wagon from the southern coalfields.Entrance to Wollongong Harbour and base of the Tee-Wharf steam crane, with the northern portion of the Illawarra Escarpment in the background (August 2018). The former site of the coal wharves at Pyrmont on Darling Harbour is now occupied by the Australian National Maritime Museum. Parts of the Ball's Head Coal Loader at Waverton have been converted to public space‚Äînow known as the Coal Loader Centre for Sustainability‚Äîwith the derelict loading wharf remaining safely off-limits. Ships are still moored at the unloading wharf, but the ships now are ones undergoing restoration. One of the tunnels beneath the stockpile platform still has a movable chute used by the original loading system. The site has interpretive signage that provides information covering in detail the history of the site.Belmore Basin, Wollongong, with the former locations of two of the coal staiths visible in the stone and concrete wall in the background (August 2018). The Blackwattle Bay coal facility and its gantry crane were largely intact, in 2002, when a master plan for the foreshore area envisaged their retention and adaptive reuse. The gantry crane was demolished at some time before 2007. A partial collapse of the coal bunker occurred as a result of a downpour on 12 February 2007 and some of the damaged structures were demolished in 2007.

Remaining buildings of the old gasworks at Waverton (October 2018). By September 2018, only a little of the Blackwattle Bay coal facility survived. The site is derelict and overgrown. There is a derelict brick building‚Äîthe former gate-house‚Äîand one side of the coal bunker structure. The timber wharf is gone although the reclaimed land where the rest of the bunker stood remains. There are rusted remains of some coal handling equipment, including grabs and pieces of gantry crane structure. The NSW Government announced in 2016 that the Sydney Fish Markets would be relocated to the old wharf area adjoining Pyrmont Bridge Rd. That would allow the existing Fish Market site‚Äî in the shadow of the Anzac Bridge‚Äîto be redeveloped as apartment buildings. Based on what is known of the plans for the site, it appears that the remainder of the old coal facility will be demolished to make way for the new Fish Market complex. The site of the old Manly Gasworks is now a public park, Little Manly Point Park. The North Shore Gas Company site at Waverton is now mixed use, with some public open space and lots of apartment buildings; there are a few repurposed buildings from the old gasworks remaining (the Boiler House, the Exhauster House, the Carburetted Water Gas Plant and the chimney). The Mortlake Gasworks site is now given over to housing and is known as Breakfast Point. The Gladesville Bridge, opened in 1964, was designed as a high concrete arch to allow 'sixty-milers' to reach Mortlake; it replaced an earlier bridge with an opening span. The old Neutral Bay Gasworks site was used as a torpedo factory during WWII and later as a submarine base for many years, and is now in the process of being repurposed; the first stage of \\"Sub Base Platypus\\" opened in May 2018.

Its high clearance was needed to allow 'sixty-milers' to reach the AGL Mortlake Gasworks. All the foreshore industries that used coal and their coal wharves are gone, making way for residential development or repurposing. One coal bunker, the powerhouse building and its chimney remain standing on Cockatoo Island. Some piers of the old Government Pier at Botany on the northern shore of Botany Bay were still standing in 2002. The area is now part of Port Botany, which has supplanted Sydney Harbour as the main cargo port of Sydney. There is one remaining 'sixty-miler' afloat, the MV Stephen Brown, although no longer in use as a collier. She is used as a stationary training vessel by the Australian Maritime College. Wrecks of other 'sixty-milers' exist at Homebush Bay in Sydney and on the sea bed near Sydney. The mechanised coal hulk, Muscoota, lies far from Sydney Harbour, at Discovery Bay (Waga Waga), Papua New Guinea. She still carries her last cargo of coal, but is now partially coated in coral growths‚Äîthe tip of her bow above the waterline and her rudder 24 metres below‚Äîreportedly making a perfect snorkeling and dive site.MV Stephen Brown - The last 'sixty-miler' afloat, in 1987.

The barrier was proposed as a high dam near New Castle, Delaware, long, equipped with locks for the passage of shipping to Wilmington and Philadelphia. A study for the project was authorized by Congress in 1958, with engineering evaluations and public hearings by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The prime purpose of the project was to develop the lower river as a source of drinking water for communities along the lower river. Objections to the barrier included concerns about the oyster industry, shipping constraints, increased shoaling, ice formation, and most importantly, the possibility of trapping pollutants above the barrier. The project was found to be technically feasible, but not economically practical. It was not included in the final Delaware River Basin Report of 1962, which proposed reservoirs higher in the Delaware River basin, and no further action was taken. Description The location of the impoundment was set by the presence of the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal south of New Castle, which was to remain a sea-level canal. Studies examined problems of ship passage, which would necessitate a system to flush the locks with pumped water to prevent salt water contamination. The study indicated that in the absence of regular tidal flushing there would be a buildup of pollutants in the impoundment that would render the fresh water reservoir unusable. The barrier itself was proposed as a low dike built using hydraulic fill, armored against storms with concrete paving. An overflow spillway was to be set in a section of concrete structure, adjacent to four navigation locks that could accommodate vessels of more than draft. A diameter tunnel was proposed to carry water from an intake structure near New Castle at a depth of about for in populated areas, or in a cut-and-cover trench in rural areas over to Hoopes Reservoir above Wilmington. Costs were projected in 1960 to be about $345,000,000 for the barrier, and between $35,000,000 and $45,000,000 for water tunnels. Costs for an alternative intake from the reservoir behind the existing Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna River were estimated to be between $140,000,000 and $170,000,000. Annual costs were estimated in the same proportion as the differences between the projects.

Built in 1926, the Produce Terminal stretches 1,533 feet long over five blocks. It previously served as the hub for local wholesale produce businesses, as well as retail markets and art galleries. After years of sitting partially vacant, the building is in the final stages of a $62.6 million renovation by McCaffery Interests.  History  At the start of the 20th century as the iron metals industry slowly declined in Pittsburgh's Strip District, the produce industry experienced significant growth. In 1906 the rail lines were removed from Liberty Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh, and wholesale produce businesses were relocating elsewhere, and the Pittsburgh Produce Terminal was constructed to meet these new needs. Before 1900 the area of the site was a residential district known as Bayardstown, but this district was slowly transformed into warehouses for the Pennsylvania Railroad yards.Historic and Architectural Survey of the Strip District, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Lauren Uhl and Tracy Walther. Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, 1994. In 1903 the auctions for the produce was conducted straight from the freight cars. This began to change as the fruit dealers became more organized, creating United Fruit Action in 1908. In 1926 Joseph Craig, who worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, constructed all of the linear warehouses that displayed samples of incoming produce, and build the extant structure of the Pennsylvania Fruit Auction & Sales Building. Auctions were held at multiple points in this new structure, which was designed to maximize access to rail cars and the auctioning of produce. The wholesalers business was hurt by the Great Depression, the 1936 Flood, and World War II. Yet there were still 71 produce wholesalers in the Strip District in the 1950s. The decline continued still though as the growth of supermarket chains, direct purchasing, and shipping by truck all hurt the industry. In 1962 Mayor Joe Barr, along with the USDA, issued a report on the facilities in the Strip District and proposed creating a new facility in the suburbs. Following this, and the bankruptcy of Penn Central in 1970, the building was sold to Conrail. The Buncher Company then bought most of the lands, and sold them to the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1981. The URA then invested $2.5 million in rehabilitating and modifying the north fa√ßade of the building to accommodate trucking docks. However, by the mid-2000s, the terminal was no longer being used due to changes in the produce industry. In 2019, the URA reached a deal with Chicago-based McCaffery Interests to renovate the Produce Terminal into a food market and space for local businesses. Ground was broken on the project in June 2019; it is expected to cost approximately $50 million. The building was nominated in January 2013 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The Produce Terminal was built in the Art Deco and Moderne architectural styles. The building is unique in that it is the last remaining structure designed to optimize access to Pennsylvania Railroad Freight yards. This is responsible for the building being 1,533 feet long, or just over ¬º mile, so as to allow for the unloading of freight trains all along its length. The building is 155,000 square feet, and consists of 75 twenty-one foot by one hundred foot structural bays, meant for unloading and selling of merchandise. The structure itself is made primarily of a steel frame with brick masonry contrasting with stone caps.

She is a co-investigator of the Southwest Research Institute's Project ESPRESSO and was a science adviser to the science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe.  Education and early career  In 2000, she was a student in the astronomy program of the Summer Science Program and later served on its board and as a guest lecturer. McKinnon received her Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2005, attending the College of Creative Studies. There, she re-launched the Society of Physics Students chapter and led a student colloquia on science in fiction. She received her Master of Science in geophysics from the University of British Columbia in 2010. Her graduate work was about assessing and managing risk of landslides using statistical models to map their physical characteristics to better predict landslide runout and reduce the number of casualties and the extent of the damage. While looking for work after graduation, during a hiring freeze by the Canadian government, she discovered women in her field were being hired because they could be paid less than men ‚Äì which contributed to her vocal support for women and minorities in science.  Research career  McKinnon's research interests are in disaster management, preparedness, and communication, working at the intersection of scientific research, advocacy and policy. In policy, she uses expertise in both science and communication to teach science to disaster managers, revising Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) science curriculum for emergency managers as a contractor and working on several projects with Natural Resources Canada. McKinnon is a co-investigator of Project ESPRESSO, lending her expertise in terrestrial landslides and hazard mapping towards the project's goal of characterizing extraterrestrial target surfaces (asteroids, comets, and moons) and reducing other operational risks for robots and humans in space exploration. The project, which represents a consortium of seven partner institutions, was proposed in response to NASA's 2016 call for Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute nodes, and is one of four selected projects resulting from that call. She holds a joint appointment at the SETI Institute, one of ESPRESSO's partner institutions.  Science communication  McKinnon began her science communication efforts as a Master's student at UBC, after answering a call from the producers of the television show Stargate: Atlantis for a physicist who could help with accurate scientific justifications for the show's science fiction plots. After graduation, she pursued a career in science communication that included popular science writing and continuing her consulting role on the television shows Stargate: Atlantis and Stargate: Universe. More recently, McKinnon has consulted on Doomsday: 10 Ways the World Will End, No Tomorrow, Madam Secretary, and Star Trek: Discovery. In a profile with her alma mater, UCSB, she says that her interest in communication stemmed from the media's misrepresentation of a major landslide in the Pacific Northwest. She was a contributing editor for Gawker Media, providing coverage on popular science topics for io9 and later became a science writer for Gizmodo. Her bylines cover topics including space exploration, dinosaur discovery, the convergence of science and art, and disaster preparedness. Her writing is in publications including Wired UK, Smithsonian magazine, Ars Technica, and Astronomy. She volunteers for the National Academy of Sciences Science & Entertainment Exchange, providing subject matter expertise to the entertainment industry for more accurate depictions of science in the media.

Covering within a boundary perimeter, its headwaters drain across seven of the largest watersheds on the island and supply important catchment basins for water distribution to Grenadians and agrarian landscapes downstream. The forest reserve encompasses the principal peak of the Mount Saint Catherine massif‚Äîthe highest point on the island , as well as other lushly forested ridges and lesser peaks (e.g. Mount Hope), the highest waterfall in the country (Tufton Hall Waterfalls), the majority of the island's known hot springs, including the hottest geothermal spring (Hapsack Springs) and its most accessible geothermal bathing pool (Clabony Sulphur Springs). Physical Environment and Ecology The Mt. St. Catherine massif is an extensively weathered volcano that is considered dormant because it has likely not erupted since the last Ice Age. It is considered to be the only live volcano among the five volcanic centers in Grenada on account of its relatively well-preserved morphology and the presence of hot springs and fumaroles on its flanks. The forest reserve area is typical of tropical montane cloud forests, which develop in areas where clouds impinge almost continuously on tropical mountain vegetation and differ from lowland rainforests in structure (low stature, small and tough leaves, low diversity) and function (low productivity and low nutrient-cycling rates). They are considered highly endangered ecosystems on account that these forest formations are rare, fragile, and are probably disappearing faster than any other forest ecosystem in the neotropics today. Elfin/Sierra palm cloud forest on a clear day on the Mt. St. Catherine summit (840 m). The tower cables are just above the summit exit that leads to Victoriaville seen on the coast to the right The Mt. St. Catherine Forest Reserve is further representative of lowland rainforest and lower montane cloud forest, with its highland vegetation of dense tree growth comprising forest formations of Sierra palm, transitional and tall cloud forest, and Elfin/Sierra palm cloud forest, laden with ferns, mosses and other epiphytes and typical stunted woodland growth at higher exposed elevations. In the sheltered lower elevations, the forest is relatively mature, comparable to other rainforests of the island (e.g. Grand Etang and Annandale). Secondary forest growth from past cut-over rainforest is apparent surrounding lower supporting ridges and around the periphery of the reserve, with mixed-woody agriculture (particularly, agroforestry plantations of nutmeg and cacao) crossing over the forest reserve boundaries mainly on the sides of the reserve by Victoriaville and Mt. Horne. Bottom tier of Tufton Hall Waterfalls in the Mt. St. Catherine Forest Reserve The cloud-forest ecosystem in the Mt. St. Catherine Forest Reserve is a valuable water resource for Grenada. Significant amounts of rainfall and cloud-mist condensate are collected within its highland forests and dispersed downslope throughout the year. It is critically important to the overall watershed regimes on the island as the main rivers and tributaries with perennial flow in Grenada are relatively small, rainfall is highly seasonal and locally limited, and only about 10% of drinking water for the population is generated through groundwater. The Mt. St. Catherine Forest Reserve, along with other montane areas of the island, provides a range of critical watershed services, including hydrological regulation, flood control, groundwater recharge, water quality enhancement, and soil conservation. Hiking and Trails (Summit trails downloadable from Wikiloc) Hiking in the Mt. St. Catherine Forest Reserve is diverse, including 3 steep rugged routes to the top of the cloud forest and the Mount Saint Catherine summit, recreational strolling areas in scenic agroforestry settings, and challenging river trekking to geothermal features and waterfalls. The trail system leading to the forest reserve and continuing to an extent within limits of the reserve are based on old estate roads and tracks established to service crop production in the past and are generally well maintained (hiking level is easy). These may be considered more of a walk on gentle hills along a hard packed trail over a short distance (1 h or less). The main trails starting at the foot of the mountain towards the summit vary in their levels of difficulty (moderate to difficult, 3+ hours). The moderate sections of these main trails cover steep terrain with lots of elevation gain, at times over rocky and muddy parts, but are generally well worn and free of encumbering vegetation. The difficult sections of these main trails may be technically challenging (e.g. requiring the use of hands) with considerable elevation gain, often over steep rocky and muddy terrain, and would not be completed unless one is in good physical condition. Secondary trails exist off these main trails (only used in hunting) and requires bushwhacking and route-finding skills to navigate.

It has demonstrated a vehicle driving autonomously with a safety driver only in the passenger seat. To date, the company has raised approximately $77 million in funding. Drive.ai's technology can be modified to turn a vehicle autonomous. In May 2018, Drive.ai announced a pilot program in Frisco, Texas to test the company's vehicles in its first application of a passenger carrying service available to the general public. In June 2019, just days before it was set to close, the company was acquired by Apple Inc., which has been interested in the acquisition of an autonomous vehicle company for its automotive Project Titan. __FORCETOC__  History  Drive.ai was established in 2015 through Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Lab by a group of masters and PhD students from Andrew Ng's research lab. The group initially worked to develop a retrofit kit to add their autonomous driving system to existing cars. The company was seed funded by Carol Reiley for an undisclosed amount. In August 2016, the company emerged from stealth mode with $12 million in funding and became the 13th company in California to get a license to test autonomous vehicles. The company's early funding included investments by Northern Light Venture Capital, Oriza Ventures and InnoSpring Seed Fund. In June 2017, Drive.ai raised a $50 million Series B funding round led by New Enterprise Associates with participation from GGV Capital, Northern Light Venture Capital and other previous investors. As part of the funding announcement, the company also announced that scientist Andrew Ng had joined its board of directors. That same month, Lyft announced a partnership with Drive.ai to run a pilot program in San Francisco operating Drive.ai's test fleet through Lyft's platform. Drive.ai raised an additional $15 million in September 2017 including participation from Grab, a ride- hailing technology company in Southeast Asia. In May 2018, it was announced that Drive.ai was working with the Frisco Transportation Management Association and would be releasing an on-demand self-driving passenger carrying car service in Frisco, Texas during the course of an initial 6-month pilot program. It was the first public deployment of self-driving cars in Texas. The pilot program will initially use safety drivers to monitor the car's operation, but will eventually move to driverless operation with remote monitoring. A Drive.ai app will be used by riders to call rides. Initially, the program will operate as a shared service within a fixed area including retail, entertainment and office spaces using designated pickup and drop-off locations. During the trial period, Drive.ai offered public education about its self-driving technology. In October 2018, Drive.ai announced that it would launch a similar self-driving passenger carrying car service in Arlington, Texas and became the first company with revenue in the self-driving car space. The service would include three vehicles running on several routes across different parts of the city, including the AT&T; Stadium.  Technology  The company has a fleet of Lincoln MKZs, an Audi A4 and Nissan NV200s for its testing in California. In February 2017, Drive.ai released the first video footage of its technology, featuring one of its self-driving Lincoln MKZ cars navigating the streets of Mountain View, CA in the rain after dark. This marked an early recording of a self-driving vehicle operating on a fully autonomous ride at night, or in inclement weather. In May 2018, Drive.ai released a video featuring an orange Nissan NV200 driverless vehicle navigating Frisco streets. The video featured private streets as well as busy intersections and a traffic circle. It also featured a display showing the car's sensors and cameras dealing with objects on the road and highlighted operation through low-angle sunlight that would obscure typical sensors. The car's object recognition systems identify and route around other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists safely. Drive.ai's cars include screens on the outside of the car, one on the hood, one on the back, and one on each side, to communicate with pedestrians. The screens feature prompts such as \\"Passengers Entering/Exiting' or \\"Waiting for You to Cross.\\" Drive.ai collects data along the routes it will be using to create three-dimensional high-definition maps to support the self-driving technology.

During the outbreak of war in 1948, he saw military action in Operation Nachshon where he served with the Second Battalion known as Ha-portzim,Yosef Tabenkin, The Turning Point in the War of Independence (◊î◊û◊§◊†◊î ◊ë◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊™ ◊î◊¢◊¶◊û◊ê◊ï◊™), Yad Tabenkin: Efal 1989, p. 123 [Hebrew] thence in Operation Harel (when the unit then took on the name Fourth Battalion of the Harel Brigade) and, later, took part in operations known as Operation Danny. Afterwards, with renewed fighting in the fall, Tabenkin led operations in Operation Ha-Har, when he had already replaced Yitzhak Rabin as the commander of the Harel Brigade. In this final operation, he led his combatants to military victories, who, at that time, had gained the mastery of the field. Operation Nachshon's mission was to break the siege of Jerusalem by opening the Tel-Aviv ‚Äì Jerusalem road blockaded by the local Arabs and to supply food and weapons to the isolated Jewish community of Jerusalem. According to Tabenkin, two days before the end of Operation Nachshon (on 14 April 1948), the military echelon had decided to capture and destroy all Arab villages along the Tel-Aviv - Jerusalem highway which had been used as a base of operations to intercept Jewish convoys.Yosef Tabenkin, The Turning Point in the War of Independence (◊î◊û◊§◊†◊î ◊ë◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊™ ◊î◊¢◊¶◊û◊ê◊ï◊™), Yad Tabenkin: Efal 1989, pp. 74, 154‚Äì155 (ch. 4) [Hebrew]Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, O J√©rusalem, Robert Laffont, 1971, p. 369 In contrast, Operation Ha-Har was to open-up the Jerusalem Corridor south of Nahal Sorek, and to rid the area of all pockets of resistance. As Harel Brigade commander, Tabenkin was subordinate to OC Central Command, General Zvi Ayalon, who, in turn, answered to David Ben-Gurion. In May of 1948, the Harel Brigade was involved in Operation Maccabi. With only a break-away \\"diversionary force\\" of 120 men, Tabenkin had relegated the duty of capturing Mount Zion to his deputy, Uzi Narkiss, while he himself went to Operations Central Command headquarters to ask for reinforcements to secure the area once it had been captured. The delay of reinforcements forced the Brigade to retreat from Jerusalem.See p. 189 in: Tabenkin accredited himself with having designed the first armored car in the War of Independence.Uri Milstein, History of Israel's War of Independence: The first month, vol. 2, University Press of America: New York 1997, p. 137. According to Tabenkin, he brought 4,500 Jewish fighters from Cyprus, and also organized the first Jewish pilots for combat operations.See p. 90 in: In 1950, Tabenkin retired from the IDF at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Post war After the war, Tabenkin studied industrial engineering at Technion University, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in 1961. After the Six Day War, Tabenkin became actively involved in the Movement for Greater Israel, of which his father was one of its founders, and is one of 57 signatories to the \\"Greater Land of Israel\\" declaration, signed on 22 September 1967. In his native Ein Harod (Meuhad) he operated a steel factory, dealt in exports, and later operated a plywood factory in Petach Tikvah.

He served as researcher at the international secretariat of Amnesty International and is a member of the board of trustees of its local chapter. Garcia served as peace envoy and policy adviser at International Alert, a non-governmental peace-building organization working in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Garcia served as one of the framers of the 1987 Philippine Constitution and advocated for the inclusion of human rights and social justice provisions in the charter. In 1970, he co-founded the militant youth political movement Lakasdiwa (Lakas ng Diwang Kayumanggi). The movement and its distinct political ideology (Filipino Social Democracy) sought to create a nonviolent path towards social change‚Äîan alternative to the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist (MLM) Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the National Democratic Front (NDF) which called for armed struggle‚Äîdrawing from diverse sources such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Liberation Theology.  Early life  Garcia studied at the Ateneo de Manila University. Among his professors were the Filipino Jesuit Horacio de la Costa. A seminarist, he finished his degree in philosophy at the Loyola House of Studies/School of Theology. His postgraduate studies came at Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Universidad Catolica in Lima, and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City.  Career  He taught at Colegio de Mexico in the 1970s and regularly lectured at Escola de Pau (School of Peace) at Universitat de Barcelona and at the Erasmus Program on Human Rights, Migration, and Development at University of Bologna. Garcia taught political science at University of the Philippines and Latin American Studies at Ateneo de Manila University. Garcia currently serves as consultant for the formation of scholar-athletes at Far Eastern University. He has written several opinion pieces published in the online news website Rappler.  Political involvement  In 1970, Garcia co-founded the militant youth political movement Lakasdiwa (Lakas ng Diwang Kayumanggi), a nationalist and social democratic group. The movement and its distinct political ideology (Filipino Social Democracy) sought to create a nonviolent path towards social change‚Äîan alternative to the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist (MLM) Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the National Democratic Front (NDF) which called for armed struggle‚Äîdrawing from diverse sources such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Liberation Theology. Among Marxists and more radical formations, the group was derided as being moderate and bourgeois, often dismissed as \\"clerico- fascists,\\" alluding to its close ties to the Roman Catholic Church. Later, Garcia was a member of Kaakbay, a political movement against the Marcos dictatorship led by imprisoned Senator Jose W. Diokno. After the 1986 People Power Revolution where the Marcos regime was deposed, Garcia was appointed by the Aquino government as a representative in the 1986 Constitutional Commission tasked to create a \\"Freedom Constitution.\\" He served as one of the framers of the 1987 Philippine Constitution and together with youth representative Chito Gascon advocated for the inclusion of human rights and social justice provisions in the charter. Garcia later helped establish the Kilusan Laban sa Kudeta (Kilos) in 1989 during the turbulent Aquino years and participated in the Coalition for Peace in 1986, the Gaston Z. Ortigas (GZO) Peace Institute in 1989, and the Multi-Sectoral Peace Advocates and the National Peace Conference in 1990.

It is set within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness which is part of the Cascade Range. Alta Mountain is situated on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Yakima River. Climate Alta Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Alta Mountain from the north The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The Cranston Fire impacted the communities of Idyllwild and Mountain Center, as well as recreational activities in the Lake Hemet area, San Bernardino National Forest and Mount San Jacinto State Park. Over 7,000 people were evacuated due to the Cranston Fire. Events =July= The Cranston Fire allegedly was started on July 25, around noon, by Brandon M. McGlover, who allegedly started numerous fires in the region that day. By the evening, the fire had burned , with five percent containment. Over 2,000 people were evacuated, including Mountain Center, Idyllwild, Lake Hemet, a Girl Scouts camp and more. Portions of Highway 74 and Highway 243 were closed. The next day, the fire had reached approximately and was at three percent containment. Evacuations were expanded to include Cedar Glen, Fern Valley, Mount San Jacinto State Park, and Pine Cove. Numerous areas, including campgrounds, in both the State Park and San Bernardino National Forest were closed. The fire was reported to have destroyed five homes. By July 27, over 7,000 people were evacuated due to the Cranston Fire. The fire had short, active runs in the southeast area of the fire, however, good suppression efforts were made. Caltrans focused on removing debris from highways. By the next day, July 28, two firefighters were reported injured and Hamilton High School was named an evacuation center. The fire continued to grow into Garner Valley. Evacuation orders were put in place, and then lifted later that evening, for Garner Valley. Crews made significant efforts to keep the fire out of the southern and eastern parts of Idyllwild as the fire threatened fire retardant lines. Repopulation began in areas of Garner Valley and on July 29 repopulation started in Fern Valley, Pine Cove, Cedar Glen, and parts of Idyllwild. By that evening, 560 people remained evacuated and the fire had been over half contained. Twelve buildings had been damaged and five damaged. One shelter was closed. Crews focused on mopping up and securing the fire's edge and containment lines were near finished around Idyllwild. Repair began to reduce erosion and mitigate impacts to natural resources as a result of fire suppression efforts. The next day, July 31, Southern California Edison crews focused on restoring power by installing new power poles. Hazard trees were removed and light precipitation aided in fire suppression. By the evening of July 31, the fire had burned and was 89 percent contained. =August= As the Cranston Fire continued to burn into August, no new growth was reported. Teams began to be demobilized as the fire moved towards containment with mop up and suppression repair efforts in progress. Caltrans focused on removing hazardous trees on roadways while Southern California Edison focused on power restoration. Evacuation orders were lifted for Idyllwild, Pine Cove, Fern Valley, Cedar Glen and the western portion of Garner Valley up to Lake View Drive at the Lake Hemet Market. By the morning of August 2, the Cranston Fire had burned and was 92 percent contained, with 100 percent containment anticipated by August 9. On August 10, 2018, the Cranston Fire was fully contained. Impact The fire caused evacuations in residential areas, including Mountain Center, Idyllwild, Pine Cove, and Cedar Glen, as well as evacuations and closures in Mount San Jacinto State Park and the San Jacinto Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest. It also caused road closures along Highway 74 and Highway 243, impacting access to Hemet. Parts of Highway 74 and Highway 243 were later closed multiple times due to the threat of mudslides caused by the fire. Areas in the Mountain Center area were also ordered to evacuate multiple times due to this threat. Additionally, it caused numerous trail closures, including the Pacific Crest Trail. Parts of the National Forest were ordered closed until July 31, 2019. Over 7,000 people were evacuated due to the fire. Transportation Cranston Fire on July 27 Numerous portions of Highway 74, Highway 371 and Highway 243 were closed as a result of the fire, specifically in the areas of Hemet and Banning. Temporary flight restrictions were in place for the area. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway was closed for four days due to the fire.

Early life and family  Clara Jeanne Agnelli was born in Turin on 7 April 1920 to Edoardo Agnelli, a businessman and member of the Agnelli family, and Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte, a noblewoman. Her paternal grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli, was the founder of Fiat Automobiles. Her maternal grandfather was Carlo Bourbon del Monte, Prince di San Faustino. She was the sister of Countess Cristiana Brandolini d'Adda, Countess Susanna Rattazzi, Countess Maria Sole, Gianni Agnelli, Giorgio Agnelli, and Umberto Agnelli. In 1935, when Agnelli was fifteen years old, her father died in an airplane crash. Her mother died in a car accident in 1945. In November 1968 Agnellli went to the break-away state of Biafra in Nigeria to give money to secessionist leader C. Odumegwu Ojukwu on behalf of her family.  Marriages  Agnelli married Prince Tassilo zu F√ºrstenberg in 1938 when she was eighteen years old. The couple had three children, Prince Egon von F√ºrstenberg, Princess Ira von F√ºrstenberg, and Prince Sebastien von F√ºrstenberg. During her marriage Agnelli had an affair with Italian actor Giovanni Nuvoletti, whom she had met in Sestriere when she was twelve years old. She ran off with Nuvoletti and the two were eventually arrested, as adultery was illegal in Italy at the time.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clara-agnelli-zdjhf5rw7 She had to sign a legal document renouncing her relationship with Nuvoletti in return for an annuity. She continued on with the affair, which angered her brother Gianni. Once divorce was legalized in Italy, Agnelli married Nuvoletti in 1974 in a civil ceremony and moved into the Villa Papadopoli.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1988. Overview The kofun group is located on a hillside east of the centre of the city of Tsuruga facing the ocean, and consists of two separate groups, the and the . These tombs date from the 4th to 6th century AD. The tumuli were discovered during the construction of a highway bypass connecting the Hokuriku Expressway with Japan National Route 8, during which time a number of other archaeological discoveries were made, including the Yoshikawa Site, a Yayoi period settlement, and the Kotanigahora Kofun Cluster; however, neither of these sites received government protection and were totally destroyed during highway construction after a hasty compliance excavation. The Nakag≈ç Kofun Cluster itself did not receive full protection, and within the site only Mukaiyama Tombs 1, 3 and 4 and My≈çjinyama Tombs 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 are covered by the National Historic Site designation. Mukaiyama Tomb 1 was excavated several times starting in 1954. Grave goods found include weapons such as swords, spearheads, and fragments of gold-plated armor and helmets, copper mirrors, and agricultural implements. The weapons in particular are considered to be rare examples nationwide, and have been preserved since 2010 at a private folk museum in Tsuruga. Mukaiyama site This site consists of three surviving kofun on a hilltop ridge in the Yoshikawa neighborhood of Tsuruga There is an explanatory plaque in front of each tumulus. *Mukaiyama No.1: A large burial mound from the end of the fifth century, diameter 60 meters, height 9 meters in two stages, faced with fukiishi stones. There is also a possibility that it was originally a scallop-shaped tumulus with a total length of 75 meter. There are two pit-type stone chambers at the top of the mound, and a large number of burial items have been excavated. However, the south side is partly missing due to construction work. *Mukaiyama No.2: This was a circular tumulus from the 5th century, possibility older than Mukaiyama No. 1. It was demolished during to the construction work of 1983. *Mukaiyama No.3: This is a circular tumulus from the second half of the sixth century, with a diameter of 15 meters, a height of 4 meters, with a lateral hole stone chamber (total length 7.2 meters, length of the entry room 3.7 meters, width of 2.0 meters, height 2.7 meters) . *Mukaiyama No.4: This is a circular tumulus from the second half of the sixth century, diameter 8 meters, height 2 meters, partially collapsed due to overgrowth of trees and plants.

At the time, the parachute was named, 'rescue apparatus for aeronauts' in 1910. The previous parachutes were not able to fit in a case like apparatus worn on the back, thus Paulus' invention became of paramount importance for the Germans in World War I and she produced about 7000 parachutes for the German forces. During World War I Paulus created approximately 125 parachutes a week. Paulus was also credited with inventing the drag 'chute, an intentional breakaway system where one small parachute opens to pull out the main parachute. Paulus was an avid aeronaut herself and logged over 510 balloon flights and over 165 parachute jumps in her lifetime. She was the first German to be a professional air pilot and the first German woman aerial acrobat. Despite the fact that hot air balloons are currently known as a sort of tourist attraction, during the final decades of the 19th century, these hot air balloons were at the time, were on the cutting edge of technology, and were popular before the invention of airplane.  Life  Paulus' was born in Zellhausen, today part of Mainhausen, near Frankfurt, Germany into a working class family. Her father worked as a day laborer and died when she was nineteen years old. After his death, Paulus picked up her mother's trade of seamstressing to help support the family. At 21, Paulus married Hermann Lattemann, a well-known balloonist, and began working as his assistant to repair the balloons with her skills as a seamstress. Paulus and Lattlmann begun to develop their professional and personal relationship, until Paulus began to parachute herself, and the two eventually got married. They had a son, Willy Hermann Paulus, who later died of diphtheria. In 1895, the couple were on a joint jump when Lattlemann's parachute failed to deploy. Paulus watched him fall to his death. While grieving the death of her husband, Paulus stayed in bed for months. That being said, during this time thousands of fans mailed letters of support to Paulus to request she continue her career of being a ballooner. Paulus then bought four new parachutes and set off on a tour of Europe using the stage name, Miss Polly. She performed theatrically, using acrobatic feats and even riding a bicycle suspending from a hot air balloon's basket. Paulus became an international success. Paulus completed her last balloon jump at age 63 (August 5, 1931).  Death  Paulus died at the age of 67 and is buried in a cemetery in Reinickendorf.  Honors  * in 2006, a street in Berlin was named after Paulus, titled, \\"The Katharina- Paulus-Stra√üe\\" it was formerly titled Lehrter station.

Likewise, they were all likely the apex predator of their habitats, comparable to the modern day killer whale (Orcinus orca), and achieved great lengths, with one species‚ÄìLivyatan‚Äìmeasuring about . The macroraptorial sperm whales‚ÄìAlbicetus, Acrophyseter, Brygmophyseter, Livyatan, Scaldicetus, and Zygophyseter‚Äìare an informal grouping of genera without a family designation. All species are known by at least a skull. Taxonomy Brygmophyseter skeleton The macroraptorial sperm whales are a paraphyletic fossil group of hyper-predatory stem sperm whales comprising four genera: Acrophyseter, Brygmophyseter, Livyatan, and Zygophyseter. These macroraptorials all share large, functional, enamel-coated teeth on both the upper and lower jaws, which were used in capturing large prey. In contrast, the modern sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) lacks enamel, teeth in the upper jaw, and the ability to use its teeth to catch prey. However, Livyatan belongs to a different lineage than the other macroraptorials, and the development of large size and the spermaceti organ, an organ that is characteristic of sperm whales, are thought to have evolved independently from the other macroraptorials. The large teeth either evolved once in the group with a basilosaurid-like common ancestor, or independently in Livyatan. The large temporal fossa depressions on the skull of raptorials is probably descended from a common ancestor (plesiomorphy). The presence of enamel is thought to be an ancient and basal characteristic, as it is present on the teeth of fetal modern sperm whales. Macroraptorials appeared during an adaptive radiation event of baleen whales in the Miocene, an increase in whale populations and diversity, implying the macroraptorials evolved specifically to exploit baleen whales. A tooth found in Australia indicates macroraptorials still existed 5 mya in the Pliocene. Zygophyseter was discovered in the Pietra Leccese Formation in Italy from a skull, teeth, and vertebrae; Brygmophyseter was discovered in the Bessho Formation in Japan from a nearly-complete skeleton; and Acrophyseter and Livyatan both originate from the Pisco Formation in Peru and are known by only a skull. Restoration of Zygophyseter It has also been suggested that the macroraptorials be placed into the subfamily Hoplocetinae, a subfamily characterized by robust and enamel-coated teeth, alongside the genera Diaphorocetus, Idiorophus, and Hoplocetus, which are known from the Miocene to the Early Pleistocene. However, most of these whales are known from fragmentary remains or have been used as wastebasket taxa for indiscernible stem sperm whale remains. Description Upper and lower tooth rows of Acrophyseter Macroraptorial sperm whales had large, functional, conical teeth in both jaws, as opposed to the modern sperm whale whose teeth are small and nonfunctional in the upper jaw. The teeth were deeply rooted into the gumline and could interlock, probably to aid in holding struggling prey. The teeth of Livyatan, at a length of , were one of the biggest teeth of any animal, excluding tusks. The macroraptorials also had well-developed muscles used in biting‚Äìthe temporalis and masseter. They also developed buccal exostoses in the mouth, bony growths which act as buttresses during biting, further increasing the bite force. Acrophyseter likely measured in life, Brygmophyseter , Livyatan , and Zygophyseter . The postcranial remains of only Zygophyseter and Brygmophyseter were found. The elongated lumbar vertebrae of Zygophyseter indicate it had larger multifidus and longissimus back muscles and was, thus, faster than the modern sperm whale which, comparable to other large open-ocean animals, travels horizontally at . A characteristic of sperm whales, the macroraptorials had a curved basin‚Äìthe supracranial basin‚Äìon the top of the skull. This encompassed the entire breadth if the snout in Livyatan and Brygmophyseter; Zygophyseter and Acrophyseter, instead, had reduced basins indicating beaks. Paleobiology niche as killer whales (Orcinus orca) Using their large and deeply rooted teeth, wide-opening jaws, and great size, they likely fed on a variety of sea life, including fish, cephalopods, seals, and small whales and dolphins, occupying a niche similar to the modern day killer whale (Orcinus orca). In fact, Zygophyseter is known colloquially as the \\"killer sperm whale\\" in reference to this. Likewise, they may have employed a similar hunting strategy of pursuing prey to tire it out before eventually drowning it. However, given their size, they probably did not need to hunt in groups. Livyatan probably targeted medium-sized whales ranging in size from . Macroraptorials probably competed with the extinct giant shark megalodon for the same food sources. In sperm whales, the supracranial basin holds the spermaceti organ, a series of oil and wax reservoirs which aids in echolocation. Speculatively, the organ may also serve a secondary function, such as vocalizing, acoustic stunning of prey, head-butting between males, ramming into prey, or buoyancy control by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the wax to change the density and weight.

The game was released worldwide on 20 June 2019. The game is developed by Eugen Systems and was published independently. Steel Division 2 is the sequel to the 2017 game Steel Division: Normandy 44. Gameplay Set during Operation Bagration, Steel Division 2 is a real-time strategy video game that takes influence from World War II, similarly to its predecessor, Steel Division: Normandy 44. The game is set to include single-player, multiplayer, and cooperative aspects. The single-player is dubbed \\"Dynamic Strategic Campaigns\\" and is turn-based (unlike the previous game), with each turn being the equivalent of half a day, though combat is done in real-time. The multiplayer allows for up to twenty players in ten against ten battles. Both modes feature twenty-five maps that are scaled 1:1 with a size of up to 150 √ó 100 kilometres, and cover the details of the battles that took place during the aforementioned operation. Able to play as both the Allied powers and Axis powers, players have the option of eighteen divisions and more with DLC, with the capability to choose from over six hundred units when building a deck. Decks are used during game, and only units in the deck can be deployed. Cooperative missions are also planned. Players who owned the first Steel Division game can have access to some 8 divisions (Both Axis and Allies) with over 350 units. The game supports mods. Development In early 2018, a strike of almost half of the developers at Eugen Systems took place, ceasing work until April, with no news on the subject being released until the announcement for Steel Division 2. The pronouncement was published July 25, 2018, alongside a trailer. It was declared that Paradox Interactive would not be publishing the game, despite their involvement with Steel Division: Normandy 44. Consequently, the game will be the first by Eugen Systems to be independently published. Alexis Le Dressay, the game director and company co- founder, said they listened to fan feedback from Steel Division: Normandy 44, and made relevant improvements. An updated game engine (the IrisZoom engine), redeveloped combat mechanics, and a new art style were noted as examples. A final release date of June 20, 2019 was announced following two prior delays.

At noon on 3 July 2018, the ship was deliberately grounded off the Selayar Islands. The ferry had reportedly suffered a leak on the port side of the lower deck. As the ferry began to sink, the captain decided to ground the ferry to stop the sinking and ease the rescue effort. The incident killed 35 people; 155 people survived the accident. The accident was the second major maritime disaster in Indonesia in less than a month, following the sinking of MV Sinar Bangun which killed 167 people on 18 June 2018. The sinking is the deadliest maritime disaster in South Sulawesi since 2015. National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia published their findings on 9 October 2018. The investigation found that numerous critical safety regulations were not followed by the crew. It also revealed that the sinking was caused by high waves that managed to enter the ferry. The ferry's low deck height caused waves to enter the lower decks, creating a free surface effect which ultimately led the ferry to list. The ferry's overdraft condition, absence of a freeing port on the main deck and untied vehicles on board aggravated the situation. Incident The ferry departed Bira Harbor at 10:00 a.m local time (UTC+8) en route to Pamatata Harbor, Selayar Islands, carrying 170 passengers, 20 crew members, 48 vehicles and a cargo of currency worth approximately 30 billion rupiah (roughly 2 million USD). Before the departure, officials in Bira Harbor had warned crews about the possibility of bad weather with high waves, with heights reaching 0.5‚Äì2 meters. The ferry was traveling at a speed of 8 knots and approximately 2 hours after its departure, the weather around the area deteriorated. Waves reaching 3 meters struck the port side of the ferry and managed to enter the main deck through openings in the hull. The ferry then started to list to the port side. A crew member was sent to investigate the situation and discovered that water had entered through the front ramp gate and hull openings. Passengers started to panic as the water level increased and some began to text relatives about the situation. At 13:00 local time, the Captain ordered the crew to use the pumps and scuppers to drain the water. However, 30 minutes later, the crew announced that all attempts to drain the water from the ferry was unsuccessful. The waves reached the upper deck and the ferry listed to an angle of 15 degrees to port. The Captain ordered the crew to begin evacuating the passengers. When the ship reached the waters near the island of Passilambena, the engines abruptly stopped. In response to the threat of a possible capsizing, the captain decided to change the ferry's heading and beached the ferry onto the seabed, to aid the rescue efforts. At 13:40 local time, the ferry contacted the seabed approximately 300 meters off Pabadilang Beach. Passengers were immediately told to don life-jackets. A video showed that the ferry was listing severely during the evacuation. Multiple people jumped into the sea and tried to swim to the shore, while others were thrown from their life-rafts due to the rough waves. Vehicles on board the ferry fell and were swept away. The Captain had sent a distress signal alerting local rescued authorities prior to grounding the ship. The Indonesian National Armed Forces, Indonesian Navy and the National Search and Rescue Agency were dispatched to the site. Makassar Naval Base dispatched KRI Madidihang-855 to the location of the incident. Local fishermen participated in the rescue effort. The rescue effort was hampered by bad weather. As news of the accident spread, dozens of survivors and onlookers posted videos of the accident and the evacuation on social media. Passengers and crews The passenger manifest retrieved by authorities indicated that there were 139 passengers and 48 vehicles on board MV Lestari Maju. However, rescuers reported that more than 150 passengers had been rescued from the ferry, indicating a possible data manipulation. The Public Relation of the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency stationed in Makassar reported that the ferry was carrying 164 passengers, 20 of them were unregistered. The NTSC, on its final report, finalized that, at the time of the sinking, there were 190 passengers and crews on board the ferry. Investigation Calculations by the National Transportation Safety Committee showed that the ferry, during its departure from Bulukumba, had a draft of 2,02 meters. The acceptable draft for a ferry prior to its departure is 1.75 meters, meaning that the ferry, at the time of the departure, was over weight. The National Transportation Safety Committee revealed that there were openings located on the starboard stern and port side stern of the ferry, one of which was only 0.7 meters above the waterline. Due to being over weight and the low height of the openings in the ship, waves reaching 3 meters could easily enter the ferry. Examination of the wreckage was carried out and revealed that there were only 4 scuppers on the main deck of the ferry and there was no freeing port. A scupper is meant to drain the water in small volumes, while a freeing port is used for larger volumes of water. Due to the limited amount of scuppers and the absence of a freeing port, the water on the deck wasn't able to drain quickly or effectively. The deck gradually began to collect a significant amount of water and a free surface effect occurred, causing the ferry to list to port. The untied vehicles located on the upper deck aggravated the listing. MV Lestari Maju after its salvage The investigation also revealed that the vessel involved in the sinking was actually a converted 10-tonne cargo vessel. During its modification process, the owner and surveyor of the vessel did not believe that a freeing port was necessary. The Ministry of Transportation should have prevented the vessel from being certified for passenger service. Further investigation revealed that the Ministry had instructed the vessel be modify to confirm with regulations but the dispatcher in Makassar deemed the vessel to be safe. Investigators discovered that the crew had never been trained on how to deal with an emergency situation. During the evacuation, many passengers panicked and immediately jumped into the sea without life jackets. The crew lacked the skills for crowd control and were unable to safely evacuate the passengers effectively. The competency certificate of the Captain and the crew was also deemed \\"unsatisfactory\\" by authorities. =Final report= The final report was published on 9 October 2018. It concluded that the sinking was caused by high waves that entered the ferry due to the low deck height and openings in the hull. The absence of a proper draining system caused the deck to quickly flood with water. The flooding then caused a free surface effect creating a list to its port side and the eventual capsizing of the vessel. The untied vehicles on board contributed further to the list. The Captain managed to prevent the vessel from completely rolling over and sinking by grounding, however, poor crew performance and bad weather led to loss of life.

It is regarded as one of Reynolds's most studied and well-known paintings, and is now in the collection of Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire.. Description The art historian Horace Walpole provided the earliest known description of David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy. Walpole also recorded that George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, bought the painting for ¬£300, though it is unclear if this ever actually occurred. David Garrick stands in the centre of the painting wearing an Anthony van Dyck costume, against a rural landscape with a field and woodland. He stands between the Muse of Comedy, known as Thalia, and the Muse of Tragedy, known as Melpomene. He appears conflicted and hesitates between them, starting to transform from a tragic playwright into a comedian. Tragedy grabs Garrick's wrist with one hand and raises her other hand. Comedy is framed by a field and sky as she pulls on Garrick's arm. The painting has motifs similar to 18th-century theatrical frontispieces depicting the Muses of Tragedy and Comedy: the Muse of Tragedy has a dagger and raises one arm, and the Muse of Comedy holds a mask in her left hand. The differences between the two Muses are both formal and iconographic. Comedy is painted in the rococo style, reminiscent of the work of Antonio da Correggio. Tragedy is drawn in the neoclassical style, after the style of Guido Reni. The painting employs elements of Augustan imagery, with its clothing, light, and shadow. Comedy has slightly tousled fair hair, resembling the bacchante drawn by Peter Paul Rubens. She wears washed-out mauve clothing. Tragedy wears a strong blue dress, with her head and arms covered as if in mourning. Comedy smiles at the viewer, while Tragedy looks sternly at Garrick. Comedy is in dappled light, while Tragedy is strongly lit from above, with a dark background. The side of Garrick's face towards Comedy is smiling and illuminated, while other side is in shadows as he looks worriedly at Tragedy. Art historians often compare the painting to a scene in Greek mythology in which the god Hercules has to choose between Virtue and Pleasure. Reynolds' painting parodied this scene in that, whereas Hercules ultimately chooses the more modestly dressed Virtue, Garrick starts to succumb to the more immodestly dressed muse of Comedy. It also differs from traditional compositions of this scene, which generally feature detached full-length figures. History =Background= David Garrick was famous as both a tragedian and comedian, and his earliest known association with the Muses of Tragedy and Comedy was in a 1747 poem by William Whitehead. In 1761, the same year Reynolds finished his painting of Garrick, a pamphlet with the signatures of the Muses of Comedy and Tragedy praised Garrick's theatrical achievements. The historian David Mannings has suggested that the painting's composition was inspired by Guido Reni's Lot and his Daughters Leaving Sodom. The painting follows instructions outlined in Notion of the Historical Draught of Hercules by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, which used the Choice of Hercules as an example of educational and moral art. The painting shows Reynolds moving away from strict portraiture, symbolized by Tragedy, to more witty iconography, symbolized by Comedy. =The painting and its prints= Mezzotint print by Edward Fisher Reynolds made this painting mainly in 1760‚Äì1761, around the same time he was working on a portrait of Laurence Sterne. Edward Edwards called it Reynolds's \\"first attempt in historical composition\\". The painting had a mixed reception when it was first published, with some arguing it showed Reynolds' painting skills, while others disagreed. Edward Fisher created a mezzotint for the painting in 1762 before he exhibited it in May 1762 at the Society of Artists in 1762 as Mr. Garrick, between two muses of tragedy and comedy. Fisher published his mezzotint in November 1762, having the inscription \\"Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique\\", meaning \\"he knows how to give to each what is appropriate\\". In 1764, Reynolds requested copies of this print to give to his admirers. The print was copied and pirated, producing at least fourteen different mezzotints. One of these prints, which was sold in France in 1765, had the inscription L'Homme entre le Vice et la Vertu. =Legacy= Distracted boyfriend meme inspired by a print of David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy Garrick's 1775 play The Theatrical Candidates alludes to the painting when the two main characters Tragedy and Comedy enter into a dispute, and the character Harlequin interjects and argues the audience prefers him over both of them. The painting possibly helped inspire Henry Fuseli's painting \\"The Infant Shakespeare between Tragedy and Comedy\\". The painting became one of Reynolds's most studied and well-known works. On 16 April 2018, a Twitter user called the painting \\"the 18th century equivalent\\" of the distracted boyfriend meme, an internet meme based on a stock photograph depicting a disloyal man and two women. The comparison went viral, and other social media users started using the painting as a meme similar to the distracted boyfriend meme.

The head of the family need to accept this. He finds it very difficult to acknowledge it which further disturbs him in executing his responsibilities. The show also portrayed the beautiful traditional costumes, the ancient locations in that region and the use of authentic north karnataka accent is the main highlight in this serial. Also, the show attempts to capture a fairly male centric setting of a Brahmin family. Cast * K. S. L.

The 'sixty milers' delivered coal to Sydney Harbour from ports and ocean jetties to the north and south of Sydney. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea from the Hunter River to Sydney. 479x479px  Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales  The coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales, involved the shipping of coal to Sydney‚Äîmainly for local consumption or for bunkering steamships‚Äîfrom ports of the northern and southern coal fields of New South Wales, Australia. It took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade that used larger vessels and continues today. Coal from the northern coalfields was loaded at Hexham on the Hunter River, Carrington (The Dyke and The Basin) near Newcastle, on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at Catherine Hill Bay. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of Morpeth, and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at Swansea Heads. Coal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at Wollongong Harbour and Port Kembla and at the ocean jetty ports: Bellambi; Coalcliff; Hicks Point at Austinmer; and Sandon Point, Bulli. Port Kembla was originally an ocean jetty port but two breakwaters were added later to provide shelter. Coal Wharf - AGL Gasworks at Mortlake on the Parramatta River with a 'sixty-miler' alongside (c.1900‚Äì1927) (Broadhurst, William Henry, 1855-1927, from collection of the State Library of NSW) At Sydney, coal wharves were located at the gasworks (Miller's Point, Mortlake, Neutral Bay, Waverton and Spring Cove at Manly). Coal was unloaded at the Ball's Head Coal Loader‚Äîfor steamship coal bunkering and in later years for exportInterpretive signage at Ball's Head Coal Loader‚Äîand at the coal depot at Blackwattle Bay. Before the Ball's Head Coal Loader opened in 1920, coal was manually loaded by 'coal lumpers' to steamship bunkers, from 'sixty-milers' standing alongside. Some industrial customers, such as CSR at Pyrmont, had their own facilities to unload coal Coal was also unloaded from time to time at the Government Pier (or 'Long Pier') at Botany on Botany Bay. 'Sixty-milers' sometimes also carried crushed basalt construction aggregate‚Äîor 'blue metal'‚Äîfrom the port at Kiama and the ocean jetty at Bass Point (Shellharbour) on the South Coast of New South Wales. The 'blue metal' was unloaded at Blackwattle Bay in Sydney Harbour. There was also a similar type of small bulk cargo ships, usually dedicated to carrying construction aggregate, known as the 'Stone Fleet'. Some 'Stone Fleet' ships carried coal from time to time.  The 'sixty-milers'  Although the earliest 'sixty-milers' were sailing vessels, the term was most typically applied to the small coal-fired steamers with reciprocating engines that were used during the late 19th and 20th Centuries. In the last years of the coastal coal trade, some 'sixty-milers' were diesel-powered motor vessels. = Design = The steam-powered 'sixty-milers' were relatively small vessels typically between 200 and 1500 gross tons‚Äîmost were under 1000 gross tons ‚Äîbut some were even lighter. The smallest of the 'sixty-milers'‚Äîships like the Novelty and Commonwealth‚Äîwere suitable to use the shallow Swansea Channel at the entrance to Lake Macquarie. In the earlier years some 'sixty-milers' were wooden ships, most were iron or steel vessels. Ships larger than the 'sixty- milers' were used for interstate and export coal carrying service. Some earlier vessels were paddle-steamers but most were screw steamers. The iron and steel vessels followed the British collier design of their day, and most were British-built. The typical 'sixty-miler' in the first half of the 20th- Century had a high bow but lower well deck where the hatches for the two holds were located. When laden, the ships had a low freeboard and relied upon the combings, hatch covers and tarpaulins over the hatches when the sea broke over the well deck. There was some variation in the design of the bridge and superstructure arrangements; the bridge could be either amidships or at the rear; the engine and fuel-coal bunkers could be amidships or toward the rear. Depending on the arrangement of the superstructure, the ships had either two of three masts. Some 'sixty-milers'‚Äîsuch as the Marjorie, Bellambi and Malachite‚Äîhad multiple gaffs on each of their masts, which were used when in port to suspend the planks used in manual coal bunkering operations. For most 'sixty-milers', ballast was provided by several water tanks located low inside the hull and running for most of the length of the vessel. Ships like the Undola that worked shallow ocean jetty ports, were designed with a shallow draft and self-trimming hatches, to minimise the chance of touching bottom during loading and to allow quick departures to be made. Some 'sixty-milers' in the 19th Century and early 20th Century were a type known as 'auxiliary steamers' that could raise triangular or trapezoidal sails on their masts. The Myola, could unfurl sails on her two tall masts and gain a knot or so of additional speed when the wind suited. = The ship owners and operators = This was a complicated matter; a vessel might be owned by one entity but chartered to another. The Hexham Bank may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter from its actual owners McIlwraith McEacharn of Melbourne, which itself owned and operated other similarly named 'sixty-milers' (Mortlake Bank, Pelton Bank and Hetton Bank). R.W. Miller not only chartered ships like the Hexham Bank but also owned its own ships such as the Birchgrove Park. The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most of these were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Some coal merchants, such as Jones Brothers' Coal, owned their own ships Ships of course were bought and sold, and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners.Sometimes, a change in ownership also resulted in a ship's name changing, such as when Corrimal was renamed Ayrfield or when South Bulli became Abersea. There were many owners up to the middle of 20th-Century, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. These complexities, together with the cross-ownership, mergers and takeovers that took place in the coal and coastal shipping companies, sometimes makes it hard to follow the owners and operators of particular vessels. = Operation and crewing = Due to the short distances between Sydney and the coal ports, and for commercial reasons, the 'sixty-milers' made frequent trips of short duration, carrying coal to Sydney and in ballast for the return trip. The coal cargo was stored in the holds in bulk and needed to be \\"trimmed\\" to ensure that its distribution did not result in a list to one side or the other. Typically, trimming was done by the ship's crew, although depending on the sophistication of the loading arrangements coal was loaded in such a way as to minimise the need for trimming. The ships could be loaded relatively quickly and be at sea in time to complete the trip to Sydney from Newcastle in six or so hours; it would take longer in bad weather. Operation of the 'sixty-milers' was typically six-days per week and around the clock. A crew of 10 to 16 was typical, depending upon the size of the ship. A crew of a 'sixty-miler' (1919) would include a master, two mates, two engineers, a donkeyman, two firemen, four to six seamen, a cook and a steward.  Incidents, losses and inquiries  Over the years of the coastal coal-carrying trade, many 'sixty-milers' were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. A common factor in most of the losses of 'sixty milers' was bad weather. In some losses, a factor seemed to be a haste to put to sea and get the cargo to Sydney. Another factor was the use of ocean jetties at some coal loading ports.Coalcliff Jetty - the smallest and most exposed of the ocean jetties (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, Powerhouse Museum) = Hazards of ocean jetties = The waters in which the ocean jetties were located were in nautical parlance called \\"open roadsteads\\", meaning \\"an area near the shore where vessels anchor with relatively little protection from the sea.\\" Ocean jetties typically were located so as to have some natural protection from the south, against the common \\"southerly buster\\". While somewhat protected from the south, all the ocean jetties were exposed to the \\"black nor'easter\\", a violent storm that can arise quickly. The rocky reefs that provided protection from one direction would themselves become a hazard,when the weather was from the opposite direction. The loading operation at an ocean jetty itself could be hazardous. In the days before moveable loaders, the ship needed to be repositioned under the fixed loading chutes, either to change hatches or to reduce the amount of trimming needed. All this, while in shallow water and close to a rocky shore or beach, made working the jetty ports hazardous.Jetty at Catherine Hill Bay, with a small 'sixty-miler' alongside. The reef is on the right. (NSW State Archives collection) Ocean jetty ports were more hazardous for sailing vessels than for the more manoeverable steamships. Yet, in the earlier years of the coastal trade, coal was mainly shipped on sailing vessels. The perils of these operations were shown by the events of the night of 7 September 1867, when two barques‚ÄîMatador and Bright Planet‚Äîwere blown ashore and wrecked at Bulli. On 7 June 1887, the 'sixty-miler' Waratah was halfway through loading a cargo of coal at the Hicks Point Jetty at Austinmer, when struck by a \\"southerly buster\\". Accounts of what happened next vary; she either dragged her anchor and broke her mooring rope or cast off quickly in an attempt to get away. A mooring rope fouled the ship's propeller, leaving her drifting helplessly. She drifted onto a reef of rocks that tore a hole in her. Attempts to tow her off, by the Illaroo, which had come from Bulli, failed. A heavy rope was rigged from the ship to the shore and a coal basket was used to bring the crew of fourteen and their belongings‚Äîone at a time‚Äîto safety. At low tide, the ship was high and dry on the rocks 300-yards to the north of the jetty. A total loss, she was later broken-up in situ for parts. Sublime Point Lookout (date unknown). Sandon Point, is the first headland, in the lower half of the photograph, with Bulli Jetty just visible. The long headland in the upper half is Bellambi Pont and its dangerous reef. On 1 June 1903, at Catherine Hill Bay, the only ocean jetty on the northern coalfield, the 'sixty-miler' Illaroo was driven ashore in a gale. Fortunately, she was refloated and survived. This was one of a number of incidents at this port, including the loss of a fully laden interstate collier, the Shamrock, earlier the same year. On 16 April 1914 the 'sixty-miler' Wallarah, while departing Catherine Hill Bay during a squally \\"east-nor-easter\\", was wrecked when heavy seas forced her onto the reef 70-yards to the south of the jetty. No lives were lost in these three incidents. Bellambi was a busy ocean jetty port with a dangerous reef. At least four 'sixty-milers' came to grief there. The 'sixty-milers' wrecked on the reef at Bellambi include Llewellyn (1882), Adinga (1896) and Saxonia (1898). In 1913, an occulting light visible for eight miles to sea was erected, on a steel tower on Bellambi Point, to guide ships away from the dangerous reef. In 1949, the 'sixty-miler' Munmorah, was the last ship to be wrecked there. The Court of Marine Inquiry into the loss of the Munmorah was not satisfied that the occulting light was on at the time of the stranding. Another difficulty of operations at ocean jetties was storm damage or collision damage to the jetty, which could close the port suddenly and keep it closed pending repairs. Loading at the ocean jetties needed to be fast to minimise the time that the 'sixty-miler' stood alongside the jetty. 'Sixty-milers' loading at ocean jetties needed to remain under steam and ready to depart at short notice should there be a change in the prevailing weather. 'Sixty-milers' sometimes departed without completing all the preparations that were prudent for the safety of ship and crew, There was also no inspection of any recently loaded ship at jetty ports. These were issues that would arise during the Royal Commission of 1919-1920. = Collisions and near misses = In 1896, the aging iron steamer, Merksworth, collided with the Pyrmont Bridge and was beached near the gasworks wharf at Millers Point. Later that same year, laden with coal from Catherine Hill Bay and bound for Millers Point, she collided with the ferry, Manly, and quickly started to sink. She was steered onto rocks west of the entrance to Mosman Bay, where her stern settled on the bottom in eight fathoms. She was refloated and repaired, returning to service and being involved in a third collision, with a smaller steamer, Mascotte, in Sydney, in 1897. Merksworth foundered, after being abandoned off Stockton Beach in May 1898, with only three survivors. In 1899, the 'sixty-miler' schooner May Byrnes was involved in a collision with the schooner Whangaroa in Sydney Harbour. The tug Champion had the two vessels and another schooner, Hannah Nicholson, in tow. Preparing to make headway under sail and lengthening her towline, May Byrnes was struck by Whangaroa. In June 1901, the 'sixty- miler' Herga collided with a schooner inside Sydney Harbour. The Kelloe sank, two miles off the Botany Bay heads in May 1902, after colliding with the 'Stone Fleet' coastal steamer Dunmore. The Dunmore picked up the Kelloe's crew and made it through the heads of Botany Bay, where she was only saved by being beached. In June 1903, the Currajong‚Äîa 'sixty miler' belonging to Bellambi Coal Co.‚Äîcollided with the Milsons Point ferry Victoria near Dawes Point. Later, in 1910, the Currajong collided again; this time with the steamer Wyreema off Bradley's Head, Sydney Harbour. One crewman died, when the Currajong sank in the main shipping channel. In August 1907, the J & A Brown 'sixty-miler' Alice collided with the North Coast steamer Wyoming in Johnstones Bay, Sydney Harbour. The Galava collided with a schooner being towed by a tug just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour in June 1920. Two 'sixty-milers', Wallsend and Meeinderry, collided off Red Head, in May 1922. The Meeinderry made it back to Newcastle but sank just inside the breakwater. In May 1925, Wallsend, while on the wrong side of the channel, collided with the steamer Coombar in Sydney Harbour. In October 1925, Wallsend collided, yet again, with another sixty-miler, Bealiba, at night, off Nobbys Head at the entrance to the Hunter River; both vessels were damaged but were able to return to port. In 1924, in an incident involving two 'sixty-milers' at The Basin, Belbowrie struck Audry D. amidship. Audrey D., in 1935, by then a lighter on Sydney Harbour, caught fire at her moorings in Snail Bay. In September 1926, the Stockrington headed up the Parramatta River toward Mortlake Gasworks and onto the course of a rowing race near Cabarita wharf. A catastrophe was narrowly averted when the first three scullers managed to pass just ahead of the ship's bow to complete their race. The same ship collided with the wooden piers protecting the structure of the Gladesville Bridge in January 1927. In May 1932, Abersea (formerly South Bulli), bound from Newcastle to Sydney carrying coal, collided with Tyalgum off Norah Head. Both were damaged but survived the encounter. A Court of Marine Inquiry found errors of judgement by officers of both ships contributed to the collision. In May 1935, the Birchgrove Park collided, with the Manly ferry Balgowlah, and was holed just above the water line. The ferry Balgowlah also collided with the small Lake Macquarie 'sixty-miler' Himatangi, two years later in August 1937, during a dense fog. The Munmorah collided, in December 1938, with the British cargo steamer Thistleford, which was anchored in Snail Bay. In June 1948, the Mortlake Bank, while leaving Sydney for Newcastle, ran into a fishing trawler, the St. Joseph's, near Sow and Pigs reef at night. The Glebe Island Bridge was the location of two collisions involving sixty-milers. In January 1949, the tug Emu was towing Abersea past the open bridge, when the tow rope snapped. Strong winds blew the tug against a guide pylon of the bridge, where she was struck in the stern area by Abersea. Emu raced for the CSR wharf at Pyrmont, where her crew scrambled to safety and the tug sank. Shortly after 9:30 a.m. on Friday, 29 September 1950, Hetton Bank collided with the bridge, damaging the bridge and disrupting road and tram traffic. = Shallow water = Groundings at low speed on a sandbank or mudbank usually‚Äîbut not always‚Äîhad no serious consequences‚Äîother than lost time and the cost of towing or refloating the vessel‚Äîbut were a hazard of working the Hunter River (Hexham in particular), Mortlake on the Parramatta River, and the other shallow water ports - Botany Pier and Lake Macquarie. Ships made use of the tides to avoid running aground in shallow Fern Bay, when laden with coal and heading downstream from the tidal Hunter River port of Hexham to the sea. The river needed dredging, particularly after major floods‚Äîlike those in 1949, August 1952 and February 1955‚Äîthat deposited large volumes of sediment. Even so, 'sixty-milers' occasionally ran aground on Hunter River mudbanks and needed to be towed off or refloated on a higher tide. Those running aground in the Hunter included, the Malachite in 1926, the Minmi in 1930, the Pelaw Main in 1931, 1946, 1948, and 1953, Pelton Bank in 1936 and 1939, the Hetton Bank in 1948 during a fog and in 1950, and in 1952 the Ayrfield, which went aground on a mudflat near Stockton after loading at the Dyke. Four 'sixty- milers' that serviced the Mortlake gasworks ran aground in the Parramatta River. In 1906 during a fog, the Duckenfield ran aground near Abbotsford. In 1930, the Pelaw Main coming from Hexham went aground near Cabarita‚Äîbut for the heavy fog she was within sight of her destination‚Äîwhen she anchored in shallow water and the tide then went out. The Hetton Bank ran aground near Cabarita in 1935 and again near Henley wharf in 1936 The Mortlake Bank ran aground at Huntley's Point‚Äîafter colliding with a moored yacht and demolishing a navigation beacon‚Äîin 1938. The Mortlake Bank came to rest with its side towering over nearby waterfront houses.The Euroka on Long Reef in 1913.Groundings in Lake Macquarie or its entrance resulted in two 'sixty milers' being lost, after the ships continued into the open sea. In 1913, the Euroka, a small iron paddle steamer, loaded coal at Belmont and then ran aground at Pelican Island‚Äîa small island in Lake Macquarie‚Äîand had to be unloaded to continue. The ship grounded again near the pilot station anchorage near Swansea but was not taking water. She continued her voyage out to sea on 19 October 1913 but started taking water. She was coping until south of Broken Bay, where her engine stopped due to the condensor being clogged with sand. She was abandoned off the northern beaches of Sydney, and she washed up on Long Reef before she could be salvaged. A leak caused by striking the bank of the Swansea Channel resulted in the wooden 'sixty-miler', Commonwealth, foundering off Terrigal in August 1916. As late as 1938, the Himitangi, ran aground on a sandbank inside the lake a quarter of a mile from the entrance, while departing for Sydney with a cargo of coal. Seven months before her demise at Bellambi, the Munmorah ran aground on a sandbank near the jetty at Catherine Hill Bay in 1948. Making use of her own winches and the high tide she was able to pull her way into deeper water. At the time that the Botany Pier (or 'Long Pier') on Botany Bay was in use, that part of the bay had sandbanks. The 'sixty-miler' Yuloo ran aground near there in 1914, after apparently missing the channel. The Bealiba, coming from Catherine Hill Bay, ran aground on a shoal in 1929. In 1919, the Audrey D also ran aground in Botany Bay. = Bad weather and heavy seas = The prevailing weather and sea conditions were a contributing factor in numerous losses and, in some cases, the main reason for the loss of lives and ships. In July 1877, the paddle steamer, Yarra Yarra, left Newcastle, with 500 tons of coal bound for Sydney. The weather deteriorated and she was forced to return to Newcastle early next morning. By then, the harbour was no longer safe; huge waves were breaking across the entire entrance. Near to the notorious Stockton Oyster Bank, just north of the river mouth, she appeared to lose steerage and turned broadside to the waves, after which a tremendous wave struck, carrying away the foremast. Yarra Yarra heeled over and sank by the stern. Her crew of eighteen all died. In January 1898, the brig, Minora, carrying coal from Newcastle to Sydney had foundered off Broken Bay, after unexpectedly shipping two large waves. The ship sank in less than five minutes, leaving no time to launch the boats. Nonetheless, all her crew of seven survived the sinking, by clinging to wreckage, but were not rescued by a passing steamer, Tangier, during the night, and subsequently all but one died. Her captain, William Gallant, was the sole survivor; he was in the water for nearly 24-hours before being rescued. Under the command of the same captain, the ship that replaced Minora on the Newcastle-Sydney run, the schooner May Byrnes, was caught by a sudden change of wind direction, while entering Port Jackson, and was wrecked on North Head, in February 1901; all her crew survived. In February 1898, another brig, Amy, carrying coal from Wollongong, was unable to beat away from the coastline during a ferocious gale. She went aground and was wrecked, on McCauleys Beach between Bulli Jetty and Thirroul. Although most of the crew appear to have survived the grounding, they could not be rescued and all those aboard her died. The same gale destroyed the Bellambi Coal Co.'s jetty. In 1896, Amy had survived going aground, at Cronulla, while carrying coal from Wollongong to Botany. = Off-course and aground = Going off-course at sea and grounding with little or no warning caused the loss of many 'sixty-milers' over the years of the coastal coal trade. The little ships set courses close to the coast but straying too close, usually unknowingly, put the ships at risk of striking dangerous reefs or running aground where the orientation of the coast changed. The Woniora‚Äîan 'auxiliary steamer' with three masts for sails‚Äîfound itself aground on Bondi Beach on the night of 8 June 1880. After jettisoning 100-tons of coal, she was towed off and was able to continue to port. (She later foundered off the entrance to Botany Bay, en route from Bulli to Sydney on 28 October 1882, with only one survivor.) Later in 1880, the Merksworth, outbound from Sydney, kept too close to the tip of South Head and struck the South Reef, a shelf of submerged rocks near the Hornby Light. Taking water, she was beached at Watson's Bay. In 1882, the Llewellyn, an 'auxiliary steamer' was on her way to Wollongong from Sydney but‚Äîunknowingly‚Äîsteaming too close to the coast, when it struck the reef at Bellambi. Her crew and the three passengers were saved but the vessel broke up and was a total loss. The first 'sixty-miler' called Duckenfield was en route from Newcastle to Sydney and steaming too close to the coast, when it struck Long Reef in 1889 and sank. In 1913, the Euroka, a small iron paddle steamer carrying coal from Lake Macquarie to Sydney, having been abandoned by her crew, washed up on Long Reef and was wrecked. In perfect weather, the Hilda went onto the rocks near the southern side of the entrance to Botany Bay on 19 July 1893. Her captain had left the helm in the hands of a seaman and gone below around 1 a.m., when the ship passed Cronulla. By the time that the captain returned, the ship was close to striking the rocks at the base of a sandstone cliff and he ordered her engines to be reversed. The Hilda struck the rocks but, under reverse power, came off the rocks almost immediately. She had been damaged and sank within two minutes after her crew abandoned the ship. The crew rowed to safety in Botany Bay and then walked to Sydney. On 24 March 1905, the Bellambi Coal Company's 'sixty-miler' Marjorie ran aground‚Äîat night and at high tide‚Äîon the reef known as \\"The Merries\\", at the north end of \\"Cronulla beach\\" - actually north of Wanda Beach on Bate Bay. Fishermen at the nearby locality of Boat Harbour were surprised to see a ship heading straight for the land but their attempts to alert the ship failed. The ship was stranded but not taking water; it could not free itself by putting its engine in reverse. By low water, it was possible to walk almost all the way around the vessel on the rocks. Fortunately, the sea was exceptionally calm and the ship sat on the rocks \\"as if in a dock\\". Four gangs of 'coal lumpers' were brought, by the 'sixty-miler' Bellambi, to manually jettison the cargo to lighten the ship for refloating. She was floated off but had some damage. On 24 February 1917, the wooden 'sixty-miler' Yambacoona was steaming toward Sydney within \\"200 to 300-feet\\" of Broken Head (at Terrigal, NSW)‚Äîan inquiry later found this far too close to land for safety‚Äîwhen the key came out of a pinion wheel in her steering gear. Her wheel could then spin freely with no effect on the helm. Although the captain put her engines into reverse, she ran hard against the rocks at the Skillion. The ship was holed and soon sank but the entire crew were able to get away in a boat. = Royal Commission of 1919‚Äì1920 = The six-month period from December 1918 to May 1919 saw the loss of three 'sixty-milers', the Tuggerah (owned by Wallarah Colliery), the Undola (owned by Coalcliff Collery), and the Myola (owned by Howard Smith Limited). There were survivors from the Tuggerah and Myola. The Undola had been lost with all hands, her fate unknown. In preceding years another three sixty- milers had been lost - the Wallarah (in 1914), the Commonwealth (in 1916), and the Yambacoona (in 1917). Pressure from the Seamen's Union and others led to the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry. The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal- carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah, sat for 29-days in 1919-1920 and called 123 witnesses. The Commissioners also inspected eighteen ships‚Äîincluding two under 80-tons‚Äîand the loading facilities at Catherine Hill Bay, Hexham, The Dyke (Newcastle), Bulli, Bellambi, Wollongong and Port Kembla. Evidence was given at the Royal Commission that 'sixty-milers' sometimes went to sea without properly trimming the coal first‚Äîresulting in a list to one side‚Äîand with the hatches off or not properly secured with tarpaulins. The Royal Commission found that both the Tuggerah and the Undola had departed, with all hatch covers off to allow the coal to be trimmed. In the case of the Tuggerah, at the time that the ship foundered, covers on one hatch were in place but had yet to be secured with tarpaulins and the other hatch was open to allow the coal to be trimmed. The ship had taken a sudden lurch to port‚Äîthe lee side‚Äîand a large sea came over the port rail, filling the well deck. This was followed by more seas in quick succession and the ship then turned over and sank. The Royal Commission's finding on the Tuggerah was that, \\"The cause of the sinking was undoubtedly water entering through open hatches.\\" The Royal Commission could not establish the cause of the loss of the Undola. It established that the ship was in seaworthy condition and stable. The nature of the flotsam washed ashore inclined the Royal Commission to the view that the ship had struck a German mine. The wrecks of the three ships were not found on the sea floor until many years later. When the wreck of the Undola was found, her hull largely was intact, showing that the Undola probably had foundered and not been sunk by a mine. From what remains of her wreck, it is not possible to know if the hatch covers were in place. Evidence was given that the Myola, had \\"free water\\" in her ballast tanks when she had left Newcastle. The Royal Commission found that this had played a critical role by making the ship unstable by reducing her righting levers. It was unable to explain the presence of this water‚Äîthe crew believed that the ballast tanks were empty‚Äîbut found it possible that the filling valves were not properly screwed down. Regarding the design of the ships, the Royal Commission found that the design was suitable. Relying upon calculations of a naval architect, the Royal Commission found that both the Undola and the Myola‚Äîif properly handled‚Äîwere stable. It did not have enough evidence available to find on the stability of the Tuggerah. The Royal Commission also noted that ships were only inspected prior to sailing at only three ports‚ÄîNewcastle, Lake Macquarie and Wollongong‚Äîand even not always at those ports. They also identified that there was no regulation preventing a ship from leaving port pending such an inspection. The Undola had sailed from Bellambi and the Tuggerah from Bulli, both ocean jetty ports at which inspections never took place. The inspection of the Myola had not prevented her sailing from Newcastle‚Äîdespite having a list when she left the wharf‚Äînor had it identified that the ship was overloaded (due to having some free-water in her ballast tanks), which had made her unstable. The Royal Commission found that the regulations against overloading‚Äînot submerging the load-line‚Äîwere not well promulgated or understood, and were being interpreted by some as not submerging the load-line on just one side of the ship. It found that there had been only two prosecutions for overloading in the previous five years. The Royal Commission made recommendations concerning the ships, the practices at ports and the legislation covering the coastal coal trade. = Later losses and near misses = Despite the Royal Commission, its findings and its various recommendations, losses of 'sixty-milers' and the lives of their crew members continued up to 1956. In 1924, the small wooden 'sixty-miler' Austral (157 tons), laden with coal, foundered off Barrenjoey Head. One life was lost. The survivors rowed for six-hours to reach the shore. Galava, in 1924, run aground at Cannae Point near the North Head Quarantine Station, while carrying coal bound for the nearby Manly Gasworks wharf; her crew managed to refloat her under her own power.Later, in 1927, en route from Catherine Hill Bay, she foundered off Terrigal, due to water entering the holds through hull plates in the bow; seven of her crew died. In April 1927, grave fears were held for the Stockrington, until she arrived in Sydney‚Äîher crew safe but in a state of exhaustion‚Äîafter having taken 40-hours to complete the trip from Newcastle during a violent gale. In 1928, the Malachite‚Äîa regular on the Sydney- Newcastle run that had been idle for about five months‚Äîwas sent to Blackwattle Bay for an overhaul. While berthed alongside the Howard Smith coal wharf, the ship suddenly heeled over and sank, settling on her side. She was refloated, but that was the end of her sea-going days. Also in 1928, the wooden collier Excelsior on a trip from Lake Macquarie sprang a leak. About four miles north of Sydney, the leaking became too much for the bilge pump to remove. She made it into Sydney Harbour and stayed afloat just long enough to be run aground in 12-feet of water at Parsley Bay in the suburb of Vaucluse. The R.W.Miller 'sixty-miler' Annie M. Miller sank on 8 February 1929, not long after entering service. She had loaded coal at Bulli with difficulty, needing to use ballast water balancing to correct a list to port. The Annie M. Miller's captain ordered the hatches to be put on before departure but not the tarpaulins. It appears that the forward hatches were not put on. The ship left the wharf some time after 2 pm in a moderate choppy sea. Twenty minutes after departure, the list to port returned. A check showed no water in the bilges. Passing Botany Bay, the list was then so bad that two feet of water was lapping number two hatch. Despite this, Captain Pilling continued towards Sydney rather than take shelter in the bay. The list got worse until the port railing was underwater. Captain Pilling ordered lifeboats to be prepared and the crew abandoned ship. The ship sank off Bondi. Six lost their lives. On 5 March 1929, a Court of Marine Inquiry found that the Annie M. Miller left Bulli with a decided list to port, caused by improper loading and that she was overloaded by 30 tons. The Inquiry also found that the Captain failed to place the tarpaulins on the hatches. The Inquiry stated that while it could not definitely come to a conclusion as to the direct cause of the sinking, its opinion was that the improper loading and the failure to place the tarpaulins led to the ship's loss. In June 1933, only two years after the loss of the Annie M. Miller , Bulli was also the last port of call of another R.W.Miller ship, the interstate collier Christina Fraser bound for Geelong. At the Marine Court of Inquiry into her loss, evidence was given that Captain Smith had admitted himself that he had on 'dozens of occasions' taken the Christina Fraser to sea with her hatches off and while coal was still being trimmed, apparently only doing so to save time. The owners contended that the hatches wereut on when the ship left Bulli. The ship had no radio. She was last seen off Gabo Island on 24 June 1933 during a gale, then‚Äîbut for same wreckage washed up at Lakes Entrance‚Äîthe Christina Fraser and her crew of seventeen men disappeared without trace. In 1934, Bealiba, on its way to Catherine Hill Bay from Sydney, ran onto rocks at Pelican Point to the south of the Norah Head lighthouse, in a fog. No lives were lost. In May 1936, the Abersea (formerly South Bulli), en-route from Sydney to Wollongong during a southerly gale, stranded on the Bellambi Reef, as a result of a navigation error by her second officer. She was only slightly damaged and was refloated. In March 1937, the small collier, Hall Caine, en route from Sydney to Lake Macquarie, sprang a leak near Broken Bay. She was taken in tow by another small ship, Idant, but she was taking on water too quickly and started to founder, causing her crew to abandon her. She sank off Terrigal. Her crew were rescued by Idant. The Minmi aground at Cape Banks and breaking up, in May 1937. (Samuel J. Hood Studio Collection, Australian National Maritime Museum) In May 1937 the large JABAS 'sixty-miler' Minmi ‚Äîalso used in the interstate coal trade‚Äîwas returning from Melbourne to Newcastle, when it ran onto the rocks of Cape Banks‚Äîthe northern headland of Botany Bay‚Äîat night, in heavy weather with visibility reduced by fog. The course set when passing Port Kembla should have taken her three miles off the cape, but an incoming tide and heavy weather on the starboard side possibly caused the ship to drift gradually inshore, while maintaining the notionally correct heading. Two of the crew of 26 died; one died of a heart attack soon after the ship ran onto the rocks and the other was lost in the heavy seas during the harrowing and dangerous rescue. In 1947, the small coastal steamer Paterson had just returned from wartime duty with the Navy and on her first trip carrying coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Sydney, when she had to be beached near Norah Head. She was refloated and reentered service but, in 1949, while carrying general cargo, the ship foundered near Norah Head, fortunately without loss of life. In 1949, the Munmorah, when arriving to load coal at the South Bulli Jetty at Bellambi, ran aground on the reef and broke up. No lives were lost. In 1951, one of the 'Stone Fleet' ships the Kiama, was carrying coal from Newcastle to Sydney, during a gale that carried her onto the Tuggerah Reef‚Äîlocated offshore due east of Toowoon Bay. The crew took to lifeboats and rafts but were too close to the reef to be picked up safely by the CSR ship the Fiona that was nearby. The Kiama broke up and sank within a few minutes. Only five of the thirteen crewmen survived by making it to shore. The ship built to replace the Annie M. Miller, her sister ship the Birchgrove Park, served from 1931 until she became the last 'sixty-miler' to founder in 1956. Only four of the fourteen crew of the Birchgrove Park survived. They told of how Captain Laurence Lynch had refused to seek the shelter of Broken Bay during a storm but had pressed on, toward Sydney, before the vessel foundered off the northern beaches of Sydney. The survivors also told how the pumps were not started until there was too much free water in the hold, leaking in from a damaged part of the aged ship. The survivors also told of how the ship's radio aerial was not in place, and they had to use their signal lamp to contact the South Head Lighthouse when the ship was in distress. This absence of radio contact and the search being made too far south of the ship's last location led to a greater loss of life than otherwise might have been the case. The loss of the Birchgrove Park forms a part of the narrative of a book‚Äî\\"The Sixty-Miler\\"‚Äîwritten by Norma Sim, the widow of Bill Sim, one men lost with the Birchgrove Park. One of the most modern of the 'sixty-milers', the MV Stephen Brown‚Äîbuilt in 1954‚Äînearly came to grief, when some air-vents that had been closed off and some of the deck hatches lost their covers in the stormy seas. She began to fill, with the water gradually entering her holds and developed a list. The hull sides at deck level began to go underwater, a circumstance very similar to that in the foundering of other 'sixty-milers'. The MV Stephen Brown made it through the heads into Sydney Harbour and Captain Don Turner initially proposed to beach her at Lady Jane Beach (Lady Bay Beach) just inside South Head. That proved unnecessary. Instead the ship stood off the beach pumping out some of the water. She was then able to discharge her cargo at the CSR wharf at Pyrmont as intended. The MV Stephen Brown was probably saved only by her great stability. Her ventilators and hatches were modified to decrease the risk of a reoccurrence. Hexham Bank had survived her time carrying coal as a 'sixty-miler' but, in June 1978, while preparing to load construction aggregate (\\"blue metal\\") at Bass Point, she caught fire. All her crew were rescued. Her engine room was destroyed and the ship was deemed a \\"constructive loss\\" and scrapped. Her hulk later was later sunk off Sydney Heads.  Decline and end of the 'sixty-milers'  The heyday of the 'sixty- milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. During this time Sydney was dependent upon the ships. In 1919, the Royal Commission identified twenty-nine colliers engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade. As demand for coal in Sydney fell, the coastal coal trade of New South Wales declined. 31 December 1971 was a critical turning point; the huge Mortlake gasworks ceased making town gas from coal. Petroleum replaced coal as a feedstock for town gas- making, and oil refinery gas was purchased to supplement supply, during the interval until Sydney's gas was converted to natural gas in December 1976. After 1972, there was only one of the three loaders at Hexham operating; it closed in 1988, and the coal unloader and depot at Blackwattle Bay also closed. The few remaining 'sixty-milers' mainly carried coal for export to the reopened Ball's Head Coal Loader, until it too closed for a second and last time in 1993, marking the end of the coal trade to Sydney.Interpretative signage at the Ball's Head Coal Loader The last 'sixty-miler' to unload at Ball's Head was the MV Camira ; she was also last 'sixty-miler' to be built, in 1980. MV Camira was sold in 1993 and converted to a livestock carrier. During the 1980s the development of Newcastle as a bulk coal export port resulted in a revival of coastal coal shipping, this time to Newcastle. Purpose built in 1986, a new self-discharging collier the Wallarah‚Äî the fourth collier so named and, at 5,717 gross tonnage, far larger than any older 'sixty-miler'‚Äîcarried coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle, where it was unloaded for export at the Port Waratah Coal Loader at Carrington. This last echo of the coastal coal-carrying trade ended on 22 July 2002.  Surviving 'sixty-milers' and wrecks  MV Stephen Brown at AMC - 1987 The last of the 'sixty-milers' afloat is the MV Stephen Brown, built in 1954 in Aberdeen Scotland. She ran between Hexham or Catherine Hill Bay and Sydney, and was donated in April 1983 to the Australian Maritime College. She is now permanently moored at Beauty Point on the Tamar River in Tasmania and used as a stationary training vessel.The \\"Forest Ship\\", the \\"sixty-miler\\" Ayrfield, with the remains of the Mortlake Bank behind it Now better known as the \\"forest ship\\", the rusting hulk of the 'sixty-miler' Ayrfield (built in 1911 and originally named Corrimal) rests in shallow water in Homebush Bay on the Parramatta River, which at one time was used as a breaker's yard. The Ayrfield survived service as a transport ship in WWII and was later a regular on the run between Newcastle and Blackwattle Bay, She now hosts a luxuriant growth of mangrove trees and is a minor tourist attraction. Also in Homebush Bay is the partially disassembled hulk of another 'sixty-miler' the Mortlake Bank (built 1924). Both have been there since 1972, The Mortlake Bank rests upstream of the former site of AGL's gasworks at Mortlake, to which she carried coal from Hexham for many years. The rusted boiler of the 'sixty-miler' Munmorah is still visible at low tide on the reef at Bellambi. Part of the stern of the Minmi lies exposed on rocks on the inside of Cape Banks, at the entrance to Botany Bay, having moved since she stuck the rocks on the outside of the cape in 1937. The seabed in the small cove inside Cape Banks, Cruwee Cove, is littered with girders and plates from her wreckage. There is a memorial to the brig, Amy, erected in 1898, near where she was wrecked and her crew perished, at Thirroul. The Currajong remains, where she sank, after a collision in 1910, at the bottom of the main shipping channel of Sydney Harbour for incoming ships, just off Bradley's Head. The wrecks of the 'sixty-milers' Duckenfield, Woniora, Kelloe, Hilda, Undola, Tuggerah, Myola, Annie M. Miller and Birchgrove Park lie on the sea-floor near Sydney, Galava lies off Terrigal, and Yarra Yarra just north of the mouth of the Hunter River. All continue to attract adventurous divers.

In the 1990s there were 98 in Quebec, 58 in New Brunswick, and one in Ontario, the West Montrose Covered Bridge. Between 1969 and 2015, the number of surviving covered bridges in Canada dropped from about 400 to under 200. = United States = At least two covered bridges make the claim of being the first built in the United States. Town records for Swanzey, New Hampshire, indicate their Carleton Bridge was built in 1789, but this remains unverified. Philadelphia, however, claims a bridge built in the early 1800s on 30th Street and over the Schuylkill River was the first, noting that investors wanted it covered to extend its life. Beginning around 1820, new designs were developed, such as the Burr, Lattice, and Brown trusses. According to Covered Bridges Today by Brenda Krekler, as many as 12,000 covered bridges once existed in the United States; that number dropped to under 1,500 by the 1950s. The National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges was formed in 1950.

Some off-shoots of the parent mountain range go as far North as Nauti-Chhatoli-Nandasain in Chamoli, Paithani (Pauri Garhwal) in the West and Mehalchauri/Milchori (Chamoli) in South-East. Musa-ka-kotha, the highest peak in Dudhatoli range, is higher than Nag Tibba (often wrongly quoted as the highest peak in the Shivaliks) by almost hundred metres. The core area of Dudhatoli mountains, known as Dudhatoli Danda has an average elevation of 2900 to 3000 metres (9500 to 10000 feet). Dudhatoli range, Central Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India Etymology The word Dudhatoli is a composite word in Garhwali language made up of \\"Doodh-ki-tauli\\" which translates to \\"Cauldron of Milk\\" in English. As long as recorded history goes Dudhatoli meadows have been used as a grazing ground for cattle, sheep and goats for hundreds of years. It is the thick, luscious and juicy grass of these giant rolling mountains that produces plenty of good quality milk. The cattle-herders and shepherds further go on to produce tonnes of butter and ghee in dozens of temporary shelters spread across these pastures. There used to be a time when up to 50000 cows and buffaloes were kept in makeshift barns (known as Khark or Chhaanni in Garhwali) scattered all over these desolate mountains. Today, at the onset of summer season, these animal-herders can still be seen making their annual journey up the mountain with their bag and baggage tied at their backs. They get down to their (other) homes at the onset of winter season when grass starts drying up in autumn. Dudhatoli mountains as seen from Kalinka temple near Garhwal-Kumaon border, Pauri district. History, Geography, Flora and Fauna Known as Pamir of Uttarakhand, Dudhatoli has gently rolling mountains and expansive meadows that lie at the geographical centre of Uttarakhand state. In ancient and medieval times, the entire Garhwal kingdom was divided into different Pattis and Parganas for ease of administration; chieftains of various clans used to hold them in the name of the king of Garhwal. Kings have long gone, but the system of Patti (pronounced as p…ôt-ti:) and ParganƒÅ is still alive. Today while writing their addresses, people of rural Uttarakhand write their Names, Village, Post office, Patti/Pargana, Block/Tehsil, District and lastly state with zip code. It is interesting to know how two different pattis can have two different versions of Garhwali language. About 60 percent of Dudhatoli region comes in Pauri Garhwal district (the Pattis of Chauthaan, Choprakot and Dhaijyuli), whereas the remaining portion (40%) forms a part of Chamoli Garhwal (pattis of Chaandpur and Lohbha). Higher elevated regions of these five pattis constitute Dudhatoli range. The north-western spur of Dudhatoli range joins the ridge of Hariyali Kantha temple above Jasoli Village in Rudraprayag and Dobri Village in Pauri Garhwal. Dudhatoli and its surrounding foothills form an intricate network of riparian zones and is home to one of the densest as well as largest temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests in the state. West Himalayan Fir (Abies pindrow), Spruce, Deodar (Cedrus deodara), Pine, Maple, Chestnut, Hornbeam, Alder, Hazelnut etc. are the common trees here. Besides this, many medicinal herbs, shrubs and wild fruits are found here, of which Wild Oregano, Thyme, Galangal, Berberis, Raspberry, Gooseberry, Rose hip, Himalayan Strawberry tree (Bentham's Cornel/Cornus capitata), Redcurrant and Blackcurrant are to be noted. Dudhatoli mountains are source of many non-glacial perennial rivers; Nayaar- East, Nayaar-West (merging with each other at Satpuli) and Ramganga (West) being the major ones, not to mention the innumerable water springs and streams that drain into these rivers (Names of all significant rivers with their headwaters in Dudhatoli have been given in the infobox above). This region is a wonderland of untouched virgin beauty and has a huge potential to be developed as a tourist attraction. Ecological significance Dudhatoli's ecological importance can be understood from the fact that it is the source of dozens of streams and 5 perennial non-glacial rivers. The locals and shepherds have been using the medicinal plants found here, for hundreds of years. While nomads and shepherds are only temporary residents here during warm and rainy months, it is still permanently inhabited by many wild animals such as Leopard, Jungle Cats, Bear, Wild Boar, Porcupine, Wild Antelope-goat (Ghoral), Hare (Wild Rabbit) along with dozens of bird species of which pheasants being the most prominent. As higher elevations of these mountains are snow-clad till late March, the melting snows gently seep into the soil and recharge the water table. By June, rains come in, making the rivers and streams perennial. The moisture keeps the forest and meadows evergreen. However, due to reckless exploitation of forests and natural resources in the 1970s, this region has suffered a lot and is still recovering and rejuvenating its depleted forests and denuded ridges. This creates an illusion, as some of the treeless ridges seem to be above tree-line. But in reality, the highest ridges are close to 500 metres (approximately 1500 feet) below tree-line. Another reason for the declining forest cover is that the seeds of trees are propagated downwards by the action of wind and gravity, unableto sustain the forest stretches on the upper slopes, resultingly the trees on higher elevations gradually die.

However, it gets bitter cold in winter with subzero temperatures not uncommon, as is typical of all the middle-Himalayan mountains and meadows. It receives heavy snowfall in the months of December to March and is the first place to get snow in the district. Sometimes, snow can be seen in cold and shadowy spots till late March or early April.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/30465/6/chapter%203.pdf How to Reach Dudhatoli can be approached from Thalisain in Pauri Garhwal (NH 121) and Gairsain (NH 87) in Chamoli Garhwal. While coming from Thalisain side, people get down at Peethsain (22 kilometres from Thalisain) and reach Dudhatoli after a trek of about 24 kilometres. The other route is much shorter albeit steeper, which goes from Gairsain to Bharadisain (the site of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha) and then 10 to 12 kilometres of steep trekking.

It is also known as Headworks; Industrial Archaeological Site. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  =Colonial history= As early as 1817 retired army officer Lieutenant Samuel North was granted south of Parramatta and south of today's suburb of Guildford. He named his property Guildford in honour of the Earl of Guildford. An area of west of Woodville Road was reserved by Governor Phillip and then passed to the Church and Schools Corporation. John Thomas Campbell, administrative assistant to Governor Macquarie in 1823 also received a grant of of land. Campbell's land which he called \\"Quid pro Quo\\", lay west of Woodford Road and south of Rawson Road. William and John Lackey also received grants in the area in 1838. Their property was known as Woodville. Then in 1843 Henry Whitaker purchased North's Guildford property along with several neighbouring properties and called his land Orchardleigh. The Quid pro Quo estate was subdivided for sale into four blocks in 1832. Additional subdivisions occurred in the 1860s and 1870s with land being purchased by Holroyd and Sherwin. Phillip's reserved area was subdivided in 1871. By 1870 a small settlement had developed with a school at William and John Lackey's Woodville and by 1880 a church had been erected. In 1876 a railway station opened to the north, west of Woodville Road and at the west end of today's Guildford Road. As a new settlement began to develop around the railway station, the earlier settlement became known as \\"Old Guildford\\". Near the railway station the land of Stimson was subdivided in 1876 and 1884 and the new settlement of Guildford emerged. It was not until 1913 that Guildford began to grow into a busy town. A brickworks established in 1915 and the subsequent building industry contributed to its growth. New shops and houses were built for the increasing population. While the building boom lasted into the 1920s, a 1928 aerial photograph shows that much of the surrounding region was still undeveloped. =The Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme= A Commission was appointed in 1867 to resolve the problem of water shortages which had been exacerbated by the region's increasing population and periods of drought. The Commission recommended implementation of the Upper Nepean Scheme. After years of debate, this particular scheme was sanctioned by the English civil engineer W. Clark, who had been employed by the government to assess the various options. According to this scheme, water would be directed from the Nepean River and its tributaries (the Avon, Cataract and Cordeaux) through a system of tunnels, canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal, down to Prospect Reservoir and from there through the Lower Canal to the Pipehead Basin. The Pipehead Basin was the junction at which the Lower Canal joined the pipeline that would convey water to the screening facility at Potts Hill Reservoir and from there to the Crown Street Reservoir and reservoirs at Woollahra, Paddington and Waverley. =Pipehead's construction= The NSW Public Works Department began contracting work on construction of the Upper Nepean Scheme in 1880. The following year the government purchased the narrow strip of land for the Pipehead Site from the area's major estates, land probably used for grazing and timber. According to technical documents from 1884, the Pipehead Basin was to be a \\"simple reservoir built of brick with a mass concrete floor, on a roughly square plan with rounded corners\\". It would have a strainer which spanned its width supported by the reservoir walls and 5 pylons and included a wrought iron grating to prevent course matter from reaching the water supply mains. In 1888 the first water supply main from Pipehead to the Potts Hill Site became operational. This 72\\" pipe, known as Main No. 1, was constructed of \\"wrought iron riveted pipes, connected with steel collars with lead joints\\". In the same year the Pipehead Site was fenced and work commenced on the Pipehead Basin (which was completed in 1893). According to a c.1888 plan, the Pipehead Site consisted of the Basin, the canal and pipework and the perimeter fence with its 3 gates. There were no buildings on the plan: no residences, offices or other structures. Increasing demands on the water supply and efforts to upgrade sections of the mains in other areas led to the establishment of a second water supply main from Pipehead to Potts Hill. Main No.2 was constructed from 'mild steel pipes with angle iron flanged joints, and coated internally with asphaltum. It became operational in 1900. A water main for direct supply to Ryde was completed in 1909. For the first time, this allowed water to bypass the Potts Hill screening chamber. It would be screened instead in a single chamber that had been added to the Pipehead Basin in c.1903-5. A Venturi Meter was added to the Ryde main in c.1906 and a small valve house was constructed above it. From 1902-12 the Lower Canal was relined and the level of water was raised by 1.5m, increasing the canal's capacity by approximately 75%. The Potts Hill screening chamber found difficulty coping with the increased supply of water and it became a \\"major hold up point in the water supply network\\". In order to resolve this problem a new screening facility was built at the Pipehead Site - with 3 Pipehead Basins completed in 1913, 1918 and 1928/9. The Potts Hill screening station was then dismantled. Cranes were introduced to operate the screening at Pipehead. These included the earliest crane (a transversing jib crane with an oil motor) possibly dating to 1909, a new travelling crane which was in operation by 1915 and a locomotive crane which was installed in 1916. After electricity powered the site in 1917 these cranes were converted to electric power and by 1922 there were 4 cranes in operation on the site. A third water supply main from Pipehead to Potts Hill, Main No. 3, was completed in 1925. It was constructed from electrically welded steel pipes with collars and \\"full-run\\" lead joints. However the Pipehead to Potts Hill mains were considered so silted that, in 1926, they had to be relined. Supply was again being amplified to meet consumer demand and a new temporary woodstave main was proposed. The preference for woodstave over steel was intended to avoid the delays anticipated by the need to obtain pipes. This new main was completed by the end of 1927. With supply still being amplified in 1929 the Chief Engineer proposed construction of a 72\\" water supply main between the Upper Canal and Pipehead. Work began on the new main in 1931 but the Depression interrupted the project. Work resumed in 1933 under a special unemployment relief programme and the main was completed by 1937. The temporary woodstave main ceased to operate in 1938 and was gradually dismantled and/or filled with sand from 1939-41. =Expansion of the site= A parcel of land (4 acres, 2 rods and 31.75perches) between the Pipehead Site and Parkes & Palmer Streets was purchased in 1906 as an addition to the site. There was a cottage on this land, situated about west-northwest of the Basin. At the same time the section of Sydney Street which divided this land from the Pipehead Site was also acquired. Around 1910 a detailed survey was undertaken of the Pipehead Site. This showed the site had two cottages. The first was originally built for the caretaker probably s as a \\"typical unpretentious working class residence\\" with four rooms, timber cladding and a bull-nosed verandah. By 1910 there were plans to convert this into an office. The second cottage was purchased in 1906 with the Sydney Street property. This had been built as a private residence with brick foundations, pine weatherboard cladding, corrugated galvanised iron, brick fireplaces and a four panelled pine entrance door. This was evident in aerial photographs of 1928, 1951 and 1961. It was removed some time in the 1960s and the area on which it stood was cleared by bulldozers to make way for a stores and workshop area. The detailed survey plan of 1910 also indicated the footprint of a third cottage or \\"new residence\\" (facing Parkes Street to the south of the Basin). The plan also showed the site held a 'machine shop, carpenter's store, general workshop/store' (built 1905). There was a \\"boosting plant\\" with a second boosting plant in the planning. An elevated tank of was proposed for construction, to be used in conjunction with the two boosting plants. This tank was installed in 1913. Work began on the new or third cottage in 1911 and was completed by 1913. Documents for this show a \\"spacious house plan, characteristic for upper middle class residences in outer suburbs of the time\\". The plan featured three bedrooms, an office, large board and dining room, sitting room, two verandahs and an amenities wing. A 1915 survey plan of the Pipehead Site showed the elevated tank and original cottage (situated to the north of the screening basin) had, by this time, been demolished. Sydney Water's 2005 conservation management plan suggests that the original cottage footprint is \\"still identifiable in its original location\\". The Pipehead Site was again expanded in 1928-9 with acquisition of four land allotments () between Albert, Bowden and Frank Streets. This had previously been owned by orchardists Daniel and Edwin Wakeley. At the same time, part of Frank Street which separated these two purchases from the original Pipehead Site was also acquired and still more land was purchased in 1949. The Carpenter's Store in the 1910 survey plan and 1928 aerial photograph was no longer shown in a 1951 aerial photograph. Sherwood Pumping House in the 1928 aerial photo had been removed by 1951 and replaced with new structures which housed Boosting Plants. The 1951 aerial photo shows addition of several auxiliary structures near the 1906 cottage and a large new building with a hipped roof east of the Canal. In the 1950s there were 2 new structures built: a large rectangular building in the north-west portion of the site (between the Canal and Palmer Street) and a smaller rectangular building adjacent the Boosting Plants. Also a new 84\\" steel pipeline was completed from Prospect to Pipehead in 1958. Aerial photographs show a number of changes made to the site between 1961 and 1970. The boosting stations north of the Basin were removed as was the 1905 workshop building. This was replaced by a Water Pumping Booster c.1967. The second cottage (bought in 1906) and large rectangular 1950s building were demolished and the northwest portion of the site completely cleared. New buildings in this area included the Old Store Building, Storage Shed, Asset Management Workshop and Storage Building. The pre-1950s building with the hipped roof to the east of the Canal was replaced with the present Main Building and Conference Room 3 in c.1967. A residence was built for the Resident Site Operator and so were a Pipeline Control Room, Geological Office and Laboratory and several smaller structures. In the years 1970-8 a Geological Sample Storage Shed and Water Pumping Station No. 189 were built and two of the main screen basins were replaced by a set of 4 rotary drum screens. Supply from Pipehead to Potts Hill was enhanced by the construction of an additional supply tunnel in 1972. A second Geological Sample Storage Shed and \\"Hellodrome\\" were built between 1978‚Äì86 and No. 1 and No. 2 screening decks were enclosed by a steel shed in 1981. In 1991 the Board decided to move screening operations from Pipehead to Prospect and in 1995 staff were relocated and the screening area was decommissioned. After the screening decks officially closed in July 1995 the site was used only for administrative offices. In 2005 water was still piped from Prospect to Pipehead and from Pipehead to Ryde, Potts Hill and Holroyd. Sydney Water Corporation's 2005 conservation management plan says the elements to and from the Pipehead Site and the Screening Chambers completed in 1929 \\"are generally in their configuration as at the time of construction\\". The now empty Lower Canal is also largely unaltered. Other historic elements such as the woodstave main, boosting and pumping stations and the pre-1913 screening facilities are no longer identifiable in the landscape.Stedinger & Associates, 2008, 9-14 Pipehead has been the operational \\"headworks\\" since 1888 for the Upper Nepean Scheme, Sydney's first reliable water supply. The scheme was the first of its kind in NSW, harvesting water in the Southern Highlands and transporting it via canals, aqueducts and pipelines. The storage was initially only at Prospect, but later major storages were added at Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean. The Pipe Head to Potts Hill Water Supply consists of three pipelines built between 1888 and 1925. In particular, Pipeline No.1 commissioned in 1888 was the first link between Pipehead (at Guildford) and the Potts Hill No. 1 Reservoir, the scheme's major service reservoir. The pipelines display state-of-the-art technology of the time in Australia. Also, the pipelines illustrate the advancements in major pipeline construction over a span of some 37 years. Four stages of land purchases to the current site started with an initial resumption in 1881, purchase in 1906, gradual purchases in 1928-9 and a further resumption in 1949. Now the pipelines have not become obsolete, but by virtue of boosters, are still key components of Sydney's water supply system. It was the changeover from open canal to No. 1 pipeline that gave Pipehead its name. The site is now arguably the most important operations and control centre for Sydney's water supply system.Sydney Water, 2005  Description  The pipehead forms part of the Upper Nepean Scheme. The following significant items are listed in the Upper Nepean Scheme Heritage Study, 1992 and are the only items on the site considered to be included in this listing: # Pipe Head Deck (Basin and Screening Chambers), Screening Chamber # Screening Chamber No.2, Screening Chamber # Travelling Jib Cranes, Cranes # 72 inch mains, Pipe Head to Potts Hill, Mains Pipe # Former Residence, now Environment Team office, Residence # Former Ryde Valve House, Valve House # Supervisory Control Centre, Headworks, Control Room (now refurbished as an Incident Management Centre and not of heritage significance). ;Lower Canal The following significant items are listed in the Upper Nepean Scheme Heritage Study, 1992. 51, Canal Overbridge, Canal Overbridge, 18. ;Additional heritage items include: WPS 22. Guildford, pumping to Holroyd Reservoir). WPS 42. Pipe Head. WPS 189. Pipe Head - Ryde. ;Pipehead The Pipehead Complex is situated off Frank Street, Guildford, at the termination of the Lower Canal from Prospect Reservoir, at from the commencement of the Upper Nepean Scheme. The Pipehead Complex is the Headquarters for the Water Board's former Headworks organisation for the supply of bulk water to Sydney and includes a wide range of buildings and ancillary structures to facilitate this purpose. These include steel sheds for equipment storage and maintenance, the Holroyd Pumping Station, outlets for the Ryde Pumping Station suction mains and Booster Station, a booster station for supply to Potts Hill, other ancillary plant, recent offices and administration buildings, and the former main supervisory control centre for the \\"Headworks\\" water supply system. A former residence is now in use as the Catchment Control and Management Office. The complex also retains several items, which specifically relate to the supply of water to Sydney under the original Upper Nepean Scheme. Most notable amongst these is the Pipe Head Deck, comprising the basin and screening chambers, located at the end of the Lower Canal. Although two of the screening chambers (the two on the north, Nos. 1 and 3) have been modified, the No. 2 chamber on the south side was \\"retained for emergency stand-by\\" and remains essentially in its original configuration with timber-framed plate screens, which are lifted by two travelling jib-cranes. On the east side of the Pipe Head Deck is the commencement of the three mains,Nos. 1, 2 and 3 which convey water from Pipe Head to Potts Hill. Pipe Head initially only formed the junction (basin) between the open canal or Lower Canal and the original pipeline, with screening being carried out at Potts Hill. The first screening chamber at Pipe Head was completed in 1913. On the west side of the Lower Canal, just before it enters the basin is a concrete lined inlet, entering at an oblique angle. This was formerly the inlet for the woodstave pipeline, constructed in 1927 to amplify the supply between the Upper Canal, Pipe Head and Potts Hill. (This was part of the line from Prospect to Potts Hill with a offtake to Pipe Head). A section of this woodstave pipe and an associated butterfly valve were displayed at the Pipe Head Complex for many years, but have now been relocated to Prospect Reservoir. There is also a steel \\"trash rack\\" and stop-board grooves across the Canal at the entry to the Pipe Head Basin, which are typical of the remnant evidence throughout the Upper Nepean Scheme of past uses and operational terchnology. The Upper main from the Upper Canal, constructed in 1937, passes to the south of the Pipe Head Deck and has a cross-connection to the No. 3, main to Potts Hill, just east of the Pipe Head Deck. Near the north-east corner of the Deck stands the picturesque, former Ryde Valve House constructed in 1917. A \\"Venturi\\" flow meter from this valve house is on display inside the main administration building. Other major water supply structures at Pipe Head include the pipeline from Prospect Reservoir, constructed between 1954 and 1958. This formerly entered the Deck, but now passes under the Lower Canal to join the main to Potts Hill, which runs in a tunnel, completed in 1972. Additional structures include various (recent) valve installations, sub-stations etc.  Heritage listing  As at 8 December 2005, Pipehead is an integral part of the Upper Nepean Scheme and for many years acted as the operational \\"Headworks\\" for the Upper Nepean Scheme as a whole. The significance attached to these pipelines stems from their association as an integral element with the Upper Nepean Scheme, Sydney's first reliable water supply. The scheme was the first of its kind in NSW. It involved the harvesting of water in the Southern Highlands and major transportation to Sydney via canals, aqueducts and pipelines. The storage was initially only at Prospect Reservoir, but years later major storages were added at Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean. There had been a similar scheme in Yan Yean outside Melbourne in 1856, as well as others at Bendigo and Ballarat. The scheme was the first of its kind in Australia and involved the harvesting of water in the southern highlands, storage thereof and then major transport to Sydney via canals, aqueducts and pipelines. The Pipe Head to Potts Hill Water Supply consists of three pipelines built between 1888 and 1925. In particular, Pipeline No.1 commissioned in 1888 is especially significant, as this was the first link between Pipehead (at Guildford) and the Potts Hill No.1 Reservoir, the scheme's major service reservoir for the gravitational supply of Sydney's water. Now, over 100 years since the Upper Nepean Scheme was commissioned, the pipelines have not become obsolete, but by virtue of boosters, are still key components of Sydney's water supply system. In addition, the pipelines display superb late 19th century hydraulic construction techniques which were state-of-the-art technology of the time in Australia. Also, the three pipelines laid side by side illustrate the advancements in major pipeline construction over a span of some 37 years. Pipeline No.1(1888) was constructed from wrought iron, Pipeline No. 2 (1900) from mild steel and Pipeline No.3 (1925) from electrically welded steel plates. Finally, it was the changeover from open canal to No. 1 pipeline that gave Pipehead its name, further adding to the significance of the pipelines. The site is now arguably the most important operations and control centre for Sydney's water supply system. The pipes are a visual feature of the landscape along which they run. The physical curtilage of the Pipehead to Potts Hill Pipelines extends to the boundary of Sydney Water Corporation land along the route of the pipelines. The curtilage includes the pipelines and all infrastructure associated with the pipelines such as valve houses, flow metres, cross-connections and pumping stations (s.170 register, 1990). The development of this water supply scheme from the late 19th century to the end of the 20th is evident in the intact fabric, layout and views to the Pipehead Site. The site is a rare industrial landscape containing physical evidence of former and changing work practices - especially the practices involved in water screening, boosting and pumping. The site is unique in both type and scale of operation, with regards to Sydney in particular and New South Wales in general. Many surviving items, such as the screening deck, are notable for their rarity, technological qualities and construction (Steginger & Associates (B), 2008, 25). Pipehead, water supply canal and associated works was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.

Sergei A. Abramov in 1989 and Marko Petkov≈°ek in 1992 described an algorithm which finds all polynomial solutions of those recurrence equations with polynomial coefficients. The algorithm computes a degree bound for the solution in a first step. In a second step an ansatz for a polynomial of this degree is used and the unknown coefficients are computed by a system of linear equations. This article describes this algorithm. In 1995 Abramov, Bronstein and Petkov≈°ek showed that the polynomial case can be solved more efficiently by considering power series solution of the recurrence equation in a specific power basis (i.e. not the ordinary basis (x^n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N}). Other algorithms which compute rational or hypergeometric solutions of a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients also use algorithms which compute polynomial solutions.  Degree bound  Let \\\\mathbb{K} be a field of characteristic zero and \\\\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \\\\, y (n+k) = f(n) a recurrence equation of order r with polynomial coefficients p_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [n], polynomial right-hand side f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n] and unknown polynomial sequence y(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n].

Diploma Thesis, Johannes Kepler Universit√§t Linz  Algorithm  The algorithm consists of two steps. In a first step the degree bound is computed.

It was built from 1837. The historic precinct includes Belmore Basin, Government Dam, Government Basin, Stockade Point, Flagstaff Hill, Signal Hill, Brighton Beach, Boat Harbour and Fortress Hill. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 May 2010.  History  =Pre-European= Prior to European occupation of the Illawarra, Wollongong Harbour and coastline was used by the Dharawal people as a natural harbour and sheltered area for all manner of cultural and ceremonial activities for more than 20,000 years and possibly as many as 40,000 years. The natural bay was protected from direct ocean currents and south-easterly winds by the sand dunes and Flagstaff Hill. Smiths Creek provided fresh water and there was an abundance of food from the combined marine and riparian environment. Archaeological evidence of this extended occupation by the Aboriginal people is found in extensive middens in the area.B Rogers. The Coke Works ion Flagstaff Point, Wollongong 1875-1890 =European= European occupation dates from 1815 when Dr Charles Throsby and his stockman herded cattle from Glenfield via Appin and down the escarpment at Bulli and established grazing grounds near the present Harbour. John Oxley surveyed the area in 1816 and land grantees were allowed to make selections in that year. From the 1820s, the area now known as Brighton Beach was used as the shipping point for the newly settled area. Vessels would stand off from the beach and shipments of supplies and produce and timber destined for the Sydney market would be transferred by small flat bottomed boats or floated out. In 1829, the Regiment that had been stationed at Red Point, south of the present day Port Kembla, was relocated to the Boat Harbour [Brighton Beach] together with the convicts under their command. The construction of government buildings, barracks to accommodate the soldiers, a residence for the Commandant and a stockade for the convicts adjacent to the Harbour marks the establishment of this area as the main commercial, judicial and administrative centre for Wollongong. Following a visit to the Illawarra in April 1834 Governor Bourke, proclaimed the Town of Wollongong as surveyed by the Surveyor General of New South Wales Major Thomas Mitchell. The 1835 Mitchell plan proposed the construction of a harbour for the protection of the small boats that provisioned the garrison. Mitchell proposed convict labour be used to lessen construction costs. Mitchell's plan also included a breakwater that extended in a straight line from Wollongong Headland. There is no evidence that this breakwater was started. In 1837, Governor Bourke instructed the Colonial Engineer Captain George Barney of the Royal Engineers to design and oversee the construction of a harbour at Wollongong. Barney's design was for a basin 100 ft long, 35 feet wide and 8 feet deep at low tide with a stone pier that incorporated a slipway for the Pilot Boat on the northern side at the sheltered end of Boat Harbour. The excavation was to be carried out by drilling and blasting behind a coffer dam. After construction commenced in 1837, it was reported in 1841 that the size of the basin was to be increased to 300 feet long and 150 feet wide. The work was carried out by up to 300 convicts. Mooring chains were laid across the bay to Brighton Beach in 1839 to provide safe anchorage for vessels up to 300 tons during the construction of the Basin. Dimension sandstone was prepared from the excavated rock and was used to construct the vertical sea walls, including the Quay wall at the eastern end of Brighton Beach and the Pier and Pier Head that formed the northern side or breakwater of this first basin. The two basal courses of the sea walls are of dressed quartz sandstone blocks and the upper portions of the sea walls are constructed from less durable sandstone stone blocks. The bases of the sea walls are keyed into the parent rock and the blocks of stone were laid on a thin lime mortar bed and joints. Non-selected rubble was compacted behind the newly constructed walls and in the case of the Central Pier it was founded in part on laid dimension stone. The surplus fill was used to reclaim the area behind the Quay wall and east of the Central Pier. Final adjustments to the facing walls were made using a diving bell that had been brought from England to be used in the construction of the Semi-circular Quay in Sydney Harbour. Construction of the Basin was completed on 25 November 1844 at a cost of ¬£3,465 and it could accommodate coasting vessels from 5 to 20 tons. However, because of incomplete removal of the coffer dams, the entrance depth at low water was only 5 feet 6 inches and the continued presence of the anchorage chain across the mouth of the Basin meant that the anchorage was unsafe. The growing need for sea transport capable of handling large volumes of bulk cargo was reflected in developments at Wollongong Harbour, which was the only public shipping place north of Shellharbour. In 1856 a timber jetty was constructed westward from the Quay on the southern side of what is now Belmore Basin, to accommodate the rapidly increasing traffic, but this proved only a temporary expedient. The Kiama Steam Navigation Company erected a large weighbridge in 1858 to weigh coal carts. In 1858 the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company was formed through the merger of the Kiama, Wollongong, and Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Companies. The screw steamer SS Illawarra was too big to berth in the basin and in 1858 a petition for improved and enlarged harbour facilities, essentially to provide for the prospect of a large coal trade, was presented to the Governor Sir William Denison. In July that year, Denison and Edward Orpen Moriarty, the NSW Department of Public Works Engineer in Chief for Harbours and River Navigation visited Wollongong to inspect the port. Following their visit, plans were prepared for the deepening and extension of the harbour to the north-east by the construction of a significant extension to the existing basin and for the construction of the eastern breakwater. In January 1859 plans and estimates for additional harbour accommodation were approved and ¬£26,892 was voted towards deepening the old basin to 10 feet, the formation of a new basin opening into the existing one and the formation of a breakwater for the protection of the outer roadstead. The new basin was to be 300 feet long, 102 feet wide and 10 feet deep at low tide and the stone excavated was to be used to construct the new breakwater. Works of this character and magnitude were new to the Colony and though tenders were invited twice, the first time in December 1860, no satisfactory offer was obtained. As the Government of New South Wales could not get the work done under one contract, it reluctantly subdivided the work into a number of smaller contracts with the Government providing the necessary major construction plant. Work commenced in August 1861 when the SS Kembla brought down the necessary plant. A substantial coffer dam was constructed across the entrance of the old basin to allow the new works to be constructed in the dry. Before work extending the Harbour was completed, it became clear that the facilities would not be adequate to cater for the expanding coal trade at the port. A decision was taken to further increase the size to 455 feet by 153 feet. In 1864 Parliament voted ¬£5,000 for this work . Up to this time, coal had been sent to Sydney in small vessels for the purpose of transhipment to foreign ports. To meet the berthing requirements of larger ships that had a deeper draught, Parliament was asked, in 1866, for ¬£10,000 to allow the Basin to be deepened to 18 feet [at low water]. However, the inner basin deepened to 18 feet and the existing basin was only deepened to 14 feet. The walls of the Basin were brought up to the design level using two basal layers of quartz sandstone keyed into the parent rock, and upper portions of the sea walls were again constructed from lithic sandstone blocks that had been prepared from the lithic sandstone that had been won as part of the construction of the new basin. Non-selected rubble was compacted behind the newly constructed walls. The surplus fill was used to reclaim the area behind the Quay wall and east of the Central Pier, the start of what was to become the Lighthouse Breakwater and local roadworks. At this time a further 3000 pounds was voted for the construction of three high-level timber coal staithes connecting to the Mount Keira and Mount Pleasant rail lines. The staithes were elevated platforms on timber trusses, somewhat like bridges, that came off the terrace to the south above the Basin and were connected to the tramways. They allowed coal laden skips to off-load their coal into chutes that led into the holds of colliers berthed in the Basin. Each staithe had the potential to load up to 1000 tons a day. After seven years and an expenditure of ¬£44,892 the extension to the original Basin was completed. The harbour now provided 1748 feet of wharfage; sufficient for 15 vessels to moor alongside. Lady Belmore, the wife of the then Governor, opened the new basin on 6 October 1868 and named it Belmore Basin. During construction of Belmore Basin, the area towards the Pier Head was widened and partially filled and the eastern half of the current Central Pier was constructed to incorporate a widened Pilot's Slipway and stone steps to the outer harbour. Mt Pleasant Tramway - Cutting with Wollongong Harbour in the background (Date unknown within 1884‚Äì1917, Tyrrell Photographic Collection, Powerhouse Museum.) In 1862 the newly constructed tramway of the Mt Pleasant Coal and Iron Co Ltd. brought the first load of coal from its mine to the harbour. The line approached the harbour along the foreshore from North Beach and the alignment is clearly identified by the present cycleway. Both the Mt Pleasant Mine and Mt Keira Mine tramways were initially 3 feet 9 inches gauge but in 1879 they were widened to standard gauge - 4 feet 8 1/2 inches, when steam locomotives replaced the horse drawn skips thereby dramatically increasing the capacity of the mines to deliver coal to the port. The planned eastern breakwater was built between 1867 and 1869 using stone excavated from the construction of the basin. The breakwater lighthouse was not part of the original plans of the 1859 Moriarty harbour improvements. In 1867, following a deputation to the Minister of Public Works, it was agreed a lighthouse would be constructed. Prior to 1867 the entrance to the harbour was marked with a beacon atop a pole at the end of the Pier Moriarty made a visit to Wollongong Harbour in January 1870 in company with the Minister and Colonial Architect James Barnet, and again later in June to select a site for a proposed lighthouse (the Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse). Tenders were called in October with the successful tenderer a Joseph Mather. The final cost of the lighthouse, including foundations and lantern house and light was in the vicinity of 3451 pounds. The original light apparatus was dismantled around 1970 and the light permanently extinguished in 1974 but the fabric was substantially restored in 1999-2000 under a State Funded conservation program at a cost of $100,000. In 1873 a timber wharf, henceforth known as the Steamer Wharf, was built, replacing an earlier 1856 timber wharf. This was the second of three wharf constructions on this site, the last being the present wharf that was constructed in the 1980s. In 1875-76 the first coke ovens in the Illawarra, eventually two batteries of six ovens, were built for James Osborne, who was associated with the Mt Keira Colliery, and William Ahern. They were established for the manufacture of coke, salt and firebricks. The coke produced from slack coal from the Mt Keira colliery was used both domestically and exported from the port. As an adjunct to the coke making, the heat produced was to be used to produce salt in salt pans by evaporating sea water. The business was later extended to produce bone dust. The business failed and the materials from the demolished batteries were used in the upgrade of the Mt Keira railroad. A second set of two bee-hive ovens were built in the same area by William Ashley. These were successfully operated until the lease expired in 1890. These ovens were demolished in 1892. During roadwork construction the remains of the two bee hive ovens were unearthed. The ovens were recorded and re-covered as a conservation measure. An interpretive sign is now located on the refilled site. T-Jetty and its steam crane in the foreground with Steamer Wharf in the background. (Date unknown, within 1887‚Äì1917, Tyrrell Photographic Collection, Powerhouse Museum). A timber T jetty designed and constructed by the NSW Department of Public Works was built in 1880 to increase the harbour's cargo handling capacity. At the same time, the harbour rail system was extended onto the Tee Jetty. The jetty was serviced by a derrick crane that was positioned on the outer edge of the jetty. The winch was powered by steam from a vertical boiler. In 1881, to prevent waves from washing into the Basin during heavy seas and to protect the coal wagons crossing to the T Jetty, a sandstone block wall up to 12 feet high was constructed on the seaward side of the Basin and another wall constructed between Pulpit Rock and the base of the Cliff. At this time, the railway was also extended around the eastern and northern sides of the Basin. In 1885, a fourth coal staithe was built in line with the original three, a smaller high- level coaling staithe was constructed to service the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company wharf at the southern end of the original Basin and two 15 ton quayside steam cranes were erected on the northern side of Belmore basin. The four straits provided a loading capacity of 150 tons per hour. The two 15 ton steam cranes were able to load 100 tons an hour and a third could handle 120 a fourth larger crane was able to load 200 tons per hour. The need for defence installations around Wollongong harbour had been raised as early as 1839 by Barney but went unanswered until the 1879 when in answer to calls for artillery to reinforce the newly formed rifle corps, a three-gun battery was established on the northern side of Flagstaff Hill facing the harbour approaches. The three guns were surplus 1861 vintage 68-pounder smooth bore muzzle loaders. A 12-pounder gun that was placed adjacent to the 3 guns was used as the 1 o'clock gun. In 1983, these guns were restored and placed in their present position on reconstructed carriages. An interpretive sign is located near the three guns. By the mid 1880s, calls were again renewed for the construction of permanent gun emplacements. Colonel Scratchley and Commander Howard RN reported that enemy cruisers could steam off the coast out of range of obsolete weapons and demand bunker coal from ports such as Newcastle and Wollongong in return for not bombarding them. Taking on board this advice, the government accepted that it was vital new defence plans be made. The Royal Commissions in the 1880s led to a Report on Defence in NSW being submitted to Parliament in 1887. The defence system that was agreed upon proposed fixed fortifications with adequate protection for the defenders to be built to defend the Colony's vital ports at Newcastle, Sydney Harbour and Wollongong. In the case of Wollongong, the report recommended that a defence system comprising a concealed emplacement at Flagstaff Hill and two smaller emplacements to the north and south be built. The gun at Flagstaff Hill was to be a very large gun to be placed under cover near the summit of Flagstaff Hill and capable of being traversed so it could fire in any direction. The gun was to be powerful enough to sink any ship from Port Kembla in the south, the Five Islands seaward and Bulli to the north. In 1887 the Department of Public Works Military Works Branch called tenders for emplacements to be built at Cliff Road Smiths Hill and at Signal Hill. The Signal Hill emplacement was built in 1890 and had a battery of one Vickers Armstrong Mark V 6 inch breech loading hydro-pneumatic disappearing gun that was located in a deep circular pit. The pit was connected by tunnels to the magazine and shell stores, casemate, flanking depression range finder and observation posts, two machine gun posts and the entrance to the Battery from the Battery yard. To save costs, the Smith's Hill emplacement had a battery of two 80 pound rifled muzzle loader guns from the Royal Gun factory at Woolwich and was built in 1891‚Äì92. During the period from 1860 to what was almost the peak of Wollongong's coal trade in 1889, coal exports increased more or less with the capacity of the port to service it. In 1870, 70,000 tons were exported rising to over 700,000 tons in 1889. In 1885 Wollongong Harbour cleared 1,624 vessels. The average annual export of butter from the port was 1,600,000 pounds. The port of Wollongong was now at its peak, and in terms of cargo handled was the third largest port in New South Wales after Sydney and Newcastle. This importance was to be short lived. The impact of the increasing coal trade at the harbour was most evident between the 1860s and 1920s when the harbour was encircled by railway lines. From the 1860s it was the central port for all the Illawarra collieries. The timber coal staithes, provided high level loading facilities that allowed coal to be tipped into chutes directly into the holds of the sailing ships and coastal steamers that visited the port. However, the escalating activity at the harbour reduced the public amenity of the area and was a contributing factor in the move of the town focus to Market Square in the 1870s and subsequently to Crown Street in the 1880s when the government railway came to Wollongong. The Wollongong Harbour Trust Act of 1889 empowered its commissioners to construct a convenient, safe and commodious harbour and to develop an extensive dock or basin in Tom Thumb Lagoon connected to the Harbour. Earlier in 1885, the NSW Government had sought the advice of the British engineer Sir John Coode, a leading authority on harbour design and construction who had visited Wollongong in 1885. Coode's proposal, that was adopted by the commissioners, was to form a harbour enclosing an area of 107 acres by means of two breakwaters, the Eastern Breakwater running north from Pulpit Rock and the northern one in a south easterly direction from Para [now Fairy] Creek. Some evidence remains today of the start made on the northern breakwater which was to run from Pulpit Rock. However, in the depressed times finance was not forthcoming and the work was abandoned. Early in 1893 a start was made to construct a breakwater running north from the Breakwater Lighthouse, but this was halted after only 240 feet had been built. The death knell of the harbour as a coal port probably commenced in 1883 when the Mount Kembla Coal and Oil Company constructed a jetty at Port Kembla. The Southern Coal Company followed suit in 1887 with both jetties being connected to the mines by rail and in 1888, both jetties to the Sydney to South Coast railway. These new jetties allowed ships of up to 4000 tons to be loaded. At Wollongong the limit was about 800 tons, but most vessels were under 300 tons. The capacity to load coal directly into large steamships eliminated the need for small coastal colliers to carry coal to Port Jackson for transhipment. The Customs House of the Port was originally a small weatherboard building on Brighton Lawn at the foot of Harbour Street, but when the Department of Justice moved in 1885 to the new Courthouse in Market Street, the old Courthouse became the office and residence of the Customs Officer. The coming of the Government railway to Wollongong in 1888 broke the region's total dependence on sea transport and spelt the end of the steamship passenger service to Wollongong, the railway being a more reliable, faster, less expensive means of transport. Port Kembla had the advantage of being a safe harbour with deep moorings that accommodated much larger vessels than could be brought into Wollongong Harbour. In 1898, the Port Kembla Harbour Act ensured the future of Port Kembla as the major port. Wollongong Harbour's decline was rapid. By 1901, Wollongong Harbour no longer traded regularly with other ports, except Sydney. The Mt Keira and Mt Pleasant mines continued to bring coal to the port for shipment to the domestic Sydney market. Cessation of coal exports in 1936, led to the demolition of the coal staithes, quayside cranes and rail lines and associated infrastructure were gradually dismantled and the last staithe disappeared around 1937. In 1937 the new Wollongong Head Lighthouse constructed on Flagstaff Point came into service and took over from the Breakwater Lighthouse as the major light in the area. This lighthouse was constructed using local labour under the supervision of Department of Transport and Shipping. The cost of the tower was (Pounds)6,800 with plant and equipment a further ¬£2,607. It was one of the first fully automated flashing light to be installed in NSW. In 1937, Wollongong Council announced its intention to reclaim the harbour foreshores as well as the now disused Mt Pleasant and Mt Keira railways. Over the ensuing eight years, the owners of this land, Australian Iron & Steel, gradually transferred title to the council. The Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company [ISCSN Co] finally abandoned the unprofitable Wollongong service in 1948, severing the last passenger and goods link between Wollongong harbour and other coastal ports. As colliers vacated the wharfage in the late 19th and early 20th century, fishing vessels and later leisure craft filled the vacuum. In 1909, the wooden steam tug ss Dumaresq was built at Wollongong Harbour. Hardwood timber was sourced from the NSW South Coast - ironbark from Pebbly Beach and spotted gum from Termeil was carried by sea to Wollongong aboard the wooden steamer ss Our Elsie - and kauri pine, for top-sides and decking, from New Zealand. The hull of the tug was launched 'broadside' between the location of the existing Coast Guard building and the breakwater, where there is now a rock-filled seawall on the land-side of the existing slipway. She is probably the only vessel built at Wollongong Harbour. Since 1948 most of the principal changes at Wollongong Harbour have been associated with removal of working appliances associated with a trading port - cranes, the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company coaling staithe and store, and the pier head on the southern side of the entrance to Belmore Basin. The Pilot/Harbourmaster was withdrawn in 1955 and the station closed. The remaining buildings associated with the station were progressively demolished in the 1960s. In the 1960s a slipway capable of handling large fishing vessels was constructed near the Lighthouse breakwater and in 1966-67 the Northern breakwater was constructed to provide safe anchorage for pleasure craft so the only vessels using Belmore Basin were the commercial fishing fleet. Later additions to the area have been the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol building on the Central Pier Head (1971), and a commercial building containing the Fishermans Cooperative and restaurants and cafes. During the 1980s a timber public jetty was constructed in the vicinity of the former 1856 ISN Co jetty and the 1873 ISCN Co later ISCNSN Co Ltd replacement jetty. The Basin is currently used as the port for the locally based commercial fishing fleet and safe mooring for recreational boats. Facilities around the Basin include the Fishermen's Cooperative receival facility and retail sales, slipway and workshops, restaurant and cafes and headquarters of the local Australian Volunteer Coastal Patrol. The Outer Harbour provides safe mooring for recreational vessels and a jetty for visiting vessels. The balance of the curtilage is in high demand as open space, scenic viewing points and recreation including swimming.  Description  The Wollongong Harbour Precinct is an area that includes Wollongong Head, Belmore Basin and the Outer Harbour and breakwaters, Brighton Lawn, Mt Pleasant and Mt Keira tramways alignment, the beachfront north from the Harbour Northern Breakwater including the two ocean baths. The precinct also includes Smith's Hill Fort on Cliff Road, Osborne Park on the western side of Cliff Road and the Old Court House and the Customs House on the corner of Harbour Street and Cliff Road. It is bounded to the north by the southern boundary of the NSW State Heritage listed North Beach Precinct, Cliff Road to the west, the southern side of Wollongong Head to the south and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The major features of heritage interest contained within this area are: ;Belmore Basin The block walled harbour [dimension dressed stone vertical sea walls with lime mortar joints]- now referred to as Belmore Basin is a combination of the 1837- 44 constructed Quay, curved basin and Central Pier and the 1861-1868 extension [and deepening] of the Harbour. The vertical dressed stone sea-walls have been built from imported quartz sandstone for the base courses and lithic sandstone won from the excavated material. As part of the Harbour 1860s improvements a high coursed random stone wall was constructed on the southern side of the Harbour as part of the infrastructure needed for the three high level staithes [and a later fourth staithe] that projected from the upper terrace of the wall. Some bollards and mooring rings remain in-situ around the Basin. ;Pilots Slipway The present slipway located in the Central Pier was developed from the original 1844 slipway, it was extended in the 1860s harbour development and later extension in 1905. There is evidence of the boatshed and mechanism that was used to winch the Pilot Boat from the harbour. ;Belmore Basin/Breakwater Lighthouse: The lighthouse is constructed from a prefabricated, shaped inch wrought iron boiler plate that was later riveted vertically and horizontally on-site to an iron skeleton framework to form the tower. The lighthouse is 42 feet high, 13 feet diameter at its base, diminishing by concave batter to 8 feet diameter at the top. The base of the tower is set on a bull-nosed sandstone foundation that sits on top of a substantial concrete foundation block. An elegant lantern house sits at the top of the tower. The lantern house has an outer gallery of cast iron supported on ornamental brackets, with Barnet style ornamental railing. The framework of the lantern house is gun-metal and is glazed with polished plate-glass 3/4 inch thick. The roof and surmounting finial are of copper. The lighthouse has high level port-hole style windows and a door one storey up that was accessed by a ladder. Access between the three timber floors is by steel ladders. The ground level door is an addition. The light - originally a fixed one is of fourth order construction on the cata-dioptric principle and manufactured by Chance Brothers Ltd, Birmingham The lens used state-of-the-art prisms to maximise the light from the vegetable oil lit lamp. This was later converted to acetylene gas in 1883 and later again to electricity. ;1880 T Jetty Crane Pedestal This feature comprises a substantial concrete pedestal and an embedded forged iron support column that is isolated in an embayment of the Outer Harbour. This is all that remains of a steam crane that provided a lifting facility for a timber T jetty that was built in the Outer Harbour in 1880. The jetty was demolished around 1930. ;Outer Harbour The Outer Harbour elements consist of: * the Moriarty 1869 rubble mound breakwater [now precast concrete block armoured and concreted over] - on which the lighthouse stands, * a short rubble mound concrete block armoured spur breakwater that projects into the ocean that the short-lived Wollongong Harbour Trust League constructed in the 1890s, and * the northern rubble mound breakwater that was constructed in 1966‚Äì67. The breakwaters have been subjected to periodic repair following storm damage and settlement since their construction. * a sandstone block wall on the seaward side of the Basin that was constructed in 1881 and another of similar height that was constructed at the same time between Pulpit Rock and the cliff face. The walls measure up to 12 feet high. A 4 feet high rubble embankment that connects the larger wall to Pulpit Rock has largely disappeared. ;Brighton Lawn and Beach This area over time has changed significantly from originally a sandy shingle beach from where produce was transshipped to waiting vessels. Created in 1870 from sand dredged from the harbour, the raised terrace area - later known as Brighton Lawn Reserve, named by Governor Bourke in 1840 to conjure up visions of Brighton Beach in Britain, was the site of the first Customs House. The Mt Pleasant and Mt Keira tram lines ran around its periphery. In the 1880s twelve Norfolk Island pines were planted in an arc on the Reserve and five seats were installed under these trees. Two of the original trees remain. Following the removal of the tramways in the 1930s, the area has been heavily landscaped with the addition of sealed parking areas, concrete paths, kiosk and toilet block. The foreshore of the elevated Lawn is protected by gabions and these have failed and now need restoration. Apart from the original convict Quay wall little remains of this part of the 19th century harbour. ;Wollongong Head Lighthouse The Wollongong Head lighthouse is a reinforced concrete tower 9 feet 10 inches in diameter standing 83 feet high from top of foundation to top of ventilator. The external surface of the tower is decorated with a 16 feet blind arch colonnade below a prominent cornice and, above this for 50 feet the tower has 1 foot wide vertical, evenly-spaced flutings, above which is a panelled parapet, balcony and lantern. Four slit windows to provide light to the internal stairwell are spaced helically around the tower and fit within the flutes. A doorway at ground level gives access to a cantilevered internal spiral staircase to the trapdoor in the lantern room floor. The lantern room is surrounded by a balcony that has a gun-metal railing, with a zigzag detail. ;Flagstaff Hill Fort In 1881 a three-gun battery was established on the northern side of Flagstaff Hill facing the Harbour approaches. The three guns were surplus 1861 vintage 68-pounder muzzle loaders. A 12-pounder gun that was placed adjacent to the 3 guns was used as the 1 o'clock gun. In 1983, these guns were restored and placed in their present position on reconstructed carriages. An interpretive sign is located near the three guns. The fortification that can be seen today is the deep 1890 circular concrete pit - excavated into the hillside, that contained an Armstrong and Co Mark V 6 inch breech loading hydro pneumatic disappearing gun mounted in the pit. In the gun pit can be seen doorways to the tunnels that lead back into the hill to the underground cartridge and shell stores and the casemate. The gun emplacement was flanked by a depression range finder position and an observation station connected by underground passages to the Fort. There were also two machine gun posts on the southern side of the Fort. The entrance to the underground stores is through a brick wall, that has one doorway and two window openings, set into the hillside on the southern side of the emplacement. It can be seen from the car park that originally was the battery yard. The filled in gun pit was dug out in 1999‚Äì2000. No remains of the guns survive other than the embedded metal circular track on the floor of the gun pit on which the gun carriage rotated. ;Chain Baths/Nuns' Pool Ladies and children bathed in a secluded cove that was located on the northern tip of Flagstaff Point. The baths were first recorded in the 1830s as a ladies swimming place when convict labour erected a hut and improved access to the natural swimming hole. In 1842 Governor Gipps directed that convict labour be used to improve the pool and a path was built down the cliff to access the pool and ropes were strung across the cove to aid swimmers. In 1897, chains replaced the ropes and the pool then became known as the Ladies' Chain Baths. Largely superseded by the Ladies' Baths that were built further south in the 20th century, the Chain Baths became favoured by the nuns at a nearby convent and, over time, the pool became known as the Nuns' Pool. The remains of the baths can be seen today. ;Ladies' Baths All that remains of the Ladies' Baths that were built on the southern side of Wollongong Head is a set of low concrete weirs retaining water on three sides of a natural depression in the rock. In use from the mid 1850s, the Ladies' Baths was converted by deepening into a proper bathing place in 1887. A timber dressing shed stood on the rock shelf above and west of the pool with steps leading down the hillside to the pool. From the 1960s, segregated bathing was no longer so popular. However the baths and adjacent children's baths have continued to receive limited use. ;Coke Ovens Site Coke was produced on this site from 1875 using unsaleable coal fines. Coke was produced in two batteries of six coke ovens. A downturn in profitability saw the plant sold off in 1879 and dismantled. Two new ovens were then constructed in 1885, producing coke until 1890. The coke was used locally but the majority was shipped to the Sydney market. ;The Old Court House and Customs Office Situated south of the Harbour Street and Cliff Road intersection within the former Government Reserve established in 1833, is the 1858 brick and stone Court House building. The Old Court House replaced an earlier timber structure and served the district until 1885, when the current Market Street Courts were opened. The building was then used as a Customs House under State control until Federation, when the customs post was transferred to Port Kembla. In 1901, the building was transferred to the Australian Army for use as a drill hall. In 1974 TS Albatross Naval Cadets moved from their facilities at the Harbour and occupied the site until Wollongong City Council acquired the site and the buildings were restored in 2000. The weatherboard Customs Office, dating from c 1880, was relocated from Brighton Lawn to the former Government Reserve in 1887 and moved again to its present location at the southern edge of the site in 1938 to allow for extensions to the Old Court House. The building was used as the Officers' Mess during the TS Albatross era. The buildings have been well maintained and are now used as meeting rooms for community organisations and an exhibition venue. ;Mt Keira Osborne-Wallsend Tramway Bridge Remains On the western side of Cliff Road, in Osborne Park are the remains of a timber rail bridge that spanned Smith's Creek. Built as part of the extended tramway track to transport coal from the Mt Keira Osborne-Wallsend escarpment coal mine to Wollongong Harbour, the line was officially opened in 1864. It joined the tramway track from the Mt Pleasant coal mine approximately 100 metres east of the bridge. The line operated until 1933, after which the rails were removed and the deck was lifted from the bridge. In 1997, the remaining trestles of the bridge were stabilised and further recording, repair and site interpretation was carried out. ;North Wollongong Ocean Baths, Men's Ocean Baths, Toddlers' Pool and Continental Baths Between Wollongong Harbour and North Beach, the coastal rock platforms have been used to house a variety of swimming pool and ocean bathing structures since the establishment of the first gentlemen's bathing place known as Clarke's Hole in 1871. The Men's Baths were the prime swimming baths for Wollongong following their excavation to 6 feet in 1899. Remains of the first changing shed existed up to the 1960s. In the 1920s, a Toddlers' Pool was built beside the Men's Baths and, in 1926, \\"continental bathing\\", where mixed-gender bathing was permitted, was introduced at the new Central Baths. Known as the Continental Baths, in the early 1960s, the rock pool was rebuilt as a salt-water Olympic pool with two adjacent recreational pools. The Continental Baths Pavilion was replaced in 1986 with a new brick facilities building. The old Men's Baths rock pool remains in use. ;Tramway Alignment, Cutting and Embankment The Tramway Alignment and cutting - once the permanent way for the Mt Pleasant tramway that conveyed coal wagons from the escarpment coal mine at Mt Pleasant to Wollongong Harbour from the 1860s to 1933, is now a pedestrian and cycleway. The first but short-lived escarpment coal mine was opened up at Mt Keira in 1849 by James Shoobert. In 1857, a second more successful mine was opened and, in the following years, mining began at Woonona, Bellambi, Coalcliff and Mount Pleasant. The Mount Pleasant Colliery began production in July 1861. The construction of a tramway gave access to Wollongong Harbour and was a crucial element in the success of the mine. The route proposed was to run an incline from the mine over Fairy Creek to North Wollongong Beach and then along the coast and the base of the cliff to Belmore Basin. The line was built under the provisions of the Mt Pleasant Tramways Act 1862.. The mined coal was conveyed on the Mount Pleasant line - as was the case for the Mt Keira coal, at first by horse drawn rake of coal wagons. The tramway was upgraded to standard gauge in 1879 and then operated as a steam railway. Mt Pleasant Colliery closed in 1933. The new owner of the coal leases and railway, Broken Hill Pty Ltd donated the land to Wollongong Council in 1938. The Mt Pleasant tramway alignment that runs along the beachfront is now used as a promenade and cycleway. ;Smiths Hill Fort - Battery Park [Fortress Hill] The Smith's Hill Battery was constructed 1892-93 was a three gun emplacement. The battery consists of a wall with three semi circular parapets. The two larger northern emplacements contain the original 1872 80-pounder rifled muzzle-loader guns that had been manufactured at the Royal Gun Factory at Woolwich UK. The southern emplacement housed a 1 1/2 inch Nordenfelt quick-firing gun. Along the wall are eight recesses, for shells and cartridges and a large casemate to provide protection for the gunners. These are closed off with wooden doors. Off-set to the north was an underground magazine that includes a cartridge store, ammunition store, workshop and lamp store. Rain water was collected from the paved areas into a series of underground overflow water tanks. A depression range finder station was located on the northern end of the site. By the early 1900s, Federal government reorganisation of the army and advances in gunnery technology led to the closure of the Smith's Hill [and Flagstaff Hill] Fort. The forts came under the control of Wollongong Council. Later the Flagstaff Hill embankments were levelled and the entrances bricked up. The Smith's Hill entrances were sealed and the site filled with boiler ash to create a park. In 1988, the site was excavated and the fort and the guns and their mountings were restored. Interpretive signage is located at the site. = Condition = ;Belmore Basin The condition of the Basin's heritage sea- walls, both below and above the tidal zone, varies from reasonable to good. However, there are areas of concern resulting from: * localised erosion of the poorer quality lithic sandstone bedrock resulting in undercutting in the intertidal zone, voids where mortar is missing; * weathering of the more exposed or poorer quality lithic sandstone blocks * movement of a section of the 1844 Central Pier wall * ongoing movement evidenced by cracking of block work, rotation of portion of the wall and settlement behind the wall of the Basin wall of the 1844 Central Pier The need for maintenance and stabilisation of the more affected sections of the 1844 walls is imperative and if not carried out over the next few years these walls could become unstable and fail. There are also concerns of localised accelerated weathering of some of the sandstone blocks resulting from the use of hard cement mortar that was used to carry out earlier repairs. This comment is also applicable to the staith wall and sea walls. ;Other Major Features The other noted heritage features included in the Precinct are in good condition requiring only appropriate ongoing maintenance. The condition of buried features such as the bee hive coke ovens is unknown. The Harbour retains the configuration and scale of a coastal 19th century trading port that was developed over time for the shipping of resources into the district and the shipping to market of significant products of the Illawarra, in particular coal. It is an easy exercise to envisage Wollongong Harbour and its attendant infrastructure in operation when in the 1880s it was the third most active port on the Colony of NSW. The Wollongong Harbour precinct includes the following features that are not possessed to anywhere near the same degree by the other harbours and their surrounding precincts: * the original configuration of a 19th-century harbour with associated infrastructure such as the breakwaters, sandstone block quay walls, breakwater lighthouse, staith foundations, access roadways, coal tramways and slipway, within a harbour design influenced by British practice at the time; * associated features such as the 19th century Old Court House and Customs House, coke ovens and fortifications to protect an important and developing outpost of the Colony; * the public amenity of the 19th century ocean bathing pools established as the town developed  Heritage listing  Wollongong Harbour Precinct is of State significance because it displays the infrastructure on which the first southern port outside Sydney was founded and developed at Wollongong. It also provides evidence of the measures taken to defend that important southern outpost of the colony. The Precinct includes fabric deriving from each stage of its development from the substantially intact 19th century convict-built harbour together with modifications made as it developed from a commercial harbour to its present function as a fishing and tourist port. The harbour was the first port in the Illawarra and is the oldest and most intact extant block walled harbour in NSW. It comprises the Belmore Basin (the block walled harbour); the 1869 rubble mound breakwater; mooring rings, other related appurtenances and remnants of facilities left as the harbour developed. Also included in the Precinct is the 1872 Breakwater lighthouse, one of the early lighthouses of NSW and one of only two wrought iron lighthouses in NSW - the other being at Ulladulla and built to the same design by the same engineer, Joseph Mather of Sydney. *Other inclusions in the precinct are * the 1937 Wollongong Head lighthouse; * the 1858 brick and stone Old Court House and the weatherboard Customs Office; * the remains of the 1891 Flagstaff Hill Fort; * the remains of the 1893 Smiths Hill Fort (Battery Park); * the remains of the Nuns' Pool/Chain Baths dating from the 1830s; * the remains of the Ladies' Baths dating from the mid 1850s; * the Men's Ocean Baths dating from c.1871; * the Mt Pleasant tramway alignment, cutting and embankment - once the permanent way along which from the 1860s to 1933, coal wagons were conveyed from the Mt Pleasant coal mine to Wollongong Harbour; it is now a pedestrian track and cycleway; * the remains of a bridge on the alignment of the 1864 tramway that conveyed coal to the harbour from the Mt Keira Osborne-Wallsend colliery; * the buried remains of coke ovens dating from 1875. The harbour is associated with two of the most important Colonial engineers; Belmore Basin was constructed under George Barney, Commanding Royal Engineer and Colonial Engineer, and the outer harbour under Edward Orpen Moriarty, first Engineer-in-Chief, Harbours & Rivers of the Public Works Department, whose work included the Breakwater lighthouse. The Harbour was essential to the development of Wollongong and was the focus of Wollongong's commercial, administrative, judicial and social activities from the early 19th century until well into the 20th century. The cluster of ocean baths shows the evolution of public bathing from the gender-segregated pools in use from the 19th century as represented by the 1830s Nuns Pool, the 1850s Ladies Baths and the 1871 Men's Ocean Baths, to the introduction of mixed (or continental) bathing in the Men's Baths between the First and Second World Wars, and development in the 1960s of the latter into a complex with an Olympic-size pool and children's pool. The old courthouse is one of the earliest designed and built by the newly reorganised Colonial Architect's office after self- government in 1856; its design is repeated in other district court houses; The fortifications were the southernmost of the colony's defences that covered the major centres of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong and are representative of defence strategy and technology of the late 19th century; The bee-hive coke ovens are the only intact examples of their type remaining in NSW. Wollongong Harbour Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 May 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Wollongong Harbour Precinct is of State heritage significance as it clearly demonstrates the history and development of the precinct and its colonial role providing access for goods and people to and from southernmost outpost of the colony at Wollongong from the 1830s to the present day. During the 1820s, Boat Harbour as the area was then known, was a shipping point for newly settled areas. From 1829 it allowed anchorage for supply boats for the military forces garrisoned there. The Precinct contains a rare and intact example of a convict built, block walled harbour constructed between 1937 and 1844 at what was the colony of NSW southernmost outpost in the early Colonial era. The Harbour is the oldest block walled harbour in NSW. The additions alterations to the harbour which formed the Belmore Basin and the development over the years of infrastructure in the precinct such as the coal loading apparatus, rail lines, coke ovens, clearly demonstrates the Harbour precincts role in the development of Wollongong and the Illawarra and its coal industry as well as agricultural and natural resource industries. The precinct including the courthouse and customs house also reflects the important maritime role the Harbour precinct played in the development of bulk cargo coastal shipping in the colony and consequently the economic and infrastructure development of the colony. Located within the precinct are a number of fortifications from the late 19th Century which also provide evidence of the importance of this colonial outpost and the evolution of the precinct's role in defence of the colony and of the colony's defence strategy from the 1850s to the early 20th Century. The changing role of the Harbour, from an important transportation node for industry to that of the home of the Illawarra fishing fleet is also documented in the fabric of the precinct. An important aspect of the Precinct's heritage values is the evidence of the evolution of recreation and recreational uses of the Precinct. The Brighton Lawn, initially the site of the first Government reserve and associated government buildings, became a centre of recreational pursuits and remains so today. There are also three sets of sea baths within the precinct, the Chain/Nuns Baths established in the 1830s and improved using convict labour in the 1840s, the Ladies baths established in the mid 1850s and the Continental Baths which evolved out of the earlier gentlemen's and toddlers baths. The first two sets of baths were reserved for women until well into the 20th century and the Continental Baths evolved from the Gentlemen's sea baths into a mixed gender swimming venue by the 1960s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The historic significance of the Wollongong Harbour Precinct is enhanced by its association with important groups of people and figures in the development of NSW. The original Harbour, which is still in situ, was built by a 300 strong convict labour force housed in a convict stockade located on what is now known as Flagstaff Hill. The first Colonial Engineer, Captain George Barney was responsible for the design and construction supervision of the original harbour, central pier and basin wall. Among Barney's significant other works were the design and supervision of the Semi-Circular Quay in Sydney, the Newcastle Harbour Breakwater and the Victoria Barracks as well as many of the coastal defence structures in Sydney. The 1861 - 1878 extension of Wollongong Harbour into what is now known as Belmore Basin and also the Wollongong Breakwater lighthouse (1869 - 1872) was designed and overseen by Edward Orpen Moriarty, Department of Public Works Engineer in Chief, Harbours and River Navigation. Moriarty's other important colonial works included Pyrmont Bridge and several of NSW water works and supply systems such as Prospect Reservoir and Goulburn Waterworks. He designed the Trial Bay Breakwater as a way of providing a \\"haven\\" for shipping traversing the North Coast. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Harbour precinct as a whole is of State significance for its landmark qualities that have been widely recognised and established over time. The Precinct elements, especially the Harbour and headland and lighthouses contribute to the a visual distinctiveness of the area and have made the Precinct a valued asset of the city. The inclusion of the Old Courthouse and Customs Office in the precinct allows for the visual appreciation of the full function of the precinct as an important maritime port to be interpreted. In addition these landmark elements there are a variety of significant historic views and vistas which contribute to the heritage significance of the precinct as a whole. These include views from the higher land to the north of the precinct across Brighton Lawn to Belmore Basin and the Lighthouse and from Flagstaff Hill down to the rocky breakwater and Belmore Basin which reveal a pleasing blend of nature and built infrastructure which residents, workers and visitors have admired for over 100 years. The block wall harbour itself has basically remained in its 19th century configuration. It demonstrates the evolution of a 19th-century coastal harbour successfully adapting to changing cargo and associated handling technologies. Its extensive and unified use of sandstone block walls incised into the natural bedrock demonstrates a traditional construction technique and together with the timber bollards and iron mooring fixtures and fittings demonstrate a cohesive, substantially intact, distinctive mid 19th century harbour landscape which has become rare in NSW. The two lighthouses established in 1872 and 1937 and located within the precinct clearly demonstrate the evolution of technical changes in coastal navigation aids. Similarly the fortifications contained in the Precinct are representative of the defence strategy and technology of the late 19th Century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Wollongong Harbour is of State heritage significance for its research potential in providing an insight into the operation of a Colonial and early 20th Century shipping port and the infrastructure required to support a burgeoning produce and coal industries. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Wollongong Harbour Precinct is of State Heritage significance as it contains the oldest and most intact block walled harbour in NSW. The Harbour, Quay and Southern Basin are rare and substantially intact survivors of major convict harbour construction. The harbour is a rare example of a harbour that has been continuously used as a port for over 180 years. It is one of very few coastal harbours with its historic19th Century infrastructure and fittings such as timber bollard and fender piles, cast iron and wrought iron mooring fixtures, the Pilots slip rails and eyelets and the crane pedestal, still in situ. The mounts for the two 80-pounder gun for the Smith's Hill Battery are thought to be the only ones of their type remaining in NSW.

P-recursive equations are linear recurrence equations (or linear recurrence relations or linear difference equations) with polynomial coefficients. These equations play an important role in different areas of mathematics, specifically in combinatorics. The sequences which are solutions of these equations are called holonomic, P-recursive or D-finite. From the late 1980s on the first algorithms were developed to find solutions for these equations. Sergei A. Abramov, Marko Petkov≈°ek and Mark van Hoeij described algorithms to find polynomial, rational, hypergeometric and d'Alembertian solutions.  Definition  Let \\\\mathbb{K} be a field of characteristic zero (for example \\\\mathbb{K} = \\\\mathbb{Q}), p_k(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [n] polynomials for k = 0,\\\\dots,r,f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}^{\\\\N} a sequence and y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}^{\\\\N} an unknown sequence. The equation\\\\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \\\\, y (n+k) = f(n)is called a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients (all recurrence equations in this article are of this form). If p_0 and p_r are both nonzero, then r is called the order of the equation. If f is zero the equation is called homogeneous, otherwise it is called inhomogeneous. This can also be written as L y = f where L=\\\\sum_{k=0}^r p_k N^k is a linear recurrence operator with polynomial coefficients and N is the shift operator, i.e. N \\\\, y (n) = y (n+1).  Closed form solutions  Let \\\\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \\\\, y (n+k) = f(n) or equivalently Ly=f be a recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. There exist several algorithms which compute solutions of this equation. These algorithms can compute polynomial, rational, hypergeometric and d'Alembertian solutions. The solution of a homogeneous equation is given by the kernel of the linear recurrence operator: \\\\ker L = \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}^\\\\N \\\\, : \\\\, L y = 0\\\\\\\\}. As a subspace of the space of sequences this kernel has a basis.If sequences are considered equal if they are equal in almost all terms, then this basis is finite. More on this can be found in the book A=B by Petkov≈°ek, Wilf and Zeilberger. Let \\\\\\\\{ y^{(1)}, y^{(2)}, \\\\dots, y^{(m)} \\\\\\\\} be a basis of \\\\ker L, then the formal sum c_1 y^{(1)} + \\\\dots + c_m y^{(m)} for arbitrary constants c_1,\\\\dots,c_m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} is called the general solution of the homogeneous problem Ly=0. If \\\\tilde{y} is a particular solution of Ly=f, i.e. L \\\\tilde{y}=f, then c_1 y^{(1)} + \\\\dots + c_m y^{(m)} + \\\\tilde{y} is also a solution of the inhomogeneous problem and it is called the general solution of the inhomogeneous problem. = Polynomial solutions = In the late 1980s Sergei A. Abramov described an algorithm which finds the general polynomial solution of a recurrence equation, i.e. y (n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [n], with a polynomial right-hand sidef(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [n]. He (and a few years later Marko Petkov≈°ek) gave a degree bound for polynomial solutions. This way the problem can simply be solved by considering a system of linear equations. In 1995 Abramov, Bronstein and Petkov≈°ek showed that the polynomial case can be solved more efficiently by considering power series solution of the recurrence equation in a specific power basis (i.e. not the ordinary basis (x^n)_{n \\\\in \\\\N}). The other algorithms for finding more general solutions (e.g. rational or hypergeometric solutions) also rely on algorithms which compute polynomial solutions. = Rational solutions = In 1989 Sergei A. Abramov showed that a general rational solution, i.e. y(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} (n), with polynomial right-hand side f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n], can be found by using the notion of a universal denominator. A universal denominator is a polynomial u such that the denominator of every rational solution divides u. Abramov showed how this universal denominator can be computed by only using the first and the last coefficient polynomial p_0 and p_r. Substituting this universal denominator for the unknown denominator of y all rational solutions can be found by computing all polynomial solutions of a transformed equation. = Hypergeometric solution = A sequence y(n) is called hypergeometric if the ratio of two consecutive terms is a rational function in n, i.e. y (n+1) / y(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} (n). This is the case if and only if the sequence is the solution of a first-order recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. The set of hypergeometric sequences is not a subspace of the space of sequences as it is not closed under addition. In 1992 Marko Petkov≈°ek gave an algorithm to get the general hypergeometric solution of a recurrence equation where the right-hand side f is the sum of hypergeometric sequences. The algorithm makes use of the Gosper-Petkov≈°ek normal-form of a rational function. With this specific representation it is again sufficient to consider polynomial solutions of a transformed equation. A different and more efficient approach is due to Mark van Hoeij. Considering the roots of the first and the last coefficient polynomial p_0 and p_r ‚Äì called singularities ‚Äì one can build a solution step by step making use of the fact that every hypergeometric sequence y (n) has a representation of the formy (n) = c \\\\, r(n)\\\\, z^n \\\\, \\\\Gamma(n-\\\\xi_1)^{e_1} \\\\Gamma(n-\\\\xi_2)^{e_2} \\\\cdots \\\\Gamma(n-\\\\xi_s)^{e_s}for some c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}, z \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{K}}, s \\\\in \\\\N, r(n) \\\\in \\\\overline\\\\mathbb{K}(n), \\\\xi_1, \\\\dots, \\\\xi_s \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{K}} with \\\\xi_i-\\\\xi_j otin \\\\Z for i eq j and e_1, \\\\dots, e_s \\\\in \\\\Z. Here \\\\Gamma (n) denotes the Gamma function and \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{K}} the algebraic closure of the field \\\\mathbb{K}. Then the \\\\xi_1, \\\\dots, \\\\xi_s have to be singularities of the equation (i.e. roots of p_0 or p_r). Furthermore one can compute bounds for the exponents e_i. For fixed values \\\\xi_1, \\\\dots, \\\\xi_s, e_1, \\\\dots, e_s it is possible to make an ansatz which gives candidates for z. For a specific z one can again make an ansatz to get the rational function r(n) by Abramov's algorithm. Considering all possibilities one gets the general solution of the recurrence equation. = D'Alembertian solutions = A sequence y is called d'Alembertian if y = h_1 \\\\sum h_2 \\\\sum \\\\cdots \\\\sum h_k for some hypergeometric sequences h_1,\\\\dots,h_k and y=\\\\sum x means that \\\\Delta y = x where \\\\Delta denotes the difference operator, i.e. \\\\Delta y = N y - y = y (n+1) - y(n). This is the case if and only if there are first-order linear recurrence operators L_1, \\\\dots, L_k with rational coefficients such that L_k \\\\cdots L_1 y = 0. 1994 Abramov and Petkov≈°ek described an algorithm which computes the general d'Alembertian solution of a recurrence equation. This algorithm computes hypergeometric solutions and reduces the order of the recurrence equation recursively.  Examples  = Signed permutation matrices = The number of signed permutation matrices of size n \\\\times n can be described by the sequence y(n) \\\\in \\\\Q^{\\\\N}. A signed permutation matrix is a square matrix which has exactly one nonzero entry in every row and in every column. The nonzero entries can be \\\\pm 1. The sequence is determined by the linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficientsy (n) = 4(n-1)^2 \\\\, y (n-2) + 2 \\\\, y (n-1)and the initial values y(0) = 1, y(1) = 2. Applying an algorithm to find hypergeometric solutions one can find the general hypergeometric solutiony (n) = c \\\\, 2^n n!for some constant c. Also considering the initial values, the sequence y (n) = 2^n n! describes the number of signed permutation matrices. = Involutions = The number of involutions y(n) of a set with n elements is given by the recurrence equationy (n) = (n-1) \\\\, y (n-2) + y (n-1).Applying for example Petkov≈°ek's algorithm it is possible to see that there is no polynomial, rational or hypergeometric solution for this recurrence equation.  Applications  A function F(n,k) is called hypergeometric if F(n,k+1)/F(n,k), F(n+1,k)/F(n,k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}(n,k) where \\\\mathbb{K}(n,k) denotes the rational functions in n and k. A hypergeometric sum is a finite sum of the form f(n)=\\\\sum_k F(n,k) where F(n,k) is hypergeometric. Zeilberger's creative telescoping algorithm can transform such a hypergeometric sum into a recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. This equation can then be solved to get for example a linear combination of hypergeometric solutions which is called a closed form solution of f.

Following the massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniak men and boys, including her husband and two sons, Mehmedoviƒá became a vocal advocate for bringing the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre to justice. Biography Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá was born in 1952. At the outbreak of Bosnian War, Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá was a homemaker with a primary school education. She lived with her husband, Abdullah, and their sons, Azmir and Almir (who was nicknamed Lalo), in Vidikovac, just outside of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. =Srebrenica massacre= By 1995, Serb forces had overrun much of eastern Bosnia and expelled the local Bosniak population in an ethnic cleansing campaign. Their objective was to annex Serb controlled areas into neighboring Serbia. More than 40,000 people, mostly Bosniaks, took refuge in Srebrenica, one of the region's last enclaves outside Bosnian Serb control. However, the town was conquered by forces led by the Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladiƒá. Srebrenica's women were evacuated, but much of Srebrenica's male population would be killed by paramilitaries under Mladiƒá's command. Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá last saw her husband, Abdullah, and sons, Azmir, 21, and Almir, 18, in the forested hills surrounding Srebrenica before their separation. She described her final parting with her family in a November 2017 interview with a Bosnian television station, \\"We were standing there and my young one, Lalo ‚Äî that's what we called him, although his name was Almir ‚Äî was saying, 'Go on, mother, go, leave, already' as he was pulling me closer and closer, and would not let me go...We thought we‚Äôd see each other in two, three days. We did not know they‚Äôd kill them all.\\" Mehmedoviƒá was bused to the relative safety to Kladanj, a town near Tuzla. Red Cross officials later informed Mehmedoviƒá that her husband and sons were missing. More than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were killed in the massacre. Among the victims were Mehmedoviƒá's husband, sons, and her two brothers, Edhem and Hamed. =Activism= The remains of her husband and sons were later recovered within the more than 100 mass graves uncovered in the region surrounding Srebrenica. Their bodies were positively identified. In 2010, Mehmedoviƒá had them reburied at memorial cemetery for victims of the Srebrenica massacre in the nearby village of Potocari. Mehmedoviƒá lived in a suburb of Sarajevo from the late 1990s until 2002. In 2002, she moved back to her prewar home in Vidikovac, located just outside Srebrenica on the road to Potocari, despite memories of the war and massacre. Mehmedoviƒá, who was one of first Bosniaks to permanently return to the area following the Bosnian War, wanted to show that Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs could still live side-by-side. She returned to a very different area. There was little electricity in 2002 and few paved roads in region. Her only neighbor at the time was an elderly Serb man, whom she helped with chores and shopping. She stressed that she did not blame Serbs or harbor collective guilt towards them. Instead, Mehmedoviƒá began to advocate for the arrest and convictions of individual perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre. In 2002, the same year she moved back to Srebrenica, Mehmedoviƒá founded Mothers of Srebrenica, an association of women and survivors whose relatives were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. The Mothers of Srebrenica advocated for justice for the victims and collected donations for survivors and their families. She also served as the leader and president of the organization. Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá became a forceful advocate for justice for her family and the other victims of the genocide. She addressed both Bosnian and international audiences, including journalists, school students, human rights activists, neighbors, and politicians. In an interview before her death, she reiterated her support for justice for the victims, \\"We can't let those who had killed to become the same as those who had been killed. I should not be the only one who is afraid of the future in which we don‚Äôt know who was the perpetrator and who was the victim.\\" Most recently, Mehmedoviƒá had vocally opposed to growing nationalism within Bosnia. She publicly condemned politicians throughout the Balkans who denied the existence of the Srebrenica massacre or supported ethnic or sectarian division in region. In November 2017, Mehmedoviƒá traveled to The Hague, where she was present in the courtroom for the sentencing of Ratko Mladiƒá to life in prison for his role in the Srebrenica massacres. In an interview with Deutsche Welle (DW) following Mladiƒá's guilty verdict and sentencing, Mehmedoviƒá's said \\"A life sentence for Mladiƒá is just a drop in the ocean.\\" As president of the Mothers of Srebrenica, she pointed out that, even with the verdict, \\"We, the mothers, live only through the memories of our children.\\" While Mladiƒá was successfully prosecuted, she reminded observers shortly after the verdict that there were still perpetrators of other Bosnian wartime crimes against humanity at-large who needed to brought to justice as well, telling DW, \\"We are sad that he [Mladiƒá] was sentenced only for Srebrenica and not also for genocide in other Bosnian communities. The butchers are being tried, but the entity created by these crimes (the Serbian republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Republika Srpska) still exists. Their rulers want to make it a state or to annex it with Serbia. We will never accept this.\\" Mehmedoviƒá's home near Srebrenica, which she reclaimed in 2002, became a memorial for victims of the massacre. She cared for three pine trees in her yard that her son, Almir, had planted before the Bosnian War. She also preserved a cement pathway leading to her house where her son, Almir, had written his name in freshly poured concrete by the front door. Death Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá died from complications of breast cancer at a hospital in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on July 22, 2018, at the age of 65. Her death was confirmed by ƒÜamil Durakoviƒá, her friend and former Mayor of Srebrenica, who called her a \\"tough, strong woman, an incredible leader in the largely patriarchal society in which women remain mostly in the background.\\" Hundreds of people attended her funeral in Srebrenica. She was buried in the nearby village of Suƒáeska. Michael Brand, a German politician and member of the Bundestag who worked closely with Mehmedoviƒá, noted that she \\"fought like a lioness\\" on behalf of the massacre victims and their families, but \\"justice was her mission, not revenge.\\" He called her \\"a thorn in the side of people who to this day try to sweep the most serious war crimes under the carpet and rewrite history\\" and reiterated that without Mehmedoviƒá many details and perpetrators of the attacks in Srebrenica would have never been uncovered.

It has felty grey, elliptic to wedge-shaped leaves of 4‚Äì6¬Ω cm (1.8‚Äì2.6 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm wide, and very sweetly scented, globe-shaped, 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) wide, bright yellow flower heads, that are seated or on a very short stalk of ¬Ω cm long, grouped with two to four together. Its common names include is sandveld pincushion in English and sandluisie or sandveldluisiesbos in Afrikaans. The plants are in bloom between August and November. It is an endemic species that only grows in a small area of the Western Cape province of South-Africa.  Description  Leucospermum rodolentum is an upright spreading shrub of up to 3 m (10 ft) high and 4 m (13¬Ω ft) in diameter, that develops from a single trunk at its base of 8‚Äì14 cm (3¬º‚Äì4¬æ in) thick, with a smooth, grey bark. The flowering stems are rising up 5‚Äì7 mm in diameter and grey due to a dense layer of grey fine crisped hairs. The leaves are elliptic to wedge-shaped, 4‚Äì6¬Ω cm (1.8‚Äì2.6 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.3-0.6 in) wide, with a blunt or tapering base, a rounded or bitten-off tip with three to six teeth, and a grey surface due to a dense layer of fine, short, crisped hairs. The flower heads are globe-shaped, 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) across, seated or with a short stalk of up to ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) long, occurring in groups of two, three or four, rarely individually. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flattened cone-shaped, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and ¬æ cm (0.3 in) across. The greyish bracts that subtend the head are oval with a pointy tip, 5‚àí7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) long and 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) wide, tightly overlapping, cartilaginous in consistency. The carmine bract that subtends each flower individually is narrowly lance-shaped with a pointy tip, about 2 cm (0.8 in) long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, embraces the base of the perianth, is thickly woolly at its foot, powdery hairy near the tip, and is fringed by equally long hairs. The straight, deep yellow, 4-merous perianth is straight and cylinder-shaped in bud, and 1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.6‚Äì1.0 in) long. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is cylinder-shaped, about 5 mm long, hairless, and hyaline in consistency. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise is curled back in the upper half. While the claw facing the edge of the head is thinly silky hairy, the remaining three claws quickly loose any hair that might be there in the bud. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, consists of four lance-shaped with a pointy tip, are still tinged with green in bud, are about 3 mm (0.12 in) long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide, and carries very few silky hairs. From the perianth emerges a straight style of 1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.6‚Äì1.0 in), that tapers near the tip, sometimes curves slightly away from the center of the head. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is hoof-shaped to bluntly cylinder-shaped, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, with a groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four opaque, awl-shaped scales of about 1 mm long. = Differences with related species = L. rodolentum can be distinguished from other species by its tall, up to 3.0 m high, upright habit and its grey felty elliptic to wedge-shaped leaves of ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm wide. It can be distinguished from L. parile, which has red pointed bracts.  Taxonomy  The sandveld pincushion was first described by Henry Cranke Andrews in 1803. He had based his description on the living flowering plants, that he had studied in George Hibbert's conservatory at Clapham, London in 1802. These had probably been grown from seeds, that had been collected by Francis Masson. However, the name Protea candicans had already been used by Carl Thunberg in 1800 for the plant that is now called Paranomus candicans. In 1809, Richard Anthony Salisbury proposed the name Leucadendrum rodolentum in a book published by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Salisbury. In 1818 Robert Sweet combined Andrew's species name with the genus name that Robert Brown had proposed to Leucospermum candicans, which is invalid because Andrew's epithet was not available. John Patrick Rourke made the correct combination Leucospermum rodolentum In 1969. L. rodolentum has been assigned to the section Leucospermum. The species name rodolentum means ‚Ä≥smelling like roses‚Ä≥.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The sandveld pincushion can naturally be found from Darling in the south, through the Hopefield, Piketberg, and Clanwilliam districts, to the Heerenlogementberg and the Nardouw Pass. An isolated population can be found south of the Brandvlei Dam. Isolated populations near Kraaifontein (1960s) and Salt River (19th century), now a Cape Town suburb, have gone extinct due to urban expansion. The species is a prominent constituent of sandveld vegetation that grows on the sandy flats of the west of the Western Cape province, between sealevel and 250 m (800 ft) or rarely 300 m (1000 ft) altitude, often together with Leucadendron pubescens and several large, tufted Restionaceae, such as Willdenowia. It occurs only in loose, very often stabilised Tertiary or Quaternary drift sands. The average annual precipitation in this area is 380‚Äì500 mm (15‚Äì20 in), mainly falling during the winter half year. The species is pollinated by insects, such as honey bees, monkey beetle), skippers, and also visited by birds like the Cape sugarbird, orange-breasted sunbird, and Cape weaver. The ripe fruits fall to the ground about two months after flowering, where these are collected by native ants, that carry them to their nests. Here they remain underground, safe for fire, seed-eating rondents and birds, until an overhead fire clears the vegetation and triggers the seeds to germinate.  Conservation  The sandveld pincushion is considered a vulnerable species because its population has decreased by at least 30% in the last 60 years, due to habitat loss through agricultural expansion and groundwater extraction.

France entered World War I when, after mobilizing on 1 August, its government declared war on Austria- Hungary on 11 August 1914. World War I largely arose from a conflict between two alliances: the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, and the Triple Entente of France, Russia and Britain. France had had a military alliance with Russia since 1894, designed primarily to neutralize the German threat to both countries. Germany had a military alliance with . In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated. The government of Austria-Hungary decided to destroy Serbia once and for all for stirring up trouble among ethnic Slavs. Germany secretly gave Austria-Hungary a blank check, promising to support it militarily no matter what it decided. Both countries wanted a localized war, Austria-Hungary versus Serbia. Russia decided to intervene to protect Serbia, a small fellow Slavic nation, despite there being no treaty requiring Russia to do so. The Tsar had the support of the President of France, who otherwise was hardly involved. Russia mobilized its army against Austria-Hungary. France mobilized its army. Germany declared war on Russia and France, and invaded France through Belgium. Britain had an understanding and military and naval planning agreements with France, but no formal treaty obligations. Britain did have a treaty obligation toward Belgium, and as a result Britain joined France and Russia (the Allies) and declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Japan, allied with Britain, joined the Allies. The Ottoman Empire (Turkey) joined the Central Powers. Italy, instead of joining Germany and Austria-Hungary with whom it had treaties, entered the war on the side of the Allies in 1915. The United States tried unsuccessfully to broker peace negotiations, and entered the war on the Allied side in April 1917. After very heavy losses on both sides, the Allies were decisively victorious, and divided the spoils of victory, such as the German colonies and much of the territory of the Ottoman Empire. The Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian and Ottoman Empires disintegrated.For a short overview see David Fromkin, Europe's Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914? (2004). Diplomatic background By the late 1880s Bismarck's League of the Three Emperors was in disarray. Germany remained closely allied to Austria-Hungary (since 1879) but there was growing friction between Russia and Austria-Hungary. Bismarck, in the hope of making the Tsar more amenable to his wishes, had forbidden German banks to lend money to Russia. French bankers quickly replaced the Germans in financing Russia, and helped to speed Russian industrialisation. The Russians had borrowed around 500 million francs by 1888. Bismarck signed a Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887, but after Bismarck's fall from power in 1890 Kaiser William II refused Russia's request to renew it. The advantage of a Franco-Russian alliance was clear to all Frenchmen: France would not be alone against Germany, for it promised a two-front war. Formal visits were exchanged between the two powers in 1890 and 1891, and the Russian Tsar saluted the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The Franco-Russian alliance was announced in 1894. This diplomatic coup was followed by a secret agreement with Italy, allowing the Italians a free hand to expand in Tripoli (modern Libya, then still under Turkish rule). In return, Italy promised she would remain non- belligerent against France in any future war. Meanwhile, as Britain became increasingly anxious over the German naval buildup and industrial rivalry, agreement with France became increasingly attractive. France competed with Britain, and to a lesser extent with Italy, for control of Africa. There was constant friction between Britain and France over borders between their respective African colonies (see the Fashoda Incident). The French Foreign Minister Th√©ophile Delcass√© was aware that France could not progress if she was in conflict with Germany in Europe and Britain in Africa, and so recalled Captain Marchand's expeditionary force from Fashoda, despite popular protests. This paved the way for Britain joining France in World War I. Edward VII's visit to Paris in 1903 stilled anti-British feeling in France, and prepared the way for the Entente Cordiale. Initially however, a colonial agreement against the Kaiser's aggressive foreign policy deepened rather than destroyed the bond between the two countries. The Moroccan Crises of 1905 and 1911 encouraged both countries to embark on a series of secret military negotiations in the case of war with Germany. However, British Foreign Minister Edward Grey realized the risk that small conflicts between Paris and Berlin could escalate out of control. Working with little supervision from the British Prime Minister or Cabinet, Grey deliberately played a mediating role, trying to calm both sides and thereby maintain a peaceful balance of power. He refused to make permanent commitments to France. He approved military staff talks with France in 1905, thereby suggesting, but not promising, that if war broke out Britain would favour France over Germany. In 1911, when there was a second Franco-German clash over Morocco, Grey tried to moderate the French while supporting Germany in its demand for compensation. There was little risk that Britain would have conflicts with anyone leading to war. The Royal Navy remained dominant in world affairs, and remained a high spending priority for the British government. The British Army was small, although plans to send an expeditionary force to France had been developed since the Haldane Reforms. From 1907 through 1914, the French and British armies collaborated on highly detailed plans for mobilizing a British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 combat troops to be very quickly moved to France, and sent to the front in less than two weeks.Samuel R. Williamson, Jr., The Politics of Grand Strategy: France and Britain Prepare for War, 1904-1914.\\" (1969) pp 313-17.. Grey insisted that world peace was in the best interests of Britain and the British Empire.Thomas G. Otte, \\"'Almost a law of nature'? Sir Edward Grey, the foreign office, and the balance of power in Europe, 1905-12.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 14.2 (2003): 77-118. France could strengthen its position in the event of war by forming new alliances or by enlisting more young men. It used both methods.James D. Morrow, \\"Arms versus Allies: Trade-offs in the Search for Security.\\" International Organization 47.2 (1993): 207-233. online Russia was firmly in the same camp, and Britain was almost ready to join. In 1913 the controversial \\"three year law\\" extended the term of conscription for French draftees from two to three years. Previously young men were in training at ages 21 and 22 then joined the reserves; now they were in training at ages 20, 21, and 22.Gerd Krumeich, Armaments and Politics in France on the Eve of the First World War: The Introduction of Three-Year Conscription, 1913-1914 (1985). When the war began in 1914, France could only win if Britain joined with France and Russia to stop Germany. There was no binding treaty between Britain and France, and no moral commitment on the British part to go to war on France's behalf. The Liberal government of Britain was pacifistic, and also extremely legalistic, so that German violation of Belgium neutrality ‚Äì treating it like a scrap of paper ‚Äì helped mobilize party members to support the war effort. The decisive factors were twofold, Britain felt a sense of obligation to defend France, and the Liberal Government realized that unless it did so, it would collapse either into a coalition, or yield control to the more militaristic Conservative Party. Either option would likely ruin the Liberal Party. When the German army invaded Belgium, not only was neutrality violated, but France was threatened with defeat, so the British government went to war.Trevor Wilson, \\"Britain's ‚ÄòMoral Commitment‚Äô to France in August 1914.\\" History 64.212 (1979): 380-390. online Mounting international tensions and the arms race led to the need to increase conscription from two to three years. Socialists, led by Jean Jaur√®s, deeply believed that war was a capitalist plot and could never be beneficial to the working man. They worked hard to defeat the conscription proposal, often in cooperation with middle- class pacifists and women's groups, but were outvoted.David M. Rowe, \\"Globalization, conscription, and anti-militarism in pre-World War I Europe.\\" in Lars Mjoset and Stephen Van Holde, eds. The Comparative Study of Conscription in the Armed Forces (Emerald Group, 2002) pp. 145-170. =Attitudes toward Germany= German troops parade down the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris after their victory in the Franco-Prussian War The critical issue for France was its relationship with Germany. Paris had relatively little involvement in the Balkan crisis that launched the war, paying little attention to Serbia, Austria or the Ottoman Empire. However, a series of unpleasant diplomatic confrontations with Germany soured relationships. The defeat in 1870-71 rankled, especially the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Although the issue of Alsace-Lorraine faded in importance after 1880, the rapid growth in the population and economy of Germany left France increasingly far behind. It was obvious that Germany could field more soldiers and build more heavy weapons. In the 1890s relationships remained good since Germany supported France during its difficulties with Britain over African colonies. Any lingering harmony, however, collapsed in 1905 by Germany taking an aggressively hostile position on French claims to Morocco. There was talk of war, and France strengthened its ties with Britain and Russia.J.F.V. Keiger, France and the World since 1870 (2001) pp 112-17. Even critics of French imperialism, such as Georges Clemenceau, had become impatient with Berlin. Raymond Poincar√©'s speeches as Prime Minister in 1912, and then as president in 1913‚Äì14, were similarly firm and drew widespread support across the political spectrum. Only the socialists were holdouts, warning that war was a capitalist ploy and should be avoided by the working class. In July 1914, socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s obtained a vote against war from the French Socialist Party Congress. 1,690 delegates supported a general strike against the war if the German socialists followed suit, with 1,174 opposed. However Jaur√®s was assassinated on 31 July, and the socialist parties in both France and Germany ‚Äì as well as most other countries ‚Äì strongly supported their national war effort in the first year.Barbara W. Tuchman, \\"The Death of Jaur√®s\\", chapter 8 of The Proud Tower - A portrait of the world before the War: 1890-1914 (1966) pp. 451-515. Main players Poincar√© elected president in 1913. As in all the major powers, a handful of men made the critical decisions in the summer of 1914.T.G. Otte, July Crisis: The world's descent into war, summer 1914 (2014) pp xvii-xxii. As the French ambassador to Germany from 1907 to 1914, Jules Cambon worked hard to secure a friendly d√©tente. He was frustrated by French leaders such as Raymond Poincar√©, who decided Berlin was trying to weaken the Triple Entente of France, Russia and Britain, and was not sincere in seeking peace. Apart from Cambron the French leadership believed that war was inevitable.John Keiger, \\"Jules Cambon and Franco-German D√©tente, 1907‚Äì1914.\\" The Historical Journal 26.3 (1983): 641-659. President Raymond Poincar√© was the most important decision maker, a highly skilled lawyer with a dominant personality and a hatred for Germany. He increasingly took charge of foreign affairs, but often was indecisive. Ren√© Viviani became Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in spring 1914. He was a cautious moderate but was profoundly ignorant of foreign affairs and baffled by what was going on. The main decisions were made by the foreign office and increasingly by the president. The ambassador to Russia, Maurice Pal√©ologue, hated Germany and reassured Russia that France would fight alongside it against Germany.William A. Renzi, \\"Who Composed 'Sazonov's Thirteen Points'? A Re-Examination of Russia's War Aims of 1914.\\" American Historical Review 88.2 (1983): 347-357. online. The central policy goal for Poincar√© was maintaining the close alliance with Russia, which he achieved by a week-long visit to St. Petersburg in mid-July 1914. French and German leaders were closely watching the rapid rise in Russian military and economic power and capability. For the Germans, that deepened the worry often expressed by the Kaiser that Germany was being surrounded by enemies whose power was growing. One implication was that time was against them, and a war soon would be more advantageous for Germany than war later. For the French, there was a growing fear that Russia would become significantly more powerful than France and become more independent of France, possibly even returning to its old military alliance with Germany. The implication was that a war sooner could count on the Russian alliance, but the longer it waited, the greater the likelihood of a Russian alliance with Germany that would doom France.Otte, July Crisis (2014) pp 99, 135-36. July crisis On 28 June 1914, the world was surprised, but not especially alarmed, by news of the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.David Fromkin, Europe's Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914? (2004) p. 138. The July crisis began on 23 July 1914 with the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, containing brutal terms intended to inspire rejection. The crisis was caused not by the assassination but rather by the decision in Vienna to use it as a pretext for a war with Serbia that many in the Austrian and Hungarian governments had long advocated.Fromkin, p. 264. A year before, it had been planned that French President Raymond Poincar√© would visit St Petersburg in July 1914 to meet Tsar Nicholas II. The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold, decided that it was too dangerous for Austria- Hungary to present the ultimatum while the Franco-Russian summit was in progress. He decided to wait until Poincar√© was on board the battleship that would take him home so that he could not easily co-ordinate with Russia.Fromkin, pp 168-169. At the time of the St Petersburg summit, there were rumours but little hard evidence that Vienna might use the assassination to start a war with Serbia. War did not appear imminent when President Poincar√© and his new Prime Minister Ren√© Viviani departed by ship for St Petersburg on 15 July, arrived on 20 July and departed for home on 23 July. The meetings were centrally concerned with the crisis unfolding in central Europe. Although Viviani was also foreign minister, he was unfamiliar with foreign affairs and said little. Poincar√© was fully in charge of the French side of the discussions. Throughout the visit, he was aggressively hostile toward Germany and cared little for Serbia or Austria.Sidney Fay, Origins of the World War (1934) 2:277-86.Sean McMeekin, July 1914 (2014) pp 145-76 covers the visit day-by-day. The French and the Russians agreed that their alliance extended to supporting Serbia against Austria, confirming the already- established policy behind the Balkan inception scenario. As Christopher Clark noted, \\"Poincar√© had come to preach the gospel of firmness and his words had fallen on ready ears. Firmness in this context meant an intransigent opposition to any Austrian measure against Serbia. At no point do the sources suggest that Poincar√© or his Russian interlocutors gave any thought whatsoever to what measures Austria-Hungary might legitimately be entitled to take in the aftermath of the assassinations\\".Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers (2012) pp. 449‚Äì50. Vienna and Berlin both wanted to keep the confrontation localised to the Balkans so that Austria would be the only major power involved. They neglected to negotiate on that point and indeed systematically deceived the potential adversaries. Thus, the delivery of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia was deliberately scheduled for a few hours after the departure of the French delegation from Russia on 23 July so that France and Russia could not co- ordinate their responses. There was a false assumption that if France were kept in the dark, it would still have a moderating influence and thus localise the war.John F. V. Keiger, France and the origins of the First World War (1983) pp 156-57. Just the opposite took place: without co-ordination, Russia assumed it had France's full support and so Austria sabotaged its own hopes for localisation. In St Petersburg, most Russian leaders sensed that their national strength was gaining on Germany and Austria and so it would be prudent to wait until they were stronger. However, they decided that Russia would lose prestige and forfeit its chance to take a strong leadership role in the Balkans. They might be stronger in a future confrontation, but at present they had France as an ally, and the future was unpredictable. Thus, Tsar Nicholas II decided to mobilize on the southwestern flank against Austria to deter Vienna from an invasion of Serbia.Jack S. Levy, and William Mulligan, \\"Shifting power, preventive logic, and the response of the target: Germany, Russia, and the First World War.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 40.5 (2017): 731-769. Christopher Clark stated, \\"The Russian general mobilisation [of 30 July] was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis. This was the first of the general mobilisations. It came at the moment when the German government had not yet even declared the State of Impending War\\".Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2013). p 509. Germany now felt threatened and responded with her own mobilisation and declaration of war on 1 August 1914.W. Bruce Lincoln, Passage Through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution, 1914‚Äì1918 (1986) All of those decisive moves and countermoves took place while Poincar√© was slowly returning to Paris on board a battleship. Poincar√©'s attempts while afloat to communicate with Paris were blocked by the Germans, who jammed the radio messages between his ship and Paris.Fromkin, p. 194. When Vienna's ultimatum was presented to Serbia on 23 July, the French government was in the hands of Acting Premier Jean- Baptiste Bienvenu-Martin, the Minister of Justice, who was unfamiliar with foreign affairs. His inability to take decisions especially exasperated the Quai d'Orsay (the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Senior diplomat Philippe Berthelot complained that France was doing nothing while Europe was threatened with the prospect of war.Fromkin, p 190. Realising that Poincar√© was practically incommunicado, the French military command began issuing orders in preparation for its own mobilization in defense against Germany, and it ordered French troops to withdraw from the German border not avoid being provocative. The French war plan called for an immediate invasion of Alsace- Lorraine and never expected that the main German attack would come immediately and come far to the north, through neutral Belgium.Keiger, France and the origins of the First World War (1983) pp 152-54. France and Russia agreed that there must not be an ultimatum. On 21 July, the Russian Foreign Minister warned the German ambassador to Russia, \\"Russia would not be able to tolerate Austria-Hungary's using threatening language to Serbia or taking military measures\\". The leaders in Berlin discounted that threat of war and failed to pass on the message to Vienna for a week. German Foreign Minister Gottlieb von Jagow noted that \\"there is certain to be some blustering in St Petersburg\\". German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg told his assistant that Britain and France did not realize that Germany would go to war if Russia mobilized. He thought London saw a German \\"bluff\\" and was responding with a \\"counterbluff\\".Konrad Jarausch, \\"The Illusion of Limited War: Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's Calculated Risk, July 1914\\" Central European History (1969) 2#1 pp 48-76. online Political scientist James Fearon argued from this episode that the Germans believed Russia to be expressing greater verbal support for Serbia than it would actually provide to pressure Germany and Austria-Hungary to accept some Russian demands in negotiation. Meanwhile, Berlin was downplaying its actual strong support for Vienna to avoid appearing the aggressor, which would alienate German socialists. France's passive role France played only a small largely passive role in the diplomatic crisis of July 1914. Its top leaders were out of the country and mostly out of contact with breaking reports from July 15 to July 29, when most of the critical decisions were taken.John F. V. Keiger, France and the origins of the First World War (1983) pp 146-154.T. G. Otte, July Crisis: The World's Descent into War, Summer 1914 (2014). pp 198-209. Austria and Germany deliberately acted to prevent the French and Russian leadership from communicating during the last week in July. But this made little difference as French policy in strong support of Russia had been locked in. Germany realized that a war with Russia meant a war with France, and so its war plans called for an immediate attack on France ‚Äì through Belgium ‚Äì hoping for a quick victory before the slow- moving Russians could become a factor. France was a major military and diplomatic player before and after the July crisis, and every power paid close attention to its role. Historian Joachim Remak says: : The nation that...can still be held least responsible for the outbreak of the war is France. This is so even if we bear in mind all the revisions of historical judgments, and all the revisions of these revisions, to which we have now been treated....The French, in 1914, entered the war because they had no alternative. The Germans had attacked them. History can be very simple at times.Joachim Remak, \\"1914-- The Third Balkan War: Origins Reconsidered.\\" Journal of Modern History 43.3 (1971): 354-366 at pp 354-55.

The colours of the club are red and blue.  Club History  Football in the Victorian town of Hepburn Springs dates back to the 1860s and a team was fielded in 1864 but it wasn't until approximately 1919, after World War I, that the Hepburn Football Club was officially founded and represented the town in an organised competition. Hepburn played in the Daylesford District Junior Football Association in which the Burras compiled a successful history, claiming premierships in 1930, 1934, 1938 and 1939. After World War II, Hepburn moved to the Clunes Football Association and was rather unsuccessful in the league, the closest to adding to the flag haul was the 1949 grand final, losing to the Newlyn Football Club by 31 points. In 1979, the Clunes Football League and the Ballarat Bacchus Marsh Football League amalgamated to form the Central Highlands Football League and Hepburn were one of the founding members of the new competition. After first contesting the finals in 1985, the Burras improved and went on to win a CHFL record-breaking nine senior premierships, the most recent being in 2017 at Mars Stadium when they beat minor premiers Beaufort 15.15.105 to 13.9.87.

She was the wife of George Grenville, Prime Minister from 1763 to 1765; the daughter of Sir William Wyndham, a prominent Tory politician; and the mother of William Grenville, Prime Minister from 1806 to 1807. Early life She was born Elizabeth Wyndham in 1719 to Sir William Wyndham and his first wife, Lady Catherine Seymour, the daughter of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. She was baptised on 31 January 1719 in Westminster and had two older brothers, Charles and Percy. Her father was a prominent politician in the 1710s and 1720s, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the Tories. Wyndham's mother, Catherine, died in 1731 and William remarried in 1734 to Maria Catherina de Jonge. Wyndham suffered from smallpox when she was young, which left scarring on her face. Writing and art Wyndham kept a book of newspaper cuttings, mostly relating to political subjects, and kept a diary of her husband's political career. She was also an amateur artist and produced several pastel works, including a self-portrait that was sold as part of the Stowe House sale of 1848. Marriage and family On 16 May 1749, Wyndham married George Grenville, then a Lord of the Treasury and an MP for Buckingham. Her grandfather, the Duke of Somerset, did not approve of the marriage and left Wyndham only a small amount of money in his will. The couple took over the running of Wotton House in Buckinghamshire, where they raised their eight children: * Richard Grenville (died 1759); died young * George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham (17 June 1753 ‚Äì 11 February 1813); father of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos * Charlotte Grenville ( ‚Äì 29 September 1830); married Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet (1749‚Äì1789) on 21 December 1771, and had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood * Thomas Grenville (31 December 1755 ‚Äì 17 December 1846), MP and bibliophile, died unmarried * Elizabeth Grenville (24 October 1756 ‚Äì 21 December 1842); married (as his second wife) John Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort (1751‚Äì1828), on 12 April 1787, and had three daughters * William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville (25 October 1759 ‚Äì 12 January 1834); later Prime Minister * Catherine Grenville (1761 ‚Äì 6 November 1796); married Richard Neville-Aldworth (1750‚Äì1825), afterwards Richard Griffin, 2nd Baron Braybrooke, on 19 June 1780, and had four children. * Hester Grenville (before 1767 ‚Äì 13 November 1847); married Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue, on 10 May 1782 and had nine children In 1763 George Grenville became Prime Minister.

It was built during 1871 and is also known as Curan Curan, Carrum Carrum, Subiaco and Vienna Cottage. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= =History of Hunters Hill= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011 Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, 15. In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry 1989, 48. Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest garden suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members.Mattingley, 2007. =Vienna= Vienna was built in 1871 for John Jacob Hellman (later Hillman) and his Irish wife Ann. He originally came from Hamburg, Germany and his wife Ann (n√©e O'Donnell) from Mooneenreave, County Leitrim, Ireland. Ann came to Australia in 1857 as a bounty migrant. They were married in 1860, and purchased what is now 36 to 40 Alexandra Street from Herman Heinrich Groth for A¬£60 on 19 November 1866. This land formed lots 11 and 12 of a Jules Joubert subdivision of 1859. The area was originally owned by John Roby Hatfield by crown grant dated 12 July 1839. John Jacob Hellman was a shoemaker by occupation. In the 1870s he had a shop at 171/2 Erskine Street, City and later worked as a shoemaker to St. Joseph's College. He and his wife owned cattle and ran a dairy and orchard and in the early 1880s he was also the lamp lighter of the Borough of Hunter's Hill. There were six children, all except the first were baptised at the Villa Maria Church, Hunters Hill as Hillman, not Hellman. Their second son Hugh (born 8.7.1870) was enrolled as a boarder at St. Joseph's College on the first day (18.7.1881) that the College began at Hunter's Hill. The cottage 'Redleaf (36 Alexandra Street) was also owned by the Hellmans and after the death of his wife Arm (5.8.1908), John Jacoh and his youngest son James Frederick (born 9.6.1873) moved in 1912 from Vienna into that weatherboard cottage. At that time his son Hugh was the owner occupier of Alroy (34 Alexandra Street) and his married daughter Mary King (born 19.8.1867) and her children lived in Vienna. After the death of his father, James Frederick, who was a tailor by occupation, became the owner of both Vienna and Redleaf and continued to live in Redleaf until 1923. During the 1920s he made some changes to Vienna including the insertion of side windows to allow more light into the rooms. Mary King left Vienna in 1923 and another of John Jacob's sons, John Hillman (born 15.5.1865) lived there until 1926. A number of tenants then occupied the cottage, the Anderson family since 1941, George Anderson being the tenant in 1983. James Frederick never married and after his death in 1958 the cottage passed to one of his nieces, Gladys Hillman who is still the owner. Vienna was known from its construction in 1871 up until the 1920s as Carrum Carrum. When occupied by John Hillman Jnr. in 1924 it was called Subiaco but since the 1930s its name has been Vienna. The adjoining land (40 Alexandra Street), being part of Lot 12 of the original Joubert subdivision of 1859, has never been built upon. It was for many years an orchard having a variety of trees bearing oranges, mandarins, lemons, plums, quinces, pomegranates and guavas. The land has always been an integral part of Vienna. It also contains the old well which is now covered over. In 1984 Vienna Cottage was purchased by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) with funding from the local Vienna Appeal Committee.Le Seuer, 2015, 7  Description  Vienna is a four-roomed stone gabled roofed cottage with front and back verandahs on a rectangular suburban block with small front garden and long rear garden, with remnant orchard.Stuart Read, 15/8/8 The adjoining land (40 Alexandra Street), being part of Lot 12 of the original Joubert subdivision of 1859, has never been built upon.

It also contains the old well which is now covered over. The roof is slated and the doors are four panelled. The shuttered windows at the front of the house are pleate galss while those at the back at\\\\re small paned with crown glass. The house retains its early Victorian style timber chimneypieces and in the front rooms are pretty circular ceiling roses, which is the only elaboration of the plasterwork. Behind the house is a weatherboard service block, with an iron roof and stone chimney. This is linked to the main house by a simple covered way across a narrow flagged court. = Condition = As at 3 March 2000, the physical condition was good. = Modifications and dates = *1920s - windows put in side walls to allow more light into the rooms. *2007-8: garden restoration completed, including ornaments, pots, implements, fence repair, installing new gate and security device.  Heritage listing  As at 2 January 2013, Vienna was an excellent example of a tradesman's cottage of the nineteenth century, complete with its detached kitchen block. It intactness makes it rare in Sydney. It is evidence of the period 1861 - 1890 when Hunter's Hill first developed as a suburb and it stands on the earliest successful small lot subdivision in the village. The subdivision was undertaken by Jules Joubert who with his brother Didier were together the first, and most prominent developers of Hunter's Hill. The cottage demonstrates the tradesman's way of life of the 19th century, and how the family adapted the cottage to accommodate changing needs and standards. Vienna was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The un- built upon land, once an orchard, is rare evidence of the reliance of suburban families in the 19th and early 20th century on home produce, and is a significant feature of the property. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Vienna combined with the adjoining Hillman cottages of Alroy and Redleaf demonstrate the once common pattern of family property ownership, and the later resubdivision of the land demonstrates, in microcosm, the speculative nature of land ownership in Hunter's Hill. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cottage has considerable educational value. The cottage demonstrates the tradesman's way of life of the 19th century, and how the family adapted the cottage to accommondate changing needs and standards. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Its intactness makes it rare in Sydney.

The site is a scheduled monument and is one of only a few souterrains open to the public. Structure Interior of Finnis souterrain showing the dry stone walls and flat stone roof.The site is made up of a long main passage that runs east to west, with two long side passages on the right hand side that open into small chambers. All three passages are approximately wide. The first of the main passage is approximately 1 meter high, there is then a low lintel structure after which the passage continues at approximately in height in a slight downward curve. The walls are granite and were constructed using a dry stone method. The roof consists of flat stone lintels that span between the walls. The current entrance is not in the original location, which is unknown. It is also unknown when the current entrance was created, but it dates to at least 1833 when an iron door was installed by the parish rector. It is thought that the main passage may have continued further east of the present day entrance. A description from 1836 mentions stone steps which have not been found. History The souterrain was first built in the 9th century and records of it date to the early 18th century. Although the exact purpose of souterrains has been debated, it is thought that they were used as a refuge from raiders or invaders, or a place to store religious artefacts. As souterrains are dry and cold places, they may have also been used to store food. In 1977 the site was cleared and surveyed by archaeologists but no formal excavation took place. Work to restore the site and open it to the public later began after collaboration between the land owner and Banbridge District Council. Funding for this was provided by the Mourne Heritage Trust, and the Environment and heritage Service and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Soil that had built up inside was removed, some minor repairs were made, stone chippings were used to cover the floor, solar lights were placed along the walls of the passageways and the iron door was replaced. A fenced pathway along the edge of the field was also built and an information board was placed next to the entrance. Work was completed and it was opened to the public in July 2003.

It contains songs that were under consideration for Harrison's triple album All Things Must Pass, his first release as a solo artist following the break-up of the Beatles. The performances were taped in a single session at Abbey Road Studios in London, on 27 May 1970, for the benefit of Harrison's co-producer, Phil Spector. Seven of the fifteen songs were subsequently recorded formally for inclusion on All Things Must Pass, as was \\"Everybody, Nobody\\" after Harrison reworked it as \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\". The bootleg provides the only available record of five songs that Harrison never revisited during his career. Among these is a 1968 collaboration with Bob Dylan titled \\"Nowhere to Go\\". Harrison sings and performs on acoustic and electric guitar throughout, with an unnamed bass player on \\"Wah-Wah\\" providing the only extra accompaniment. The album title derives from Harrison's performance of \\"Beware of Darkness\\", where he altered a line to mention Allen Klein's management company ABKCO. Three recordings from the collection were later issued on official releases. These were \\"Beware of Darkness\\" and \\"Let It Down\\", both of which Harrison included as bonus tracks on the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass (with lead guitar and keyboard overdubs added to \\"Let It Down\\"); and \\"Run of the Mill\\", which appears on the 2012 outtakes and demos compilation Early Takes: Volume 1. Recording Harrison recorded the tape that subsequently became the Beware of ABKCO! bootleg at Abbey Road Studios in London, early on in the sessions for All Things Must Pass. By this time, in May 1970, he had amassed a large stockpile of songs since his level of contribution as a songwriter in the Beatles was always limited by the dominance of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Harrison ran through a selection of his unused songs for the benefit of Phil Spector, his co-producer on All Things Must Pass, with a view to choosing which ones they would work on for the album. In his liner notes to the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass, Harrison gives the recording date as 27 May. He also writes that he was not aware that his performances were being taped. When promoting the reissue, Harrison recalled that an engineer happened to set up a microphone and record him. The songs are all solo performances by Harrison, except for bass guitar accompaniment on \\"Wah-Wah\\". He plays acoustic guitar on the majority of the tracks, changing to electric guitar for three songs: \\"Wah-Wah\\", \\"Hear Me Lord\\" and \\"Nowhere to Go\\". The performances heighten the folk aspect of Harrison's songwriting and contrast with the large-scale arrangements and Wall of Sound production employed on much of the official album. Harrison gives a brief spoken introduction before several of the songs, during which he occasionally acknowledges when the lyrics are still incomplete. Musical content =Songs officially released by Harrison= Seven of the fifteen tracks were subsequently recorded for All Things Must Pass. In addition, soon after performing it on 27 May, Harrison incorporated \\"Everybody, Nobody\\" into a new song, \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\", which he also included on the official release. Two of the remaining tracks were songs that Harrison returned to later in his solo career. \\"Beautiful Girl\\" appeared on the 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3, and the Bob Dylan-written \\"I Don't Want to Do It\\" became Harrison's contribution to the soundtrack for Porky's Revenge! in 1985. In the case of the latter song, this was despite Harrison telling Spector on the tape that he intended to record the track at the session the following day. =Songs exclusive to the album= \\"Window, Window\\" One of several Harrison compositions presented to the Beatles in January 1969, during the sessions that produced their Let It Be album and film, but rejected by the group. Harrison debuted the song at Apple Studio on 21 January, his first day of work since walking out on the band eleven days before. The group briefly rehearsed it on 26 January, until McCartney took over the singing and ensured it was no longer taken seriously. The song is in the folk style and is introduced by Harrison in his May 1970 performance as being \\"a bit silly\\". In his commentary on Beware of ABKCO!, music critic Richie Unterberger describes \\"Window, Window\\" as a \\"lilting, troubadourish ballad\\". \\"Nowhere to Go\\" A second Harrison‚ÄìDylan collaboration from November 1968, after \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\", which Harrison chose as the opening track of All Things Must Pass. \\"Nowhere to Go\\" was originally known as \\"When Everybody Comes to Town\\". Harrison recorded a demo of the song at Dylan's house in Greenwich Village in late April 1970. In the lyrics, Harrison comments on his drug bust, in March 1969, and life as a Beatle. \\"Cosmic Empire\\" Theologian Dale Allison describes \\"Cosmic Empire\\" as a \\"happy song\\" that \\"obviously expresses a religious worldview and sets forth a religious goal\\" although the lyrics are \\"cryptic\\". Unterberger describes it as \\"buoyant, jaunty\\" and says that it demonstrates Harrison's sense of humour. At the start of the performance, Harrison announces that he envisions the song \\"full of chorus voices\\". \\"Mother Divine\\" Olivia Harrison says she came across the lyrics to \\"Mother Divine\\" when compiling the 2017 revised edition of her late husband's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, and that they suggest Harrison wrote the song while in India in the late 1960s. The song has a medium tempo and its meaning invites interpretation as being about a woman as well as a deity ‚Äì a style of songwriting that Harrison introduced in 1968 with \\"Long, Long, Long\\" and would return to frequently as a solo artist. It consists of frequent repetition of the chorus; in the first of its two verses, Harrison sings: \\"Haloed in splendour / Her face, tenderly smiling too / Was beauty itself / And I know that she loves me.\\" Olivia has also said of the song: \\"It's a lovely sentiment, and something he did sing over the years, maybe as a mantra.\\" \\"Tell Me What Has Happened to You\\" In Unterberger's description, the song contains an \\"ominous ascending riff\\" and sections set in a more standard folk style.

Birth Bakht-un-Nissa Begum was born in 1547 in Badakhshan. Her mother was Mah Chuchak Begum. On the night of her birth Humayun had a dream, and it occurred to him that she be named 'Bakht-un-Nissa'. Her siblings included, Mirza Muhammad Hakim, Farrukh Fal Mirza, Sakina Banu Begum, and Amina Banu Begum. Marriages =Shah Abdul Ma'ali= During Mah Chuchak Begum's rule at Kabul, Shah Abdul Ma'ali, who belonged to the family of the great Sayyids of Termez, who had escaped from the prison at Lahore, arrived at Kabul and approached her for refuge. The Begum welcomed him, was generous to him and gave her daughter Bakht-un-Nissa Begum in marriage with him. However, soon Abdul Ma'ali grew tired of the dominating and interfering ways of Mah Chuchak Begum. He wanted Kabul for himself. So he killed the Begum 1564. Hakim Mirza was luckily rescued by Sulaiman Mirza of Badakshan, who defeated and killed Abdul Ma'ali and helped Mirza Hakim to keep his hold over Kabul. =Khawaja Hasan= After Abdul Ma'ali's death, Hakim Mirza married her to Khawaja Hasan Naqshbandi of Badakshan. With Hasan, she had two sons, Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman and Mirza Wali. After Hakim Mirza's death, Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman fled to Transoxania, where he died in exile. The begum, and her son Mirza Wali joined the court, and Akbar did much to please her. In 1619, Jahangir married Mirza Wali to Bulaqi Begum, the daughter of Prince Daniyal Mirza, the son of Akbar. Governorship of Kabul Her brother, Hakim Mirza was the governor of Kabul. In 1581, he rebelled in Kabul, and advanced to Lahore invading Punjab on the way. Here he was checked by Man Singh, who was the governor of Punjab at that time. Akbar declared war on him and himself went to Kabul. Mirza Hakim went to the hills. Akbar pardoned him, but the governorship of Kabul was now given to Bakht-un-Nissa Begum. Akbar also promised not to show any kindness to Hakim if he misbehaved in future. After Akbar's return from Kabul, Hakim got his old position, but all the official orders were issued in Bakht-un-Nissa's name. Death Bakht-un-Nissa Begum died of consumption and hectic fever on 1 June 1608.

The age on onset is also variable ranging from the first week of life to 29 years.Zheng C, Huang Y, Ye Z, Wang Y, Tang Z, Lu J, Wu J, Zhou Y, Wang L, Huang Z, Yang H, Xue A (2018) Infantile onset intractable inflammatory bowel disease due to novel heterozygous mutations in TNFAIP3 (A20). Inflamm Bowel Dis doi: 10.1093/ibd/izy165 The male:female ratio is 1:3. Genetics The TNFAIP3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q23.3). Inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. It appears that two copies of this gene are required to avoid inflammatory features developing - hence the name haploinsufficiency. Pathogenesis The gene encodes a protein - Tumor necrosis factor alpha- induced protein 3 - which inhibits the pro inflammatory actions of NF-Œ∫B. The protein encoded has both ubiquitin ligation deubiquitinase activities and forms part of the ubiquitin editing protein complex. It is involved in several biochemical pathways the details of which are still under investigation. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by sequencing the TNFAIP3 gene. The usual laboratory tests are consistent with non-specific inflammation. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies may be positive. Biopsies show non specific inflammatory changes. =Differential diagnosis= The main differential diagnosis are Beh√ßet's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment Response to colchicine has been variable. Cytokine inhibitors - including the anti-IL6 receptor biologic tocilizumab - appear to be the most effective.

It was built from 1861 to 1862 by John Cuneo. It is also known as Garibaldi, The and The Garibaldi Inn. The property is owned by Garibaldi Inn (Private). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011 =History of Hunters Hill= Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, 15. In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry 1989, 48. Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members.Mattingley, 2007. =Garibaldi Inn= The Garibaldi Inn was built of the local golden sandstone by John Cuneo (who came from Genoa, Italy in 1854) during the 1860s as the suburb's first hotel. Hunter's Hill Rate Assessment Books indicate that it was unfinished in 1861, substantially completed by 1869 and that Cuneo continued to add rooms until 1881 when it was described as a \\"16 room hotel\\". The attic rooms were once used to house Italian stonemasons who were constructing buildings and residences in the area. John Cuneo was one of the indentured stonemasons brought out to New South Wales to build fine stone houses in the Hunters Hill area district by Count de Milhau and the Jobert Brothers. Cuneo also imported statues from Italy through his marble business until 1861. The building is named The Garibaldi Inn in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) a compatriot, military leader and national hero of the Italian people who fought for the liberation and unification of Italy. The Garibaldi also features a statue of a woman cupbearer in the niche above the door. The Cuneos wer shopkeepers, yachtsmen and had a jazz band. 'Cuneo's Corner' was the centre of the suburb's social activity and 'Cuneo's Recreation Ground' was on the opposite corner. The inn was run as a hotel until 1911 when it lost its licence. In the New South Wales State election of 1910, during an era of temperance fervour, a local option vote was taken on the question of reducing the number of hotels and Hunter's Hill (in the district of Lane Cove) voted for a reduction. This may relate to the fact that The Garibaldi ceased to be a hotel after 1911. By 1912 the building began to be rented as a shop by Mrs Nelly Rehm (confectioner) and continued as such under various tenants. Relative minor alterations were made to the building in 1911/12 when it was converted from an Inn to use as a shop. The Tanianes who were there from 1934 to 1976 and they bought the building from the Cuneo family in 1949. A fruit and vegetable shop was run from where the bar had been by Mr Peter and Miss Mary Taniane. The building gradually fell into neglect and in 1971 Amoco made a bid for the site with the intention of demolishing the building for a service station. At this time the conservation movement in Australia was well under way and the Hunter's Hill people were able to prevent the demolition of The Garibaldi. In 1973 the original statue of Hebe, the gods' female cupbearer was stolen. Following a community nomination a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the building on 16 October 1981. From the Tanianes, The Garibaldi passed to a succession of owners in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Attempts were made at the time to return the building to some kind of social purpose as in the days of John Cuneo. There were applications to develop it as a restaurant and then as an Inn. These applications were refused to due to the local community outcry. In 1983 The Garibaldi was bought by Barry Webb & Associates, a firm of consulting engineers for use as offices. With the approval of the State government and Hunter's Hill Council the remaining parts of the site were redeveloped with offices, shops and underground parking. On the 2 April 1999 The Garibaldi was transferred to the State Heritage Register.Heritage Branch files.  Description  The Garibaldi is prominently located on the corner of Alexandra Street and Ferry Street Hunters Hill. It is a fine and substantial two-storey sandstone building punctuated by eight pane sash windows and a slate roof. The corner is truncated with an entrance door and above is a niche with a statue of a woman cup bearer. Attic in roof. = Condition = As at 22 January 2013, the physical condition was excellent.  Heritage listing  As at 22 January 2013, The Garibaldi is of State heritage significance for its associations with John Cuneo an Italian stonemason who was brought to New South Wales by the Joubert brothers and the Count de Milhau to assist in developing the area. It is of historic significance for its close associations with the evolution of Hunters Hill and as the first Inn constructed in Hunters Hill. Constructed in The Garibaldi is of aesthetic significance as a fine and substantial two-storey structure of dressed sandstone with a slate roof. It is substantially intact and makes an important contribution to the streetscape. The Garibaldi was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

In 1983, she was arrested after one of her daughters-in-law told her lawyer that her mother-in-law had poisoned her two husbands. Following investigations by the police revealed that Velten had killed in about 20 years - from 1963 to 1982 - a total of five people: her father, an aunt, two husbands and a partner. She mixed parathion with bilberry pudding, as the color of the pudding covered the blue warning color of the poison. Therefore, she was referred to in the tabloid press as \\"Bilberry Mariechen\\" and \\"The Poison Witch from Lower Rhine\\".

It is also known as Weil Park and The Smelting Company. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Environment, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wallumettagal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs.Pitt, 2011 =Development of Hunters Hill= Captain John Hunter (1737‚Äì1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, 15 In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about 1 acres each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry 1989, 48, Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb. The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members.Mattingley, 2007. =Kelly's Bush= Kelly's Bush derives its name from Mr Thomas H. Kelly who owned over of land on the foreshore of Hunter's Hill (stretching from Woolwich Road south to the Parramatta River). This area was bounded by the Parramatta River, Woolwich Road, Nelson Parade and Alfred Street. He established the Smelting Company on of waterfront land in 1892, with the adjoining seventeen acres of bush to the north designed to act as a buffer to the residential areas and zoned \\"open space\\". The Smelting Company allowed public access to the foreshore for recreation, through all areas except the actual works area. The condition of the surrounding bush fluctuated, depending on the amount of timber being used to fire the smelters. Almost of the \\"open space\\" became known as Weil Park when it was purchased in 1956 by Hunter's Hill Council and the Cumberland County Council. The bush was cleared and a grassed oval created for sporting activities. In 1966 the Town Clerk wrote to the State Planning Authority stating: \\"There is insufficient area in the land held and known as Weil Park and Council feels that it is important to the interest of posterity that additional \\"open space\\" area should be acquired whilst the opportunity exists\\". In 1967 the Smelting Company works moved to Alexandria and A. V. Jennings took a two-year option to purchase the site. They applied to Council seeking suspension of the County of Cumberland Planning Scheme Ordinance to enable the development of 147 home units, including three buildings of eight- storeys high. Council was opposed to the application and renewed its bid for State acquisition of the entire area as open space, however the State Planning Authority rejected the proposal. Jennings subsequently submitted a series of modified applications. The Hunters Hill Trust strongly condemned the Jennings development. The SPA then arranged to buy from Jennings of sloping waterfront bush and abandoned industrial reserve for a \\"foreshore reserve\\". In 1969 the Council agreed in principle to a suspension of the existing zoning to permit the development of 56 townhouses (without any public consultation). This was subsequently reduced to 25 single dwelling allotments. In an article that appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald on 25 July 1970 local Hunters Hill resident Betty James wrote how local children had pulled up a long line of survey pegs laid out through \\"their bush\\" as a heartfelt protest. Her article read like a love-letter to Kelly's Bush, describing its deep gullies of bracken fern, its blueberry ash, lily-pilly, tea tree and a rare stand of healthy banksias. James...also talked about it as an outdoor laboratory and living museum: there were Aboriginal middens and carvings in the sandstone. In September 1970, James and 12 other neighbours gathered at All Saints' parish hall and christened themselves the 'Battlers for Kelly's Bush'. The group, which the Hunters Hill Council would dismiss as \\"13 bloody housewives\\", elected James as President, Kath Lehany as secretary and Monica Sheehan as assistant secretary. Most of the women were lifelong Liberal Party voters who had never been involved in politics but each had a different reason for joining...Miriam Cunningham...had realised when she had been to Australia Square, then Sydney's tallest building, that Kellys Bush was the only patch of green she could see on the Parramatta River. \\"It was the lungs of Sydney.\\".Pitt, 2011, 56 A group of concerned citizens had formed by this stage and called themselves \\"The Battlers\\". Unwittingly, the battlers set down a blueprint for the modern-day protest movement. They wrote hundreds of letters. They organised a \\"phone tree\\" to pass on news. They invited media to \\"boil the billy\\" days in the bush and plied them with baked goods. They ran essay competitions for schoolchildren about why the bush should be saved. They made badges and banners and got their teenagers to hang them around Hunters Hill. They enlisted the local school band, which marched form Hunters Hill High School to Kellys Bush, calling for \\"browsing not housing\\". They even roped in local Kylie Tennant to write protest poems. Dinner parties became battlegrounds and the peninsula community divided over the issue. Some wanted the sewage pipes that A.V.Jennings promised to build for the whole area or believed local state Liberal MP Peter Coleman, who said Council rares would drop when Jennings came...Over the course of several months, the battlers sent several delegations to the Liberal Premier of the day, Robert Askin, to argue their case. \\"Askin derided us as middle-class matrons\\" says Hunters Hill resident Phil Jenkyn, who says the women inspired him to form a group known as the Defenders of Sydney Harbour Foreshores. They met with the (then) Premier Robert Askin, asking him to intervene. The Battlers also wrote to the various unions asking for their support and were referred to the Trades and Labour Council. Despite the protest, in 1971 the Minister for Local Government signed the notice rezoning the land from Reserved Open Space to Residential. The President of the Builders Labourers' Federation of Australia (BLF) met with The Battlers and went to the BLF executive, who supported them in principle. The trade union support resulted in the first \\"black ban\\" called on 16 June 1971 by the BLF over an area of land. Black bans would later become known as \\"green ban\\" for their active pursuit of the maintenance of green space. Six hundred people attended a rally in August 1971 to demonstrate their support for Kelly's Bush. With the union green ban in force, A.V. Jennings were eventually forced to sell the land to Hunter's Hill Council, however, by a narrow margin the councillors voted to retain the Residential Zoning. In 1977 the new Premier, Neville Wran, announced that no development would take place at Kelly's Bush. The discovery of radioactive waste on the site raised serious doubts as to its suitability for residential development. A period of silence followed and then in 1983 Neville Wran announced that Kelly's Bush was to be set aside for full public access on a permanent basis. His press release read: \\"It represents a victory for environmentalists generally. The land will be used to give people access to natural bushland fronting Parramatta River.\\" The shape of modern Sydney is City of Sydney Labor councillor Meredith Burgmann, who wrote a book on the subject. The movement even inspired overseas activists, including German Petra Kelly, who would eventually form one of the world's first Green political parties. Mundey and the BLF went on to lead 42 green bans in the early 1970s, holding up billions of dollars worth of construction. It took the 13 women 13 years to save Kelly's Bush... When the Wran Government bought the land the women celebrated with a simple bush ceremony and a pot of tea - and invited Jack Mundey, by now their friend for life...Kids still build cubby houses here and roam by foot, bike or in their imagination among the banksias and bracken. Several of the seven dead battlers have had their ashes scattered in the bush....  Description  Kelly's Bush covers of bushland on the lower reaches of the Parramatta River in the Sydney Metropolitan Area. It is part of a network of near natural open spaces on the Sydney Harbour waterway system and is the only substantial area of natural bush on the lower Parramatta River. Kelly's Bush is the largest area of near natural bush on the Hunter's Hill peninsula. It is linked directly to Weil Park to the north, Nelson Parade and residential areas to the west, the Parramatta River to the south and residential areas and Woolwich Marina to the east. Kelly's Bush lies on the southerly aspect of the major ridge line of the Hunter's Hill Peninsula, which runs in an east-west direction. There are five major vegetation communities found in Kelly's Bush: eucalyptus (dominant), heath/closed shrub, closed rainforest, banksia/low closed forest and closed scrub/weed areas. The moss Racopilum cuspidigerum is known to occur here. = Condition = As at 12 January 1999, the park was intact in its 1983 conserved form. The park is substantially intact as an area of remnant bushland. = Modifications and dates = The site has seen the following modifications: *1892: established Smelting Company on two acres, with adjoining seventeen acres of bush to the north designed as buffer to the residential areas and zoned \\"open space\\". The Company allowed public access to the foreshore for recreation, through all areas except the actual works area. The condition of the bush fluctuated, depending on the amount of timber being used to fire the smelters. *1956: Almost 7 acres of \\"open space\\" became known as Weil Park when purchased by Hunter's Hill Council and Cumberland County Council. Bush cleared and a grassed oval created for sporting activities. *1967 the Smelting Company works moved to Alexandria and sold to A.V.Jennings - series of DAs - didn't progress. *SPA then arranged to buy from Jennings 5.6 acres of sloping waterfront bush and abandoned industrial reserve for a \\"foreshore reserve\\". *1971 Minister for Local Government rezoned the land from Reserved Open Space to Residential. *1977 Premier banned development on the site. The discovery of radioactive waste on the site raised serious doubts as to its suitability for residential development. *1983 Premier Wran announced that site to be set aside for full public access on a permanent basis. *1983-1999: Some improvements have been made, including a carpark, paths, foreshore park, and a viewing platform.  Heritage listing  As at 26 March 1999, Kelly's Bush Park has high local significance as a remnant of natural bushland located on the foreshores of the Parramatta River in Hunters Hill. The site has State significance as the site of the first \\"green bans\\" of the 1970s when a group of local residents enlisted the assistance of unions to oppose development of the site. Kellys Bush Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Childhood  Kurt- Friedhelm Steinwegs was born as the fifth of eight children of a casual worker and his wife. The mother died in 1970 at the age of only 35 years. After his father looked after the children alone for two years, he invited a female friend to look after the children with him, both living in a marriage-like relationship. The youngest brother was given for adoption, two brothers were housed in children's homes, and another became a criminal and was detained for it.  Home accommodation  In November 1974, Steinwegs was housed in a youth centre in Gifhorn, Lower Saxony. During this time he killed 59-year-old Ernst Dorf with a stone, but this was not revealed until years later. In April 1976, the institution saw no further funding opportunities and requested a transfer for the boy. Eventually, in October 1976 he was housed in a curative education facility in Burglengenfeld, Bavaria. In July 1977, he was released and returned to live with his father in Willich.  Murder of Andrew Robinson  While living with his father, he murdered 13-year-old Willich resident Andrew Robinson in 1978.Article in: La Vanguardia, February 15, 1984 In the broadcast of Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st, the case was reported on on June 1, 1979, but no evidence was determined to allow the authorities to track down the perpetrator. Steinwegs was not suspected of the crime.  Arrest and trial  A little while later, Steinwegs was admitted to the Psychiatric State Hospital in Viersen. During this time, according to later revelations, he killed another four people, including a fellow patient. Among other things, he separated the genitalia from his victims' bodies. Only in 1984, the police arrested Steinwegs after he had committed another murder.

The elongated park lies to the north-west of Wigan town centre with its main entrance at the junction of Bridgeman Terrace and Mesnes Park Terrace. It comprises formal flower beds in grass lawns, a pool, children's playgrounds, mini golf, sports grounds and a caf√©. It has recently undergone a multi-million pound restoration after receiving a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Listed features The park itself is Grade II listed and contains a total of seven original Grade II listed features. The main entrance gateway has carved sandstone piers and double cast iron gates with the Wigan town shield and the date of 1878. The associated entrance lodge has been refurbished and is used for meetings and weddings. On the right hand side of the main path (from the entrance to the main Pavilion feature) is the bronze statue of former local MP and benefactor Sir Francis Sharpe Powell. Touching his bronze foot is said to bring good luck. At the end of the main path is the south-east double flight of sandstone steps up to the Pavilion. At the top of the steps stands a memorial to the soldiers of the Boer War. The Pavilion is the main feature of the park, with a cafƒó and two floors of seating. The structure is constructed to an octagonal plan in cast iron, clad on the outside with brick and terracotta tiling. A second double fight of steps, similar to the south-east flight, leads down from the south-west side of the Pavilion. The 10-sided bandstand made of cast iron columns with a metal-clad wooden roof has been recently provided with electric power.

The Rector of Wigan being Lord of the Manor, it formed part of the Wigan Rectory Glebe Estate. By 1847 there were two collieries operating within the boundaries of the present park. In 1871 of the Mesnes were sold to Wigan Corporation as a site for a Grammar School and public park. The purchase was arranged by Nathaniel Eckersley, the then Mayor of Wigan. A further of land was leased and included the site of Turner's Colliery which continued in operation until 1880. A competition was held in 1877 for the design of a public park, which was won by John McClean of Castle Donington, who was then awarded the contract to supervise the work. Nathaniel Eckersley, High Sheriff of Lancashire at that time, performed the opening ceremony in August 1878.

Life  Rung was born on January 3, 1961, as the sixth of seven children. His father drank heavily and reigned with much violence and severity, while his mother left the family when he was two years old. The stepmother, Aunt Hilde, \\"sat on a throne, she was the judge\\" and ordered punishments that the father performed.Berlin district court imposed a double life imprisonment; in: Berliner Zeitung on March 6, 1996 The household lacked love, warmth and care. Rung attended a special school and was observed committing burglaries and assaults during his schooling. Before being arrested for murder in 1995, Rung was imprisoned many times for various crimes. Between 1983 and 1995 he killed a total of six women and his stepbrother in cold blood.\\"The prosecutor gets cold feet now\\"; in: Berliner Zeitung on December 14, 1995 His victims were raped, strangled, drowned or suffocated and then robbed. Due to the different methods and without the availability of DNA profiling for a long time, no connection could be made between the crimes. Two of the victims - his 77-year-old landlady and a 22-year-old student - were murdered in 1983 in the Silbersteinstra√üe in Neuk√∂lln.

The forensic psychiatrist Wilfried Rasch rated him in his report as someone who \\"committed his actions despite his normality.\\" In 2001, he tortured a prisoner at Tegel Prison and was sentenced by the Berlin court to an additional two years and eight months in prison. Because in 2003 Rung had once again injured a prisoner - this time lethally - the district court of Berlin sentenced him to 10 more years and second preventative detention for attempted manslaughter in 2004.

Her glamorous persona and publicized personal troubles have contributed to her recurring prevalence in popular culture. Turner first entered the popular culture lexicon under the nickname \\"the Sweater Girl\\" due to her feature film debut in They Won't Forget (1937), in which she appeared in a form-fitting sweater that accentuated her bust. She was the first known person to be given the nickname, which went on to be applied to numerous actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Her subsequent rise to fame at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and establishment as a sex symbol enhanced Turner's profile, and she became a popular pin-up model throughout World War II. While she enjoyed significant popularity as one of MGM's biggest stars, she was also subject to vociferous media attention over her numerous romantic affairs, eight total marriages, and her daughter's 1958 killing of Turner's lover, Johnny Stompanato, during a domestic struggle. The media focus on her storied personal life (particularly the Stompanato homicide) contributed to her cultural prevalence at the time, even sometimes serving as the basis for novels and films. In her later career and after her death, Turner would go on to appear depicted in numerous artistic works, as well as be studied by social critics and academics in discussions surrounding Hollywood, film theory, gay icons, and camp aesthetics. Timeline =20th century= Discovery story Lana Turner, 1942 The story of Turner's chance discovery by William Wilkerson at a Hollywood malt shop at age 16 was widely circulated during her lifetime, and went on to become a part of Hollywood mythology. Varied accounts as to where the discovery occurred were recounted in publication and via word of mouth during her early career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, with a popular retelling having the meeting occur at Schwab's Pharmacy. Shortly after Turner's rise to fame, the owner of the malt shop in which the discovery took place erected a metal plaque on the seat which Turner had occupied when she met Wilkerson, and soon the shop became inundated with young women hoping to experience the same chance occurrence. Wilkerson's son, journalist William Wilkerson III, wrote on the lasting cultural impact of Turner's discovery in 1995: Scholar Kim Fields similarly wrote about the lasting cultural relevance of Turner and her discovery story in her 2007 book An Intimate Affair: Women, Lingerie, and Sexuality, noting that it is emblematic of \\"the American Dream fulfilled ... Because of her, being discovered at a soda fountain has become almost as cherished an ideal as being born in a log cabin.\\" \\"The Sweater Girl\\" Following her feature film debut in Mervyn LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), Turner was the first woman to receive the nickname the \\"Sweater Girl\\" due to her form-fitting attire which accentuated her bust. Though she herself detested the nickname, it was one with which she became synonymous over the duration of her career, and it would come to be applied to several actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Several years after the release of They Won't Forget, Modern Screen journalist Nancy Squires wrote an extensive article on Turner, in which she noted that she had \\"made a sweater look like something Cleopatra was saving for the next visiting Caesar.\\" Turner's rise to fame and establishment as a Hollywood sex symbol following They Won't Forget was concurrent with World War II, and she became a prominent pin-up model at the time, appearing painted on the noses of U.S. fighter planes bearing the title \\"Tempest Turner.\\" MGM appointed her to tour the United States West Coast and sell war bonds in various cities in the summer of 1942. During the tour, Turner began giving out kisses to the highest buyers, and by the end of the 10-week tour, had sold $5.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in war bonds. Depictions in art Turner with Frank Sinatra One of the earliest popular culture references to Turner is in Frank Sinatra's 1944 recorded version of \\"Nancy (with the Laughing Face).\\" During this time, Turner and Sinatra had been carrying on a romantic affair. She would later be named in Nina Simone's 1958 version of the song \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me,\\" which appeared on her album Little Girl Blue. In 1962, writer Harold Robbins published the novel Where Love Has Gone, which was inspired by the scandal surrounding Turner after her daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed her lover, Johnny Stompanato, to death during a domestic struggle in their Beverly Hills home. A film adaptation of the novel was made in 1964. In response to the release of the novel and film, Turner told a journalist: \\"I suppose I'll be getting bugged by that question.\\" The same year, poet Frank O'Hara wrote the poem \\"Lana Turner has collapsed\\" (1964), which was based on a headline he had seen stating that Turner had collapsed at a social gathering. In 1985, artist Andy Warhol produced a silkscreen print of Turner in her youth, and she was photographed by Warhol in Polaroid the same year; one Polaroid image from the shoot would later sell in auction for $3,750. Writer James Ellroy depicted Turner again (alongside Stompanato) in his 1990 novel L.A. Confidential (1990). Brenda Bakke went on to portray her in a scene of the 1995 film adaptation by director Curtis Hanson. Also in 1990, Turner was referenced on the rap section of Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" next to stars from the Golden Age era of Hollywood such as Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall, and Marilyn Monroe. Despite her recurring prevalence in popular culture, upon her death in 1995, writer and critic John Updike wrote in The New Yorker that Turner \\"was a faded period piece, an old- fashioned glamour queen whose fifty-four films, over four decades didn't amount, retrospectively to much ... As a performer, she was purely a studio- made product.\\" =21st century= In 2002, Turner was commemorated by artist Eloy Torrez in an outdoor mural, Portrait of Hollywood, painted on the auditorium of Hollywood High School, her alma mater, alongside numerous other famous alumni. Beyonc√© Knowles, as a member of Destiny‚Äôs Child, for awhile adopted a look and fashion sense reminiscent of Turner. American singer- songwriter Elizabeth Grant ( 1985), better known as Lana Del Rey, devised her stage name inspired by Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan. A 2011 article on Del Rey in The New Yorker described Turner as a \\"titan of red-lip, Old Hollywood glamour.\\" As gay icon Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane, privately came out as a lesbian to her parents at the age of thirteen, they were supportive of her. drag in a 2013 a Chicago production of L√≠mitation of Life, based on Imitation of Life (1959) Beginning in the 1970s, it was observed by journalist Sally Quinn of The Washington Post that Turner had accumulated a following of gay men, similar to her contemporaries Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, and others. One attendee at a 1975 gala celebrating her career told Quinn: \\"She represents ... homosexuals' fantasies at a certain age in their lives. They identify with her and she's a survivor. It's like their saying, 'Let's go see how she's survived.'\\" Subsequent associations with Turner as a gay icon have centered on her personal struggles and triumphs, as well as her glamorous persona and the perceived camp aesthetics of several of her films. Scholars such as Susan Sontag noted the camp qualities of such films as The Prodigal (1955), a Biblical costume drama in which Turner portrayed a pagan temptress. The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert notes Turner's impact as a gay icon as far back as her appearance The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946): \\"[Upon the release of Imitation of Life,] Turner's gay iconocity quotient had already reached a very high level 12 years previously with the release of The Postman Always Rings Twice Even 70 years later one never comes out unscathed from a viewing. The head wrap! The shoes! The shorts! That movie is a lesson in style and in it, Turner is a lesson in stylishness.\\" Additionally, Guilbert notes Turner's personal scandals (such as the 1958 Stompanato killing), frequent romances and eight-total marriages as additional factors in her consideration as a gay icon. Scholar Robin Griffiths also considers Turner a \\"camp icon\\" due to her \\"alternately deadpan and overblown performances.\\" Author Sam Staggs noted of Turner in Imitation of Life: See also *Lana Turner filmography *Sweater girl References Works cited       popular culture Category:Cultural depictions of American women Category:Cultural depictions of actors Category:LGBT icon ","title":"Lana Turner in popular culture"},{"id":"58007779","text":"Francisco Alberto Borgonovo (born 11 May 1902, date of death unknown) was an Argentine rower.

Early years and education Eudora Stone was born in Bedford, Michigan, August 26, 1860. When she was young, her parents removed to Nebraska. Her earliest recollections are of the great West, with its prairie billows crested with pleasant homes, its balmy breezes and its sweeping gales. Her parents were highly cultured, and gave her every possible assistance and encouragement. She began to write rhymes in her childhood, and when ten years old a poem she wrote was published in \\"Our Young Folks\\". She received a good public school education. In 1878-79, she was a student in the Nebraska State University. Career She was for a time a successful school teacher. While attending Nebraska State University, she met William T. Bumstead, whom she married in 1880. She has had little time for writing but when she did write, it was mostly for the child-readers of St. Nicholas Magazine and The Youth's Companion, having been a special contributor to the latter for several years. Personal life Bumstead was of Quaker descent, and is like the Friends in her quiet tastes and sincere manners. She had few friends. Remarkably well-informed and having an analytic mind, she was a keen, though kindly, disputant, accepting nothing as proved which did not stand the test of reason. The family lived in Beatrice, Nebraska before removing to Ontario, California with their daughter. She died in 1892, and was buried at Bellevue Memorial Park, Ontario. Style and themes Their only son, died at the age of two-and-a-half years, but Bumstead did not write of the sadness occasioned by his loss, believing that it is better to spread light and gladness than clouds and sadness.

A psychiatric report described Holst as \\"untreatable and with extreme relapse probability.\\" On September 27, 1995, his former therapist Tamar Segal helped him escape from the high-security wing of Klinikum Nord's forensic science of the former LBK Hamburg in Langenhorn. The police search was initially inconclusive, but suspicion arose against Segal. After this escape assistant had been arrested three months after the escape, Holst surrendered himself on December 30, 1995 at the Police Station 31 in Hamburg's Uhlenhorst. On March 13, 1997, Holst and Segal got married in the Hamburg Detention Center. In 2003, the district court of Hamburg dismissed Holst's claim to the consummation to Segal. It was about involuntary treatment, to meet regularly without observation with his wife in a visitor's room of the hospital north. The hospital refused this, pointing to the danger to his wife's life and threatened with risk of absconding. Holst appealed against the judicial relief, but it was unsuccessful.

The League was active during the 1946-1949 Greek Civil War and during the post-civil war years, and until the fall of the Greek military dictatorship in 1974. In 1974, it renamed itself to the Friends of Democracy in Greece and started functioning on a stand-by basis. Throughout its campaigning, the League kept an active relationship with trade unions and local organisations throughout Britain and Greece, and also with the Parliamentary Labour Party.  History  The League for Democracy in Greece was mostly founded by members of parliament for the Labour Party who were disillusioned with the fact that Labour's victory in the July 1945 election had not led to a significant change in Britain's foreign policy with regards to post-war Greece. Labour had done little to change the hostile policies that Winston Churchill's government had implemented towards the Greek resistance front EAM, which was mainly an expression of the Greek Communist Party. The persecution of resistance fighters in post-war Greece continued during Clement Attlee's government, and in October 1945 Labour members and other left-wing Britons league. The League was founded in October 1945 in a public meeting held in Garrick Theatre, London, to commemorate Greece's entering the Second World War against the axis powers. Compton Mackenzie took on the role of chairman of the new organisation, though Denis Pritt chaired the meeting as Mackenzie was absent. Diana Pym was named honourable secretary (later joined by Marion Pascoe in 1946 as joint honourable secretaries) and she remained active in the organisation until its disbandment. In the ensuing meetings, the League adopted the following aims: # To rebuild and strengthen the traditional friendship between the peoples of Greece and Britain on the basis of the establishment of democracy in Greece. # To enlighten the British public about the situation in Greece and to promote cultural relations between the two countries. # To provide relief to those Greeks who suffered for their democratic beliefs and activities and to their dependents and to the dependents of those Greeks who died fighting for democracy # To work for: ## a general amnesty for all Greek democrats imprisoned for political reasons ## the restoration of trade union and civil liberties ## the suppression of armed terrorism and the trial and punishment of collaborators These continued to be the guiding aims of the organisation until its disbandment, except for the deletion of 4.3 as obsolete in the late sixties.  1946 Delegation and Tragedy in Greece  In April 1946, the League for Democracy in Greece received an invitation from the Greek Union of Democratic Associations to send a delegation to visit Greece and provide an eyewitness account of the political situation. On the 26 April, an LDG delegation consisting of Diana Pym along with the Labour MPs Norman Dodds, Stanley Tiffany and Leslie Solley arrived in Greece. The delegates split into two groups, with Solley and Tiffany going to Patras then speaking at the May Day demonstration back in Athens and Dodds and Pym going to Thessaloniki to speak at the May Day demonstration and visit villages in the surrounding area. Throughout their travels the delegates visited trade unions, jails, and politicians of the left and the center such as Ioannis Sofianopoulos. Describing the delegation's visit to the House of Commons, Leslie Solley said that \\"We were the guests of the Greek people; we met persons of our own class. Wherever we went we were received by deputations of trade unionists, deputations from cooperatives, deputations of agrarians, deputations of professional men, and we were able to come to grips with the Greek scene...\\" Upon their return, the delegates published a pamphlet entitled Tragedy in Greece relaying their experiences in Greece and their worries for the political future of the country. The pamphlet was widely circulated, and between its two printings sold over 40,000 copies.  Archives  In 1977, by a decision of the Executive Committee, the archives of the League for Democracy in Greece were donated to the Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at King's College London. They are currently held at the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives.

There, a trader described seeing a man with a headband. A patrolman, whom Prigan had asked for directions, later recalled talking to him. On the day of his arrest, he had killed 51-year-old housewife Margarethe Pohl in the forest with a club. He was observed by a student, who fled out of fear.

It was built during 1904. It is also known as Rye. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= At the time of European contact the Kelly's bush area was inhabited by the Wal Umedegal Clan who spoke the Guringai language. They lived primarily on fish and shellfish, supplementing their diet when necessary with vegetables, marsupials, birds and grubs. They were also frequently observed firing the scrub both to facilitate access to the foreshore and to flush out game. Very little is known of their social structure and religious beliefs. =Colonial history of Hunters Hill= Captain John Hunter (1737-1821) of the Sirius, charted Sydney Harbour in 1788. On 28 January 1788 he wrote in his journal: \\"A few days after my arrival with the transports in Port Jackson, I set off with a six-oared boat and a small boat, intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances would admit: I took to my assistance Mr Bradley, the first lieutenant, Mr Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the quarter-deck (midshipman Henry Waterhouse).\\" Hunter's meticulous chart shows 30 depth soundings around the peninsula bounded by the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. Hunter was Governor of the Colony from 1795-1800. He is commemorated in the name of Hunters Hill.Sherry/Hunters Hill Historical Society, 2011, 15 In 1855 a speculative housing venture of erecting four prefabricated Swiss Cottages at Hunters Hill was underway. In this period Hunters Hill was an established French enclave, with the residence of the French consul located there at \\"Passy\\", and much of its early development was constructed by men of French descent. The prefabricated houses were advertised as \\"four splendid family residences, standing in their own grounds, of about each\\", with \\"wood and water in abundance\\".Sherry 1989, 48. Beverley Sherry in her study of Hunter Hill notes that this was the first planned group of houses to be built in the municipality, marking the beginning of the garden suburb character of Australia's oldest Garden Suburb The subdivision and garden suburb development occurred in the mid to late nineteenth century, predating the formation of the Garden Suburb movement. The historic development at Hunters Hill was consistently speculative, although some of the subdivisions were undertaken to provide residences for family members. =Marika= The land on which Marika is built was part of a 30 acres grant made in 1835 to Frederick Augustus Hayne. He sold to Dr. Leopold Augustus Carter, a dentist oin 1902. The house was listed was Ryde in the Sand's Directory in 1904. In 1938 Dr. Carter sold to the Caveneagh family who sold it around 1981. From 1981 to 1983 Marika was restored. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Marika on 2 December 1983. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

She was the youngest of six daughters of stone cutter, James Walsh, and Mary Walsh (n√©e Martin) who lived in Sampson‚Äôs Lane, off Moore Street. She started selling bunches of violets for a penny at age 12, and held her own stall on Moore Street by age 17. From 1908 to 1978, Johnson sold vegetables, fruit and flowers from her stall. Her stall was located in pitch number one, on the corner of Henry Street and Moore Street. Her outgoing and friendly nature made her popular with customers and other traders. She was known for wearing a traditional Irish shawl and a green ribbon in her hair. Amongst her friends were Maureen Potter and Jimmy Durante, and the song \\"Rosie up in Moore St.\\" was about her. It is reputed that Jimmy O'Dea spoke to her for inspiration. Johnson claimed to drink more than 20 bottles of stout a day, which added to her legend as part of Dublin of a bygone era. Shortly after she was born, she moved to 12 Moore Street, and lived there until her retirement in 1978. When she left the house, it was condemned and demolished. She passed her pitch to her daughter-in-law, and she moved in with her son at Edenmore Grove, Raheny.

The six-story structure is one of the first buildings in the city to be constructed with reinforced concrete. It also had an early form of air- conditioning that utilized a 10-ton ice machine in the basement. The building initially housed the Young & McCombs Department Store, of which Best served as a financier.

After Young & McCombs the building housed the Brady-Waxenberg Department Store followed by Montgomery Ward. It has subsequently been used as an office building.

Biography Gilbert B. Cohen was born to Philip and Hannah (n√©e Borofsky) Cohen on July 28, 1931 and raised in Philadelphia where his Russian-immigrant grandparents and father operated a hardware store. He trained as an illustrator at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, where he studied under artists Karl Sherman, Henry C. Pitz, Albert Gold, Joe Krush and S. Gertrude Schell, and then graduated in 1953. Soon thereafter, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and assigned to a military intelligence unit in Germany where he rendered images of Soviet weaponry, based on verbal espionage reports. Upon his release from the Army, he resumed his chosen career in commercial art and illustration. As of 2017, Cohen maintained a studio at his home in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Career Cohen sharing painting of five Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) with four WASP alumnae. Cohen discussing his work at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Cohen's artistic career spanned more than six decades of producing images for men's magazines, movie posters, books, government agencies, and later producing carefully researched fine-art oil paintings of aviation and war-related subjects. He also assumed both teaching and administrative duties in his field of illustration. He is an Artist Fellow of the American Society of Aviation Artists. =Aviation art= Cohen‚Äôs interest in aviation began as a youth during the Second World War, when he became proficient in identifying a wide variety of aircraft of the time. This interest was renewed, when he became interested in producing World War II aviation art, which included a series of paintings depicting the activities of the Eighth Air Force‚Äîexamples of which were exhibited in a one-man show at the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler, Georgia for six months, starting December 1988. In 1997, he began publishing limited-edition prints of his aviation art, which were distributed through art-print vendors in the U.S. and Great Britain. A retrospective of Cohen's aviation art was published in 2009. A reviewer of Cohen's body of work noted that it both presented faithful depictions of aircraft and, more significantly, focused on the people involved and the emotional energy that they brought to their activities. He traveled under the auspices of the U.S. Air Force to theaters of conflict in Bosnia, Somalia, and Central Asia and also to Israel to create paintings that he donated to the U.S. Air Force Art Program. =Illustration art= ‚ÄúThe Great Balloon Race to the North Pole‚Äù, cover art for Man's World, January 1961 Duotone image of WWII soldiers retrieving a treasure for Argosy June, 1963: \\"The Greatest Souvenir\\" During the 1950s and 60s, Cohen worked as a free-lance illustrator for men's adventure magazines‚Äîa common genre of the time. One such publisher was Magazine Management Company‚Äîwith magazines that included Male, Stag, and For Men Only‚Äîwhose assignments required complex illustrations, executed on a short deadline, often involving duotone technique (using black plus one other color on the printed page). A 1961 assignment for Argosy magazine to illustrate a serialized version of Ian Fleming's James Bond novel, Thunderball, led to later assignments from another publisher to illustrate book covers for the Mack Bolan series of The Executioner novels by Don Pendleton. His illustration work expanded to more mainstream clientele that included the U.S. Information Agency, the National Park Service, Paramount Pictures, Bantam Books, Harlequin Books, Random House, Holt Rinehart & Winston, Warner-Lambert, the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Guard Bureau, and the Boeing and Sikorsky Aircraft companies. =Teaching= In 1966, Cohen received an invitation to teach at his alma mater; this led to a part-time position as an instructor and to increasing academic responsibilities. He taught figure drawing, anatomy and illustration over the course of 21 years. = Other activities = Cohen has assumed administrative duties in the art world, as well.

Alkali is the site of Alkali Hot Spring, which was operated as a spa by Geni and Joe Guisti in the 1930s. During Goldfield's peak, the site included an indoor wooden swimming pool with a separate area for children and a large building containing a dining room, kitchen, dance hall and bar. In front of the dining room were tall tamarisk trees and a large picnic table where visitors could either order from the dining room or bring their own lunches. The Guisti residence was at the rear of the dining room. Geni Guisti served young folks grape juice over ice at the bar, which was considered a real treat. Friday and Saturday night dances were attended by Tonopah residents. The waters of the spring originally appeared as a series of small seeps.

The spring is reported to contain lithium, though the surface of nearby Alkali Flat (Alkali Lake ) does not. In 2018, RAM Power held a geothermal leases near Alkali Hot Spring.
