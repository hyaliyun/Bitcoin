Even though modern consensus generally considers Pope Joan to be legendary, in the film her existence is treated as fact. It was directed by Michael Anderson and has a cast which includes Liv Ullmann (in the lead role), Olivia de Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down, Franco Nero and Maximilian Schell. The soundtrack was composed by Maurice Jarre with additional choral music provided by The Sistine Chapel Choir, directed by Domenico Bartolucci. The film was released on DVD in 2003 on Region 1 format disc. It was also re-titled in some areas as The Devil's Imposter, with much material cut. The version of the film released in 1972 differed significantly from the version that had originally been filmed. Anderson's original was made with flashbacks and flash-forward sequences about a modern-day Evangelical preacher who believes her life parallels that of Pope Joan. In this version psychiatrists try to send her back through her past lives to establish if she is the reincarnation of Pope Joan. However, the distributor decided to have all of the contemporary sequences removed and released the film as a straightforward historical drama. In 2009 the film was re-edited and the previously unreleased footage was re- inserted. It was re-released under the title She… Who Would Be Pope.

It focuses on product reviews, community news, how-to articles, programming and troubleshooting tips. The latest issue is currently available in 23 languages but that number changes depending on community members willing to translate to their native tongue. The first edition was produced in English, Estonian, Romanian, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Galician, Dutch and Indonesian. A number of Full Circle Special Editions have been compiled by contributors Robin Catling and Jonathan Hoskin. These group together article series for easy download by readers. Currently there are issues for Inkscape, Python, GIMP, Scribus and LibreOffice. History Issue 0 April 2007 The publication was initially proposed by Tucker on 29 March 2007, as a posting on the Ubuntu Forums. Forum participates quickly contributed proposed logos for the new publication. Issue 0 of Full Circle was released in April 2007 and featured stories about Ubuntu's history, features including desktop effects and new Linux games. This first edition was 17 pages in length, in portrait format. Issue 1 came out in May 2007 in English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish. Issue 4 saw a switch to PDF landscape format, for easier viewing on computer screens. By Issue 25 the magazine had grown to 28 pages. In December 2007, the Full Circle Podcast started. After two episodes, the podcast stopped production, due to the host unable to dedicate time to the podcast. In March 2010, the podcast was re- established by Robin Catling, along with Ed Hewitt and Dave Wilkins, with an entirely new format. Each episode, the podcast covers news, round up of the latest issue of the magazine, interviews, reviews and feedback from listeners. Issue 40, published in August 2010, saw the magazine update to a new logo from German designer Thorsten Wilms and switch to using Ubuntu font. In 2010 the publication started partnering with Ubuntu User, a quarterly paper magazine. Each publication provided banner ads for the other, seeing the publications and complementary to each other. Rikki Kite, the Associate Publisher of both Ubuntu User and Linux Pro Magazine wrote, \\"Ubuntu User magazine and Full Circle are working together to help promote our publications. Full Circle is a monthly online magazine, whereas Ubuntu User is a quarterly print publication. We think that many Ubuntu users will want to read both magazines, so our agreement with Full Circle to cross promote our products seemed like a great way to connect to the growing Ubuntu community.\\" In 2012 the editorial staff worked together to create the Official Full Circle Style Guide, which gives guidance to contributors to standardize the writing style for submissions. In July 2012 Les Pounder and the Blackpool Linux User Group took over hosting the podcast, starting with episode 29. In early 2016 Tucker started the Full Circle Weekly News, a short audiocast. Each episode has six or seven news items, originally read by Tucker. The hosts changed several times and is now hosted by Leo Chavez. In September 2019 Tucker issued a published plea for more material to be submitted by volunteer writers to keep the magazine going. He indicated that a number of long time columnists were coming to the end of their work and other writers would be needed if the publication was to survive.

It is the oldest communications/cyber group in the USAF and was originally chartered at the 251st Mobile Communications Group. The units assigned to the 251CEIG compromise 47.5% of the USAF's Engineering Installation capability and 47.5% of Department of Defenses Build and Extend Organic cyberspace infrastructure robust capability. The co-located 269th Combat Communications Squadron is also assigned to the 251st and is the USAF's Oldest Mobile Communications Squadrons rooted as the 1077th Signal Company Army Air Corps founded in March 1942. The Group Headquarters has 38 personnel assigned with a wartime mission to augment Major Command AFFOR staffs, Joint Force Commander staffs, Numbered Air Forces Warfighting Headquarters staffs or any Combatant Commanders cyber and Communications forward staff function. Mission The mission of the 251st CEIG is to command, organize, equip, train and administer assigned and attached forces to ensure complete mission readiness in support of emergency USAF requirements, and to provide timely and reliable communications engineering and installation in support of state emergencies. History Headquarters, 251st Combat Communications Group (CCG) was constituted at Springfield, Ohio, on 5 October 1952. Commanded by Major Charles R. Stahl, the Headquarters had an initial strength of five people. Of the existing ANG communications groups and five active duty groups, the 251CCG is the oldest, and it is also the parent unit of two other ANG combat communications groups: The 226CCG in Alabama and the 254CCG in Texas. At its inception, the group had twelve subordinate units in Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Alabama, and Arkansas. The mission of the 251st initially was a composite of the missions of today's Engineering – Installation Squadrons and Combat Communications Squadrons. While the organization was charged with providing, installing, operating, and maintaining communications equipment for deployed flying units, it did so from \\"scratch\\", with a greater variety of small components than today's relatively complete tactical capabilities. Beginning in 1953, the headquarters planned and directed Group-Wide Exercises at locations across the country, beginning with Annual Training at Stewart AFB, New York, in August of that year. In 1954, the organization was authorized with its first full-time officer Air Technician: Capt (later Lt Col) Herbert E. Moore. In that year, the headquarters strength increased to nine officers and nine enlisted personnel. The 251st started remissioning into a Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group in 2010. The current mission of the Headquarters, 251CEIG is to command, organize, equip, train and administer assigned and attached forces to ensure readiness in order to provide communications engineering and installation services to support emergency USAF requirements and to provide a staff element for management of Communications and Electronics (C-E) personnel when deployed in support of Air Force taskings. To train for its wartime mission, the 251CEIG has been deploying to Exercises since 1976, with its first overseas exercise involvement occurring in 1978. Since its first deployment to these Joint Command System (JCS) and overseas exercises, the 251CEIG has deployed personnel and equipment to Korea, the European Theater, the US Southern Command, and to South West Asia. During Operation DESERT SHIELD and Operation DESERT STORM, the 251st provided over 1,500 workdays in voluntary direct support, both in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) and in back-fill roles stateside. Today, the 251st manages all ANG EI AEF and JCS Request for Forces (RFF) taskings, T10 and T32 workload for the ANG EI community. Currently, six partial mobilization's are underway moving forces to multiple areas of responsibility. Additionally, 100 or so projects are completed yearly at a 65% cost saving over non-organic blue-suit contractors.

He is particularly noted for his technically masterful and vivid interpretations of works by lesser-known composers and his recordings of the piano music of John Field are highly regarded. Biography Pietro Spada is the second of three sons of Maria Teresa Fodale and Massimo Spada. Although not born into a musical dynasty - his parents both had law degrees - the household was never devoid of music, frequented by many well-known musicians of the time including the violinist Gioconda de Vito and the tenors Giacomo Lauri-Volpi and Tito Schipa. His great-grandfather, Jacopo Ferretti, wrote the libretto for Rossini’s la Cenerentola and collaborated as librettist with other composers such as his close friend Donizetti, Pacini and Mercadante. Spada began his study of the piano at the age of 12 under Vito Carnevali. A short time later he entered the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in Rome to study under Tito Aprea completing his diploma in piano with highest honours in 1956. Subsequently he received coaching but no formal lessons from the Italian pianist and conductor Carlo Zecchi who became one of his closest friends. In addition he frequented lessons with Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. Spada underwent composition courses with Vincenzo di Donato, Carlo Pinelli and Andrea Mascagni completing his studies at the Milan Conservatory with Giorgio Federico Ghedini. Career He has performed widely in many countries including Japan, Germany, North and South America, Russia, England and toured with the Hallé Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli. Spada performed under various eminent conductors including Charles Bruch, Dean Dixon, Antal Dorati, Arthur Fiedler, Anatole Fistoulari, Jascha Horenstein, Peter Maag, John Pritchard, Thomas Sanderling, Ferruccio Scaglia, Lovro Von Matacic, Francesco d'Avalos and many others. Spada was appointed Guest Professor of piano at Florida State University in August 1966. The following year he joined the piano faculty of the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music and later that of Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. At every university he both taught and performed before deciding to return to Italy in 1970. Later on he taught at the Turin Conservatory, the Rome Conservatory and the historical Naples Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella. There he spent his longest period as a piano professor, intensely researching in one of the most important autograph manuscript collections of the world before deciding to leave teaching. Research During his residence in the United States he was given a grant to do research on Muzio Clementi, producing a definitive edition of the Clementi Symphonies. Continuing in his research, he published and recorded many unedited keyboard compositions by Paisiello, Donizetti, Field and others. Spada, together with Massimo Boccaccini, founded Boccacini & Spada Editori through which he has issued a huge volume of hitherto unpublished compositions of great Classic composers. Prominent soloists and conductors who have presented many of Spada’s editions include Abbado, Chailly, Ferro, Gavazzeni, Gazzelloni, Muti, Pavarotti, Rampal and Schippers. Spada recorded for the first time in 1960 and continues to do so today having produced a vast amount of repertoire on CD. He is a Steinway Artist. Family Spada married in 1967 and has a son, Marcantonio M. Spada, born in Rome in 1970. He currently lives and works in Rome Italy.

Life He was born in Kent, in 1566, son of Anthony Carier, a minister of the Church of England. He was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 28 February 1582, proceeded B.A. in 1586, was elected a fellow of his college 8 March 1589, and commenced M.A. in 1590. Soon afterwards he became tutor and studied divinity, especially the works of Augustine of Hippo. He proceeded B.D. in 1597, and was appointed one of the university preachers, and incorporated at Oxford the same year. Soon after this he was presented by the Wotton family to the rectory of Paddlesworth in Kent, which he resigned in 1599. He was presented to the vicarage of Thurnham in the same county, with the church of Aldington annexed, on 27 March 1600, and that benefice till 1613. In 1602 he was presented, by Archbishop John Whitgift, whose domestic chaplain he then was, to the sinecure rectory of West Tarring in Sussex. In the same year he was created D.D. at Cambridge, and his fellowship was declared vacant. He was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to James I. On 29 April 1603 he was collated by the Archbishop of Canterbury to the living of Old Romney in Kent. In 1608 he was nominated one of the first fellows of Chelsea College, projected by Matthew Sutcliffe as a seminary for defenders of Protestantism. He obtained the king's leave to go to Spa for the benefit of his health, actually intending to study the workings of Catholicism. He went from Spa to Cologne, where he placed himself in the hands of Father Johannes Copperus, rector of the Jesuit College. King James ordered Isaac Casaubon and others to write to him (August 1613), with an injunction to return to England. Carier’s printed Missive addressed to the king from Liège, 13 December 1613, made his conversion public. Cardinal du Perron then invited him to France, for his assistance in a work which he was publishing against King James. Carier accepted the invitation, but died before mid-summer 1614. George Hakewill published an elaborate answer to Carier in 1616. Carier’s polemical works continued to be reprinted late into the century. The Carier case had repercussions, in particular for John Howson who had been on good terms with him, and came under the suspicion of George Abbot in 1615; like Humphrey Leech, another convert, Carier moved in the Durham House circle with Howson, around Richard Neile.Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600-1640 (2002), p. 53 and p. 72.

The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in England. Plot Inspector Hornleigh of Scotland Yard stumbles upon the theft of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget secrets, a crime which he ties to a murder he is investigating. Cast *Gordon Harker as Inspector Hornleigh *Alastair Sim as Sergeant Bingham *Miki Hood as Ann Gordon *Wally Patch as Sam Holt *Steven Geray as Michael Kavanos *Edward Underdown as Peter Dench *Hugh Williams as Bill Gordon *Gibb McLaughlin as Alfred Cooper *Ronald Adam as Wittens *Eliot Makeham as Alexander Parkinson, leather worker *Peter Gawthorne as the Chancellor of the Exchequer (uncredited) *Charles Carson as Chief Superintendent (uncredited) *Vi Kaley as Landlady (uncredited) *Julian Vedey as Cafe Proprietor (uncredited) Production The film is a spin-off from a popular BBC radio series of the 1930s, Inspector Hornleigh Investigates, created and written by Hans Wolfgang Priwin, which ran on the BBC from 1937 to 1940. For the purposes of the film, the leading characters are somewhat modified (and, significantly, the screenplay is not written by Priwin): the actor who played Inspector Hornleigh on the BBC, S.J. Warmington, is here replaced by comedian Gordon Harker, and is given a bumbling comedic sidekick, played by Scottish comedy actor, Alastair Sim. The BBC series was a serious detective drama. However, in this film the two leading characters play the script for laughs, and the casting of two well known comedy stars in the parts indicates that this was the director's intention. Furthermore, the pair's dialogue includes frequent jokes, and Sgt. Bingham's character is included solely as comic relief. Although the rest of the cast behave as if they are in a straight drama, this simply highlights the behaviour of Harker and Sim. To emphasise that this was a comedy film series, and to enhance the comedy double-act between Harker and Sim, the subsequent films in the series would be written by the noted comedy screenwriting partnership of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Although released in 1939, the film carries a copyright notice dated 1938. It was made by Argyle Television Films, but was given a cinema release in the UK. Reception The film was sufficiently well-received by audiences to justify two sequels: Inspector Hornleigh on Holiday (1939), and Inspector Hornleigh Goes To It (1940). *The New York Times called the film \\"a neat bit of British detective fictionizing, as tailor-made as a Bond Street jacket, now on view at the Rialto.\\" *TV Guide wrote, \\"though the film is well- plotted and well-acted (Sim is hilarious), the thick English and Scottish accents were often incomprehensible to American audiences. Aside from that, the suspense is nicely built towards a good denouement.\\" *Vintage 45 wrote, \\"this works as a mystery and the occasional snide remarks between Hornleigh and Bingham work to lighten things up a bit. The movie is fun and clever.\\" References External links * Category:1938 films Category:1938 mystery films Category:British films Category:British crime films Category:British detective films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Eugene Forde Category:Films set in London Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:1938 crime films ","title":"Inspector Hornleigh (film)"},{"id":"23155431","text":"Vasilyevo () is the name of several inhabited localities in Russia.

Ujire town. The Surya temple is probably only one of its kind because of its unique tradition of clay offerings which symbolizes man's Earthly desires. The devotees along with their clay offerings have to go to the temple preferably on Mondays along with a coconut and a kg of rice. After a thorough examination of the idol the priest accepts the offerings on behalf of God. All the offerings are placed in a circular shaped pile near the temple which consists clay models of Children, cradles, limbs, houses, automobiles, coconuts, cattle, bullock carts, snakes, tortoise, eyes, ears etc... History According to Mr.Laurie Honko, world-famous folklore expert from Finland the present age of the temple can be roughly guessed as about 1200 years with the help of his analysis and also with the guidance of folk literature. Popularity This small temple located in a remote village of Dakshina Kannada District was little known, until a special news report aired by a local news channel highlighted the religious importance and sanctity of this place. Whereas many devotional places have expensive offerings being specified by the temples and the priests, you can impress this god by just offering a structure made of clay, in return to fulfilling your wishes. The clay structures to be offered once your wishes are fulfilled and what other than the actual clay offerings made by devotees lying in the temple, can give you the evidence of sanctity of this deity. You can make a wish either by visiting the temple or sitting at your home. Once your wishes are fulfilled, all you need to offer is a small idol or doll made of clay that replicates or represents what you wished for. For instance, if you wish for a child, you can offer the replica of a cradle or the small doll that represents the child. One can find thousands of tiny clay idols and structures being offered to god lying near a small place near the temple, which is believed to be the original place where lord Sadashiva Rudra appeared and blessed his devotees. There are replicas of multistory buildings, cows and calves, cradle, couple, cars, currency notes, even computers and gadgets lying, which are offered by devotees, whose wishes are fulfilled.

It was ordered by Generaloberst Kurt Student in reprisal for the participation of the local population in the Battle of Crete that had held advancing German soldiers for two days. The destruction constituted one of the most atrocious war crimes committed during the occupation of Crete by Axis forces in World War II. Background BMW R75 with sidecar and MG34. =Local resistance= The Battle of Crete began on 20 May 1941 with a large-scale airborne invasion planned to capture the island's strategic locations. Kandanos is located on the road from Chania on the north coast to Paleochora in the south, which was a candidate landing point for potential Allied reinforcements from North Africa. The village of Kandanos had been bombed during the first days of the attack and a small motorized German detachment (riding motorcycles with MG 34 machine guns on their sidecars) attempted to move through it on 23 May 1941, aiming to reach and secure Paleochora. Albeit untrained and insufficiently armed, local civilians from Kandanos, Paleochora and nearby smaller villages with the assistance of a few Selino gendarmes, spontaneously confronted and fought the German force in Floria. On the following day, the locals gathered in larger numbers and set an ambush for the advancing German troops of the 5th Gebirgsdivision (elements of the 55 motorcycle Battalion and the 95 anti-tank BattalionOfficial History of New Zealand in the 2nd World War 1939–45.

The Nazi Occupation of Crete: 1941-1945, Praeger Publishers 1995; . =The repercussions of the resistance= During the Battle of Crete, the invading German forces had suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, the unprecedented resistance from the local population exasperated their Prussian sense of military order according to which no one but professional warriors should be allowed to fight. Even before the end of the Battle, exaggerated stories had started to circulate, attributing the excessively high casualties to torture and mutilation of paratroopers by the Cretans. Such stories proved to be false later on, as more careful investigations could identify only a few cases of mutilation all over Crete, most of which had been inflicted after death.Beevor, Antony. Crete: The Battle and the Resistance, John Murray Ltd, 1991. Penguin Books, 1992. Nevertheless, as a result of the above allegations and seeking to set an example, right after the surrender of Crete on 31 May, temporary commander General Kurt Student issued an order for launching a wave of brutal reprisals against the local population. The reprisals were to be carried out rapidly by the same units who had been confronted by the locals, omitting formalities. The razing Horst Trebes (right) with W. Gericke in July 1941. On 3 June 1941, a day after executing several civilians in Kondomari, German troops from the III Battalion of the 1st Air Landing Assault Regiment (most probably led by Oberleutnant Horst Trebes) reached Kandanos, following Student's order for reprisals. The Germans killed about 180 residents and slaughtered all livestock; all houses were torched and razed.Willingham, Matthew. Perilous Commitments: The Battle for Greece and Crete 1940-1941, Spellmount, 2005; . Nearby villages such as Floria and Kakopetro met a similar fate. After its destruction, Kandanos was declared a 'dead zone' and its remaining population was forbidden to return to the village and rebuild it. Finally, inscriptions in German and Greek were erected on each entry of the village. One read: Here stood Kandanos, destroyed in retribution for the murder of 25 German soldiers, never to be rebuilt again.Stroud, R. Kidnap in Crete: The True Story of the Abduction of a Nazi General, Bloomsbury Pub., 2015; . Aftermath A memorial to the fallen soldiers of the 95 Battalion was erected by the 5. Gebirgs Division near Floria after the surrender of Crete. The Kandanos war memorial in 2000 After the surrender of Germany, General Kurt Student was captured by the British. In May 1947, he came before a military tribunal to answer charges of mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war by his forces in Crete. Greece's demand to have Student extradited was declined. Student was found guilty of three out of eight charges and sentenced to five years in prison. However, he was given a medical discharge and was released in 1948. Student was never tried for crimes against civilians. Today, Kandanos has been rebuilt and is the seat of the eponymous municipality.

G-Con is short for G-Force Control. The standards incorporated into G-Con are constantly updated to benchmark against many of the world's toughest crash safety regulations as well as against data collected from real-world accident cases. The objective of G-Con is to control the impact energy (‘G-Force’) of a collision and reduce injuries to the vehicle occupants.  Background  G-Con was first announced in 1998 , and all Honda vehicles developed from a new platform since then are designed with G-Con technology. G-CON is part of the wider concept of Honda Advanced Technology Honda advanced technology  Test Standards  As of to date, the G-Con test includes : 1\\\\. 55 km/h full frontal collision 2\\\\. 64 km/h frontal offset collision 3\\\\. 55 km/h side collision 4\\\\. 50 km/h rear collision The scope of G-Con's test covers a wider range than many country's legal requirements. For example, the U.S. NHTSA test only covers full frontal collision but does not test vehicles against an offset deformable frontal barrier. Frontal offset collision tests are a tougher to meet but are a better representation of real world collisions because it mimics the driver's instinctive reaction to swerve away from an obstacle to avoid an accident. Rear collision tests are still not a mandatory requirement by any major automotive market. EuroNCAP have yet to incorporate rear collision though they are plans to do so in the future. EuroNCAP however covers side pole impact test and collisions with infant occupants. G-Con technology focuses on passive safety aspects. In an overall vehicle safety philosophy, active safety components are more important than passive safety.  Further developments  Most crash testings are done in a controlled laboratory environment, against static objects and thus many variables that affect a vehicle's real-world crash performance are not evaluated. One of the main problems with real world collisions is the huge disparity between weight, dimensions and body types of different vehicles on the road. When vehicles of different weight and size collide, the vehicle's passive safety features may not work as intended. The differences in vehicle designs may cause of the colliding vehicles to under-ride or over-ride, limiting the vehicle's frames to properly absorb / disperse the impact energy. This is particularly serious in a collision between a small hatchback and a large sedan / SUV. Even on a collision between two same vehicle models, the differences in their ride height due to the number of occupants on board / actual weight is sufficient to cause the two vehicle's crash members to be out of alignment with each other, causing under-riding / over-riding. Recognising this, Honda built the world's first indoor car-to-car omnidirectional crash test facility in its Tochigi R&D; Center in year 2000. This allows Honda to now simulate collisions between multiple vehicles of any body type, from any direction. With results from tests done from this facility, Honda was able to further build on its G-Con technology to incorporate Advance Compatibility Engineering, Honda's term for crash compatibility body. The 2003 JDM Honda Life is the first Honda model to be developed with ACE, to incorporate a crash compatibility body. The mini kei car Honda Life is designed to withstand collision against a 2-ton Honda Legend (Acura RL) sedan. All new Honda models developed from a new platform after that are equipped with crash compatibility body. Since then, G-Con has been further developed to also include pedestrian safety.

It is formed by a galvanometric laser head and laser source that runs along an horizontal beam (the bridge) supported by two lateral columns and sometimes by central columns. This system is placed over one or more embroidery machines, more frequently multi-head rather than single-head machines, cutting tables, roller devices, to cut out and/or engrave embroidered fabrics. History The first laser bridge for embroidery machines was invented and realized in 1998 by GMI srl an Italian company based in Vittorio Veneto (TV) Italy. The laser bridge was first presented to the public at the IMB exhibition of Cologne, Germany in 2000. GMI srl continue manufacturing laser bridges and since 1998 has largely improved the quality of its cutting systems. Before the advent of the laser bridge, fabrics were first die-cut and then appliqués were sewed or embroidered on the base fabric. Usually used was an 8 mm thick steel die with heights ranging from 50 to 100 mm depending on how many pieces were to be cut at once. This process proved to present numerous difficulties. Technology A cut piece of cloth (the appliqué) is placed above the base material that is in the embroidery machine (having a first seam reference), is fixed and finally embroidered. More recently, the manual method of cutting has been replaced by the laser cutting technology, laser plotters first, and then by laser bridges. The laser ensures better accuracy compared to manual cutting. It allows users to imitate a jagged or irregular cut as if done by hand, with the advantage that the laser solders the borders of synthetic fiber, avoiding unpleasant unthreading. The combination “laser plus embroidery machine” offered by the laser bridge also avoids double work: no longer is it necessary to cut by hand after embroidering appliqués. The process also guarantees more accurate results, because the laser works on the same frame where the embroidery machine works avoiding positioning errors. The technology uses software that guides the cutting laser head along the bridge and the reflecting mirrors (moved by electromagnetic motors). This method provides a degree of accuracy and speed of cut much greater than traditional systems (1/100 mm instead of 1/10 mm) External links * Cutting bridge Cutting bridge Category:Textile machinery ","title":"Laser cutting bridge"},{"id":"23155464","text":"Hungarian identity cards (, colloquially \\"személyi\\") are not compulsoryhttp://mno.hu/migr/nem-kotelezo-kivaltani-a-szemelyi- igazolvanyt-534874 for Hungarian citizens, although they may be obtained by anyone after birth. However, every citizen from 14 years of age must have at least one of the three identity documents: national identity card; passport, under the age of 17 years; or a photo-card driving licence for anyone over 17 years old). Citizens can travel anywhere in Europe (except Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine) as well as to Georgia, French overseas territories and Montserrat, using only this identity card (for travel to Kosovo, only the new biometric card is accepted). Currently, there are three types of valid identity documents (Személyi igazolvány, abbr. Sz.ig.). The oldest valid type is a hard-covered, multi-page book issued before 1989 by the People's Republic of Hungary (Internal passport); the second type is a soft-cover, multi-page book issued after the restoration of democracy in 1989. Each of these documents has an original photo of the owner embedded, with original signatures of the owner and the local police representative. The third type, accepted since 2000, is a plastic card, usually called a \\"Personal Identity Card\\", with the photo and the signature of the holder digitally reproduced. The card shows the owner's full name, maiden name if applicable, birth date and place, mother's name, sex, and the card's validity period, as well as the local state authority which issued the card. The card has a unique identification string composed of six numbers and two letters. It does not have any information about the owner's residential address, nor their Personal ID--this sensitive information is contained on a separate card, called the Authority ID (commonly called lakcímkártya, \\"residential address card\\"). The Personal ID, which originated in the Communist era, is no longer used as an identification number, but only as a statistical signature. Other valid documents are the passport (blue or red, containing an RFID chip) and the driver's license; an individual is required to have at least one of them on hand at all times. The Personal Identity Card was required to vote in state elections or to open a bank account in the country, but now banks should accept any of the three identity documents, such as the Passport and the photo-card driving licence.

Originating from an area of low pressure on June 5, 2004, Chanthu was first declared a tropical depression near southern Leyte Island in the Philippines. Tracking west-northwestward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm over the central Philippines before entering the South China Sea. Once over the warm waters of the sea, the system quickly intensified, attaining its peak 10-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). On June 12, the storm made landfall in Vietnam before quickly weakening over land. By June 13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated two days later. In Vietnam, Chanthu wrought substantial damage and killed 38 people. Damage from the storm was estimated at 125 billion Vietnam dong (US$7.9 million), mostly from agricultural losses. One person was also killed in Thailand. Meteorological history Severe Tropical Storm Chanthu originated out of a weak area of low pressure associated with disorganized deep convective activity located about 480 kilometres (300 mi) east-southeast of Yap on June 5\\\\. Low wind shear and weak diffluence allowed the system to gradually become organized; however, the following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) ceased monitoring the system for potential development. By June 7, convection redeveloped around the low and the JTWC resumed monitoring the low; later in the day, the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, classified it as a tropical depression. The same day, the depression entered the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and was given the local name Gener. On June 8, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system as they anticipated it to develop into a tropical storm within 24 hours. At 0000 UTC on June 9, the JTWC designated the depression as Tropical Storm 08W while located about 795 km (495 mi) southeast of Manila, Philippines. Several hours later, the storm made landfall on southern Leyte Island with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph 10-minute winds) according to the JMA and 75 km/h (45 mph 1-minute winds) according to the JTWC. Rapidly tracking towards the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the storm traversed the Philippine islands by June 10. Late on June 10, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Chanthu; the name was contributed by Cambodia and is a type of flower. Not long after being named, convection associated with the storm became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving the low pressure center partially exposed. As Chanthu neared Vietnam, it tracked over warm sea surface temperatures in the South China Sea, allowing the storm to quickly intensify. Outflow from the storm improved on June 11 and deep convection developed around the center of circulation. During a 12-hour span late on June 11 through early on June 12, the central barometric pressure of Chanthu dropped 15 hPa (mbar), falling to 975 hPa (mbar). The maximum sustained winds also rose at this time; the JMA assessed the storm to have peaked with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) as a severe tropical storm; however, the JTWC assessed Chanthu to have peaked as a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 1-minute winds). Chanthu made landfall around 1200 UTC on June 12 near Qui Nhon, Vietnam at this intensity. Due to the interaction with land, the storm rapidly weakened, with the JMA classifying it as a tropical depression early on June 13\\\\. The remnants of the storm persisted over Cambodia until June 15 at which time it dissipated. Impact and aftermath As a tropical storm, Chanthu passed through the Philippines, producing moderate rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded at Roxas where of rain fell. In Vietnam, Chanthu dropped up to , triggering flooding that killed 38 people. At least 180 homes were completely destroyed and numerous others were damaged. Tens of thousands of hectares of agricultural land was inundated by the storm. Damage from the storm were estimated at 125 billion VND (US$7.9 million). In Thailand, the remnants of Chanthu produced widespread rainfall between June 13 and 16. Daily rainfall totals peaked at in Nan, Thailand. Storm totals are not known but likely surpassed . Throughout the country, only one person perished as a result of the storm.International Disaster Database Université Catholique de Louvain 2010. Retrieved May 30, 2010. Following the storm, the Government of Vietnam allocated 36 billion Vietnamese đồng (US$2 million) in recovery funds.

The group consists of about 120 researchers at either Lund University or Lund University Hospital. The group’s ultimate goal is to find new therapies for Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. These disorders have in common that they are caused by disturbances in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia. To achieve this goal, the group wants to establish and develop a strong, multidisciplinary research environment. The ambition with the programme is to receive knowledge that improves the patients’ quality of life, through improved therapies and methods of diagnosis, and also improves the situation for the families. Researchers from Lund University Medical Faculty, Faculty of Engineering, Cultural Sciences and Lund University Hospital make up the group. The aim of this collaboration is for new therapies to be made available to the patients more quickly, and that ethical and cultural aspects are taken into consideration. The medical part of the research focuses on cell transplantation, gene therapy and finding new drugs. New clinical trials where dopamine-producing cells will be transplanted into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease are planned for 2010. An important part of the programme is acquiring knowledge of how therapies best are designed to benefit patients, their families and the society as a whole, and to take into consideration the ethical and cultural aspects of progress in biomedical research. The name Bagadilico is an acronym formed using the two initial letters from the words Basal Ganglia Disorders Linnaeus Consortium.

Robert Matthew-Walker was born in Lewisham, London, and studied at Goldsmith's College, University of London, the London College of Music and the London College of Printing (now University of the Arts, London). After leaving the Army in 1962, following service at the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC), the War Office and in North Africa, he studied composition privately with the French composer Darius Milhaud in Paris in 1962–63. He was employed in the City as Company Secretary of Thom & Cook Ltd and founded the Tunnel Club rock venue in Greenwich in 1968. He joined CBS Records in 1970; three months later he was appointed head of their classical department in London. In 1974 he became Director of Marketing for CBS, succeeding Clive Selwood. During his time there 14 of the company's singles were in the Top 50 and 7 of CBS's albums in the Top 20 in the same week. He was later Director of Masterworks Marketing, Europe, for CBS in Paris. In 1975 he joined RCA Records in London as Head of the Classical Department, where he was responsible for launching James Galway's career, and at one point, the company had three full-price classical albums in the Top 50 pop album charts at the same time. He founded several specialist classical labels, including Phoenix Records, Trax Records and AVM Classics – each of which has had at some point the number 1 best-selling classical album. Robert Matthew-Walker has produced over 130 albums, and won the Grand Prix du Disque of the Academie Charles Cros in 1980 for his recording of Brian Ferneyhough's Sonatas for String Quartet by the Berne String Quartet (the first recording of any of Ferneyhough's works), amongst several other recording awards for his work as a producer. He compiled the first two series of '100 Greatest Classics' for Filmtrax, and for Stylus 'The Pavarotti Collection' (reissued by Decca as 'The Essential Pavarotti') which sold over 600,000 copies and reached no. 8 in the pop album charts. He also appeared with the disco rapper Adamski on a dance single, 'Kraktali Daze'. Robert Matthew-Walker was for many years a member of The Critics' Circle. From 1984–88 he edited the magazine Music and Musicians, and between 1996 and 2008 the UK Grieg Society's journal The Grieg Companion (Vols 1–12). In April 2009 he became editor of Musical Opinion and its sister- publication The Organ; he is also a contributor to Classic Record Collector.See for example Darius Milhaud – the teacher and the performer on record, Autumn and Winter 2009, vols 58 & 59. He has broadcast many times and in 1980 wrote and presented an eight-part History of Classical Recording for BBC Radio.

They were a part of the National United Front of Kampuchea (Front Uni National du Kampuchea, FUNK), an association between Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who had been ousted from power in 1970, and communist forces. Origin and history Although the boundaries between the different factions were somewhat confused, the Khmer Rumdo are generally identified as those elements which were nominally loyal to Prince Sihanouk, but which were also leftist and supported by North Vietnam.Library of Congress Country Studies: Cambodia - Major Political and Military OrganizationsKiernan, B. How Pol Pot came to power, Yale UP, 2004, p.317 The faction had its origins partly in the history of the Communist Party of Kampuchea and of the early Khmer Issarak (independence) movement. Many of the early Cambodian communists had strong links with the Viet Minh, received training and support from the Vietnamese Party, and in many cases supported Sihanouk as a figure of national unity. These cadres retained senior positions in many of the areas east of the Mekong and near the Vietnamese border. The 'Khmer Rumdo' forces, accordingly, were recruited largely in the east of the country. They were differentiated from the forces loyal to the hardline 'Centre' of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, who were strongest in the west and south-west, and who were generally referred to by European and American observers as the Khmer Rouge (a name originally coined by Sihanouk to refer to Cambodian communists in general). The 'Centre', led by Saloth Sar, Son Sen and Ieng Sary, had a strongly nationalistic ideology, and did not cooperate so much with North Vietnam, receiving most of its support from China; it also disliked Sihanouk, regarding him as a 'feudal' figure. There were even periodic reports of clashes between the 'Centre' troops on the one side, and the eastern forces (and their Vietnam People's Army support) on the other – although both factions coordinated their efforts against the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK), the armed forces of Lon Nol's Khmer Republic. During the early part of the Civil War, the Khmer Rumdo were estimated to be by far the stronger element of the Cambodian forces opposing Lon Nol. In August 1971, the Khmer Republic official In Tam estimated the non- Vietnamese insurgents to number around 10,000: of these, he was forced to admit that only 4000 were true 'Khmer Rouge', the remainder being made up of Sihanoukists and Khmers fighting what they regarded as an \\"American occupation\\".Kahin, G. Southeast Asia: a testament, Routledge, 2003, p.313 After Sihanouk's 1973 visit to the 'liberated areas', however, where he was greeted with vocal support from the peasants, the 'Centre' began to quietly remove both the Sihanoukists and pro-Vietnamese cadres from the administration in the areas they controlled. By 1974, it was reported that the forces loyal to the 'Centre' were using the term Khmer Krahom – i.e. Red Khmer or Khmer Rouge – to identify themselves, rather than 'Khmer Rumdo'.Kiernan, p.335 As time went by there were reports that Khmer Rumdo were, in some cases, directly involved in activities against the Khmer Rouge administration within the 'liberated areas'. There were at least three incidents in Region 35 (Kampot Province) late 1973 in which Khmer Rumdo forces took part in action against hardline Communist Party troops, and rallied peasants protesting against attempts by Party cadres to requisition rice crops.Kiernan, B. How Pol Pot Came to Power, Yale UP, 2004, p.377 By early 1974, a large pro-Sihanouk force was reported to be attempting to gain military control of main roads in the province. In Region 37 in the Western Zone, 742 Khmer Rumdo surrendered en masse to the Lon Nol regime in March 1974, claiming they were part of a force of ten thousand who would follow if Nol gave them operational autonomy to carry on their fight against their Communist Party rivals.Kiernan, p.378. Lon Nol, however, was to refuse them. The administration in eastern Cambodia, 1970–75 Accounts obtained from refugees stated that not only did the eastern forces, under the command of Chan Chakrey, dress differently to the Khmer Rouge (wearing green military fatigues rather than the black peasants' clothing adopted by Khmer Rouge soldiers) but that in their zones of control they behaved with considerably more moderation (captured FANK officers, for example, were merely ordered to perform labour, rather than being executed as was invariably the case with the Khmer Rouge). There is also evidence that there was a greater degree of religious and economic freedom permitted in the eastern areas, even after the fall of the Lon Nol regime in 1975.Pike, D. Indochina: hearing before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, Ninety-fifth Congress, second session, August 21, 1978, p.79, 85 Purges after 1975 The senior Khmer Rouge leaders who had publicly collaborated with Sihanouk, either prior to 1970 or in the 'Unified Front', were either killed (as in the case of Hou Yuon and Hu Nim) – or marginalised (as in the case of Khieu Samphan) – after the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea. The Eastern Zone was purged by the Party Centre in 1976–77. Chakrey was executed in Tuol Sleng Detention Centre in 1976, the first high-ranking official to be sent there; while So Phim, the Eastern Zone Secretary, committed suicide. Some of the ousted Eastern Zone cadres – such as Heng Samrin – would later go on to lead the People's Republic of Kampuchea after the 1979 Vietnamese invasion.

Life Girling was educated at Twickenham County Grammar School, followed by the University of Liverpool from which she graduated BA in History and Politics in 1979. Her first job was as a graduate trainee with Ford Motors from 1979 to 1982. She then spent six years as a buyer with Argos, leaving in 1988 to become a marketing manager at Dixons. She then held similar positions with Boots and Halfords, which she left in 1993. She was a freelance trainer from 1995 to 2009.'GIRLING, Julie McCulloch', in Who's Who 2014 (London: A. & C.

Political career Girling was a Conservative member of Cotswold District Council from 1999 to 2009, serving as Leader of the Council from 2003 to 2006. She also served on Gloucestershire County Council from 2000 to 2009, rising to become its Cabinet Member for the Environment. She stepped down from both local government leadership positions in the run-up to the European Parliament elections of 2009, at which she was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for South West England. She and fellow MEP Richard Ashworth were suspended from the Conservative Party and had the whip withdrawn on 7 October 2017, after both supported a vote in Strasbourg stating that not enough progress had been made in the first-stage Brexit negotiations to allow discussion to move onto the trade-deal phase of the talks; however, they remained in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) parliamentary group. On 28 February 2018, both MEPs left the ECR group to join the European People's Party group. On 16 April 2019, it was announced that both Girling and Ashworth had joined Change UK. Girling said she was \\"looking forward to being able to use my extensive experience as part of the Change UK team\\". However, on 10 May, Girling encouraged Remain supporters in the South West to vote for the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 European Parliament election, saying they are \\"clearly the lead Remain party in the South West\\". Girling and Change UK later stated that she had never been a member or one of their MEPs. She did not stand for re-election in 2019. In June 2019 she became interim leader of the Renew Party.

A jacket is a cavity external to the vessel that permits the uniform exchange of heat between the fluid circulating in it and the walls of the vessel. There are several types of jackets, depending on the design:Santosh Singh, \\"Jacketed Vessel Design\\" * Conventional Jackets. A second shell is installed over a portion of the vessel, creating an annular space within which cooling or heating medium flows. A simple conventional jacket, with no internal components, is generally very inefficient for heat transfer because the flow media has an extremely low velocity resulting in a low heat transfer coefficient. Condensing media, such as steam or Dowtherm A, is an exception because in this case the heat transfer coefficient doesn't depend on velocity or turbulence, but instead is related to the surface area upon which the media condenses and the efficiency of removing condensate. Internals include baffles that direct flow in a spiral pattern around the jacket, and agitating nozzles that cause high turbulence at the point where the fluid is introduced into the jacket. * Half-Pipe Coil Jackets. Pipes are split lengthwise, usually with an included angle of 180 degrees (split evenly down the middle) or 120 degrees, then wound around the vessel and welded in place. * Dimple Jackets. A thin external shell is affixed to the vessel shell with spot welds located in a regular pattern, often about 50 mm on center both horizontally and vertically. These so-called dimples impart turbulence to the heating or cooling media as it flows through the jacket. * Plate Coils. Often very similar to dimple jackets, but fabricated separately as fully contained jackets that are then strapped to a vessel. They are slightly less efficient than dimple jackets because there is a double layer of metal for the heat to traverse (the plate coil inside surface and the vessel shell). They also require good bonding to the vessel jacket, to prevent an insulating gap between the plate coil and the vessel. Jackets can be applied to the entire surface of a vessel or just a portion of it. For a vertical vessel, the top head is typically left unjacketed. Jackets can be divided into zones, to divide the flow of the heating or cooling medium. Advantages include: ability to direct flow to certain portions of the jacket, such as only the bottom head when minimal heating or cooling is needed and the entire jacket when maximum heating or cooling is required; ability to provide a higher volume of flow overall (zones are piped in parallel) because the pressure drop through a zone is lower than if the entire jacket is a single zone. Jacketed vessels can be employed as chemical reactors (to remove the elevated heat of reaction) or to reduce the viscosity of high viscous fluids (such as tar). Agitation can be also used in jacketed vessels to improve the homogeneity of the fluid properties (such as temperature or concentration).

Ember had a radio development centre in Cambridge, England, and distributors worldwide. It developed ZigBee wireless networking technology that enabled companies involved in energy technologies to help make buildings and homes smarter, consume less energy, and operate more efficiently. The low-power wireless technology can be embedded into a wide variety of devices to be part of a self-organizing mesh network. All Ember products conform to IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standards. History Ember was founded in 2001 by Andrew Wheeler and Robert Poor. Both were students at MIT when they founded Ember with $3 million in seed funding led by Polaris Venture Partners with DFJ New England, Stata Venture Partners, and Bob Metcalfe. The company began by making mesh networking software for other companies' microchips and has since evolved to manufacturing ZigBee compliant chips itself.http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/01/22/embers-wireless-chips-power- smart-energy-efforts/ In 2003 Ember released its first chip, the EM2420 which was fully compliant with IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standards. Since then, Ember has released the EM260 ZigBee network co-processor and the EM250, ZigBee system- on-chip (SoC), and EmberZNet ZigBee Software in 2005. In 2007, the EmberZNet PRO was launched to provide software that supports the ZigBee PRO Feature Set. The Smart Energy Suite and new versions of ZigBee Development Tools came out in 2008. In 2009 Ember released its third generation chips, the EM300 series. In May, 2012, Ember was acquired by Silicon Labs.https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/05/21/silicon-labs-to-buy- zigbee-play-ember-corp-for-72-million/ Products Ember produces Zigbee chips, software and development tools. =Chips= * EM351 integrates a programmable ARM Cortex-M 3 processor, IEEE 802.15.4 RF transceiver, 128kB of Flash, 12 KB RAM, and the EmberZNet PRO network protocol stack which supports the ZigBee PRO Feature Set. * EM357 incorporates the features of the EM351 but has 192 KB of Flash for applications that require more memory. * EM250 SoC combines a radio transceiver with a 16-bit XAP2 microprocessor. It has embedded mesh networking software, on-chip debugging, 128kB of Flash and 5kB of RAM. It was designed for applications that require long battery life, low external component count, and a reliable networking solution. * EM260 Co- Processor combines a radio transceiver with a flash-based microprocessor. The interface allows application development with any microcontroller and tool- chain. Like the EM250 it was designed for applications that require long battery life, low external component count, and a reliable networking solution. * EM2420 was the first chip Ember created. It has since become obsolete and has been replaced by second and third generation Ember chips. =Software= * EmberZNet PRO is a ZigBee protocol software package that runs the mesh networking applications. It provides networking for applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), home automation Networks (HANs), and building automation systems. It is compliant with all the Ember chips. =Development Tools= * InSight Development Kits provide the hardware and software tools needed for application development. * InSight Desktop allows for the programming and debugging of applications. It combines a packet sniffer, network analysis features, API tracing, and a virtual UART. * InSight Adapter is used for network and microprocessor debugging and for programming chips. * InSight USB Link is a FLASH programming device that connects to any PC via USB and to Ember’s Radio Control Module (RCM). It contains the hardware and software tools that read and write applications and program FLASH memory on the chips. * AppBuilder makes network customization possible. It generates a template application that allows developers to tailor the EmberZNet PRO software to their specifications and complete the application, readying it for hardware integration and testing. It also allows configuration of the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and generates source code application with places for the developer to insert their own OEM-specific code. * xIDE is a tool-chain that supports applications being written for the EM250. It has a C-language compiler, assembler, source-level debugger, and graphical editing environment. Applications * Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)/Advanced Meter Reading (AMR): provides two way meter communications, allowing commands to be sent toward the home for multiple purposes, including “time-of-use” pricing information, demand-response actions, or remote service disconnects. During periods of peak demand, utilities use these networks to throttle high-load devices in participating homes. Utilities may also institute time-of-use pricing schemes, where the home area network (HAN) is used to communicate the current price of energy to the consumer. * Home Automation: allows household devices such as light switches and fixtures; thermostats and sensors; music, video and speaker systems; security controllers and appliances to network with one another to wirelessly automate the home. * Hospitality: allows for wireless networking of the devices in the room without the need for a retrofit. The doors and the devices in the rooms can also be remotely monitored from a central location. * Building Automation: provides building owners and property managers with HVAC, lighting, access and refrigeration control to monitor energy usage in real time to create more energy efficient environments. * Asset Management: allows for remote monitoring and tracking of assets and cold chain. It also provides container security in shipping. * Industrial Automation: wirelessly networks and automates industrial processes and allows for temperature, pressure and level sensing as well as providing temperature and flow control. * Defense: provides both battlefield and shipboard monitoring.

He was the holder of several papal honors, including being a papal duke ad personam (non-hereditary). Early life Brady was born on October 27, 1878, in Albany, New York. His father was the industrialist Anthony N. Brady. He graduated from Yale University in 1899. He was raised an Episcopalian but converted to Catholicism. Career Brady and his brother James Cox Brady, Sr. oversaw a vast business empire built by their father. James Brady died in 1927, and Nicholas continued running the businesses. He was Chairman of the board of directors of New York Edison Co. and a director of Anaconda Copper Mining Co., Westinghouse Electric, National City Bank, Union Carbide, and numerous other companies in the United States and Japan whose activities were primarily in utilities. The Brady brothers provided substantial funds to enable Walter Chrysler both to take over the ailing Maxwell Motor Company and to acquire Chrysler Corporation. Nicholas became a lifelong member of Chrysler's board of directors. Personal life Brady married Genevieve Garvan, sister of Francis Patrick Garvan. The couple had no children. A devout Roman Catholic, she was a Dame of the Order of Malta, Dame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, holder of the papal Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice, founder of the Carroll Club (\\"for Catholic business girls\\"), the 1933 recipient of the University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal as the most notable lay Catholic in America, a Board Chairman of the Girl Scouts of the USA, and a Vice-President of the Welfare Council of New York. Brady was a lay adviser to the Roman Catholic Church and the second American, after Francis Augustus MacNutt, to be named Papal Chamberlain. In 1926, he was ennobled by Pope Pius XI and created a Papal Duke (ad personam, or non-hereditary). His wife was created a papal duchess in her own right. The couple lived at 910 Fifth Avenue in New York City but also built a large Tudor Elizabethan mansion on a Manhasset estate that was completed by 1920 and known as \\"Inisfada\\" (Gaelic for \\"Long Island\\"). It was here that she entertained Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII, on his American tour in 1936. The duchess later gave the estate to the Society of Jesus.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930896,00.html Inisfada was used as The St. Ignatius Jesuit Retreat House before it was controversially sold and demolished in 2013. Brady is buried in a crypt beneath an altar in the main chapel at the Jesuit Novitiate, St. Isaac Jogues, at Wernersville, Pennsylvania, an institution to which he donated more than $2 million. Genevieve Brady remarried to the Irish Free State Minister to the Vatican, William J. Babington Macaulay. The papal duchess died in Rome in 1938 and her body was returned to the United States and buried beside Nicholas'. In the Church of St. Patrick in Rome a large plaque honors her life and contributions to the Catholic Church both in Rome and America. The Stations of the Cross in the church were presented to it by her second husband.

George Whitmore, Jr., was charged with this and other crimes but later cleared. The actions of the police department led Whitmore to be improperly accused of this and other crimes, including the murder of Minnie Edmonds and the attempted rape and assault of Elba Borrero. Whitmore was wrongfully incarcerated for 1,216 days — from his arrest on April 24, 1964, until his release on bond on July 13, 1966, and from the revocation of his bond on February 28, 1972 until his exoneration on April 10, 1973. This was after what author T.J. English called, in his book The Savage City, \\"a numbing cycle of trials, convictions, convictions overturned, retrials, and appeals\\", Whitmore was cleared of all charges and released. Whitmore's treatment by the authorities was cited as an example that led the U.S. Supreme Court to issue the guidelines known as the Miranda rights, with the Supreme Court calling Mr. Whitmore's case \\"the most conspicuous example\\" of police coercion in the country when it issued its 1966 ruling establishing a set of protections for suspects, including the right to remain silent, in Miranda v. Arizona. Crimes On August 28, 1963, Patricia Tolles, 23, who worked at the book division at Time-Life, returned to her apartment on the third floor of 57 East 88th Street. There she found the apartment ransacked and covered in blood. The bodies of her roommates, Newsweek researcher Janice Wylie (aged 21) and schoolteacher Emily Hoffert (aged 23), were in one of the bedrooms. Both had been stabbed over 60 times with knives from their own kitchen and there was evidence that Wylie, who was wearing only a towel, had been sexually assaulted. The case was dubbed the \\"Career Girls Murders\\" by the media because Wylie, the daughter of an advertising executive and novelist Max Wylie and niece of novelist Philip Wylie, and Hoffert were representative of the thousands of young women who had come from all over America to New York and other larger cities to seek jobs and careers. Others like them now felt unsafe and the police were under pressure to solve the case. Hundreds of detectives were assigned to the investigation and thousands of people were interviewed, but as the weeks went by no arrests were made. Investigation Initially, police believed that the victims knew their killer. The level of violence found is usually an indication of a personal relationship with the victim. There were no signs of forced entry and the apartment, which was on the third floor of a nine-story building, was also guarded by a doorman. Though the apartment was in disarray, nothing appeared to be stolen so robbery was not believed to be a motive. The victims' hands and feet were bound and then they were tied back-to-back to each other while Wylie was nude and Hoffert was dressed. Two bloody 10- to 12-inch carving knives were found next to the bodies and an additional knife in one of the two bathrooms. Police theorized that the women were attacked and murdered in the bedroom where their bodies were discovered. They did not immediately release information regarding the rape of Wylie. In fact, they told the press that it did not appear that either had been raped, but allowed that an autopsy might reveal otherwise. They did say that the women had been slashed repeatedly in the neck and abdomen. The focus on interviewing the people named in Wylie's green address book did not lead to identifying a suspect. A $10,000 reward was established to aid in the apprehension of a culprit. Janice Wylie's father, Max Wylie, penned a book \\"Career Girl, Watch Your Step!\\", a year after the murders, warning career girls of safety and the need to be aware and \\"feel threatened\\" as a defence. Like Max Wylie, everyone initially believed that the attacks were against women who had careers, as both of the victims fit that profile. Women, specifically white women, were left to feel vulnerable despite their desire to gain freedom and independence through their careers. Many other handbooks, aimed at the safety of single women, were written as an aftermath and issued by local police departments and public safety departments. These handbooks mostly emphasized the importance of prevention of the attacks including having male protection and needing physical security. Wrong suspect In April the following year, Elba Borrero identified George Whitmore, Jr., a nineteen-year- old day laborer, as the man who had attempted to rape her a few days prior. Borrero would later acknowledge that Whitmore was the only suspect police had shown her. When Whitmore was arrested, it was found that he was in possession of a photo of a white blonde woman. Brooklyn detectives Joe DiPrima and Edward Bulger jumped to the conclusion that the blonde in the photo was Janice Wylie, although her family denied it. The photo was that of Arlene Franco, a high school classmate of Whitmore, living in New Jersey, who had lost or discarded it in a park, where Whitmore found it and for some reason decided to keep it in his wallet. Whitmore immediately became a suspect in the Wylie and Hoffert double murder. Detectives DiPrima and Bulger proceeded to question Whitmore about the Wylie-Hoffert murders and after hours of leading questions Whitmore finally confessed. New York City police announced that Whitmore had confessed to the murders of Wylie and Hoffert, as well as the murder of Minnie Edmonds (an unrelated murder) and the attempted rape of Borrero. The NYPD announced Whitmore had given details of the Wylie-Hoffert killings which only the murderer could have known, but Manhattan prosecutors noticed that every detail in the Whitmore confession was known to the police beforehand. Police stated he had drawn a detailed diagram of the apartment and had in his wallet a photo of Janice Wylie that had been stolen from the flat. Whitmore repudiated his confessions, claiming he had been beaten during the interrogations; that counsel had not been present; and that his request for a lie detector test had been denied. Witnesses were located claiming Whitmore had been in Wildwood, New Jersey at the time of the Manhattan murders, watching a live TV broadcast speech of Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington, 159 miles away from the crime scene. Despite Whitmore's discredited confession, New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan did not dismiss the indictment against him. New leads On October 9, 1964, Nathan \\"Jimmy\\" Delaney (aged 35), a junkie and small-time dealer, was arrested for the murder of a rival drug dealer, Roberto Cruz del Valle. Facing the death penalty, Delaney offered to make a deal: in return for leniency, he would give police the name of the real \\"career girls\\" killer, and he claimed it was not Whitmore. Delaney explained to police that on the day of the killings he had met an old acquaintance, Richard \\"Ricky\\" Robles, who had told him that he had committed the murders of Wylie and Hoffert. Robles, a 22-year-old burglar, had a long record of drug use and had been released from prison just two months prior to the murders. To support his habit, Robles needed anywhere from $30 to $50 per day. Delaney told detectives that Robles had turned up at his apartment on the day of the killings demanding drugs while his hands and clothes were covered in blood. The shaken Robles told Delaney, “I just iced two dames.” His clothes had blood spatters on them; Delaney gave him a shirt and a pair of pants to change into. Delaney said he then went out to buy drugs with money Robles had given him. Delaney and his wife, Marjorie, were wired with listening devices, which were also installed in their and Robles' apartments. Over time, Robles talked about details of the murders that convinced investigators he was the real killer; he was arrested and charged on January 26, 1965. Second arrest and conviction In the autumn of 1965, Robles was tried for the Wylie-Hoffert murders. His attorneys attempted to buoy the credibility of Whitmore's Wylie-Hoffert confession to create a reasonable doubt that their own client had committed the crime. However, prosecutor John F. Keenan replied by summoning Whitmore and the detectives who had arrested him. Robles' attorneys were unable to translate doubts about police interrogation methods to their own client's advantage, despite testimony that Robles had confessed to the Wylie-Hoffert murders while suffering from heroin withdrawal and without his attorney present. Delaney testified that Robles told him the motive for the murders was because Hoffert told him that she could identify him to police. It was pointed out by Robles' attorney that Delaney was given immunity in exchange for his testimony. On December 1, 1965, Robles was found guilty of the murders of Emily Hoffert and Janice Wylie and sentenced to life in prison. Just months before, the New York Legislature had abolished the death penalty, except in the cases of the killing of police officers, prison guards, and murders committed while escaping jail. He was found guilty, largely on the basis of secretly tape-recorded conversations about the murders. Despite the conviction of Robles, numerous questions regarding the police conduct, in this case, were left unanswered. > \\"Police detectives, who may have been motivated by their sense of justice, > resorted to highly questionable means to extract a confession from a suspect > who was too weak to resist. Their colossal blunders in the career girls > murder case almost put George Whitmore Jr. on death row for a crime he > certainly did not commit. No formal charges were ever brought against > Detectives Bulger and DiPrima who consistently denied any wrongdoing in the > case. But exactly how Whitmore was able to supply a 61-page confession to a > double murder he never committed was never explained.\\" Robles, who had himself publicly protested his innocence over the original double-murders, did not admit his guilt until a parole board hearing in November 1986. He admitted he had broken into the apartment to obtain money for drugs and had assumed at first it was empty. When Wylie, who had been taking a shower, appeared, he attacked and raped her. Hoffert had turned up shortly afterward and he attacked her as well. Defiantly, she told him that she would remember his face and report him to the police, whereupon he murdered both her and Wylie. The three-member panel rejected granting parole, citing \\"the nature of the crime\\". No charges were pressed against the police officers who had obtained Whitmore's \\"confessions\\". Legacy The case of Whitmore and his treatment by the police was one of many examples used by the US Supreme Court when it issued the guidelines known as the Miranda rights in June 1966 by which, when a defendant is taken into custody and accused of a crime, he must be advised of his constitutional rights. The court acknowledged that coercive interrogations could produce false confessions, and in a footnote stated: [t]he most conspicuous example occurred in New York in 1964 when a Negro of limited intelligence confessed to two brutal murders and a rape which he had not committed. When this was discovered, the prosecutor was reported as saying: \\"Call it what you want — brain-washing, hypnosis, fright. The only thing I don't believe is that Whitmore was beaten.\\" Janice Wylie's mother and sister, Isobel Wylie and Pamela Wylie Sullivan, respectively, both died within five years of the murders, the former from cancer. Max Wylie committed suicide by gunshot in 1975 in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Whitmore made a life for himself in Wildwood, New Jersey. He successfully sued for false arrest and was awarded $500,000 from the City of New York. He operated a commercial fishing boat for a time, but he was later disabled in a boating accident. He blew through the award money, was unemployed for long stretches, and suffered from depression and alcoholism. Whitmore never married, but was the father of four daughters and two sons. George Whitmore Jr. died on October 8, 2012, in a nursing home of a heart attack. He was 68 years old. Richard Robles, known as New York State Inmate #66A0003, is currently imprisoned in the Greene Correctional Facility and has been denied parole multiple times. While in jail, Robles has taught fellow prisoners computer skills and also has received an associate degree.http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130 In popular culture * The case served as the basis of the 1973 television movie The Marcus-Nelson Murders, which in turn served as a pilot for the crime drama series Kojak. * A 1973 novel titled The Killings, by Edgar-winning author Clark Howard, also fictionalized the case, changing the setting from NYC to Los Angeles. * In a 2009 episode of Mad Men (season 3, episode 9, \\"Wee Small Hours\\"), two characters hear the beginning of a radio broadcast, in which the newscaster reports that the bodies of the victims, Wylie and Hoffert, had been found in their apartment. * The case was revisited in 2013 in Investigation Discovery's series A Crime to Remember (Season 1, Episode 2, \\"The Career Girl Murders\\").

Though not known for any lead spots acquired by Gladys Horton, Wanda Young, or Ann Bogan, Schaffner's role was as notable as she was the only member to survive the group's several incarnations that occurred during the 1960s until breaking up in 1970. Biography Although born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Katherine Anderson was raised in the Detroit suburb of Inkster, Michigan, where she developed a fondness for singing in her teens. In 1960, she helped to form a group with fellow high schoolers Gladys Horton, Georgia Dobbins and her friends Juanita Cowart and Georgeanna Tillman. The group named themselves the Casinyets and began performing at local high-schools and basement parties before finally landing an important audition at Motown where, already changing their name to the Marvels, they performed a rendition of a song that Dobbins had co-written called \\"Please Mr. Postman\\". It became Motown's first No. 1 pop hit. Fellow Inkster High class mate Wanda Young replaced Dobbins and the group recorded \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" in 1961 signing to Motown as the Marvelettes. Anderson was in the background throughout her tenure in the Marvelettes while Horton and Young each sung lead vocals on the Marvelettes songs. The first departure after Dobbins left occurred in 1962 when Cowart quit. Two years later, due to an impending marriage and battles with sickle cell and lupus, Tillman also resigned. In 1968, Gladys Horton left the group citing marriage as the reason for her departure and was replaced by Ann Bogan. In 1970, the Marvelettes split up; Anderson quit show business. When Gladys Horton wanted to reform the group, Anderson, who was married to Joe Schaffner, declined to join. In 1995, the Marvelettes won a Pioneer Award at the R&B; Foundation Awards. In 2004, they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.The Marvelettes at the Vocal Group Hall of Fame The following year, the Marvelettes classic singles \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" and \\"Don't Mess With Bill\\" each received million-selling Gold certifications by the RIAA. Of all the original Marvelettes, Katherine is the most active today. Katherine retired from singing when the Marvelettes group disbanded in 1970. She became very involved in helping troubled teenagers in the Detroit area. She is the mother of two adult daughters. Kat still resides in Inkster as of 2016. Katherine was present for Motown's 50th Anniversary celebration, held at the historic Roostertail nightclub in downtown Detroit on November 21, 2009. The Marvelettes were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 and again in 2015.

It has more than 300 stores worldwide, including ones located in the high fashion shopping districts of several major cities: Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Madison Avenue in New York City, Old Bond Street in London, and Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Milan. History Founded in 1980, Marina Rinaldi Group takes its name from the great-grandmother of the founder of Max Mara Fashion Group, Achille Maramotti, who in 1850 owned a fashion atelier in Reggio Emilia, Italy.‘Max Mara Fashion Group’, Marina Rinaldi. Since 1984 its collections have been available internationally from stores in such cities as Paris, Tokyo, Moscow and Düsseldorf.Marina Rinaldi - Dizionario della Moda - DellaModa.it (registration required) Until the founding of Marina Rinaldi there was no fashion group concerned with the fashion needs of curvaceous women. Marketing A Marina Rinaldi store window from July 2011 Marina Rinaldi began advertising in 1981. From its very first advertising campaigns, developed together with Emanuele Pirella, the brand developed a pioneering concept in an area where advertising aimed at plus-size women was nonexistent. The first idea was to present a line of clothing that could satisfy the needs of women who had, until then, been neglected by fashion and stylists. Marina Rinaldi was the first to introduce the Italian expression taglia comoda (“plus-size”, literally, “comfortable size”), replacing the traditional term taglia forte (“outsize”) which had been used until then to describe this type of product. Marina Rinaldi has employed some of the world’s most famous photographers in its advertising, including Arthur Elgort, Peter Lindbergh, Patrick Demarchelier, Greg Kadel, and Craig McDean. The faces of the brand have included India Hicks from Autumn-Winter 1998 to Autumn-Winter 2000, Carré Otis from Spring-Summer 2002 to Autumn-Winter 2003, and Tatjana Patitz from autumn 2009. In 1991 MR Characters, the brand’s house organ, became the first Italian magazine dedicated entirely to the demands and desires of curvaceous women, and included not only fashion reports, but also articles on design, literature, art, cooking, travel, beauty and wellness. In 1992, 450,000 copies of the first issue of this free semiannual magazine were distributed in English, French and Spanish translation at Marina Rinaldi stores worldwide. In July 2010 Marina Rinaldi collaborated with UK pop band Temposhark using their songs Joy and Crime to promote their latest fashion campaigns. In 2011 Marina Rinaldi launched MR Denim Collection, the collection dedicated to jeans. 7 styles for 7 different fits with Crystal Renn, curvy top model, as the new testimonial.

Biography  Christophe Gbenye was born in Bas-Uélé District, Orientale Province in the Belgian Congo in 1927 as a member of the Mbua tribe. Relatively little is known about his early life. He served as a clerk for the Stanleyville municipal government's finance department and became a trade unionist. He later served as the vice president of the eastern Congo branch of the General Labour Federation of Belgium which in 1951 became the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of the Congo. Gbenye joined Patrice Lumumba's independence oriented Mouvement National Congolais (MNC-L) in the late 1950s, and became a prominent leader of the party by 1959. Lumumba appointed him minister of the interior in the first Congolese parliament in 1960 following independence. In September, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba from his position as prime minister. Gbenye was also dismissed, and he retired to Stanleyville where he enjoyed political support. Lumumba's eventual arrest and execution in January 1961 deeply angered Gbenye, though he did briefly return to his position as interior minister under Cyrille Adoula's coalition government. He replaced Lumumba as president of the MNC-L. However, Gbenye was seen as a political liability by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, which was largely responsibly for Adoula's rise to power. Adoula then dismissed Gbenye, ostensibly because of his political rivalry with Victor Nendaka Bika, though Gbenye remained in parliament through early 1962. He then briefly returned to eastern Congo, then under the control of Antoine Gizenga's rebel government. In September 1963 he relocated to Brazzaville in the neighbouring Republic of the Congo. On 3 October, Gbenye, Bocheley Davidson, Gaston Soumialot, and other dissidents established the revolutionary organization Comité National de Libération. Assistance was sought from the Soviet Union in the form of equipment and training. In 1964, under the leadership of Gbenye, Mulele and Soumialot, much of the eastern Congo was overrun by young rebel fighters who called themselves simbas (lions). Gbenye served as President of the rebel state, the People's Republic of the Congo (République populaire du Congo), established by the rebels in Stanleyville (modern Kisangani). By late 1965 the rebellion had been suppressed by the Congo's central government, under the tacit control of Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, and Gbenye and others soon fled the country. From 1966 to 1971 Gbenye lived in exile in Uganda. In 2010 the then 83-year-old Gbenye was living in retirement in Kinshasa. He died on 3 February 2015.Itimbiri ya Sika, 5th of February 2015  See also  *Gold Scandal (1965)  References  Category:Year of birth missing Category:1920s births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Bas-Uélé Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo rebels Category:People of the Congo Crisis Category:Mouvement National Congolais politicians Category:Government ministers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo exiles Category:Lumumba Government members Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo expatriates in Uganda ","title":"Christophe Gbenye"},{"id":"23156247","text":"The Entrepreneurship & Innovation Center is a center created to promote Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Florida.

Camber thrust is generated when a point on the outer surface of a leaned and rotating tire, that would normally follow a path that is elliptical when projected onto the ground, is forced to follow a straight path while coming in contact with the ground, due to friction. This deviation towards the direction of the lean causes a deformation in the tire tread and carcass that is transmitted to the vehicle as a force in the direction of the lean. Camber thrust is approximately linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady- state value nearly instantaneously after a change in camber angle, and so does not have an associated relaxation length. Bias-ply tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that the two sides of the contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement. On bikes On bicycles and motorcycles, camber thrust contributes to the centripetal force necessary to cause the vehicle to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, can be the largest contributor, and in some cases is the sole contributor. Camber thrust contributes to the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal. On automobiles On automobiles, camber thrust may contribute to or subtract from the total centripetal force generated by the tire, depending on the camber angle. On a well-aligned vehicle, camber thrust from the tires on each side balances out. On a surface rough enough for one front tire to momentarily lose traction, camber thrust from the other front tire can cause the vehicle to wander or feel skittish.

It exhibits the museum's collection of hand-tools and household equipment. Background The Shaker Shed, an unornamented structure, originally served Canterbury Shaker Village, a large Shaker community in Canterbury, New Hampshire. Dubbed \\"Shakers\\" because of the frenetic dancing involved in their worship service, their religious sect was formally known as the United Society of Believers in the First and Second Appearance of Christ. Guided by self-sufficiency, hard work, and celibacy, the Shakers were widely known in the nineteenth century for the quality of their crafts and garden products. They produced unadorned and finely crafted furnishings, seeds, and herbal medicines for the community, which they eventually sold nationwide by wagon and by mail. History Built in 1840 as a one-story horse and carriage stand, the shed has five granite pillars, visible between the carriage bays, which strengthen the heavy timber framework. The original proprietors enlarged the basic structure twice over a period of thirteen years: in 1850 an addition of one and a half upper stories provided storage space for brooms made and sold by the Canterbury community, and in 1853 the Shakers added a shed to the rear of the building to store their farm machinery. =Relocation= The Shelburne Museum moved the Shaker Shed to the grounds in 1951 to serve as exhibition space for the collection of hand-tools and household equipment. Collection Shelburne Museum’s collection of woodworking tools encompasses a wide variety of hand tools and machinery that craftspeople, such as carpenters, joiners, cabinetmakers, and coopers, used to provide essential goods and services to their local communities. Craftsmen, who worked primarily with readily available, native woods, required specialized tools to create their products. To construct buildings, early settlers would fell trees using axes and shape the logs into heavy, squared lumber with adzes. They would then interlock the lumber using mortise and tenon joints, secured with wooden pins, to create a structure's frame. Unlike iron nails, the wooden pins would expand and contract with the building's frame. All of the museum's historic structures, but most clearly the second floor of the Horseshoe Barn, reflect mortise and tenon joinery. The American building trade became highly specialized: sawyers would work in teams to saw boards and planks from felled timber; carpenters would frame houses, lay floors, and build staircases; joiners focused on finer work, such as fitting joints, framing doors and windows, and preparing paneling, moldings and trim; while cabinetmakers, who employed many of the same skills as joiners, created chests-of-drawers, desks, tables, and other furniture. Planes, used to prepare surfaces, fit joints, and cut particular decorative shapes for moldings and trim, remained the most specialized tool that woodworkers used. Craftsmen developed dozens of different planes for precise use. A typical joiner or cabinetmaker's tool chest contained twenty to fifty planes. Coopering, or barrel making, remained an important occupation through the nineteenth century. Using froes to split barrel staves and curved \\"sun\\" planes to shape the ends of mounted staves, coopers produced containers of all sizes. Ranging from small water and liquor kegs to 206-gallon hogsheads, their barrels stored goods including tobacco, whale oil, whiskey, molasses, flour, apples, sugar, and hardware. Household appliances such as water tubs, sap buckets, butter churns, milk pails, and drinking or ladling mugs called piggins, reflected the extensive reach of a cooper's trade. The United States 1850 census recorded 43,000 practicing coopers, but by the late nineteenth century, the introduction of metal drums and other machine-made storage and shipping containers greatly diminished the demand for wooden cooperage, so that today the craft is almost nonexistent. The inaccessibility of processed metals in early American meant that people incorporated wood into all aspects of construction, including plumbing. Early American underground water pipes were made of cedar or pine logs that had been cut while still green, hollowed out with special augers and fitted together. They linked supply sources such as springs or reservoirs with homes and businesses. These pump logs were virtually indestructible so that some were still used in Philadelphia as late as the 1950s.

Rumbiak is the Foreign Affairs representative of the Federated Republic of West Papua declared at the conclusion of the Third Papuan People's Congress on 19 October 2011. Rumbiak's advice from within West Papua to not attend the Congress for security reasons was vindicated in the crack-down which led to six deaths, hundreds of arrests and the sentencing of five of the principal figures to three years gaol each for treason. Rumbiak was born in Yabon in the highland district of Ayamaru in Dutch New Guinea and was eight years old when the UN handed his country over to Indonesia in 1963. His parents are from Biak-Numfoor Island on the north coast. Both were primary school teachers, his father also a Protestant pastor. His mother died in 1982 when he was studying in West Java. In 1967 his family fled to the jungle from the Indonesian military which had overtaken West Papua. There they were protected by the Free Papua Organization (OPM). Jacob became involved with the OPM and at a young age became a commander of troops. He finally returned to the towns and was exiled with an education scholarship to Java in 1978. Rumbiak graduated from the Indonesia University of Education in Bandung (where he spent nine years), with a BA (1982 Maths) and Masters (1987 Geography). By 1987 Jacob was an academic at the Indonesian National Scientific Institute; the Physical Geography Research Institute for East Indonesia; and the Environment Resource Institute of Indonesia. In 1987 he was appointed to teach in Astronomy and Meteorology at Cenderawasih University in Jayapura. Jacob became increasingly politicised, and committed to a non- violent campaign of resistance based on universal concepts like ‘justice, peace and love’ he began educating student activists. Together with Dr Thomas Wainggai he established the West Melanesia Council. In 1988 Dr Wainggai and his wife were arrested, and the next year Jacob took refuge in the PNG Consulate in Jayapura. Despite the Indonesian assurances of his safety, when Jacob left the Consulate he was arrested, and in 1989 then sentenced to life imprisonment for subversion. Rumbiak was moved through eight military and four civilian prisons, including five years on death row at Kalisosok where he completed a degree in theology. He then spent two and a half years in isolation at the top of a stone tower in Tangerang Prison (West Java); Jacob attests that his survival was only by God’s grace. After intervention by the International Committee of the Red Cross, he was moved to Cipinang Penitentiary Institution, which he described in the foreword of Xanana Gusmão’s autobiography as a ‘first-class Indonesian jail’. As a student, lecturer, and later in prison, Jacob studied and experimented with ‘non- violence’ and ‘democracy’ on the streets of Jakarta and West Java, helping to inspire the generation of Indonesian students who brought down President Suharto in 1998. With other intellectuals and ex-political prisoners he developed the West Melanesia Council, an indigenous non-violent Melanesian based movement for self- determination and independence which became the philosophical and political foundations of the West Papua National Authority. In 1998, following the downfall of Suharto, he was released to ‘house arrest’ inside military barracks. The next year he managed to fly to East Timor as an accredited UN observer for the referendum, and escaped on a RAAF Hercules plane to Darwin. Jacob has lived in Australia since his escape in 1999, and has been an Australian citizen since 2006. He was a member of West Papua’s delegation to the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji in 2002, in New Zealand in 2003, and Fiji in 2006. In 2003 he was a member of West Papua’s delegation to the European Union in Brussels. In 2004 he wrote a briefing paper for the British Government, and represented the West Papua National Authority at the Japanese Foreign Affairs Department in Tokyo. In 2005, he organized the West Papua National Authority delegation to the Melanesian Spearhead Group meeting in PNG, and in 2006 met the United Decolonization Committee in Fiji. In 2006 he attended the First Nation’s International Solidarity meeting in Canada, and in 2007 co-hosted the first Melanesian Cultural Festival in the Netherlands. Rumbiak has dedicated himself to achieving self-determination for the people of West Papua by peaceful means. On 19 Oct 2011 the Third Papuan People's Congress (Abepura, Jayapura) declared an independent Federal Republic of West Papua (FRWP), with Forkorus Yaboisembut appointed President and Edison Waromi appointed Prime Minister. Both were arrested and incarcerated with sentences of three years. Jacob Rumbiak has been appointed the Republic's Foreign Minister. On 23 June 2014 the Office of FRWP Dept Foreign Affairs, Immigration & Trade was opened in Docklands, Melbourne. In his opening speech Rumbiak stated that , according to State Administration theory, when a political society has established the five pre-requisites of a nation state, they are equal with other nation-states, and should be treated like one, and that West Papua has fulfilled those prerequisites, unlike America and Indonesia when they declared independence. With a view to a successful application by West Papua to join the Melanesian Spearhead Group, at historic unity meetings in Vanuatu, on 6 Dec 2014 Rumbiak was elected as one of the five international representatives of the newly formed United Liberation Movement for West Papua, a unity body comprising the FRWP, the West Papua Coalition for Liberation and the West Papua National Parliament. On 14 July 2016 at a MSG Special Leader's Summit in Honiara, the ULMWP was admitted with Observer status, the decision on full membership being deferred for technical reasons.

The event was founded in 1982, after members of the folk ensemble Mackinaw had attended a similar festival in Dijon, France. The last festival was held in summer 2017 festival, after which it ceased to exist. During the eleven days of celebration, dozens of renowned artists and folk ensembles from around the world participated in this event which attracted in its last years an average of over 300,000 visits per year. The annual budget was 2.2 million Canadian dollars and the economic benefits were estimated at 16.7 million Canadian dollars, according to a study conducted by the survey firm CROP in 2007. Such statistics made the Mondial des Cultures one of the four largest folk festivals in the world. It was also one of the figureheads of the Canadian Section of the CIOFF (International Organization of Folklore Festival and Traditional Arts), an organization in formal consultative relations with UNESCO.  Mission  The Mondial des Cultures aimed to hold a high quality festival for spectators that are eager to discover cultures of the world while respecting its mission to: \\"Develop and hold an international cultural event which displays the facets of various traditions of the world in a festival for the whole family where a brotherhood and universal spirit of peace prevails.\\"  History  The very first edition of the Mondial des Cultures was founded in July 1982 thanks to the support of the Canadian Council of Folk Art (Conseil Canadien des arts populaires) and the Carrefour socio-culturel of Drummondville. The spontaneous support of the local population made the success of the event instantaneous and the festival rapidly became a reference in the Québec Folklore, in North America and around the world. Twenty-seven years later, some 90 countries have been represented through dance and music performed by more than 430 different artistic groups. In 1998, a shift began with the change of name, to upgrade the image of the event and also to expand the programming, and focus more and more on the younger public and families. Immersed in an ocean of summer festivals and attractions of all kinds, the Mondial des Cultures has managed to distinguish itself by its content and its product. Member of RÉMI (Regroupement des événements majeurs internationaux du Québec) since 1999, the organization played a key role in the biggest events in Québec.  The sites of the Mondial des Cultures  The Woodyatt Park, located in the heart of the City of Drummondville, is the historic place where all the festivities took place each summer. The variety of scheduled activities during the Mondial des Cultures all took place here. *The Grande Place SAQ: the main stage offered grand scale entertainment. It could accommodate more than 3,500 persons seated and 6,000 standing. Some thirty major productions took place at the Grande Place SAQ. *The Folkothèque Bluberi: 800 people were invited under a huge tent to join in an intimate encounter with folk dancers and musicians. Spectators were also invited to do a few dance steps with the performers. Over 55 interactive performances were held here through the 11-day festival. *The Pavillon des Cultures Loto-Québec was place where visitors could discover the customs and traditions, games, tasting of typical dishes, all this enticing the five senses. Visitors could participate to one of the 75 scheduled activities. *The Youth Area Hydro-Québec: especially designed for children 2 to 12 years old. This area provided games, makeup, tinkering, and board games. In addition, some twenty performances featuring the folk ensembles especially designed for the young ones took place during the festival. *Flavor’s All  The artists  As of 2009, 92 countries had been represented at the Mondial des Cultures with over 430 dance artistic groups and 25,000 artists. Several major artists performed on center stage such as Corneille, Zachary Richard, la Compagnie Créole or Grégory Charles.

History Hezekiah Barnes built the Stagecoach Inn in Charlotte, Vermont, in 1783. A former captain in the United States Militia, Barnes had moved with his family to Charlotte in 1780 and established the inn and a trading post on opposite sides of the main stage route from Montreal to southern New England. Built on a Georgian plan, the Stagecoach Inn, which town residents referred to as the Tavern Stand, possesses regularly spaced windows and two central, side-lit doors that are distinctive elements of the vernacular Federal style popular in the eighteenth century. =Relocation= When the Shelburne Museum dismantled and reassembled the Stagecoach Inn on the grounds in 1949, it needed restoration. Museum contractors removed the dividing walls in the second-story ballroom, returning it to its former dimensions; they rebuilt ten fireplaces, two brick ovens, and two ham-smoking chambers; applied paneling and plaster finishes that approximated those found in New England in the late 18th century; and fashioned replacement window casings and chair rails with antique carpenter's planes. Finally, they reconstructed the broad porch that had originally wrapped around the building's exterior to re-create the inn's early appearance. Collection =Trade and tavern signs= Shelburne Museum's collection of over 175 trade signs represents dozens of different trades using a variety of forms, such as oversized locksmith's keys, optometrist's eyeglasses and skate-maker's skates, as well as an enormous cobbler's boot, a haberdasher's hat, a clockmaker's watch, and an innkeeper's pineapple. Samuel Anderson Robb's firm produced several of the museum's finest figures, including a caricature of Robb in his National Guard uniform. Inspired by the popular Civil War-era song \\"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines\\", Thomas White, Robb's partner of many years, created the caricature as a tobacconist figure. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, trade signs advertised the variety of goods and services that craftspeople, merchants, and inn and tavern keepers offered. Many early craftspeople promoted their wares with oversized, three-dimensional metal or wooden representations of the objects they made or repaired. A gunsmith, for example, might hang a large gun outside his shop, while a dentist might exhibit a tooth. Inn and tavern keepers tended to favor flat, wooden signs that hung at a right angle to the building. These two-dimensional advertisements frequently combined a representational painting with the proprietor's name, and each side often displayed a different design. Although a few craftsmen made their own signs, many turned to professional carvers and sign painters. During the nineteenth century most major cities supported dozens of woodcarvers and sign painters. In 1881, Samuel Robb of New York advertised his firm's services thus: \\"Manufacturing of show figures and lettered signs a specialty. Tobacconist signs in great variety, on hand and made to any design. Ship and steamboat carvings, eagles, scroll heads, block letters, shoe, dentist, and druggist signs, etc.\\"Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. =Weathervanes and whirligigs= Shelburne Museum's collection of 130 weathervanes includes finely crafted vanes as well as commercially produced examples. The tradition of surmounting buildings with weathervanes extends to antiquity when, as early as 100 BCE, a vane crowned the Athenian Tower of the Winds. Throughout the Medieval period, European churches displayed roosters, symbols of vigilance, from their bell towers. By the seventeenth century, English settlers had brought the tradition to America. In the United States, weathervanes first decorated public buildings but soon appeared across the countryside. Farmers would mount a representation of a cow, pig, or rooster on top of their barns to symbolize their trade, while horse breeders might cap their stables with a finely crafted racehorse. Early weathervanes were often handmade, and the museum's wooden mermaid, carved by Warren Gould Roby of Wayland, Massachusetts, in about 1850, is a fine example of such hand-carved figures. Other handcrafted weathervanes include a Native American archer, a streamlined goose in flight, and a wooden rooster that originally stood on a barn in Bedford, Massachusetts. In the second half of the nineteenth century, manufacturers began to sell commercially produced, copper weathervanes. Makers of these vanes would hammer copper sheeting into cast-iron molds copied from carved-wood patterns. Using a mold enabled manufacturers to reproduce each design many times. Shelburne's collection includes finished copper vanes, cast-iron molds, and a unique wooden pattern for a Lady Liberty weathervane. Many of the commercial weathervanes depict common barnyard animals, including roosters, horses, pigs, and cows. Others represent less familiar forms such as a centaur, a pouter pigeon, and an anvil. One of the largest known commercial weathervanes is a highly detailed fire-pumper pulled by a pair of horses, which originally topped a firehouse in Manchester, New Hampshire. Whirligigs, which are closely related to weathervanes, most commonly represent a standing figure with paddled arms that flail in the wind. Some clever craftspeople built more complex whirligigs powered by a wind-catching wheel. One of Shelburne's finest represents a woman seated at a spinning wheel; doubling as a trade-sign, when the wind turned the spinning wheel, the woman's foot would move up and down on the treadle as if she were spinning yarn.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. Other =Stagecoaches= A stagecoach is a type of four- wheeled coach used for passengers and goods. They were strongly sprung and drawn by four horses. Stagecoaches were widely used before the introduction of railway transport and made regular trips between stages or stations, which were places of rest provided for stagecoach travelers. Shelburne Museum has examples of stagecoaches in their coach and wagon collection. See Horseshoe Barn and Annex for more information on this collection. =Stagecoach inns= Stagecoach inns served the traveling coach passengers. They stabled the teams of stagecoach horses, provided overnight loading, and served food and drink for weary travelers. References *Stagecoach Inn *Hill, Ralph Nading, and Lilian Baker Carlisle.

History Nakuru High School is one of Kenya's National Schools located in Nakuru Town, off Nakuru-Bahati Road. It borders Nakuru State House to the East. The school was founded in 1927 as Francis Scott High School but later renamed to Nakuru High School after Kenya attained independence in 1963. The first stone was laid by the then colonial governor Edward William Macleay Grigg. It has roughly 200 acres of land facing Menengai Crater. Initially the co-educational institution was reserved for children of the whites who lived in the outlying farming areas and British administrators. All teachers, masters (as they were called at the time) were also white. First formed as a boarding school, it still allowed day pupils (day-bugs) on condition that they lived around the school. By the late 1950s, the school had grown to have a swimming pool, numerous rugby pitches, basketball courts, football pitches, hockey and cricket fields. The school also had well equipped learning resources. It had fully furbished classrooms, and science laboratories. Unique was the weather station where geography students took practical lessons. To keep up with its fast pace of growth, a large contingent of residential subordinate staff was employed. After Kenya's Independence in 1963, gradual changes followed including the school being renamed and the first admissions of children of African origin. The first black students who pioneered entry to the school suffered harsh racial discrimination from students of Asian descent. In 1964 the school was opened to girls, making it the only national co-educational school in the whole country. A few years later, black teachers were employed, and in 1982 the first black principal, Francis Kesui, was appointed to the school. The school has consistently produced notable leaders, scholars, actors and countless professionals, considering its impressive performance in National Examinations. The school employs a holistic approach of child development where emphasis is put not only academic performance but also to co-curricular activities like swimming, martial arts, rugby, and drama. Rugby is a signature game for Nakuru High School. Multiple times has it dominated provincial rugby competition but has faced stiff competition at national level lately, despite having bagged the National and East Africa titles in 2004 and 2005 consecutively. Two schools in one Before the school was split, it had the largest number of students in the country one stream having seven or eight classes each with students not less than 50 so that each year a class had between 300 and 450 students - a number equivalent to a whole school in most places. By mid-2000 this uncontrolled admission led to leaders calling for its split along gender lines. It was also arguable that despite being mixed, girls had their own classes and dining hall. The aim was to reduce the number to ease management and to subsequently improve academic performance. In 2006 the school was split into the current Nakuru Boys High School and Nakuru Girls High School. Both schools have since recorded noticeable improvement in KCSE performance School motto Diligentia Servo which translates to \\"Learn To Serve\\" Academics Nakuru High School is categorised as a national school, meaning it recruits students who do well from all over Kenya according to the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education(KCPE). The old education system (O-Level and A-Level System) consisted from first forms to sixth forms but after changes occurred it changed to first to fourth forms. The school offers a wide range of subjects which are all examinable in the final exam (KCSE) Maths English Kiswahili Physics Chemistry Biology Geography History Religious Education which are all mandatory during the first two yrs. Other subjects are Business German French and Music Woodwork Computer Metalwork.

The publication was interrupted by World War I in 1914 and was only resumed in 1918. With the invasion of the Red Army into the Democratic Republic of Georgia the newspaper had to cease publication. In October 1994 the Kaukasische Post resumed publication and is since then published bi-monthly in Tbilisi and is the only German language newspaper in the Caucasus region.

He formulated an important theological rationale for peaceful coexistence with the non-Muslim ruling classes called the Suwarian tradition, which survives to this day despite the pressures of modernism. Background The spread of Islam throughout West Africa was a concomitant of long-distance trade by Mande-speaking Muslim traders and craftsmen known as Dyula. Since Muslims in these regions lived in the dar al- kufr (House of Unbelievers), they needed legitimization for trading with unbelievers – an activity viewed with disdain by some North African Muslim jurists. Sheikh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari focused on providing a solution to this and other related issues. Hailing from the Sahelian town of Ja (Dia) in the core Mali area, Al-Hajj Salim Suwari had performed the pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in residing in \\"pagan\\" lands (dar al-kufr). Suwarian tradition Sheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of Dyula minorities residing across West Africa into something dubbed the Suwarian tradition. It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers, and so justified a separation of religion and politics. The Suwarian prescription for peaceful coexistence involved seven main precepts: (a) unbelievers are ignorant, not wicked: (b) it is Allah's design that some people remain ignorant longer than others: (c) Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to non- Muslims around them, so they will know how to behave when they are converted: (d) they could accept the jurisdiction of non-Muslim authorities, as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith in accordance with the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammed. In this teaching Suwari followed a strong predilection in Islamic political philosophy for any government, albeit non-Muslim or tyrannical, as opposed to none: (e) The military jihad was a resort only in self-defense if the faithful were threatened. (f) Suwari discouraged dawah (proselytizing), instead contending that Allah would bring non-Muslims to Islam in His own way; it was not a Muslim's responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief: (g) Muslims must ensure that, by their commitment to education and learning, they keep their observance of the Law free from error.See Wilks in Levtzion and Pouwels 2000:98 =Influence of the Suwarian tradition= Suwarians articulate an ideological level, without straying from orthodoxy, the peculiarities of the situation in which Muslims found themselves in the period following the collapse of imperial Mali. Described by author Nehemia Levtzion as \\"accommodationist Islam\\", it created a praxis to enable Muslims to function within essentially non-Muslim societies, accommodating their interests to those of the wider society while at the same time combating erosion of their distinctive Muslim identity.N. Levtzion, Eighteenth Century Renewal & Reform in Islam, Syracuse University Press, 1987, p. 21. Since their form of Islam was capable of accommodating traditional cults, the dyula often served as priests, soothsayers and counselors at the courts of animist rulers.Launay, R., Beyond the Stream: Islam & Society in a West African Town. Berkeley, 1992 The Suwarian tradition was a realistic rationale for Muslims living in the woodland and forest regions of West Africa over the past five or six centuries. It was not without tension that came in part from the missionary dimension of Islam itself; it was challenged by Muslim reformers in recent centuries. Its neat compartments were obscured by occasional intermarriage between merchants and rulers. But the Suwarian tradition was resilient and useful, and it is probably similar to the positions of many African Muslim communities who found themselves in situations of inferior numbers and force, took advantage of their networks for trade, and enjoyed good relations with their \\"pagan\\" hosts.David Robinson, Muslim Societies in African History Spread of the Suwarian school Al-Hajj Salim's scholarly activity was centered on the town of Jagha in the bilâd as-sûdân (Western Sudan), but his influence was greatest along the southern fringes of the Manding trade network, and corresponds to the period of the disintegration of the old Malian empire. From the accounts of Ivor Wilks and Lamin Sanneh it is difficult to date the lifespan of Salim Suwari. Wilks dates his life around the late 15th century, while Sanneh thinks he lived two centuries earlier, around the late 13th century. Differences notwithstanding, Wilks intimates that his teachings were nurtured by his followers in Niger, Senegal and middle section of the Niger river from where they conveyed the tradition to the Voltaic region in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Wilks describes it as \\"pacifistic and quietist in content,\\" implying a tolerant and respectful approach to non- Muslims, while in the words of Sanneh, one of the imperatives of the tradition is its \\"travel or mobility (al-safar) involving the penetration of distant lands for the purposes of religion.\\"See Wilks, \\"Wa and the Wala,\\" p. 98, and also Sanneh, \\"The Crown and the Turban,\\" p. 37 Scholarly legacy The Suwari school of thought was a scholarly discipline that enjoyed a substantial number of ulema as well as a long history among West African Muslims. Ivor Wilks observes that \\"almost all of the asanid, scholarly chains owned by Muslim scholars of Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso converge on the highly revered figure of Kong Liman Abbas\\" whose own chain can be traced backwards \\"in twelve teaching generations to Al-Hajj Salim Suwari.\\" Wilks traces a long chain of scholars and students that passed through the tradition of Suwari, ranging from Saghanugu Liman of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), Ibrahim bin al- Mustapha of Wa, Ghana, Al-Amin bin Muhammad al-Abyad Kulibali of Kong, Côte d'Ivoire to Sa’id bin Abd al-Qadir, of Wa. It may not be stretching the point to suggest that the same tradition of ulema, especially the Kamaghaté, Wattara of the Soninke Wangara patronym, were the influential Muslims and traders in Kumasi in the years before the late 1890s when the Hausa Muslims migrated in large waves to Kumasi after the collapse of Salaga. It is probable that the Suwari tradition swept through greater parts of the Ghanaian Muslim communities – Wenchi, Wa, Gonja, Dagbon, and among some of the Kumasi Muslims, excluding the Hausas and other Muslims of Nigerian origin. And His great grandson Shiek Alhaj Baba Suwari of Wenchi in Ghana also contributed to massive spread of Islam in the sub-region. The Jakhanke people also trace their spiritual ancestry to al-Hajj Salim Suwari, and since they believed that the spirits of dead saints kept guard over their followers and interceded for them before Allah, the graves of al-Hajj Salim and other great teachers were centers for pilgrimage.Ira M.

Chilanko Forks is the location of the offices of the Alexis Creek First Nation. History From its opening in 1907 until its closing in 1918, the post office at this location was spelled \\"Chilanco Forks\\", as was also the spelling on Joseph Trutch's 1871 map of British Columbia. The community was once also the off base living area for a US airbase (917th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron - Pinetree Line 1952-1963) then, after the US withdrawal, an RCAF base (Squadron 55 - 1963-1966). Sawmill workers (1963–1971) also lived there until mill operations ceased though steady changes in logging operations meant constantly fluctuating population numbers for Chilanko Forks, at least along the roads near to, or leading to, the airbase. Beginning in 1963 Pinnette and Therrien of Williams Lake began logging operations around nearby Puntzi Lake and a portable mill was used throughout the area. Eventually sited at the extreme eastern end of the lake, the operation ran until August 1964 when it relocated to a spot about fifty kilometers back north into the bush at Chezacut. Following a particularly severe winter, with temperatures as extreme as 70 degrees F below zero, Pinnette and Therrien transferred their operation back to Chilanko Forks. The mill was then situated at the junction of the old highway and the base access road near Skinner Bridge (a name which has since evolved into Skinny Bridge - even though the bridge itself no longer exists). Relocation was undertaken in March 1965. It was at this time that Pinnette and Therrien phased out its logging operation in the area in favour of contracting the work to Illnicki Logging of Williams Lake. In 1966 a planer mill was added to the operation. In 1971 operations ceased following a mill fire. Each of the above changes/developments had significant effects on the size of the population of Chilanko Forks. The size of the aboriginal population was not impacted by these events. Currently the area nearest the airstrip is clustered along two main roads that lead off the highway, and other various loops and a branch road while one of the roads originally surveyed in 1963 has (East of Puntzi Airport Road) reverted to bush. Outlying ranches and the main Aboriginal settlement are important. There has been some expansion near Redstone Reserve and a satellite community has grown up just east of the main area (situated on what was once a gathering place and ball field). Dial phone systems began operating in the community on July 27, 1988. The current Chilanko Forks 'centre' has been relocated (there is a cut off loop from the highway that passes the old location). Climate Chilanko Forks has a subarctic climate in spite of its low latitude and position far to the west on the North American mainland. The climate of Chilanko Forks, and indeed much of the Chilcotin experiences extremely cold temperatures from time to time. Although the average temperature during the winter would be considered mild on the Prairies, extreme cold snaps can drop the temperature down to values not typically found south of the Yukon. The weather station at the nearby Puntzi airbase recorded in December 1968. Even Yellowknife has never been this cold. Due to the very dry air, clear skies, lack of wind, and geography, Chilanko Forks has one of the highest diurnal temperature variations in Canada, and the highest variation in British Columbia. The diurnal temperature variation in both February and May is the highest in Canada. The all-time high temperature of was set on August 11th, 2014.

Name He was baptized Cady Herrick, but his father thought it better to add an initial hyphened \\"D-\\" to the name to avoid class-room jokes, like calling the boy \\"Katie.\\" Thus the initial did not stand for any given name, and the first name should be pronounced \\"Dee-CAY-dee.\\" The press took a long time to get aware of the rather elaborate construction of the name, and printed mostly D. Cady Herrick, the initial with a period, which led to the general belief that the initial stood indeed for an abbreviated first name. Many people thought it was \\"Daniel,\\" after Daniel Cady, and The New York Times printed in 1904 \\"Donald\\" Cady Herrick as the Democratic nominee for governor. He was not the first New York politician to use an extra \\"D\\" which did not stand for any name, Daniel D. Tompkins added the middle initial to distinguish himself from another Daniel Tompkins while studying at Columbia College. Life He born on April 12, 1846, in Esperance, Schoharie County, New York, the son of Assemblyman Jonathan R. Herrick (1818–1890) and his first wife Harriet E. (Deuel) Herrick (1825–1856). In 1852, the family removed to Albany, New York. He graduated from the Albany Classical Institute, and then studied law in the office of Lyman Tremain and Rufus W. Peckham, Sr.. They sent him to Albany Law School where he was a classmate of William McKinley. He graduated in 1868, and was admitted to the bar. In 1874, he married Orissa H. Salisbury (d. 1925), and they had three children. In 1877, Herrick was defeated for District Attorney of Albany County, but in 1880 was re-nominated and elected, and he was re-elected in 1883. He became the chief lieutenant of Daniel Manning, the Democratic boss of Albany. When Manning moved to Washington, D.C. to serve as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in 1885, Herrick became the Democratic boss of Albany and continued in this role even after becoming a judge on the New York Supreme Court. In 1886, Herrick resigned as district attorney, and became Corporation Counsel of Albany. In 1888, he was permanent chairman of the Democratic state convention. In 1891, he was elected to a fourteen-year term on the New York Supreme Court (3rd District), defeating Republican John T. McDonough. He sat on the Appellate Division (Third Department) from 1896 to 1900. In 1891, he fined the members of the State Board of Canvassers, all Democrats, for their certification of the election returns from Dutchess County, which gave the 15th District seat in the New York State Senate to Democrat Edward B. Osborne, and enabled Democrats to gain control of the State Senate. In 1897, he overruled the Republican Secretary of State John Palmer's decision to certify the nomination of a candidate for Chief Judge by the \\"United Democracy\\". In 1904, he was nominated for Governor of New York, and resigned from the bench. He was defeated by Republican Frank W. Higgins, and afterwards resumed the practice of law at Albany and New York City. He was buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York. State Senator Walter R. Herrick (born 1877) was his half- brother.

Edward Jorden (1569 - 1632) was the first English physician who viewed the women who were accused of witchcraft as unfortunate persons suffering from some medical condition. Asserting that there were natural causes for their afflictions, Jorden often served as expert witness at trials of women accused of witchery. His arguments did not always persuade the judges, however. One Elizabeth Jackson, accused of causing the fits suffered by May Glover, was convicted in spite of Jorden's defense. Jorden (1603) called the disorder manifested in Jackson (and in the majority of supposed witches) by two terms: hysterical, and strangulatus uteri, or \\"suffocation of the mother\\" (mother here being an old-fashioned term for the uterus), since a choking in the throat was a common accompaniment. Jorden was impressed by the panoply and ever-shifting quality of symptoms associated with this condition: now shortness of breath, now palpitations, now paralysis, and so on. He was also aware that the hysterical \\"fits\\" might occur with varying regularity: yearly, monthly, or even weekly.\\"Edward Jorden and the Suffocation of the Mother Publications * A Briefe Discourse of a Disease called the Suffocation of the Mother by Edward Jorden, 1603 * A Discourse of Naturall Bathes, and Minerall Waters by Edward Jorden, 1631 References Category:1569 births Category:1633 deaths Category:English chemists Category:Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:People from Kent Category:16th-century English medical doctors Category:17th-century English medical doctors ","title":"Edward Jorden"},{"id":"23156842","text":"The Hong Kong Ice Hockey Association (HKIHA) is the governing body of ice hockey in Hong Kong.

In response to the campaign the team also received its first corporate sponsorship deal, with the Mahindra Group. The group's head, Anand Mahindra, tweeted that he had \\"decided to support these passionate athletes\\". Many of the members of the Indian national team, coordinated by the IHAI, are recruited from clubs associated with military units and regiments. The IHAI has however created programs to introduce the sport to a wider audience, for example through the Learn to Play programs that have been implemented in Ladakh and Kargil and soon will be in Delhi and Mumbai. As an alternative for players interested in the sport but who due to climate do not have access to outdoor ice rinks, the association will begin holding programs in in-line hockey as well. This will build on existing in- line hockey being played informally in Gujarat and Mumbai.

The exposed crib of the Stannard Rock Light is rated as one of the top ten engineering feats in the United States. It is from the nearest land, making it the most distant (from shore) lighthouse in the United States. It was one of the \\"stag stations\\", manned only by men, and had the nickname \\"The Loneliest Place in the World\\". The lighthouse was automated in 1962 and the United States Coast Guard still maintains it as an active aid to navigation. It is closed to the public and can only be viewed by boat or airplane. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Stannard Rock Reef The Stannard Rock Reef is located off Keweenaw Peninsula about south of Manitou Island and north of Marquette, Michigan. In 1835, Captain Charles C. Stannard of the vessel John Jacob Astor first discovered this underwater mountain that extends for with depths as shallow as and averaging . This reef was the most serious danger to navigation on Lake Superior and it was first marked by a day beacon in 1868, at which time tests were undertaken to determine if a light could survive in this harsh location, \\"atop a mile long reef\\" more than 50 miles northwest of Marquette. A temporary marker was placed at the location in 1866. The opening of the Soo Locks and the rapid increase in commerce between Duluth, Minnesota, and the lower Great Lakes demanded construction of a lighthouse. The lighthouse was named for Captain Stannard. The Stannard Rock Light is from the nearest land making it the most distant from shore of any lighthouse in the United States. Stannard Rock Reef provides a year-round structure for a superior lake trout fishery. Michigan's state record for lake trout, a specimen, was caught on line at Stannard Rock Reef by 16-year-old Lucas Lanczy on August 17, 1997. Construction Orlando Metcalfe Poe of the Lighthouse Board solved the logistics problem of constructing a lighthouse on the remote Stannard Rock Light by using the same process and all the apparatus and machinery used to build the tower and permanent protective crib of the Spectacle Reef Light on Lake Huron. The machinery included a steam and pulley operated cement mixer and a steam powered planing machine used to shape timbers. The brief season for work on the remote reef in Lake Superior lasted from May to October with many days lost to inclement weather. All of the machinery used to construct the Spectacle Reef Light was moved to the depot at Huron Bay on Lake Superior for construction of the crib for the Stannard Rock Light, which began in July 1877. Blocks of stone were cut at Marblehead, Ohio and shipped to the site for construction of the tower. The crib was taken out to Stannard Rock in August 1877, and soundings were made for fitting the crib to the reef. The crib was then returned to Huron Bay and built up to 14 courses; it was returned to Stannard Rock in August 1878 and placed in position on the reef. By October 1878 the crib was filled with concrete and stone from a quarry opened on Huron Island. By June 1879 an iron pier had been built up to the surface of the water. By mid-1880 the structure was above the water. The tower was completed and the first light was exhibited on July 4, 1882. Work on the tower continued until 1883. It took five years to complete the construction of the Stannard Rock Light at the cost of $305,000, (just $5,000 more than the original estimate) 126 tons of iron, 76 tons of brick, 1,270 tons of tower stone, and 7,276 tons of concrete were used in the lighthouse's construction. The exposed crib of the Stannard Rock Light is rated by the National Park Service as one of top ten engineering feats in the United States. It is said to be the farthest offshore of any lighthouse in the United States. \\"This is probably the most exposed of all Great Lakes lighthouses.\\" The light output varied from 156,000 to 248,000 candlepower over many years. Lighthouse service In early winter Lake Superior's waves splashing against the stone tower of the Stannard Rock Light built a layer of ice that forced maintenance crews to hack away the ice around the door to reach the men. If an illness, accident, or fire occurred at the Stannard Rock Light it could be days or even weeks before the keepers got assistance. As one of the rock lighthouses, it was designated as a \\"stag station\\" where only men could serve without their families. The keepers called the Stannard Rock Light the \\"Loneliest Place in the World\\" and it has always carried the distinction of being the \\"loneliest place\\" in the continental United States. Maritime historian Wes Oleszwski reported that duty at the Stannard Rock Light was so rough that of the keepers and assistant keepers, there were four resignations and three transfers in the first three seasons of the station's operation. The lighthouse keepers were taken off the Stannard Rock at the close of shipping season in early December. The towers were locked until the keepers returned in March for the start of the shipping season. Landing at the Stannard Rock Light was difficult, but often the more serious problem at the start of the season was the need to take sledgehammers and pickaxes to clear away layers of thick ice ( deep) on the entry door, lantern, and foghorns. The Stannard Rock Light keepers operated the lantern and the living quarters with flammable illuminants for 60 years; the lighthouse was not electrified until after World War II. It was just a few years after this that an explosion of gasoline and propane tanks used to fuel the station plant destroyed the buildings on the pier and severely damaged the interior of the tower. The explosion killed one keeper and left three others stranded on the concrete pier at the base of the tower for three days before a passing ship discovered them and notified the Coast Guard. The men were rescued by the tender Woodrush. After the accident, the Coast Guard repaired the fire damage, decided that the place was too remote and dangerous, and automated the station in 1962. The 1,400,000 candlepower light was replaced with a 3,000 candlepower light. The Coast Guard carefully disassembled the 2nd order, 12 bulls-eyed Fresnel lens, hauled it down 141 tower stairs, packed it in six wooden crates, and then lowered the crates by block and tackle down to the crib for shipment. After a protracted search, the Fresnel lens was found 37 years later at the Coast Guard Academy's storage warehouse in New London, Connecticut. The base unit for the lens was relocated from the tower to the museum in 2000. The lens is now on display at the Marquette Maritime Museum. See, Marquette Harbor Light. Double mission and current status The Stannard Rock Light remains the property of the Coast Guard as an active aid to navigation. The lighthouse can only be viewed by airplane or boat and it is closed to the public. After more than a century of warning mariners away from the treacherous reef, the lighthouse was given a new mission in 2008 when scientists placed equipment atop the tower to measure whether increased evaporation was the cause of receding Great Lakes water levels. Boat trips out to the lighthouse are available, although visitors are not allowed to enter it.

They were opposed to Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican friar who came to dominate Florentine religious life and politics in the 1490s. Along with Pope Alexander VI they were a crucial part of Savonarola's demise in the early spring of 1498. The Compagnacci were also known as the Rude, Rowdy or Ugly Companions. Their leader was a nobleman named Dolfo Spini. He was assisted in his opposition to Savonarola by two Medici brothers of the cadet branch, one of whom married a Sforza princess. The Compagnacci were dedicated pleasure seekers who dressed finely and partied with music as an accompaniment. Their influence was reinforced by support they picked up during street demonstrations. In time the Compagnacci won votes in the Great Council.Scourge and Fire, Lauro Martines, Jonathan Cape, 2006, pg. 155.

I volti segreti di Giotto (The secret sides of Giotto) “A wonderful intellectual adventure into the core of Giotto's inspiration and the amazing world of the Italian 14th century” (Antonia Arslan) This book is a journey into the symbolic universe of the painter who revolutionized the concept of space. The 14th century in Italy begins with the creation of two masterpieces: the first part of Dante's Divine Comedy, devoted to Hell, and the fresco cycle of the Scrovegni Chapel or Arena Chapel(1303–1305), both works marking the start of a new era. There are works that never stop challenging our minds; works that are not forgotten with the passing of time. In his book Giuliano Pisani takes us into the heart of one of the great masterpieces of Western art: the symbol-laden frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel. The book is a journey of discovery aimed at finding out again the pieces of a mosaic whose original meaning had been lost; deciphering the meaning of the allegories, and correcting some commonly accepted interpretations. In his frescoes Giotto shows man's salvation, a very complex project, following the guide lines from a hitherto unknown theologian who worked in the shadow: Alberto da Padova. New figures have been identified in a fundamental point of the cycle (Christ on the throne in the picture of the Final Judgement): a centaurus, a she-bear, a pike fish finally take the place of the figures that were formerly believed to symbolise the evangelists .

Andrew Cuomo as well as a former Chairman of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority. He resigned as Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 23, 2013, after nearly 10 years in the position following the Cuomo appointments. Kaiman was the Town's third Democratic Supervisor, following Ben Zwirn and May W. Newburger. North Hempstead is the seventh-largest municipality among 1,500 towns, cities and villages in the U.S. The Town Board elected John B. Riordan, the Town Attorney who had served as Nassau County Surrogate until 2011, to succeed Kaiman until Dec. 31, 2013. Riordan, also a Democrat, is not a candidate for the position. Kaiman had previously announced he would not run for a sixth term and was nominated as a candidate for the Nassau District Court. He later declined the nomination just before he was named to his New York state position. Kaiman, 51, implemented a number of innovative programs for North Hempstead. One, the first suburban 311 constituent-response system, fast-tracks public complaints, speeding up service to constituents and optimizing the workforce. In addition, Kaiman initiated Project Independence, a groundbreaking program designed to assist seniors who want to \\"age in place.\\" Kaiman was responsible for several environmental-friendly programs such as: North Hempstead's Townwide School Recycling Program, S.T.O.P. (Stop Throwing Out Pollutants/Pharmaceutical Collection Event), Operation Clean Sweep, and North Hempstead's Earth Day Program, including EcoFest. He also led North Hempstead to green its vehicle fleet by purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles for the town. Kaiman's tenure resulted in North Hempstead being ranked in Money 's 2008 listing of the \\"Best 100 Places to Live in America.\\" North Hempstead was the highest of three communities within New York state to be ranked on the list. Early career and background Kaiman, who grew up in New Jersey, is a longtime resident of Great Neck. He graduated from Hofstra University and Hofstra Law School. Kaiman was elected to the Nassau County District Court in 1999. As judge, he presided over criminal, civil, landlord/tenant, and municipal code cases. Serving only two years until his resignation, Kaiman received the highest rating from the Nassau County Bar Association's Judicial Screening Committee.

A native of Montreal, Canada, who grew up in Portland, Oregon, U.S. Gorenstein started painting as a teenager at a time when women artists weren't very well received. A reflection of the times in which she lived, she signed her work \\"Hilgos\\", an androgynous professional working name. She was later the inspiration for the documentary film, I Remember Better When I Paint. Career A graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the early 1930s, she produced more than 1,500 artworks in about 70 years including paintings in oil and acrylic, watercolors, drawings and sculpture. Hilgos's pieces have been exhibited in cities across the United States and her artwork is part of private collections in the U.S. and abroad. She was a marine artist who was selected to paint twelve murals for the U.S. Navy's exhibit in the Federal Building for the 1933–1934 International Exhibition Century of Progress, a World's Fair held in Chicago. Her frieze was composed of twelve murals depicting the influence of sea power on America, beginning with the settlement of Jamestown in 1607 when sea power first reached America and carrying through World War I. Later years In her later years while struggling with Alzheimer's, she stated \\"I remember better when I paint\\". With students from the Art Institute of Chicago facilitating, Hilgos began painting again. Painting allowed Hilgos to maintain, and even regain, some of her core identity, and her extraordinary enthusiasm and energy, in the face of her affliction. Many of these late-in-life pictures, most of which are watercolors, are exceptional. Her daughter, Berna Huebner, has written a book based on Hilgos describing how some people affected with dementia can be reconnected to themselves and their pasts with the help of art students who work with them in creating art. The Hilgos Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the artistic creation for people who have Alzheimer’s was founded in her memory. Film An international documentary film, I Remember Better When I Paint, inspired by Hilgos, focuses on how the creative arts can help Alzheimer's patients re-engage in life, not only through creation and performance of art and music but also from exposure to the arts around the world, such as the Louvre museum. It also shares findings by leading neurologists offering scientific support regarding the transforming power of the arts for Alzheimer's victims. The film includes an emotional interview with Yasmin Aga Khan, movie star Rita Hayworth‘s daughter; Hayworth developed early-onset Alzheimer’s and also painted. A French version of the film Je me souviens mieux quand je peins was released in September 2009 as part of the French Alzheimer Association's activities on World Alzheimer's Day. The film is co-directed by Berna Huebner and Eric Ellena. Extracts from the documentary were featured on the France 2 Telematin television program.

Sir John Moore Sir John Moore was second son of Charles Moore Esq., owner of Appleby Parva Manor (later demolished to create Appleby Hall). His elder brother, also called Charles, was expected to inherit the family estates; as second son, John, was expected to make his own way in the world. John went to London to make a living as a merchant. He made his fortune in the City of London, was knighted, became Lord Mayor of London in 1681 (during the reign of King Charles II) and eventually an Alderman of London.Appleby Magna - Sir John Moore School Moore had no children and, wishing to use his wealth to benefit his home village, financed the building of a school next to his father's estate. Moore commissioned Sir Christopher Wren to prepare the initial drawings. After Wren's first design, the work was taken on by local architect Sir William Wilson who both studied under Wren at Oxford University and worked for his Company. The school Construction started in 1693 and it opened in 1697. For most of its existence the school was known as \\"Appleby Grammar School\\" and operated as a free school for the boys of the village, as well as a boys' boarding school. The name was changed to \\"Sir John Moore Church Of England School\\" some time in the last century. It was also in the last century that the school started to accept girls. During the Second World War, the school was used to house Belgian evacuees (boys only). During the Second World War, it was said locally that the flames of Coventry, after it was bombed, could be seen from the roof of the school. In the mid-1990s, following rising maintenance costs, the school was earmarked for closure. A new school building was planned in a neighbouring field and the building was to be surrendered to the National Trust. After much protest from the villagers the school remained open. It received a £6,000,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to renovate the whole building. The stables were converted into a computer suite, the old dormitories were turned into a heritage centre and several old offices and storage rooms were converted into rented offices and apartments. The building still operates as a primary school, with 125 students from the village. It was described as \\"outstanding\\" in its June 2009 Ofsted inspection.

Map of Nurra. The Nurra is a geographical region in the northwest of Sardinia, Italy. It is the second largest plain of the island, located between the towns of Sassari, Porto Torres and Alghero. It covers a surface of 700 km² and is bounded by the Sardinian Sea on the west and by the Gulf of Asinara on the north. Nurra was once an important mining center, with Argentiera being the principal village, though today it is a ghost town. The Nurra, before the works of land reclamation initiated under Fascism (which were also continued in after World War II by the ETFAS, Ente Trasformazione Fondiaria Agricola Sarda), and despite being next to one of the most populated areas of Sardinia, has one of the lowest population densities in Italy, with 5 inhabitants per km², primarily, due to the drought and to the presence of malaria, eliminated only in the 20th century. History 250px In the Middle Age Nurra was a curatoria in the Giudicato di Torres, rich with salt mills and silver mines. From the 12th century it was owned by the Branca branch of the Doria family of Genoa, who had acquired it at the extinction of the giudicato family and kept it until the end between the Republic of Genoa and the Crown of Aragon in the 14th century. This was depopulated the area, and in 1347 many of the villages were reduced to ghost towns, and the remaining ones suffered equally in the subsequent war between Aragon and the Giudicato of Arborea. In 1391 it was again invaded by Brancaleone Doria. In 1427 it was formally given to the free commune of Sassari, but was still subject to raids from North-African corsairs. Heritage There is an example of industrial archaeology included in the Geological-Mining Park of Sardinia and preserved from UNESCO.

The coordinates of the school campus are: 0°19'42.0\\"N 32°36'59.0\\"E (Latitude:0.328333; Longitude:32.616389). History MUBS was established in the 1960s as National College of Business Studies (NCBS). It offered business and management diplomas as well as professional training in business. At that time, the college offered diplomas, the main ones being the Uganda Diploma in Business Studies and the Higher Diploma in Marketing. In 1997, Faculty of Commerce at Makerere University was merged with NCBS, thereby creating MUBS, a constituent college of Makerere University. The staff and students of both institutions were brought together at the campus at Nakawa, approximately , east of Kampala's central business district. In 2001, due to changes in the laws of Uganda, MUBS transformed from a constituent college of Makerere University to a \\"public tertiary institution\\" affiliated to Makerere University. However this arrangement did not work well, resulting in Makerere introducing competing duplicate courses at the main campus, while MUBS started to agitate for complete autonomy. Finally in 2012, the autonomy sought by MUBS was granted by the Uganda Ministry of Education and Sports. Autonomy In January 2012, Ugandan media reported that MUBS will break away from Makerere University and reconstitute itself into an independent university. This will result in the change of its name to a new name, yet to be determined. In August 2013, Uganda's Attorney General began drafting the necessary legislation to separate MUBS from Makerere University. The draft was expected to be presented to the Ugandan Parliament for debate and enactment into law.

Enlargement of this duct is one of the most common inner ear deformities and is commonly associated with hearing loss during childhood.. The term was first discovered in 1791 by Mondini when he was completing a temporal bone dissection. It was then defined by Valvassori and Clemis as a vestibular aqueduct that is greater than or equal to 2.0 mm at the operculum and/or greater than or equal to 1.0 mm at the midpoint. Some use the term enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome but this is felt by others to be erroneous as it is a clinical finding which can occur in several syndromes. Symptoms Although large vestibular aqueducts are a congenital condition, hearing loss may not be present from birth. Age of diagnosis ranges from infancy to adulthood, and symptoms include fluctuating and sometimes progressive sensorineural hearing loss and disequilibrium. It is possible that a small portion of those with large vestibular aqueducts will not exhibit auditory symptoms such as hearing loss. While this is uncommon, hearing loss can progress later in life especially after head trauma. Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and can be sensorineural, conductive, or mixed. Vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and imbalance, occur in adult patients 45% of the time. Pathology The cochlea and vestibule, viewed from above. (Aquaeductus vestibuli labeled at bottom right The vestibular aqueduct acts as a canal between the inner ear and the cranial cavity. Running through it is a tube called the endolymphatic duct, which normally carries a fluid called endolymph from the inner ear to the endolymphatic sac in the cranial cavity. When the endolymphatic duct and sac are larger than normal, as is the case in large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, endolymph is allowed to travel back from the endolymphatic sac into the inner ear. This often results fluctuations in hearing levels. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are caused by mutations in gene SLC26A4, which is also associated with Pendred's syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts often occur with other inner ear development problems, such as cochlear deformities. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are part of the classic Mondini deformity. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs occur in Pendred syndrome which is caused by a defect on chromosome 7q31.. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts can also occur in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, CHARGE syndrome and renal tubular acidosis. Enlarged vestibular aqueducts can be bilateral or unilateral. Hearing loss caused by large vestibular aqueduct syndrome is not inevitable, although people with the syndrome are at a much higher risk of developing hearing loss than the general population. Hearing loss is very likely. Diagnosis Enlarged vestibular aqueducts are commonly picked up after newborn hearing screen when a child is identified as having a hearing loss. The hearing loss is commonly mixed and can be of any degree when first identified. The conductive component is due to a third window effect caused by the widened vestibular aqueduct. During an audiologic assessment, an air-bone gap in the low frequencies can occur due to the enlarged vestibular aqueduct acting as a third mobile window. Hearing loss in the contralateral ear to the enlarged vestibular aqueduct can also occur due to the chemical composition on both sides. Torticollis has also been found to be an indicator of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct in children. Identification of the enlarged vestibular aqueduct in a child is usually by MRI scan which identifies the fluid within the endolymphatic duct and sac. CT scan may be needed to see the vestibular aqueduct clearly. In adults CT scan may be the first investigation. In order to diagnose the cause of the enlarged vestibular aqueduct the physician will need a detailed family history, full examination to include vestibular examination and, if a bilateral finding, molecular genetic testing as appropriate. With unilateral enlarged vestibular aqueducts molecular genetic testing is currently not recommended. Management There is no treatment to correct an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Any hearing loss will need management with amplification and support in education and at work. If the hearing loss becomes severe to profound, cochlear implants can be of significant value. Vestibular disturbance is usually short-lived and associated with head trauma but significant vestibular hypofunction may require rehabilitation. People with enlarged vestibular aqueducts are advised to avoid head trauma where possible. This usually means avoiding contact sports such as football, boxing, rugby, horse riding, trampolining and other sports where head injury may occur. Some have symptoms when flying and should limit these activities if affected.

He is an associate professor and department chair of Art Photography at the College of Visual and Performing Arts at Syracuse University. The bulk of DuBois' photography is portraiture, and he is well known for photographs of intimate familial scenes. He is among a group of contemporary American photographers, including Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Laurie Simmons, Cindy Sherman, and Tina Barney, whose re-imagined depictions of domestic spaces anticipated the transformations of family life among a \\"tidal wave of late-capitalist individualism and aspiration.\\" DuBois is a recipient of a 2012 Guggenheim Fellowship, and his work is in the collections of MoMA in New York, SFMOMA in San Francisco, LACMA and the Getty in Los Angeles, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Early life and education DuBois was born in Dearborn, MI and grew up in the suburban New Jersey community of Far Hills. As a teenager he began taking photographs with a rangefinder camera he found in his father's closet. He has a younger sister Lise and a younger brother, the composer R. Luke DuBois, who appear often in his early photographs. DuBois graduated from Hampshire College with a Bachelor of Arts if Film and Photography and subsequently received a Masters of Fine Arts in Photography from the San Francisco Art Institute. Photography In between his undergraduate and graduate educations, his father suffered a near-fatal fall from a commuter train and spent several years convalescing in the home, and DuBois documented this process as a \\"kind of emotional protection.\\" These family portraits formed the basis of a body of work surrounding his family that would continue for twenty-four years and eventually come to be published by Aperture as a photo-book titled All the Days and Nights. The photographs in this series document his changing family: his father's recovery from his injuries juxtaposed with the descent of his mother, his father's sole caretaker, into the depths of depression and mental illness, the subsequent dissolution of his parents' marriage, as well as the maturation of his brother and sister. DuBois's interest in the family, both his and others, is also evident in a subsequent photo series, \\"Avella,\\" which chronicles life in the deindustrialized coal-mining town of Avella, Pennsylvania, where his father grew up. To learn about his family's hometown DuBois would drive his grandmother around in his aunt's car while she identified local landmarks and told stories, often taking pictures as they traveled. He documents the decay and blight of the town, but also the families which live among such an environment of insularity and lack of opportunity. The photographs challenge American \\"myths\\" surrounding upward economic mobility and question how American families survive amid economic uncertainty. The themes of economic uncertainty and provincial life are likewise central to DuBois' recent photo series, which was published as the book My Last Day at Seventeen. These photographs depict working class teenagers in a housing estate in Cobh, County Cork, Ireland after the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. The series represents the anxiety inherent to the transition from adolescence to adulthood, and how the subjects' anxiety regarding the future is mirrored by their economic uncertainty. Shot over five summers, the series presents an \\"endless summer\\" in which precariously-situated teenagers perform identities informed by an international popular visual culture but mediated through a local context. DuBois carefully composes his compositions with supplementary lighting, and uses either a medium format or a large format folding camera with a cloak. He does not consider his work to be documentary, rather he views each photo as a collaborative endeavor between artist and subject which is based in truth. DuBois will often stage or recreate photographs, sometimes even alluding to visual works which are not his own, and has borrowed the literary term \\"creative nonfiction\\" to describe his work.

Singles like \\"Waqt\\", \\"Hamesha\\" and \\"Kahan Hai Tu\\" did well in the charts. Irtiqa was considered a critical and commercial success. Concept Irtiqa means 'progress' or 'evolution', and this album talks about progress in life. The cover of the album depicts a sketch of an unborn baby. The first track 'Irtiqa I' starts off the album with a soft voice of a newly born baby, indirectly pointing towards progress after birth. The songs that follow after are carefully composed and it seems that EP strictly means business. Songs like \\"Hamain Aazma\\" and \\"Kahan Hai Tu\\" sound somewhat similar as far as the beginning is concerned but as the tracks unfold either one follow their own unique blend of heavy guitar notes and drums. Most of the tracks do follow the heavy metal/progressive rock genre of music but a couple songs like \\"Waqt\\" and \\"Aghosh\\" take a slightly lighter tone while at the same time never losing their metallic touch. On the whole \\"Irtiqa\\" is not just a music album, it's a concept, it's a theme and not many musicians in Pakistan making music is based on a specific theme or subject and be able to maintain that theme throughout the album but not just in a single song.

The mission school was commonly used in the colonial era for the purposes of Westernization of local people. These may be day schools or residential schools (as in the Canadian Indian residential school system). Mission schools were established in India as early as the 16th century. They eventually appeared on almost every continent, and persisted in some regions to the late 20th century. These schools often adopted an evangelical and \\"heavily denominational\\" approach to religious education, with the intention of producing new teachers and religious leaders to propagate Christianity among the local population. They also provided academic and vocational training, and usually discouraged the traditional practices of the local people. Mission schools were sometimes government-funded, for example in the US \\"when Congress felt less inclined to provide the large sums of money needed to establish government schools\\" to educate the American Indian population.

It is located south-southeast of Coulterville, at an elevation of 2054 feet (626 m). Bear Valley was designated California Historical Landmark #331. The population was 125 at the 2010 census. The place was originally called Haydenville in honor of David, Charles, and William Hayden, gold miners. The place later bore the names Biddle's Camp and Biddleville in honor of William C. Biddle. It later was named Simpsonville in honor of Robert Simpson, local merchant. The name Johnsonville honored John F. Johnson. The name became Bear Valley in 1858. The Haydenville post office opened before January 21, 1851 and closed in 1852. The Bear Valley post office operated from 1858 to 1912, from 1914 to 1919, and from 1933 to 1955. In 1847, John C. Frémont, a veteran of the Bear Flag Revolt, decided to settle down in the San Francisco Bay Area. Desiring a ranch near San Jose, California, he sent $3,000 to the American consul Thomas O. Larkin. Instead of his intended purchase, he was sold Rancho Las Mariposas, consisting of in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills around Bear Valley.John C. Frémont, sierrafoothillmagazine.com, Accessed August 2, 2009. The original Mexican grant was a \\"floating grant\\", a grant of land for which the area was precisely given but the actual boundaries were left unspecified (usually due to inadequate surveys of the areas involved). After the beginning of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Fremont moved his grant's borders into the hills. Those hills proved to be lucrative and his mining operations centered in Bear Valley. At its peak, Bear Valley had a population of 3,000. During 1850-60 when Frémont's Pine Tree and Josephine Mines were producing, Frémont built an elegant hotel, Oso House; the structure, like many in the area, burned in the late 19th century. Frémont lived and worked in the city, and his large home was nicknamed the Little White House, coincidentally built two years after he was the first Republican Party candidate for US President; the home burned in 1866.

Alan Ranta of PopMatters gave the album 8 stars out of 10, saying: \\"It is too intelligent and challenging to the status quo for the mainstream media to truly embrace, and Anti- seems to be lacking a little on the side of their hip-hop promotion department.\\" Mosi Reeves of Spin gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: \\"Extraordinarily irrational and willfully convoluted, Jhelli Beam is avant-rap as quantum physics.\\" The opening track, \\"Split Seconds (Between Nannies and Swamis)\\", was described by Thomas Quinlan of URB as \\"Busdriver's simplest, most accessible rap jam, eschewing the bursts of rapid rap flows that usually accompany his slower style, and only occasionally bringing in a bit of sing-song.\\" He gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying: \\"While there's some experimentation with new ideas here, Jhelli Beam is familiar enough to leave Busdriver fans more than satisfied.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from liner notes. * Busdriver – vocals, production (3, 11, 12, 14) * Nosaj Thing – production (1) * Omid – production (2, 10) * Nobody – production (3, 6, 9) * AntiMC – glockenspiel (3), electric guitar (4), bass guitar (8) * Shawn Lee – string arrangement (3) * Everton Nelson – violin (3) * Warren Zielenski – violin (3) * John Metcalfe – viola (3) * Ian Burge – cello (3) * Daedelus – production (4, 7, 11, 13) * Nocando – vocals (5) * Free the Robots – production (5) * Greg Saunier – production (8) * Myka 9 – vocals (9) * Leticia – additional instrumentation (10) * Create(!) – additional instrumentation (10) * Nick Thorburn – vocals (11) * John Dieterich – guitar (13), bass guitar (13), soundscape (13) * Trevor Hernandez – artwork, design * Bryan Sheffield – photography References Further reading * External links * Category:2009 albums Category:Busdriver albums Category:Anti- (record label) albums ","title":"Jhelli Beam"},{"id":"23157670","text":"This is a list of villages in Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria. *Brestovitsa *Bryagovo *Byala Reka *Dragoynovo *Ezerovo *Graf Ignatievo *Hrabrino *Iskra *Kalekovets *Kaloyanovo *Kosovo *Krumovo *Narechen *Parvenets *Radinovo *Razhevo *Skutare *Slatina *Starosel *Suhozem *Tsaratsovo *Voisil *Voynyagovo *Voyvodino See also *List of villages in Bulgaria Plovdiv ","title":"List of villages in Plovdiv Province"},{"id":"23157677","text":"Ego… Ichografisis 1957 - 1995 (Marinella: The very best of EMI years) (Greek: Εγώ… Ηχογραφήσεις 1957 - 1995; ) is a compilation of recordings by popular Greek singer Marinella, under the EMI series Capitol Original Masters.

Early life Ludovic Trarieux was born on 30 November 1840 in Aubeterre-sur-Dronne (Charente). He was called to the Bar of Bordeaux in 1862 and practiced there until 1881. He was elected President of the Bar in 1877, at the age of thirty-seven and became a member of the local republican party. Political life On 6 April 1879 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and became a member of the Opportunist Republican parliamentary group, Gauche républicaine, where he was quickly noticed, making numerous interventions in debates. Nevertheless, his stay in power was short-lived. He approved the bill on the liberty of higher education, while supporting various amendments. He also voted for the invalidation of the election of Auguste Blanqui and against the plenary amnesty on cases concerning The Paris Commune. In the debate on the status of professional trade unions (that was finally voted in 1884), he intervened to seek guarantees. Beaten in the new elections in 1881, he was called to the Parisian bar and pursued his political career there. He was elected Senator of the Gironde on 5 January 1888, then re-elected in 1897, remaining in the post until his death. As a member of the Republican Left and soon President of the group of the Moderate Left (the most moderate in the High Assembly), at first he adopted some very conservative positions in cases on social laws (modification of article 1780 concerning service contracts, arbitration between employers and employees, the work of women and juveniles) and, in his report, rejected the bill of modification of the law on professional trade unions. He distinguished himself, especially in 1893 and 1894, as the reporter on the voting of three of the four laws aimed at the repression of anarchist attacks (the famous \\"lois scélérates\\"). However, he fought energetically against an amendment that aimed to transfer infringements concerning the detention of explosives to the War Council, which had become more repressive, since it had refused to allow the removal of common law jurisdiction from these courts. In the same vein, on 28 May 1897, he pushed for the voting of the law that put an end to secret investigations in the absence of a lawyer, and fought for the institution of a system of competing experts in criminal matters, comparable to the adversarial system. In 1889, he was chosen by his peers of the Senate to become a member of the Commission of the Nine, in charge of the instruction of the lawsuit against General Boulanger. The Dreyfus affair On 26 January 1885 he became Minister of Justice. He adopted a law that allowed more extensive opportunities of appeal in criminal cases, better compensation for injury suffered by victims of miscarriages of justice, and came up against a \\"legal event\\" that had just rocked France: one cold day, twenty-one days earlier, Captain Alfred Dreyfus had been convicted of treason, dishonourably discharged and, since 18 January, had been waiting on Ile de Re to be transported to Devil's Island in French Guiana. However, since his conviction in 1894, Dreyfus and his family had not stopped protesting his innocence. His conviction had been pronounced in camera, with the help of false secret documents which had not been communicated to the defence. Very few people at this time were convinced of Dreyfus' innocence. The case was closed and the Dreyfus affair had not yet begun. While Minister of Justice, Trarieux obtained copies of Dreyfus' writing and discovered discrepancies between the convict's handwriting and that of the author of the document that had established his guilt. Besides, one of Dreyfus’ lawyers, M. Demange, had come to reveal to him that a secret document had been communicated to the War Council unknown to the defence. After his departure from the Chancery, (10 November 1895), Trarieux sacrificed his professional and his political career to becoming the untiring defender of the innocence of Captain Dreyfus. On 7 December 1897 Trarieux was the only Senator to support Dreyfus' defender Auguste Scheurer-Kestner and praise his civic courage. When evidence pointed to Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy as the real guilty party, Esterhazy himself asked to be tried by a military court. Just before Esterhazy’s trial on 8 January 1898, Trarieux published an open letter in \\"Le Temps\\", addressed to the War Minister, Billot, to denounce \\"the parody of justice\\". Esterhazy was acquitted. In the trial of Émile Zola following his accusations against the army, Trarieux was an essential witness for the defence. He recounted evidence that he had collected, revealing what he had discovered concerning essential documents and explaining how he had become convinced that Esterhazy was guilty. As a former Minister of Justice, his support was much appreciated by Dreyfus' supporters. Trarieux was a witness in Dreyfus's second trial in Rennes, from 7 August to 9 September 1899. Though reducing the sentence, the War Council in Rennes convicted Dreyfus a second time. Trarieux remarked, \\"Our defeat is of the kind that does not discourage, but foster courages and give grandeur to certain situations\\". He then challenged the Senate to pardon Dreyfus, in the name of justice, though initially this was only granted on the nominal grounds of the convict's ill health. This was pronounced by President Emile Loubet, in September 1899. A full amnesty followed in June 1900, granted by the Waldeck-Rousseau government, in order to calm the situation down. League of Human Rights Between two hearings of the Zola case, on 17 or 18 February, at the tenth or eleventh hearing, Trarieux thought about creating the Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, \\"Human Rights League\\") On 20 February 1898 a first meeting took place in his home, at 4 Logelbach Street. After several months of tireless activity, having united the support of a thousand people, Trarieux and his friends convened a general assembly, in the hall of the \\"Sociétés Savantes\\", in Paris.Bertrand Favreau (ed), \\"Dreyfus réhabilité, cent ans après - Antisémitisme: il y a cent ans, et aujourd'hui...\\", Éditions Le Bord de l'eau, 2007. It was there that, on 4 June 1898, was finally formed the Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, \\"Human Rights League\\"), of which Trarieux was proclaimed President and entrusted with the drawing up of its statutes. On 4 July 1898 the first manifesto of the League of Human Rights proclaimed: \\"from this day, anyone whose liberty is threatened or whose rights are violated can be ensured of obtaining help and assistance from us\\". On 20 August 1898, after the humiliating arrest of Dreyfus supporter Colonel Georges Picquart, found \\"guilty – of having denounced the Henry forgery\\", on the orders of Jacques Cavaignac, the War Minister, Trarieux wrote another open letter to Cavaignac, and distributed 400 000 copies of it all over France. Cavaignac had to resign on 5 September 1898 and nearly one year day-for-day after the constitution of the League of Human Rights, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court quashed the Dreyfus judgment of 1894 and referred the case to the War Council in Rennes. He continued to develop the Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, \\"Human Rights League\\"), that soon had several tens of thousands of members. Final years Exhausted by his efforts and by ill health, in 1903, he was forced to hand over the presidency of the League of Human Rights to his friend, Francis de Pressensé. Until his death, he dedicated his last efforts to Dreyfus' rehabilitation, (which he did not live to see, since it took place on 12 July 1906) and to the defence of human rights. He died on 13 March 1904 in his Parisian apartment at 4 Rue de Logelbach. The \\"Ludovic- Trarieux International Human Rights Prize\\" Created in 1984, in Bordeaux by the French lawyer Bertrand Favreau, \\"The Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize\\" is awarded each year to a lawyer, regardless of nationality or Bar, who, by his work, has demonstrated through his work or experiences, the defence of human rights, of defence rights, the supremacy of law, the struggle against racism and intolerance in any form. The prize-winner is chosen after consulting humanitarian associations and NGOs. The Prize, also called \\"The international tribute from Lawyers to a Lawyer\\", is presented in partnership by the Human Rights Institute of The Bar of Bordeaux, the Human Rights Institute of the Bar of Paris, the Human Rights Institute of The Bar of Brussels, l'Unione forense per la tutela dei diritti dell'uomo (Roma) and the European Bar Human Rights Institute (IDHAE) whose members are the biggest European law societies fighting for human rights such as Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA), Rechtsanwaltskammer Berlin, Ordre français des Avocats du barreau de Bruxelles, barreau de Luxembourg or Polish National Council of the Bar (Warsaw). The first Ludovic Trarieux Prize was awarded on 29 March 1985 to Nelson Mandela, then in jail. It was officially handed over to his daughter, Zenani Mandela Dlamini, on 27 April 1985.

Toy Shop houses 19th- and early 20th-century playthings, including miniature transportation toys, penny banks, and music boxes.http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=30 History The Shelburne Museum built the Toy Shop in the early 1950s as an extension to Variety Unit. Built in 1835, Variety Unit, the only structure original to the Museum grounds, is an example of “continuous” architecture common to New England farmhouses. As more space was needed, farmers added new wings to their house. Farmers would merge farm and household buildings in one continuous structure that not only kept everything centralized but, also made it unnecessary to go outside in inclement weather. Built onto the rear of Variety Unit, the Toy Shop extends this tradition.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. Collection The impulse to play is universal, and throughout human history people not immediately preoccupied with survival have created playthings. Toys of earlier eras offer important clues to the lives of their makers and owners. Shelburne Museum’s collection of toys, which includes both European and American examples from the early nineteenth century through the first decades of the twentieth century, encompasses a broad range of both handmade and manufactured examples. Simple toys, both homemade and commercially produced, such as clay or glass marbles and cloth, wood, leather, or rubber balls, were widely available for purchase and would often reappear in new materials as manufacturing technology improved. Educational games, that began to appear in the late eighteenth century, document the skills and subjects that children were expected to master. The abundance of commercially produced American and European toys that appeared throughout the nineteenth century attests to technological advances and to changing perceptions of childhood and leisure. Colonial American toys included those of European manufacture as well as homemade examples. Cottage industries on both continents produced wooden blocks, hobby and rocking horses, puppets, dolls, and other simple toys of paper, cloth, wood, and metal. After the Civil War, Americans developed increasingly efficient ways to manufacture playthings and quickly emerged as leaders in the manufacture of cast-iron banks; miniature boats and wagons of tin, cast iron, or wood; and lithographed optical toys and board games. Although the United States dominated commercial toy manufacturing by 1900, individuals continued to make playthings by hand for a variety of reasons. Some toys, like whistles made from spring willow twigs or dandelion stems, simply could not be commercially produced. While those who could not afford store-bought toys often created homemade toys, even the affluent sometimes chose to carve a miniature cradle or a hobby horse, or to stitch a doll dress or a puppet as a special gift. Children also enjoy making toys and the nineteenth century saw an emergence of pattern books and instructional magazines for their use. References * Hill, Ralph Nading and Lilian Baker Carlisle.

Formerly, Sialkot has been the winter-capital of the State of Kashmir. The city is about north-west of Lahore and only a few kilometres from Jammu in India. The recorded history of Sialkot, a district of modern-day Pakistan, covers thousands of years. It has since its creation changed hands from Aryan, Persian, Hindu, Greek, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh and British rule to the present-day federation of Pakistan. Sources There are various sources tracing the origins of the city of Sialkot (ancient name:Sagala also spelt Sakala) but the authenticity of many of these sources varies. The less-reliable historical sources about the origins of the city have been derived from oral traditions. More reliable and validated historical references relating to the city date back to 327 BC in which it has been stated that the city is of Greek origin. Excavations throughout the area have revealed large amounts of Greek coins, ancient Zoroastrian temples and several Buddhist stupas. The antiquities of Sialkot have also been discussed by Sir Alexander Cunningham in his Archaeological Survey Reports, II, 21, 22, and XIV, 44 to 47. Mughal Era Sialkot became a part of the Sultanate of Delhi when Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Ghauri conquered Punjab in 1185. He was unable to conquer Lahore but left a garrison in Sialkot. Later, Sultan Khusro Malik tried to capture the city but failed to do so. Sialkot then became a part of the Mughal Empire. The Mughal commander, Usman Ghani Raza, advanced towards Delhi by way of Sialkot which capitulated to his armies. In 'Babur Nama', Zaheer-ud-Din Muhammad Babur records: The last great Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, appointed Ganga Dhar as faujdar of the city until 1654. Rahmat Khan was then placed in charge of the city, and would build a mosque in the city. Under Aurangzeb's reign, Sialkot became known as a great centre of Islamic thought and scholarship, Modern era During the Second Kashmir War in 1965, the Lahore-Sialkot region was attacked by the Indian Army which, despite overwhelming numerical superiority managed only to capture some outlying areas in the sector. The people of Sialkot came out in full force to support the troops of the Pakistan Army to repel the invasion by India.K Conboy, \\"Elite Forces of India and Pakistan\\" , page 9 In fact, the armoured battles in the Sialkot sector (especially, the Battle of Chawinda), in 1965, were the most intense since the Second World War.The India-Pakistan Air War of 1965, Synopsis.

Identified as a keystone species, P. ochraceus is considered an important indicator for the health of the intertidal zone. Description Cluster of stars, Salt Spring Island, British Columbia Two sea stars at Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area, Oregon. This sea star has five stout rays that range in length from 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 in). The rays are arranged around an ill-defined central disk. While most individuals are purple, they can be orange, orange-ochre, yellow, reddish, or brown. The aboral surface contains many small spines (ossicles) that are arranged in a netlike or pentagonal pattern on the central disk. The ossicles are no higher than 2 mm.Kozloff, E. N. (1996). Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle: University of Washington Press.McFadden, M. (2002). Pisaster ochraceus. Retrieved May 10, 2010, from https://web.archive.org/web/20090412083835/http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Echinodermata/Class%20Asteroidea/Pisaster_ochraceus.html In Pisaster the tube feet have suckers on their distal ends which allow them to attach to the rocky substrate and live in heavily wave-swept areas. P. ochraceus has a simple nervous system and does not have a brain. A nerve ring connects and relays impulses between the star's radial nerves. Two species that can be mistaken for P. ochraceus are P. giganteus, which has blue rings around white or purple spines, and P. brevispinus, which is pink with small white spines. These two species have different aboral spines and coloration which allows one to distinguish between the species. Evasterias troscheli may be confused with P. ochraceus at times as well. It can be distinguished by its smaller disk size and longer, tapering rays which are often thickest a short distance out from their base rather than at the base as in P. ochraceus.  Reproduction and life history =Reproduction= Members of Pisaster are dioecious but there is no sexual dimorphism and sexes can be separated only by the presence of eggs or sperm in the gonads. They reproduce by broadcast spawning, which occurs in the Puget Sound around May to July. There is no parental investment beyond spawning. Fertilization occurs in the water column and Pisaster ochraceous develops through several larval stages. The reproductive system consists of a pair of gonads branching into each ray off a circular genital strand which is along the oral inner surface of the central disc. The gonads look like a feathery collection of tubules. In females there are orange gonads and in males they are whitish.Nybakken, J. (1996). Diversity of the invertebrates. Hayward: California State University During maturation of the gametes, the gonads increase in size and can account for up to 40 percent of the sea star's weight. The gonopores are too small to be seen, and can only be found when the sea stars are spawning.Ramirez,Y. (2002). Pisaster ochraceus, Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved May 10, 2010, from http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pisaster_ochraceus.html. =Lifespan= Many sea stars live to a minimal age of four years. P. ochraceus can live as long as twenty years.\\"Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835)\\". Encyclopedia of Life. Retrieved May 10, 2010, from \\"http://www.eol.org/pages/598469\\". This species of seastar is often considered a keystone species in many intertidal regions. P. ochraceus is a predator of the California mussel, Mytilus californianus and reduces its abundance. This allows for other macroinvertebrates to persist. In an experimental removal of P. ochraceus, it was shown that Mytilus californianus becomes almost completely dominant of the intertidal community. When P. ochraceus is present there is a diverse intertidal community.Holsinger, K. (2005). Keystone species. Retrieved May 10, 2010, from Feeding At the larval stage, Pisaster ochraceus are filter feeders and their diet consists of plankton. As an adult, P. ochraceus feeds on mussels such as Mytilus californianus and Mytilus trossulus. They also feed on chitons, limpets, snails, barnacles, echinoids, and even decapod crustacea. P. ochraceus uses its tube feet to handle its prey. If the prey is too large to be swallowed whole, then it can use its tube feet to open shells. It can evert its stomach through its mouth and engulf its prey, liquify it with digestive enzymes and ingest the processed food. Mussels hold their valves together very securely but P. ochraceus can insert part of its everted stomach, or some digestive juices, through the narrow gap that exists where the byssal threads emerge from the shell. The mussel needs to open its valves periodically to feed and breathe and the sea star can exert a powerful traction with its tube feet, pulling the two valves further open. Once the stomach is inside the mussel, digestion takes place. It is thought one sea star can consume eighty Californian mussels in a year. Ecology and distribution P. ochraceus Oregon coast, near Cannon Beach. = Conservation = Pisaster ochraceus has been described as a keystone species. Experiments by zoologist Robert T. Paine in the 1960s demonstrated that a loss of only a few individual P. ochraceus seastars had a profound impact on mussel bed population, thereby reducing the health of the intertidal environment. With only a few natural predators (sea otters and seagulls) it is suggested that the principal enemies of P. ochraceus are human collectors and casual tidepool visitors. Pisaster ochraceus has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). =Geographic range= P. ochraceus can be found from Prince William Sound in Alaska to Point Sal in Santa Barbara Co., California. P. ochraceus found within the warmer waters from Santa Barbara County to Baja California is the subspecies P. o. segnis.Humphreys, V. (2003). The Biogeography of the Purple Ochre Sea Star (Pisaster ochraceus). Retrieved May 10, 2010, from =Habitat= This sea star can be found in great numbers on mussel beds and on wave-washed rocky shores. The juveniles are often found in crevices and under rocks. Its depth range is from above the low-tide zone to 90 m in depth. P. ochraceous is very durable and can tolerate a loss of thirty-percent of its body weight in body fluids. =Effects of ocean acidification= A study found that P. ochraceus will not be affected by ocean acidification in the same way as most calcareous marine animals. This normally causes decreased growth due to the increased acidity dissolving calcium carbonate. Researchers found that when P. ochraceus was exposed to and 770 ppm (beyond rises expected in the next century) that they survived. It is thought that this is because the animal's calcium is nodular and so it is able to compensate for the lack of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue instead.

A rockfall in 2008 damaged a number of structures, and about one third of visitor units were closed because of risk. In 2012, eight visitors to the park developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and three died. In 2016, the name was temporarily changed to Half Dome Village due to a trademark dispute between the National Park Service and a private concessions company, Delaware North. The name was restored in 2019 along with others in Yosemite, upon settlement of the dispute. Geography The resort is southeast of Yosemite Village, at an elevation of , and occupies a central position in the Yosemite Valley. It lies on a talus cone of debris from old rockfalls.  History  A 1921 advertisement for Camp Curry. In 1899 David A. Curry and Jenny Etta Foster (later known as Mother Curry) opened a tented camp. They advertised \\"a good bed and clean napkin with every meal\\" for $2 a day (equivalent to $ in dollars.) It was developed in the early 20th century as a camp concession for tourists to the park. It contains numerous rustic wooden cabins and tent cabins, and related amenities. In 1970 the community changed its post office name to Curry Village. Camp Curry offers lodging near Glacier Point. The complex, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), includes visitor cabins, a store, dining facilities, a lodge and a post office. The camp's structures are rustic wood-framed cabins with hipped roofs, set on stone foundations. The camp includes a large number of tent cabins, framed bases with tented roofs, a lower-cost lodging alternative developed in the early 20th century. Significant structures include the 1914 entrance sign, the 1904 Old Registration Office; the 1913 dance hall, now adapted as guest lodgings known as the Stoneman House; the 1916 Foster Curry cabin, and the 1917 Mother Curry's bungalow. Bungalows with en-suite baths were built from 1918 to 1922, and bungalows without plumbing were built during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1917, David Curry unexpectedly died from blood poisoning caused by a foot injury, leaving management of Camp Curry to his wife and a son. The Camp Curry post office opened in 1909. It changed its name to Curry Village in 1970. The village was listed on the NRHP on November 1, 1979. 21st-century events =2008 rockfall= A Curry Village wooden cabinCabin damage from the 2008 rockfallA rockfall occurred in Yosemite National Park on the morning of October 8, 2008, near Curry Village. Park officials estimated the rockfall volume at approximately , from a release halfway up the granite face above the village. Three visitors received minor injuries, and were treated and released. The rockfall destroyed two hard-sided visitor cabins and three tent cabins; three others were partially damaged. The Park Service evacuated visitors to Curry Village. Following a study by geologists, in November 2008, the park permanently closed 233 visitor accommodations and 43 concessioner-housing units at the site, about one third of the total units available in Curry Village. 36 units were reopened. Following a three-year study at Curry Village, the National Park Service announced in August 2011 that it would remove 72 buildings located within the rockfall hazard zone. The mostly hard-sided structures, including the Foster Curry Cabin, were to be documented and historic materials were salvaged. Replacement tent cabins were added to the site out of the hazard zone. =2012 Hantavirus outbreak= Tent cabins in Curry VillageIn August 2012, the National Park Service announced three confirmed cases and one probable case of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in visitors who had stayed in June in the new Signature Tent Cabins in Curry Village. At the time, two people had died. An estimated 10,000 people were possibly at risk because of exposure at the camp grounds. Having traced the cases to visitor stays earlier in the summer in what were called Signature Tent Cabins, erected to replace structures lost to the rockfall, the National Park Service closed all 91 new cabins. These are double-walled, with insulation between the walls. The park continued to allow visitors at its 300 single-wall tent cabins. The outbreak was thought due to visitor inhalation of aerolized droppings of deer mice, which nested in the tent insulation between the walls. About 14 percent of Yosemite deer mice carry hantavirus. State health experts had told Yosemite in 2010 about the risk to visitors of hantavirus infection. Park officials declined to warn visitors at the time because, according to park ranger Jana McCabe, in 2010 there was one reported case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome out of 4 million visitors. By early September 2013, a total of eight cases had been identified; seven visitors had stayed in the new tent cabins, and three had died. The eighth had been camping in Yosemite's high country. Yosemite sent emails to notify 230,000 people who had made reservations at the park. Three park employees with flu-like symptoms tested positive for a different strain of hantavirus, which does not cause the pulmonary syndrome. The outbreak was thought due to an unusual increase in the deer mouse population, and the design of the new tent cabins.

Background Isaak Jefimowitsch Tschemerinski was born into a Jewish merchant family, in Jelisavetgrad (now Kirovograd) in the Ukraine. In 1899, he relocated with his mother and sister to Berlin, where he attended school (Gymnasium) and thereupon completed studies in piano at a conservatory. In 1912 in Berlin, Tschemerinski began studies in science under, among others, Albert Einstein and Max Planck. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was first interned as a Russian citizen but voluntarily enlisted in the German army as interpreter, in which capacity he served in prisoner of war camps. Career =Communist Party of Germany= Tschemerinski’s wartime experiences radicalized his political sympathies towards the Spartakusbund. Upon resuming his studies, he befriended Paul Levi and Ruth Fischer, who convinced him to join the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He changed his name to Arkadi Maslow, and in November 1920 was elected to the KPD Central Committee. From 1921 Maslow, together with Ruth Fischer, led the left wing of the Berlin KPD. In 1921, Maslow became the foreign affairs editor of the Rote Fahne. Taken into custody by the Berlin police in 1922, he identified himself as a Soviet agent and a confidant of Leon Trotsky and Karl Radek. Because his passport had expired, he was sentenced to eight months in prison. To avoid serving prison term, he went into hiding. At the same time, a rumor circulated in the KPD that Maslow was a spy for the police. During a visit to Moscow in 1923, he was interrogated about these charges by an investigative committee of the Comintern, who exonerated and released him. However he remained under detention in Moscow until early 1924. In April 1924, Maslow and Fischer, criticized as “right-wing” by August Thalheimer and Heinrich Brandler, assumed leadership of the Party and were responsible for intensifying the “left-turn” of the KPD. Taken once again into custody in May 1925, Maslow, together with Paul Schlecht and Anton Grylewicz, was brought to court and sentenced to four years in prison. Because of his failing health, Maslow was released in July 1926. Since Maslow and Fischer no longer enjoyed the protection of Grigory Zinoviev, under a directive of Joseph Stalin to favor Ernst Thaelmann, they were relieved of the Party leadership, and on August 20, 1926, were excluded from the KPD. =Leninbund= Together with Ruth Fischer and Hugo Urbahns, Maslow brought together former members of the left wing of the KPD, which led to formation of the Leninbund in early 1928. The KPD thereupon accused Maslow of being an “Agent for the Bourgeoisie” and demanded that he not be allowed to leave Germany, under the supposition that his political work would then undermine the work of the KPD. In May 1928, Maslow and Fischer resigned from the Leninbund, because they disagreed with the Leninbund’s support of an independent candidate opposed to the KPD, and after the capitulation of Zinoviev and Kamenev who were opposed to Stalin, anticipated the hope (in vain) of being accepted again into the KPD. Until 1933, Maslow remained active as a translator and withdrew from extensive participation in political activity. =Exile= Following the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, Maslow and Fischer first fled to Paris, where they resided until 1940. From 1934 to 1936, Maslow worked closely with Trotsky and served as a part of the movement towards a Fourth International. After the break with Trotsky, Maslow and Ruth Fischer founded a circle with the name Marxist–Leninist International Group, which lasted until 1939. During the Moscow Trials of 1936 to 1938, Maslow was again accused by the Stalinist press as an espionage agent. Death After the fall of France in 1940, Maslow and Fischer fled to Cuba. Unlike Fischer, he was unable to obtain an entry visa to the USA. On 20 November 1941, Maslow was found dead on a street in Havana. According to an official investigation, he had suffered a heart attack. However, Ruth Fischer and Franz Pfemfert were of the opinion that Maslow was murdered by the NKVD.Hermann Weber: Maslow, Arcadij. In: Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB), Volume 16, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 1990, p 356. In 1952, Guenther Reinhardt concurred and described his \\"accidental death\\" in details that implicated the NKVD. Reinhardt also claimed that Fischer later discovered that her own brother, Gerhard Eisler, had given the kill order. Works * Die zwei Revolutionen des Jahres 1917.

It is closely related to the Gibbaeum and Faucaria genera. The name comes from ancient Greek γλωττίς glottis \\"tongue\\" and φύλλον phyllon \\"leaf\\". The species are native to South Africa, specifically to Cape Province and the Karoo desert. They grow in rocks and soils incorporating slate, sandstone and quartz. Rainfall in their native areas is between , most of which falls in March and November. Description Glottiphyllum plants have thick, soft leaves arranged in pairs that are low to the ground and often graze the soil surface. They also have rhizomes. They sport yellow flowers with narrow petals in the autumn and winter. The flowers are sometimes fragrant and around 5 cm in diameter. The species readily interbreed, making hybridization easy.

Before that, he was the Sergeant-at-Arms and later the Vice President. He is nicknamed \\"Chibs\\" because of his facial scars (\\"chib\\" is Scots slang for \\"street blade\\" or a stabbing weapon). (Flanagan's scars are real, received in a bar scuffle where his attackers branded him with \\"the Glasgow smile\\".) On his colors, he wears the following patches: \\"Sgt. at Arms\\", \\"V. President\\" (replaced with \\"President\\"), \\"Sons of Anarchy\\", and the \\"In Memory of Opie\\" patch. Chibs is extremely loyal to Jax Teller and the club; he also has good relationships with Tig Trager, Half-Sack Epps (a prospect he sponsored), and Juice Ortiz, with whom he has a father-like relationship that ends after Juice's eventual betrayal of the club.  Biography  Chibs is SAMCRO's connection with the Real IRA, which sells guns to organized crime groups within the United States. He is originally from Glasgow, Scotland, but grew up in Belfast, Northern IrelandChibs Telford at FX.com and is heard speaking Scottish Gaelic. As he tells Real IRA member Cameron Hayes, whom he patches up after Cameron is shot, Chibs served as a medic with the British Army for five months before being court-martialed. Chibs was excommunicated from the Real IRA by the group's leader, Jimmy O'Phelan, who out of jealousy scarred Chibs' face, told him never to return to Ireland, stole Chibs' wife Fiona Larkin (who, as shown in Season 2 remains married to and still loves, but is estranged from Chibs), and raised Chibs and Fiona's daughter, Kerrianne. Chibs then joined SAMBEL in Ireland until he transferred to SAMCRO in the United States, whose Charming charter has Real IRA links via the club's Belfast charter. =Sons of Anarchy= Season 1 The Sons of Anarchy find their weapon storage warehouse being burned down. When they arrive at the scene, police are already investigating. Gun parts and the corpses of two illegal immigrants are found inside. Later that night, all of the chapter's members attend a meeting (\\"church\\" or \\"chapel\\") where they are informed it was the Mayans, a rival biker gang, who destroyed the warehouse, and who is now storing the guns in San Leandro. The Sons decide to ride out to San Leandro the next night and steal the weapons back. Clay Morrow, Jax Teller, Tig Trager, and Chibs all go to the industrial storage warehouse in San Leandro and locate the guns, but are interrupted by four men who turn up in a car outside. Clay and Tig take care of the men, three of whom are Mayans. The other man, Whistler, is a Nord; Whistler shoots Jax, twice, in his bulletproof vest, and Jax then shoots Whistler dead. SAMCRO then takes the weapons, bombs the warehouse, and flees.Pilot - Recap The police begin to investigate the club when they discover the burned-down warehouse belonged to the Sons of Anarchy, and the Sons decide to distract the police to keep them off their case. Chibs, Jax, Juice Ortiz, and Half-Sack Epps steal a car owned by Ernest Darby, the leader of the Nordics, a neo-Nazi gang, and two dead bodies from the local morgue. They then stage the Mexican and white corpses in a fake shoot-out made to look like a racist murder involving the Nordics. On the way back to town, the Sons are cut off by a man driving a red muscle car. They later catch up with this man at a convenience store/petrol station, and Jax beats him up. The man then pulls out a pistol and attempts to shoot Jax, but Jax wrestles him to the ground, and then the Pakistani shopkeeper kills the man with a fire axe. Chibs then steals the store's CCTV tapes, and the Sons flee the scene. Later on Chibs attends the \\"funeral\\" of the two Mexican prostitutes killed in the warehouse fire.Seeds - Recap The Sons and Gemma receive a cold reception from local businessman Elliot Oswald and his family at a nearby traveling carnival. Nonetheless, when Oswald soon goes to Clay and asks the Sons to find the man who raped his 13-year-old daughter, the Sons quickly agree. When the gang discovers the rapist is one of the carnies, they return to the carnival. After a brief fight with the carnies, the Sons retrieve the rapist, then torture and murder him. (Chibs proves to be one of the gang's most capable fighters during the brawl with the carnies.) Later on, when Michael McKeavey of the Real IRA comes to Charming to sell weapons, Chibs travels \\"up north\\" with him.Fun Town - Recap The club enters Half-Sack into a bare-knuckle boxing competition to raise funds to buy weapons. He is trained by Chibs, who enforces Clay's order that Half-Sack have \\"no booze, no weed, and no pussy\\". At the competition, Half-Sack wins every bout up to the final round, but then Chibs and Tig tell him to take a dive because they bet on the opponent. Half-Sack reluctantly agrees but then sees Cherry cheek-kiss and hug Clay at ring-side, which incites a sudden surge of rage, and Half-Sack knocks his opponent out.Old Bones - Recap Chibs and Jax have to go into a One-Niners bar in Oakland to retrieve Piney Winston, after Piney barges in, takes a hostage, and demands to know who killed his daughter-in-law, Donna. That night, Chibs goes with Tig and Happy to San Joaquin to kill the witness who has identified Bobby and Opie as Brenan Hefner murderers. The safe house is being guarded by two sheriffs and a female ATF agent, but Tig, Chibs, and Happy manage to knock all three unconscious and gain entry to the house. When they see the witness is a teenage girl, the Sons initially have doubts about killing her. However, Tig steps up, and just before he shoots her, Jax stops him at gunpoint from doing so. Jax then tells Chibs and Happy to leave and beats Tig up for killing Donna. Season One ends with Donna's funeral, which is attended by SAMCRO and other numerous other Sons from other SOA chapters.The Revelator - Recap Season 2 Chibs narrowly escapes death from a car bomb explosion set up by Zobell to end the life of a SAMCRO member, causing him to spend about half of the season at St. Thomas Hospital. Tara tells Jax Chibs' condition is critical, but stable; the explosion slammed Chibs' head into the ground and caused cranial bleeding. In the episode \\"Potlatch\\", Chibs' wife Fiona has returned to Charming and checks on Chibs. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and says the kiss is from Kerrianne, but she then calls him \\"My Love\\", in Irish Gaelic. Gemma tells Tara that Fiona is one of the only three women who scare her, that Chibs and Fiona have been separated a long time and just never got a divorce, and that they need to keep Chibs in this hospital so Fiona can never be alone with him. In the episode \\"Fa Guan\\", Jax visits Chibs and updates him on what's going on. Chibs says Jimmy O (whom Edmond Hayes mentioned in an earlier episode might be coming stateside) would never let Fiona travel alone, so Jimmy O has to be here as well. Tara informs Chibs he will be moved to a different hospital for the rest of his recovery. This news upsets him; he says he needs to be in a place where there is protection. Later on, Chibs follow Tara's advice to pretend to have a severe head pain and claims he cannot see through his right eye, in order to stay in critical care. In the episode \\"Balm\\", Chibs is released from the hospital. En route to the clubhouse, he tells Half-Sack they should stop by CaraCara. Half-Sack informs Chibs that CaraCara burned down, and Jax is going Nomad. In the same episode, it is also revealed that Jimmy O kicked Chibs out of Ireland and the IRA, took Chibs' wife for himself, raised Chibs' daughter, and is responsible for the scars on his face. Agent Stahl attempts to use this history to get Chibs to inform on the Real IRA. Chibs initially refuses this offer, but after Jimmy O insinuates that he will begin a sexual relationship with Chibs' daughter if Chibs does not cooperate with his attempts to repair the IRA's relationship with SAMCRO (Jimmy O wants a meeting with Clay), Chibs turns to Stahl and offers information in exchange for his wife and daughter's safety (Stahl says she will put them in witness protection), and the ATF's promise to keep SAMCRO out of their investigation into the Irish. In the episode \\"Service\\", Chibs meets with Stahl to sign the deal he proposed. When he realizes Stahl altered their agreement, he refuses to sign any documents. Stahl threatens to reveal Chibs' betrayal to the Real IRA, which would mean certain death for his wife and abducted daughter. Opie accidentally sees Chibs and Stahl exiting the same building. Feeling helpless and ashamed for both dealing behind SAMCRO's back and for his plan's backfiring, Chibs sits alone in the auto shop, where Gemma sees him. Gemma gives Chibs advice and encourages him to tell the truth to Clay and the others, which he does. Clay tells him he did not sign anything, so he is not a rat. Chibs is later picked as one of SAMCRO's 10 best fighters against L.O.A.N. When A.J. Weston is arrested and released, Chibs, Jax, and Opie corner him in a tattoo parlor bathroom, and Jax shoots him to death. Chibs later comforts Jax over Abel's kidnapping. Season 3 Chibs is one of the Sons who accompanies Jax to Belfast to look for Abel. There, Chibs is reunited with his estranged wife and his daughter. Although Kerrianne's display of affection is initially hesitant, she and Chibs eventually hug, and she calls him \\"Da\\". In \\"Firinne\\", Chibs is involved in the capture of McGee and the shootout between Jimmy's men and SAMCRO. Chibs also loses his nephew Padraic in a truck explosion set up by SAMBEL's then sergeant-at-arms Liam O'Niell, which deeply upsets Chibs. In the Season 3 finale, Chibs finally gets his revenge on Jimmy O by giving him the same Glasgow Smile Jimmy gave him and subsequently stabbing him to death. He then uses Jimmy's own blood to paint a Real IRA symbol on the rear windshield of Stahl's cruiser, to make it look like the Real IRA committed the hit. Season 4 Along with Opie, Piney, and Kozik, Chibs coordinates the day-to-day operations of the club while the others are in prison, and organizes the setup of increased IRA \\"hardware\\" traffic. Chibs is at Stockton welcoming Clay, Jax, Bobby, Juice, Happy, and Tig after they are released from prison, and later attends Opie's wedding. Chibs, Bobby, Happy, and Juice sneak away from the meeting to handle the Russian hardware, and eventually double-cross and murder the Russians, as well as an undercover FBI agent. Along with the rest of the club, Chibs is reluctant to enter into a deal with the drug cartel, but he points out that the high volume of guns being moved will keep the IRA happy. However, he votes against the deal when it comes to a final decision, stating he doesn't trust the cartel. In the season finale, following Clay's unraveling secrets and Jax's taking the gavel, Jax appoints Chibs Sergeant-at-Arms, and Chibs thereby takes Tig's seat at the table. Season 5 Chibs is shown to be sticking closer to Jax than ever in his new position as Sergeant-at-Arms. When the Sons are attacked by Niners during a muling run, Tig tries to kill Laroy Wayne and accidentally kills Wayne's girlfriend Veronica Pope. Chibs attends a meeting of the Sons, the Niners, and powerful gangster Damon Pope (Veronica's father) to cease hostilities. Chibs and Jax are charged with the highway shooting of one of the Niners, and Tig with running down Veronica, when they are identified by witnesses bought by Pope, who wants them inside so the black prison gangs he controls can kill them. The three Sons are arrested, along with Opie (who assaults Roosevelt in order to be sent to prison with them), and are sent to Stockton. They are initially protected by Mexicans, thanks to the cartel, but Pope demands a dead Son for the Niner and cop they killed, as well as for Tig to stay inside for life. Opie takes the fall, and Chibs screams in horror as he watches Opie beaten to death. When they get out, Jax makes a new deal with Pope to cut his gang in on the muling business for a bigger payment. Pope also gives Jax the identity and address of the prison sergeant who had Opie killed. The Sons track the guard down, and Jax beats him past death with a snow globe, until Chibs pulls Jax off. When it's revealed the three Nomads Gogo, Greg, and Frankie are behind the Charming break-ins, the Sons try to track them down. Unser and Clay kill Gogo and Greg, when they try to assassinate Unser. The Sons later find Frankie, who robs Nero of watches and $130,000 in cash, and kidnaps and injures Chibs. Later, Jax and Bobby tell Chibs about the RICO case facing SOA and the rat who helped the Feds set it up: Juice. Chibs is enraged at the betrayal and embarrassed at the leverage; Juice's dad is black. When the Sons find the man who beat Opie to death, he is revealed to be the cousin of the Grim Bastard's President T.O. Jax promises not to kill him, but after questioning him about the others, Chibs shoots him in the head with a silenced pistol. He states they did what they had to do. Since Bobby disagrees, and it could come to a head, Jax asks Chibs if he is in his corner. Chibs replies, \\"I've always been there, and I always will. I love you, kid. You understand?\\", and then goes to clean up from the shooting. Season 6 Following Bobby's resignation, Chibs takes over as Vice President of SAMCRO. Although originally less vocally opposed to Jax's decisions as President as his predecessor, Chibs nevertheless grows frustrated when Jax angrily tells the Irish that he is getting SAMCRO out of guns without consulting him first, leading to a straining of the Club's relationship with the IRA. Following an altercation between Jax and Galen O'Shay, the Irish kill full-patch member Phil and prospect V-Lin, igniting a war between the Sons and the Irish. When Jax offers the gun trade to August Marks without consulting either Chibs or the Club as a whole, Chibs grows furious that Jax once again made a critical decision without bringing it to the table for a vote. Despite his grievances with Jax's conduct, Chibs nevertheless stays loyal to his President and aids him in their plans to move SAMCRO out of guns. When the Club goes into lockdown to avoid further casualties at the hands of the Irish, Jax and Chibs are the first to discover that the IRA have planted bombs beneath the Clubhouse that are set to explode at the time when all the Club members would be at the table. Jax and Chibs order an evacuation of the Clubhouse, with Jax running back inside when he discovers that Abel is still sleeping in the guest room. Chibs follows him in, making sure Jax and Abel escape before he, too, leaves just as the Clubhouse explodes behind them. Following the explosion, Chibs reassured Jax that \\"we are going to fix this\\". When the Club decides to vote on Clay \\"meeting Mr Mayhem\\", Chibs supports Jax's decision. Clay assists Jax in killing Galen when he and Tig kill Galen's guards to make the scene look like a deal gone wrong. Checking that Jax is good with killing Clay himself, he stands back and watches silently as Jax shoots Clay through the neck, killing him instantly. When Jax decides that the only way to save Tara, himself and the Club is to hand himself in as the supplier of the guns used in the school shooting at the beginning of the season, Chibs and Bobby argue against his decision. Jax insists that there is no other way and suggests that Chibs retain his position as VP when Bobby steps in as acting President. Chibs reluctantly agrees and tearfully bids goodbye to Jax as his President heads home to hand himself in to Eli Roosevelt, not knowing that Tara and Eli have just been murdered by Gemma.  Season 7  When Jax is released from a brief stay in prison following Tara's murder, for possession of firearms, Chibs is one of the first to comfort Jax upon his return. Bobby steps down as acting President, but Chibs retains his position as Vice President to Jax. When Gemma falsely identifies one of Henry Lin's soldiers as Tara's murder, Chibs assists Jax in capturing him but watches in silent disgust as Jax tortures the (unbeknown to them) innocent man to death. Contacting President Jury White for help in an attack against the Lin Triad, Chibs accompanies Bobby and Jax to the home of two men who helped Jury in the attack. The trio kill the men, making it look like a murder-suicide, not knowing that one of the men they killed is in fact Jury's son. When Juice returns to Charming, having been on the run for betraying the Club, Unser sets up a meeting between him and Chibs. Chibs angrily tells Juice that he should have killed himself when he had the chance, but decides not to tell Jax about Juice's return. Meanwhile, Chibs strikes up a romantic relationship with Althea Jarry of the San Joaquin Police Department, much to the amusement of the Club. When Bobby is captured and tortured by August Marks, Chibs is visibly distraught when Marks sends Jax a Tupperware box containing Bobby's eye and later his severed fingers. Meanwhile, Jax begins to suspect that Jury is the one who ratted to the Chinese. When Jax fights and kills Jury, Jury's VP Gaines tells Jax that he is unfit to be President and tries to attack him, only to be restrained by Chibs who angrily states that \\"my boy ain't going nowhere\\". He later warns Jax that killing Jury will bring a lot of heat down on him and the Club, and that he should be prepared to defend himself. After Bobby's murder at Marks' hands, Chibs is present when SAMCRO, the One-Niners and the Aryan Brotherhood ambush Bobby's torturer Moses and a gang of Mark's men. Having gunned down Mark's men, and with Moses at their mercy, Chibs uses a knife to cut off Moses' fingers after watching with satisfaction as Jax takes out his eye. Jax then shoots Moses through the back of the head. Later, when Jax travels north to confront Gemma over Tara's murder, he leaves Chibs to handle the situation with the Chinese. He and several other SAMCRO members burst into a Chinese gambling hall and massacre Lin's remaining men - with Lin dead in Stockton at Juice's hands, and his remaining soldiers killed, this ultimately brings an end to SAMCRO's war against the Chinese. Jax agrees to step down as President over his killing of Jury, who was in fact innocent in ratting out the Club to the Chinese, but asks that the Club remove its written bylaw against having black members. Chibs nominates T.O. Cross, and it passes unanimously. Afterwards, Jax talks privately with Chibs, telling him that he came clean about Jury's murder to the other Presidents and recommended the Mayhem vote. Though distraught, Chibs promises Jax that he'll do as he's asked. Afterwards, Chibs meets with Jarry, who breaks off their relationship. Chibs tells her it's a mistake, because cops who land on the wrong side of the Club \\"tend to go away.\\". Back at the new Clubhouse in Red Woody, Chibs tells the Sons they can't let their hearts be louder than their reason. He chokes back tears as he calls for Jax's mayhem vote. They solemnly vote unanimously in favor. When Jax arrives at a warehouse and meets Chibs and the other surviving SAMCRO members, he presents Chibs with his President patch and lets Chibs choose his VP: Chibs chooses Tig, which Jax remarks is a \\"good choice\\". As Jax prepares for Chibs to shoot him, Chibs instead shoots Happy in the arm and tells Jax that they'll lie to the other Presidents, telling them that Jax laid down some fire and got away. As Jax bids goodbye to each of his SAMCRO brothers in turn, he leaves Chibs for last and the two share a long embrace. He watches as Jax rides away on J.T.'s bike towards his death, telling them all \\"I've got this.\\". Chibs is last seen sitting at the head of the table, holding the President's patch in his hand. =Mayans M.C.= Season 2 Following the event of Sons of Anarchy, Chibs who now has taken over for Jax as the ruler of the MC, makes a reappearance. Jax Teller's (Charlie Hunnam) final wish was for his club to leave the gun trade, to which Chibs agrees to oblige. The episode shows as Chibs and the Sons help coordinate the takeover of the guns supply business. Chibs reveals the port where they get their supply is shutting down after one more drop and then they will be done, and there's nothing they can do about it. The hurdle, however, presents the perfect opportunity for another club to take over and finally get SAMCRO out of the business. Things take a turn when the Sons reveal a negotiation with another club from Tijuana who could take over. The group is the same one the Mayans fought with in last week's episode, meaning they might not want to negotiate with them. The Sons say they did not hear of the drama, meaning things could still be salvageable. Chibs and the Sons later act as moderators during the negotiations between he Mayans and the Mexican club, the Vatos. Despite some tension during the negotiation, it appeared as if both clubs had come to a reasonable agreement to continue the gun trade with new arrangements.

The team drove 26,000 km down the Pan-American Highway starting from north Alaska in July 2010, this was filmed by the documentary maker Claudio Von Planta.Interview with Claudio von Planta by Transport evolved Motivation Sustainability - Electric vehicles have the potential to realise a sustainable transport future, without depleting valuable resources for future generations. The RGE project aims to demonstrate this while pushing the boundaries of electric vehicle (EV) technology. Education - The team want to help encourage the next generation of scientists and engineers through the outreach program. They plan to use the RGE project as an exhilarating example of where maths and science can take you. Adventure - The Radical SRZero aims to be the world’s most focused, fun-to- drive alternative propulsion vehicle. By taking on this epic journey, they hope to add a sense of excitement and get people interested in electric vehicles. RGE’s vehicle thumb RGE was sponsored an SR8 rolling chassis by Radical Sportscars to convert into a road legal electric sportscar. The electric SR8, dubbed the SRZero, was designed and built in just 7 months with components donated by many other companies. On May 21, 2010, the car drove for the first time, but subsequent problems with electromagnetic interference (EMI) put the car back in the garage for several days work to rectify the problem. However, by the end of April the car had been successfully track tested up to a limited speed of 100 mph (160 km/h). On April 29, 2010 the car passed the Individual Vehicle Assessment (IVA), and so is road legal in the UK and abroad. The SRZero now has the largest battery pack by energy storage out of any known road legalised vehicle in the UK. The trip In July 2010 the team took the 400 bhp SRZero all 26,000 km of the Pan-American Highway, educating and raising awareness along the way. Part of the mission is to dispel any worries about the range of electric cars. On the days of full driving the batteries will be drained 2/3, charged 1/3 and then depleted ready for an overnight charge. The journey lasted roughly three months, stopping at all major cities along the route to showcase the car and technology. Public engagement The public were encouraged to get involved wherever possible. Suggestions regarding places to visit on the trip, places to showcase the car, useful contacts, or even personal favours were all greatly appreciated via Twitter or email. Origins Racing Green Endurance was born as a spin-off from Imperial Racing Green in late 2008. Imperial Racing Green is an undergraduate teaching project to design and build fuel cell/electric hybrid racing cars, involving around 100 students from 8 departments within the university. The students are now designing and building the third generation of fuel cell powered racers.Imperial Magazine monthly Podcast on Racing Green and Racing Green EnduranceTranscript of Imperial Magazine monthly Podcast on Racing Green and Racing Green Endurance External links *Racing Green Endurance Website *RGE Facebook Page *Imperial College Press Article *Imperial Racing Green Website References Category:Clubs and societies of Imperial College London Category:Electric vehicles Category:Zero-emissions vehicles Category:Green racing ","title":"Racing Green Endurance"},{"id":"23158291","text":"Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan (; b. 21 May 1930), , is a retired four-star rank admiral and a former diplomat who served as a Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) of Pakistan Navy from being appointed in 1983 until retiring from his service in 1986.http://chr.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/21/1/95https://www.flickr.com/photos/pimu/864111636/http://www.mabaig.co.uk/paf/Squadrons/8.html Prior to that, he was appointed as the High Commissioner of Pakistan to Australia and served from 1986 until 1992, when he retired from the foreign service.

In the mid 1800s, the railway to Vladivostok was being constructed through the Siberian village where the Bogdanov family lived. The chief foreman of the railroad construction told Bogdanova how much he admired his talent. The foreman suggested Bogdanova go to Saint Petersburg. Shortly after, Bogdanova moved with his family to the city. Bogdanova's inventions were soon compared with those of Ivan Kulibin (born Niznhy Novgorod 1735 1818). Bogdanov was welcomed into the city's mechanical workshops, and learned to operate trains. Капков Сергей: \\"Короли комедии - Гликерия Богданова- Чеснокова\\". On 13 May 1904, Bogdanova-Chesnokova was born in Saint Peterburg. After the October Revolution, calendar dates were shifted forward by thirteen days, making her legal date of birth the twenty-sixth. Her childhood nickname was \\"Lika\\". The Bogdanov family lived in a cottage in Vyborg. Bogdanova- Chesnokova had a brother and a sister. Her mother owned a sewing workshop, and was said to be \\"a well-read, sophisticated, young woman of refined taste, having a great sense of fashion\\". Bogdanova-Chesnokova was a student with a good memory (per the Russian saying, \\"a memory from God\\"). She was a good linguist (learning Chinese) and a mimic. Her mother took her to the theatre and Bogdanova-Chesnokova participated in the school theatre group. In early World War I, aged twelve, Bogdanova-Chesnokova entertained wounded soldiers.

On 25 October (7 November) 1917, she was present at the assault of the Winter Palace during the October Revolution as a member of the Vyborg Side. Later, Bogdanova-Chesnokova described how wondrous she had found it to have unfettered access to the Winter Palace, the Hermitage, the Tsar's rooms and so on when she had worked in the part of the palace being used as a military hospital. From 1917 to August 1919, a time of food shortages and hard times, Bogdanova-Chesnokova worked under Alexander Vermishev. Vermishev was a keen theatre-goer and organized, along with Aleksei Badayev, an independent theatre activity group. Vermishev was later killed in war.

Koinon means \\"Common\\", it could be attributed with commonwealth, commune or collective but these terms have associated connotations because of already established usage. The Koinon was a form of government that had existed in various periods in Greek history. In Epirus itself there had in ancient times existed the Koinon of the Molossians. There was a Koinon of Laconians, centred on Sparta and its old dominions for a period under Roman rule, a Koinon of the Macedonians, also under Roman rule. In modern Greek history, during the Greek War of Independence, a local self- government termed Koinon was set up in the islands of Hydra, Spetsai and Psara.  History In the 1420s, Epirus was a Byzantine dominion. In 1430-1431, Sinan Pasha, a general of Sultan Murad II, led an army into Epirus and fought a series of battles that led to its eventual conquest. Fourteen villages of central Zagori reached a very favourable agreement with Sinan Pasha, following one such battle (near Votsa),Βασίλης Μπινακάκης Ζαγοροχώρια’’ Explorer 2006, Athens that the Turks would guarantee certain privileges for the region of Zagori in return for vassalage. These privileges included an autonomous government headed by a Head Prelate called Vekylis () (elected every 6 months or every year) and a Council of Elders (). The Elders were representing each village and were elected locally. The Zagorisians would not pay taxes to the Ottomans but an obligation was agreed upon to maintain a number of attendants to the Sultan's stables. The Zagorisians maintained a small armed force of Sipahi cavalry (Σπαχῆδες). Fifty years later, the villages of Eastern Zagori also joined the Treaty. This agreement, called \\"Voiniko\\" was modified in 1670. The Koinon of the Zagorisians was set up and further privileges called \\"Siouroutia\\" were established, thanks to the influence of Phanariots of Zagorisian descent. These included the replacement of the obligation to send attendants to the Sultan's stables with a tax, the free exercise of the Christian faith and significantly a prohibition of entry of Turks into Zagori. The villages of Western Zagori entered the Koinon of the Zagorisians in 1750. From 1750, the Vekylis of Zagori took up residence in Ioannina, in a House of the Koinon of the Zagorisians or in private. He was responsible for the collection of taxes and for judging civil law disputes. During the Ottoman period Zagori was one of three Greek regions that enjoyed autonomy under a treaty, the other two were Mani in the Peloponnese and Mademochoria in Macedonia.

They have full access to the District's extracurricular programs.Brookville Area School District Administration, Brookville Blended School information pamphlet, 2012 Special education In December 2010, the District administration reported that 317 pupils or 18.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 58.9% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the Brookville Area School District administration reported that 321 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 58% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the Brookville Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Brookline Area School District received a $1,109,613 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2010–11 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 99 or 5.51% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Enrollment Brookville Area School District enrollment was 1,885 students in 2004, and it spent $8,463 per pupil.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, report on Cost Effectiveness of Public school District Consolidation Part 2, June 2007 In 2009, The District's enrollment K-12 was only 1,600. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects steadily declining enrollment for the next decade. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects that enrollment will continue to decline, due to a lower local birthrate, to 1400 pupils in 2020. In 2008, Brookville Area School District's administrative costs were $737.18 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob. Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of Brookville Area School Administration with 4 neighboring districts: Clarion-Limestone Area School District, Forest Area School District, North Clarion County School District and Ridgway Area School District. The study found that consolidation of the Brookville Area Administration, with an adjacent school district, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. For example: a consolidation with Ridgway Area School District would save $2,108,131 or a consolidation with Forest Area School District would save $3,323,963. According to a report in 2012 by the Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office, public school enrollment will continue to decline through 2020. Statewide middle and high school aged residents (10 to 19) will decline by 76,900 (4.5 percent).Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office, Economic & Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013-2018, November 2012 Rural Pennsylvania PreK-12 school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools continue to rise. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation (500 in 2012). In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009–10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.

In 2010, Brookville Area Administration reported an increase to $2,119,369.00 in the reserved-undesignated fund balance and zero in its unreserved-undesignated fund. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In November 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration. Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. Or a student living in a neighboring public school district may seek admission to Brookville Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,904.29, High School - $8,659.49 The District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax - 1%, an occupational assessment, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government.

Race to the Top Brookville Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district millions in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, January 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Technology grant Brookville Area School District qualified for a $50,000 Enhancing Education Through Technology grant provided by the federal government. Literacy grant Brookville Area School District was awarded a $724,085 competitive literacy grant, in May 2012. The funding is to be used to improve reading skills birth through 12th grade.

The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the Brookville Area School Board at 27.3339 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. *2011-12 - 25.4300 mills. *2010-11 - 24.9600 mills *2009-10 - mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 24.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 24.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 24.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 24.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 The average yearly property tax paid by Jefferson County residents amounts to about 2.52% of their yearly income. Jefferson County is ranked 949th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Brookville Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.

The superior temporal sulcus is the first sulcus inferior to the lateral fissure. Studies reveal multisensory processing capabilities. Research has documented activation in the STS as a result of five specific social inputs, and thus the STS is assumed to be implicated in social perception. It showed increased activation related to: voices versus environmental sounds, stories versus nonsense speech, moving faces versus moving objects, biological motion, and theory of mind (false belief stories versus false physical stories). It is involved in the perception of where others are gazing (joint attention) and is thus important in determining where others' emotions are being directed. The superior temporal sulcus has an asymmetric structure between the left and right hemisphere, with the superior temporal sulcus being longer in the left hemisphere, but deeper in the right hemisphere. This asymmetrical structural organization between hemispheres has only been found to occur in the superior temporal sulcus of the human brain. Ordered from posterior to anterior activation of the superior temporal sulcus, theory of mind, biological motion, faces, voices, and language were each shown to produce strong responses when subjects perceive these stimuli. In individuals without autism, the superior temporal sulcus also activates when hearing human voices. It is thought to be a source of sensory encoding linked to motor output through the superior parietal-temporal areas of the brain inferred from the time course of activation. The conclusion of pertinence to vocal processing can be drawn from data showing that the regions of the STS (superior temporal sulcus) are more active when people are listening to vocal sounds rather than non-vocal environmentally based sounds and corresponding control sounds, which can be scrambled or modulated voices. These experimental results indicate the involvement of the STS in the areas of speech and language recognition. The majority of studies find it is the middle to the posterior portion of the STS that is involved in phonological processing, with bilateral activation indicated though including a mild left hemisphere bias due to greater observed activation. However, the role of the anterior STS in the ventral pathway of speech comprehension and production has not been ruled out. Evidence for the involvement of the middle portion of the STS in phonological processing comes from repetition-suppression studies, which use fMRI to pinpoint areas of the brain responsible for specialized stimulus involvement by habituating the brain to the stimulus and recording differences in stimulation response. The resulting pattern showed expected results in the middle portion of the STS.  Speech perception  Studies using fMRI analysis to measure superior temporal sulcus activation have found that phonemes, words, sentences, and phonological cues all lead to increased activation throughout a posterior-anterior axis in the temporal lobe. This pattern of activation, which most frequently occurs in the left hemisphere, has been termed the ventral stream of speech perception. Many studies consistently indicate that the superior temporal sulcus activation is associated with the interpretation of phonological signals. Although present research suggest that the left hemisphere of the superior temporal sulcus and its associated left ventral stream plays a role in phonological processing, the right hemisphere of the superior temporal sulcus has been connected to the perception of voice and the prosody of speech. According to the audiological pathway model supplied by Hickok and Poeppel, after the spectrotemporal analysis conducted by the auditory cortex, the STS is responsible for interpretation of vocal input through the phonological network. This implication is shown in the activation of the region in tasks of speech perception and processing, which necessarily involves access to and continuance of phonological information. By manipulating the interactions of phonological data, represented by the provision of words with high or low neighborhood density (words associated with many or few other words), the fluctuation of activity of the STS region can be seen. This changing activation links the STS with the phonological pathway.  Theory of mind  Neuroimaging studies examining the theory of mind, otherwise known as the ability to attribute mental states to others, have identified the posterior superior temporal sulcus of the right hemisphere as being involved in its processing. Activation of this region in the theory of mind has been found to be best predicted by independent ratings from other groups of participants, or more specifically, how much each item in the study made them consider the protagonist’s point of view.Dodell-Feder D, Koster-Hale J, Bedny M, Saxe R. fMRI item analysis in a theory of mind task. Neuroimage. 2011;55(2):705-712. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.040. Reports noted in other studies suggest a number of inconsistencies with the localization of theory of mind processing, such as the middle and anterior portions of the superior temporal sulcus having increased activation in response to theory of mind tasks. Thus, further research is needed to expand upon the precise functional role of the superior temporal sulcus in the perception of theory of mind.  Face perception  A recent study identified a region of the posterior superior temporal sulcus that is preferentially activated in the interpretation of facial expressions.Direito B, Lima J, Simões M, et al. Targeting dynamic facial processing mechanisms in superior temporal sulcus using a novel fMRI neurofeedback target. Neuroscience. 2019;496:97-108. doi:10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.02.024 Similarly, another study found that transcranial magnetic simulation disrupted the neural response to faces, but not the neural response to bodies or objects.Pitcher D, Japee S, Rauth L, Ungerleider LG. The Superior Temporal Sulcus Is Causally Connected to the Amygdala: A Combined TBS-fMRI Study. J Neurosci. 2017;37(5):1156–1161. doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0114-16.2016 The patterns of activations found in this study suggests that facial information is processed by projections in the right hemisphere from the posterior superior temporal sulcus, through the anterior superior temporal sulcus, and into the amygdala. Another study showed that the resting-state functional connectivity between the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, the right occipital face area, early visual cortex, and bilateral superior temporal sulcus was positively correlated with each subject’s ability to recognize facial expression.Wang X, Song Y, Zhen Z, Liu J. Functional integration of the posterior superior temporal sulcus correlates with facial expression recognition. Hum Brain Mapp. 2016;37(5):1930-1940. doi:10.1002/hbm.23145.  Face-voice audiovisual integration  Many studies have suggested that the posterior superior temporal sulcus is associated the crossmodal binding of auditory and visual stimuli. The activation of this posterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus was reported in the detection of audio-visual incongruences and in voice perception. The posterior superior temporal sulcus has also been shown to be preferentially activated by lip reading.Uno T, Kawai K, Sakai K, et al. Dissociated roles of the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus in audiovisual processing: top-down and bottom-up mismatch detection. PLoS One. 2015;10(3):e0122580. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0122580 An area of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus was characterized by a recent study by a stronger response to audiovisual stimuli compared to that of auditory or visual stimuli alone.Watson R, Latinus M, Charest I, Crabbe F, Belin P. People-selectivity, audiovisual integration and heteromodality in the superior temporal sulcus. Cortex. 2014;50(100):125–136. doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2013.07.011 This study also identified this same region to preferentially activated in the processing of stimuli associated with people, such as faces and voices. Another fMRI study found that the neural representations of audiovisual integration, non-verbal emotional signals, voice sensitivity, and face sensitivity are all localized to separate regions of the superior temporal sulcus.Kreifelts B, Ethofer T, Shiozawa T, Grodd W, Wildgruber D. Cerebral representation of non-verbal emotional perception: fMRI reveals audiovisual integration area between voice- and face-sensitive regions in the superior temporal sulcus. Neuropsychologia. 2009;47(14):3059-3066. doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.07.001. Likewise, this study also noted that the area most sensitive to voice is located in the trunk section of the superior temporal sulcus, the area most sensitive to facial expressions is located in the posterior terminal ascending branch, and audiovisual integration of emotional signals occurs in regions that overlap with face and voice recognition areas at the bifurcation of the superior temporal sulcus.  Biological motion  The superior temporal sulcus has been found to have a unique sensitivity to observable manifestations of movement understanding, which suggest that the superior temporal sulcus is heavily involved in the recognition of movements and gestures required for normal social information processing in humans. In fMRI studies evaluating the interpretation of a point-light display that represents a moving human figure as a pattern of dots, a cluster of significant brain activity was observed in the posterior superior temporal sulcus of the right hemisphere in subjects that correctly identified the biological motion being shown in the point-light display.Herrington JD, Nymberg C, Schultz RT. Biological motion task performance predicts superior temporal sulcus activity. Brain Cogn. 2011;77(3):372-381. doi:10.1016/j.bandc.2011.09.001. Furthermore, movement perception and movement interpretation are believed to be localized in different regions of the superior temporal sulcus, with movement perception being processed in a posterior region of the superior temporal sulcus and movement understanding being processed in a more anterior region.  Neurological disorders  In studies on dysfunctional social cognition in neurological disorders, such as what is observed in people with high- functioning autism, the role of the superior temporal sulcus in processing social information has been identified as the mechanism that lies at the root of these impairments in social interpretation. Children with high-functioning autism have been reported to have no significant change in superior temporal sulcus activation for biological motion compared to non-biological motion, which suggests that the superior temporal sulcus is not specifically activated in the processing of biological motion like it is in children without autism. In subjects with schizophrenia, another neurological disorder associated with significant impairments to social cognition, these social impairment have been linked to an alteration in posterior superior temporal sulcus activation in affective theory of mind, emotional recognition, and the interpretation of neutral facial expressions. More specifically, it was determined that schizophrenic subjects exhibited hyperactivity within the posterior superior temporal sulcus of the right hemisphere in processing neutral facial expressions, but they also exhibited hypoactivity within this same region for emotional recognition and affective theory of mind. This same study also found impaired connectivity between the right and left hemispheres of the posterior superior temporal sulcus in the processing of affective theory of mind. Another recent study showed an inverse relationship between glutamate concentrations within the superior temporal sulcus and neuroticism scores assessed by questionnaire was found in subjects with schizophrenia, which suggests that elevations in glutamate concentrations may act as a compensatory mechanism that allows those with schizophrenia to prevent neuroticism. Various disorders of the STS have been documented in which patients fail to recognize a certain stimulus, but still exhibit subcortical processing of the stimulus, this is known as an agnosia. Pure auditory agnosia (agnosia without aphasia) is found in a patients who can't identify non-speech sounds such as coughing, whistling, and crying but have no deficit in speech comprehension. Speech agnosia is known as an incapability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production, and reading ability. Patients show a recognition of the familiarity of a word, but are not able to recall its meaning. Phonagnosia is characterized as an inability to recognize familiar voices, while having other auditory abilities. Patients exhibited a double dissociation with either an inability to match names or faces with a certain famous voice, or to discriminate familiar voices from unfamiliar ones. Visual agnosia can be broken into separate disorders in regard to what is being recognized. An inability to recognize written words is known as alexia or word blindness, while an inability to recognize familiar faces is known as prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia has been shown to have a similar double dissociation as phonagnosia in that some patients show an impairment of memory for familiar faces while others show impairment when discriminating familiar faces from unfamiliar ones.

Commissioned by the Opera dancer Marie-Madeleine Guimard, it was designed by the architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux in the neoclassical style, then built from 1770 to 1773. It is noted for having boasted its own 500-seat theater. The building was ultimately demolished as part of the massive urban renewal program headed by Baron Haussmann, which largely reshaped the city during the Second French Empire. History The facade of the Hôtel Guimard Hôtel Guimard, dessin de Jean-Baptiste Maréchal Map of the Hotel Guimard, with a theatre above the entrance Marie-Madeleine Guimard was a ballerina for the Paris Opera. She made her fortune as mistress of the Prince de Soubise and had a hôtel particulier (or mansion) in Pantin, a Paris suburb. The Hôtel Guimard was nicknamed the \\"Terpsichore temple\\", in reference to Mlle Guimard (Terpsichore was the Muse of dance). The site featured a sculpture titled Terpsichore Crowned by Apollo, a low relief of the Muse of Dance riding a chariot \\"pulled by Amours surrounded by Bacchantes and Wildlife and followed by the graces of choreography\\". Above the entrance was a ballet hall with a ceiling painted by Taravel, painter of the king. The theater was a 500-seat masterpiece. It opened on December 8, 1772, ending the shows of the hôtel of Pantin (which included her previous theatre). The first dinner in the hotel was banned by the Archbishop of Paris and the food was taken to a priest for distribution to the poor. Mlle Guimard welcomed as courtesan the financier Jean-Joseph de Laborde, the bishop of Taranto, and other important persons. In a career of luxury, she offered three dinner parties a week, according to Edmond de Goncourt. One dinner was for the greatest of lords and those of the highest consideration at Court; a second dinner invited writers, artists, and wits that all but rivaled the salon of Mme Geoffrin; a third dinner was devoted to all the most ravishing and lascivious young women. Mlle Guimard uniquely sold her hotel by holding a lottery, selling 2,500 tickets at 120 francs each. On 25 May 1785, the Countess of Lau won the hotel with only one ticket. Lau then sold the hotel for 500,000 francs to the banker Jean-Frédéric Perregaux. It was here that Jacques Laffitte began his career as a banker, under the tutelage of Perregaux.

Mission The dual mission of the 269th Combat Communications Squadron is to rapidly deploy an integrated force capable of establishing initial and build-up Command and Control (C2); Communications; and Information Operations (IO) capabilities to support the war fighter during times of war and Federal/State agencies during Homeland Emergencies. History =USAAC/WWII= The 269th Combat Communications Squadron is the oldest combat communications squadron in the Air Force and was formed three months after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent United States entry into World War II. It became the 77th Signal Platoon (Aviation), an Army communications element at Davis Monthan Field, Tucson, Arizona, with a complement of one person, a Private Bunn, who later became First Sergeant. The unit had an authorized strength of approximately two hundred personnel with all the tools and equipment essential to provide communications for a typical fighter or bomber unit headquarters and its detachments. The company trained at three stateside bases, Gowen Field, Idaho; Wendover Field, Utah; and Rapid City Army Air Base, South Dakota, before transferring to England in June 1943. They were renamed the 1077th Signal Company, Service Group and were assigned to Camp Cheddington, England. The 8th Air Force Composite Command was the first of a series of fighter and bomber units served by the company in England and Northern Ireland. Moving to Belgium with 1st Bombardment Division and the VIII AF Fighter Command in February 1945, the company was based at Charleroi, Belgium. From there they dispatched personnel to install and operate beacons and communications systems across the expanding front in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Germany. They moved forward with the fliers and even participated in an infantry attack at Frislar.USAF FOIA Request 200901064F, 1 June 2009 =Post-WWII= Returning to England in May 1945, the organization was assigned as a demobilization unit until its own inactivation, 4 December 1945. The 1077th was reconstituted as the 605th Signal Light Construction Company of the Ohio National Guard on 24 May 1946. However, sufficient people to achieve federal recognition were not assembled at its new home at the state Armory on East Mulberry Street in Springfield until 29 January 1948. Three officers and fifteen men were assigned to the new company. The mission and name changed, concurrent with the construction of a new facility at Springfield Municipal Airport. The buildings were located across the road from the bustling airport on land which became the home of a much larger unit, the 178th Fighter Group. The 605th was renamed the 269th Communications Squadron Operations, effective 1 July 1952. In October 1952, it was assigned to the newly formed 251st Communications Group.

History In 1899, the border between Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Egypt was defined by the condominium treaty to run along the 22nd degree north of latitude. However, access to the area north of the border along the Nile River and consequently the administration of the population of the area were easier from Sudan. Therefore, in 1902 a new administrative border was established, deviating north of the 22nd degree north of latitude along the Nile river, thereby placing this area under Sudanese administration. Besides the Wadi Halfa Salient, there are two more areas where the administrative border deviated from the 22nd degree north of latitude, both to the east of Wadi Halfa: the Hala'ib Triangle on the Red Sea coast, north of the original 1899 border, and the much smaller area around Bir Tawil, south of the original border. Political situation Egypt claims the more favorable original border of 1899 along the 22nd degree north of latitude and therefore claims both the Hala'ib Triangle and the Wadi Halfa Salient, but not the Bir Tawil area. Since Sudan claims the amended border of 1902, it claims the same areas as Egypt, while no country claims the Bir Tawil area, making it de facto a terra nullius. While there have been disputes about the Hala'ib Triangle and military occupation by Egypt, the small area of the Wadi Halfa Salient remained out of the headlines because most of the area is flooded by Lake Nasser. Geography The Wadi Halfa Salient is roughly wide and stretches finger-shaped on both sides of the original course of the Nile to the north into Egyptian territory, with a total area of . Because of the construction of the Aswan Dam and the flooding of Lake Nasser most of the area was flooded, affecting most of the villages of the area and the ancient city of Faras. Some of the people were resettled to New Halfa in the Butana region. After a detailed map of 1953, before the flooding, 52 villages could be counted in the area, of which 24 were west of the Nile River (17 with names on the map), and 29 east of the river (12 with names), and one unnamed village on the Faras Island in the river. The largest town and only one with a population exceeding 2000 was Dubayrah ().Dubayrah NF 36-5 \\"Series P502, Edition 2-AMS\\", Army Map Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers A land area of only about remains in the salient, most of it on the eastern banks, a desolate rocky area nearly devoid of vegetation.

He was regarded as one of the leading and pioneering permaculture authorities in Europe. He was born Patrick Vickers, in Devizes, Wiltshire, and grew up on a smallholding in Somerset before studying agriculture at Shuttleworth College in Bedfordshire. After several years working in agriculture in the Middle East and Africa, he returned to Somerset and bought a flower-rich hay meadow, the White Field near Butleigh, to maintain it as a nature reserve. Thereafter he took his name from the field, which, after 25 years, he transferred to the care of the Somerset Wildlife Trust. As well as producing vegetables, Whitefield undertook a variety of traditional country crafts, and for a period was a prominent member of the Ecology Party (forerunner of the Green Party of England and Wales) and was involved in the early years of the Glastonbury music festival. He was an influential British exponent of the permaculture system from 1990, developing his own approach. He was interviewed in several television programmes advocating permaculture, including the BBC's It's Not Easy Being Green (2006) and A Farm for the Future (2008).\\"The Author\\", Patrick Whitefield, The Earth Care Manual (Permanent Publications, 2004) He was the author of Tipi Living (1987), Permaculture in a Nutshell (1993), How to Make a Forest Garden (1996), The Earth Care Manual (2004), and The Living Landscape, How to Read it and Understand it (2010). The Minimalist Gardener (2017) was posthumously published. He taught on various courses in England, including at Ragmans Lane Farm in Gloucestershire and created the first online permaculture design course in Britain.

(100 mg from 200 kg dry rice husk). It has been shown to be produced in high concentrations by the roots of rice seedlings. The production of momilactone B has also been induced in response to infection by blast fungus (Pyricularia oryzae) or irradiated with UV light. More recently it has been shown to be a potential chemotherapeutic agent against human colon cancer. Biosynthesis Of the 15 phytoalexins that have been isolated from rice, 14, including momilactone B, are diterpenes commonly biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). Research on the synthetic pathway for momilactone B has found it involves a set of enzymes that are encoded by genes located on chromosome 4. The first step in the biosynthesis of momilactone B is the cyclization of GGDP to syn-copalyl diphosphate (syn-CDP), a type B cyclization. This is initiated by the addition of a proton to the terminal olefin bond of GGDP. The genes encoding for syn-CDP synthase was found by Otomo et al.. in 2004. This was labeled as OsCyc1 (Oryza sativa Cyclase 1). According to the rice genome database, OsCyc1 corresponds to OsCPS4 (AL662933) found in chromosome 4 (14.3cM) discovered by Sakamoto et al.. in 2004. The second step is the cyclization of syn-CDP to 9β-pimara-7,15-diene. This step is initiated by the elimination of the diphosphate group, a type A cyclization. The genes encoding for the type A cyclase were found by Otomo et al.. in 2004. It is suggested that OsKS4, located on chromosome 4 (14.3cM) is one of the genes responsible for phytoalexin biosynthesis. After UV-radiation, OsKS4 mRNA levels rise drastically in response to the attack. syn-CDP cyclization to 9β-pimara-7,15-diene Further oxidation of the 9β-pimara-7,15-diene compound followed by lactone and lactol formation yields momilactone B. Though the gene sequence of these oxidations is unknown, P450 monooxygenase genes have been identified near the cyclase genes on chromosome 4. Oxidation of 9β-pimara-7,15-diene to Momilactone B  Stereochemistry  The stereochemistry reported by Kato et al. in 1973 is different than that shown in the biosynthesis references. The stereochemistry of momilactone B shown here is based on the biosynthesis references. There are no known papers correcting the stereochemistry from the isolation paper.

Subsequent to the destruction of Nelson's Pillar in Dublin (1808–1966), Montreal's pillar now stands as the second-oldest \\"Nelson's Column\\" in the world, after the Nelson Monument in Glasgow.Nelson's Column#Other monuments to Nelson It is also the city's oldest monument and is the oldest war monument in Canada. The public funds raised for building the monument were collected from both British and French Montrealers.

The east face of Nelson's Column According to popular memory (and since repeated by Rumilly and Leacock), Montrealers first became aware of Nelson's death on a snowy New Year's Eve in 1805. As river navigation was closed for the winter, word reached Montreal overland via New York City, when a ball being hosted by Samuel Gerrard was interrupted by a messenger. Gerrard immediately went down to the Exchange Coffee House to publicly relay the news, while proposing that a monument be built to honour both Nelson's memory and his victory over Napoleon's fleet.Making Public Pasts: The Contested Terrain of Montreal's Public Memories, 1891-1930. By Allan Gordon, 2001 A number of people subscribed on the spot and a subscription list was left open in the Old Court House, where over the following weeks further names were added.Passé vivant de Montréal (1993), by Eric McLean and Richard Wilson In January 1806, a committee of five, consisting of John Richardson, Louis Chaboillez, John Forsyth, Sir James Monk, Sir John Johnson and John Ogilvie, was formed in conjunction with Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Thomas Forsyth and John Gillespie, in London, to raise public funds and organise the building of the monument. Among the principal contributors to the fund were Gerrard himself, Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, William McGillivray, members of the Panet family (including Jean-Antoine Panet), Joseph Frobisher, Jacques-Philippe Saveuse de Beaujeu, Alexander Henry, the Beaubien family, James McGill, the Fleury desChambault family, John Ogilvy and the \\"gentlemen of Saint-Sulpice\\".Making Public Pasts: The Contested Terrain of Montreal's Public Memories, 1891-1930. By Allan Gordon, 2001 The Sulpicians, like many other French Canadians, strongly disapproved of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic regime, thereby regarding the destruction of Napoleon's navy at Trafalgar as \\"a triumph of virtue\\".Passé vivant de Montréal (1993), by Eric McLean and Richard Wilson The magistrates of Montreal obtained from Governor Sir James Craig a plot of land that had a few years earlier constituted part of the formal gardens of the Château Vaudreuil, built in 1723 for Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil. The Chateau burned down in 1803 and the space formerly occupied by the gardens had been turned into a public square, known as New Market Place, before being renamed for Jacques Cartier in 1847.The Nelson Monument in Montreal (1808) Philip V. Allingham, Contributing Editor, Victorian Web; Lakehead University (Canada) The committee had contracted the firm of Coade & Sealy in London to design and build an \\"amazing\\" monument that would withstand all weather. The column was made of grey compact limestone, while the statue and ornaments were made using the firm's own invention, Coade stone.Hochelaga depicta: the early history and present state of the city and island of Montreal (1839), by Newton Bosworth It was shipped in parts to Montreal, arriving in April 1808. William Gilmore, a local stonemason who had contributed £7 towards its construction, was then hired to assemble its seventeen parts and the foundation base was laid on 17 August 1809.Making Public Pasts: The Contested Terrain of Montreal's Public Memories, 1891-1930. By Allan Gordon, 2001 General Sir Gordon Drummond had supplied eight pieces of cannon to support the iron chain which had been originally placed around the base. The final cost of the column amounted to just under £1,300. The masonry came to £523; the ornaments, £468.12; the design, estimate and plans, £58; the iron railings £66.18.11.Hochelaga depicta: the early history and present state of the city and island of Montreal (1839), by Newton Bosworth The Montreal pillar has been described as the first monumental column to be raised to Nelson anywhere in the world, or at least anywhere in the British Empire. In fact, construction of Dublin's Nelson's Pillar had been completed with the addition of Nelson's statue toward the end of August or in early September 1809, whereas work on erecting the Montreal Column had just begun on August 17. Dublin at that time was not only within the British Empire but also within the recently created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Dublin Pillar had also been financed by public subscription. It was destroyed by Irish republican extremists on March 8, 1966.Dublin’s Fallen Hero:The Long Life and Sudden Death of Nelson’s Pillar (1809-1966) , by Dennis Kennedy. Ormeau Books, Belfast 2013. The Horatio Nelson statue that originally stood atop Nelson's column in Place Jacques Cartier was relocated to the Montreal History Museum in 1997 for preservation. A copy now stands atop the column in its place. Rededication ceremony, 1900 In October 1900, a rededication ceremony took place at the column following its restoration. The speakers represented several of Montreal's ethnic communities. Louis François Georges Baby, a representative of an old French-Canadian family descended from Jacques Babie, told those gathered that the monument had originally been raised through contributions from both the British and French communities in Montreal. Another speaker, Henri Césaire Saint-Pierre, claimed that the original idea had been a French-Canadian one, as suggested by 'Girard', referring to Samuel Gerrard, who was in fact an Anglo-Irishman. Saint-Pierre continued, stating that the monument stood as a lesson for \\"duty performed\\", irrespective of nationality. Other speakers were Judge Curran who represented the Irish community, and Lord Strathcona who represented the Scots-Quebecers.Making Public Pasts: The Contested Terrain of Montreal's Public Memories, 1891-1930. By Allan Gordon, 2001 Controversy As it is a monument to a British officer who fought against France in a city that is predominantly French-speaking, it has garnered its share of controversy. In 1890, a Quebec nationalist faction plotted to blow up the column. In 1930, Francophone Montrealers responded to Nelson's presence by erecting a statue in a nearby city square (now known as Vauquelin Square), commemorating Jean Vauquelin, a French naval officer who fought during the Seven Years' War. Still, many French Canadians continued to object to Nelson's presence. In 1997, the City of Montreal proposed moving the monument to a distant Anglophone district, but public opposition kept Montreal's oldest monument in its original place.The Rough Guide to Montreal, 2004 Other monuments to Nelson * 1806: The first civic monument to be erected was a 44-metre high obelisk, the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green in Glasgow, Scotland. * 1806: Nelson's Tower in Forres, Moray. * 1808: Nelson's Pillar in Dublin, Ireland, was destroyed by a bomb in 1966. * 1809: Statue of Horatio Nelson, Birmingham by Richard Westmacott, in the Bull Ring. * 1809: A column, topped with a decorative urn, in the Castle Green, Hereford.

(2003), \\"Intercultural Communication Theories\\", in: Gudykunst, William B (ed.), Cross-Cultural and Intercultural Communication, 167-189, Thousand Oaks: Sage. Decision-making Developed in the 1990s by John G. Oetzel it focuses on decision-making within groups integrating also the Vigilant Interaction Theory (Hirokawa and Rost) as well as the Face Negotiation Theory by Ting-Toomey. It takes the influence of culture on group processes as a basis and it depends on social interactions among group members. The purpose of this study which is to determine whether relationship between group interaction quality and group decision performance can be generalized to established organizational groups.Randy Hirokawa; Kathryn Rost,\\"Effective Group Decision Making in Organizations: Field Test of the Vigilant Interaction Theory\\", February 1992 Thus the theory presents different group constellations and their way of making decisions. Emphasizing the possible success Oetzels theory belongs to the theories focusing on effective outcomes. Oetzel states that groups making decisions can be homogeneous, i.e. monocultural or heterogeneous, i.e. multicultural. Within multicultural groups, there exist different decision-making strategies with the individuals due to the diverse cultural backgrounds. These different strategies may lead to conflicts in the process. The diverse backgrounds of the individuals will also result in different strategies for dealing with those conflicts. The effectiveness of a decision is dependent on its quality and appropriateness. Vigilant Interaction Theory describes the group decision- making process as a series of interrelated sub-decisions leading to the final decision. According to the theory the quality of the final decision is based on 1)analysis of the problem/ situation 2) establishment of goals and objectives 3)evaluation of positive and negative qualities of the available choices.Randy Hirokawa, [\\"Effective Group Decision Making in Organizations Field Test of Vigilant Interaction Theory\\"], Management Communication Quarterly, 1992 This theory shows that group decision performance is largely dependent on the wise group decision-makings from social interactions. Propositions =1 through 7= The theory contains 14 propositionsOetzel, John G. (1995), \\"Intercultural small groups: An effective decision-making theory\\", in Wiseman, Richard L (ed.), Intercultural communication theory, 247-270, Thousands Oaks: Sage. as a core. Of those, the first half focuses on the influence of input on the process of decision-making. Here Oetzel assumes that individual members of homogeneous groups activate either independent self-construals (such members emphasize the quality decision and are not primarily interested in relationships among members) or interdependent self construals (those members are concerned for cooperation and others; the decision is secondary). Therefore homogeneous groups consisting of members that activate independent will take longer to reach a decision. The process is less cooperative and will have more conflicts than with homogeneous groups whose members activate interdependent self-construals. In addition to that, heterogeneous groups will less likely reach consensus than homogeneous groups since with homogeneous groups the single members are more committed to their group and that their contributions are treated more equally than in heterogeneous groups. Furthermore Oetzel claims that groups were the majority of members activate independent self-construals will most likely use dominating conflict-strategies, whereas with groups were most members use interdependent self-construals will use strategies of avoiding, compromising or obliging when dealing with conflicts. =8 through 14= Propositions 8 to 14 focus on the influence of the process on the outcome, i.e. on the decision. Those groups that use cooperative styles of conflict-management such as compromising make more effective decisions than those who use avoiding or competing styles as they put the group before the personal goals and have more creative solutions. Decisions will also be more effective in groups were members activate their personal identities. In groups were members activate social identities decisions will less effective since the different ideas of members are not used to their full extent and participation is unequal. This leads to the assumption that the more equal members in their groups are and the more committed individuals are to their group and to the decision the more effective the outcome will be. Therefore decisions reached by consensus are more effective than those made by majority for example. Finally the VIT’s “functional requisites” can predict the quality of decisions in mono- and multicultural groups. Those groups who meet these requisites will make decisions of higher quality. However, not all propositions have been evaluated yet and Oetzel does not consider his theory finished.

After the defeat of uprising people, the survivors fled to all parts of Bulgaria; some of them settled along the Danube river near Lom (Lom Palanka, or Roman name of Almus). Because cholera broke out, some of the people moved to the local blacksmith, who lived 5 km from the river, where now lies the village - and from there is the origin of the name Kovachitsa.

There is also a monument, erected in 1966 for the local agricultural consolidation project. Heers has a long history. The hamlet is mentioned in books from the Middle Ages. Also, archaeological artefacts from the Bronze Age and the Roman Empire have been unearthed near the hamlet.

This would be the ridge between the Run and Gender streams.Coenen, Jean (2006) Veldhoven: Van Toterfout tot heden. p. 82 History =Prehistory= The surroundings of Heers were already inhabited by humans in prehistoric times. In the woods near the road Locht, in the direction of the village Steensel, are some preserved tumuli located. The teacher and amateur archaeologist Petrus Panken was the first to report the existence of these tumuli, in 1845. He searched thirteen mounds and discovered urns filled with charcoal and cremated remains. The head teacher in Veldhoven, Cornelis Rijken, also found a great number of urns in this region in 1910. The first systematic research was conducted by Albert van Giffen in 1948. The ten tumuli that he reconstructed are known as the Group Heibloem. The tumuli are originating from a period of time between the Middle Bronze Age until the Iron Age (1500 - 50 BC).Bijnen, Jacques (2005) Veldhoven, 4000 jaar geschiedenis van Oerle, Meerveldhoven, Veldhoven en Zeelst. p. 25 =Roman Empire= Archaeological remains from the Roman Empire were found near Heers. On May 15, 1871, the amateur archaeologist Petrus Panken recovered several fragments of small terracotta sculptures, including a nearly undamaged sculpture of Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt. The sculpture, dated 175 AD, is 21.6 centimetres tall and portrays Diana with a quiver on her back and a dog at her side. It was donated in 1872 to the Noordbrabants Museum in 's-Hertogenbosch, where it is still preserved.Coenen, Jean (2006) Veldhoven: Van Toterfout tot heden. p. 31 In 1909, the head teacher Cornelis Rijken recommended to conduct an official archaeological investigation into the Roman remains near Heers. This investigation was led by Jan Hendrik Holwerda, an archaeologist of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, the national archaeological museum of the Netherlands. The investigation unearthed traces of a canal, as part of a Roman watchtower. This military post was probably constructed around the year 100 and further fortified around the year 200.Bijnen, Jacques (2005) Veldhoven, 4000 jaar geschiedenis van Oerle, Meerveldhoven, Veldhoven en Zeelst. p. 31 =Middle Ages= Near the road Oeienbosdijk, northwest of Heers, was a row grave field located during the age of the Franks. This grave field was probably in use from the sixth century until the end of the seventh century. It was discovered in 1970 during the construction of the motorway A67. Twenty five graves and three burial sites were investigated.Bijnen, Jacques (2005) Veldhoven, 4000 jaar geschiedenis van Oerle, Meerveldhoven, Veldhoven en Zeelst. p. 47 From the Middle Ages until the beginning of the twentieth century, Heers consisted only of a few farms along the stream Run. Surrounding these farms were large moors, such as the Steenselse Heide and the Broekhovense Heide. One of these farms was the Oyvaersnest, which stands for stork nest in Old Dutch. Its premises were cultivated in 1465. This farm was located between Heers and the hamlet Heiberg.

The hamlet lies at the Heerseweg, which is the main road between Veldhoven Dorp and the Volmolen watermill near Waalre. =Nature and landscape= Directly west of Heers lies the complex of the hotel and congress centre Koningshof. Here is also the forest area known as the Sprankelse Bossen located, which stretches all the way up to the village of Steensel. Ten reconstructed tumuli can be found in this forest. Part of the forest is known under the name Heersche Heide', which refers to the moor area that was present here before the land was cultivated.IVN Veldhoven Vessem Sprankelse Bossen East of Heers lay the swimming area and campsite 't Witven. South of Heers are some agricultural areas situated along the stream the Run. Further south, near the road Volmolenweg, lies the nature area the Vlasroot. This area consists of two lakes and a fish-pond.IVN Veldhoven Vessem Vlasrootvennen Monuments Chapel built in 1990 The chapel located at the street Westerveldseweg, dedicated to Mary, was built in 1990 by the citizen militia or schutterij St. Caecilia of the residential area Veldhoven Dorp. A Marian grotto was present on this spot from 1935 until approximately 1960. The monument for the local agricultural consolidation project was erected on the square of Heers in 1966. It refers to the agricultural consolidation that took place here between 1960 and 1965. What triggered the consolidation was the construction of the motorway A67, which crossed many plots north of Heers. The stream the Run was engineered and all the plots along the stream were also consolidated in the process.Coenen, Jean (2006) Veldhoven: Van Toterfout tot heden. p. 420 References Category:Populated places in North Brabant Category:Veldhoven ","title":"Heers, Netherlands"},{"id":"23158960","text":"Newtown is a former settlement in Mariposa County, California.

He wrote a \\"letter from Hollywood\\" for the British Film Review magazine from 1979 to 1994, and he wrote a monthly book review column for Classic Images from 1989 to 2001. He is a member of the editorial board of the American Film Institute Catalog. Biography Born in Birmingham, England, on 7 November 1944, Slide began his professional involvement with the cultural and historical field of films in the mid-1960s, serving as honorary secretary of the Society for Film History Research and co- founding and serving as the first editor of the newsletter of the still-active Cinema Theatre Association. In 1968, he became assistant editor of International Film Guide and editorial assistant on the film publications of Tantivy Press. That same year, he co-founded The Silent Picture a quarterly devoted to the art and history of the silent film, which he edited until its demise in 1974. In 1970, in conjunction with the London Film Festival, Slide organized Britain's, and the world's, first silent film festival, an eighteen- day event at the National Film Theatre. In 1971, Slide was named a Louis B. Mayer Research Associate with the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies in Beverly Hills. The following year, he went to Washington, D.C. to set up the American Film Institute Catalog: Feature Films, 1911–1920, and subsequently became the AFI's associate film archivist. In 1975, he moved to Los Angeles, becoming resident film historian of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, responsible for most of its educational and cultural activities. He left the Academy in 1986 and co-owned Producers Library Service, one of the two oldest and largest independent stock footage libraries in the United States from 1986–1990. He is now an independent film scholar, archivist and consultant. Slide published his first book, Early American Cinema, in 1970 (it was subsequently revised and rewritten in 1994), and since then has been a prolific writer on little known areas of entertainment history. Among his most prominent works are The Big V: A History of the Vitagraph Company (1976, revised 1987), Great Pretenders: A History of Female and Male Impersonation in the Performing Arts (1986), Nitrate Won’t Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States (1992), Before Video: A History of the Non-Theatrical Film (1992), The Hollywood Novel (1995), DeToth on DeToth: Put the Drama in Front of the Camera (1997), Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses (2002), and Lost Gay Novels (2003). He was the first to document the prominence of women directors in the American silent film industry with Early Women Directors (1977), which was subsequently revised and rewritten as The Silent Feminists (1996). Slide went on to edit The Memoirs of Alice Guy Blaché (1986), the autobiography of the world's first female director, and to write Lois Weber: The Director Who Lost Her Way in History (1996), the first and only biography of America's first native-born woman director. Slide's 1986 work, The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary was named outstanding reference source of the year by the American Library Association. The sequel volume, The International Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary (1989) was named outstanding academic book of the year by Choice magazine. The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville (1994) was named outstanding academic book of the year by Choice magazine, a best reference book of the year by Library Journal and outstanding reference source of the year by the American Library Association. His work as a writer and editor led Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times in to describe Slide as “a one-man publishing phenomenon\\". However, writing and editing are not his only attributes. He is a frequent “talking head” on film, television and DVD documentaries. He has provided commentary for DVD releases from 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. He has also produced, written and directed a number of documentaries on silent film personalities: Portrait of Blanche Sweet (1982), Vi [Viola Dana]: Portrait of a Silent Star (1988), Karl Brown's Adventures with D.W. Griffith (1990), and The Silent Feminists: America’s First Women Directors (1993). Slide is also known as an appraiser of entertainment memorabilia, with a client list ranging from Ralph Edwards Productions to Gregory Peck. Slide conducted oral histories with many silent film celebrities, and these are available at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and elsewhere. In 1990, Slide was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters by Bowling Green University. At that time, he was hailed by Lillian Gish, on whom he had compiled a monograph for the British Film Institute back in 1969, as \\"our preeminent historian of the silent film.” References External links independentfilmscholar.com Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:English writers Category:British film historians Category:Film theorists ","title":"Anthony Slide"},{"id":"23158982","title":"Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography"},{"id":"23158987","text":"Brett Hicks-Maitland (born 11 March 1978 in Adelaide) is an Australian actor.

Roman Empire The hills of Mokresh, from where the fertile plains start, have been once inhabited by the Thracian Moesi and by the Romans. There are still traces from a Roman residence in the park “Žir”, as well as an old Roman cemetery nearby. The most famous artifact (nowadays in Sofia Archeological Museum) is the marble gravestone of a Roman soldier. But excavations and research have not been carried out so far. Only the treasure-hunters know what the ancient sites contain. Small Paris Once upon a time, people used to call Mokresh a European village—because many of the natives studied in the cities and abroad, and there were many fashionably clothed men and women. The young village residents used to regularly go to the port in Lom to watch the passengers on the steamboats from Europe. They imitated the design of the clothes and the manner of speaking. The more affluent landowners from Mokresh started building their houses in a European style of architecture. That’s why, the locals named Mokresh the “Small Paris”. That was in the first half of the 20th century. Pop Puncho The most famous citizen is Pope Puncho. He made one of the first copies of the Old Bulgarian History by Paisius of Hilendar in the 19th century. Mokresh has its place in the National Revival history mainly through the activity of Pop Puncho Kuzdin, a remarkable person for his time. Born in the village, the priest made one of the first copies of the “Istoria slaviyanobulgarska” by Paisii Hilendarski. This copy was later included in the Bulgarian homilies from 1796. There are stories about Saint John of Rila, parables about Adam and Eve, the Birth of Christ, a short novel about the Russian tsar Peter the Great, all narrated simply and with love for Bulgaria. In his book he painted images of the Virgin and the Saints, as well a self- portrait. In the day, Puncho the priest taught the Mokresh children in the monastery school founded by him, and at night he was writing his homilies. Nowadays, this collection of 400 pages is preserved in the National library of Sofia. The digital edition of this book has been included in the European digital library.

Shurbagi building Downtown Cairo ( , \\"middle of town\\"), has been the urban center of Cairo, Egypt since the late 19th century, when the district was designed and built. History Downtown Cairo was designed by prestigious French architects who were commissioned by Khedive Ismail during his visit to Paris, and since then he wanted to make the Egyptian Kingdom capital better than Paris and to be the jewel of the orient. It was he who stressed the importance of European style urban planning in Cairo, to include broad, linear gridded streets, geometric harmony and modern European architectural style. It was once home to the prosperous elite of late 19th and early 20th century Cairo. It is a relic of a bygone era — Egypt's belle epoque — and demonstrates the vision for developing Egypt. Yet decades of neglect by the neighbourhood's landlords and tenants following the burning of most of Cairo's buildings during the popular Cairo fire incident prior the 1952 Revolution led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, and the ensuing departure of the upper classes, have left the splendor of its ornate edifices mired in decay. Lax enforcement of laws and regulations gave way to the entry of commercial establishments into the neighborhood, mostly with no regard to maintaining aesthetic harmony or preserving the historic buildings of Downtown Cairo. Now, most of the historic buildings within the area were renovated by the ministry Of housing, utilities and urban development.

At various times a meeting place for intellectuals and revolutionaries, the cafe witnessed many historically significant events over the 20th century. It is said to be where King Farouk saw his second wife, Nariman Sadek; where the perpetrator of the 1919 failed assassination attempt on Egypt's last Christian Prime Minister, Youssef Wahba Pasha lay in wait for his target; and where several members of the resistance during the 1919 revolution met the basement to organize their activities and print their flyers. Patrons included the iconic Egyptian Nobel Prize winner and nationalist novelist Naguib Mahfouz and the then-future president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Restoration Heritage groups have long called for a national campaign to preserve and restore the area's architectural legacy and beauty.

A graduate of the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, he received his Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Science. Fletcher played football and also participated in track and field during his time at school. Fletcher was an NFL undrafted free agent from 1998–2000, having opportunities with several NFL teams and eventually playing in the arena football league with the Los Angeles Avengers under Stan Brock. B & F Sports to Blueprint B & F Sports is the company founded by Jason Fletcher. Through B & F Sports, Jason Fletcher has been a certified National Football League contract advisor (NFL sports agent) since 2001. In 2003, Attorney Michael Walton was added to the staff as Vice President and a licensed certified National Football League contract advisor. In 2005, B&F Sports became a direct affiliation and council of The Cochran Firm (St. Louis) to assist in the representation of their clients, with over 20 offices nationwide, serving NFL players from almost every team in the league. In early 2009, Jason Fletcher formed a merger with NFL agent Fletcher Smith (Chicago based agent), owner of Chicago Sports Management by Blueprint Sports Group representing over 20 plus NFL players, including...Nate Irving, Mikel Leshoure, Weslye Saunders, and others. Highlights Michael Young - Generated a 3 year career with the Arizona Cardinals as a top backup linebacker, Young was considered athletically challenged and under productive in college… Christian Morton - Created opportunities with (8) NFL organizations (Patriots - 2004, Browns - 2004, Saints - 2004, Falcons - 2004 & 2005, Redskins - 2005 & 2006, Panthers - 2006 & 2007, Broncos - 2008, Titans - 2009). Morton’s career lasted longer than higher draft selections at the same position: Jeremy Lesueur (85th), Derrick Strait (76th), Will Poole (102nd), Michael Waddell (124th), Bruce Thornton (121st), Chris Thompson (150th), Jeff Shoate (152nd), Vontae Duff (170th), Greg Brooks (183rd), Dexter Wynn (192nd), Nathan Jones (205th), Alphonso Marshall (215th). Antonio Cromartie - Taken as a top pick for the San Diego Chargers 19th selection in the 2006 NFL Draft: after one college start in his career, a major knee injury, and zero football played in 2005, Cromartie received a richer contract (5 year - $13.5 million with $7.5 million guaranteed) than 18th selection Bobby Carpenter (5 year - $10.8 million with $7.7 million guaranteed) and 15th selection Tye Hill (5 year - $12.6 million with $7.21 million guaranteed). Brandon Williams - After completing his career at the University of Wisconsin as the all-time leader in receptions, the smallish/slow Williams still maintained a solid 5th round grade! Fletcher networked hard and aggressive with NFL personnel and took the politics head on, to sell his client as a valued top 100 prospect! Williams received a richer contract (4 year - $2.285 million with a signing bonus of $675,000 = 571.250 average per year and an 8% increase over the 2005 84th selection) than 83rd selection Anthony Smith (3 year - $1.564 million with a signing bonus of $521,500), 79th selection Jerious Norwood (4 year - $1.8 million with a signing bonus of $720,000), and 77th selection Jon Alston (3 year - $1.374 million with a signing bonus of $550,000). Leigh Bodden - The Patriots and Bodden were unable to reach an agreement on a contract extension prior to the start of free agency in March 2010. After visiting with the Houston Texans on March 8, 2010, Bodden was reported to have signed a deal with the Patriots the very next day. The following day, details of the contract were released: the total deal was $22 million over 4 years, with $10 million guaranteed. The contract was front-loaded, with nearly two-thirds ($14 million) of the net value coming in the first two years. Bodden's free agency was handled by agents Alvin Keels and Jason Fletcher II.

It is located on the bank of the river Ganges. The prime attraction is the Golghar granary that was built by Captain John Garstin in 1786. Patna Dental College and Hospital is also located here. History Until the early twentieth century, Bankipore (or Bankipur, or Banki Bazaar) was the administrative centre of the Patna Division of Bihar, which came under the rule of the British East India Company (EIC) following the battle of Buxar in 1764. Bankipore lies along an east–west axis on the south bank of the Ganges, some four kilometers west from the medieval Patna City, or Azimabad. The site is almost certainly the location of the ancient Magadhan and Maurya capital of Pataliputra. Its identification with Pataliputra was first noticed by Sir William Jones who was informed that Bankipore lay on the former confluence of the River Sone with the Ganges, a site that has shifted some distance upstream now-and one that matches Megasthenes' description. In 1774 the EIC ceded Banki Bazaar to the Austrian Ostend Company. Among the principal remains of the colonial period in Bankipore are the District Collectorate, the Civil Court, and mansions such as the impressive Darbhanga House (now the PG Deptt.Patna University, Patna), built in the late 19th century by the great philanthropist, the Maharaja of Darbhanga, Lachmaneshwar Singh. The Bankipore cemetery, which has the graves of minor Company officials and indigo planters, the Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library, founded by the Maulvi Khuda Bakhsh in 1891, and the Catholic Mission, are among the other historic sites of Bankipore. Bankipore is also notable for its several ghats, which include the old Jahaz Ghat, from where plied the daily ferry across the river, and the Darbhanga Ghat. One of the earliest educational institutions of the erstwhile Bengal Presidency, Rammohun Roy Seminary, a High English School, was set up at Bankipur in 1892 under the charge of Satis Chandra Chakravarti, a worker of the Bankipur Ashram of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. In 1912, Indian National Congress held its 27th session at Bankipore under the Presidency of Rao Bahadur Raghunath Narasinha Mudholkar from Amravati of Central Provinces and Berar. The name of this place goes to Islamic invader Mir Banki who attacked Bengal in 15th century and came to Patna in his campaign. In fiction The author E. M. Forster states\\"A Passage to India\\"E.M.Forster, Edited by Oliver Stallybrass 1978, Penguin Books Limited, Reprinted in Penguin Modern Classics 1982, p.338 that the city of Chandrapore, in his novel A Passage to India, \\"was suggested geographically by the town of Bankipore\\".

History Variety Unit is the only structure at Shelburne Museum that is original to the site. Built in 1835, the building was originally known as the Weed House, but was renamed Variety Unit to reflect the wide range of decorative arts exhibited there. Architecture The original brick structure, with its front-gable orientation and fully articulated pediment, reflects the style of Greek Revival architecture popular in the mid-19th century. However, the complex rambling interior composed of a series of one and two-room additions, constructed over time as the occupants required more space, embodies the New England tradition of \\"continuous architecture.\\" Variety Unit collections =Glass= Shelburne Museum's glass collection numbers nearly two thousand pieces dating from 1750 to 1900 and includes free-blown flasks, window glass, and mold-blown bottles and flasks; pattern glass plates, serving dishes and decorative piecesl colorful canes, rolling pins, marbles, \\"witch balls\\" and other whimseys; and miniature glass doll dishes. The Garrison collection of American pattern glass goblets includes eleven hundred patterns. In addition the collection includes a wide range of patent medicine and apothecary bottles.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. =Ceramics= The finest ceramics in the Museum's collection include over 200 pieces of 19th-century English mochaware, several of which are recent acquisitions.http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=4 While the strength of the Shelburne Museum's collection is in utilitarian and fine tablewares, the figural ceramics are also of interest. Staffordshire animal figures, whimsical toby jugs, and a magnificent pair of Chelsea swans can also be seen in the Variety Unit. =Dolls and Dollhouses= Shelburne Museum's European and American dolls include bisque, papier-mâché, Parian, china, wax, wood and cloth pieces, most of them made between 1760 and 1930. About 400 dolls are on exhibition in Variety Unit in galleries re-designed in 2004 with new lighting and exhibition labels.http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=11 Exhibited with the dolls are 19th and 20th-century dollhouses; they include an English Gothic Revival house and the idiosyncratic Ramshackle Inn, a rambling American house with an artist's studio in the attic. Many American dolls of the 18th and 19th centuries were made at home of readily available materials, including wood, rags, clay, dried apples, corn husks, bottles and clay pipes. Until World War I, the majority of dolls sold in America were imported from England, France, and Germany. Joel Ellis of Springfield, Vermont made some of the first commercial American dolls with wooden bodies, patented jointed limbs, and pewter hands and feet. Izannah Walker of Rhode Island made cloth dolls with hand-painted faces and hair. Examples by both Ellis and Walker can be seen in the Variety Unit. Not all dolls were playthings. In the late 19th century French dollmakers such as Bru, Jumeau, and Steiner, and German dollmakers such as Kestner and Simon & Halbig – all represented in Shelburne Museum's collection – created elegant bisque-head dolls with large wide glass eyes, thick eyebrows, long lashes, cupid's bow lips, beautifully coiffed real hair and elaborate dresses of silk and other fine fabrics. Souvenir and keepsake dolls were popular products in many areas frequented by tourists. Dolls created entirely of different sizes and shapes of shells, for example, come from a number of French and English resort towns; a number of these fragile dolls may be seen in the Hat and Fragrance. English peddler dolls, which depict street vendors and their diverse wares, and American Indian dolls, complete with bead-decorated costumes are also represented in Shelburne's vast collection. =Pewter= Shelburne Museum's pewter collection offers an overview of French, German, Dutch, English, and American styles. Settlers brought pieces of pewter with them from abroad and many American merchants sold foreign pewter in their shops. It cost less than other metals, and in Europe its styles frequently copied popular silver designs. American artisans often relied on imported English and German pewter for stylistic inspiration. In fact, long after pewter had fallen out of fashion in Europe it was still being widely produced in America. =Scrimshaw= The American whaling industry dominated the world market in the nineteenth century. It peaked in 1850 when seven hundred American ships with over twenty thousand men sailed from the South Pacific to the Arctic in search of whales. Voyages could last up to five years because ships only returned when their holds were filled with barrels of whale oil. To pass the time, some sailors used the leftover whalebone to make homecoming gifts for their friends and loved ones. With saws and files they would first shape the whalebone. Then with needles or knives they would sketch designs into the surface. When the design was complete the sailors would ink them with lampblack or squid ink. While the best-known form of scrimshaw is the whale tooth decorated with engraved scenes, scrimshanders also fashioned shipboard tools, kitchen implements, domestic and needlework tools, and fashion accessories from whalebone and ivory. Tortoise shell, seashells, animal horn, pewter, silver, and exotic tropical woods gathered during the whaling journeys sometimes provided decorative accents. Shelburne Museum's scrimshaw collection offers a broad range of forms. A variety of teeth are decorated with whaling scenes, portraits, and patriotic motifs. A \\"Susan's tooth,\\" one of a handful engraved in the 1830s by Frederick Myrick aboard the ship Susan, is among the earliest documented scrimshaw in existence. Pieces intended as gifts to wives and sweethearts included corset busks (inserted in a slit at the front of a woman's corset to firm the bodice), small picks (used to pierce holes in cloth or as hair decorations), pie crimpers, knitting needles, a butter print, a sewing box, and a yarn- winding swift. =Automata= Automata are large (sometimes three feet tall), often comical wind-up toys with accompanying music that were displayed in parlors, especially in France, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum exhibits about 30 automata, including several particularly fine pieces by Gustave Vichy of Paris, France. The collection includes a drunken chef, a magician, a monkey drummer, a magician, an opium smoker, a woman at her toilette, and a clown walking on his hands. =Woodenware and food molds= North America's abundant forests supplied the raw materials that settlers used to create buildings and objects that ranged from baskets, barrels, and bowls, to carriages and boats. Household utensils, known as treen, comprised some of the most basic and common wooden objects. One of the most popular materials used to create treen were burls, which are dense, hard growths that form on tree trunks. The semi-circular burls typically required little shaping to form bowls and in addition to their strength, they often possessed highly patterned and attractive grains. Craftsmen would scoop out the interior of a burl by hand or, in later years with a lathe, to create a hollowed bowl. During the 19th century food molds became popular as a vehicle for both identification and decoration. Confectioners would use intricately carved wooden molds to form and decorate pastries and marzipan candies while bakers would pour their cake batters into carved molds such as the Museum's George Washington cake mold made by John Conger, a renowned New York carver. Dairy farmers would likewise use ornamental, circular stamps to mark their butter with their brand. =Other= The Variety Unit is also home to the glass canes, globlets, toby jugs, and trivets.

Bramber is a former barony whose original seat was the castle of Bramber and its village, overlooking the river Adur. History Created by William the Conqueror in the late 11th century, the rape of Bramber was separated out of the neighbouring rapes of Arundel and Lewes and entrusted to one of his knights, William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber. It was inserted so William de Braose could defend the Adur estuary, and a re-allocation of land to existing rapal owners became necessary. In population terms, the smallest of the three rapes making up Sussex's western division, its population in 1801 was 19,203, rising to 22,777 in 1811 and 30,113 in 1831. Location Location of Bramber within Sussex The rape of Bramber is a strip of territory running northwards from the coast to the border with Surrey in the north. It is bordered by the rape of Arundel to the west and the rape of Lewes to the east. It contains a variety of different landscape areas – coastal plain and the mouth of the river Adur in the south, the South Downs and the Weald north of that, including the westernmost part of the dense Forest Ridge, known in the rape of Bramber as St Leonard's Forest. In the neighbouring rape of Lewes, the Forest Ridge is known as Worth Forest. The rape contains five towns: Horsham, Shoreham-by-Sea, Steyning and most of the borough of Worthing, as well as the westernmost part of the borough of Crawley. Ifield was the parish in the far north-east of Bramber rape, and in its own north-east corner on Lowfield Heath grew the County Oak, which traditionally marked the Sussex–Surrey boundary, as well as the boundary between the rapes of Bramber and Lewes.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18405 The oak was cut down in the 1840s and is remembered today in the County Oak Retail Park in Crawley. The highest point in the rape is Chanctonbury Ring at tall. Historical population Relationship to West and East Sussex Until the creation of the rape of Bramber, Sussex had been divided into east and west at the River Adur, at least for the purposes of the church in Sussex (divided from at least the 11th century into the archdeaconry of Chichester and the archdeaconry of Lewes). After the creation of the rape of Bramber, the rape became one of the three rapes traditionally making up the western division of the county of Sussex (known as West Sussex since 1888 when East and West Sussex were given their own County Councils). For around 800 years its eastern boundary with the rape of Lewes formed the boundary between the eastern and western divisions of Sussex. The Mid Sussex district was created following the Local Government Act 1972, which transferred a large part of the rape of Lewes from East Sussex to West Sussex.

Almanac of African peoples & nations. Transaction Publishers, 1999 p. 280 The Jakhanke have historically constituted a specialized caste of professional Muslim clerics (ulema) and educators.Lamin O. Sanneh. The Jakhanke: The history of an Islamic clerical people of the Senegambia. London (1979) They are centered on one larger group in Guinea, with smaller populations in the Gambia, Senegal, and in Mali (near the Guinean border). In Guinea and nearby regions, they speak a Manding language called Jahanke, very similar to Western Malinke. Although technically considered members of the Soninke ethnic group (a Mandé people descending from the Bafour), the Jakhanke are commonly called Serakulle or Sarakolé in the Gambia and parts of Senegal, a variation of the Soninke name. Since the fifteenth century the Jakhanke clerical communities have constituted an integral part of region and have exercised a high level of economic and religious influence upon Soninke as well as related Manding speaking communities such as the (Dyula and Mandinka) in what is now Mali, Guinea, Senegal, and The Gambia. The endogamous Jakhanke clerics were influential in the diffusion of Islam among the Manding people in West Africa. While originally a religious caste of the Sarakolé, the Jahanke later facilitated the trans-Saharan trade routes as merchants, such as in coastal rice and slaves,, Quote: \\"From Kita, slaves were directed to Soninke buyers in Kaarta and in the Upper Senegal to Futanke in Bundu and Futa Toro, and to the Moors of the western desert. West of Kita, the Jahanke and Gajaaga Soninke were active traders. Within the commercial zone drained by the Middle Niger, most important slave markets of the Umarian period were at Baraweli, Segu.

The Journal of African History (1971), 12:11-24 In this way they are often compared with the Dyula, who formed a trade diaspora from the heartlands of the Mali Empire to the coast of what is today Côte d'Ivoire.Juliet E.K. Walker. \\"Trade Markets in Precolonial West and Central Africa...\\" in Thomas D. Boston(ed.) A Different Vision: Race and public policy. Volume 2 of African American Economic Thought Series: Routledge, 1997 pp.206-253, p.217 Historical background According to Levtzion, \\"The Mande-speaking Muslim traders, with whom the Portuguese negotiated on the Gambia were Diakhanke. The Diahkanke clans are of Soninke origin, and their traditions go back to Dinga, ancestor of the ruling dynasty of the ancient kingdom of Wagadu. They remember Dia in Massina as the town of their ancestor, Suware, a great marabout and a saint.\\" They later established Diakka-ba in Bambuk. The Jakhanke cultural ethos is best characterized by a staunch dedication to Islam, historical accuracy, rejection of jihad, non- involvement in political affairs and the religious instruction of young people. Formation of their regional Islamic identity began shortly after contact with Muslim Almoravid traders from North Africa in 1065, when Soninke nobles in Takrur (along the Senegal River in present-day Senegal) embraced Islam, being among the earliest sub-Saharan ethnic groups to follow the teachings of Muhammad. In Senegambia, the Jakhanke inhabited scattered towns and villages in Futa Jallon, Futa Bundu, Dentilia, Bambuk, and other places. By 1725, at least fifteen Jakhanke villages were located in what would become Bundu.Michael A. Gomez, Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad They claim to originate in Ja on the Niger River and Jahaba on the Bafing River, from which they moved to Bundu, Futa Jallon and Gambia. The Jakhanke were not primarily merchants, but agriculturists supported by slave labor. The various Jakhanke villages were independent of each other and of the local chiefs. The Jakhanke were committed to peaceful coexistence and refused to become engaged in politics or war. When threatened, they simply relocated their villages into safer territory. Often their villages enjoyed the privileges of sanctuary, judicial independence, and freedom from military service. Islamic practice The Jakhanke were noted Islamic scholars. They trace their spiritual ancestry to the sahabas of the Prophet who came to spread the message of Islam and inter marry with the people of north. Shiekh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari (d. 1525) a Muslim scholar who lived in the late fifteenth century, Karamba touba Diaby, Karang Foday mahmudou Jaylani Jaiteh, and many others. They adhere to Maliki fiqh, although they have been tolerant of customary practices. Primary importance was stressed on obedience to the murshid, or Sufi master, and of stages of initiation into the teachings of the community. Schooled in the bāṭin (secret) sciences, Jakhanke clerics interpreted dreams and gave amulets for protection, which continue to be highly prized items. They celebrate the mawlid an-nabī (birthday of the Prophet) and the ‘īdu l-fiṭr () feasts at the end of Ramadan and other Muslim holidays. Commerce and the spread of Islam Map of the ethnic groups of Senegal drawn by David Boilat (1853) Jakhanke people inherited their cleric roles and some pursued Islamic scholarship, as ulema or marabouts. Over time, they expanded into trade wherein their clerical and merchant roles were intertwined. Their trade included rice, salt, cloth, gold and slaves in the later centuries, first across the trans-Saharan caravan routes and later the trans-Atlantic market.John S Trimingham (1962), History of Islam in West Africa, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-33 In some regions, the Jakhanke monopolized their regional trading circuits, just like Zawaya clerics did in other markets. West Africa's pre-Islamic trading networks with North Africa and the Middle East grew with the arrival of Muslim traders after 8th-century. These traders formed mutually supporting communities as networks that the African historian Philip Curtin dubbed a \\"trading Diaspora.\\" One good example of such a trading diaspora is the Jakhanke tribe from the Upper Guinea. According to Jakhanke historians, these traders began in the city of Jakha (on the Bafing River, a tributary of the Senegal) and, following their businesses, expanded into other locations. New Jakhanke towns were founded, under the auspices of local rulers who often permitted self-governance and autonomy. Sixteenth-century Europeans met Jakhanke traders at coastal points as far afield as Gambia and the Gold Coast; hence, they imagined the city called \\"Jaga\\" (Jakha) was a great metropolis controlling trade in all West Africa. Trading groups like the Dyula and Jakhanke did indeed dominate commerce of Upper Guinea, becoming involved not just in moving merchandise, but also in production of goods on plantations worked by their slaves.Wilks, Ivor, \\"The Juula & the Expansion of Islam into the Forest\\", in N. Levtzion and Randall L. Pouwels (eds.), History of Islam in Africa, Athens: Ohio University Press, 2000 Caste and educational system The Jakhanke were the Islamic cleric caste of the Soninke social stratification system. The Soninke social hierarchy organizes individuals into endogamous strata., Quote: \\"The Soninke society in the Gambia is primarily rural and highly gender-stratified culture. (...) In the Soninke social organization everyone occupies a place.\\"Monica Bella (1987), AFRICA STUDIES: THE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE LAND TENURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE BAKEL SMALL IRRIGATED PERIMETERS, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States Agency for International Development, Quote:\\"Soninke society is not egalitarian, but rather is stratified into castes. At the top there is the noble or hore caste. The hore consist of debeaumme, nyinvaaumme, and the marabouts or religious leaders. The power of the marabouts is less than that of other nobles. Next are the artisan castes or nyakhamala. ...\\"; The top level is held by hooro (free men), which included tunkalemmu (princes), leaders designated to exercise authority. They are followed by mangu (princely advisors), a group linked to a kuralemme (warrior) class who acted as defenders and mediators. The third in hooro hierarchy is occupied by modinu (priests, Jakanke), representing Islam's influence on Soninke society. Highly respected for their religious knowledge, modinu are responsible for establishing justice, providing Islamic education and protecting the population with prayers. Below the hooro strata, have been the despised castes of naxamala (dependent men). These included tago (blacksmiths), sakko (carpenters), jaroo (praise-singers), garanko (cobblers) and others. The strata below the horoo (free-men) and naxamala (dependent men) have been the endogamous komo (slaves).Mamadou Lamine Diawara (1990), La Graine de la Parole: dimension sociale et politique des traditions orales du royaume de Jaara (Mali) du XVème au milieu du XIXème siècle, volume 92, Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH, pages 35-37, 41-45 =Jakhanke curriculum= The Jakhanke clerical tradition is respected throughout the Muslim world for producing erudite and distinguished Islamic scholars. Their curriculum vitae are considered an excellent quality, nurturing the young with Muslim values while simultaneously encouraging intellectual pursuits in their natural environment. The standard Majalis program offered for Islamic sciences begins by incorporating a formal introduction into the rules governing recitation (tajweed) and memorization of the Qur'an. Recitation should be done according to rules of pronunciation, intonation, and caesuras established by the Prophet Muhammad, though first recorded in the 8th century. There are seven schools of tajwid, the most popular being the school of Hafs on the authority of ‘asim. This is followed by an in-depth inquiry into the classical studies of Ulum al- hadith (Science of Hadith), Usul al-fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), Nahw arabī or Qawāidu 'l-luġati 'l'Arabiyyah (Standard Arabic Grammar): and language acquisition, which studies the learners processes of acquiring language. The program is concluded following advanced level courses on the science of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir). A total of 28 books must be mastered before a student is eligible to receive the cijaza or sanad (license to teach) from the University. In order to graduate, students are required to completely copy these 28 individual books by hand. If approved by their sheikh, the student is officially awarded permission to begin Islamic instruction at their own Karanta (school).

It is one of the early conversation poems and discusses Coleridge's anticipation of a marriage with Sara Fricker along with the pleasure of conjugal love. However, The Eolian Harp is not a love poem and instead focuses on man's relationship with nature. The central images of the poem is an Aeolian harp, an item that represents both order and wildness in nature. Along with the harp is a series of oppositional ideas that are reconciled with each other. The Eolian Harp also contains a discussion on \\"One Life\\", Coleridge's idea that humanity and nature are united along with his desire to try to find the divine within nature. The poem was well received for both its discussion of nature and its aesthetic qualities. Background Coleridge in 1795 Coleridge began writing The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his engagement to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge was inspired to write the poem after a visit to a house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage.Ashton 1997 p. 74 As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem.Doughty 1981 p. 97 The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections.Mays 2001 p. 231 Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.Yarlott 1967 p. 109 After the poem's original creation, it was expanded from its original use of an Aeolian harp as its theme over the months that followed. However, Coleridge did not stop working on it when it was first published. Instead, the poem was expanded and rewritten throughout Coleridge's life until 1817.Holmes 1989 p. 113 Of the final version, lines 21–25 were previously removed between the 1797 and 1815 editions of Coleridge's poems. Likewise, lines 26–33 were altered through the multiple editions. Regardless of the amount of editing, Coleridge believed that the poem served as a model for other poems, especially those in the series called Conversation poems.Mays 2001 pp. 231–232 Of The Eolian Harp as a model for poetry, Coleridge wrote, \\"Let me be excused, if it should seem to others too mere a trifle to justify my noticing it—but I have some claim to the thanks of no small number of the readers of poetry in having first introduced this species of short blank verse poems—of which Southey, Lamb, Wordsworth, and others have since produced so many exquisite specimens.\\"Mays 2001 qtd. p. 232 Poem The poem begins by addressing Fricker and discussing the house at Clevedon:Ashton 1997 pp. 74–75 As the poem continues, objects are described as if they were women being pursued:Ashton 1997 p. 76 The poem then introduces Coleridge's idea of \\"One Life\\", where man and nature are connected: Near the end of the poem, the narrator discusses pantheism before reproving himself for it soon after: Themes A 19th- century Aeolian harp The poem discusses love, sex, and marriage, but it is not done in the form of a love poem. Instead, it compares love with an Aeolian harp, which is a symbol of poetry. In terms of the relationship described, the desire expressed during an engagement with Fricker is described as innocent. Also, the anticipation of the conjugal union is free of any potential disappointment or any guilt that would result in sex outside of marriage. As such, there is a thematic connection with the poem \\"Lines Written at Shurton Bars\\" written on the same subject around the same time.Ashton 1997 p. 75–76 As the poem was completed after Coleridge's marriage, the themes became similar to the ideas expressed in his Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement. Both poems discuss the Clevedon area and the impact of the countryside upon the viewer. Also, they provide information on how Coleridge and Fricker felt during their relationship and marriage.Holmes 1989 p. 103 However, Reflections suggests that there are some problems within the relationship.Yarlott 1967 p. 97 The poem portrays a series of oppositional ideas and how they can be reconciled with each other. The image of a beanfield is contrasted against the image of a lute while they are compared to the image of a coy woman being caressed and then resisting the caresses. This image is compounded with the coy woman being caressed compared to the innocence of Fricker. Nature is also seen in its oppositions, with a wildness within nature being contrasted with order within nature, especially in regards to the effects of an Aeolian harpRadley 1966 pp. 44–46 and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings about nature.Ashton 1997 p. 107 In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. Coleridge's approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe.Jasper 1985 p. 20 In the same theme, he wrote to John Thelwall in a letter dated 14 October 1797, > I can at times feel strongly the beauties, you describe, in themselves & for > themselves — but more frequently all things appear little — all knowledge, > that can be acquired, child's play — the universe itself—what but an immense > heap of little things? — I can contemplate nothing but parts, & parts are > all little — ! — My mind feels as if it ached to behold & know something > great — something one & indivisible — and it is only in the faith of this > that rocks or waterfalls, mountains or caverns give me the sense of > sublimity or majesty! — But in this faith all things counterfeit > infinity!Jasper 1985 qtd p. 20 The nature images connect back to desire and marriage, especially with an image like the myrtle tree that performs this function in many of Coleridge's poems.Yarlott 1967 p. 79 However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker,Yarlott 1967 p. 118 and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.Radley 1966 p. 46 The poem discusses his understanding of nature within the concept of \\"One Life\\", an idea that is presented as a resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The \\"One Life\\" lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the Aeolian harp. Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions.Jasper 1985 pp. 35–36 Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: \\"Before my visit to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: and I have never seen reason to change my faith in this respect.\\"Jasper 1985 qtd pp. 36–37 Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.Jasper 1985 p. 38 Sources The image of the Aeolian harp was a popular image in turn of the 19th-century literature and collections were built around poems dedicated to the harps. Coleridge's possible poetic influences include James Thomson's Ode on Aeolus's Harp, The Castle of Indolence, and Spring. Arguments have been made for various possible philosophical influences, including: Joseph Priestley, George Berkeley and David Hartley;Prickett, 46–70; Raiger, 76–84 Ralph Cudworth;Martin, 173-176 Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and Moses Mendelssohn;Berkeley, 15–23 and Jakob Böhme.Jasper, 35–36 In Coleridge's copy of Kant's Critik der reinen Vernunft, he wrote: \\"The mind does not resemble an Eolian Harp, nor even a barrel-organ turned by a stream of water, conceive as many tunes mechanized in it as you like—but rather, as far as Objects are concerned, a violin, or other instrument of few strings yet vast compass, played on by a musician of Genius.\\"Mays 2001 qtd. p. 231 Critical response During the mid 20th-century, Virginia Radley states, \\"the 'Eolian Harp' itself can be read with pleasure without a redaction of the poem for meaning. It is a poem which comes full circle from Eden to Eden\\" and that \\"Perhaps a poem should indeed not mean but be, and, to this point, the 'Eolian Harp' is a true poem. The images and the personalities are striking enough to deserve approval from a purely belletristic standpoint. But the poem has meaning also.\\"Radley 1966 pp. 44, 47 Following this, M. H. Abrams declared that the idea of the \\"One Life\\" within The Eolian Harp, \\"best epitomize the Romantic constellation of joy, love, and the shared life\\".Abrams 1973 p. 434 Later, Oswald Doughty argues that the poem is \\"one of his happiest poems\\" and \\"For once Coleridge and his environment blended into a single, harmonious idyllic mood, and the 'blank verse' poem is permeated with a rare fusion of reflective thought and sensitivity to peaceful, nature beauty\\".Doughty 1981 p. 92 Richard Holmes simply describes The Eolian Harp as Coleridge's \\"beautiful Conversation Poem\\".Holmes 1989 p. 95 Rosemary Ashton believes that the poem \\"shows an exact eye for natural detail combined with a sharp ear for rhythms both conversational and yet heightened into poetic form\\".Ashton 1997 p. 75 She later declared that \\"Only a few sonnets and 'The Eolian Harp' [...] display Coleridge's gift for simplicity rising, as if effortlessly, to sublimity.\\"Ashton 1997 p. 97 Notes References * Abrams, M.

To contemporaries the model was generally known as the Daimler 2½-litre until Daimler adopted the North American habit of giving their cars names (although not on any badgework), and an all-steel export version of the car was introduced in October 1948 at the London Motor Show, \\"principally for export\\" and branded as the Daimler Consort. The updates included the integration of the firewall into the body rather than it being part of the chassis, a move from rod operated mechanical brakes to a Girling-Bendix hydraulic front and rod operated rear system, incorporating the head lights into the front guards, and providing a badge plate behind the front bumper with a curved radiator grille replacing the flat one. Specification The car used a 2,522 cc in-line six-cylinder, pushrod ohv engine fed by a single SU carburetter. Throughout its life, was claimed, though a change in the gearing in 1950 was marked by an increase in maximum speed from to for the saloon, while the acceleration time from 0 – improved from 17.9 to 16.9 seconds. By the standards of the time the car was brisker than it looked. The car was supplied with the Daimler Fluid Flywheel coupled to a 4-speed Wilson Pre-selector gearbox. The independent front suspension used coil springs, while the back axle was suspended using a traditional semi-elliptical set-up. The chassis was \\"underslung\\" at the rear with the main chassis members passing below the rear axle. In mid-1950 the restricted ground clearance was improved by the adoption of a conventional hypoid bevel drive to the rear axle replacing the traditional Daimler underslung worm drive which had hampered sales outside Britain.Display advertisement, The Times, Thursday, Jun 15, 1950; pg. 8; Issue 51718 Coachwork Although offered originally as a chassis only model, post-war the most common version was a four-door saloon which Daimler themselves produced. The interior was fitted out with traditional \\"good taste\\" using mat leather and polished wood fillets. By the early 1950s, this coachwork was beginning to look unfashionably upright and \\"severe yet dignified\\". In 1939, Winston Churchill commissioned Carlton Carriage Co to build a drophead coupe on a DB18 chassis, chassis No.49531. He used it during election campaigns in the later 1940s. Production Approximately 1,000 DB18s and 25 DB18 Special Sports were produced to 1940.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars of the 1930s, Haymarket Publishing Ltd, 1989, page 61 In addition 3,355 DB18s, 608 DB18 Sports Specials and 4,250 DB18 Consorts were built in the post-war years.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, Haymarket Publishing Ltd, 1986, page 48 The Consort became a popular car among the wealthy in India. All together, over 100 cars were ordered, mainly by the Maharajas in India and a further dozen were ordered by Royalty in Ceylon and Burma.

For explanations about independent and dependent claims and about the different categories of claims, i.e. product or apparatus claims (claims referring to a physical entity), and process, method or use claims (claims referring to an activity), see Claim (patent), section \\"Basic types and categories\\".  Beauregard  In United States patent law, a Beauregard claim is a claim to a computer program written in the form of a claim to an article of manufacture: a computer-readable medium on which are encoded, typically, instructions for carrying out a process. This type of claim is named after the 1995 decision In re Beauregard. The computer-readable medium that these claims contemplate is typically a floppy disk or CD-ROM, which is why this type of claim is sometimes called a \\"floppy disk\\" claim.See Victor Siber and Marilyn S. Dawkins, Claiming Computer-Related Inventions As Articles of Manufacture, 35 IDEA 13 (1994). The Beauregard case was a test case brought by Victor Siber, IBM's chief patent lawyer at the time, to test the legal theories advanced in his IDEA article. In the past claims to pure instructions were generally considered not patentable because they were viewed as \\"printed matter,\\" that is, like a set of instructions written down on paper. However, in In re Beauregard the Federal Circuit vacated for reconsideration in the PTO the patent-eligibility of a claim to a computer program encoded in a floppy disk, regarded as an article of manufacture.The court remanded to the PTO on the agency's motion for permission to reopen examination in the light of proposed Guidelines on patent-eligibility. The court did not expressly decide whether Beauregard claims are patent-eligible. Consequently, such computer- readable media claims are commonly referred to as Beauregard claims. When first used in the mid-1990s, Beauregard claims held an uncertain status, as long-standing doctrine held that media that contained merely \\"non-functional\\" data (i.e., data that did not interact with the substrate on which it was printed) could not be patented. This was the \\"printed matter\\" doctrine which ruled that no \\"invention\\" that primarily constituted printed words on a page or other information, as such, could be patented. The case from which this claim style derives its name, In re Beauregard (1995), involved a dispute between a patent applicant who claimed an invention in this fashion, and the PTO, which rejected it under this rationale. The appellate court (the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) accepted the applicant's appeal - but chose to remand for reconsideration (rather than affirmatively ruling on it) when the Commissioner of Patents essentially conceded and abandoned the agency's earlier position. Thus, the courts have not expressly ruled on the acceptability of the Beauregard claim style, but its legal status was for a time accepted.Ex parte Bo Li, Appeal 2008-1213, at 9 (BPAI 2008) and MPEP 2105.01, I. However, although time has rendered the issue essentially moot with regard to conventional media, such claims were originally and perhaps still can be more widely applied.Richard H. Stern, An Attempt To Rationalize Floppy Disk Claims , 17 J. Marshall J. Computer & Info. L. 183 (1998). The particular inventions to which Beauregard-style claims were originally directed—i.e., programs encoded on tangible computer-readable media (CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, etc.)—are no longer as important commercially, because software deployment is rapidly shifting from tangible computer-readable media to network-transfer distribution (Internet delivery). Thus, Beauregard-style claims are now less commonly drafted and prosecuted. However, electronic distribution was practiced even during the time when the Beauregard case was decided and patent drafters therefore soon tailored their claimed \\"computer readable medium\\" to encompass more than just floppy disks, ROMs, or other stable storage media, by extending the concept to information encoded on a carrier wave (such as radio) or transmitted over the Internet. Two important developments have occurred since the mid and late 1990s, which have impacted the form or viability of Beauregard claims. First, in In re Nuijten,500 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2007). the Federal Circuit held that signals were not patent eligible, because their ephemeral nature kept them from falling within the statutory categories of 35 U.S.C. § 101, such as articles of manufacture. Practice accordingly evolved to recite Beauregard claim matter as being stored on \\"non-transitory\\" computer-readable media.August 24, 2009 PTO memo, \\"Interim Examination Instructions for Evaluating Subject Matter Eligibility Under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\\" Second, the decisions of the Supreme Court leading up to Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). appeared to exclude what amounted to a patent on information from the patent system. In CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions Inc.,654 F. 3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2011). the Federal Circuit first held a method for detecting credit card fraud patent ineligible and then held a corresponding Beauregard claim similarly patent ineligible because it too simply claimed a “mere manipulation or reorganization of data.”The PTO’s internal appeals board had held, “A computer readable media including program instructions . . . to an otherwise nonstatutory process claim is insufficient to make it statutory.”Ex parte Cornea-Hasegan, 89 U.S.P.Q.2d 1557, 1561 (B.P.A.I. 2009); accord Ex parte Mewherter, 107 U.S.P.Q.2d 1857, 1859 (PTAB 2013). After the Cybersource decision, the Supreme Court’s decision in the Alice case made the status of some Beauregard claims even more uncertain. If the underlying method claim is not patent-eligible, recasting the claim in Beauregard format will not improve its patent eligibility. Claims of this type have been allowed by the European Patent Office (EPO). However, a more general claim form of \\"a computer program for instructing a computer to perform the method of [allowable method claim]\\" is allowed, and no specific medium needs to be specified.Technical Board of Appeal Decision T1173/97 The UK Patent Office (aka IPO) began to allow computer program claims following this revised EPO practice, but then began to refuse them in 2006 after the decision of Aerotel/Macrossan. The UK High Court overruled this practice by decision,2008 EWHC 85 (Pat). so that now they are again allowable in the UK as well, as they have been continuously at the EPO.  Exhausted combination  In United States patent law, an exhausted- combination claim comprises a claim (usually a machine claim) in which a novel device is combined with conventional elements in a conventional manner. An example would be a claim to a conventional disc drive with a novel motor,Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006). to a personal computer (PC) containing a novel microprocessor,Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). or to a conventional grease gun having a new kind of nozzle.Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 303 U.S. 545 (1938).In Lincoln Engineering, the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, claimed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling. The Supreme Court stated that \\"the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination.\\" It then concluded that the inventor’s \\"effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void.\\" A far-fetched example, but one that illustrates the principle, would be a claim to an automobile containing a novel brake pedal. The Federal Circuit held in 1984 that the doctrine of exhausted combination is outdated and no longer reflects the law.Radio Steel & Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984).In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. & Pat. App. 1969). In its 2008 decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents are still in force, at least for purposes of the exhaustion doctrine.The Court held that the sale of a patented microprocessor \\"exhausted\\" not only the microprocessor patent (i.e., removed the legal effectiveness of the patent's statutory monopoly) but also the patent on the personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, because both were based on the same inventive concept. It is therefore unclear what effect, if any, the Quanta decision will have on the validity of exhausted combination claims. Exhausted combination claims can have practical significance in at least two contexts. First is royalties. On the one hand, there is the possibility of the royalty base being inflated (since a car containing a novel brake pedal sells for more than the brake pedal itself would) or creating at least an opportunity to levy royalties at more than one level of distribution (an issue in the Quanta case). On the other hand, the royalties may not be just without a proper combination of elements. A second context is that of statutory subject matter under the machine-or-transformation test. By embedding a claim that does not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test in a combination with other equipment, it may make it possible to at least appear to satisfy that test.Richard H. Stern, Tales From the Algorithm War: Benson to Iwahashi, It's Deja Vu All Over Again, 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991).  Functional  A functional claim expresses a technical feature in functional terms such as \\"means for converting a digital electric signal into an analog electric signal\\". Similar language may be used to describe the steps of a method invention (\\"step for converting... step for storing...\\"). Functional claims are governed by the various statutes and laws of the country or countries in which a patent application is filed. = United States = In the U.S., functional claims, commonly known as \\"means-plus-function\\" or \\"step-plus- function\\" claims, are governed by various federal statutes, including 35 U.S.C. 112, paragraph 6, which reads: \\"An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\\" Extensive analysis has been done on interpretation of the scope and requirements of the means- and step-plus-function claim style. Despite the complexity of this area of law, which includes many ambiguous and logically contradictory opinions and tests, many practitioners and patent applicants still use this claim style in an independent claim if the specification supports such means-plus-function language.  Jepson  In United States patent law, a Jepson claim is a method or product claim where one or more limitations are specifically identified as a point of novelty, distinguishable over at least the contents of the preamble. They may read, for instance, \\"A system for storing information having (...) wherein the improvement comprises:\\". The claim is named after the case Ex parte Jepson, 243 Off. Gaz. Pat. Off. 525 (Ass't Comm'r Pat. 1917). They are similar to the \\"two-part form\\" of claim in European practice prescribed by .http://www.1201tuesday.com/1201_tuesday/2009/06/jepson.html In a crowded art, a Jepson claim can be useful in calling the examiner's attention to a point of novelty of an invention without requiring the applicant to present arguments and possibly amendments to communicate the point of novelty to the Examiner. Such arguments and amendments can be damaging in future litigation, for example as in Festo. On the other hand, the claim style plainly and broadly admits that that subject matter described in the preamble is prior art, thereby facilitating the examiner's (or an accused infringer's) arguments that the improvement is obvious in light of the admitted prior art, as per (a). Prosecutors and applicants are hesitant to admit anything as prior art for this reason, and so this claim style is seldom used in modern practice in the U.S.  Markush  An example of a theoretical Markush structure. Mainly but not exclusively used in chemistry, a Markush claim or structure is a claim with multiple \\"functionally equivalent\\" chemical entities allowed in one or more parts of the compound. According to \\"Patent Law for the Nonlawyer\\" (Burton A. Amernick; 2nd edition, 1991), :\\"In claims that recite... components of compositions, it is sometimes important to claim, as alternatives, a group of constituents that are considered equivalent for the purposes of the invention.... It has been permissible to claim such an artificial group, referred to as a 'Markush Group,' ever since the inventor in the first case... won the right to do so.\\" If a compound being patented includes several Markush groups, the number of possible compounds it covers could be vast. No patent databases generate all possible permutations and index them separately. Patent searchers have the problem, when searching for specific chemicals in patents, of trying to find all patents with Markush structures that would include their chemicals, even though these patents' indexing would not include the suitable specific compounds. Databases enabling such searching of chemical substructures are indispensable. Markush claims were named after Eugene Markush, the first inventor to use them successfully in a U.S. patent (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 1,506,316, 1,982,681, 1,986,276, and 2,014,143), in the 1920s to 1940s. See Ex parte Markush.Ex parte Markush, 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126, 128 (1924). According to the USPTO, the proper format for a Markush-type claim is : \\"selected from the group consisting of A, B and C.\\" MPEP Section 803.02 In August 2007, the USPTO unsuccessfully proposed a number of changes to the use of Markush-type claims.Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Examination of Patent Applications That Include Claims Containing Alternative Language  Omnibus  A so-called omnibus claim is a claim including a reference to the description or the drawings without stating explicitly any technical features of the product or process claimed. For instance, an omnibus claim may read as \\"The invention substantially as herein described\\", \\"Apparatus as described in the description\\" or \\"An x as shown in Figure y\\". = European Patent Organisation = Omnibus claims are allowed under the European Patent Convention (EPC), but only \\"when they are absolutely necessary\\".T 0150/82 (Claim Categories) of 7.2.1984, O.J. EPO issue: 1984,309.: \\"References to the description or drawings\\" = United Kingdom = Although the United Kingdom had formerly allowed omnibus claims, in April 2017 the UK changed its rules so as to disallow omnibus claims in most cases, falling in line with the EPC. However, granted UK patents with omnibus claims remained valid. = United States = Under U.S. patent law, omnibus claims are categorically disallowed in utility patents, and examiners are advised to reject them MPEP 2173.05(r) as failing to \\"particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention\\" as required by 35 USC 112 paragraph 2. By contrast, design patents and plant patents are required to have one claim, and in omnibus form (\\"the ornamental design as shown in Figure 1.\\")  Product-by-process  A product- by-process claim is a claim directed to a product where the product is defined by its process of preparation, especially in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. They may read for instance \\"Product obtained by the process of claim X,\\" \\"Product made by the steps of . . .,\\" and the like. According to the European practice, they should be interpreted as meaning \\"Product obtainable by the process of claim...\\". They are only allowable if the product is patentable as such, and if the product cannot be defined in a sufficient manner on its own, i.e. with reference to its composition, structure or other testable parameters, and thus without any reference to the process. The protection conferred by product-by-process claims should not be confused with the protection conferred to products by pure process claims, when the products are directly obtained by the claimed process of manufacture. In the U.S., the Patent and Trademark Office practice is to allow product-by-process claims even for products that can be sufficiently described with structure elements.See 3 Chisum on Patents § 8.05[2][a]-[c] However, since the Federal Circuit's 2009 decision in Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc., 566 F.3d 1282, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2009), such claims are disadvantageous compared to \\"true product\\" claims. To prove infringement of a product-by-process claim under Abbott, a patentee must show that a product meets both the product and the process elements of a product-by-process claim. To invalidate a product-by-process claim, however, an accused infringer need only show that the product elements, not the process elements, were present in the prior art. This can be compared to a \\"true product\\" claim, where all limitations must be proven to invalidate the claim. Programmed computer A programmed computer claim is one in the form—a general-purpose digital computer programmed to carry out (such and such steps, where the steps are those of a method, such as a method to calculate an alarm limit or a method to convert BCD numbers to pure binary numbers). The purpose of the claim is to try to avoid case-law holding certain types of method to be patent-ineligible. The theory of such claims is based on \\"the legal doctrine that a new program makes an old general purpose digital computer into a new and different machine.\\"In re Johnston, 502 F.2d 765, 773 (CCPA 1974), from the dissenting opinion. The argument against the validity of such claims is that putting a new piano roll into an old player piano does not convert the latter into a new machine. See Piano roll blues.  Reach-through  A reach-through claim is one that attempts to cover the basic research of an invention or discovery.Patently-O web site It is an \\"attempt to capture the value of a discovery before it may be a full invention.\\" Specifically, a reach-through claim is one in which \\"claims for products or uses for products when experimental data is provided for screening methods or tools for the identification of such products.\\" Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F3d 916, 69 USPQ2d 1886, 1896 (Fed Cir 2004); see also Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 68 USPQ2d 1424, 1433 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) A reach through claim can be thought of as an exception to the general rule about claims.National academies web site Power Point required. An example of a denied claim was when the United States Federal Circuit refused to recognize a reach-through claim for Celebrex.  Signal  A signal claim is a claim for an electromagnetic signal that can, for example, embody information that can be used to accomplish a desired result or serve some other useful objective. One claim of this style might read: \\"An electromagnetic signal carrying computer-readable instructions for performing a novel method... \\" In the United States, transitory signal claims are no longer statutory subject matter under In re Nuijten.In re Nuijten. 500 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) A petition for rehearing en banc by the full Federal Circuit was denied in February 2008,Dennis Crouch, Signal Claims Are Not Patentable: Nuijten Stands -- Rehearing Denied, Patently-O, February 11, 2008. and a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied the following October.Nuijten v. Dudas, no. 07-1404, (docket). Retrieved May 17, 2012. In contrast to the situation in the U.S., European Patent Office's Board of Appeal 3.4.01 held in its decision T 533/09 that the European Patent Convention did not as such exclude the patentability of signals, so that signals could be claimed. The Board acknowledged that a signal was neither a product nor a process, but could fall under the definition of « physical entity » in the sense of Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 2/88.  Swiss-type  In Europe, a Swiss-type claim or \\"Swiss type of use claim\\" is a formerly used claim format intended to cover the first, second or subsequent medical use (or indication of efficacy) of a known substance or composition. Consider a chemical compound which is known generally, and the compound is known to have a medical use (e.g. in treating headaches). If it is later found to have a second medical use (such as combating hair loss), the discoverer of this property will want to protect that new use by obtaining a patent for it. However, the compound itself is known and thus could not be patented; it would lack novelty under (before the entry into force of the EPC 2000 and new ). Nor could the general concept of a medical formulation including this compound. This is known from the first medical use, and thus also lacks novelty under EPC Article 54. Only the particular method of treatment is new. However methods for treatment of the human body are not patentable under European patent law (). The Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office solved this by allowing claims to protect the \\"Use of substance X in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of condition Y\\".G 0005/83 (Second medical indication) of 5.12.1984, Opinion of the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal This fulfilled the letter of the law (it claimed the manufacture, not the medical treatment), and satisfied the EPO and applicants, in particular the pharmaceutical industry. Meanwhile, in view of new , on 19 February 2010, the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal issued its decision G 2/08 and decided at that occasion that applicants may no longer claim second medical use inventions in the Swiss format.\\"Patents Act 1977: Second medical use claims\\" , UK IPO, Practice notices.

It states general agreement with the Swedish Piratpartiet.. as a party of the information society; it is part of the international movement of pirate parties and a member of the Pirate Parties International. In 2011-12, the party succeeded in attaining a high enough vote share to enter four state parliaments (Berlin, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein) and the European Parliament. However, their popularity rapidly declined and by 2017 they had no representation in any of the German state parliaments. Their one European MEP, Patrick Breyer, has joined the Greens/EFA group. Together with Marcel Kolaja, Markéta Gregorová and Mikuláš Peksa from the Czech Pirate Party they build up the European Pirate Party team for the European Parliament in Brussels. According to political theorist Oskar Niedermayer, the party sees itself as part of an international movement to shape with their term of \\"digital revolution\\" which is a circumscription for the transition into information society. With their focus on freedom in the net and their fight against government regulations of this sphere, they caught the attention especially of the younger generation. Even if the network policy is the core identity of the party, it is now more than just an advocacy party of \\"digital natives\\" and characterises itself as a social-liberal-progressive.. Former federal chairman Sebastian Nerz sees the party as social-liberal party of fundamental rights which among other things wants to advocate for political transparency..

The party favors the civil right to information privacy and reforms of copyright, education, genetic patents and drug policy. In particular, it promotes an enhanced transparency of government by implementing open source governance and providing for APIs to allow for electronic inspection and monitoring of government operations by the citizen. The Pirate Party also supports an unconditional basic income for citizens and direct democracy via e-democracy. Inaugural meeting in 2006, at the c-base in Berlin (presentation of the board candidates)  History  History of membership The party was founded on 10 September 2006. Thorsten Wirth has been the Party Leader since 30 November 2013. Previous leaders were , Sebastian Nerz, Dirk Hillbrecht, Christof Leng, and Jens Seipenbusch. In February 2009, the village spokesperson of Hohenstein and as such city councillor in Strausberg Jens Knoblich joined the Pirate Party Germany. In June 2009, Bundestag member Jörg Tauss left the SPD and joined the Pirate Party after the Zugangserschwerungsgesetz was passed, but left the Pirate Party in 2010 when he was convicted for possession of child pornography. In late August 2009, Herbert Rusche, one of the founding members of the German Green Party and, in the 1980s, the first openly homosexual member of parliament in Germany, joined the Pirate Party.. During the 2011 Berlin state election, the party entered a state parliament for the first time when the Berlin party chapter received 8.9 percent of the votes for the state parliament of Berlin. , the party had around 35,000 members.  Election results  = 2009 federal election = On 27 September 2009, the Pirates received 2.0% (845,904 votes) in the 2009 German federal election, thus not securing any seats in the Bundestag. However, this was still the best result among parties that did not meet the 5% threshold. Among first-time male voters, the party received 13%. On account of the election results in 2009, the party fulfils the conditions for receiving public allowances. For 2009, it received €31,504.68 (the same amount as it received from private contributions) which was exclusively due to the Pirates state associations Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. The calculation was made based on the total receipts of the party in 2008. The possible upper limit of the public allowance matching for the party is a rate of €840,554.51.Gesamtübersicht Festsetzung der staatlichen Teilfinanzierung für das Jahr 2009 gemäß §§ 18 ff. PartG (in German), dated: 21 January 2010. = 2009 European Parliament election = Election results in the 2009 European Parliament election It received 229,117 votes in the 2009 European Parliament election, which was 0.9%, but not enough (at least 5%) for a seat.Acht Gründe für die Piratenpartei Wirtschaftswoche; 13 June 2006. in German = State and regional elections = On 30 August 2009, the Pirates received 1.9% in the 2009 Saxony state election. On the same day, the party also received one seat in each council in the local elections of Münster and Aachen, although candidates of the party ran for office only in some constituencies of both cities.Piraten ziehen in Stadträte ein (German), gulli.com, 30 August 2009 Support for The Pirates differs somewhat between States. The party received 1.8% in the 2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election and 1.5% in the 2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election (though without securing seats), but only 0.5% in the 2009 Hesse state election and did not participate in the 2009 Brandenburg and Saarland state elections. The party received 2.1% in the 2011 Hamburg state elections, though it was not yet enough to gain seats in the State parliament. In the 2011 Baden-Württemberg state election the Pirate Party was able to repeat this result. In the 2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election they received 1.4% or 13,828 votes; in the 2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election they achieved 1.6% of the votes. Results for the Pirate Party in the 2011 Berlin state election. Left: results for direct mandates. Top right: results by borough. In the 2011 Berlin state election, with 8.9% of the votes the Pirate Party of Berlin managed for the first time to overcome the 5% threshold and to win seats (numbering 15 out of 141 seats in the Abgeordnetenhaus) in a German state parliament. This was quite a surprise for them, since they only had 15 candidates on the ballot. In response to their election, however, Mayor Klaus Wowereit criticized their lack of diversity, most notably the lack of women in the party. In March 2012, the Pirates received 7.4% of the vote and thus won 4 seats in the Landtag of Saarland. Subsequent 2012 polls have shown an increase in popularity in the Party. In May 2012, they won 8.2% of the vote in Schleswig-Holstein, which was sufficient to enter the state parliament, gaining 6 seats. Also in May 2012, they won 7.8% of the vote in North Rhine- Westphalia, gaining 20 seats. =2013 federal election= After those successful state elections, the party was able to score up to 13% in nationwide polls. However, after a string of scandalshttp://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-voters-grow- disillusioned-with-pirate- party-a-863234.htmlhttps://newrepublic.com/article/137305/rise-fall-pirate- party and internal disputes which were handled unprofessionally and picked up by the media, the party lost the trust of voters and entered a steady decline in polls. As a result, in the Lower Saxony state election in January 2013, the Pirate Party was only able to gain about 2.1% of the votes, missing the 5% threshold needed to gain actual seats in the state parliament. Six months later during the Bavaria state election of 2013 the Pirates fared similarly, receiving again only 2% of the votes. At the 2013 German federal elections the following weekend, the party suffered another major defeat where it was again only able to achieve 2.2% of the votes, leading to the resignation of party leader . = 2014 European Parliament election = A Pirate Party Germany election placard in Berlin in 2014, stating \\"Release the hemp!\\" (\\"Gebt das Hanf frei!\\") In the 2014 European parliament elections, the Pirate Party received 1.45% of the national vote (424,510 votes in total) and returned a single Member of the European Parliament. The elected MEP, Julia Reda, joined the Greens–European Free Alliance as an independent. = 2016 Berlin state election = The Berlin state election on September witnessed the collapse of support for the Pirate Party in their previous stronghold of Berlin. Their previous vote of 8.9% achieved in 2011 fell to 1.7% and the Pirate Party lost all representation in the Berlin State assembly. The poor result was compounded by the murder suicide of former Pirate Party assembly member Gerwald Claus-Brunner.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/gerwald- claus-brunner-german-pirate-party-politician-confessed-before-suicide = 2017 dropout from state parliaments = Together with the satirical party Die PARTEI the Pirate Party nominated Engelbert Sonneborn as candidate for the German presidential election in February 2017. The Pirate Party continued to decline in 2017, dropping out from state parliaments. In the Saarland state election in March 2017, the Pirate Party received only 0.7% of the voter share and therefore lost all its seats in the Landtag of the Saarland. With the North Rhine-Westphalia state election in which it lost every seat, the Pirate Party is no longer represented in any state parliament. = 2019 European Parliament election = In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Pirate Party retained their MEP seat, with their lead candidate Patrick Breyer being elected.

Fisher that seeks to influence United States foreign policy by \\"Promoting Peace Through Strength\\". ASCF's current president is Dr. Henry A. Fischer. The ASCF was formed in 1958, and was originally known as the Institute for American Strategy. For over 50 years the Foundation has been focused on a wide range of educational programs which address critical challenges to U.S. foreign policy, national security, economic security and moral leadership of the United States of America. The ASCF headquarters is at 1250 24th Street NW, Suite 300. On June 4, 1997, the American Security Council, a separate organization initiated in September 1954 by Robert E. Wood, retired chairman of Sears Roebuck and Company, was merged into the American Security Council Foundation.  History  The ASCF has received credit for developing programs and strategies that have been adopted as the foreign policy and national security strategy of the United States. This mission was mentioned in the Guidelines for Cold War Victory, a 1963 publication of the ASCF, and was additionally praised by former President Dwight Eisenhower in his radio address to the nation that was recorded at the ASCF's request. In 1978, the ASCF created the National Strategy for Peace Through Strength and the Peace Through Strength Coalition. President Ronald Reagan credited the ASCF numerous times for providing the overall theme for the administration of his presidency. Former President Reagan acknowledged the ASCF on multiple occasions and claimed America won the Cold War by adhering to this doctrine. President Reagan remarked that, \\"One thing is certain. If we're to continue to advance world peace and human freedom, America must remain strong. If we have learned anything these last eight years, it's that peace through strength works\\". Paul Laxalt, Chairman of the Reagan for President Campaign and Senate Co-Chairman of the CPTS, wrote to John Fisher that, \\"The Coalition's resolution calling for a national strategy for Peace through Strength became the defense strategy plank of the Republican Party Platform\\". President Reagan said, \\"I am particularly pleased that you also plan to involve members of congress, key administration officials and a wide range of private institutions in the further development of a national strategy of Peace Through Strength. This will be essential as a guide on how to spread democracy throughout the world. My administration will cooperate fully with you in this project\\". While George H. W. Bush was vice president, President Reagan and John Fisher jointly presented Vice President Bush with the Gold Presidents Eagle Pin in recognition of strong support of the Peace Through Strength strategy. The ASCF worked to have the United States government publish an official National Security Strategy. This was first implemented by President Reagan in 1985. All of his successors are legally required to produce a similar document that analyzes the security priorities and concerns of the nation.  Board Members  * Henry A.

It features rotating exhibits, which change yearly. History Asa R. Slocumb built Vermont House in the 1790s shortly after moving to Shelburne, Vermont. His descendants continued to live there until 1929 when they abandoned the house. According to legend, Slocumb's first home was a log cabin which probably resembled the Museum's Settlers House. Over time he constructed the wood frame and clapboard exterior that would become Vermont House's original façade around and over the log cabin. After completing the new exterior, he dismantled the cabin and carried the logs away. Relocation When the Shelburne Museum acquired Vermont House in 1950, the building's clapboard siding and interior walls had deteriorated beyond repair. While preserving its basic structure, the Museum built a new façade with stone from a Shelburne Falls gristmill, randomly laying the stones using a technique known as scatter-stone, and reconstructed the interior with salvaged feather-edged boards from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut houses. Although the museum preserved the structure's four original fireplaces, it changed the floor plan so that it would include a study and a larger kitchen.

Davis (1884-ca. 1962) was an American architect who designed homes and public buildings in Honolulu, Hawaii.Sakamoto et al. (2008), p. 38 During the 1920s, he was involved in laying out the new King Street campus of President William McKinley High School and designing its buildings in a Spanish Colonial Revival style.Sakamoto et al. (2008), p. 47 He employed a similar style (Mission Revival) in designing the 1931 Honolulu Police Station on Merchant Street, which harmonized well with that of the new city hall, Honolulu Hale. Both the old McKinley campus quadrangle and the Merchant Street Historic District are on the National Register of Historic Places. Architectural styles Davis was well known for his work in the Spanish Colonial/Mission Revival style, but he also designed a very significant building that is one of the few enduring examples of rustic Mediterranean Revival architecture in the state: the Territorial Board of Agriculture and Forestry Building (1930) at the corner of Keeaumoku and King Streets in Honolulu. For this building, he employed locally quarried sandstone with distinctive green mortar, along with concrete masonry and finer sandstone for such detailing as window sills, lintels, colonnades and casements, topped by a tiled, low-pitched hip roof without eaves.Cheever and Cheever (2003), p. 91 During the early 1930s, land developer Theo H. Davies & Co. hired Davis to design new homes in a \\"Monterey\\" (or Spanish eclectic) style to be built on lots being developed in the new subdivision of Kāhala.Sakamoto et al.

Ossipoff did not disappoint.\\" He referred to this style as \\"Modified Monterey\\" using Hawaiian influences.Hawaiian Modern: The Architecture of Vladimir Ossipoff, page 42 Davis is also credited as the architect of several of Hawaii's classic movie theatres. The Princess Theatre opened in 1922 at 1236 Fort Street. It was remodeled in 1939, renovated in 1958 for Cinerama, closed in 1969, then demolished. The New Pawaa Theatre opened in 1929 at 1550 South King Street. Its exterior and distinctive Spanish-style interior was renovated in 1962, when it was renamed the Cinerama, then closed in 1999 to become an auto-parts store. The New Palama Theatre opened in 1930 at 701 North King Street with 1,100 seats. This ornate Chinese-style building was leased and renamed the Zamboanga Theatre in 1970, but became retail space and is now a church. The rural Waipahu Theatre, with its graceful sloping tile roof, opened in late 1930 on Depot Road, across from the Waipahu Sugar Mill. Sold in 1970, it is now a church. In 1931, Davis designed the Lihue Theatre on the Island of Kauai.

Therefore, the Spiru Haret University is increasingly considered in Romania and outside it as a diploma mill. Its lawyers seek to circumvent Romanian education laws, and this implied the consequence that new laws are discussed by the Romanian Department of Education, Research and Innovation, which may lead to the prohibition of all Spiru Haret's activities.

During these three years, Spiru Haret University has been placed under the scrutiny of the Romanian Department of Education.Government Ordinance no. 10/2009 Monitorul Oficial, Part I, no. 581 of August 20, 2009. According to Government Decision no. 749/2009,Monitorul Oficial , no. 465, year 177 (XXI) of Monday July 6, 2009, p. 86 (Monitorul Oficial is the state newspaper wherein laws and government decisions have to be officially published in order to become effective.) Civil Law Sentence no. 3326 has radiated the Spiru Haret University, at its own request, from the application of Government Decision no. 676/2007 regarding the license university study fields, the structures of higher education institutions and the disciplines organized by them, with the subsequent additions and from Government Decision no. 635/2008 regarding the structures of higher education and the specialization/curricula for university license studies organized by them, either accredited or temporarily authorized to operate, republished.Cf. Punct de vedere July 20, 2009. Aracis.ro. (ARACIS is the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, mandated by law to evaluate universities.) The students enlisted at accredited/authorized faculties from the Spiru Haret University may still proceed with their study, but will have to take (final) diploma exams at recognized universities (faculties) which are not prohibited to hold diploma exams. The Romanian Department of Education has won the case against the claims of the Spiru Haret University in respect to Government Decisions no. 676/2007 and no. 635/2008, as the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided on October 30, 2009.Decizie definitiva pentru Ministerul Educatiei in procesul cu \\"Spiru Haret\\" 30 October 2009.Dosar 4329/1/2009 Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice. As such, the self-removal the university from the application of such decisions is null and void, therefore its authorized/accredited curricula remain authorized/accredited, but all other claims of broader accreditation made in the name operating according to its constitutional right to academic autonomy have been dropped, since this right may only be exercised as provided by law.Cf. the viewpoint of Mrs. Andronescu, then Minister of Education, discussing the issue debated in courts at Vezi ce a spus Ecaterina Andronescu la videochat despre Univ.

UNIVERSITATEA «SPIRU HARET» DIN BUCUREŞTI. On November 10, 2009, at the Bucharest Appeal Court was registered at its office of the clerk the certificate in the Dossier no. 7174/2/2009, suspending the application of the Government Decisions no. 749/2009 and no. 943/2009 at the request of the Spiru Haret University, until judgment was pronounced in this case.Certificat de grefă November 10, 2009.Dosar 7174/2/2009 , Curtea de Apel București. The university called for being paid damages by the Romanian government and personally by the clerks who wrote the Government Decision no. 749/2009. In this trial, the significant difference in respect to the previous High Court trial is that the government did not list the Spiru Haret University in the Government Decision no. 749/2009, considering that this university does not want to be listed therein (according to the verdict of the Bucharest Court of Appeal which was canceled after the publication of the Government Decisions no. 749/2009), and listed it again in Government Decision no. 943/2009, when reconsidering Government Decision no. 749/2009, as demanded by the university, which has won a trial in this respect.Dosar 6631/2/2009 Bucharest Court of Appeal.Dosar 6631/2/2009 Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice. Such government decisions are the official lists of all accredited/authorized Romanian curricula in a certain year. No other curriculum than those listed therein may issue a license diploma, and no other curriculum counts as higher education study (legally). The Bucharest Court of Appeal reached a verdict on June 29, 2010 about the Government Decisions no. 749/2009 and no. 943/2009. The verdict of the Bucharest Court of Appeal rejects the action of the university because of having no ground and admits the request for intervention made by the Department of Education. Even if the Department of Education could not have predicted the verdict, the Romanian High Court of Justice and Cassation had registered the recourse made by the Romanian Department of Education in respect to the decision of the Bucharest Court of Appeal in the same dossier while its trial was still pending. Although the Department of Education has not fully lost the case judged by Bucharest Court of Appeal, it made recourse to the High Court and the university had there an opportunity to ask for the cancellation of the verdict of the Bucharest Court of Appeal by the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The Department of Education has won this trial, Decision no. 5565/14.12.2010 the High Court rejecting the request for suspending the execution of the administrative decision which the university has tried to cancel.Fișă dosar 7174/2/2009 Înalta Curte de Casație și Justiție a României.

On May 17, 2011, the Bucharest Court of Appeal rejected the action of the university as inadmissible; a recourse is possible. On June 17, 2010, the Minister Daniel Petru Funeriu signed the Department of Education Order no. 4235/2010, published in Monitorul Oficial no. 421 of June 23, 2010.Ordinul MECTS nr. 4.235/2010 - aprobarea Metodologiei privind monitorizarea speciala a Universitatii \\"Spiru Haret\\" din Bucuresti Avocatnet.ro. This order concerns the approval of the methodology for the special monitoring of the “Spiru Haret” University, monitoring which applies three years after the Government Ordinance no. 10/2009 became effective. The order stipulates that Spiru Haret's exams commissions for graduations have among their members professors/teachers from other universities, which are the representatives of the Romanian Department of Education in this respect. The commissions consist of at least one representative of the Department, the representatives of the Department being 50% of the total number of the members of each exams commission. “The candidacy dossiers of 63 graduates of the \\"Spiru Haret\\" University were rejected by the Scholar Inspectorate Prahova” writes Raul Florea in the newspaper Gândul.Raul Florea 63 de absolvenţi ai “Spiru Haret”, întorşi din drum la titularizare Gândul, July 11, 2010.

A new scandal has arisen since the university has renamed its distance learning as “technological centers for accessing the examination platform e-learning”, in order to hide the fact that it cannot offer authorized/accredited distance learning.Andreea Ofițeru Cum au ascuns cei de la Spiru Haret că învâțământul ID nu este acreditat Adevărul, July 12, 2010. The university has announced that the 2008 and 2009 graduates of its unauthorized and unaccredited curricula will have to repeat the diploma exam in September 2010, at the same university.Comunicat Spiru Haret August 4, 2010.Adriana Ailincei Absolvenții \\"Spiru Haret\\" trebuie să dea încă o dată licența, spun reprezentații instituției Realitatea.net, August 4, 2010.G.

Mr. Gabriel Ispas has declared on behalf of the Department of Education that this does not imply that their diplomas will be lawfully recognized. According to the minister, an exams session was approved in September in order that the students may have their license exams in accordance with Government Ordinance no. 10/2009 and to the norms for special supervision of the “Spiru Haret” University.Funeriu: Spiru Haret va putea organiza examen de licență la toamnă sub monitorizarea ministerului Realitatea.net, August 6, 2010. But there is no legal proviso which would allow the graduates to take their license exams again, Government Ordinance no. 10/2009 making reference only to the students of this university, thus it makes no reference to its licensed graduates. According to the Address of the Department of Education no. 13265 August 6, 2010,Adresa MECTS nr. 13265 of August 6, 2010. Law no. 84/1995Art. 60 alin (5) and Art. 67 alin. (3) and (4) of Law no. 84/1995. makes a clear distinction between “graduate” and “graduate with a diploma”, the address of the department being applicable only of “graduates”. Through this address the conditions for lawfully organizing an exams session for “graduates” are made known to the university. This exams session was postponed sine die, since the \\"Spiru Haret\\" University did not agree with the conditions stipulated by the Department of Education for holding these exams.Ileana Popescu Licența din septembrie de la Spiru Haret a fost suspendată Realitatea.net, September 9, 2010.

It is to be noticed that the High Court did not recognize the validity of her diploma, but only the fact that her diploma has not been canceled by a court of law, and until such thing would happen, Mrs./Ms. Din enjoys the presumption of the legality of her diploma. The annulment of her diploma is possible, but it would require another trial. According to the newspaper Adevărul, several groups of graduates from the Spiru Haret University have organized themselves in order to sue the Department of Education.Simona Soare Absolvenți ai „Spiru Haret“ dau în judecată Ministerul Educației Adevărul, October 26, 2010. The personal advisor of the education minister, Mr. Tudorel Urian, said \\"We wish them good luck, but this is a problem of those who allowed such exam to take place, it is a problem of the university\\". Art. 120 the Education Law which will has become applicable in 2011 provides that offering diplomas for higher education curricula which are neither accredited nor temporarily authorized (by ARACIS) constitutes the felony of material falsification of official documents, punished according to the penal law.LEGEA EDUCAȚIEI NAȚIONALE transmisă Parlamentului României în vederea angajării răspunderii.

Funeriu recognized that it applies to several universities and that his department does not have the right to cancel diplomas. In December 2011 the minister has declared that his department prepares an order in order to solve the matter of the graduates of unaccredited and unauthorized studies, but it has to wait for advice from the NRC.Raul Florea Ministerul Educației pregătește un ordin pentru absolvenții Universității „Spiru Haret”.

He was internationally recognized as an expert diagnostician with regard to tumors of the musculoskeletal system—especially the bones, but was also an experienced and skilled general surgical pathologist. Early life and education Dahlin was born in September 1917 to David and Rose Dahlin in Beresford, South Dakota. They were farmers who had little cash income; therefore, young David Jr.-- and his three brothers and sisters—learned frugality and the virtues of hard work from an early age.Woolner LB: Surgical pathology at the Mayo Clinic. In: Rosai J (Ed.): Guiding the Surgeon's Hand. Washington, D.C.: American Registry of Pathology, 1997, pp. 166-168. As a teen, an entire summer of plowing sixty- five acres with a horse-drawn plow led him to conclude that another vocation was a wise choice. Accordingly, despite the fact that the Dahlin family had virtually no money, David enrolled in the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. He worked his way through school, graduating magna cum laude with a B.Sc. degree in 1938. Medical education Dahlin was accepted to Rush Medical College in Chicago, Illinois. He again worked nights throughout his time as a medical student, usually for less than 40 cents per hour. Despite this arduous schedule and the demands of school, David graduated with an M.D. in the spring of 1940. He then served as a rotating intern at Ancker General Hospital (formerly City & County Hospital) in St. Paul, Minnesota, and continued as a first-year resident in general pathology at that institution. The United States entered World War II during his Ancker pathology training experience, and Dahlin enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) in 1942. Military service  Once commissioned as an officer in the USAAC Medical Corps, Dahlin was accepted into the training program for flight surgeons. He spent his first service year in the training command in Texas and North Carolina, and was then posted to Bari, Italy, as a medical officer in the 15th Air Force. He supported the 5th Photo Reconnaissance Group, comprising P-38 fighter planes equipped with high-resolution photographic equipment. After two years overseas, Dahlin was discharged from the Army in the fall of 1945 with the rank of Major (O4), having been awarded the Bronze Star.Veterans History Project-- David C. Dahlin, http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.12663 [Accessed 6-1-2009] Dahlin also held the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. He retained a keen interest in the history of the European Theater of Operations in World War II throughout the rest of his life. File:Bronze Star medal.jpgBronze Star Medal File:EAMECM.jpgEuropean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal File:WWIIVictory.gifWorld War II Victory Medal Residency and early career Dahlin returned to Rochester in November 1945, intending to begin residency training in general surgery. However, because of scheduling issues, he was assigned first to the surgical pathology laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital, under the tutelage of Dr. Malcolm Dockerty. Dockerty was a dynamic and gifted pathologist, whose teaching captured Dahlin's interest and loyalty. Hence, he switched his training emphasis to anatomic and clinical pathology, completing residency in 1948 and publishing his master's degree thesis (at the University of Minnesota) on systemic amyloidosis.Dahlin DC: Primary amyloidosis, with report of six cases. Am J Pathol 1949; 25: 105-123. He was then appointed to the staff of the Mayo Clinic as a consultant in pathology. Rapidly, Dahlin became a skilled general surgical pathologist in the mold of Dockerty, but began to develop special expertise in neoplasms of the skeletal system. No one had previously studied such lesions systematically at the Mayo Clinic; indeed worldwide knowledge on that topic was then quite limited. Working with Mark Coventry, an orthopedic oncologist, Dahlin cataloged the clinical, radiographic, macroscopic, and histopathologic features of virtually all bone tumors in the Mayo archive. That undertaking eventuated in the publication of a book entitled \\"Bone Tumors: General Aspects and an Analysis of 2276 Cases,\\" in 1957.Dahlin DC: Bone Tumors: General Aspects and an Analysis of 2276 Cases, C.C. Thomas, Springfield, IL, 1957. That text has subsequently gone through 5 additional editions and is still in print under the editorship of Krishnan K. Unni and Carrie Inwards.Unni KK, Inwards CY (Eds): Dahlin's Bone Tumors: General Aspects and Data on 10,165 Cases, Lippincott-Williams & Wilkins, 2009. Later career and honors The publication of his book and other writings on bone tumors—eventually numbering over 200 original articles—prompted many invitations for lectureships throughout the world. Dahlin’s opinion was sought internationally on a huge number of challenging bone tumor cases, not only for advice on pathologic interpretation but clinical management as well. He served as section-head of surgical pathology at Mayo for many years, and was a Professor in the Mayo Medical School. Dahlin received a host of professional honors, including the first gold medal of the International Skeletal Society, the Distinguished Pathologist Award of the United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology, the Fred Stewart Award from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Mayo Clinic, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Dahlin also was the first physician inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame.Unni KK: David C. Dahlin [obituary]. Skeletal Radiol 2004; 33: 117-118. He retired from active practice in 1983, but continued to serve as an informal consultant for some years thereafter. Personal life Dahlin married Helen DePass in October 1941. She died of gallbladder carcinoma in March 1990 at the age of 69.http://search.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&db;=MNDeaths&gsfn;=%2cHELEN&gsln;=%2cDAHLIN&gspl;=1%2cAny+Locality&submit;=Search%2cSearch&prox;=1%2c1&gss;=angs-d&o;_iid=33216&o;_lid=33216&pcat;=34&fh;=5&h;=516034&recoff;=1+2, Accessed 10-4-2009. The couple had three children together—Brian, Eric (1948-2005), and Martha. Dahlin was an avid sportsman, enjoying hunting, fishing, canoeing, camping, and handball. Death In July 2003, Dahlin was interviewed for the U.S. Veterans History Project. Two months later, he contracted viral encephalitis while on a camping trip at the age of 86 and died of that illness on September 12, 2003. He is buried next to his wife and son in Rochester, Minnesota.Ibid.

Ultimate licensure is the responsibility of individual states. There are roughly 190,000 practicing dentists in the United States. Dental education In order to be accepted to an American dental school, most candidates must possess at least a bachelor's degree as well as the pre-requisite courses. The first 2 years of dental school consist mostly of didactic education as well as simulation courses. The last two years generally involve direct patient care under supervision. There tends to be much overlap in most schools' curricula; the didactic years may have some clinical components, while the last two years still have significant didactic coursework. During dental school, students must take and successfully pass Part I and Part II of the National Board Dental Examination (also known as \\"the Boards\\"), which are administered by the ADA. Part I is usually taken after the second year of dental school, while Part II is usually taken sometime in the fourth year. The cost of attending dental school is high; most newly graduated dentists have borrowed US$200,000 or more in student loans and other debts to pay for their education. Licensure = Accredited programs = The first step in practicing dentistry in the United States is graduating from an accredited dental degree program in the United States and Canada. The graduates of Australian dental schools cannot be licensed in the United States. The reciprocity agreement between CDAC (Canada) and Australia does not extend to the United States and the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The reciprocity agreement that CODA has with CDAC only covers Canadian programs. CODA does have policies and procedures in place for accrediting established international predoctoral education programs. = Regional boards = Most states require candidates to pass a regional board exam. Regional boards are agencies which are contracted to test graduating dental students on clinical skills for a specific region of the country. These exams usually have several components, both written and clinical, and the latter is performed on live patients. The different boards include the Northeast Regional Board of Dental Examiners (usually referred to as the \\"NERB\\"), Western Regional Examining Board (usually referred to as the \\"WREB\\"), Central Regional Dental Testing Service (CRDTS) and the Southern Regional Testing Agency (SRTA). California, Connecticut and Minnesota are states which allow candidates to complete a 1-year General Practice Residency (GPR) or an Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) in lieu of a regional board exam. As of 2007, New York no longer accepted the NERB and has since required all graduates to complete a GPR or AEGD. Specialty training Dental graduates have the option of pursuing specialty training.

Today funding for dentistry includes self-payment, private insurance, employer-sponsored insurance, Medicaid and SCHIP.  Criticisms  Evidence since 1977 has shown that seeing a dentist every six months, as is standard in the United States, is not associated with improved dental or oral health.

As of February 2018, it has more than 370 corporate and franchise-owned restaurants in 37 states and 9 countries. Founded in 2007 by restaurant industry veterans Rick Schaden and Tom Ryan, the chain serves \\"smashed\\" burgers using a specialized process of cooking them on a flattop grill at a high heat. This technique originated in the Great Lakes Region at pressed-chuck burger restaurants, and has been a staple there for decades. The method sears the burger for flavor. These are then topped with a number of different kinds of ingredients and can be customized. Additionally, the chain at one time offered unique burgers in each city where its restaurants are located. The menu also includes chicken, turkey and portobello sandwiches as well as french fries, sweet potato fries, fried pickles and other items. Some locations offer Udi’s Healthy Foods gluten-free bun. The restaurant saw rapid growth after its first location opened in 2007 and it added several hundred locations within a few years, though a larger slowdown of the \\"better burger\\" industry saw it slow its size and expansion plans. Company leaders initially considered an IPO, but Philippine-based quick-service operator Jollibee Foods Corporation bought a 40 percent stake in the company in 2015, at which time it was valued at $335 million. As of December 2018, Jollibee acquired 100% of Smashburger. History Tom Ryan, co-founder of Smashburger, in the kitchen of a Cincinnati restaurant in 2013 =Creation= Smashburger was founded in 2007 by two fast food industry veterans. Tom Ryan had previously helped to develop the stuffed crust pizza concept for Pizza Hut and later served as chief concept officer for McDonald's, and Rich Schaden was a former owner of Quiznos. The two launched the venture with private equity firm Consumer Capital Partners. The restaurant was envisioned to highlight a higher market for hamburgers, as a part of a wave of \\"better burger\\" restaurants including Shake Shack, which uses similar techniques. It adopted the name Smashburger, Ryan later said, because the name \\"had this really great hand-crafted connotation, which we do. It also kind of had this organic, earthy, commonly popular approach, and it had a little edginess to it, for younger, generational people.\\" Ryan has a Ph.D. in Flavor & Fragrance Technology and Lipid Toxicology from Michigan State University. With $15 million in capital, the two bought a Denver restaurant, Icon Burger, to experiment with cooking and management techniques for a higher-end burger restaurant. The founders then spent six months developing an efficient and fast \\"kitchen engine\\", designing the restaurant's kitchen to have modular surfaces, and with a central griddle that houses a refrigerated area underneath where meatballs are stored. This allows the burger cook to be properly supplied without having to walk away from the griddle. The kitchen concept was later adapted and standardized for every Smashburger location. The restaurant's signature \\"smashing\\" technique is achieved with a special cutter and technique, which also allows it to train new cooks quickly and open new locations without having to redesign the back-end process. They used flattop grills for the kitchen and rejected char broilers or barbecue grills, and the founders did a blind taste test of 300 kinds of beef including varieties of Wagyu and Kobe for the burgers before settling on chopped Angus beef. The founders systematically narrowed down the options until they came to just four, and found that all were Angus beef provided by different distributors. =Growth= Inside the kitchen of a Smashburger restaurant With David Prokupek as CEO and Ryan focusing on developing the menu, the restaurant was designed with quick scalability in mind. The first Smashburger restaurant opened in Denver in June 2007, and the chain then expanded to Houston, and then to Minneapolis, areas where Ryan and other founding management were familiar with the local real estate market. Marketing for the restaurants focused on the customizability of the menu, freshness of ingredients, and features to give each restaurant a local feel. The chain's first marketing revolved around the tagline \\"Smash, sizzle, savor.\\" In 2011, as the business was growing at a steady clip, it shifted its theme to \\"Smashed Fresh. Served Delicious.\\" The restaurant identified 14 distinct customer archetypes to pursue based on income levels, geography, education and lifestyle. While it initially relied heavily on social media to build its brand, the company started television and radio advertising in 2013 with Denver-based Definite Productions as a marketing manager. It later hired one of the executives from that company as chief marketing officer. The restaurant chain grew to 143 locations, half franchises, and $54 million in annual revenue by the end of 2011. That year, it was reported to have as many as 450 franchise agreements in the books. That year it announced plans to open new locations around airport in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain through franchises. It had grown to 170 locations around the world by 2013, and $228 million in revenue. In 2014 it grew to 256 locations and $300 million in revenue. It had grown to 312 stores with 7,000 employees in early 2015. In mid-2016 this had grown to 365 locations. That year, the company announced a franchise agreement with Pearl Investments LLC to open 26 new locations in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. By mid-2017, this had grown to 380 locations in 38 U.S. states and nine countries, of which 220 were company owned and the rest were franchises. The success of Smashburger and other specialty burger restaurants is credited with taking market share from major fast food brands like McDonald's, even with Smashburger's burgers sold at higher prices. Where McDonald's was considered the market leader for casual dining, it saw a sales drop of 2.4 percent and a 15 percent drop in net income in 2014, the first decline in those figures in 33 years. Changed consumer tastes, in particular Smashburger's popularity, was credited, because of a customer perception that Smashburger's food was of higher quality and more customizable. Still, Smashburger commands a relatively small portion of the larger U.S. market for burgers. The restaurant had an estimated 0.2 percent U.S. market share in 2014, compared to 1.4 percent for Five Guys and a combined 71 percent for McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King. =Acquisition by Jollibee= Growing quickly, Smashburger was by 2013 considered an attractive prospect for an IPO. That year, it secured a $35 million debt facility from Golub Capital. This capital, in addition to the revenue generated by business operations, was thought to support two or three years worth of expansion by the chain. Its CEO said, though, that converting to a public company was a possibility for the company over the long-term. In 2015, Smashburger CEO Scott Crane again suggested the company could prepare for its own IPO at some point, saying it had until that point grown 20 to 25 percent and that it was adding 60 to 80 restaurants a year. In October 2015, the Philippine-based quick-service operator Jollibee Foods Corporation announced that it had acquired a 40 percent stake in Smashburger for $100 million, in a deal that gave the chain an enterprise value of $335 million. Its CEO said the decision to sell would mean more stable long-term growth as opposed to relying on the stock market, which could be unpredictable. Following this, Smashburger began additional advertising, renegotiated leases for some of its restaurants and launched a subscription-based rewards program platform called Smash Pass in order to increase customer traffic. The chain also introduced Apple Pay, as well as offering specials like a pass that allows customers to buy a $1 burger a day for 54 days in a bid to build loyalty. It also introduced new menu items including a turkey burger, tater tots and a \\"triple double\\", though the latter prompted a copyright infringement lawsuit from In-n-Out Burger. The restaurant faced difficulties in continuing to grow, in part as shoppers began to shift away from shopping in traditional retail centers where its restaurants were concentrated. At the same time, larger restaurant chains increased their efforts to grow sales and brought on higher-quality menu items to compete with Smashburger and restaurants like it. Subsequently, Smashburger saw its overall same-store sales decline as a number of other local \\"better burger\\" concepts grew. Crane left as CEO in April 2016, and was replaced by Mike Nolan, but he resigned nine months later and Ryan took over the role. The restaurant thus condensed its expansion strategy to focus on existing markets and began mentorship programs to develop leadership talent from within its ranks of workers. It also bought back some franchise restaurants in several major markets. Smashburger competitors like Shake Shack and Five Guys experienced many of these difficulties, as well. In 2016, Smashburger was estimated to have $338.3 million in sales. On 13 February 2018, Jollibee increased its ownership stake to 85 percent of Smashburger in another $100 million deal. In making the acquisition, the companies said the move would allow Smashburger to further expand its presence in southeast Asia. Restaurants A Smashburger restaurant in Cincinnati, Ohio Smashburger uses market research to determine where to open new restaurants, and the restaurant has favored opening new locations next to many major college campuses in the United States, sometimes opening shops directly on campus which are run by concessionaire companies like Compass Group and Aramark. It has also sought to open locations in casinos, in particular signing agreements in casinos in Las Vegas and in Oklahoma. It has also opened locations in high-traffic airports as well, partnering with HMSHost. A typical Smashburger location sees $3,000 to $5,000 in revenue during a mealtime rush, but its highest-volume restaurants can see $3 million to $5 million a year in sales. Ryan integrated ambiance, decor and music as a part of a larger customer experience. Restaurants are designed with specific decor, a prominently bright red color scheme, and customer flow. But, the restaurant does not have a model footprint and so each location can be tailored to the available space. Restaurant interiors are designed in a modern style with indirect lighting and decorated with locally-produced photo murals. Customers order at a central counter and food is brought to them in stainless steel baskets. They are given silverware to eat with in place of plasticware. Restaurants are designed with a social feel in mind, and feature high tables and low tables, booths, and an outdoor patio. The company has a tailored music soundtrack for restaurants as well. An internal team designed and built the initial soundtracks around the restaurant's \\"Smash, sizzle, savor\\" theme. As Smashburger began to grow, management brought in outside consultants in 2011 to develop a new program for music that would better fit a \\"modern, high- energy\\" restaurant concept, though it retains a family-friendly vibe. Music in restaurants was subsequently designed with a target audience of 32 years old, avoiding overly bubblegum or electronic music and rooted in contemporary pop, allowing its sound track to remain mainstream but allowing for older classics as well as new and emerging international music. International locations feature an American-inspired soundtrack as well. The company also has employee incentives for stores it owns directly which it credits with boosting morale, including paying $9 an hour in 2011, above the then-minimum wage of $7.25. Bonuses are awarded for certain milestones as well. Cooks are awarded extra money for filling orders in under six minutes, while managers are given bonuses for meeting monthly revenue goals and gaining positive customer reviews. =Awards= The restaurant chain was named \\"America's Most Promising Company\\" in 2011 by Forbes. In 2014, it again made this list coming in at number 6 for \\"America's Most Promising Companies.\\" In 2017 the chain was named the number 9 favorite burger restaurant brand in America by The Harris Poll’s annual EquiTrend Study. Crane was named one of \\"10 Executives to Watch\\" by Nation's Restaurant News during his tenure at the company. Menu A Smashburger with standard toppings Smashburger’s menu focuses primarily on burgers, chicken sandwiches, black bean burgers and salads, with a variety of toppings and options that can be customized to a customer's taste. The company also offers a number of sides, including french fries, sweet potato fries, fried onions, and fried pickles, and \\"smash fries\\" which are topped with rosemary and olive oil. Many of the sandwiches are topped with an in-house \\"smash sauce\\" made with mayonnaise, mustard, pickles and lemon juice. Smashburger's main dessert item is a milkshake made with Häagen-Dazs ice cream. About 20 milkshakes are sold per 100 burgers. The chain experimented with a breakfast menu for a time but it found this to be unprofitable, accounting for just 10 percent of its revenue but 30 percent of expenses. Some of its specialized locations such as those in casinos do continue to offer breakfast menus. Smashburger also attempted a system for customers to fill out menu cards as they waited in line which was not successful. =Burger technique= The restaurant's burgers are created using chopped Angus beef chuck steak cut into thin slices. Fast food restaurants more typically use ground beef to form burger patties. It also markets its meat as \\"fresh, never frozen\\" and the beef is transported in portions from distribution sites to restaurants each morning. There, employees divide the beef into loosely-packed meatballs by hand. The burger meatball contains a bouillon-like flavoring and it is also seasoned with a proprietary blend that includes kosher salt, black pepper, and garlic, shortly before cooking. Meanwhile, the burger buns are made using a compression toaster and butter wheel so that they do not become too soggy once a patty is placed on them. An employee \\"smashes\\" a burger in the kitchen of a Smashburger restaurant Burgers are produced in a made-to- order format, with Smashburger's signature \\"smashing\\" technique achieved by placing the meatball on a griddle heated to and pressing it hard using a special tool for 10 seconds to flatten. Burgers typically are not further pressed after they have begun to cook, as once the patty is heated to the point that fat begins to melt, pressing the burger will squeeze the juices out and cause it to dry out. The technique caramelizes the bottom of the patty onto the buttered griddle and locks the juices into the burger, preventing them from escaping and marinating the burger in its own juices. Smashburger's \\"smashing\\" technique also lets it cook burgers in three minutes, where a traditional burger can take up to eight minutes to cook. During mealtime rushes, this also means customers cycle through the tables in the restaurant more quickly and each table can turn three successive groups of guests per hour instead of two. A BBQ bacon cheddar burger with deep fried onions on top, another core menu item In order to avoid the stigma of a restaurant chain, Smashburger crafts local burgers for each city where it is located and markets them extensively. These burgers are designed after consulting with distributors for the kinds of ingredients that are most shipped to a particular city or geographic area. For instance, Smashburger's Colorado locations serve burgers with roasted green chiles, while locations in Miami serve burgers with grilled chorizo. In Minneapolis, the chain has a double- cheese, double-onion variety evoking Scandinavian and Germanic cuisine. Its Oklahoma variety features locally-popular fried pickles, while Boston locations serve a burger with onions and a cranberry chutney supplied locally by Ocean Spray. The burgers tend to be original creations as opposed to duplicating local flavors; in the case of Minneapolis the chain deliberately avoided selling a burger that would resemble the locally-renowned Jucy Lucy. There are exceptions, such as in Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids restaurants, where the local burger is topped with olives, a tradition that had once been locally popular. The restaurant attracted criticism from health experts for the unhealthiness of some of its menu offerings. A large “BBQ Bacon and Cheddar\\" Smashburger has 1,050 calories, while a \\"Chocolate Oreo Shake\\" has 950 calories. Initially, the restaurant made only larger burgers and marketed large servings as a value add, but as it grew it began to offer different sizes to appeal to a larger audience. In order to appeal to people who are health-conscious and people who want more inexpensive meals, the chain now offers burgers in , and varieties. =Local beer and ingredient pairings= An Oreo milkshake at Smashburger, which is made with Häagen-Dazs ice cream Smashburger sources its ingredients from producers local to its stores, where possible. Chicago-based locations serve burgers made with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce, while Tennessee burgers use Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce, Florida locations use barbecue sauce containing orange juice, New Orleans locations have a barbecue sauce containing Barq's syrup and Utah locations serve honey barbecue. Telera rolls are used as buns in California restaurants, pretzel buns are served in Chicago restaurants, onion rolls in Minnesota restaurants and brioche in New York restaurants. In 2012, the company launched a program to partner with regional craft beer breweries to serve local beers to pair with its burgers and sandwiches. It promoted the new program with tasting events featuring bloggers and local media. In this program, each burger on Smashburger's menu is paired with a specific beer from the brewer, which is then sold in restaurant locations in that area. The partnerships caused a 30 to 50 percent increase in beer sales in stores, Ryan later said. About 15 to 20 percent of all orders now include a beer order. Among the breweries Smashburger partners with (as of 2016) are Deep Ellum Brewing Co. in Dallas, Summit Brewing Co. in Minneapolis, Sixpoint Brewery in New York, and Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. in Cincinnati.

After dropping from law studies, he began his career as a host on local radio in the Paris region in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he found a certain notoriety by presenting programs on Fun Radio, Europe 1 and Europe 2 (Arthur et les pirates, PlanetArthur and Radio Arthur). He became, from 1991, host of television programs, first on France 2 and TF1 (Les Enfants de la télé, La Fureur). Meanwhile, he started a theater career with two one-man shows, Arthur en vrai (2005) and I Show (2009) and portraying Peter Brochan in Le Dîner de Cons (2007), alongside Dany Boon. Since the mid-1990s, he has also been an entrepreneur in the audiovisual field. He was, until 2006, vice president of the French subsidiary of production company Endemol. Since 2008, he has been the owner of Ouï FM. Early years Jacques Essebag was born on 10 March 1966 in Casablanca. His father, Michel Essebag, was a chartered accountant and his mother a housewife. He has a brother Olivier. Like many Sephardi Jews, his parents left Morocco in 1967, during the Six-Day War\\"L'animateur Arthur réagit aux manifestations d'antisémitisme à son égard\\", La Tribune de Genève tdg.ch Retrieved June 9, 2009 and settled in the Paris region, in Massy. After high school, he began studying law at Sceaux, at the Faculty of Law Jean Monnet of the University of Paris-Sud 11. While he repeated his first year, he made his debut radio broadcast, on the local radio station Massy-Pal, on which he hosted the show Tonus which provided sports scores for the city.Arthur, Les Echos Lesechos.fr Retrieved June 9, 2009 Radio career In 1987, he became a presenter on RFM. He took the pseudonym of Arthur to distinguish from a homonym. In 1988, he spent a short time on Kiss Fm, then joined Skyrock in 1989.\\"Itinéraire d'un enfant bosseur\\", La Presse de Tunisie, p.5 Lapresse.tn Retrieved June 9, 2009 With Skyman, he created Les zigotos du matin. =1990s= In 1991, he joined Fun Radio to host programs from 6:30 am–9:00 am, in which he created games such as the provocative Orgasmotron (simulation of a live female orgasm). His notoriety grew when, thanks to a publicity campaign for his program in which he presented himself as \\"the greatest cunt of the FM band\\". On Fun, he met Emmanuel Lévy, aka Maître Lévy, who became his director and accompanied him in his TV career. He left Fun Radio the following season in 1992 to join Europe 1, which wanted to rejuvenate its audience. There he hosted for four seasons Arthur et les pirates, between 4.30 pm-6.00 pm, with Maître Levy, Alexandre Devois (Captain Sboob), Princess Jade (met on Skyrock), Rémy Caccia and Michèle Bernier. He hosted the same games as he did on Fun. During the first season, the show took place among the audience. In September 1996, he returned on Europe 2 to host La Matinale from 8 am to 9:30 am, then from 7:30 am to 9 am from 1997. The show was recorded a series of sketches with false listeners. The humoristic team was composed of Maître Levy, Gad Elmaleh, Axelle Laffont, Tex, Gus (Gustave de Kervern of Groland), François Meunier (JC of Skyrock) and Philippe Lelièvre. =2000s= At the beginning of 2000, Arthur left Europe 2 and hosted PlanetArthur on Fun Radio, every afternoon from 4.00 pm to 6.30 pm, alongside Maître Levy, Myriam, Valérie Benaïm and Cyril Hanouna. When Sébastien Cauet arrived on Fun Radio in September 2004, Arthur wanted to leave the radio and contacted his lawyers. He alleged, in effect, that Cauet had previously made a joke about Nazi concentration camps\\"Arthur, Cauet et Auschwitz\\", L'Express Lexpress.fr Retrieved June 9, 2009 in 1995 and therefore refused to work on the same radio. Fun Radio did not accept to let him go, arguing that the contract ended on 30 June 2005 and forced him to continue to host PlanèteArthur, in September 2004. Arthur then made three programs entitled Libérez Arthur, in which he explicitly asked to be released from his contract, particularly in disseminating support messages from his friends from show business and did some parodies of the station Director, played by Jonathan Lambert. On 9 September, Fun Radio stopped the broadcast.\\"Fun Radio prive Arthur d'antenne\\", Le Nouvel Observateur Nouvelobs.com Retrieved June 9, 2009 In November 2004, a court broke the contract with Fun Radio for the benefit of the radio, but not allow damages.\\"Arthur perd en justice face à Cauet\\", Le Nouvel Observateur Nouvelobs.com Retrieved June 9, 2009 In October 2007, Arthur and Cauet finally reconciled : Cauet attended a performance of Le Diner de Cons,\\"Arthur et Cauet sur la voie de la réconciliation\\", Ozap Ozap.com Retrieved June 9, 2009 then Arthur participated in La Méthode Cauet, on 20 December 2007, then Cauet was invited to the evening of Christmas Eve, on 31 December 2007, hosted by Arthur. A few months later, he moved to Europe 2 on which he hosted Arthur et les Pirates between 4.00 pm and 6.00 pm, with Maître Levy, Princesse Jade and Jonathan Lambert. His first show was the world record of running of a radio show (33 consecutive hours, from 25 November 2004, 4:00 pm, to 26 November, 1:00 am). This record was later beaten by Cauet on Fun Radio. This program, entitled 33 heures chrono, was produced as DVD and adapted in a series of programs on MCM. From September 2005 to February 2006, he hosted a new program, Radio Arthur, with Manu Levy, Jaz and Jonathan Lambert. TV career In 1992, he began a TV career with L'Émission impossible on TF1. The program, aired on Friday night at midnight, was stylistically a mix of talk show and provocative sketches in the style of Howard Stern.The show was a failure but introduced to the general public comedians such as Élie Semoun, Dieudonné M'bala M'bala, Laurent Violet and Alexandre Devoise. In 1994, he presented on France 2 Les Enfants de la télé, alongside Pierre Tchernia. On France 2, he also hosted in 1996, La Fureur du samedi soir, a karaoke program co-presented by Pascal Sevran. Later he exported these programs on TF1 at the same time as Les Enfants de la télé. He also co-hosted the Victoires de la Musique with Michel Drucker. Arthur then launched other entertainments on TF1, like Rêve d'un soir and 120 minutes de bonheur. The show CIA, co-hosted and co-produced in 2001 by Dominique Farrugia, was a failure. The program consisted of a series of humorous journalistic investigations. Arthur also produced other successful programs such as Exclusif on TF1 or La Grosse Émission on Comédie !, through his company named Case Productions, which he was co-owner with producer Stéphane Courbit, and which was later renamed ASP. In 2001, Arthur became vice president of Endemol France, created after the acquisition of ASP by Endemol. The company launched many TV reality shows in France. Endemol France bought many other production companies and Arthur sold his shares in Endemol in late 2006. Arthur continued to host Les Enfants de la Télé and other successful programs including TF1's À prendre ou à laisser, a local version of Deal or No Deal. He presented the 2007 NRJ Music Awards on 20 January 2007. His show was sponsored by NRJ Radio. In August 2007, he decided to leave À prendre ou à laisser to devote himself to his new theater career in Le Dîner de Cons. Les Enfants de la télé and the Christmas Eve remain at present his only TV shows. On 5 January 2009, he hosted again À prendre ou à laisser for a quarter year. Since 8 November 2010, Arthur hosts Ce Soir Avec Arthur on the Comedie! channel, a weekly mix of news and humor. At his side, comedians Claudia Tagbo, Ary Abittan and Amelle Chahbi do separate segments. Critics and fans have noted how some segments, such as the opening credits and lip-synched musical numbers, are strikingly similar to those on the U.S. show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on CBS, including the use of completely identical puppets. Craig Ferguson spoke of his astonishment on his 22 November 2010 show,\\"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\\" Retrieved November 23, 2010 equating the plagiarizing of his show to \\"taking pants from a hobo\\". Worldwide Pants Inc., who own the intellectual property of The Late Late Show, have not commented officially, but sources familiar with the matter said that legal action was being contemplated. However, Arthur made an appearance on Ferguson's program on 29 November, arguing that the similarities are an homage rather than a copy, and indicating that no animosity exists between the two hosts; the program ended with the two imitating the final scene of Casablanca and suggesting a new friendship. In June 2011, Craig went to France with Kristen Bell and his robot sidekick, Geoff Peterson, during which he appeared on Arthur's show. Theater career In September 2005, Arthur began a theater career with a first one-man show by Isabelle Nanty entitled Arthur en vrai, in which he wanted to \\"present himself to the public\\" and to change his image.\\"Arthur dans « iShow », mercredi à Lille : « Le kif suprême d'avoir le public en face »\\", La Voix du Nord Lavoixdunord.fr Retrieved June 9, 2009 During the first tour, this show was played in Europe, North Africa and Quebec\\"En terrain vierge\\", Voir Voir.ca Retrieved June 9, 2009 and was seen by over 100,000 people in France.\\"Arthur, spectacle - iShow\\", France 3 France3.fr Retrieved June 9, 2009 In 2007, Arthur spent a casting to portray Pierre Brochan in Le Dîner de Cons, alongside Dany Boon.\\"Bientôt au théâtre dans la pièce de Francis Veber\\", TV Mag Tvmag.com Retrieved June 9, 2009 Francis Veber, the director, choose him and gave him the role of Pierre Brochan previously played by Claude Brasseur / Michel Roux on stage and Thierry Lhermitte in the film adaptation.

Drake was a wooden steam barge that towed consorts loaded with coal and iron ore on the Great Lakes. She came to the rescue of the crews of at least 4 foundering vessels in her 19 year career only to meet the same fate in her final rescue attempt. Drake sank in 1901 off Vermilion Point after a rescue attempt of her consort Michigan. Her rudder, anchor, and windlass were illegally removed from her wreck site in the 1980s. They are now the property of the State of Michigan. The rudder is on display as a loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and the anchor and windlass are on loan for display to Whitefish Township Community Center. The wreck of Drake is protected as part of an underwater museum in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. Career Drake was constructed in 1882 in Buffalo, New York as a wooden steam barge and named for the line superintendent of her building company, Mr. Marcus Motier Drake. The Drake started her career in September 1882 by towing the barge F.W. Gifford. In 1883 she was chartered for Lake Erie to Duluth, Minnesota for coal and from Marquette, Michigan to Lake Erie for iron ore. In 1885 she was re-admeasured and had upper decks added at the Union Dry Dock Company in Buffalo, New York. James Corrigan of Wickliffe, Ohio became her third and final owner in 1889. During her nine-year career, she came to the rescue of distressed vessels and she had several mishaps of her own, including stranding on a reef in 1882, running ashore in 1888 near Cheboygan, Michigan, and striking a bar and sinking at the dock in Duluth, Minnesota in 1889. In 1883, Drake rescued the crew of her consort, the 347-ton schooner Dot (the former Mary Merrit), when Dot began leaking and sank off Grand Marais, Michigan. In 1889, Drake picked up 3 passengers and the 15-man crew from the wooden steam barge Smith Moore that had been sideswiped by James Pickands in heavy fog. Drake towed Moore for 6 hours when Moore finally sank only 300 feet from the bar at the mouth of the Munising, Michigan harbor. In 1900, Drake rescued the 8-man crew from the leaking schooner-barge R. Hallaran that foundered off Keweenaw Point near Stannard Rock Light. Drake saved at least 4 crews from foundering vessels during her career but her final rescue of her own consort's crew caused a fatal blow to her structure that resulted in her suffering the same fate. Final voyage On 1 October 1901, Drake headed into a storm on Lake Superior with her consort, the 27-year-old, 3-masted schooner barge Michigan, both heavy with iron ore loaded at Superior, Wisconsin. As Drake labored through frigid rain and wind, by 2 October 1901, the seams of Michigan's planking began to leak at a rate that overwhelmed her pumps. The flooded and dense iron ore cargo made it likely that Michigan would sink without warning before the dawn of the day. Captain John McArthur Jr., of Michigan, ordered the thick towing hawser pulled in within hailing distance of Drake to communicate their status by shouts amplified with a megaphone. It was decided that Michigans crew would be removed in the pitch black night as there was no chance of launching Michigans yawl in the prevailing winds. Michigan was drawn up to Drake so that her bow was up against Drakes stern quarter on the leeward side. With the two wooden hulls grinding against each other, the crew of Michigan leaped to Drake when the waves brought the two decks level to one another. Just as the last of the Michigans crew were safely transferred to Drake, the wind carried Michigan into a sea trough causing her jib boom that jutted forward from her forepeak to rake across length of Drake. Drakes after cabin was fractured and her tall smoke stack was lopped off and shoved overboard. Drake was mortally wounded. The loss of her smoke stack prevented a proper draft to her boilers to form a full head of steam to her engines and part of that steam was diverted to the pumps needed to stay ahead of the flooding below decks caused by the fractured after cabin. Without full steam, Drakes Captain J. W. Nicholson, could not keep her from hanging up in the sea trough in gale force winds even though he ordered the crew to break up her cabins to feed a wood fire that burned hotter than a coal fire. When Northern Wave, a 2 year old steel package freighter, headed upbound out of Whitefish Bay shortly after 6:00 that morning, she spotted the struggling Drake flying a distress signal from one her masts and the crew frantically swarming the cabins with fire axes and bare hands. When Captain M.S. Peterson eased Northern Wave to the windward side of the foundering Drake, three crew members leaped to the deck of Northern Wave. Heavy seas prevented the steel Northern Wave from staying alongside for a rescue of Drakes crew without risking her wooden hull. Northern Wave attempted to tow the water-logged Drake but the hawser immediately snapped. Captain Peterson informed Captain Nicholson by megaphone that he would standby in case Drakes crew could be taken off but both knew the near impossibility of launching the lifeboats in the gale. By late afternoon Drake had slowed to a crawl due to her inability to keep up steam. Northern Wave still hovering nearby. The situation appeared hopeless until the steel freighter, Crescent City, came upon the struggling Drake. Crescent City was nearly twice the size of Drake and she used her massive hull to provide an artificial lee from the gale force wind. Michigans cook, Harry Brown, leaped toward Crescent City before the two vessels were close enough and was swallowed by Lake Superior. The rest of the crew waited until the hulls of the two ships were grinding together and all of them safely jumped to Crescent City by 17:00. Crescent City reached the Soo Locks with Michigan and Drake crews at 2:00 on 3 October 1901. Drake was a $35,000 loss and Michigan was a $19,000 loss. Wreck history Anchor and windlass from M.M. Drake (1882) displayed next to Whitefish Township Community Building Rudder from M.M. Drake (1882) displayed at Whitefish Point The schooner-barge Michigan was never seen again after the night of 2 October 1901. The wreck of Drake was first discovered by Captain Campbell of Liberty just 4 days after she sank on 6 October 1901, when he was downbound for the Soo Locks. Captain Campbell reported that Drake was located between Vermilion Point and Whitefish Point lying on her side in of water with about feet of water over her with a floating spar still strung to the hull. The wreck of Drake lay forgotten on the bottom of Lake Superior for 77 years until she was rediscovered at in 1978, by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) who subsequently illegally removed her rudder, windlass, anchor, and a sign board in the 1980s. Michigan’s Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Evening News reported a Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1992 raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and its offices that found evidence of 150 artifacts illegally removed from the state-claimed bottomlands, including artifacts from Drake. Following a settlement agreement with the GLSHS, Drakes rudder, anchor, and windlass are now the property of the State of Michigan. The rudder is on loan to the GLSHS for display nearby the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and the anchor and windlass is on loan to Whitefish Township for display next to its community building. Great Lakes diver Harrington reported that Drakes wreck lies scattered on the lake bottom about from Vermilion Point. Oleszewski reported that decades of winter ice and spring and fall storms smashed the remains of her upright keel leaving only the boiler standing. The Drakes wreck site is protected for future generations of scuba divers by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. Divers who visit the wreck sites are expected to observe preservation laws and \\"take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but bubbles\\". Harrington cautions that \\"divers must be certain of their abilities and equipment\\" when diving the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve.

In compliance with state and federal regulations, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Burgettstown Area School District received a $821,921 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 42 or 2.97% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and School safety The Burgettstown Area School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Burgettstown Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct.

The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.

Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards. =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $1,258,555 in ARRA – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Washington County ARRA FUNDING Report website April 2010 =Race to the Top grant= Burgettstown Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support. Governor's Press Office. January 20, 2010. Pennsylvania was not approved for the federal grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Burgettstown Area School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. It was required to make the report public. =Real estate taxes= The Burgettstown Area School Board set property tax rates in 2011–12 at 117.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010–11 – 117.00 mills. *2009–10 – 114.00 mills. *2008–09 – 110.00 mills *2007–08 – 105.00 mills. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010–2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010–11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Burgettstown Area School District 2006–2007 through 2011–2012. *2006–07 – 5.6%, Base 3.9% *2007–08 – 4.9%, Base 3.4% *2008–09 – 6.3%, Base 4.4% *2009–10 – 5.9%, Base 4.1% *2010–11 – 4.2%, Base 2.9% *2011–12 – 2.0%, Base 1.4% *2012–13 – 2.4%, Base 1.7% For the 2011–12 school year, the Burgettstown Area School Board applied for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index due to escalating pension costs. Each year, the Burgettstown Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Burgettstown Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009–10 or in 2010–11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief for 2,962 approved residents of Burgettstown Area School District was set at $180. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the school district was $184 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2889 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Washington County, 73% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5–1–10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Enrollment and Consolidation= The Pennsylvania Department of Education reports that the enrollment in Burgettstown Area School District will continue to decline through 2020.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Enrollment and Projections for Burgettstown Area School District, July 2010 A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009 Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009).

He was also supporter for the use of the people's language in education instead of archaic forms of Greek. Life Methodios Anthrakites' signature. Anthrakites was born in the village of Kaminia (Καμινιά) or Kamnia (Καμνιά), in the Zagori region (Epirus). He studied in the Gioumeios (later Balaneios) School in Ioannina under Georgios Sougdouris. After becoming a priest, he left for Venice in 1697, where he studied Philosophy and Mathematics (geometry, trigonometry, astronomy and physics).Χρήστου Π. Μεθόδιος Ανθρακίτης. Βίος – Δράσις – Ανέκδοτα έργα, Ioannina 1953. His stay in Venice lasted until 1708, during which period he was priest at the San Giorgio dei Greci. He returned to Greece in 1708 to become the first director of the Ierospoudasterion, a new school founded in Kastoria in Macedonia with a benefaction from Georgios Kastriotis, a wealthy Greek from Kastoria, living in Wallachia. There he focused on teaching contemporary European philosophy and mathematics. In his book “The Way of Mathematics”, later edited and re-printed by his student Balanos Vasilopoulos, Anthrakites referred to the Copernican heliocentric system, although he supported the geocentric system.Pappas V & Karas I. \\"The printed Book of Physics: the Dissemination of Scientific Thought in Greece 1750-1821 before the Greek Revolution\\", Annals of Science 44(1987):237–244 His teachings were regarded as unusual enough at the time to give rise to suspicion in Church circles. Anthrakites resigned from the Ierospoudasterion in 1718 and moved to Siatista, also in Macedonia, where he taught for another two years. He returned to Kastoria and in 1723 appeared before the Bishop of Achris Ioasaph to defend his Christian faith. After that journey he moved back to Ioannina where he became director of the Gioumeios.Χρήστου Π. Μεθόδιος Ανθρακίτης. Βίος – Δράσις – Ανέκδοτα έργα, Ioannina 1953. On 23 August 1723, the Patriarchate of Constantinople formally accused him for heresy as a “Cartesianist” and issued a condemnation of his teachings. Anthrakites was also suspended (“unfrocked”) from the Church. Scholars from Ioannina protested the decision to the bishop of Nikopolis Paisios. Subsequently Anthrakites went to Constantinople, where he publicly burned his manuscripts after defending himself at the Orthodox Synod. He was restored but was forbidden from teaching anything other than accepted theological doctrine.Μπόμπου-Σταμάτη Β., \\"Ο Μεθόδιος Ανθρακίτης και τα ‘Τετράδια’\\", Ελληνικά 45, 1995.
