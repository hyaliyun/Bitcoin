Like all natives of the planet Vyrga, Gates has a largely insectoid body. He is also noted for his strong political views, tending towards socialism. Fictional character biography Gates was the third non-biped member (after Quislet and Tellus) in the history of the Legion (the first after the 1994 Reboot). He was also unique amongst Legionnaires in being their only unwilling member, having been drafted by his planetary government to represent them in the Legion (which he perceived as being militaristic and inherently fascist). Apparently Gates is one of the very few free-thinkers on his homeworld; the rest are unindividualistic conformists. Gates has played key roles in many missions; his tactics enabled Star Boy to defeat Validus of the Fatal Five and he was able to resist the Emerald Eye's possession. Gates was part of the Legion team that was stranded in the 20th century for a time, where he came up with the strategy to defeat Mantis, and forged a close friendship with teammate Brainiac 5. Gates also joined Ultra Boy in helping out at soup kitchens during their stay. Like many of the Legionnaires that were original to the Post-Zero Hour continuity, Gates did not appear in the \\"Threeboot\\" continuity. Gates reappeared with his Legion in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2. In the later issues he shows disdain towards the Legion of New Earth for having few non-humanoid members. In #4, he is tasked with bringing the three versions of Brainiac 5 to the Fortress of Solitude, along with Light Lass. In #5, following the villains' defeat, Gates decided to remain with the pre-Crisis Legion. New 52 In The New 52 timeline, Gates made his first appearance in Legion Lost, where he and several other Legion of Super-Heroes members had become trapped in the 21st Century. He was thought killed in the time bubble/transporter accident that stranded the Legionnaires in the past,Legion Lost Vol.2 #1 but in fact survived, though physically damaged.Legion Lost Vol.2 #4 He and his teammates would reunited with their 31st Century comrades and, in another time travel adventure, encounter the present day Justice League United and together battle the cosmic threat Infinitus.Justice League United #6-10, Annual #1 Powers and abilities Gates has the ability to create glowing green, circular teleportation \\"gates\\", which people and objects can travel freely through to emerge from a partner gate at a location he himself defines mentally (it is also possible to make the trip in reverse, travelling from the partner gate to the original gate). Gates' \\"gates\\" have been shown to have sharp edges; he accidentally severed Ra's al Ghul's arm once while teleporting.

The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development. Aldolase A is found in the developing embryo and is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle. Aldolase A expression is repressed in adult liver, kidney and intestine and similar to aldolase C levels in brain and other nervous tissue. Aldolase A deficiency has been associated with myopathy and hemolytic anemia. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011] Structure ALDOA is a homotetramer and one of the three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded by three different genes. The ALDOA gene contains 8 exons and the 5' UTR IB. Key amino acids responsible for its catalytic function have been identified. The residue Tyr363 functions as the acid‚Äìbase catalyst for protonating C3 of the substrate, while Lys146 is proposed to stabilize the negative charge of the resulting conjugate base of Tyr363 and the strained configuration of the C-terminal. Residue Glu187 participates in multiple functions, including FBP aldolase catalysis, acid‚Äìbase catalysis during substrate binding, dehydration, and substrate cleavage. Though ALDOA localizes to the nucleus, it lacks any known nuclear localization signals (NLS). Mechanism In mammalian aldolase, the key catalytic amino acid residues involved in the reaction are lysine and tyrosine. The tyrosine acts as an efficient hydrogen acceptor while the lysine covalently binds and stabilizes the intermediates. Many bacteria use two magnesium ions in place of the lysine. {The reaction mechanism of aldolase. The enzyme's reactive site amino acid's side-chains are shown in blue. Abbreviations: DHAP - dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru1,6bP - Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; GAD - glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; } The numbering of the carbon atoms indicates the fate of the carbons according to their position in fructose 6-phosphate. Function ALDOA is a key enzyme in the fourth step of glycolysis, as well as in the reverse pathway gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldol cleavage of the C3‚ÄìC4 bond. As a result, it is a crucial player in ATP biosynthesis. ALDOA also contributes to other \\"moonlighting\\" functions such as muscle maintenance, regulation of cell shape and motility, striated muscle contraction, actin cytoskeleton organization, and regulation of cell proliferation. ALDOA likely regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling through interacting with cytohesin-2 (ARNO) and Arf6. ALDOA is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, though it is predominantly expressed in developing embryo and adult muscle. In lymphocytes, ALDOA is the predominant aldolase isoform. Within the cell, ALDOA typically localizes to the cytoplasm, but it can localize to the nucleus during DNA synthesis of the cell cycle S phase. This nuclear localization is regulated by the protein kinases AKT and p38. It is suggested that the nucleus serves as a reservoir for ALDOA in low glucose conditions. ALDOA has also been found in mitochondria. ALDOA is regulated by the energy metabolism substrates glucose, lactate, and glutamine. In human mast cells (MCs), ALDOA has been observed to undergo post-translational regulation by protein tyrosine nitration, which may alter its relative affinity for FBP and/or IP3. This change then affects IP3 and PLC signaling cascades in IgE-dependent responses. Clinical significance Aldolase A (ALDOA) is a highly expressed in multiple cancers, including lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), renal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is proposed that ALDOA overexpression enhances glycolysis in these tumor cells, promoting their growth. In LSCC, its upregulation correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis, while its downregulation reduces tumor cell motility and tumorigenesis. Thus, ALDOA could be a potential LSCC biomarker and therapeutic drug target. Aldolase A deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that is linked to hemolysis and accompanied by weakness, muscle pain, and myopathy.

She participated in the 1801 Battle of Copenhagen, the Battle of Trafalgar, and the Siege of Santo Domingo. In 1813 she became a powder hulk and was broken up in 1827. Early career Polyphemus was laid down at Sheerness in 1776. On 26 April 1778, His Majesty King George III visited Sheerness to inspect the dockyards. There he saw Polyphemus, which was standing in her frame to season. She was launched in 1782 and commissioned under Captain William C. Finch, who then sailed her to Gibraltar. She was part of a British fleet under Admiral Richard Howe successfully resupplied Gibraltar, then under siege by Bourbon forces. Shortly after, the British fleet met the Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Luis de C√≥rdova y C√≥rdova on 20 October 1782. The consequent battle of Cape Spartel was indecisive. Polyphemus was part of the second division of the van, and suffered four men wounded. In late 1782, Admiral Sir Richard Hughes took a squadron that included Polyphemus, under Captain Thomas Sotheby, out to the West Indies. On their way the British encountered a French convoy off Martinique. The action of 6 December 1782 lasted 40 minutes, during which time , under Captain John Collins, captured the French 64-gun ship Solitaire, under Jean-Charles de Borda. Solitaire had 35 men killed and 55 wounded whilst Ruby had only two men wounded. Two days later the squadron arrived at Barbados. The Royal Navy took Solitaire into service as HMS Solitaire. Polyphemus shared with Ruby in the head money for the capture of Solitaire, while the other vessels of the British squadron did not, suggesting that Polyphemus assisted Ruby. At the end of the war in 1783, her crew was paid off in June. Then she received some repairs between December 1783 and December 1784. French Revolutionary Wars In December 1793, after the outbreak of war with France, Polyphemus underwent fitting that at Chatham that took until June 1794. Captain George Lumsdaine commissioned her in April. Irish station Polyphemus and shared in the recapture on 21 September 1795 of the vessel Hibberts. Polyphemus was operating off Queenstown, Ireland, on 22 October when she took possession at Cork of the Dutch 64-gun ship Overijsel (or Overyssel), which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS Overyessel. Polyphemus then became the flagship for Vice-Admiral Robert Kingsmill, at Queenstown, before undergoing repairs in May and June 1796 at Plymouth. In August Polyphemus left the East India fleet west of the Canaries and returned to Plymouth two weeks or so later.Lloyd's List, - accessed 10 December 2013. In December 1796, Polyphemus and were off the Irish coast when they captured the 14-gun French privateer schooner , of 100 tons bm and 80 men. The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name. On the 31st Polyphemus captured the Tartar. There was only a handful of ships based at Cork under Rear-Admiral Kingsmill, principally Polyphemus and a frigate squadron, in late December 1796 when the French launched the Exp√©dition d'Irlande, an attempt to create a republican uprising in Ireland. Polyphemus seized the transport on 30 December and captured the transport shortly afterwards, although the French frigate recaptured Suffren. On 5 January 1797 Polyphemus captured Tartu, of 44 guns and 625 men (including troops). The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Uranie. Polyphemus also captured another transport, but the weather being bad and night falling, she did not take possession. Lumsdaine reported that the transport was leaky and making distress signals, but that he was unable to assist. He thought it highly likely that she had sunk. This may have been the Fille-Unique, which sank in the Bay of Biscay on 6 January. Between November 1799 and March 1800 she underwent repairs at Chatham. She was recommissioned in 1799, again under Lumsdaine. Baltic service Captain John Lawford was appointed to command of Polyphemus on 1 August and took up his position on three days later.Markham (1891), pp.10-4. She sailed from Yarmouth on 9 August 1800, with a squadron under Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson in bound for Denmark. Because of lack of wind the faster sailing vessels had to tow the slower ones and it was 15 August before they reached The Skaw. The next day the whole squadron advanced as far as the mouth of the Sound where the Danes had anchored three 74-gun ships, later increased to four, between Kronberg Castle and the Swedish shore. Because of gales the Admiral sheltered his squadron in Elsinore Roads and then went in as far as Sophienberg Castle to talk with Lord Whitworth, who was negotiating with the Danish government.Sophienberg was a royal coastal summer residence built in 1744 that the Danish monarchy sold to the government in 1790. It is near Rungsted, a short train ride north of Copenhagen. After matters were resolved the squadron returned to Yarmouth in September. In March 1801, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves raised his flag on Polyphemus, replacing Kingsmill. Polyphemus was with the fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker that bombarded Copenhagen on 2 April. The British objective was to break up the second League of Armed Neutrality, which also included Sweden and Prussia, that Tzar Paul I of Russia had established. During the battle, Polyphemus and came to the assistance of the 50-gun fourth rate , which was being hard-pressed by the Danes' 56-gun ship Provesteenen, and succeeded in silencing her. Polyphemus lost six men killed, and 25 men wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle. The division of the North Sea fleet commanded by Admiral Thomas in Polyphemus returned to Yarmouth from the Baltic Sea on 13 July and then sailed to join Admiral Dickson's squadron blockading the Dutch fleet in the Texel.Dickson's squadron included , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and the hired armed lugger Speculator. At some point Graves transferred his flag to . In April 1802 Polyphemus went into ordinary, following the Treaty of Amiens that ended the war. Napoleonic Wars After war with France resumed in 1803, Polyphemus underwent fitting out at Chatham between March and September 1804. Captain Robert Redmill recommissioned her in July for the Channel, but apparently was only temporarily in command. Polyphemus joined the Cadiz squadron under Admiral John Orde.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.225-6. She shared with and in the proceeds from the capture on 26 November of the Spanish ship Virgen del Rosario. In late November or early December (different records disagree), Polyphemus, under Lawford's command, captured several Spanish ships. One was the San Joseph (alias Favourite). The snow Saint Josef had been sailing from La Guayra to Cadiz with a cargo of indigo, cocoa, cochineal, and cotton. Another was the Santo Christo, which had been sailing from Montevideo to Cadiz with a cargo of hides and copper.Lloyd's List, - accessed 10 December 2013 She also captured the St Edward. The St Edward (or Edward), was sailing from Vera Cruz to Cadiz with a cargo of cocoa, cochineal, and cotton, and $98,539. Lastly, Polyphemus captured the Bon Air, which was sailing from Vera Cruz to Cadiz with a cargo of cocoa, indigo, and cochineal, and $20,000. Three days later Polyphemus and captured the Spanish frigate Santa Gertruyda off Cape St Mary. A frigate of 40-guns, she was armed only with 14, and was sailing from Peru and Mexico to Coruna when Polyphemus captured her. Polyphemus and Santa Gertruyda separated in a gale that damaged the Spanish ship, which nonetheless reached Plymouth on 10 January 1805, in tow by the armed defence ship Harriet, which had encountered Santa Gertruyda some days after the gale. Santa Gertruyda was carrying $1,215,000, and merchandize.Lloyd's List, - accessed 10 December 2013. Once she arrived in Plymouth, the Royal Navy took her into service as , but did not commission the 40-year-old ship. Instead she served as a receiving ship. Lawford was still in command on 8 February 1805 when Polyphemus captured Marianna. She arrived in Plymouth a few days later.Lloyd's List, - accessed 11 December 2013. Trafalgar Under Redmill, Polyphemus took part in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. She fought in the Lee column, and lost two men killed and four wounded. She engaged the French ships and and after the battle captured the . Lastly, Polyphemus towed , carrying Nelson's body, back to Gibraltar.\\"The Trafalgar Roll\\", by Colonel Robert Holden MacKenzie, 1913, pp. 246-7, ed 2004, Chatham Publishing, Parliament voted a grant of ¬£300,000 to the participants in the battle, payable in September 1806. Then in March 1807 there was a distribution of prize money for the hull, stores, and head money for four French and two Spanish ships captured at Trafalgar. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Trafalgar\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle. In January 1806, Polyphemus and the frigate were escorting a convoy from Gibraltar when they encountered a French squadron under Admiral Willaumez. The French succeeded in capturing two of the merchant vessels and four of the French fleet unsuccessfully chased Sirius for two hours, but forcing her to separate from the convoy.James (1837), Vol. 4, p.186. On 3 April 1806 Polyphemus, , and were off Madeira, having escorted the East India Fleet southward.Lloyd's List, - accessed 11 December 2013. Seventeen days later, Polyphemus shared in the capture of the Spanish ship Estrella. One week later Polyphemus, Fame, and Africa shared in the capture of the Spanish ship San Pablo and her cargo. St Pablo (or St Pablus), was sailing from Vera Cruz with a valuable cargo.Lloyd's List, - accessed 11 December 2013. French coast In July 1806, she was with Lord St. Vincent's squadron off Ushant. On 14 July her boats, together with others of the squadron, were taken by the Iris to Captain John Tremayne Rodd in Indefatigable off Rochefort to attack two French corvettes and a convoy at the entrance to the Garonne. The weather on 15 July appeared suitable for the attempt but after the boats left a strong wind blew up and although they managed to capture the corvette or brig Caesar, they could not prevent the convoy escaping up river. The French were expecting the attack and put up a strong resistance. The British lost six men killed, 36 wounded and 21 missing. Indefatigable alone lost two killed and 11 wounded. Polyphemus had two men lightly wounded. The 21 missing men were in a boat from ; a later report suggested that most, if not all, had been taken prisoner. The majority of the boats were either shot through or so badly stove in that they were swamped, and had to be cut adrift from the brig as she was brought out under fire from the batteries and the ex-British brig . The vessels claiming prize money included and the hired armed lugger Nile, in addition to the various ships of the line and frigates. This cutting out expedition resulted in the participants qualifying for the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"16 July Boat Service 1806\\". Caesar, of 18 guns, had a crew of 86 men according to her roster, and was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Louis Fran√ßois Hector Fourr√©. She was five years old, coppered, 88' by 23', and \\"appears fit for His Majesty's Service\\", according to Rodd. The Royal Navy took her into service as the brig HMS Cesar. Head money for the capture was paid in June 1829. In July 1806 Polyphemus was recommissioned. Captain Joseph O. Masefield replaced Redmill in September. In the action of 25 September 1806, a British squadron of six ships of the line that was keeping a close blockade of the port as part of the Atlantic campaign of 1806 intercepted a French squadron comprising five frigates and two corvettes, sailing to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements. The British ships, under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood sighted the French convoy shortly after it left Biscay port of Rochefort. The British caught the French convoy after a five- hour pursuit, although they had become separated from one another during the chase. The British captured the French frigates Infatigable, Minerve, Armide, and Gloire. Polyphemus shared in the prize money for these four frigates. Captain John Broughton replaced Masefield in October. Americas In 1807 Polyphemus, under the command of Captain Peter Heywood, became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir George Murray, off South America. In March Murray's squadron carried troops from the Cape of Good Hope to South America in support of a second failed attempt to wrest the River Plate area from the Spanish. A detachment of sailors and marines from Polyphemus served on shore in the Advance Brigade during the disastrous (for the British) attack on Buenos Aires. Admiral Murray evacuated Lieutenant Crowley of Polyphemus, who had been wounded, and his men, aboard the frigate {[shipFrench frigateN√©r√©ide17792}}. Polyphemus remained in the River Plate area, carrying out surveying and merchant vessel protection duties. Between January and February 1808 Polyphemus underwent a refit at Portsmouth. Heywood remained in command until May 1808, when Captain William Pryce Cumby replaced him. Cumby had been lieutenant and then acting commander of at Trafalgar. Polyphemus became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Bartholomew Samuel Rowley. In July she sailed for Jamaica, convoying a large fleet of merchantmen, and taking the Vice-Admiral to take up his appointment as chief of the station. Since he resided on shore with his flag in , Polyphemus was able to undertake cruises against the enemy. On the morning of 14 November Cumby sent his boats, under Lieutenant Joseph Daly in the barge, to chase a schooner attempting to enter the harbour at San Domingo. An hour later the British succeed in boarding the schooner despite facing a hail of grape and musketry. Their quarry proved to be the French navy schooner Colibry, of three carriage guns and a crew of 63 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Deyrisse. The French lost one man killed and five wounded; Polyphemus had one man killed. On 17 April 1809, a British squadron captured the French 74-gun during Troude's expedition to the Caribbean. The initial distribution of prize money excluded Polyphemus and Tweed, who appealed. Polyphemuss appeal succeeded. On 28 April Polyphemus recaptured Carlotta, Duncan, master, and sent her into Jamaica. Carlotta had been sailing from St Batholomew's to Jacmel when a French privateer captured her.Lloyd's List, - accessed 11 December 2013. In June 1809 Cumby received command of a squadron consisting of Polyphemus, , , , , , , , , and . They sailed from Port Royal on 7 June with troops under Major-General Hugh Lyle Carmichael to assist the Spanish forces besieging the French in the city of San Domingo. On 1 July Polyphemus anchored at Caleta and loaded eight of her 24-pounder guns into Sparrow for landing at Palenqui for the use of the batteries west of the city. Captain Burt of Sparrow then transported two of the guns from Andre Bay to the east battery, nearly 30 miles across almost impassable country. The French garrison surrendered on 6 July. Cumby signed the terms of capitulation in his capacity as senior officer in command of \\"His Majesty's Ships and Vessels before the City of Santo Domingo.\\" One payment of prize money occurred in October 1832. Captain Cumby was appointed to in March 1811. His successor on Polyphemus was Captain T. Graves; Captain Douglas later replaced Graves. Under Douglas's command, Polyphemus recaptured Diana and Fame on 13 and 14 September. In August 1812 Polyphemus and escorted a fleet of 47 merchant vessels sailing from Jamaica to London. On the 20th, the US revenue cutter James Madison started shadowing the fleet as the fleet sailed some distance off Savannah, Georgia, seeking to capture what she could. Two days later, Barbadoes succeeded in capturing James Madison after a seven-hour chase. The British immediately fitted out James Madison for the protection of the fleet. They put two officers and 40 men on board, drawn from Barbadoes, and those men of James Madisons existing crew that were willing to change sides. On 26 August a hurricane came up that scattered the vessels of the convoy. It also totally dis-masted Barbadoes, which limped back to Jamaica, and sprung Polyphemuss main and foremasts. James Madison was able to regather 21 vessels of the convoy. On 3 September an American privateer schooner of 14 guns started shadowing James Madison and the vessels she was escorting. During the subsequent four days the privateer stayed close enough to exchange occasional shots with James Madison, but did not succeed in capturing anything. On 3 October Polyphemus and James Madison arrived separately at Portsmouth.Lloyd's List, - accessed 3 December 2013. Prize money for the capture was payable in March 1815. In October Polyphemus detained the American vessel Amazon, from Philadelphia, and sent her into Portsmouth. Amazon arrived there on 4 October. Fate Polyphemus paid off at Chatham in November 1812. In 1813 she was converted to serve as a powder hulk, and she was eventually broken up in 1827.Lavery, Ships of the Line vol.1, p181.

It was founded in 1990 by Lennice Werth. Prominent members include Roy Scherer and Michael Krawitz. The organization reviews the Virginia General Assembly's bills every year, sending out emails to a network of citizens and urging them to contact their legislators on relevant issues. It recent years they have moved much of their notifications to social media, primarily Facebook. Their activists persuaded the legislature to carve out an exemption in the marijuana cultivation law so that individuals growing cannabis for their own use would be prosecuted only for simple possession. Virginia thus has more lenient laws on cultivation than even California. In addition, their activists successfully lobbied the General Assembly to keep medical marijuana legal for cancer and glaucoma, and to put marijuana in a class by itself, as opposed to being a scheduled controlled substance. More recently they have has worked with Virginia NORML and Cannabis Commonwealth.

Currently, there is one globally developed open extensible markup language based standard framework built on a rich heritage of electronic business experience. It consists of five layers - messaging, registry and repository, collaboration protocol, core components and business processes.United Nations, Asian Development Bank, & Korea (South). (2006). E-procurement. [Bangkok]: United Nations Publications. pp. 22-23.  History  It was first used by IBM in the year 2000, when the company launched its Replenishment Management System and Method, created by Mexican engineer Daniel Delf√≠n, who was then the procurement director at IBM's largest production plant, and Alberto Wario, an IT programmer. The system was designed to solve IBM's complex procurement process for the plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, the largest IBM laptop producing plant in the World, with a production value of 1.6 billion dollars a year. Three years after the system was implemented, the production of the plant grew to 3.6 billion dollars, after which, the company used the system in Germany, and later sold using licenses to other companies around the World. In the European Union, e-procurement for the public sector was first introduced with the Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004. These Directives, which were subsequently revised in 2014,Directive 2014/24/EU of The European Parliament and of The Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC.

E-procurement value chain  As mentioned above, e-procurement value chain consists of indent management, e-Informing, e-Tendering, e-Auctioning, vendor management, catalogue management, Purchase Order Integration, Order Status, Ship Notice, e-invoicing, e-payment, and contract management.  e-Informing  E-Informing does not directly take part in the purchasing process, this process rather precedes the purchasing. It is the process of gathering and distributing purchasing information both from and to internal and external parties, using the internet technology.CHEPKWONY, Joel Kipkemboi a Charles LAGAT.

Retrieved from: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1666/b42dacd6708aa4a606e7468167fea0827c5e.pdf Information sharing refers to the extent to which critical and proprietary information is communicated to one's supply chain partner thus more efficiency and high performance of the supply chain. In information sharing, also information quality is considered. That includes accuracy, timeliness, adequacy, and credibility of information exchanged.Li, S., Rao, S. S., Ragunathan, T. S., & Ragunathan, B. (2005). Development and validation of a measurement instrument for studying supply chain management practices, Journal of Operations Management 23(6). This process occurs especially in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).  e-Tendering  The purpose of e-tendering is to enhance the process of tendering for the procurement of specialized works, goods or consulting services of low volume but have high value.United Nations, Asian Development Bank, & Korea (South). (2006). E-procurement. [Bangkok]: United Nations Publications. pp. 14.  e-Auctioning  E-auction is the process of conducting an auction to sell assets, natural resources or other goods through online competitive bidding. Compared to physical auction, electronic auction provides complete transparency and enables more parties to take part.BHAGAT, Rasheeda. All you wanted to know about: e-Auctions.

Retrieved from: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/All-you-wanted-to-know- about-e-Auctions/article20913564.ece Vendor management It occurs when contracting authority aims to control costs, drive service excellence and mitigate risks to gain increased value from their vendors throughout the procurement process. Contract management departments are often established in order to ensure the most effective deal.  Catalogue management  Catalogue management is strategic process that starts when suppliers publish their product portfolio electronically and products are made available to buyers in order to procure goods and services electronically, and appears while managing the product catalog to ensure the quality of the product data across the sales channels. The product content can be hosted either by the supplier or buyer.CATALOGUE MANAGEMENT. KB manage [online]. 2018 [cit. 2019-04-22]. Retrieved from: https://www.kbmanage.com/concept/catalogue- management  e-Purchasing  As opposed to e-Tendering, e-Purchasing is used in procurement of goods and services that are of low value and high volume. It electronically simplifies the purchasing process of such goods and services. For this type of procurement, catalogues are one of the key components that often occurs. Key components of this system are often complex and thus system development is often needed. The process starts from publication of items online by the suppliers, and continues to the electronic selection, order, reception, and finishes with payment by the purchasing side.  e-Ordering  Process of creating and approving purchasing requisition, both placing purchase orders and receiving goods and services ordered, while using a software system based on internet technology which greatly improves the supply chain performance. When talking about e-ordering, ordered goods and services are generally non-product related, in other words - indirect. In case of Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) the goods and services ordered are product related. Both the supporting software system as well as ordering catalogue system are designed to be used by all employees of an organization.  e-Invoicing  E-Invoicing is any method by which an invoice is electronically presented to a customer for payment.Tieto. (2009). The future of E-invoicing, Pg. 5. Retrieved from https://web.archive.org/web/20121021043042/http://www.digitdoc.hu/downloads/e_invoicing.pdf In larger companies, accounts payable departments are responsible for the invoices to be approved, processed, and paid.Accounting Tools.

Retrieved from accountingtools: http://www.accountingtools.com/accounts-payable-controls  e-Contract Management  This type of management consists of management of receivables, payments, contract settlements, contract variations, performance securities, and auditing and control activities, and as opposed to its classical form, e-Contract Management is its electronic improvement.  In the public sector  E-procurement in the public sector is emerging internationally. Hence, initiatives have been implemented in Bangladesh, Mongolia, Ukraine, India, Singapore, Estonia, United Kingdom, United States, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, European Union. Public sector organizations use e-procurement for contracts to achieve benefits such as increased efficiency and cost savings (faster and cheaper) in government procurement and improved transparency (to reduce corruption) in procurement services. E-procurement in the public sector has seen rapid growth in recent years. Act 590 of Louisiana's 2008 Regular Legislative Session requires political subdivisions to make provisions for the receipt of electronic bids. E-procurement projects are often part of the country's general e-Government efforts to better serve its citizens and businesses in the digital economy. For example, Singapore's GeBIZ was implemented as one of the programmes under its e-Government masterplan. The Procurement G6 leads the use of e-procurement instruments in Public procurement. An example of successful reform is shown by Ukraine Prozorro. The result of collaboration between Ukrainian government, business sector, and civil society. This system was developed by the international anti-corruption organization, Transparency International Ukraine, with the help of volunteers, NGOs, business community and state bodies of Ukraine, the WNISEF fund, the EBRD and other partners.  Vendors  This field is populated by two types of vendors: big enterprise resource planning (ERP) providers which offer e-procurement as one of their services, and the more affordable services focused specifically on e-procurement such as Eyvo (https://www.e-procurement.com).  Benefits and Disadvantages= Benefits  Implementing an e-procurement system benefits all levels of an organization. E-procurement systems offer improved spend visibility and control and help finance officers match purchases with purchase orders, receipts and job tickets.\\"What is e procurement?\\" An e-procurement system also manages tenders through a web site. An example is the 'System for Acquisition Management (SAM)' which on July 30, 2013, combined information from the former Central Contractor Registration and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), in the United States. In the case of government procurement, the benefits might be efficiency, transparency, equity, fairness and encouragement of local business. Because e-procurement increases competition, lowers transaction costs, and has potential to minimize time and errors in the bidding process, efficiency is achieved. Because of easier accessibility and openness of the internet, more people can attain earlier informations, which increases transparency. Neutrality to location and time ensures equity and fairness.United Nations, Asian Development Bank, & Korea (South). (2006). E-procurement. [Bangkok]: United Nations Publications. pp. 6-7.  Disadvantages  Because the vendor is obtaining more information about the customer than in case of normal supply chain management structure, major disadvantage of e-procurement might be incentive of the vendor to take advantage of the customer.Chen J. and Paulraj A., Understanding supply chain management: critical research and a theoretical framework, International Journal of Production Research, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2004, pp. 131-163.

Retrieved from 'United Nations' on 1 August 2013 Turkey In Turkey mobile phones have penetrated 23.3 Million (34%) of 69.6 Million populations compared to 4.3 Million (6%) internet users. Even though there is an increase in mobile connections the mobile internet penetration rate is very low. Therefore, the m-government applications are confined to G2G or G2C based on SMS and GPRS technologies. These applications are in their early stages but still are considered to be better than traditional way of service provision. Some of the major mobile application in Turkey are the following: MOBESE (Mobile Electronic System Integration) ‚Äì It is a G2G application and is used by law enforcement agency. It connects the law enforcement agency to respective local level Police Station to validate citizen identity or checking their record history etc. TBS (Traffic Information System) ‚Äì It Helps in checking offending drivers license and vehicle information. Local Government Applications ‚Äì In some municipalities, SMS technology is used by citizens to pay their taxes. They are also used for local level polling. Czech Republic In Czech Republic, mobile phones have penetrated in 95% of the 10 million populations, one of the highest in Europe and probably in the world. Since the penetration of mobile technology is very high, m-government applications are more effective and quick.

Founded in 1965, it is part of the University of Wisconsin System. As of Fall 2016, student enrollment was approximately 7,030, including 6,758 undergraduate students. Since its founding, the school had an environmental sustainability emphasis (nicknamed \\"Eco U\\" in the 1970s by Newsweek), and offers associate's, bachelor's, and master's degree programs. The university's mascot is the Phoenix. History By 1958, the University of Wisconsin-Extension's Green Bay center had grown to 500 students, the second- largest of UW-Extension's eight freshman-sophomore centers. It grew to become the largest by 1965. Demand soon grew for a full-fledged four-year campus serving northeastern Wisconsin. In 1963, the Coordinating Committee for Higher Education unanimously recommended building a new university in the Fox Valley. Governor Warren Knowles, who was somewhat cool to the idea, proposed that the freshman-sophomore campuses in Green Bay and Kenosha be expanded to four-year institutions (the Kenosha institution eventually became the University of Wisconsin-Parkside). The bill was signed into law on September 2, 1965. UW‚ÄìGreen Bay officially came into being in the fall of 1968, with the first classes being held at the Deckner Center (now Anne Sullivan Elementary School), home of the former Green Bay extension center. It moved to its current location in the fall of 1969. In 2018, as part of a UW System restructuring that merged 13 two-year schools with seven four year schools, UW-Green Bay took responsibility for the former UW-Marinette, UW-Sheboygan, and UW-Manitowoc branches, turning them into University of Wisconsin‚ÄîGreen Bay Marinette, Sheboygan, and Manitowoc campuses. Academics Originally, the university's two governing bodies, the College of Professional Studies and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences supervised all academic programs, but the university put forth a restructuring plan in 2016 that divided the two into four new colleges.  Austin E. Cofrin School of Business  Named for Austin E. Cofrin, a local philanthropist, the school was constituted in 2010 after Cofrin's son, David (who the campus library is named after) donated money to establish the program. Cofrin's donation was the largest for an academic program since the university's founding. The Cofrin School of Business oversees the accounting, business administration, and international business majors.  College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences  The CAHSS oversees the most majors of any of the university's four colleges, including all arts-related majors (both fine and performing), all humanities majors, all social science majors, the university's communication program, and the economics and information science programs.https://www.uwgb.edu/cahss/units-programs/  College of Health, Education and Social Welfare  The CHESW oversees the university's professional programs, including education, healthcare management, social work, and the joint nursing programs that the university maintains with the nearby Bellin College of Nursing.  College of Science, Engineering and Technology  The CSET oversees all science-related majors, in addition to mathematics and the university's Engineering Technology program.  Removal of interdisciplinary requirement  Until 2017, the university mandated that students complete at least one interdisciplinary major or minor in order to ensure a more well-rounded education. As an example, a student in a major classified as disciplinary, such as music, accounting, biology, or English was required to complete either a double major or a minor in a field with some professional applications considered interdisciplinary, such as business administration, communication, or computer science. In late 2017, faculty members on the school's University Committee (of the Faculty Senate) proposed to remove the requirement in the interest of streamlining the academic process, a proposal that was controversial but ultimately passed.  Top majors  The university's top majors, by degrees granted, are: # Business Administration # Integrative Leadership Studies (an online-only BA/BS program targeted at non-traditional students) # Psychology # Human Biology # Nursing (includes both BSN and MSN, joint program with the Bellin College of Nursing) # Human Development # Communication # Elementary Education # Social Work # Accounting Campus Map of campus The 200-acre campus is on the northeast side of Green Bay, overlooking Lake Michigan's Green Bay. Much of the campus is composed of natural areas, with the campus bordered on one side by the bay and on the other by the Niagara Escarpment. A system of circular roads (North, East, and South Circle Drives) surrounds the central campus and are the main thoroughfares for traffic on campus, in addition to a few smaller roads that connect the Circle Drives with parking lots. The Cofrin Memorial Arboretum forms a natural boundary of 290 acres encircling the campus. It offers recreation, field trips, and research projects. The purpose of the Arboretum is to restore and preserve some of Wisconsin's native ecological communities and to offer an opportunity to enjoy and appreciate nature. It has more than six miles of trails open to the public. The David A. Cofrin Library sits at the heart of campus, and is one of the tallest buildings in the Green Bay area. Adjacent to the library in the central part of campus are all academic buildings, the University Union (UW-Green Bay's student union), and the Weidner Center for the Performing Arts. All of the university's residential buildings (with the exception of a female-only house adjacent to campus) are in the northeast part of campus, and include traditional residence halls, shared-bedroom apartments, and newer private bedroom apartments. The Richard Mauthe Center (formerly known as the Ecumenical Center) is just south of the residence halls and serves as the campus' religious center. The Mauthe Center is one of two buildings on campus that are run semi-independently of the university, the other being the Weidner Center. The Kress Events Center and various athletic fields dominate the southeast part of campus. A university- owned golf course, the Shorewood Golf Course, takes up the majority of the northern side of campus. Across Nicolet Drive, the road that forms the western border of the university, are two university-owned properties, Lambeau Cottage and Communiversity Park. Lambeau Cottage was owned by Green Bay Packers founder Curly Lambeau from 1941 to 1956, and was acquired by the state in 1978. The building served many purposes, including a retreat center and headquarters for the sailing team, but fell into disrepair over time. In 2005, an alumnus provided a donation to restore the Lambeau Cottage, and it again finds itself typically used for university retreats. Communiversity Park is a small park adjacent to the Lambeau Cottage and overlooks the bay. Facilities =Weidner Center for the Performing Arts Weidner Center The Weidner Center for the Performing Arts contains the 2,000-seat Cofrin Family Hall, the 200-seat Fort Howard Hall for recitals, the 99-seat-in-the-round Jean Weidner Theatre, and a dance studio. Cofrin Memorial Arboretum David A. Cofrin Library The Cofrin Library has a collection of more than one million items, and the Special Collections Department contains historical records of northeastern Wisconsin, genealogical records, and a local business archives collection. The library's top floor is home to university administration as well as viewpoints for notable landmarks within the area. Kress Events Center Kress Events Center The Kress Events Center is the host for Phoenix Athletics, concerts, and university-wide events and is the headquarters for workouts, weight training, and intramural sports. The facility has an athletics training room, weight rooms, cardio deck, pool, racquetball courts, a climbing tower, outdoor playing fields, and a multipurpose gymnasium for basketball, volleyball and indoor tennis. LeMieux Chapel Joseph LeMieux was a stonemason who built lighthouses on the Great Lakes. His brother-in-law, Fabian LaPlant, was a carpenter. Together they teamed to build the LeMieux Chapel. Student housing UWGB has 28 residential buildings, including traditional residence halls, apartment style residence halls, and student apartments. Approximately 2,000 students live on campus. Concourse 'tunnel' system The UW-Green Bay main campus has a concourse system of underground corridors, casually referred to as \\"tunnels\\", that connect eleven of its buildings. Designed with the David A. Cofrin Library at its center, subterranean hallways branch out to Student Services, the University Union and seven academic buildings. Opposite the adjacent Theatre Hall and Studio Arts buildings that form an arts wing is a sciences wing comprises Instructional Services, Environmental Sciences and Laboratory Sciences buildings. To the west of the library are the L.G. Wood and John M. Rose Halls. Constructed in 2002, Mary Ann Cofrin Hall is the newest building in the concourse system. Campus buildings not connected by the concourse system are the residence halls, Kress Center, the Weidner Center, and the Brown County STEM and Innovation Center which broke ground September 17, 2018. In addition to helping faculty, staff and students navigate campus in adverse weather, the concourse system facilitates accessibility. Activities The student body participates in issues regarding university governance through the Student Government Association, which consists of an executive branch, a legislative branch, and a judicial branch (the Student Court). Athletics UW-Green Bay, which brands itself athletically as \\"Green Bay\\", is an NCAA Division I school, and is a member of the Horizon League. The Green Bay women's basketball team has won or tied for the Horizon League regular-season championship nine times, including the last eight years. The team has been to the NCAA tournament eight times, including four of the last five years. It has also made two appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). The team received its first national ranking in 2003, when it was ranked as high as #16 in both the Associated Press poll and the Coaches' Poll. In 2005, it also received a national ranking and a bid to the NCAA Tournament, but was knocked out in the first round by Maryland. In 2006, it appeared in the WNIT, where it lost to Iowa State in a first-round game. The next season, it was seeded #9 in the NCAA Tournament, where it defeated New Mexico in the first round before falling to top-seeded Connecticut in the second round. That loss ended their school record and nation-leading 26-game winning streak. The next NCAA Tournament win for the Phoenix women came in 2010, when they entered as a #12 seed and upset 5-seed Virginia in the first round before bowing out to Iowa State on the Cyclones' home court just short of the Sweet 16. In the 2011 tournament, they entered as a #5 seed and made their first Sweet Sixteen appearance, defeating Arkansas‚ÄìLittle Rock and Michigan State before losing to regional top seed Baylor. The Green Bay softball team claimed its first Horizon League tournament championship in 2005. It went on to the national tournament, where it defeated #5 seed Oregon State in the first round.

He was the first permanent European settler on the Miramichi River in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick.  Arrival in the New World  Davidson was born in Cowford, in the Parish of Bellie, Moray, Scotland, and was engaged in salmon fishing as a young man (see River Spey). He was born John Godsman, but changed his name to William Davidson after his grandfather. In 1765 he arrived in Nova Scotia and obtained extensive land grants, he and a partner getting 100,000 acres (400 km¬≤), of which 2/3 was Davidson's share. This amounted to a strip of on either side of the Miramichi River (then a part of Nova Scotia) with fishing and lumbering rights. He was required to clear and improve the land and establish one Protestant settler for every two acres (8,000 m¬≤). He settled many people on the Miramichi. Davidson is best known as the first settler in the Miramichi.  Founding a colony  Davidson went to New England in 1766 to recruit settlers and supplies. Soon he was shipping fish to the West Indies and furs and fish to Europe. To employ his workers in the winter he began to cut lumber and brought out from Great Britain a master shipbuilder, shipwrights and other craftsmen. Throughout his life this visionary, practical, industrious and intelligent man was plagued by bad luck. His first locally built ship, the Miramichi, sank off Spain on her maiden voyage and his second ship was wrecked in 1775 off the northern tip of Prince Edward Island. But, other cargoes got through and he soon had a seven-year contract with a British firm to supply fish and lumber.  The American Revolution and the Saint John River  In 1776 the American Revolutionary War, came along and New England privateers made sailing in the North Atlantic unsafe and rebel sympathizers stirred up the neighbouring Mi'kmaq Indian nation. With shipping so hazardous, the British firm he contracted with was soon bankrupt. The Mi'kmaq began raids on the Miramichi settlers, and in 1777 Davidson withdrew inland with his employees to Maugerville, a settlement on the Saint John River downstream from the site of present city of Fredericton, New Brunswick. Ever industrious, Davidson soon secured a contract to transport ship's masts and yards down the Saint John River to the port of Saint John for shipment to the Royal Navy. In 1783 Davidson was elected a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for Sunbury County. The American Revolutionary War was now over and Davidson moved back to the Miramichi Valley to secure his land grants. He went by ship with his employees and stopped en route at Halifax, Nova Scotia for supplies.  Back to the Miramichi  Davidson lost no time on his return to the Miramichi. Most of his employees came with him. He spent 5,000 pounds sterling on a shipyard, a sawmill and stores and other buildings and was soon back in business. In the period 1783 to 1785 he lost several more vessels and their cargoes to the North Atlantic. But some got through and he signed a contract with Wm. Forsyth and Co. of Greenock, Scotland and Halifax, Nova Scotia to provide masts and yards. He also shipped fish to the West Indies and Europe. To provide another source of revenue, Davidson sent out employees to fish for cod in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. But United Empire Loyalists were pouring into the Maritime Provinces and in 1784 Loyalist settlers in the Saint John River Valley set up New Brunswick as a separate colony. They were land hungry and revoked Davidson's grant on the grounds that he had not brought out the settlers he promised. He was compensated with a grant of 14,500 acres (59 km¬≤), including the sites of his enterprises. William Davidson was elected as representative from Northumberland County to the 1st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly and served from 1786 until his death. Davidson was out on snowshoes on business in the winter of 1790, when he was caught in a blizzard. He suffered severely and caught a cold from which he did not recover. He died in June, 1790.  Family and legacy  When he was living at Maugerville, Davidson married Sarah Nevers. They had five children. One of his brothers settled close to him. Many thousands of people in the Miramichi and across North America are descendants of the Davidson brothers. He died on 17 June 1790. Davidson was complimented by a contemporary for his \\"...genius and high abilities\\". He must be seen in the context of the great age of the Scottish people. His personal characteristics, industry, vision, practical ability, persistence, and intelligence are the hallmarks of a people who were pioneers in exploration (Alexander Mackenzie, Simon Fraser and David Livingstone), industry (Andrew Carnegie), science (Kelvin), philosophy (David Hume) and politics( Sir John A. Macdonald). Davidson accomplished much, was not deterred by misfortunes which would discourage most, and was the true founder of a distinctive people, the Miramichiers.  Portrait  A large portrait of William Davidson felling trees on the Miramichi hangs on an internal staircase of the Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta. This is very appropriate as Davidson was a native of Moray, very near the boundary with Banffshire, Scotland. The painting has been in the possession of the hotel for many years, and hotel staff believe that it was painted in the last years of the 19th century. It identifies Davidson as Canada's first lumberman, surely a misnomer. He was, perhaps, the first English speaking person to establish a significant commercial lumber business in Canada. But long before, French settlers cut trees for their own use and for local markets.  Acknowledgement  W. S.

An influential member of the Giverny art colony, his paintings often concentrated on various effects of dappled sunlight. He is especially known for painting female subjects, both indoors and out. Background and early life In 1858, Frederick Carl Frieseke's grandparents, Frederick Frieseke and his wife, emigrated from Pritzerbe (near Brandenburg, Germany) with their sons, including Herman Carl. They settled in the small central Michigan town of Owosso. Herman served in the Union Army then returned to Owosso, where he established a brick manufacturing business. He married Eva Graham and in 1871 their daughter Edith was born. Their son, Frederick Carl, was born in Owosso in 1874. Eva died in 1880 when Frederick was six years old, and in about 1881 the family moved to Florida. Herman started another brick manufacturing business in Jacksonville. The four years in Florida left an enduring impression on young Frederick; years later, when he contemplated a return to the United States from Europe, he concentrated on Florida. Frederick's aunt recounted how, unlike most boys, he was interested in the arts more than in sports. His grandmother, Valetta Gould Graham, enjoyed painting, and encouraged Frederick in his artistic pursuits. An 1893 visit to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago also stimulated his desire to become an artist. Education Holland 1898 In 1893, Frieseke graduated from Owosso High School, then began his artistic training at the Art Institute of Chicago, studying with Frederick Warren Freer and John Vanderpoel. After moving to New York in 1895, he resumed his art education at the Art Students League in 1897. He worked as an illustrator, selling cartoons he had drawn to The New York Times, Puck, and Truth. He claimed that he might have curtailed his art education if he had been more successful in that endeavor. The following year, he moved to France, where he would remain, except for short visits to the United States and elsewhere, as an expatriate for the rest of his life. He did continue his education, enrolling at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, studying under Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens, and receiving criticism from Auguste-Joseph Delecluse. His studies also included some time at Acad√©mie Carmen under James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Frieseke visited Holland, including the Katwijk and Laren artist colonies, in the summer of 1898. During this time he sketched and painted in watercolors, and he initially planned to make that his specialty, but he was encouraged by Acad√©mie Carmen instructor Frederick William MacMonnies to work in oils. Frieseke discounted his formal art education, referring to himself as self- taught; he felt that he had learned more from his independent study of artists' work than he had from his academic studies. Life and work Mrs. Frieseke at the Kitchen Window, 1912 Starting in 1899, just over a year since his arrival in Paris, Frieseke exhibited at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Whistler's influence is evident in Frieseke's early mature paintings, with close tonalities. By his post-1900 work, his palette had evolved toward that of the Impressionists, becoming light and colorful; however, he still retained the strong linear customs of art back in the United States. In the summer of 1905, he spent at least a month in the Giverny art colony. In October of that year he married Sarah Anne O'Bryan (known as Sadie), whom he had met seven years earlier. Frieseke and his wife (and later, their daughter) spent every summer from 1906 to 1919 in Giverny. He kept a Paris apartment and studio throughout his life, and the Friesekes spent the winters in Paris. Their Giverny house, previously the residence of Theodore Robinson, was next door to Claude Monet's. Despite the proximity, Frieseke did not become close friends with Monet, nor was Monet an artistic influence. He said in an interview, \\"No artist in [the impressionist] school has influenced me except, perhaps, Renoir.\\" Indeed, Frieseke's paintings of sensually rounded figures often bear a resemblance to those of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The House in Giverny, ca. 1912 The Friesekes' Giverny home and the garden they created there were often featured in his paintings, and his wife would frequently pose for him. He also kept another studio nearby on the Epte river. Many of his outdoor nudes were painted there. After spending some time in Giverny, his unique style quickly emerged, and he would be quite influential with most of the other members of the colony. Although well known as an Impressionist, some of his work, with its \\"intense, almost arbitrary colors\\", demonstrates the Post-Impressionist influence of artists Paul Gauguin and Pierre Bonnard. The term \\"Decorative Impressionism\\" was coined by an art writer to refer to Frieseke's style. It combined the decorative style of Les Nabis, expressively using color and pattern, with classic Impressionist interests in atmosphere and sunlight. He was very interested in rendering sunlit subjects on canvas, saying, \\"It is sunshine, flowers in sunshine; girls in sunshine; the nude in sunshine, which I have been principally interested in. If I could only reproduce it exactly as I see it I would be satisfied.\\" However, his interpretation of sunshine often did not appear natural. According to a recent observer, \\"His light hardly seems to be plein air light at all. In fact it seems entirely artificial ... a stunning concoction of blues and magentas frosted with early summer green and flecks of white.\\" The prestigious Venice Biennale featured seventeen Frieseke paintings in 1909. Frieseke's artistic influence was greatly felt among the Americans in Giverny, most of whom shared his Midwestern background and had also begun their art studies in Chicago. Among those artists were Louis Ritman, Karl Anderson, Lawton Parker, and Karl Buehr. Cherry Blossoms, ca. 1913 Frieseke preferred the attitudes in France over those which he encountered in the United States: \\"I am more free and there are not the Puritanical restrictions which prevail in America ‚Äì here I can paint the nude out of doors.\\" He found the American attitudes to be frustrating, but occasionally a source of amusement. While on his first visit back home in Owosso in 1902, Frieseke wrote, \\"I get much pleasure in shocking the good Church people with the nudes\\". The Friesekes' only child, daughter Frances, was born in 1914. In 1920 Frieseke and his family moved to a farm in Le Mesnil-sur-Blangy, Normandy. His art of this period concentrated on female figures, particularly nudes. While developing a more modern style, he included historical and contemporary references. He used a darker color palette and limited his use of surface patterns. In these works, his interest in chiaroscuro may be discerned. In 1923 he left the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts and co-founded, with other artists, the Salon des Tuileries. He resumed painting in watercolors, especially while on trips to Nice in the winter and during a 1930 to 1932 visit to Switzerland. Frieseke had established a superb reputation during his career. A 1931 book refers to Frieseke as \\"one of the most prominent members of our self-exiled Americans.\\" He died in his Normandy home on August 24, 1939, of an aneurysm. Awards Summer, 1914 He won many awards during his career. In 1904 he received a silver medal in St. Louis at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and was awarded a gold medal at the Munich International Art Exposition. He was honored with the William A. Clark Prize at the Corcoran Gallery of Art's 1908 biennial, and the Temple Gold Medal in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts' annual exhibition of 1913. One of his greatest honors was winning the Grand Prize at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition, which was held in San Francisco in 1915. Among his entries was Summer, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The New York Times proclaimed in June 1915: \\"Mr. Frieseke, whose accomplished work is well known to New Yorkers, says the last word in the style that was modern before the Modernists came along. Whatever he does has a sense of design, color, and style. A sense of gayety, an entertaining and well considered pattern, a remarkable knowledge of the effect of outdoor light on color are found in nearly all of his most recent paintings.\\" He received two gold medals from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1920 and he also won the popular prize, decided by artists as well as the viewing public.

It is designed to recognize students for their academic and musical achievements and to provide leadership and service opportunities to young musicians. Each school has its own chapter, which is run by the students but supervised by an advisor or sponsor, usually a school teacher. There are approximately 6200 participating chapters in several countries. To be eligible for membership, a student must maintain an A average in their music classes, a C average in all of their academic courses, be presently enrolled in a music course at their school, and be recommended for membership by their school's music faculty. Tri-M was founded in 1936 by Alexander Harley and his wife, Frances. At the time, Alexander Harley was the band director and Music Department Chairman at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge, Illinois. It has been a program of MENC: The National Association for Music Education since 1983. In 2011, the name MENC was changed to NAfME or the National Association for Music Education.  History  A membership pin awarded to junior inductees of the Tri-M Music honor society. In 1935, Charles Himmel, Principal of Maine Township High School (Now Maine Township High School East) in Des Plaines/Park Ridge, Illinois approached Music Department Chairman Alexander M. Harley about beginning a music honor society for high school music students. Harley, along with his wife Frances began formulating a plan; they decided that the initiates should be among the finest technical and academic musicians at the high school. The entrance requirements were rigorous. In 1936, they initiated the first members of the \\"Maine Music Masters.\\" One of the first debates of this organization was whether to refer to themselves as TRI-M or 3M. For almost twenty years this organization worked to promote the values of service to the music program, the school, and the community. They were one of the first school organizations to organize canned food and clothing drives and community concerts at nursing homes, civic organizations, and community events. In one school year, the members of TRI-M presented over 300 concerts.  National expansion  In 1952, Maine Township High School Superintendent Harry D. Anderson attended the initiation of TRI-M and felt the organization could have broad appeal to other high schools. He urged Harley to incorporate. With the help of the History Department, TRI-M was incorporated as \\"Modern Music Masters.\\" Its membership steadily grew and it became an international organization with chapters as far away as Asia and Europe. Harley and his wife traversed the country to start chapters.  International expansion  There is a Tri-M chapter in The Baptist school Amman, located in Jordan. The Yongsan International School of Seoul also fosters Korea's first Junior Chapter Tri-M, as well as a Senior Chapter. The International School of Manila also has its own chapter of Tri-M in its high school. Seoul Foreign School, Concordia International School Shanghai, Taipei American School, Singapore American School, Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Shanghai American School, Nansha College Preparatory Academy, International Christian School , Korea International School Jeju, and The American School of Dubai also have Tri-M Music Honor Society chapters. The American Community School of Abu Dhabi has a thriving chapter as well.  Program of MENC  In 1983, the \\"Modern Music Masters\\" officially became a program of the Music Educators National Conference. Its name was changed to the TRI-M Music Honor Society and presently there are over 6200 chapters worldwide. TRI-M continues to promote the ideals of service to the school music program, the school-at-large, and the community. Alexander Harley died in 1989 and at his funeral, the school flags from the four Maine High Schools, carried by the TRI-M Presidents, were processed in honoring the vision of this man and his vision for music students everywhere. Frances died in 2004.

These electrodes are typical ion exchange resin membrane electrodes, using valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, as the ion carrier in the membrane to provide the potassium specificity. This type of ion-selective electrode is subject to interference from (in declining order of magnitude) rubidium, caesium, ammonium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and lithium. The most significant interference with measurement of potassium concentration is from the ammonium ion, which in practice is a problem where the ammonium concentration is approximately equal to or greater than the potassium concentration. Although sodium is usually present in high concentrations in biological preparations, the degree of interference is low enough to represent an error on the order of only 0.05 parts per million for the normal range of sodium concentration, requiring reduction of sodium only for measurements of very low potassium concentrations. Although the interference from rubidium or caesium is strong enough to require that these ions be present in much lower concentration than the potassium to be measured, this is not usually a problem in most experiments. Interference from calcium, magnesium, or lithium, on the other hand, is weak enough that their presence in normal concentrations is also usually not a problem.

Subjects include human history in relation to the bible, illustrated mythological creatures, and the histories of important Christian and secular cities from antiquity. Finished in 1493 after years in the making, it was originally written in Latin by Hartmann Schedel, and a German version was translated by Georg Alt. It is one of the best-documented early printed books‚Äîan incunabulum‚Äîand one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text. Latin scholars refer to it as Liber Chronicarum (Book of Chronicles) as this phrase appears in the index introduction of the Latin edition. English-speakers have long referred to it as the Nuremberg Chronicle after the city in which it was published. German-speakers refer to it as Die Schedelsche Weltchronik (Schedel's World History) in honor of its author. Production Two Nuremberg merchants, Sebald Schreyer (1446‚Äì1503) and his son-in-law, Sebastian Kammermeister (1446‚Äì1520), commissioned the Latin version of the chronicle. They also commissioned George Alt (1450‚Äì1510), a scribe at the Nuremberg treasury, to translate the work into German. Both Latin and German editions were printed by Anton Koberger, in Nuremberg.Cambridge Digital Library, University of Cambridge, http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-INC-00000-A-00007-00002-00888/1 Contracts were recorded by scribes, bound into volumes, and deposited in the Nuremberg City Archives.WIlson, Adrian. The Making of the Nuremberg Chronicle. Amsterdam: A. Asher & Co. 1976 The first contract from December, 1491, established the relationship between the illustrators and the patrons. The painters, Wolgemut and Pleydenwurff, were to provide the layout of the chronicle, to oversee the production of the woodcuts, and to guard the designs against piracy. The patrons agreed to advance 1000 gulden for paper, printing costs, and the distribution and sale of the book. A second contract, between the patrons and the printer, was executed in March 1492. It stipulated conditions for acquiring the paper and managing the printing. The blocks and the archetype were to be returned to the patrons once the printing was completed.Landau, David and Peter Parshall. The Renaissance Print, 1470‚Äì1550. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994 A typical opening, uncoloured The author of the text, Hartmann Schedel, was a medical doctor, humanist and book collector. He earned a doctorate in medicine in Padua in 1466, then settled in Nuremberg to practice medicine and collect books. According to an inventory done in 1498, Schedel's personal library contained 370 manuscripts and 670 printed books. The author used passages from the classical and medieval works in this collection to compose the text of Chronicle. He borrowed most frequently from another humanist chronicle, Supplementum Chronicarum, by Giacomo Filippo Foresti of Bergamo. It has been estimated that about 90% of the text is pieced together from works on humanities, science, philosophy, and theology, while about 10% of the chronicle is Schedel's original composition.\\"About this book - Author\\" , Beloit College Morse Library, 2003 Nuremberg was one of the largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1490s, with a population of between 45,000 and 50,000. Thirty-five patrician families composed the City Council. The Council controlled all aspects of printing and craft activities, including the size of each profession and the quality, quantity and type of goods produced. Although dominated by a conservative aristocracy, Nuremberg was a center of northern humanism. Anton Koberger, printer of the Nuremberg Chronicle, printed the first humanist book in Nuremberg in 1472. Sebald Shreyer, one of the patrons of the chronicle, commissioned paintings from classical mythology for the grand salon of his house. Hartmann Schedel, author of the chronicle, was an avid collector of both Italian Renaissance and German humanist works. Hieronymus M√ºnzer, who assisted Schedel in writing the chronicle's chapter on geography, was among this group, as were Albrecht D√ºrer and Johann and Willibald Pirckheimer. Publication Catching a \\"lion fish\\" - a small illustration from a Latin copy. Note the red capital done in pen and ink, and the doodle in the margin below The Chronicle was first published in Latin on July 12, 1493 in the city of Nuremberg. This was quickly followed by a German translation on December 23 1493. An estimated 1400 to 1500 Latin and 700 to 1000 German copies were published. A document from 1509 records that 539 Latin versions and 60 German versions had not been sold. Approximately 400 Latin and 300 German copies survived into the twenty-first century.\\"About this book - Latin and German Editions\\" , Beloit College Morse Library They are scattered around the world in museums and collections. The larger illustrations were also sold separately as prints, often hand-colored in watercolor. Many copies of the book are colored, with varying degrees of skill; there were specialist shops for this. The coloring on some examples have been added much later, and some copies have been broken up for sale as decorative prints. The publisher and printer was Anton Koberger, the godfather of Albrecht D√ºrer, who in the year of D√ºrer's birth in 1471 ceased goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning 24 printing presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad, from Lyon to Buda.Giulia Bartrum, Albrecht D√ºrer and his Legacy, British Museum Press, 2002, pp. 94-96, Contents The Fifth day of creation The chronicle is an illustrated world history, in which the contents are divided into seven ages: * First age: from creation to the Deluge * Second age: up to the birth of Abraham * Third age: up to King David * Fourth age: up to the Babylonian captivity * Fifth age: up to the birth of Jesus Christ * Sixth age: up to the present time (the largest part) * Seventh age: outlook on the end of the world and the Last Judgment Illustrations Page depicting Constantinople with added hand-colouring The large workshop of Michael Wolgemut, Nuremberg's leading artist in various media, provided the unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (before duplications are eliminated; see below). Sebastian Kammermeister and Sebald Schreyer financed the printing in a contract dated March 16, 1492, although preparations had been well under way for several years. Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff were first commissioned to provide the illustrations in 1487-88, and a further contract of December 29, 1491, commissioned manuscript layouts of the text and illustrations. Albrecht D√ºrer was an apprentice with Wolgemut from 1486 to 1489, so may well have participated in designing some of the illustrations for the specialist craftsmen (called \\"formschneiders\\") who cut the blocks, onto which the design had been drawn, or a drawing glued. From 1490 to 1494 D√ºrer was traveling. A drawing by Wolgemut for the elaborate frontispiece, dated 1490, is in the British Museum. While some art experts may claim to be able to identify which Nuremberg Chronicle woodcuts may be attributed to D√ºrer, there is no consensus. D√ºrer was not yet using his monogram, and no artists in Wolgemut's studio signed their work in the Chronicle. Illustrations depicted many never before illustrated major cities in Europe and the Near East. 645 original woodcuts were used for the illustrations. As with other books of the period, many of the woodcuts, showing towns, battles or kings were used more than once in the book, with just the text labels changed. The book is large at 18 inches by 12 inches. Only the city of Nuremberg is given a double-page illustration with no text measuring about 342 x 500mm.. The illustration for the city of Venice is adapted from a much larger woodcut of 1486 by Erhard Reuwich in the first illustrated printed travel book, the Sanctae Perigrinationes of 1486. This and other sources were used where possible; where no information was available a number of stock images were used and reused up to eleven times.

Colored woodcut town view of Florence Pirated Editions Due to the success and prestige of the Nuremberg Chronicle, which had one of the largest print-runs of an edition during the incunabula (also known as the incunable period of book production circa 1455-1500), one of the first large- scale pirated editions of the Chronicle appeared on the market. The culprit was Johann Sch√∂nsperger (c. 1455-1521), a printer working out of Augsburg who produced smaller editions of the Chronicle in 1496, 1497, and 1500 in German, Latin and a second edition also in German. It was the beginning of unauthorized book editions; pirated editions which capitalized on the success of another author and printer/publisher without consent. Pirating is a problem which continues presently within book publishing. Despite the pirating of a successful book, Sch√∂nsperger went bankrupt in 1507.

G. Wodehouse. Owned by the doting Lord Emsworth, the Empress is an enormous black Berkshire sow, who wins many prizes in the \\"Fat Pigs\\" class at the local Shropshire Agricultural Show, and is the subject of many plots and schemes, generally involving her kidnap for various purposes. In 2005 Hall & Woodhouse, the Dorset-based Brewers of Badger beer, named a public house in Hampshire in honour of the Empress.  Appearances  Once the pig bug has taken hold of her master, the Empress becomes a regular feature in the Blandings books, playing some part in most of the subsequent stories: * \\"Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey\\" (1927, included in Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, 1935) * Summer Lightning (1929) * Heavy Weather (1933) * Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939) * Full Moon (1947) * Pigs Have Wings (1952) * Service With a Smile (1961) * Galahad at Blandings (1965) * A Pelican at Blandings (1969) * Sunset at Blandings (1977)  Keepers  In the course of the Blandings saga, the Empress is tended to by a large and disparate bunch of pig-keepers, most of them rather unappealing types who, unsurprisingly, smell strongly of pig. * George Cyril Wellbeloved, her first and best-known keeper, is a rather unreliable sort, a little too fond of drink and lacking the old feudal loyalty; he defects to the rival camp of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe for a time, later returning to Blandings (in Service With a Smile), only to further betray Emsworth by joining yet another plot to kidnap the Empress. * Pirbright, who holds the post throughout Summer Lightning and Heavy Weather, is a taciturn man does the job in a solid manner, and enjoys a good scrap with would-be pig-nappers. * Edwin Pott is an elderly, gnome-like man with no roof to his mouth (rendering his speech rather hard to follow), who appears in Full Moon. * Monica Simmons, rather worryingly niece to Parsloe-Parsloe, is nevertheless a highly capable girl despite referring to the Empress as a \\"piggy-wiggy\\". Graduate of an Agricultural College, Amazonian Miss Simmons tends her charge well in Pigs Have Wings, and returns to the post in Galahad at Blandings, only to elope at the end with a nephew of Lord Emsworth. * Cuthbert Price, who takes over from Simmons, for A Pelican at Blandings.  Adventures  \\"Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey\\", wherein we first meet the noble beast, tells of how she misses her first keeper, Wellbeloved, when he is sent to jail for a spell; her pining is worrisome to her master, with the big show approaching, until she is pepped up by James Belford's hog-calling techniques, returning to her trough with enough gusto to take her first Silver Medal. Soon afterwards, to Emsworth's disgust, Wellbeloved defects to Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, whose own animal the Pride of Matchingham is the Empress' biggest rival. In the novels Summer Lightning and Heavy Weather, while she is under the care of Pirbright, she becomes the subject of various schemes: first stolen by Ronnie Fish (who has upset his uncle by bouncing a tennis ball on her back and hopes to get back into his good books by \\"finding\\" her again), she is stashed in a gamekeeper's cottage in the woods, and fed by the admirable Beach, but later moved by Hugo Carmody to a caravan owned by Rupert Baxter. In Heavy Weather, she finds Galahad Threepwood's notorious memoirs, hidden in her custom-built new sty by Percy Pilbeam, and eats the whole book, and not long afterward finds herself in the dicky of Ronnie Fish's car, as he threatens to run off with her if her master refuses to fund Fish's elopement. Throughout this, both Emsworth and Gally suspect Parsloe-Parsloe of being behind all the foul play. In Uncle Fred in the Springtime, she is once again taken captive, and hidden in a bathroom by the Duke of Dunstable, but flees when Lord Bosham lets off a shutgun in her vicinity. In Full Moon, Bill Lister is twice hired to paint her portrait, and she is put in Veronica Wedge's bedroom for a time by Gally, while in Pigs Have Wings she spends some time at Matchingham Hall, home of Parsloe-Parsloe, having been stolen by the turncoat Wellbeloved in response to Gally's cunning theft of Parsloe's new pig, the Queen of Matchingham. Her subsequent rescue leaves her plenty of time to return to form, before her triumphant third Silver Medal. In Service With a Smile, a Church Lad teases her with a potato on a piece of string, and Dunstable once again schemes to take her away from Lord Emsworth, planning to sell her to Lord Tilbury, but the plot (involving Lavender Briggs and Wellbeloved) is blocked by the dashing Uncle Fred. In Galahad at Blandings, dastardly Huxley Winkworth, feeling she is overweight, plots to release her and give her some exercise. When he finally gets past Monica Simmons' able guard, he finds the Empress suffering from a hangover, Wilfred Allsop having dropped a flask of whisky into her trough the day before; she bites his finger, and Emsworth's fears that she may be in danger of infection prove priceless to his own happiness.

The Zelter entry takes up parts of pages 593-595 of Volume V. was a German composer, conductor and teacher of music. Working in his father's bricklaying business, Zelter attained mastership in that profession, and was a musical autodidact. Zelter was born and died in Berlin. He became friendly with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and his works include settings of Goethe's poems. During his career, he composed about two hundred lieder, as well as cantatas, a viola concerto (performed as early as 1779)Greene 1985, p. 418 and piano music. Amongst Zelter's pupils (at different times) were Felix Mendelssohn,Garratt 2002, p. 92 and elsewhere Fanny Mendelssohn,Tillard 1996, p. 54 et seq. Giacomo Meyerbeer, Eduard Grell, Otto Nicolai, Johann Friedrich Naue, and Heinrich Dorn. Felix Mendelssohn was perhaps Zelter's favorite pupil and Zelter wrote to Goethe boasting of the 12-year old's abilities. Zelter communicated his strong love of the music of J. S. Bach to Mendelssohn, one consequence of which was Mendelssohn's 1829 revival of Bach's St Matthew Passion at the Sing-Akademie under Zelter's auspices. This epochal event sparked a general re-evaluation and revival of Bach's works, which were then largely forgotten and regarded as old-fashioned and beyond resuscitation. Mendelssohn had hoped to succeed Zelter on the latter's death as leader of the Singakademie, but the post went instead to Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. Postage stamp (1952) from the series Men from Berlin's Past Zelter was married to Julie Pappritz in 1796, one year after his first wife, Sophie Eleonora Fl√∂ricke, n√©e Kappel, had died. Pappritz was a well-known singer at the Berlin Opera. Zelter is buried at the Sophienkirche in Berlin. The violinist Daniel Hope (born 1973) is a direct descendant of Zelter. Zelter was the author of a biography of Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch, first published in 1801 by J.F. Unger in Berlin. External links * NotesReferences *Garratt, James (2002). .

The Band's recording also fared well in Canada and the UK ‚Äì in those countries, the single was a top 40 hit, peaking at No. 35 in Canada and No. 21 in the UK in 1968. The song had three cover releases in 1968 and 1969 with arrangements that appealed to a diversity of music audiences. Aretha Franklin's 1969 soul music arrangement was included in her This Girl's in Love with You album, which peaked in the U.S. at No. 19 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the soul chart and also peaked in Canada at No. 12. Jackie DeShannon's 1968 pop arrangement, debuting on the Hot 100 one week before The Band's, peaked at No. 55 in the US and No. 35 in Canada. A joint single rhythm and blues arrangement released by Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations in 1969, hit No. 46 in the US, and No. 36 in Canada. The Band's and Jackie DeShannon's versions never mentioned the title. The Band's version credits the group's individual members ‚Äî Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm‚Äîon the record label, rather than The Band as a single entity. The group had signed to Capitol as The Krackers and the name 'The Band' had yet to be arrived at when Music from Big Pink was issued. The group wasn't identified as \\"The Band\\" until their second album. Composition=Inspiration and influences The inspiration for and influences affecting the composition of \\"The Weight\\" came from the music of the American South, the life experiences of band members, particularly Levon Helm, and movies of filmmakers Ingmar Bergman and Luis Bu√±uel. There are also hints of influences involving drug deals and the band's relationship with known drug dealer Cathy Smith. The original members of The Band performed \\"The Weight\\" as an American Southern folk song with country music (vocals, guitars and drums) and gospel music (piano and organ) elements. The lyrics, written in the first-person, are about a traveler's experiences arriving, visiting, and departing a town called Nazareth. According to Robertson, this is based on Nazareth, Pennsylvania, because it was the home of Martin Guitars. He wrote the guitar parts on a 1951 Martin D-28. The singers, led by Helm, vocalize the traveler's encounters with people in the town from the perspective of a Bible Belt American Southerner, like Helm himself, a native of rural Arkansas. The colorful characters in \\"The Weight\\" were based on real people members of The Band knew, as Levon Helm explained in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire. In particular, \\"young Anna Lee\\" mentioned in the third verse is Helm's longtime friend Anna Lee Amsden, and, according to her, \\"Carmen\\" was from Helm's hometown, Turkey Scratch, Arkansas. \\"Crazy Chester\\" was an eccentric resident of Fayetteville, Arkansas, who carried a cap gun. Ronnie Hawkins would tell him to \\"keep the peace\\" at his Rockwood Club when Chester arrived. According to Robertson, \\"The Weight\\" was inspired by the movies of Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel. Bu√±uel's films are known for their surreal imagery and criticism of organized religion, particularly Catholicism. The song's lyrics and music invoke vivid imagery, the main character's perspective is influenced by the Bible, and the episodic story was inspired by the predicaments Bu√±uel's film characters faced that undermined their goals for maintaining or improving their moral character. Of this, Robertson once stated: > (Bu√±uel) did so many films on the impossibility of sainthood. People trying > to be good in Viridiana and Nazar√≠n, people trying to do their thing. In > \\"The Weight\\" it's the same thing. People like Bu√±uel would make films that > had these religious connotations to them but it wasn't necessarily a > religious meaning. In Bu√±uel there were these people trying to be good and > it's impossible to be good. In \\"The Weight\\" it was this very simple thing. > Someone says, \\"Listen, would you do me this favour? When you get there will > you say 'hello' to somebody or will you give somebody this or will you pick > up one of these for me? Oh? You're going to Nazareth, that's where the > Martin guitar factory is. Do me a favour when you're there.\\" This is what > it's all about. So the guy goes and one thing leads to another and it's like > \\"Holy shit, what's this turned into? I've only come here to say 'hello' for > somebody and I've got myself in this incredible predicament.\\" It was very > Bu√±uelish to me at the time. This is also related in Robertson's 2016 autobiography, Testimony. Notable performances of \\"The Weight\\" by The Band The Band's performance of \\"The Weight\\" in the 1968 studio recording included * Levon Helm ‚Äì lead and harmony vocals, drums * Rick Danko ‚Äì lead (fourth verse) and harmony vocals, bass guitar * Richard Manuel ‚Äì Lowrey organ (cut), harmony vocals * Garth Hudson ‚Äì piano * Robbie Robertson ‚Äì acoustic guitar The official recording credits on the single belong to the above names, in that order, not to The Band per se. In 2005, a remix of the song with Richard Manuel's organ restored was released as a download-only bonus track for the iTunes Music Store version of A Musical History. An edited version of the studio recording was included in the popular American counterculture film Easy Rider, which was released in July 1969. \\"The Weight\\" played while the protagonists, hippie motorcyclists, enjoyed a ride through Monument Valley. The version on the soundtrack album is performed by Smith due to a failure to negotiate the rights to the original recording. On August 17, 1969, The Band performed \\"The Weight\\" as the tenth song in their set at Woodstock. The Woodstock arrangement was more elaborate than the comparatively elemental and spare studio recording. , it retained Robertson's simple folk guitar introduction, but Helm's slow studio performance drum bangs were replaced by a short drum roll that provided the feel of a faster tempo though the actual tempo was the same as the studio performance. Manuel's Lowrey organ, which was mixed out of the studio recording, was prominent; and Robertson participated vocally in the choruses. In the 1970s, \\"The Weight\\" appeared on three live albums by The Band, Rock of Ages, Before the Flood, and The Last Waltz. Just after their November 25, 1976, \\"farewell concert,\\" The Band performed a gospel arrangement of \\"The Weight\\" with The Staple Singers that was filmed for The Last Waltz. Mavis and Pops Staples sang second and third verse lead vocals, respectively, and Robertson performed with an electric guitar. This performance of \\"The Weight\\" was included on the 1978 soundtrack album from the film. The Band's performance of the song during the concert itself was later included in a 2002 extended re-release of the soundtrack album. In 1989, when The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, \\"The Weight\\" was performed by Garth Hudson, Rick Danko, and Robbie Robertson, with Blue Rodeo accompanying. Songwriting credit dispute The songwriting credit to Robbie Robertson for \\"The Weight\\", like credit for many of the songs performed by The Band, was disputed years later by Levon Helm. Helm insisted that the composition of the lyrics and the music was collaborative, declaring that each band member made a substantial contribution. In an interview, Helm credited Robertson with 60 percent of the lyrics, Danko and Manuel with 20 percent each of the lyrics, much of the music credit to Garth Hudson, and a small credit to himself for lyrics. Other versions \\"The Weight\\" has become a modern standard, and hence has been performed by many artists, including Little Feat, the Chambers Brothers, Eric Church, Chris Stapleton, Stoney LaRue, The Staple Singers, Waylon Jennings, Joe Cocker, Travis, Grateful Dead, Blues Traveler, New Riders of the Purple Sage, O.A.R., Edwin McCain, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Black Crowes, Spooky Tooth, Hanson, Old Crow Medicine Show, Panic! at the Disco, Shannon Curfman, Aretha Franklin, Joan Osborne, John Denver, Trampled by Turtles, Cassandra Wilson, Miranda Lambert, Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield, Deana Carter, New Madrid, Dionne Warwick and Gillian Welch. Mumford & Sons, RatDog and Bob Weir are also known to cover this song from time to time. Additional notable versions are by Zac Brown Band, Hoyt Axton, Lee Ann Womack, Smith, Weezer, the Allman Brothers Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Free Wild, Brian Fallon and Aaron Pritchett. As a recording session guitarist, Duane Allman played lead slide guitar on Aretha Franklin's and King Curtis's versions of the song. These are included on Allman's An Anthology (1972) and An Anthology Volume II (1974) respectively. Jackie DeShannon's cover of the song for Imperial Records in 1968 reached #55 on the U.S. Pop chart, and #35 in Canada. The song was recorded by Diana Ross and The Supremes with The Temptations in 1969 for their album Together on Motown Records. Country artist Sammi Smith included a cover of the song on her 1971 album Lonesome. Folk singer Michelle Shocked covers the song as part of her 2007 gospel album ToHeavenURide. Charly Garc√≠a covered the song in Spanish under the title \\"El Peso,\\" and Czech singer Marie Rottrov√° covered the song with the band Flamingo in 1970. Jeff Healey covered it on his album Mess of Blues in 2008. Jensen Ackles also covered a portion of the song along with Jason Manns in 2010. Conan O'Brien performed the song as an encore during his The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. In 1993, Australians Jimmy Barnes and The Badloves covered \\"The Weight\\" and released it as the fourth single from Barnes' seventh studio album album Flesh and Wood. It peaked at number six on the Australian ARIA Charts. Aaron Weiss is known to perform the song during acoustic sets following performances of his band mewithoutYou. The Black Keys performed the song at Coachella 2012, with John Fogerty as a special guest, in honor of Levon Helm, who had died the day before. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, who were honoring a fan's sign request, performed \\"The Weight\\" at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on May 2, 2012, as a tribute to Levon Helm, who had died two weeks before. It was the first time the band had ever performed the song. Springsteen called Helm \\"one of the greatest, greatest voices in country, rockabilly and rock 'n' roll ... staggering ... while playing the drums. Both his voice and his drumming were so incredibly versatile. He had a feel on the drums that comes out of certain place in the past and you can't replicate it.\\" Springsteen also joked that when he was auditioning drummer Max Weinberg he made him sing. Panic! at the Disco performed \\"The Weight\\" for a television special on April 17, 2008. A rendition of \\"The Weight\\" was performed at the 55th Grammy Awards by various artists including Elton John, Zac Brown, Mumford & Sons, Mavis Staples, and Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes as a tribute to Levon Helm and other deceased artists. \\"The Weight\\" was traditionally the last song played during the Midnight Rambles in Levon Helm's barn in Woodstock, New York, often including the guest musicians for the evening's festivities. Some of the musicians who played with Levon Helm in the re-formed Band or the Levon Helm Band, including guitarist Jim Weider, bassist Byron Isaacs and drummer Randy Ciarlante, have formed a group called \\"The Weight\\" which performs a complete set of Band material. Garth Brooks covered \\"The Weight\\" on his 2013 compilation boxed set Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. \\"The Weight\\" is a frequent cover, and inspiration for, The Weight Band, featuring former Band member Jim Weider, and past members of the Levon Helm Band and Rick Danko Group. Recently, The Weight Band performed \\"The Weight\\" on a nationally broadcast PBS special, Infinity Hall Live. \\"The Weight\\" was performed by Jimmy Fallon and The Muppets in the closing moments of the final episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on February 7, 2014. The performance (which mirrored the arrangement and staging of the Band's performance of the song with the Staple Singers in The Last Waltz) featured several notable Muppet characters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem, and ended with Fallon walking out of the Late Night studio, down the hall, and into the new studio of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. After Levon Helm's death, Graham Nash and Shane Fontayne wrote a song in tribute to him, entitled \\"Back Home.\\" The refrain from \\"The Weight\\" (\\"take a load off Fannie, ...\\") is included as a coda. The song has since become a staple of Nash's public performances, including those of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Rickie Lee Jones recorded \\"The Weight\\" for her 2012 album The Devil You Know. A 50th anniversary version was recorded featuring Robbie Robertson playing a Fender Stratocaster guitar, Ringo Starr playing drums, and incorporating various musicians and vocalists performing in the USA, Italy, Japan, the D. R. Congo, Bahrain, Spain, Argentina, Nepal, and Jamaica. It has been released on the Playing For Changehttps://www.youtube.com/c/playingchange/about YouTube channel.

History  Caldera Thin Clients, Inc., had been created as a subsidiary of Caldera, Inc., on 2 September 1998. Caldera Thin Clients' original President and CEO was Roger Alan Gross, who resigned in January 1999. In April 1999, Caldera Thin Clients released the no longer needed sources to GEM and ViewMAX under the GNU General Public License (GPL). In July 1999, Caldera Thin Clients decided on a major refocus on Linux and concequently changed its name to Lineo. Lineo licensed a stripped down OpenLinux distribution from Caldera Systems and named it Embedix. They continued to maintain the former Caldera Thin Clients sales office in Taipei in 1999. In January 2000, Lineo reincorporated in Delaware. Lineo's technologies fully owned were well ahead of competitors' products in the embedded system portion. These technologies included: * Rt-Control provided ŒºClinux - a version of Linux for microcontrollers, such as the Motorola 68k/ColdFire line, i960, ARM7, and ETRAX CRIS chips. With these chips lacking MMU and thus unable to provide multi-tasking capabilities, uClinux was able to run full-featured in as little as 150 KB of RAM with a 1 MB ROM chip. * FirePlug - Linux-based projects, such as their Linux firewall built on the ThinLinux product, which ran in as little as 2 MB of disk/flash storage and 8 MB RAM. * Embedix - Lineo's flagship product that ran a complete multitasking, networked Linux operating system in 2 MB of ROM/flash and 4 MB of RAM. * Embedix SDK and the Embrowser - a fully graphical internet browser for embedded systems. Embrowser was Lineo's port of the 32-bit Extended DOS-based browser DR-WebSpyder, originally based on the Arachne browser. This combination of technologies allowed Caldera Thin Clients to offer a full Linux operating system with a graphical browser that could run off a floppy disk. More importantly the product was unique, and this came from the fact that Lineo's view on the Linux embedded market was different from other vendors. All the other vendors believed that Linux was heavily fragmented and that the solution was to offer Linux features for real time OSes, that is a Linux API for some other OSes. Red Hat with its EL/IX created a kernel independent framework (API) which allowed some Linux software to run on the eCos kernel. Lineo did not agree with this assessment and believed the API offered far more advantages and allowed for a fully hardened system, that is, Lineo utilized a custom Linux kernel. Through the six companies Lineo acquired, they were able to extend the same Linux technology across multiple chip architectures and add real-time capabilities. The acquisitions gave broader Linux support, from very small microcontrollers, through traditional platforms like x86, and up to high end, high availability systems. Lineo's president and CEO, when it reformed under the new name, became Bryan Wayne Sparks, who also had been one of the original founders of Caldera, Inc., in 1994. At the time of its creation, Lineo had 14 employees. Lineo's main product was Embedix, a lightweight Linux distribution for embedded systems, licensed from Caldera Systems, Inc., another subsidiary of Caldera, Inc. Another product was DR-DOS, a DOS‚Äìcompatible operating system, previously developed by Caldera UK Ltd. between 1996 and 1999 and originally acquired from Novell by Caldera, Inc., on 23 July 1996. Through its acquisitions Lineo also had a range of products in many different product categories. Through a series of acquisitions and mergers, Lineo eventually ballooned to a peak of about 350 employees, with offices in seven countries. The companies that it acquired or merged with were: * Zentropix ‚Äì realtime Linux specialists * Rt-Control Inc. ‚Äì uClinux creators, very small board (uCdimm) vendors * Moreton Bay ‚Äì VPN/Router vendor (located in Brisbane, Australia) * United Systems Engineering (USE) ‚Äì Japanese Linux consulting company * Fireplug ‚Äì Canadian Linux consulting company (ThinLinux product) * Inup ‚Äì High availability Linux * Embedded Power Corporation ‚Äì Realtime and DSP OS (RTXC product)  Decline  In October 2001, Lineo refreshed and expanded a free license for the redistribution and modification of original Digital Research binaries and sources related to CP/M and MP/M through \\"The Unofficial CP/M Web site\\" a license originally issued by Caldera in 1997. After some assets were auctioned off in April 2002, by July 2002 the company had reformed as Embedix, Inc. under the lead of Matthew R. Harris, formerly a Summit Law attorney for Caldera, Inc. However, Embedix, Inc. was short-lived and ceased to exist later that year, when the Embedix division was purchased and absorbed by Motorola's Metrowerks. The remaining Digital Research assets fell back to the investor Canopy Group, and parts of the DR-DOS sources were acquired by DeviceLogics in 2002\\\\. Parts of the embedded modules and uClinux software assets (formerly Rt-Control Inc.) were acquired by Arcturus Networks Inc. in 2002. The router division (formerly Moreton Bay) spun out as SnapGear, and was later acquired by CyberGuard and then Secure Computing, and Secure Computing was acquired by McAfee and as of 2008 was still producing the SnapGear brand of VPN/routers. Lineo Japan, a former Japanese acquisition and at one time wholly owned subsidiary, United System Engineers, Inc. (USE), now trades as Lineo Solutions.

Born in Cairo, Gazbia Sirry studied fine arts and became a professor in the painting department of the Faculty of Art Education, Helwan University. She was also a professor at the American University in Cairo. She has had more than 50 personal exhibitions, official purchases by international museums, international prizes, scholarships and university chairs. Her dissertation traces Egypt's politic history. The paintings of Sirry capture the relationship between feminist consciousness and advocacy of women, history, fascism, and Islamic futurism. Because of their eclecticism and heterogeneity of modern Egypt, Sirry's paintings were known. Her work is dominated by women in unmistakable pose of power stemming from female unity, performing roles in the public and private spheres. Her earlier work deals with polygamy and strengthening the fertility and reproductive power of women. In the late 1950s, Sirry made stylistic and thematic changes to reflect the grim mood created by discontent with the crackdown on dissent and curtailment of political freedom across the country. Through her work in the mid 1960s, when it becomes highly abstract, these dramatic changes are apparent. The full abstraction was replaced in the early 1970s by the reappearance of human forms, but the dark paintings represent the fears of Sirry about the fortunes of women's emancipation. The dominant bright colors and pyramidal shapes of her paintings show the national pride and enthusiasm following the Ramadan/Yom Kippur War of 1973 in the later part of the 1970s.

Family Nagwa was born as Awatef Mohamed Agami, in Alexandria to a middle-class Egyptian family from Agami region. She then changed her Egyptian folk name (Awatef) to a more artistic sounding one. Career She began belly dancing in the early 1960s. In 1976, the composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab wrote an entire musical piece exclusively for her belly dancing show titled \\"Amar Arbatashar\\" (a popular Egyptian slang term meaning the \\"full Moon of the 14th (day)\\"), it was her transition from traditional oriental dance to a choreographed stage performances. After Fouad's marriage to Ahmed Fouad Hassan, the prominent Egyptian violin player, composer and conductor, she danced in the stage show Adwoua El-Madina (City Lights), which had featured such performers as Abdel Halim Hafez, Fayza Ahmed, Shadia and Sabah. Fouad featured on many of the covers of the Ahmed Fouad Hassan's albums. Fouad says: \\"Hassan nurtured my amateur's talents... He taught me the importance of studying and working on my talent if I wanted to be a big star.\\" She also trained some Western dances at the Nelly Mazloum Dance School and joined the National Dance Troupe to study Western folklore with Russian teachers. Nagwa Fouad learned showmanship and eye-catching techniques that she used in her performances of \\"Ayoub El-Masri\\" (\\"Ayoub, The Egyptian\\") and \\"Bahiya wa Yassin\\". In 1976, composer Mohamed Abdel-Wahab wrote \\"Qamar Arbaa-tashar\\" (Blue Moon or 14th moon) for her. Her stage performance to this piece allowed her to change the way belly-dancing was presented on stage, transforming it from traditional oriental dance to more of a choreographed lavish spectacle, adding more dramatic elements to it than ever before. The composition served as a transition for Fouad: \\"I was able to combine the oriental dancing of Tahiya Karioka and Samia Gamal with Na'ema's acrobatic style and created a stage show like a dramatic piece\\" she says. Fouad offered original stage shows in five star hotels and productions for television for many years, not only in raqs sharqi, but also using inspiration from raqs sha'biyya (noted as folklore, or 'baladi') sometimes with folk singer, Fatma Serhan, and often with chorus ensembles of other dancers. Fouad established her own dance group, but it did not last long; she later tried to retire from dancing to become actress. She played on the stage and in the cinema and finally became a cinema producer.  Famous performances  * 1976 Qamar Arba'tashar (Moon of the 14th).

Biography Born in the small Egyptian town of Wana in 1922 February, Samia's family moved just months later to Cairo and settled near the Khan El-Khalili bazaar. It was many years later that Samia Gamal met Badia Masabni, the owner of a big Cairo nightclub back then. Badia offered Samia an invitation to join her dance company, which Samia accepted. Badia Masabni gave her the stage name Samia Gamal, and she began her dance career. Samia Gamal and Farid Al-Attrach in the Egyptian film Afrita hanem (Genie Lady) (1949) At first, she studied under Badia and Badia's star dancer at the time, Tahiya Karioka. However she soon became a respected soloist and brought forth her own style. Samia Gamal incorporated techniques from ballet and Latin dance into her solo performances. She was also the first to perform with high-heeled shoes on stage. She starred in dozens of Egyptian films next to the famous Farid Al Attrach. They could be thought of as the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of the Middle East. They not only played each other's love interest on the silver screen but also in real life. However, their love was not meant to be. Because of Farid's social position, he refused to marry Samia. Farid believed that marriage kills artist talent, he never married. Some claim that Farid as a Druze prince, told her it would bring too much shame to his family for him to marry a belly dancer; but the claim is baseless. Farid helped placing Samia on the National Stage by risking all he owned, and managed to borrow to produce a film (Habib al omr) co-starring with her in 1947. In 1949, Egypt's King Farouk proclaimed Samia Gamal \\"The National Dancer of Egypt\\", which brought US attention to the dancer. In 1950, Samia came to the US and was photographed by Gjon Mili. She also performed in the Latin Quarter, New York's trendy nightclub. She later married the so-called \\"Texas millionaire\\" Shepherd King III, whom, it was later reported only had about $50,000. However, their marriage did not last long. In 1958, Samia Gamal married Roshdy Abaza, one of the most famous Egyptian actors with whom Samia starred in a number of films. Samia Gamal stopped dancing in 1972 when she was nearly in her 50s but began again after given advice by Samir Sabri. She then danced until the early 1980s. Samia Gamal died on 1 December 1994, at 70 years of age in Cairo. Samia's charismatic performances in Egyptian and international films gave Egypt's Oriental Dance recognition and admiration in Egypt and worldwide. Tribute On March 5, 2017, Google dedicated a Doodle to the actress for the 93rd anniversary of her birth. The Doodle reached all the countries of the Arab World.

O. Miller\\" and \\"Anthony Brooks\\". The film was produced in 1960 and theatrically released in 1961. Nude on the Moon is the second of eight nudist films produced and directed by Wishman. While most nudist films of the time were set within a conventional nudist camp, apparently as a promotional gimmick Wishman decided to set the story in a nudist civilization on the Moon. Plot Scientist Dr. Jeff Huntley inherits a fortune from his uncle and invests it in the development of a rocket ship, built with the assistance of his mentor, Dr. Nichols. After landing on the Moon, the pair discover a civilization of topless extraterrestrials led by a Moon Queen with telepathic powers. Enamored of Dr. Huntley, the Moon Queen allows the men to take photos of the nudists during their everyday activities. Their oxygen running low, the two are forced to return to Earth, realizing in the process that they've left their camera behind and have no proof of the aliens' existence. Jeff is dispirited to learn that nobody believes their trip succeeded, but his spirits are lifted when he sees the resemblance between Dr. Nichols's secretary, Cathy, and the Moon Queen. The movie ends as the two embrace, signaling the beginning of a new romance. Soundtrack Nude on the Moon features the original song \\"I'm Mooning Over You (My Little Moon Doll)\\" sung by Ralph Young (who also plays a principal role in Wishman's Blaze Starr Goes Nudist under the pseudonym \\"Russ Martine\\"). Young would soon meet Belgian singer Tony Sandler and form Sandler and Young, a successful easy-listening duo, with him. The lyrics and melody were written by Wishman's niece, Judith Kushner. According to Wishman, future Tonight Show bandleader Doc Severinsen arranged the orchestration but is not credited. Production The Moon sequences in the film were shot at Coral Castle in Homestead, Florida. Reception In a review for AllMovie, Fred Beldin wrote, \\"Charming and bubble-headed, Nude on the Moon is a good-natured fantasy for bawdy kitsch lovers.\\" Legacy Nude on the Moon is considered a cult film. References to it in pop culture include: * Nude on the Moon: The B-52's Anthology, a two-disc CD anthology of music by The B-52's, was released on Rhino Records. Lead singer Fred Schneider was a friend of Wishman's in her later years. * \\"Nude on the Moon,\\" a 1996 single by electronica duo Tipsy, also appears on the album Trip Tease.

He graduated from Nowodworek College in Krak√≥w and Krak√≥w Academy, then traveled and studied in Western Europe. After returning to Poland in 1648 he fought against the Cossacks and Tatars at the Siege of Zbara≈º and at the Battle of Beresteczko. He was taken captive by Tatars in 1652 and then killed by Cossacks. Childhood and studies Sobieski was the oldest child of Jakub Sobieski and his second wife Teofila Zofia Dani≈Ç≈Çowicz. He was born on 24 May 1628 in Z≈Çocz√≥w and spent his childhood in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew. He grew up in a patriotic family, and his mother often took him and his brother to the grave of her grandfather Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, Grand Hetman of the Crown, who was killed in the battle of Cecora in 1620. Zofia Teofila Dani≈Ç≈Çowicz taught her sons the inscription upon their great-grandfather's grave: \\"O quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori!\\" (How sweet and glorious it is to die for one's homeland!). On 29 October 1639 Sobieski became Starosta of Jawor√≥w. Along with his brother John, beginning in 1640, Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Krak√≥w. On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub Zadzik, bishop of Krak√≥w. The next year, on 2 June 1643, Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV for everything he had done for Nodworski College. Two months earlier, in April 1643, Marek and John Sobieski began studies at Krak√≥w Academy. In 1644 Sobieski became Starosta of Krasnystaw. In 1645 Jakub Sobieski, father of Marek and John, prepared special instructions and a guidebook for his sons, who were about to go abroad. Jakub Sobieski, who was inspired by Roman authors, emphasized learning foreign languages and physical exercises. He wanted to prepare his sons to be politics and diplomats. After completing their studies in 1646, the brothers started to travel around Europe under the tutelage of Sebastian Gawrecki. They departed ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew on 21 February or 25 March 1646\\\\. They visited Berlin, Wittenberg, Leipzig, Halle, Amsterdam and Paris, where they arrived on 9 June 1646. They spent the next 16 months in France. In October 1647 Marek and John Sobieski went to England and subsequently studied mathematics in the Netherlands. The brothers had planned to go to Turkey, but after hearing of the Khmelnytsky uprising they decided to return to Poland. Marek and John Sobieski left Brussels on 24 July 1648. Adulthood After returning to Poland, Sobieski and his brother came to Zamo≈õƒá, which at the time was being besieged by Cossacks. In 1648, 1649 and 1650 Sobieski was elected a member of the parliament (sejm walny) of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In 1649 he was among the electors who voted for John II Casimir as King of Poland. Then, as a head of a chorƒÖgiew husarska (military unit formed by Hussars) of 100 horse, the young starosta joined the army of Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki. Massacre of Polish captives after the battle of Batoh. Sobieski was a member of the Polish defense crew besieged by Cossacks at Zbara≈º from 10 July to 22 August 1649. In 1650 he fought against the Cossacks at Kamieniec Podolski. Marek Sobieski also took part in the Battle of Beresteczko on 28‚Äì30 June 1651. After the Polish victory, due his bravery, he received a saber of Tugay Bey, who had been killed during the battle. In September 1651 he fought at the Battle of Bia≈Ça Cerkiew. When the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars began negotiations, Marek Sobieski was sent to the Cossack camp as a guarantor of safety for the Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who was in the Polish camp. In 1652 Sobieski fought against the Cossacks near Brac≈Çaw and during Bia≈Ça Cerkiew campaign. Marching with Jan Odrzywolski, but without his own hussar banner, Sobieski and his retinue came to the field hetman Kalinowski's camp at Batoh on May 31. Marek Sobieski and Odrzywolski were assigned to command cavalry banners during the subsequent battle, and in that capacity they fought on June 1 and 2. On June 2, during the second day of the Battle of Batoh after the defeat of Polish cavalry in the field before the Polish camp, Sobieski commanded a cavalry group, perhaps containing wounded field hetman Kalinowski, that withdrew to the eastern redoubt in Polish camp, where Cossacks destroyed them after bringing artillery. Following Polish soldier Wespazjan Kochowski's writings Sobieski might have been the last Polish commander defending the Polish camp against the Cossack-Tatar army. Young commander was taken prisoner or surrendered, to be ransomed in a future as it was practice of the day, by the Tatars or Cossacks. After the battle, the Cossacks paid the Tatars for possession of the prisoners, and killed the Polish captives in retaliation for Chmielnicki's defeat at Berestechko. Among the 8,000 massacred Polish soldiers was Marek Sobieski. or the number could have been much higher, up to 15,000 killed in action and massacred. Sobieski's mother returned his body home, and to commemorate her fallen son she founded the Church of the Assumption of Mary in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, which was built between 1653 and 1655. Sobieski was buried there in 1655 on the day the church was consecrated. His brother, King John III Sobieski, commissioned a gravestone by Andreas Schl√ºter made from black marble, which was destroyed after 1945. In 1946 Sobieski's body was taken to the Dominican Holy Trinity Church in Krak√≥w. Legacy Sobieski was portrayed by Henryk Sienkiewicz in With Fire and Sword (1884), Antoni Euzebiusz Balicki in Z ≈ºaka kr√≥l (1936) and Jacek Komuda in novel Bohun (2006).

Techno-progressives argue that technological developments can be profoundly empowering and emancipatory when they are regulated by legitimate democratic and accountable authorities to ensure that their costs, risks and benefits are all fairly shared by the actual stakeholders to those developments. Stance Techno- progressivism maintains that accounts of progress should focus on scientific and technical dimensions, as well as ethical and social ones. For most techno- progressive perspectives, then, the growth of scientific knowledge or the accumulation of technological powers will not represent the achievement of proper progress unless and until it is accompanied by a just distribution of the costs, risks, and benefits of these new knowledges and capacities. At the same time, for most techno-progressive critics and advocates, the achievement of better democracy, greater fairness, less violence, and a wider rights culture are all desirable, but inadequate in themselves to confront the quandaries of contemporary technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by progress in science and technology to support and implement these values. Strong techno-progressive positions include support for the civil right of a person to either maintain or modify his or her own mind and body, on his or her own terms, through informed, consensual recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling biomedical technology. During the November 2014 Transvision Conference, many of the leading transhumanist organizations signed the Technoprogressive Declaration. The Declaration stated the values of technoprogressivism.Technoprogressive Declaration - Transvision 2014, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies Contrasting stance Bioconservatism (a portmanteau word combining \\"biology\\" and \\"conservatism\\") is a stance of hesitancy about technological development especially if it is perceived to threaten a given social order. Strong bioconservative positions include opposition to genetic modification of food crops, the cloning and genetic engineering of livestock and pets, and, most prominently, rejection of the genetic, prosthetic, and cognitive modification of human beings to overcome what are broadly perceived as current human biological and cultural limitations. Bioconservatives range in political perspective from right- leaning religious and cultural conservatives to left-leaning environmentalists and technology critics. What unifies bioconservatives is skepticism about medical and other biotechnological transformations of the living world.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

Typically less sweeping as a critique of technological society than bioluddism, the bioconservative perspective is characterized by its defense of the natural, deployed as a moral category. Although techno-progressivism is the stance which contrasts with bioconservatism in the biopolitical spectrum, both techno-progressivism and bioconservatism, in their more moderate expressions, share an opposition to unsafe, unfair, undemocratic forms of technological development, and both recognize that such developmental modes can facilitate unacceptable recklessness and exploitation, exacerbate injustice and incubate dangerous social discontent.

Each feature is located by either a point (e.g. a signpost) or a line (e.g. a no-passing zone). If a segment of the linear element or route is changed, only those locations on the changed segment need to be updated. Linear referencing is suitable for management of data related to linear features like roads, railways, oil and gas transmission pipelines, power and data transmission lines, and rivers. Motivation A system for identifying the location of pipeline features and characteristics is by measuring distance from the start of the pipeline. An example linear reference address is: Engineering Station 1145 + 86 on pipeline Alpha = 114,586 feet from the start of the pipeline. With a reroute, cumulative stationing might not be the same as engineering stationing, because of the addition of the extra pipeline. Linear referencing systems compute the differences to resolve this dilemma. Linear referencing is one of a family of methods of expressing location. Coordinates such as latitude and longitude are another member of the family, as are landmark references such as \\"5 km south of Ayers Rock.\\" Linear referencing has traditionally been the expression of choice in engineering applications such as road and pipeline maintenance. One can more realistically dispatch a worker to a bridge 12.7 km along a road from a reference point, rather than to a pair of coordinates or a landmark. The road serves as the reference frame, just as the earth serves as the reference frame for latitude and longitude. Benefits Linear referencing can be used to define points along a linear feature with just a small amount of information such as the name of a road and the distance and bearing from a landmark along the road. This information can be communicated concisely via plaintext. For example: \\"State route 4, 20 feet east of mile marker 187.\\" Giving a latitude and longitude coordinate to a work crew is not meaningful unless the coordinate is plotted on a map. Often work crews work in remote areas without wireless connectivity which makes on-line digital maps not practical, and the relatively higher effort of providing offline maps or printed maps is not as economical as simply stating locations as offsets, or ranges of offsets, along a linear feature. Linear referencing systems can also be made to be both very precise and very accurate at a much lower cost than is needed to collect latitude and longitude coordinates with high accuracy, especially when the goal is sub-meter accuracy. This is highly dependent upon the width of the linear feature, its centerline, and the visibility of the landmarks and markers that are used to define linear reference offsets. Often, roads are created by engineers using CAD tools that have no geospatial reference at all, and LRS is the preferred method of defining data for linear features. Limitations Consequently, a major limitation of linear referencing is that specifying points that are not on a linear feature is troublesome and error-prone, though not entirely impossible. Consider for example a ski lodge located 100 meters to the right of the road, traveling north. The linear referencing system can be extended by specifying a lateral offset, but the absolute location (i.e. coordinates) of the lodge cannot be determined unless coordinates are specified for the road; that process is prone to error particularly on curved roads. Another major drawback of linear referencing is that a modification in the alignment of a road (e.g. constructing a bypass around a town) changes the measurements that reference all downstream points. The system requires an extensive network of reference stations, and constant maintenance. In an era of mobile maps and GPS, this maintenance overhead for linear referencing systems challenges its long-term viability. (But see below for US Federal Highway Administration requirement that all State DOTs use LRS.) Nonetheless, travel along a road is a linear experience, and at the very least, linear referencing will continue to have a conversational role. Linear referencing systems are recognized by the US Federal government as a valuable tool for specifying right of way data, and are now actually required for the States. Therefore, it is not likely to see LRS usage decline any time soon. Applications=ARNOLD: US Federal Requirements for Highways The US Federal Highway Administration is pushing states to move closer to standardization of LRS data with the ARNOLD requirement. To wit: \\"On August 7, 2012, FHWA announced that the HPMS is expanding the requirement for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to submit their LRS to include all public roads. This requirement will be referred to as the All Road Network of Linear Referenced Data (ARNOLD)\\" The ARNOLD requirement sets the stage for systems that utilize both LRS and coordinates. Both systems are useful in different contexts, and while using latitude and longitude is becoming very popular due to the availability of practical and affordable devices for capturing and displaying global coordinate data, the use of LRS has widely been adopted for planning, engineering, and maintenance.

Highly rated by Robert E. Lee, he was made a divisional commander under Richard S. Ewell. On the first evening of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1, 1863), Ewell missed his opportunity to attack Cemetery Hill, and Johnson opted against attacking Culp's Hill, for which he had a discretionary order, though he attempted this on the second and third days. Ewell and Johnson are blamed by many for the loss of this decisive battle. Early life Johnson was born on Salisbury Plantation near current-day Midlothian in Chesterfield County, Virginia, but his family soon moved to Kentucky. He attended the United States Military Academy and graduated (after five years of study) in 1838. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry and was promoted to first lieutenant in less than a year. He served in the Seminole Wars in Florida and then in the West. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Johnson distinguished himself for action at Veracruz, Cerro Gordo, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec. He received two brevet promotions, to captain and major, during the war and was awarded a ceremonial sword by the state of Virginia for his bravery. Johnson returned to duty on the Western frontier, serving in the Dakota Territory, California, Kansas, and on the Utah Expedition. Civil War After the outbreak of the Civil War, Johnson resigned his United States Army commission and received the rank of colonel in the 12th Georgia Infantry on July 2, 1861. The 12th Georgia fought in Gen. Robert E. Lee's first campaign in western Virginia, at the Battle of Greenbrier River. He was promoted to brigadier general on December 13, 1861, and received his nickname while commanding six infantry regiments in a battle on Allegheny Mountain. (This brigade-sized force was given the grandiose name \\"Army of the Northwest\\".) Valley Campaign In the winter of 1861‚Äì62, Johnson's army cooperated with Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in the early stages of Jackson's Valley Campaign. While Jackson marched his army into the mountains of the present-day Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia to conduct raids on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, Johnson was tasked with protecting against a Union invasion of the \\"upper,\\" more elevated areas of the Shenandoah Valley near Staunton, Virginia. His Army of the Northwest constructed a series of breastworks and trenches atop Shenandoah Mountain which they named simply Fort Edward Johnson. At the Battle of McDowell, Johnson was severely wounded with a bullet to the ankle, which took a long time to heal. He returned to Richmond for his convalescence and remained there for nearly a year, active in the social scene. Although Johnson was a heavy-set, rough-looking, rude character who was still a bachelor at age 47, he had the reputation of a ladies' man. Due to a wound he received in Mexico, he was afflicted with an eye that winked uncontrollably, causing many women to believe he was flirting with them. He caused enough attention that he rated mentions in the famous diary of Mary Chesnut. Stonewall Division In 1863, following the reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia to compensate for the death of Stonewall Jackson after the Battle of Chancellorsville, Johnson was promoted to major general and given command of the \\"Stonewall Division\\" in Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps. Robert E. Lee had become dissatisfied with the previous commander at the battle and summoned Johnson back from medical leave to take the command. Gettysburg By May 1863, Johnson had recovered enough to lead his division in the Gettysburg Campaign. He still needed a heavy hickory stick to move around on foot (and was known to use it against men he believed were shirking battle) and his men nicknamed him \\"Old Clubby\\". On the way north into Pennsylvania, Johnson defeated Union Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy at the Second Battle of Winchester. Johnson arrived at the Battle of Gettysburg on the evening of the first day, July 1, 1863. In a move that is still controversial, Ewell did not take advantage of Johnson's division and attack Cemetery Hill immediately that evening, when it might have been decisive. Johnson controversially declined to attack Culp's Hill that evening, for which he had a discretionary order. Instead, Johnson's division was the primary force that attacked Culp's Hill on the second and third days, suffering considerable casualties assaulting this impregnable position multiple times with no lasting success. In the fall of 1863, Johnson played a prominent role in the Mine Run Campaign. Capture at Spotsylvania In the Overland Campaign of 1864, Johnson fought well at the Battle of the Wilderness and when Lt. Gen. James Longstreet was seriously wounded there, Robert E. Lee considered Johnson as a replacement corps commander. During the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, on May 12, 1864, at the \\"Bloody Angle\\" section of the Confederate \\"Mule Shoe\\" defensive line, Johnson was captured along with Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart, and most of Johnson's division. He was imprisoned for months at Morris Island, off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina, and was exchanged on August 3, 1864. He was sent west to join Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee, where he commanded a division in the corps of Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee. During the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, Johnson was captured again at the Battle of Nashville on December 16, 1864. He again spent months in a Union prisoner of war camp at Johnson's Island, in Lake Erie. At the end of the war, Johnson was moved to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C., where he was accused of being somehow complicit in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Nothing came of the accusation and he was paroled on July 22, 1865. Postbellum life After the war, Johnson was a farmer in Virginia. He was active in Confederate veterans affairs, including early efforts to construct a monument to Robert E. Lee in Richmond. He died in Richmond and his body lay in state in the state capital until he was buried at Hollywood Cemetery.

Decatur (born 1813, died 1888 or 1889), born Stephen Decatur Bross and often referred to as Commodore Decatur, was one of the earliest settlers in Nebraska. He was born and educated in the East, where he became a school teacher and started a family. After having abandoned his wife and two children in New York in the 1840s, Bross moved west to Nebraska Territory. For the rest of his life, he used the name \\"Stephen Decatur.\\" He was the namesake and one of the incorporators of Decatur, Nebraska, the second-oldest European-American settlement in Nebraska. He gained his nickname of \\"Commodore Decatur\\" by claiming to be a nephew of the Naval hero of the War of 1812. Decatur married again in Nebraska. In 1859 he abandoned his second wife and their child when he moved to Colorado Territory, where he lived in various towns for the remainder of his life. He served a term in the territorial legislature from 1866 to 1868, after the American Civil War. Biography Decatur was born in Sussex County, New Jersey, to Moses Bross and Jane (Winfield) Bross. He was counted as the second of eleven children, because his twin brother William was born a few minutes earlier. They both attended Williams College during the 1830s, and roomed together. William also later went West, settling in Chicago, Illinois. He was later active in the Republican Party and elected as lieutenant governor. Stephen became a schoolteacher under the name Stephen Decatur Bross in New Jersey and New York. In the early 1840s he suddenly disappeared, abandoning his wife and two children. He next surfaced in Nebraska Territory, where he used the name Stephen Decatur. While on the Nebraska frontier, he served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He arrived in what is now the Decatur area, on the upper Missouri River, from Bellevue in 1841. He first made his home with the Omaha tribe, which had long occupied this territory. He lived on a farm called \\"Decatur Springs,\\" named for a spring of pure water found there that supplied water to the town for the next century. Later Decatur worked as a clerk at the trading post of Colonel Peter Sarpy, who had numerous posts in Nebraska affiliated with the American Fur Company. The one in Decatur opened in 1854. Sarpy was also important to early Nebraska development, attracting residents and settlement near such posts. In 1854 Decatur was a candidate to serve in Nebraska's First Territorial Assembly, but he was not seated. He has been described as a \\"highly educated man who claimed he was a nephew of Commodore Stephen Decatur, Naval hero of the War of 1812.\\" The town of Decatur, Nebraska was incorporated in 1856 under the name \\"The Decatur Townsite & Ferry Company.\\" The other incorporators included Thomas Whiteacre, T. H. Hineman, George Mason, and Herman Glass. The patents for the town were granted by the legislatureon May 1, 1862. In Nebraska Decatur married again. In 1859 he moved to the Colorado Territory to work in the gold fields, leaving behind his second wife and their child. During the American Civil War, he enlisted in the 3rd Colorado Regiment. After the war he remained in Colorado, including a stint in Georgetown, where he published the Georgetown Miner. Soon he moved to Summit County, Colorado, which he represented in the territorial legislature from 1866 to 1868. He died June 5, 1888 in Rosita, Colorado, a small camp in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. His age at death was estimated to be 80. He is buried in Rosita Cemetery in Custer County, Colorado.

Stanny The firm's other founding partners were Charles Follen McKim (1847‚Äì1909), and Stanford White (1853‚Äì1906). Life and career Mead was born in Brattleboro, Vermont. He was a cousin of President Rutherford B. Hayes, hence his middle name. His sister, Elinor, later married novelist William Dean Howells, and his younger brother Larkin Goldsmith Mead became a sculptor. William Mead was handsome, authoritative and quiet. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother was the sister of John Humphrey Noyes, the Oneida Utopian. Mead attended Norwich University for two years and graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts in the class of 1867. He later learned architecture under George Fletcher Babb in Russell Sturgis's office in New York City. In 1872, Mead partnered with Charles Follen McKim, a fellow New York architect, but Mead's talent was more for running an office rather than designing. This collaboration with McKim produced one of Mead's only known commissions, a house for an Amherst classmate, Dwight Herrick, from Mead's hometown of Chesterfield, New Hampshire. Around December 1877, the firm took on William Bigelow, the elder brother of McKim's new wife, Annie Bigelow, as a partner, becoming McKim, Mead and Bigelow, with offices at 57 Broadway. In 1879, Bigelow withdrew from the firm, but they were joined by Stanford White to form McKim, Mead, and White. Mead was the partner who \\"hired and fired\\", \\"steered the ship\\", and spent his time \\"trying to keep the partners from making damn fools of themselves.\\" In 1883, Mead married Olga Kilyeni (c.1850-1936) in Budapest, Hungary. They moved to Rome, Italy, where he was heavily involved in the American Academy in Rome ‚Äì McKim's favorite project and legacy ‚Äì until his death. He was an AAR charter member, as was McKim, a Trustee from 1905‚Äì1928, and its President from 1910‚Äì1928. In 1902, King Victor Emmanuel conferred on Mead the decoration of Knight Commander of the Crown of Italy for his pioneer work in introducing the Roman and Italian Renaissance architectural style in America. In 1902, Amherst College conferred upon Mead the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1909, he received a degree of M.S. from Norwich University in Vermont. In 1913 he received the gold medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

It carried 74-guns, being classified as a third rate. During its service it took part in several prominent naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars; including the Glorious First of June, the Battle of Cape Finisterre and the Battle of Trafalgar. History Thunderer was built by the Wells brother's shipyard in Rotherhithe and launched on 13 November 1783. After completion, she was laid up until 1792, when she underwent a 'Middling Repair' to bring her into service in 1793. In 1794 she fought at the Glorious First of June under Captain Albemarle Bertie, and from 1796 to 1801 served in the West Indies, under a succession of captains. During this period, under Captain Pierre Flasse, Thunderer fought at the Battle of Jean-Rabel in which she and forced the crew of the French frigate Harmonie to scuttle their vessel to prevent her capture.

The British ships had to give up on the frigates due to the closeness of the shore. However, Pomone and Thunderer, which had joined the chase, were able to take Eveill√©, of 18 guns, and 100 men. The French force had been out for 60 days and had captured 12 West Indiamen, two of which, Kent and Albion, the British had already recaptured. Pomone and her squadron had recaptured Kent on 9 October. Orion recaptured Albion. Warren's squadron returned to England in December with the remnants of the expedition to Quiberon Bay. In mid-1799 Thunderer was part of a British squadron that detained the schooner Pegasus. Pegasus had been flying an American flag and was carrying 68 slaves from Jamaica to Havana. Her captors sent Pegasus into the Bahamas where they were sold in late June and early July.

In 1805 Thunderer fought in Admiral Calder's fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Her captain, William Lechmere, returned to England to attend a court-martial as a witness to the events of Admiral Calder's action off Cape Finisterre at the time of the battle. Later that year she fought at the Battle of Trafalgar under the command of her First Lieutenant, John Stockham.Ships of the Old Navy, Thunderer. The surgeon on board was Scotsman James Marr Brydone, who was the first of the main British battle fleet to sight the Franco-Spanish fleet. Thunderer signalled the Victory and three minutes later battle orders were signalled to the British fleet beginning the Battle of Trafalgar. On 25 November, Thunderer detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, of 350 tons (bm), four guns and 18 men, Poulovich, master. Nemesis was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Thunderer shared the prize money with ten other British warships. In 1807, Thunderer served in the Dardanelles Operation as part of a squadron under Admiral Sir John Duckworth and was badly damaged when the squadron withdrew from the area. However, she accompanied Duckworth on the Alexandria expedition of 1807, and in May left Alexandria for Malta, where she was provisioned and repaired over a period of 30 days.John Lace. She was decommissioned in November 1808 and broken up in March 1814.

The six boats were built at Varna in Bulgaria, using French-supplied materials and assistance. Drazki and her sisters were built between 1907 and 1908, with Drazki herself being launched in August 1907 and commissioned later that year.Hans Mehl, Naval Guns: 500 Years of Ship and Coastal Artillery, Chatham Publishing, 2002, p. 77De Sergei R.

They were powered by a one-shaft triple-expansion reciprocating engine generating 1,900 hp which gave them a top speed of 26 knots. The four boats were each armed at various times with two 47 mm guns or two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns and three 460 mm torpedo tubes.Bernard Fitzsimons, The Illustrated encyclopedia of 20th century weapons and warfare, Volume 11, Columbia House, 1969, p. 1211 Balkan Wars The Bulgarian Navy's torpedo boats took part in the First Balkan War between 1912 and 1913, serving in the waters of the Black Sea. On 20 November 1912 Letyashti, Smeli, Strogi and Drazki were sent from Varna to intercept a group of Turkish transports. The overall commander was Captain 2nd Rank Dimitar Dobrev, who was embarked on the Letyashti. The Drazki was commanded by Warrant-Officer Georgi Kupov. Shortly after midnight on 21 November they encountered the Ottoman protected cruiser Hamidiye accompanied by two destroyers approximately 32 miles from Varna. Dobrev ordered the ships to close and attack, and at 0043 the Bulgarian ships fired their torpedoes. The first three ships missed, but Drazki was more fortunate. Since she was the last ship in the line, she fired her torpedo at a close range (about 100 m) and scored a hit in the front part of the Hamidiye, causing serious damage, although the ship was able to return to Istanbul for repairs.) Their torpedoes expended, the Bulgarian boats returned to Varna. This engagement was the greatest achievement up to that point in the history of the small Bulgarian Navy. Before the torpedo attack, the Ottoman naval commander had declared an ultimatum to the garrison of Varna to surrender as condition for the town to avoid shelling by the Ottoman Navy. World War I They did not take an active part in the Second Balkan War, however they did see active service in World War I, during which Shumni was sunk by mine on 11/12-9-1916. After World War I the remaining five were judged to be obsolescent and were subsequently reclassified as patrol boats. In 1934 the 3-pounder guns were removed and replaced with two SK C/30 AA guns. World War II When Bulgaria entered World War II on the Axis side, Drazki and her four remaining sisters were antiquated but still capable of carrying out patrols. In 1942 the two SK C/30 AA guns were removed and the 3-pounders were reinstalled. On 15 October 1942, Drazki sank in Varna harbour after a magazine explosion, but she was soon repaired. In 1944 however, she became a gunnery target ship and remained in service in that capacity until the 1950s. Museum ship thumb In 1957 it was decided to commemorate the 50-year-old Drazki, as she was by far the most famous ship in the Bulgarian Navy. However, by that time she had been at least partially broken up for scrap. Her gun, funnel and some of the deck and hull fittings were installed on board her sister ship Strogi, which, after 21 November 1957, became the museum ship Drazki. She is currently preserved as a static land display at the Naval Museum in Varna. Her other sister Hrabri was scrapped in 1962. In 2006 a Wielingen class frigate Wandelaar bought in Belgium for the Bulgarian Navy was named Drazki, and given the identification code F41.

The other references to this article spell it \\"Emmett\\". Collins, his most recent biographer, p. 5, refers to discrepancies on the tombstone, which was erected years after his death. The name of the general's grandson, Lt. Col. Robert Emmet Rodes, indicates that the family supports that spelling of the name. A similar dispute relates to his date of birth, with the tombstone and VMI reporting March 30, the other references March 29, 1828. (March 29, 1829 - September 19, 1864) was a Confederate general in the American Civil War, and the first of Robert E. Lee's divisional commanders not trained at West Point. His division led Stonewall Jackson's devastating surprise attack at the Battle of Chancellorsville; Jackson, on his deathbed, promoted Rodes to major general. Rodes then served in the corps of Richard S. Ewell at the Battle of Gettysburg and in the Overland Campaign, before that corps was sent to the Shenandoah Valley under Jubal Early, where Rodes was killed at the Third Battle of Winchester. Education, antebellum career Rodes was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and graduated from Virginia Military Institute in 1848. He taught at VMI as an assistant professor until 1851; he left when a promotion he wanted to full professor was given instead to Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, who was years later to become one of his commanders during the Civil War. Rodes used his civil engineering skills to become chief engineer for the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was chief engineer of the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad until the start of the war. Although born a Virginian, he chose to serve his adopted state of Alabama in the armed forces of the Confederate States of America (CSA). Civil War Rodes started his Confederate service as a colonel in command of the 5th Alabama Infantry regiment. Rodes went to First Bull Run as part of Brigader General Richard Ewell's brigade, but did not see any action. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as part of Major General D.H. Hill's division. Rodes's first combat experience happened at the Battle of Seven Pines, where he was badly wounded. A few weeks later, he returned to brigade command just prior to the start of the Seven Days Battles. He led his brigade at Gaines Mill, but two days later had to step down due to fever and the lingering effects of his wound and was subsequently assigned to light duty in the defenses of Richmond, Virginia while he recuperated. He recovered in time for General Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the Union, in September 1862, fighting at South Mountain and Antietam. At Antietam, he commanded one of two brigades that held out so long against the Union assault on the sunken road, or \\"Bloody Lane\\", at the center of the Confederate line, suffering heavy casualties. Rodes was lightly wounded by shell fragments. Portrait of Robert E. Rodes () by William D. Washington In the Battle of Chancellorsville, Rodes was a division commander in Stonewall Jackson's corps. He was the first division-level commander in Lee's army who had not graduated from West Point.Joseph B. Kershaw, another non-West Point graduate in Lee's army to achieve division command, did not do so until September 1863; John B. Gordon was promoted in May 1864. Rodes led Jackson's devastating flank attack against the Union XI Corps on May 2, 1863. He was temporarily placed in command of the corps that night when Jackson was mortally wounded and Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill was also wounded. Hill immediately summoned the more senior officer Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, and minutes later Rodes graciously ceded his battlefield command to him. Jackson on his deathbed recommended that Rodes be promoted to major general and this promotion be back-dated to be effective May 2. When Lee reorganized the Army of Northern Virginia to compensate for the loss of Jackson, Rodes joined the Second Corps under Richard Ewell. In the Battle of Gettysburg, on July 1, 1863, Rodes led the assault from Oak Hill against the right flank of the Union I Corps. Although he successfully routed the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Robinson and drove it back through the town, the attack was not as well coordinated or pursued as aggressively as his reputation would have implied. His division sat idle for the remaining two days of the battle. Rodes continued to fight with Ewell's corps through the 1864 Overland Campaign of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Ewell was replaced by Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, and the corps was sent by Lee to the Shenandoah Valley to draw Union forces away from Petersburg, in the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Early conducted a long and successful raid down the Valley, into Maryland, and reached the outskirts of Washington, D.C., before turning back. Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan was sent by Grant to drive Early from the Valley once and for all. On September 19, 1864, Sheridan attacked the Confederates at the Battle of Opequon, also known as the Third Battle of Winchester. Several wives of Confederate officers were chased from town during the attack and Rodes managed to save Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon's wife from capture. Rodes and Gordon prepared to attack Sheridan's forces when Rodes was struck in the back of his head by a Union shell fragment. He died on the field outside Winchester. Rodes was mourned by the Confederacy as a promising, brave, and aggressive officer killed before he could achieve greatness. Robert E. Lee and other high-ranking officers wrote sympathetic statements. Rodes is buried beside his brother, Virginius Hudson Rodes, who had been his adjutant throughout the War, in Presbyterian Cemetery, Lynchburg, Virginia.Shenandoah at WarBloody Autumn He and his wife, Virginia Hortense Woodruff (1833‚Äì1907), had two children, Robert Emmet Rodes, Jr. (1863‚Äì1925) and Bell Yancey Rodes (1865‚Äì1931).

The Dutch term is Blazoen, and in either Dutch or French, the term is often used to refer to the coat of arms of a chamber of rhetoric.\\"Blazoens of the Flemish chambers of rhetoric\\". In the anonymous \\"Vlaerdings Redenrijck-bergh\\" published in Amsterdam in 1617 and now available online through the DBNL. History Blason de Clovis The term forms the root of the modern words \\"emblazon\\", which means to celebrate or adorn with heraldic markings, and \\"blazoner\\", one who emblazons. The terms \\"blason\\", \\"blasonner\\", \\"blasonneur\\" were used in 16th-century French literature by poets who, following Cl√©ment Marot in 1536, practised a genre of poems that praised a woman by singling out different parts of her body and finding appropriate metaphors to compare them with. It is still being used with that meaning in literature and especially in poetry. One famous example of such a celebratory poem, ironically rejecting each proposed stock metaphor, is William Shakespeare's Sonnet 130: :My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks, And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. :I love to hear her speak, yet well I know, That music hath a far more pleasing sound. I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare. Related phrases Blason draws on Petrarchan conventions of representing the female beloved in Petrarch's Canzoniere of the 14th century. Petrarch never offers a complete picture of his beloved Laura, but depicts her only as parts of a woman. The French Blason tradition can also be considered anti-Petrarchan, as it moves away from the adulatory tone of the Petrarchan sonnet (Petrarchism was so pervasive in the Renaissance, it also included subversion of Petrarchan conventions). The term Blason populaire is a phrase in which one culture or ethnic group increases its own self-esteem by belittling others e.g. Samuel Johnson's description that \\"The noblest prospect which a Scotsman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England!\\". This term originated from Alfred Canel's travelogue Blason Populaire de la Normandie (1859), in which people from Normandy boasted about themselves while sneering at other regions.Blason populaire de la Normandie, comprenant les proverbes, sobriquets ou dictons relatifs √† cette province, Alfred Canel, 1859, on Google books  Related genres  Other cultures have types of blason poetry.

The island, with a sandy beach known as Dollymount Strand running its entire length, is a relatively recent, and inadvertent, result of human intervention in the bay. The island lies within the jurisdiction of, and is mostly owned by, Dublin City Council, and is managed by the Council's Parks and Landscape Division. Bull Island, which is accessed by way of a causeway bridge from Raheny and a wooden bridge from Clontarf, has the most designations of any site in the country, as a National Bird Sanctuary, a biosphere reserve, a National Nature Reserve, a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive, and a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, while also being the subject of a Special Amenity Area Order. It is a car-free zone. It holds a wide variety of plant and bird species, and a limited range of mammals, one reptile, one amphibian and a modest range of invertebrates; one mammal species, the hare, became extinct in the later 2010s. History=Background In times past, Dublin Bay had a long-running problem with silting, notably at the mouth of the River Liffey. After years of primitive dredging, an attempt to maintain a clear channel more effectively was begun when, in 1715, the first piles were driven of what was to become the Great South Wall, completed in 1730. This barrier was breached by storm action some years later, and in 1761, a stone pier was commenced, working from the Poolbeg Lighthouse (1768), back to shore, the construction of massive granite blocks being completed in 1795. It was during this period that the building of a North Bull Wall was also proposed, and when it was seen that the South Wall did not solve the silting problem, the authorities responsible for Dublin Port commissioned studies on the matter. Captain William Bligh, of Bounty fame, surveyed Dublin Bay for the Ballast Board in 1801, highlighting the potential of the North Bull sandbank. Its purpose was to clear a sandbar by Venturi action. Bull Bridge, North Bull Wall and the beginning of Bull Island Wooden bridge at Dollymount A wooden bridge, the first Bull Bridge, was erected in 1819 to facilitate the construction of a stone wall, based on a design by Ballast Board engineer, George Halpin. Started in 1820, the Bull Wall was completed in 1825, at a cost of ¬£95,000. Over the succeeding 48 years, the natural tidal effects created by the walls deepened the entry to the Liffey from 1.8 m to 4.8 m. Much of the silt now scoured from the river course was deposited on the North Bull, and a true island began to emerge, with people venturing out to the growing beach. The volume of visitors was increased by the commencement of horse tram services to Clontarf in 1873, and further by the laying of a full tram line to Howth, opening in 1900, with stops in the Clontarf / Dollymount area, and a Coast Guard station was built at the landward end of the Bull Wall. A lighthouse sits on the North Bull Wall. Growth and early usage of the island The island continued to grow in extent, from the Bull Wall towards Howth Head. In addition to picnics and swimming, the island was used for shooting practice, and in 1880, an international rifle match between Ireland and the USA was held there, with an audience numbering several thousand. In 1889, the Royal Dublin Golf Club, then located at Sutton, sought and received permission of Colonel Vernon and the Dublin Port and Docks Board to lay out a golf course at the city end of the island, and construct a clubhouse. Sometime in the early 20th century, a track suitable for walking and handcarts, running from a slipway at the point where the Howth Road comes from Raheny's village centre down to the coast, was formed. Usable at low tide, this 150m track allowed access to the island for leisure and beachcombing (timber, coal and other items lost overboard from ships accessing Dublin Port were washed up on the island's strand). Between 1906 and 1907, a new Bull Bridge was constructed ‚Äì it is still standing. Then, in 1912, the Dollymount Sea Scouts (9th Dublin (2nd Port of Dublin)) were formed, taking part of the disused Coast Guard station as their den (\\"Crow's Nest\\") ‚Äì the troop continues to operate from there, now called 5th Port Dollymount. Looking along Dollymount Strand to the SW. The chimneys of the Poolbeg Generating Station are visible in the distance. 1914 to 1930 The British Army commandeered the whole island on 5 September 1914, for military training ‚Äì primarily as a firing range but also for trench warfare practice. The Royal Dublin Golf Club clubhouse was used as officers' quarters and considerable damage was done to the building and, particularly due to trench warfare practice, the island environment as a whole. Late in this period, three local people started to dig golf holes at the Raheny end of the island, and after discussions with the Royal Dublin, and with Lady Ardilaun, formed a new golf club, named, in honour of the Guinness estate, St. Anne's. The first drive-in at what was a nine-hole course until 1989, took place on 1 July 1921. 1931 - present In 1931, a plan was proposed to develop the island and the waters between it and the coast. Called the \\"Blue Lagoon Scheme,\\" this would have included dams and sluices at the Wooden Bridge and Sutton Channel, maintaining a high water level behind the island, which itself might hold some housing or tourism facilities. Further plans were advanced by Bord Failte, including conversion of much of the island as a theme park. In 1931 Dublin Corporation was convinced by campaigners like the Jesuit ornithologist Fr. Patrick G. Kennedy SJ (1881‚Äì1966),Bull Island - Irish Sanctuary www.manrsea.ie who wrote An Irish Sanctuary ‚Äì Birds of the North Bull (1953), to apply for Bull Island to be made a sanctuary by the government.North Bull Island Bird Report 2018 Situation Star of the Sea statue The island is connected to the mainland by the Bull Bridge, today a one-lane wooden road bridge (with weight and height restrictions) at the southern (Clontarf/Dollymount) end, and by a broad causeway at Raheny, approximately halfway along, and forms part of Raheny and Clontarf districts. Most of North Bull Island is property of Dublin City Council, after the buying-out of interests such as the Howth Estate, exceptions having included the Bull Wall, the breakwater beyond it, and the wooden bridge to it, which were owned by the Dublin Port Company (and closed for a day each year to ensure that no right of way was created), and the Royal Dublin Golf Club links, only the latter remaining. St. Anne's Golf Club rent from the Council. The bulk of the island comprises the largest park owned by the city. There are just a few residents on the island, in houses beside the wooden bridge built by the Dublin Port Company for its employees. In addition to the clubhouses of the two golf clubs, there is the newly re-built Sea Scout den at the Clontarf end, and a small cafe. At the end of the North Bull Wall is the famous Star of the Sea (Realt na Mara) statue, funded by Dublin Port workers and sailors, and dedicated by the then archbishop of Dublin in 1972. Continuing development The island continues to grow and it is a possibility that within the next half-century continued deposition may lead to its merging with the mainland at Red Rock in Sutton, forming a lagoon, changing the make-up of the area's wildlife and landlocking two dinghy sailing clubs. However, the risk of this is considered small due to the strength of currents and depth of water in Sutton Channel. Geology and hydrology Bull Island Interpretative Centre The island is primarily a sand structure approximately 5 km long and under 1 km wide. The southeast-facing side is a flat beach, Dollymount Strand, backed by marram-grass-anchored dunes, scrub and marsh. On the northern side of the Bull, between the island and the mainland, is a large linear saltmarsh complex backed by mudflats all of which are covered at high tide. Several of the city's small rivers and streams enter the bay here, notably the Naniken River, the Santry River, Fox Stream, Blackbanks Stream and Daunagh Water. Furthermore, the city's second largest river by volume, the River Tolka, has its estuary facing the city end of the island, into which the Wad River, and a combination of several smaller watercourses, also flow. Fauna=Birds A wide range of birds visit Bull Island, with a more limited set nesting there; most are either winter feeders, or pass through in spring and autumn. Wading species include Eurasian curlews, Eurasian oystercatchers and redshanks, while others include shelduck, teal, pale-bellied brent geese, and various gulls. Also encountered are grey plovers, bar-tailed godwits, northern shovellers, little egrets, reed buntings and little terns. Mammals There were a number of terrestrial mammal species on the island for decades, with one becoming extinct in the 2010s and one added. Species include the pygmy shrew, brown rat, red fox, field mouse, hedgehog, European rabbit and Irish hare, the latter having become extinct between 2016 and 2019, while the stoat has been observed since the mid-2010s. There have been claimed sightings of bats also but it is not clear if there are any roosting sites on the island. Hares, which are believed to have populated from the farmlands of Raheny and Kilbarrack, were very common up until the 1960s, but the building of the causeway led to a reduction in their numbers due to disturbance. During the 1970s, fifty to a hundred were still present, but numbers continued to decline, though they were still noted as common at least as late as 1986. Despite a reintroduction programme in the 1990s, their population continued to fall, and having been on the verge of extinction for a period, with only one or two found in surveys undertaken in 2014,North Bull Island Wildlife (website) no hare has been seen since 2016. During a study of hares on the island during the 1990s it was concluded that poor breeding success due to disturbance from people and, more seriously, dogs, was the main cause of the drop-off in numbers. Hares were more vulnerable than other species as they do not shelter in burrows; they are also active in the daytime. The rabbit was also once much more numerous than it is today. In 1991 myxomatosis entered the population and caused devastating losses. Shortly after this, in 1992, rabbit haemorrhagic disease was also found in blood samples taken from sick rabbits. Common seals and grey seals are also found in the surrounding waters and can regularly be seen hauled out on sand at low tide at the tip of the island near Howth. The island is a breeding site. Harbour porpoise can also be seen sometimes out in the bay. Reptiles There is a modest population of the common lizard on the island. Amphibians The common frog has a stable and substantial presence on the island. Invertebrates The island is also home to ground beetles, various species of butterflies and moths, aphids, wasps, snails, spiders and harvestmen, earthworms and woodlice. Flora The island is home to many species of plants, including the bee orchid, pyramidal orchid, Marsh Helleborine, Bee orchid and common spotted orchids. The most important plant type is marram grass, which helps to retain the structure of the dunes. Designations North Bull Island has the most designations of any site in the Republic of Ireland and its importance for nature conservation has been recognised since 1914, when it was listed as a Rothschild Reserve. It was the first National Bird Sanctuary, designated in 1931. It has been designated since 1981 by UNESCO as biosphere reserve that is part of the Dublin Bay Biosphere Reserve. It is the only Biosphere Reserve entirely in a capital city in the world. In 1988, it was designated a National Nature Reserve in 1988. It is of European Union importance, and part of the Natura 2000 Network as both a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. It is also a National Special Amenity Area since 1995, one of 3 in the Republic of Ireland. This recognises both its outstanding beauty and nature conservation values. Intrepretative centre There is an Interpretative Centre at the end of the causeway on the right hand side which has displays and information on the flora and fauna of the island, and there are also information signs to either side of the causeway access, and on the roundabout where the causeway road approaches the beach. The Centre was opened in 1986 and provides a base for many schools and educational groups to visit the Island. It was funded by the European Commission and the Dublin Rotary Club. Leisure activities=Walking Dollymount Strand Dollymount Strand, the 5 km beach on the island, is a popular walking and recreational area. Walking of dogs is also popular, though they are supposed to be kept under control, due to the National Nature Reserve status, and in particular to fears of attacks on rabbits and hares. It is possible to walk a circuit that includes the beach and St. Anne's Park. Driving Many people learned to drive on the firm flat sandy foreshore at low tide; there are even (very low) speed limits posted on the beach. For about two decades, access by car was limited to a portion of the island near the Bull Bridge and two sections reached from the causeway at Raheny, the latter having ceased in 2016. Swimming Bathing shelter on the Bull Wall The strand is historically a popular swimming spot but usage fell sharply as pollution rose in the 1980s, mainly due to sewage and stormwater pollution. Following the Dublin Bay Water Quality Management Plan programme in the 1990s, there were significant improvements to water quality and, for several years Blue Flag status was obtained. As Blue Flag criteria have become more stringent, Dollymount has not achieved Blue Flag in recent years, although the beach is maintained to Blue Flag standards. Water quality continues to be affected by several issues, including lack of capacity of existing sewage treatment facilities, excess nutrients flowing into Dublin Bay from the River Liffey and other watercourses, and stormwater pollution. Kite-surfing A kite enthusiast enjoys good flying weather on Bull Island with Howth and the Sutton Martello tower in the background.In recent years Bull Island has also become popular with kite-surfers, with a declared kite-surfing launch area near the Bull Wall, accessed from the wooden Bull Wall Bridge. The shallow water and long stretch of straight beach allows for safe kite-surfing. This has encouraged many beginners to take up the sport on the island. Golf The island has two golf courses, the more famous belonging to the Royal Dublin Golf Club, and the newer, owned by Dublin City Council, operated by St. Anne's Golf Club. Each has a clubhouse with dining facilities. DemographicsFilm and television It has been used as a location in many Dublin themed movies such as Neil Jordan's Michael Collins, Stephen Frears's The Van, Brendan O'Carroll's Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie and John Carney's Oscar-winning movie Once.

Early life and career Gregg was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. He was the first cousin of future Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin and the grandson of Pennsylvania Congressman Andrew Gregg. He graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1855 and was given a commission as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons Regiment (heavy cavalry). During his tenure at West Point, he interacted with two classmates who would become great cavalry generals‚Äîan opponent and a commander, respectively: J.E.B. Stuart, class of 1854, and Philip Sheridan, class of 1853. His first real assignment was in the New Mexico Territory, as a company commander in the 1st U.S. Dragoons. His unit was ordered to California and he traveled with his friend Dorsey Pender; they later bought a racehorse together. His company then marched to Fort Vancouver, in Washington Territory. During this tour of duty, Lt. Gregg had his first taste of combat, engaged with 160 men against 1,000 Indian warriors, who had surrounded them. The fighting lasted for three days, although casualties were minor, and Gregg managed a fighting retreat. Civil War Union General David McMurtrie Gregg (seated with slouch hat and beard) and his staff At the start of the Civil War, Gregg returned to Washington, D.C., where he was promoted to captain in the 3rd U.S. Cavalry, followed soon by a transfer to the 6th U.S. Cavalry. He developed typhoid fever and barely escaped death when his Washington hospital caught fire. In January 1862 he became colonel of the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Gregg and the 8th Pennsylvania fought in the Peninsula Campaign, where he distinguished himself in the Seven Days Battles, expertly screening retreating Union infantry. The Battle of Antietam was his next engagement, but cavalry played little role. He received a furlough and married Ellen F. Sheaff on October 6, 1862, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; the couple honeymooned in New York City. Gregg was promoted to brigadier general just before the Battle of Fredericksburg. As at Antietam, the cavalry was underutilized and held in reserve. He commanded a brigade in the division of Alfred Pleasonton. Gregg was sent to assume command of another cavalry brigade when its commander, Brig. Gen. George Dashiell Bayard, was killed by an artillery shell that reached behind the infantry lines. After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker assumed command of the demoralized Army of the Potomac, he shook up the cavalry organization, because the mounted arm had not been used effectively. He removed cavalry units from corps and divisions, and consolidated them as a separate Cavalry Corps, under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman. Gregg assumed command of the 3rd Division in February 1863. (Although infantry divisions are typically commanded by major generals, few Union cavalry division leaders rose above brigadier general, and Gregg was no exception.) At the Battle of Chancellorsville, Stoneman's corps, including Gregg's division, was dispatched on a raid around Lee's left flank to destroy facilities in his rear. The raid lasted nine days and caused a lot of destruction in the rear of the Army of Northern Virginia, but it accomplished little strategically and Stoneman was widely criticized for lack of aggression and not being able to draw any Confederate forces away from the main battle. Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton replaced Stoneman in command of the Cavalry Corps. During the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, Lee's stealthy troop movements away from the Fredericksburg area caused Union consternation and Pleasonton was ordered to find out where they were going. Launching a surprise attack on Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Brandy Station resulted in the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war. The initial assault crossed the Rappahannock River at Beverly Ford under command of Brig. Gen. John Buford. While Buford attacked, Gregg led the 2nd and 3rd Divisions across Kelly's Ford to attack the flank and rear of the Confederates on Fleetwood Hill, where Stuart's headquarters were located. The fighting was fierce, saber-wielding, and hand-to-hand. The Confederates managed to repulse Gregg. The battle overall was essentially a draw, although it surprised and humiliated Stuart, and orders left behind provided valuable intelligence about Lee's intentions to invade Maryland and Pennsylvania. In the middle of the Gettysburg Campaign, Pleasonton reorganized his corps and Gregg now commanded the 2nd Division. He led it in cavalry engagements at Aldie, Middleburg, and Upperville. While his fellow, newly promoted division commander Brig. Gen. John Buford was initiating the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, Gregg was still moving north. His division arrived mid-day on July 2 and took up positions to protect the right flank and rear of the Union Army. On July 3, Three miles east of Gettysburg, in what is now called \\"East Cavalry Field\\", Stuart's forces collided with Gregg's division and Brig. Gen. George A. Custer's brigade of the 3rd Division. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand combat, ensued. Both sides claimed victory. After the battle Gregg took his division to Chambersburg Pa, and did not participate in the Cavalry pursuit of the Army of Northern Va. In October 1863, Lee attempted to flank the Union army near Warrenton, Virginia. Gregg's division delayed Lee until the II Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren arrived to block the movement. Gregg caused an incident when, after this engagement, he did not get adequate mention in Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's after action report and demanded a court of inquiry to correct the record. Gregg commanded the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in early 1864 until the arrival of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, who commanded the cavalry of the forces of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the Overland Campaign. The most important use of Gregg's cavalry during this campaign was to screen Union movements southward, battle to battle, but a significant raid was staged that culminated in the Battle of Yellow Tavern, where J.E.B. Stuart was mortally wounded, dealing the Confederacy a hard blow. Gregg's division also was heavily engaged at the Battle of Haw's Shop, where it fought Wade Hampton's troopers west of Hanovertown, Virginia. Hampton had superior numbers, but Gregg's troopers had the Spencer repeating rifle. Finally, Custer's brigade attacked through difficult terrain, ousting Hampton's men from their position. Concluding the raid culminating in the Battle of Trevilian Station, Sheridan's cavalry retreated toward Bermuda Hundred. Gregg's division covered the retreat, especially in the Battle of Saint Mary's Church. Gregg's division survived a strong attack directed by Wade Hampton, but it lost several prisoners, including Colonel Pennock Huey. Gregg commanded the cavalry division that remained near Petersburg while Sheridan was engaged in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign against Jubal Early. In his role as cavalry commander, Gregg screened various union movements in the Siege of Petersburg. Gregg's division was particularly engaged at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom, the Second Battle of Ream's Station, and the Battle of Peebles' Farm. Near the end of his service, he was promoted to the brevet rank of major general. Later life David Gregg resigned his army commission, in a letter dated January 25, 1865: Gregg's real reasons for resigning before the end of the war are lost to history. According to Edward Longacre's biography of Gen. John Buford, Gregg feared a violent death in battle and described himself as a \\"coward\\" when, in late 1864, his nerve finally gave way and he resigned his commission.Longacre, p. 141. He missed exciting cavalry actions in the Appomattox Campaign. He settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, his wife's home. He farmed near Milford, Delaware, but his life was dull and he apparently regretted leaving the army. In 1868 he applied for reinstatement, but the cavalry command he wanted went to his cousin, John Irvin Gregg, so he remained an unhappy civilian. In 1874, he was appointed by President Grant to be U.S. Consul to Prague, Austria-Hungary, but soon returned home because his wife was homesick. Gregg was active in state and local affairs and raised funds to preserve Valley Forge as a national shrine. He visited Gettysburg Battlefield numerous times and gave speeches at events. In 1891, he became active in politics and was elected to a term as Auditor General of Pennsylvania. Gregg died in Reading, Pennsylvania, one of the oldest survivors of the war in the state, and is buried there in Charles Evans Cemetery. He is memorialized with a bronze equestrian statue in Reading, and the city's American Legion Post is named \\"Gregg Post\\" in his honor.

The first socialist party in Ireland, it was founded in 1892 by a conference of Belfast Independent Labour activists and trade unionists. The party affiliated itself to the British Labour Representation Committee in 1900 and remained attached to its successor; the UK Labour Party. Labour ran the Unionist Party close in Belfast North in a by-election in 1905 and in the general election of 1906 with William Walker as its candidate.Westminster Elections in the future Northern Ireland, 1885-1910 by Nicholas WhyteSectarian Divisions of Ulster Labor Politics 1885-1906 by Wade Shen In 1913, the Labour National Executive Committee agreed that the Irish Labour Party should have organising rights over the entirety of Ireland. The Belfast Labour Party disagreed with this and, faced with the British party's refusal to reconsider, formed the independent Belfast Labour Representation Committee, which declared itself a party in 1917. The party won 12 seats on Belfast Corporation in 1920, but soon lost these. Suffragette, Independent Labour and Co-operative activist Margaret McCoubrey in 1920 was elected a Labour councillor for the Dock ward of Belfast.McCoubrey, Margaret 1880-1955 Dictionary of Ulster Biography Nonetheless, the party came a very close second in Belfast West in the 1923 UK general election before forming with others the Northern Ireland Labour Party. Ideology=Position on Partition & United Ireland Whilst the party dissociated itself from the wider British Labour movement after the Labour party granted full organizing rights over Ireland to the Irish Labour party, the Belfast Labour party pursued a far more nuanced position over the divisive subject of partition. The party found it difficult to sidestep this issue between 1920 and 1922, when the topic pervaded political life in Ireland. In its desire to avoid division over the subject, the party did not directly contest the 1921 Northern Irish election, instead supporting 4 independent candidates. The party's attempt to tip-toe the national question was shown in the campaign run by Harry Midgley in 1924 in the constituency of Belfast West. In the Protestant Belfast ward of Shankhill Midgley emphasized his Protestantism and his military service in the British army during World War One. In contrast, in the Catholic Falls area he attacked the policy of internment of prisoners and showed support for the idea of a United Ireland.

Wilhelm served as a cavalry officer in the army of the then-independent Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. He also tested cannon for the Army of W√ºrttemberg, some of which can still be seen at Lichtenstein Castle, which he substantially rebuilt in the 1840s. He was inspired by the romantic historical novel Lichtenstein by Wilhelm Hauff (1826). Hauff was in turn inspired by the works of Walter Scott. He was created Duke of Urach on 28 March 1867, with the style of Serene Highness.French webpage with image Wilhelm was a junior member of the royal family of W√ºrttemberg. He was a nephew of King Frederick (d. 1816), and was a first cousin of King William I of W√ºrttemberg (ruled 1816‚Äì1864).  Public Life  Reporting to King William I (1847), a group portrait. All the participants are identified on the painting's page at Wikimedia Commons. Wilhelm was raised in the mentally stimulating parental home. From 1819 to 1823, William and his elder brother Alexander, who later became famous as a poet, stayed at the Fellenberg'sche Hofwyl Institute in Bern. Wilhelm returned to Stuttgart and was appointed Captain in the mounted artillery at the age of 18. In 1835, he was promoted to Major, and in 1837 to Colonel and commander of the artillery. In 1841, he was promoted to Major General and put in charge of an infantry brigade. He can be seen in 1847, sixth from the right in \\"Reporting to King William I\\", a painting of William I of W√ºrttemberg and his advisers, by the court painter Franz Seraph Stirnbrand. He is talking with Crown Prince Charles, and the King is interviewing Prince Frederick. In 1848 W√ºrttemberg contributed a field brigade to the combined division of the southern German states that marched into the First Schleswig War. The division was led by Lieutenant General Moriz von Miller; Wilhelm assumed command of the W√ºrttemberg brigade. After the Treaty of Malm√∂, the brigade was stationed at Altona and did not see any real action. Most of the brigade, including Wilhelm was then moved to Upper Baden, leaving on battalion in Schleswig. The brigade did observation work in Upper Baden, especially in the Constance district, but did not engage in any fighting. Wilhelm was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1855. In 1857, he was appointed governor of Ulm. In 1862 he converted to Roman Catholicism to enable his second marriage to Princess Florestine of Monaco. In 1867, he was promoted to General of the Infantry. On 28 May 1867, he was raised to Duke of Urach, while retaining the dignity of Count of W√ºrttemberg. Duke William's favorite weapon was the artillery. He was regarded as an outstanding mathematician and an officer of his weapon and made some inventions, especially with regards to the mounting of the guns. He tried to dampen the recoil of the gun by suspending the gun carriage in a movable frame. His very active and universally educated mind did not find enough activity in the military during the long period of peace. Historian Lichtenstein Castle (W√ºrttemberg), reconstructed in 1840 by Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach He was keenly interested in the arts and sciences, and in particular in art history and archeology. He made study trips and co-founded the w√ºrttembergischen Altertumsverein (W√ºrttemberg Society for Ancient History) in 1843 and the Verein f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Naturkunde (Association for National Natural history) in 1844 and continued to support these. He also acted repeatedly as president of the overall association of German societies of Ancient History. His taste for art showed in 1840 and 1841, when he constructed Lichtenstein Castle on the spot of the by then completely ruined ancient castle made famous by Wilhelm Hauff's novel Lichtenstein. He moved a significant number of Renaissance style sculptures from the Neues Lusthaus in Stuttgart to Lichtenstein Castle when the Lusthaus was to be demolished in 1844, to make room for the Royal Court Theater. He was an honorary member of several scientific associations and learned societies, such as the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Academia and Literature Duke Wilhelm in later years In 1845, he received an honorary PhD from the philosophy department of the University of T√ºbingen, in recognition of his scientific endeavour. Among his literary works were Wegweiser durch s√§mtliche Malerschulen und Gem√§ldesammlungen von W. W. (\\"Guide to all schools of painting and art collections by W.W.\\") and Graphisch-arch√§ologische Vergleichungen (\\"Graphical- archaeological comparisons\\") and the meteorological Aufkl√§rende Worte √ºber Wetterprophezeihung von W. W. (\\"Clarifying words about the prediction of the weather, by W.W.\\"). His Politische Skizzen √ºber Deutschland und W√ºrttemberg aus der Mappe eines Conservativen (\\"Political Sketches of Germany and W√ºrttemberg from the folder of a conservative\\") appeared anonymously in 1852. In 1869 Duke Wilhelm suffered a stroke. He went to Bad Wildbad in the Black Forest in the hope that he might be healed by the southern climate. However, this was in vain.

None of these refugees were hurt or killed during the attacks. Rusesabagina's efforts were the basis of the dramatized Academy Award-nominated film Hotel Rwanda (2004), in which he was portrayed by American actor Don Cheadle. He has homes in Brussels, Belgium and San Antonio, Texas. Rusesabagina is Belgian citizen and has a US green card. Rusesabagina founded the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation to fight for global human rights. On 31 August 2020, he was arrested in Kigali after a trip to Dubai on \\"terrorism charges\\", being accused of supporting opposition parties. Rusesabagina and his family deny all charges. Birth and career Rusesabagina was one of nine children born to a Hutu father and Tutsi mother in Murama, Rwanda. Rusesabagina's parents sent him to school in a town near Gitwe run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. By the age of 13, he was fluent in English and French. He married his first wife, Esther Sembeba, on 8 September 1967. By the end of his adolescence, Rusesabagina had decided to become a minister. He and his wife moved to Cameroon where he studied at seminary. In December 1978, he, his wife, and two children moved to Kigali. While there, a childhood friend, Isaac Mulihano, invited Rusesabagina to apply for an opening to work at the H√¥tel des Mille Collines. He was offered a position and was later sent to Switzerland and Brussels to study hotel management. Due to distance and his commitment to work, he and Esther legally separated in 1981. Rusesabagina was granted full custody of their three children: Diane, Lys, and Roger. In 1987, he was invited to a wedding where he met Tatiana, the maid of honor and a Tutsi nurse in Ruhengeri. Rusesabagina bribed a frequent customer of the Mille Collines, a Minister of Health, to transfer Tatiana to a job at Central Hospital in Kigali. Tatiana and Paul married two years later and she adopted his children. Later, they had a son together named Tr√©sor. In 1992, Paul Rusesabagina was promoted to assistant general manager of the Diplomates Hotel, an affiliate of the H√¥tel des Mille Collines. Rwandan genocide In Rwanda, while Paul was receiving education in Nairobi, Switzerland, and Brussels, the Hutu-dominated government of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana faced pressure from a Tutsi-led rebel force as they tried to maintain their power. Machetes were ordered and brought to the capital and given to the Interahamwe; while Tutsi were being discriminated against, a rumour brought on by a radio station RTLM explained that the Tutsi wanted to kill all the Hutus. On 6 April 1994, President Habyarimana's plane was shot down by surface-to-air missiles as it approached the Kigali Airport for landing. On board the plane with Habyarimana were the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Rwandan Army Chief of Staff D√©ogratias Nsabimana, and Colonel Elie Sagatwa, the head of presidential security. The wreckage landed in the garden of the presidential palace and everyone on board was killed. The Rwandan genocide started on 6 April 1994. On 7 April 1994, the Presidential Guard assassinated Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana along with many other ministers, mainly those from political parties different from that of the assassinated Habyarimana and those slated to play important roles in the transitional government that had been planned to be instated on 8 April. Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers were also killed. Interahamwe hunted down Tutsi and began killing them at the start of the genocide. Though Rusesabagina was Hutu (his father was Hutu and his mother Tutsi), his wife Tatiana was a Tutsi and his children considered mixed. Due to this, he was unable to escape from the war zone with his family. When the violence broke out, Rusesabagina brought his family to the H√¥tel des Mille Collines for safety. As other managers departed, Rusesabagina phoned the hotel's corporate owners, Sabena, and secured a letter appointing him the acting general manager of the Mille Collines. When a murderous Hutu militia threatened to enter the Mille Collines, Rusesabagina ensured that his wife and children fled safely in a truck past the militia's roadblocks. The truck set out for Kigali airport so they could flee to another country. He remained in the hotel to tend to the refugees. Tatiana and her children were specifically targeted within the convoy by radio messages, and returned to the hotel after being attacked. Tatiana's family faced extreme tragedy. Her mother, brother and sister-in-law, and four nieces and nephews died in the genocide. Her father paid Hutu militia to execute him so that he would not die a more painful death: The Interahamwe left nearly 1 million dead. Tutsi rebels pushed the Hutu militia into the Congo in July 1994, after over half of the Tutsis in Rwanda had been murdered. Rusesabagina took orphans from the camp behind Tutsi rebel lines with him to Tanzania, to keep them safe and away from Rwanda. By the end of the massacre, four of his eight siblings remained alive. He comments in his autobiography that \\"for a Rwandan family, this is a comparatively lucky outcome.\\" Rusesabagina, his wife and children, and the refugees eventually managed to escape to Tanzania, thanks to the Rwandan Patriotic Front. After staying in Rwanda for two more years, Rusesabagina applied for asylum in Belgium and moved to Brussels with his wife, children, and his two adopted nieces in 1996 after receiving credible threats on his life. When they received threats again, they settled in Texas although they still maintain their Belgium home. Arrest On 31 August 2020, Rusesabagina was arrested for charges of terrorism, arson, kidnap and \\"murder perpetrated against unarmed, innocent Rwandan civilians on Rwandan territory\\". According to a Twitter post by the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB), he was arrested in Kigali on an international warrant and is \\"the founder, leader, sponsor and member of violent, armed, extremist terror outfits\\", including the Rwanda Movement for Democratic Change and the Party for Democracy in Rwanda. Kitty Kurth, a spokeswoman for his Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation, said: \\"We believe he was kidnapped and taken by extraordinary rendition to Rwanda\\". Rusesabagina's adopted daughter Carine Kanimba has claimed: \\"What they're accusing him of is all made up. There is no evidence to what they're claiming...We know this is a wrongful arrest\\". The authorities have not yet provided any evidence of the charges against him. Rusesabagina's lawyers and writers in several news outlets have argued that the arrest was motivated by Rusesabagina's outspoken criticism of the Rwandan government, in line with other arrests and disappearances of dissidents under the presidency of Paul Kagame. Rusesabagina, a permanent resident of the United States who has not lived in Rwanda since an assassination attempt in 1996, had gone on a trip to Dubai shortly before being arrested. In a jailhouse interview with The New York Times, Rusesabagina stated that in Dubai, he boarded a private plane that he thought was bound for Burundi, where he planned to speak at the invitation of a Christian pastor; instead, the plane took him to Kigali.

In his 2006 autobiography, Rusesabagina alleges, \\"Rwanda is today a nation governed by and for the benefit of a small group of elite Tutsis... Those few Hutus who have been elevated to high-ranking posts are usually empty suits without any real authority of their own. They are known locally as Hutus de service or Hutus for hire.\\" He has also criticized Kagame's election to president. On 6 April 2006, Kagame suggested, \\"[Rusesabagina] should try his talents elsewhere and not climb on the falsehood of being a hero, because it's totally false.\\" Francois Xavier Ngarambe, the president of Ibuka, the umbrella body of survivors' associations for the genocide, said of Rusesabagina, \\"he has hijacked heroism. He is trading with the genocide. He should be charged.\\" Terry George, the director of Hotel Rwanda, characterized the comment as part of a smear campaign. In 2007, Rusesabagina claimed that the killings committed by the RPF rebels during the conflict constituted genocide. The historian G√©rard Prunier agrees that the RPF committed \\"horrendous crimes\\", but he rejects the notion of a \\"double genocide\\", which he argues \\"does not stand up to serious inquiry\\". In 2008, the book Hotel Rwanda or the Tutsi Genocide as seen by Hollywood, by Alfred Ndahiro, a public relations advisor to Kagame, and journalist Privat Rutazibwa, was published.Movie sparks public feud It provides an alternative take to the portrayal of Rusesabagina's actions as seen in the film Hotel Rwanda. Rusesabagina has consistently denied allegations put forward by the Rwandan government accusing Rusesabagina of helping the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Rwandan Hutu rebel group. In a 2010 interview with CNN, Rusesabagina said: \\"I have sent no money to terrorists... He [the prosecutor] is not only lying, but lying with bad logic... This is pure and simple fabrication from Kigali.\\"Karimi, Faith. \\"'Hotel Rwanda' hero denies sending money to rebels.\\" CNN. 28 October 2010. Retrieved 28 October 2010. Rusesabagina stated in a public lecture at the University of Michigan on 27 March 2014, that he has chosen to forgive Kagame, as this is the only way that Rwanda can move past the genocide.Public lecture at University of Michigan, 27 March 2014 4:30-6  Media =Books Rusesabagina's story was first told in Philip Gourevitch's book We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families, which was published in 1998.

After disagreements of a personal nature with J.E.B. Stuart, Jones's brigade was set to guarding supply lines and unavailable during a crucial juncture of the Gettysburg Campaign when Lee suffered from a lack of capable reconnaissance cavalry. As the personality clash between Jones and Stuart escalated, Jones faced charges for impertinence, and was transferred to separate him from Stuart. Jones was killed leading a counter-attack in the 1864 Battle of Piedmont Early life Jones was born in Washington County, Virginia. After graduating from Emory and Henry College in Virginia in 1844, he graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1848, ranking twelfth out of 48 cadets, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Mounted Rifles. He served with the cavalry fighting Indians in the west and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1854. His nickname, \\"Grumble\\", reflects his irritable disposition. His wife was washed from his arms and drowned in a shipwreck shortly after their marriage in 1852 while en route to Texas. He resigned his commission in 1857, and became a farmer near Glade Spring, Virginia. Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Jones joined the 1st Virginia Cavalry Regiment as a captain, commanding a company he had raised. On May 9 he was promoted to major in Virginia's Provisional Army, and later that month both Jones and the regiment were transferred into the Confederate Army. Jones served under Col. J.E.B. Stuart in the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The following month he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was given command of the 1st Virginia Cavalry.Eicher, pp. 325-6. Regular officer Jones put his new volunteers through meticulous training and personally upbraided anyone who was slow to learn how to perform standard drills to their commander's exacting standards.William Edmondson \\"Grumble\\" Jones: The Life of a Cantankerous Confederate (2017) p89, James Buchanan Ballard In the fall of 1861 the Confederate forces underwent a massive reorganization, during which the enlisted men could elect their officers. As a result, Jones was not re- elected to his post as commander of the 1st Virginia Cavalry. That September he was appointed to command the 7th Virginia Cavalry. He led the regiment into Western Virginia, along the Potomac River. In March 1862 Jones was given command of all cavalry in the Valley District.Eicher, p. 326. Confederate Cavalry General William E. Jones photographed while still a colonel with the 7th Virginia Cavalry in 1862. Returning to eastern Virginia, Jones's cavalry was distinguished in the Second Bull Run Campaign; he was wounded in a skirmish at Orange Court House on August 2. He was part of Stuart's ostentatious raid around Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's army preceding the Seven Days battles. Jones had established himself a reputation as a \\"superb outpost officer\\" but had already alienated Stuart who tried to send Robertson off to North Carolina only for him to return, Stuart expressed the opinion that Jones was the most difficult man in the army.Plenty of Blame to go Around: Jeb Stuart's Controversial Ride to Gettysburg. By Eric Wittenberg, J. David Petruzzi 282-3. Despite Stuart's protest, Lee promoted Jones to brigadier general, and assigned to him to command the 4th Brigade of Stuart's Cavalry Division in the Army of Northern Virginia. This brigade was known as Robertson's, or the \\"Laurel brigade,\\" consisted entirely of Virginians; it had performed well while commanded by Turner Ashby though sometimes without tight discipline. Now leading an elite veteran unit, Jones was requested by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson for the Valley District, and he took up the post on December 29, 1862. In the spring of 1863, Jones and Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden raided the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad west of Cumberland, Maryland, destroying much of the railroad and public property in the area, including the Burning Springs Complex on May 9, 1863. Rejoining Stuart, he fought in the largest cavalry engagement of the war, the Battle of Brandy Station, June 9, 1863, at the start of the Gettysburg Campaign. He was surprised, as was all of Stuart's command, to be hit out of blue by Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton. Jones's brigade was outnumbered by the division of his West Point classmate, Brig. Gen. John Buford, but it held its own and ended the fight with more horses and more and better small-arms than at the beginning, capturing two regimental colors, an artillery battery, and about 250 prisoners. Clashes with Jeb Stuart and Gettysburg In one of the huge cavalry parades ordered by Stuart that had attracted the attention of Union forces and led to the Battle of Brandy Station, Jones put an affront on Stuart by disrupting a passing review ceremony for guest of honour Robert E. Lee. Accustomed to good press, Stuart found himself criticised for ordering outrageous pageantry and then failing to maintain Confederate cavalry supremacy in a real battle.William Edmondson \\"Grumble\\" Jones: The Life of a Cantankerous Confederate (2017) p151-5 James Buchanan Ballard To make it worse, Stuart's b√™te noire Jones had been in the thick of the fighting and performed impressively at Brandy Station.William Edmondson \\"Grumble\\" Jones: The Life of a Cantankerous Confederate (2017) p151-5 James Buchanan Ballard By the beginning of the Gettysburg campaign, the function of cavalry was increasingly to be the eyes and ears of an army.S.

Mosby, once a protege of Jones, but now leading his own partisan ranger detachment, had given Stuart optimistic intelligence, which he seized on to propose a showy raid around the Union army.William Edmondson \\"Grumble\\" Jones: The Life of a Cantankerous Confederate (2017) p100 James Buchanan Ballard Lee had twice found similar cavalry probes by Stuart lasting a few days useful, and gave him discretionary orders for a new operation as part of the major offensive into the North..S. Knott, USArmyWarCollege, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrXxz4iniRs Battle of Gettysburg: why J.E.B. Stuart ends up in Carlisle Jones had so estranged Stuart that he chose to sideline the proven cavalry brigade commanded by Jones (and the similar one led by Beverly Robertson who had once been engaged to Stuart's wife) well away from the opportunity to distinguish themselves, either with Stuart or with Lee and the bulk of the army as it maneuvered in enemy territory. This left Lee with a couple of brigades of mounted partisan rangers, and he distrusted these irregulars for the vital work of probing enemy dispositions while screening their own army from the enemy. Lee chose not to use the irregular brigades, and waited for the return of Stuart, but his sweep around the Union army took far longer than anticipated. Confederate blindness to the disposition and movements of Union forces during Stuart's eight day absence was a harbinger of insouciant reconnaissance that was widely thought to have been a major factor in Lee's tactics at the Battle of Gettysburg.S. Knott, USArmyWarCollege, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrXxz4iniRs Battle of Gettysburg: why J.E.B. Stuart ends up in Carlisle Before moving into Pennsylvania, General Robert E. Lee ordered Ewell to capture Harrisburg if practicable. On July 3, Jones's brigade fought a sharp battle with the 6th U.S. Cavalry at Fairfield, Pennsylvania, then again at Funkstown, Maryland, a few days later. The Battle of Culpeper Court House was Jones#s last action under Stuart's command. Stuart, who since Gettysburg had seen his reputation in the South and the Confederate army decline precipitously, court-martialed Jones for insulting him. Robert E. Lee had by this time become aware of the personality clash and intervened to have Jones exonerated and transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department in West Virginia. He recruited a brigade of cavalry there and campaigned in eastern Tennessee with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's forces during the winter and spring of 1864. Final campaign, death In May, Jones assumed command of the Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley who were defending against the halting advance of Maj. Gen. David Hunter towards Lynchburg, Virginia, in the Valley Campaigns of 1864. In the Battle of Piedmont on June 5, 1864, Jones was shot in the head and killed while leading a charge against a superior attacking force. Grumble Jones is buried in the Old Glade Spring Presbyterian Church graveyard, Glade Spring, Virginia. His fellow cavalry general, Brig. Gen. Imboden, wrote that Jones In popular culture The bluegrass band The Dixie Bee-Liners have a biographical ballad about Jones on their 2008 album Ripe (Pinecastle Records) entitled \\"Grumble Jones\\".

Casualties were three killed (two seamen & one boy), and twenty wounded (the boatswain [Clarke], two Midshipmen [Bellairs & Knapman], one Marine [William Parsons] and sixteen sailors), according to the three logs (Captain's log, Ship's log, Master's log). Spartiate returned to her home port of Plymouth for repairs from December 1805 to February 1806. Thereafter she joined the Channel Fleet and, for the next two years, was involved in the blockade of Rochefort.The Captain's log does show that she returned to the United Kingdom for replenishment purposes at the following time periods: 25 July to 3 August 1806, 14 January to 26 February 1807, 29 June to 16 September 1807 In January 1808, she was in Admiral Strachan's squadron, and pursued Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand's flight from Rochefort.

However, SILC nicknames, in contrast to many other protocols (e.g. IRC), are not unique; a user is able to use any nickname, even if one is already in use. The real identification in the protocol is performed by unique Client ID. The SILC protocol uses this to overcome nickname collision, a problem present in many other protocols. All messages sent in a SILC network are binary, allowing them to contain any type of data, including text, video, audio, and other multimedia data. The SKE protocol is used to establish session key and other security parameters for protecting the SILC Packet protocol. The SKE itself is based on the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange algorithm (a form of asymmetric cryptography) and the exchange is protected with digital signatures. The SILC Authentication protocol is performed after successful SKE protocol execution to authenticate a client and/or a server. The authentication may be based on passphrase or on digital signatures, and if successful gives access to the relevant SILC network. The SILC Packet protocol is intended to be a secure binary packet protocol, assuring that the content of each packet (consisting of a packet header and packet payload) is secured and authenticated. The packets are secured using algorithms based on symmetric cryptography and authenticated by using Message Authentication Code algorithm, HMAC. SILC channels (groups) are protected by using symmetric channel keys. It is optionally possible to digitally sign all channel messages. It is also possible to protect messages with a privately generated channel key that has been previously agreed upon by channel members. Private messages between users in a SILC network are protected with session keys. It is, however, possible to execute SKE protocol between two users and use the generated key to protect private messages. Private messages may be optionally digitally signed. When messages are secured with key material generated with the SKE protocol or previously agreed upon key material (for example, passphrases) SILC provides security even when the SILC server may be compromised. History SILC was designed by Pekka Riikonen between 1996 and 1999 and first released in public in summer 2000.SILC history A client and a server were written. Protocol specifications were proposed, but ultimately request for publication was denied in June 2004 by IESGhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-riikonen-silc-spec/history/ and no RFC has been published to date. At present time, there are several clients, the most advanced being the official SILC client and an irssi plugin. SILC protocol is also integrated to the popular Pidgin instant messaging client. Other GUI clients are Silky and Colloquy. The Silky client was put on hold and abandoned on the 18th of July 2007, due to inactivity for several years.SourceForge.net: project closed The latest news on the Silky website was that the client was to be completely rewritten. As of 2008, three SILC protocol implementations have been written. Most SILC clients use libsilc, part of the SILC Toolkit. The SILC Toolkit is dual-licensed and distributed under both the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the revised BSD license.  Security  As described in the SILC FAQ, chats are secured through the generation of symmetric encryption keys. These keys have to be generated somewhere, and this occurs on the server. This means that chats might be compromised, if the server itself is compromised. This is just a version of the man-in-the-middle attack. The solution offered is that chat members generate their own public-private keypair for asymmetric encryption. The private key is shared only by the chat members, and this is done out of band. The public key is used to encrypt messages into the channel. This approach is still open to compromise, if one of the members of the chat should have their private key compromised, or if they should share the key with another, without agreement of the group.  Networks  SILC uses a similar pattern to IRC, in that there is no global \\"SILC network\\" but many small independent networks consisting of one or several servers each, although it is claimed that SILC can scale better with many servers in a single network. The \\"original\\" network is called SILCNet, at the round-robin. However, as of May 2014, it has only one active (though unstable) server out of four. Most SILC networks have shut down due to declining popularity of SILC.

The word \\"Pictured\\" was removed from the title with the 1968 edition.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1988. The encyclopedia is now advertised as Compton's by Britannica.  History  The set was originally published in 1922 in 8 volumes as Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia by F.E. Compton and Company of Chicago. It was titled \\"Pictured\\" because no other encyclopedia at the time had as large or as diverse a collection of illustrations.Kenneth F.

Articles averaged 850 words, or more than a full page. Most of the main articles were not signed and none of the fact entries were. 600 editors, advisors, artists and contributors were listed at the front of Vol. 1.Kister 1986 p.53 Potentially difficult technical terms were italicized and defined in context, and articles used a \\"pyramid structure\\", beginning in simple, elementary terms and gradually becoming more complex and detailed.Kister 1986 p.55 Despite being continuously revised, by the late 1970s it was being criticized for being out of date, particularly with regard to its illustrations. However, in the early 1980s the publishers began a thorough revision under Michael Reed and the contents were brought more up to date. This included a more egalitarian approach to women's roles in society and revisions of articles such as abortion, adoption, Argentina and the Falkland Islands.Kister pp.54, 56-7. Kister notes that the set incorrectly dates Roe v.

It is based on the Ogg container format, with an XML language called CMML (Continuous Media Markup Language) providing additional metadata. It is intended to create a Continuous Media Web (CMWeb), whereby continuous media can be manipulated in a similar manner to text media on the World Wide Web, including searching and dynamic arrangement of elements.  History  The specific design of the elements of the Continuous Media Web project were invented by Silvia Pfeiffer and Conrad Parker at CSIRO Australia in mid-2001. Some of the ideas behind CMML and the generic addressing of temporal offsets were proposed in a 1997 paper by Bill Simpson-Young and Ken Yap. In January 2002 the Annodex team took on two students, Andrew Nesbit and Andre Pang, along with Simon Lai who became the first person to author meaningful content in CMML. During this time the basics of the Annodex technology were designed, including the design of temporal URI fragments, the basic DTDs, the choice of the Ogg encapsulation format and the initial design of the libraries. By late 2004, Andre Pang developed the Annodex Plug-in for Mozilla Firefox Browsers, allowing for the playback of Annodex media encoded with the Ogg Theora video codec and the Ogg Vorbis audio codec. Time URIs implemented at the Location Bar provides the server-side seeking functionality on Annodex media and enables hyperlinking into and out of Annodex media through a table of contents clip list for CMML content. Over time there was increasing development of Annodex technology from the open- source community, starting with Debian packages by Jamie Wilkinson, Python bindings by Ben Leslie, and Perl bindings by Angus Lees. The command-line authoring tools were completed early in 2001, whilst being continually updated to adhere to the current Version 3 of the Annodex annotation standards by 2005.Annodex Annotation Standard Version 3 In November 2005, CSIRO wanted to focus on closed-source research and build existing products on top of the technology, thus losing interest in the open source standard components of it. Therefore, a decision was made to separate out the open-source components into its own organisation by creating an Annodex Foundation similar in spirit to the many other foundations that have been created around other FOSS technologies.Annodex Foundation History  Technology  The core technical specification documents on Annodex are being developed through the Annodex community. They consist of the following components as follows:  CMML  Continuous Media Markup Language is a XML markup language for time-continuous data such as audio and video. The main principles of CMML are as follows: * Enables the description of structure for a media file through marking up temporal clips * Allows attachment of hyperlinks and annotations to the clips. * Used for authoring of Annodex content through the stream tag. = Example of CMML Content = [ Related video on detection of galaxies ](http://www.aao.gov.au/galaxies.anx#radio) ![](galaxy.jpg) What's out there? The origin of the CMML document, along with further documentation and standards can be found at Annodex CMML Standard Version 2.1  Annodex File Format  Annodex File Structure Annodex is an encapsulation format, which interleaves time-continuous data with CMML markup in a streamable manner. The Annodex format is built on the Ogg encapsulation format to allows for internet servers and proxies to manage temporal subparts and reconstruct files from annodexed clips. This introduces the following stream types: * A Skeleton meta-header stream * a CMML annotation stream Further information can be found at Annodex Annotation Format for Time-continuous Bitstreams, Version 3.0  Time intervals in URIs  To include time-continuous content such as audio and video media into the Web, it is necessary to be able to point hyperlinks into such content to address temporal offsets.

It was originally developed by VERITAS Software. Through an OEM agreement, VxFS is used as the primary filesystem of the HP-UX operating system. With on-line defragmentation and resize support turned on via license, it is known as OnlineJFS. It is also supported on AIX, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, SINIX/Reliant UNIX, UnixWare and SCO OpenServer. VxFS was originally developed for AT&T;'s Unix System Laboratories. VxFS is packaged as a part of the Veritas Storage Foundation (which also includes Veritas Volume Manager). History According to the vendor, it was the first commercial journaling file system. That claim can be taken in two ways, i.e., the first implementation of a journaling file system in a commercial context, or the first file system available as an unbundled product. Dan Koren is cited as one of the original developers of VxFS. He notes in a mailing list that they \\"finished release 1.0 one year or so later\\" after starting development of VxFS under a contract with AT&T; Corporation in 1990. Other sources agree that the product was first released in 1991. As the internet was not widely available in the early 1990s, getting a new file system deployed for Unix-like operating systems was more difficult, so the one- to two-year delay in the release and commercialization of this file system was not unusual. Version history The on-disk layout of VxFS is versioned and upgradeable while the file system is mounted. This file system has gone through ten versions. * Version 2 added support for filesets, dynamic inode allocation and ACLs. Layouts 1-3 stopped being supported in VxFS 4.0. * Version 4 added support for storage checkpoints and for Veritas Cluster File System. Version 4 was released in VxFS 3.2.1. Layout version 4 is no longer supported under VxFS 5.1. * Version 5 started support for file systems up to 32 terabytes () in size. Individual files can be up to 2 terabytes in size. Version 5 was introduced in VxFS 3.5 and is no longer supported under VxFS 5.1. * Version 6 added support for file systems and files up to 8 exabytes () in size. Version 6 also introduced support for named streams/resource forks, for multiple underlying volumes, and for file change logs. Version 6 was introduced in VxFS 4.0. * Version 7 extends support for multiple volumes to permit Dynamic Storage Tiering. Dynamic Storage Tiering allows root users to move files among different volumes, allocate files to different volumes at file creation time based on policy, and independently recover volumes, without altering the namespace of the file system. Version 7 was introduced in VxFS 5.0. * Version 8 enables support for file-level snapshots and shared extents. Version 8 was introduced in VxFS 5.1. * Version 9 enables support for file compression, deduplication, and partition directories. Version 9 was introduced in VxFS 6.0. * Version 10 enables support for maxlink, which permits a directory to contain more than 64K subdirectories. Version 10 was introduced in VxFS 6.1. Parallel access mode VxFS file system can run in single instance mode or in a parallel access / cluster mode. The parallel mode allows for multiple servers (also known as cluster nodes) to simultaneously access the same file system. When run in this mode, VxFS is referred to as Veritas Cluster File System. The Cluster File System provides cache coherency and POSIX compliance across nodes, so that data changes are atomically seen by all cluster nodes simultaneously. Because Cluster File System shares the same binaries and same on-disk layout as single instance VxFS, moving between cluster and single instance mode is straightforward.

Effective fitness is used in Evolutionary Computation to understand population dynamics. While a biological fitness function only looks at reproductive success, an effective fitness function tries to encompass things that are needed to be fulfilled for survival on population level. In homogeneous populations, reproductive fitness and effective fitness are equal. When a population moves away from homogeneity a higher effective fitness is reached for the recessive genotype. This advantage will decrease while the population moves toward an equilibrium. The deviation from this equilibrium displays how close the population is to achieving a steady state. When this equilibrium is reached, the maximum effective fitness of the population is achieved. Problem solving with evolutionary computation is realized with a cost function. If cost functions are applied to swarm optimization they are called a fitness function. Strategies like reinforcement learning and NEAT neuroevolution are creating a fitness landscape which describes the reproductive success of cellular automata. The effective fitness function models the number of fit offspring and is used in calculations that include evolutionary processes, such as mutation and crossover, important on the population level. The effective fitness model is superior to its predecessor, the standard reproductive fitness model. It advances in the qualitatively and quantitatively understanding of evolutionary concepts like bloat, self-adaptation, and evolutionary robustness. While reproductive fitness only looks at pure selection, effective fitness describes the flow of a population and natural selection by taking genetic operators into account. A normal fitness function fits to a problem, while an effective fitness function is an assumption if the objective was reached. The difference is important for designing fitness functions with algorithms like novelty search in which the objective of the agents is unknown.In the case of bacteria effective fitness could include production of toxins and rate of mutation of different plasmids, which are mostly stochastically determined  Applications  When evolutionary equations of the studied population dynamics are available, one can algorithmically compute the effective fitness of a given population. Though the perfect effective fitness model is yet to be found, it is already known to be a good framework to the better understanding of the moving of the genotype-phenotype map, population dynamics, and the flow on fitness landscapes. Models using a combination of Darwinian fitness functions and effective functions are better at predicting population trends. Effective models could be used to determine therapeutic outcomes of disease treatment. Other models could determine effective protein engineering and works towards finding novel or heightened biochemistry.

He was privileged as a Court Jew and as a Resident. Thanks to his wealth, privileges as well as social and cultural commitment he was a Jewish dignitary famous in his day in Central and Eastern Europe.  Life = Ancestry and training  Lehmann's father belonged to the Jewish upper class of Westphalia, just like his brother-in-law, the court Jew Leffmann Behrens of Bochum, later established in Hannover. From him, older biographers assume, Berend Lehmann received some business training and then traded in Behrens‚Äô commission. In 1692 he is active together with Leffmann Behrens at the imperial court in Vienna in business transactions to promote Duke Ernst August of Hannover's duchy of Hannover to an electorate.  Young family and own business in Halberstadt  His activity is first documented, as, at age 26, he did business at the Leipzig Trade Fair of 1687, where subsequently he was a regular visitor at the then three annual seasons. He resided in Halberstadt, where, from 1688, he is listed as married to Miriam, daughter of the deceased protected Jew, Joel Alexander. From him he derived his protected status. Two years later his first son, Lehmann Behrend, was born and he built his first, modest abode in the Jewish quarter of Halberstadt (Bakenstra√üe 37, partly existent in the building complex of Little Venice).  Banker to Saxon Elector  In 1694 he became a mint and general business agent to his own sovereign, the Elector of Brandenburg; a year later he was in a banking connection with the Saxon Electoral court at Dresden. In 1697 he was commissioned by the young Elector, Augustus the Strong, to procure money needed for the acquisition of the Polish throne. He received authority to sell or pawn lands situated outside the main territory of Saxony and collected loans worth millions of guilders from Christian and Jewish banking partners, with the help of which the Saxon field marshal Heino Heinrich Graf von Flemming persuaded the majority of the Polish nobility into electing Augustus the Strong King \\"in\\" Poland. In recognition of such services, Augustus made Berend Lehmann \\"Resident of the King of Poland in the Lower Saxon Circle\\". This was some sort of a consul's privilege on which Lehmann repeatedly based his demands, more or less successfully.  Building activities in Halberstadt  So, from Elector Frederic William III of Brandenburg he received the right to buy for himself in Halberstadt, in addition to the modest house he already possessed, a sizable building he thought fitting of his rank. This was an exception, as having a second house was normally forbidden to Jews. When in the extensive garden grounds he had a new building erected for a yeshiva (a Torah-/Talmud academy) as the nucleus of a community campus which was also to accommodate a large new synagogue, he was forbidden to carry on. Before he was able to buy two adjacent houses in addition, the property was confiscated for the newly received French Reformed refugees. The protest of his protector, Augustus the Strong, against the confiscation proved in vain.Strobach:Privilegiert, p. 42  Talmud printed  In the meantime he had achieved a considerable religious feat: When the Dessau court Jew Wulff, who was about to have the Babylonian Talmud printed, ran into financial difficulty, Lehmann took over the project and the printing licence. He \\"had gold flow from his pocket\\", so that within two years, from 1697 to 1699, 2,000 copies of a twelve volume edition could be produced in Frankfurt (Oder). A large part of the work went - free of charge - to poor Jewish communities.  Army contractor  Between 1700 und 1704 Berend Lehmann supplied military equipment for Augustus the Strong in the Northern War against Sweden. Letters from him to an influential courtier at Dresden show him busy acquiring new loans, and anxious over their repayment.Meisl:Hof, pp. 227-252  Community benefactor in Halberstadt  In 1707 his wife, Miriam, died and soon after he remarried, namely Hannle, daughter of a Frankfurt (Main) community superior by the name of Mendel Beer. At this time he built a whole complex of buildings as an extension of his first modest home in Halberstadt. In his building ambitions he was permanently hindered by the Prussian local administration, but promoted by the Berlin Hofcammer, an institution geared to the levying of money for the King. On the new premises, apart from offices and private space for a growing family and team of servants, he kept a warehouse and a wine cellar, and \\"for mercy , so they can perform their divine service\\", sheltered six poor Jewish families. As one of the three parnassim (superiors) of the Halberstadt community of around 1,000 Jews (more than in Berlin), he had the task of \\"repartitioning\\" the extra contributions which King Frederick William I of Prussia (the Soldiers‚Äô King) repeatedly drew from the Jews. He himself shouldered the lion's share.Strobach:Privilegiert, p. 38  Dresden branch  Back in Dresden, he also worked as a mint agent for the Saxon-and-Polish state. Likewise he procured jewels for Augustus the Strong's show collection Gr√ºnes Gew√∂lbe. In 1708, such activities led to the foundation of a Dresden branch of his Halberstadt business, in which his then 18-year-old eldest son, Lehmann Behrend, worked alongside himself and his brother-in-law, Jonas Meyer. Strictly speaking, outside the Leipzig trade fairs the Lehmanns and Meyer were the only protected Jews in all of Saxony. But the large enterprise (proudly residing in the Altes Posthaus at Landhausstra√üe 13) employed and housed up to 70 Jewish employees who were themselves not protected . This above all provoked the anti-Jewish protest of the Saxon estates (among whom the clergy and traders were particularly active), which Augustus the Strong fended off for a longtime but eventually gave in to. In the mid-1720s the sale of merchandise had to stop, while the banking branch continued in a smaller fashion.  Agricultural and Hebrew printing activities in Blankenburg  From Halberstadt he had a business connection with the sovereign of the nearby petty principality of Blankenburg (Harz). In 1717, Prince Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel allowed him to buy landed property there, a privilege otherwise denied to Jews. Lehmann resided in a stately mansion and founded a Hebrew printing office, which was conducted by the printer Israel Abraham from Je√ünitz, but failed for Christian censorship reasons.  Foreign affairs adventure  In 1721 Lehmann went in for a precarious attempt at causing the sovereigns of Prussia and Saxony-Poland to undertake the partition of Poland. Lehmann had outstanding debts there and hoped to be able to cash them in from the future Prussian part of the country. The Habsburg Emperor Charles VI and Czar Peter the Great were also to profit from the partition. Lehmann sought to address the Emperor through the latter's son-in-law, the Blankenburg prince, Louis Rudolph. The Czar, let in on the plan by Prussia, reacted angrily and demanded strict inquiry and punishment of the Jew. Lehmann was spared the worst by Augustus the Strong; he was only granted back the grace of his patron after sacrificing a precious stone to him.Strobach:Privilegiert, p. 110  Financial decline and death  At the same time, he lost a great amount of capital, which was confiscated when his son-in-law, the Hanover court Jew Isaac Behrends, went bankrupt and Lehmann was accused of having illegally held back securities, jewels and money from the estate for him (the allegation was never verified). The Hannover Justizkanzlei (chancellery of justice) wanted him on trial in Hannover, but the Prussian king, Frederick William I, refused the extradition of his Protected Jew, and a heavy dispute continued for years whether Hannover or Lehmann's Prussian domicile of Halberstadt was the legal venue. Meanwhile, Lehmann tried to bring about a settlement with the Behrens' creditors by partly renouncing his own claims and encouraging the other Jewish creditors to do likewise. He also protested in several letters to King George I, who was also the Hannoverian sovereign, against his relatives' five years' imprisonment and ultimate torture (which did not yield the expected confession of the alleged embezzlemement). There were further losses, so that in 1727 Berend Lehmann's own insolvency was declared.Meisl: Hof, 233 The causes of his failure have not yet been researched. Neither is it clear how he, all the same, succeeded in setting up several foundations. One of them was to hold money to facilitate the marriages of poor orphan boys and girls in the Halberstadt community, another was to secure the livelihood of his yeshiva scholars. It served its purpose for the following two centuries. Early in 1730, the margrave of Bayreuth confronted him with a debt claim of 6,000 talers dating back to 1699. It took him some time to borrow the sum in order to have the \\"execution\\" of house arrest lifted. After his death on July 9, 1730, claims of several hundred thousand talers could only partly be satisfied through the auction of most of his real estate. Subsequently, his eldest son, Lehmann Behrend of Dresden, also failed.Strobach: Privilegiert, 61 Lehmann's gravestone, in the oldest Halberstadt Israelitic cemetery, is preserved, and it praises his generosity as a community benefactor and his high reputation in the Christian \\"palaces\\" which enabled him to act as a shtadlan (an advocate) of his correligionists.  Importance  Berend Lehmann ranks among the great court Jews - the Wertheimers and Oppenheimer Vienna, Joseph S√ºss Oppenheimer of Stuttgart, Leffmann Behrends of Hannover, the Rothschilds of Frankfurt on the Main - as one of the most highly respected Jewish personalities in Central and Eastern Europe. His ambition to make an impact on the life of his times made him a baroque figure not unlike his noble Christian contemporaries and it put him in frequent conflict with the Christian authorities trying to curb his efforts. In his charitable and religious generosity he is the model of a wealthy Jew also being a pious leader of his community.  Reception = Saint and hero  Berend Lehmann's later image was first determined by eulogies and legends in the Hebrew and Yiddish chronicles of the community. 150 years later, in the Geschichte der israelitischen Gemeinde Halberstadt (History of the Israelitic Community of Halberstadt, 1866) the then rabbi of the city, Auerbach, passed the old stories on with some scepticism but still with great veneration. He was followed in this mood by another orthodox rabbi, Marcus Lehmann of Mainz, who in his J√ºd. Volksbibliothek (Jewish People's Library) painted Berend Lehmann's life in episodes (largely invented) as a patriarch and active participant in German and Jewish political life. He stressed Lehmann's support of the Polish Jews in their misery. This 19th- century picture of the Royal Resident as a saint and hero has recently been characterized as \\"not necessarily having to do with reality but being an identification offer [...] invented at the writing desks of Auerbach and Marcus Lehmann\\".Raspe: Ruhm, 199  More realism  Twenty years after the two rabbis, Emil Lehmann, a great-great-great-grandson of Berend Lehmann's and a Dresden liberal lawyer and politician, wrote an essay about him, which for the first time used archival evidence. He pointed out the adroitness of his ancestor in the tactics of his fighting, also admiring the foresight with which the Resident had seen to the long-time functioning of his foundations. Though more realistic as a biographer than his predecessors, Emil Lehmann still had the bias of an admiring descendant. At the turn of the 20th century the Dessau rabbi, Max Freudenthal, researched into Lehmann's merits with respect to Hebrew printing. He cleared up the business circumstances of the Talmud edition of 1697 to 1699, especially Lehmann's stressful relationship with the Christian printer, Michael Gottschalk. For the first time he showed Lehmann's tough business acumen. He also described Lehmann's connection with the printer Israel Abraham of K√∂then and Je√ünitz with whom he published several of the works of his Halberstadt yeshiva scholars.  An unbiased approach  A further step in the direction of a historically unbiased evaluation of Berend Lehmann was taken by the Berlin archivist Josef Meisl, the later founder of the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People. In 1924 he edited Lehmann's correspondence from the Baltic battlefields of the Northern War. They show Lehmann's extensive activities as an army contractor and his aspiration to participate in political processes (which Meisl, however, regarded as amateurish).  Selma Stern  A great push came into Lehmann's biography through the historian Selma Stern, who between 1925 and 1962 first dealt with the conditions of Jews in 17th- and 18th-century Prussia and then with court Jews in particular In her collection of documents his activities for the Halberstadt Jews and the Jewish community in general became more concrete. In her court Jew book she ranked him with the Wertheimers and Oppenheimers of Vienna and even with the Rothschilds of Frankfurt. She contrasted him as the \\"genuine\\" court Jew with the less well-reputed Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer of Stuttgart, and thus idealised him.  Anti-semitic setback  The anti-semitism of the National Socialists yielded two contributions about Berend Lehmann, the first, by Peter Deeg (1938), being a caricature of him as the stereotyped \\"usurer\\", the second one, by Heinrich Schnee (1953), a one-sided portrait of him as a profiteer and a clever augmenter of Jewish influence.  New eulogies  In 1970, as a sort of response to these distortions, the French private scholar Pierre Saville published the first monography on the R√©sident Royal. With little new evidence, he strengthened the \\"identification offer\\" r√¥le of Berend Lehmann by painting another heroic picture of him. The American orthodox rabbi, Manfred R. Lehman, did the same in several contributions about his \\"possible ancestor\\".  New Research  Studies from the sources regarding Berend Lehmann were resumed in the first decade of the 21st century by Lucia Raspe and Berndt Strobach.  Traces and memory in Halberstadt = A building complex  In Halberstadt the building complex at Bakenstra√üe Nr. 37, which survived the air raid on the city in 1945 and the subsequent neglect of historic architecture in East Germany, is an impressive document of Lehmann's building activity. In one of its outer walls the remnants of a pedestrian bridge across the river Holtemme (which in its day flowed openly among the houses of the Jewish quarter) testify to his public spirit. He had it built for \\"the benefit of the general public\\".Strobach: Privilegiert, 57  Museum and Academy  The Berend Lehmann Museum, founded in 2001 by the Halberstadt- based Moses Mendelssohn Akademie in two picturesque half-timbered houses (one containing a former mikveh situated in the grounds of the synagogue destroyed in 1938, document the life of the court Jew and the heritage of colourful later Jewish life in the city. There remains a doorway of a richly decorated baroque building near the museum dating from about 1730 which was taken down in 1986 (although it might have been saved), and is locally taken to have been Berend Lehmann‚Äôs Palace, although there is no evidence that it was connected with him.  Former Teaching House  The Klaus (or yeshiva), Rosenwinkel 18, was founded by Lehmann in a house near the synagogue and moved to its present location in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, as a rabbinical academy it became one of the strongholds of neo-orthodox Judaism. It survived Kristallnacht and the 1945 air raid and is now the seat of the Moses Mendelssohn Akademie. The academy offers information on Jewish life in the form of conferences, exhibitions and lectures. Its lecture hall is the former synagogue of the yeshiva.  New religious community attempted  There has been no Jewish religious community in the city since the post-war years when, for a short time, survivors from the concentration camps gathered there.Hartmann: Halberstadt, vol. 5, 14‚Äî15 There is an initiative to establish a new community for a number of Jews from the CIS countries who have settled in Halberstadt .

Biography Joseph H. Pilates was born 9 December 1883 in M√∂nchengladbach, Germany. His father, Heinrich Friedrich Pilates, who was born in Greece, was a metal worker and enthusiastic gymnast, and his German-born mother was a housewife.Eva Rincke, Joseph Pilates, p.14-17. http://www.jillianhessel.com/pilates_biography.html Pilates was a sickly child. He suffered from asthma, rickets, and rheumatic fever, and he dedicated his entire life to improving his physical strength. He was introduced by his father to gymnastics and body-building, and to martial arts like jiu-jitsu and boxing. By the age of 14, he was fit enough to pose for anatomical charts. Pilates came to believe that the \\"modern\\" life-style, bad posture, and inefficient breathing lay at the roots of poor health. He ultimately devised a series of exercises and training techniques, and engineered all the equipment, specifications, and tuning required to teach his methods properly. Pilates was originally a gymnast and bodybuilder, but when he moved to England in 1912, he earned a living as a professional boxer, a circus-performer, and a self-defense trainer at police schools and Scotland Yard. During World War I the British authorities interned him, along with other German citizens, in Lancaster Castle, where he taught wrestling and self-defense, boasting that his students would emerge stronger than they were before their internment. It was there that he began refining and teaching his minimal equipment system of mat exercises that later became \\"Contrology\\". He was then transferred to another internment camp at Knockaloe on the Isle of Man. During that involuntary break, he began to intensively develop his concept of an integrated, comprehensive system of physical exercise, which he himself called \\"Contrology\\". Some of the early use of Pilates's exercise methods included rehabilitation of seriously injured veterans. He studied yoga and the movements of animals and trained his fellow inmates in fitness and exercises. After World War I, he returned to Germany and collaborated with important experts in dance and physical exercise such as Rudolf Laban. In Hamburg, he trained police officers. He immigrated to the United States around 1925. On the ship to America, he met his future wife Clara. The couple founded a studio in New York City and directly taught and supervised their students well into the 1960s. \\"Contrology\\", related to encouraging the use of the mind to control muscles, focusing attention on core postural muscles that help keep the body balanced and provide support for the spine. In particular, Pilates exercises teach awareness of breath and of alignment of the spine, and strengthen the deep torso and abdominal muscles. Joseph and Clara Pilates soon established a devoted following in the local dance and performing-arts community of New York. Well-known dancers such as George Balanchine, who arrived in the United States in 1933, and Martha Graham, who had come to New York in 1923, became devotees and regularly sent their students to the Pilates for training and rehabilitation. His exercise regimen built flexibility, strength and stamina. Soon after it became known that ballerinas were attending the Pilates gym on 8th Avenue, society women followed. One of the ballerinas was Romana Kryzanowska, who become Pilates' protege. Kryzanowska started Pilates at the age of 16 following an ankle injury. Pilates said of her, \\"she's a natural\\". Kryzanowska was named a helper and started teaching Pilates alongside Pilates and his wife. Toward the end of his life, Pilates named Kryzanowska as the director of The Pilates Studio. Kryzanowska and her daughter continued to operate Pilates' original studio. Jay Grimes believes that nobody knows Joseph Pilates‚Äô work better than Kryzanowska. Joseph Pilates wrote several books, including Return to Life through Contrology and Your Health, and he was also a prolific inventor, with over 26 patents cited. Joe and Clara had a number of disciples who continued to teach variations of his method or, in some cases, focused exclusively on preserving the method and the instructor-training techniques they had learned during their studies with Joe and Clara. In 1967, Joseph Pilates died in New York of advanced emphysema, aged 83.  Books * * Your Health by Joseph H. Pilates (1934) * Return to Life Through Contrology by Joseph H. Pilates and William J.

She took part in all the major actions of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars under a series of distinguished captains. In 1794 she fought at the Glorious First of June under Captain John Thomas Duckworth. In early 1795, Captain James Saumarez was appointed in command. Under Saumarez, Orion took part in the defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of Groix off Lorient on 22 June. In early 1797 she was sent to join the Mediterranean Fleet and distinguished herself at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 14 February. She then took part in the blockade of Cadiz from March 1797 to April 1798, when she was sent into the Mediterranean as part of a small squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson. In August, Nelson finally caught up with the French fleet, resulting in the Battle of the Nile, where Captain Saumarez was wounded. Between 31 March 1801 and 10 July 1802 the Surgeon's First Mate on board the Orion was Henry Plowman.

The novel expands upon the social and mathematical foundations on which Flatland is based. It is markedly different from the first novel in that it has a more prosaic ending and treatment of society. Plot summary The Circles (who are appointed as priests/leaders of Flatland due to their many sides, or an appearance thereof) do not take A Square's revelation about a third dimension to be accurate, and A Square is ostracized by his community. Then after some time, society becomes more open to the ideas of Spaceland and, overall, to change and advancement. However, when a prominent surveyor finds a Triangle with more than 180 degrees, he is fired from his job and generally considered a crackpot, since such a construction is not possible in Euclidean geometry. He eventually makes friends with the grandson of A Square, A Hexagon, because he is a mathematician and scientist. Together, they come upon a theory to explain the unusual measurements: they actually live on a very large sphere, and the Triangles have more than 180 degrees due to being inscribed on a non-planar surface. With help from the sphere from the first novel, they are able to prove this theory. However, the established scientific community is not able to comprehend the idea proposed by the two, and thus they do not attempt to enlighten Flatland. Furthermore, as the residents of Flatland advance, they begin to travel in space; they see distant worlds like their own, and the surveyor tries to find the distance between their world and these distant worlds, using trigonometry and radar. From his calculations, he and the hexagon determine that the universe is expanding; again they try to reveal this theory to the outside world, but again it is not accepted. Therefore, like his grandfather in the previous novel, the hexagon writes a book that is not to be opened until the theory of the expanding universe is discovered and accepted by others. Then they live an inferior existence without any more contact with the sphere. Adaptations and parodies In 2012 the creators of Flatland: The Movie released an educational sequel film, Flatland 2: Sphereland based in part on Burger's Sphereland that dealt with the topics of curved spaces, symmetry and congruence, an expanding universe, and the multiverse.

In Memoriam;Frances Hamerstrom, 1907-1998 The Auk 116(4):1122-1124, 1999. Hamerstrom was a prolific writer, publishing over 100 professional papers and 10 books on the prairie chicken, harriers, eagles, and other wildlife topics. Some were translated into German.  Biography  Frances Flint was born in 1907 into a wealthy family in Boston, Massachusetts. As a youth, she attended Milton Academy. As a child Hamerstrom developed a fascination with the natural world. Despite her parents' complaints that such behavior was \\"unladylike\\", she kept wild pets, learned to hunt, and tended her own gardens. To keep her family from uncovering evidence of her wildlife adventures, she planted poison ivy along the path that led to where she kept her wilderness gear. (Hamerstrom was naturally immune to its effects). Hamerstrom attended Smith College but proudly flunked out. She was disinterested in classes and felt she could learn more from the natural world than in a classroom. She met her husband, Frederick Hamerstrom (also a naturalist at heart), at a dance. Shortly after, in 1931, they married in secret. Later they remarried in a ceremony in Massachusetts. Hamerstrom and her husband wanted to work with wildlife, at a time when the modern wildlife management and research profession was in its infancy. After meeting wildlife conservationist and ecologist Aldo Leopold, the Hamerstroms went to Iowa State University to study under Paul Errington. In 1935, Frances earned her Bachelor's Degree from Iowa State University, where she also worked on the topic of predation and the food habits of the great horned owl. After graduating, Frances and Frederick moved to Wisconsin to work at a wildlife refuge and to attend graduate school at the University of Wisconsin under Aldo Leopold. Frances was Leopold's only female graduate student. She earned her Master's degree in wildlife management in 1940. During this time, the Hamerstroms both began their research on the imperiled greater prairie chicken, an endangered species in Wisconsin.Rosenfield, Robert N. In Memoriam Retrieved 2006-06-12 Research Greater prairie chicken In 1949, Frances became the second woman to work as a wildlife professional in Wisconsin. The Hamerstroms both worked for the Department of Natural Resources in Wisconsin. Their lifetime study of the endangered prairie chicken, in a research area that included the Buena Vista and Leola Marshes, was their major contribution to the field. The Hamerstroms focused on the habitat needs of the greater prairie chicken. They developed and initiated a management plan based on their observation that the prairie chicken required a \\"checkerboard\\" pattern of habitat. Frances worked for the Department of Natural Resources for 23 years, and in 1970 the Hamerstroms were awarded with the National Wildlife Federation Award for Distinguished Service to Conservation for their innovative management plan and work with the prairie chickens. The Hamerstroms helped focus public attention on the need for habitat preservation. In 1961 they helped form the \\"Society of Tympanuchus Cupido Pinnatus\\" (Latin term for prairie grouse) to purchase lands (a total of more than 2,000 acres) to be managed for the preservation and restoration of \\"native prairie grouse populations.\\"STCP: A Brief History of STCP. Retrieved December 27, 2017. Through her fund-raising campaigns, grasslands near their home sheltered more than 2,000 greater prairie chickens. The Hamerstroms are credited by naturalists for saving the prairie chicken from extirpation in Wisconsin. Over the years, an estimated 7,000 wildlife observers (called \\"boomers\\") participated in the collection of necessary data for this project, with Frances playing host to all of them at her home.1992 Notable Authors: Frances Hamerstrom.

She wrote Harrier: Hawk of the Marshes, published in 1986 by the Smithsonian Institution Press, with illustrations by her husband. It documented the relationship between the breeding success of harriers and the vole population, which constituted their cyclical food supply. Frances noted that the vole abundance determined the harriers' mating system, and documented her findings in a 1985 article \\" \\" which earned the Edwards Prize for best paper of that year. Frances Hamerstrom was also a licensed falconer. She studied American kestrels and the use of nest boxes as a management tool for kestrels, and banded thousands of raptors in Wisconsin and in other parts of North America during her many travels. She contributed to the book, Peregrine Falcon Populations: Their Biology and Decline (1998).GRIN:Hamerstrom Wildlife author As a writer, Frances provided insight into academic science for general readers. She wrote over 100 different technical articles and 12 different books, including several popular children's books.

Her secret for pie crusts was the use of bear lard. Her readers occasionally sent her bear lard gained from their own kills. Wildfoods Cookbook: From the Fields and Forests of the Great Lakes States was published in 1994, when she was 84, and illustrated by her daughter, Elva Hamerstrom.Wildfoods Cookbook Library of Congress. Retrieved 2006-06-14. By training hundreds of research assistants (nicknamed \\"gabboons\\") and by writing formal scientific papers and informal books, Hamerstrom and her husband inspired many generations of future naturalists. Home life The Hamerstroms lived in an 1850s-era, Plainfield, Wisconsin home. Never completed, it lacked running water and was heated by wood-burning stoves. Originally designed as a stage coach stop and community center, the structure had an incomplete ballroom on the second floor. The Hamerstroms used it as a storage area for specimens and data collected from their field research over many years. The Hamerstroms raised two children, Alan and Elva, in their home. Hamerstrom life was far from ordinary. Fran confided to a friend who visited the house years later that \\"we had all the luxuries (such as a first-rate ornithological library) and none of the necessities\\". Frederick and Frances were married for 59 years, until he died from pancreatic cancer in 1990. She was an atheist.Dan Barker (2011). The Good Atheist: Living a Purpose-Filled Life Without God. Ulysses Press. p. 176. . Speaking of her 55-year marriage to Frederick Hamerstrom (a nephew of Charles Darwin), Fran quipped: \\"You'll notice that our 'pair bond' has lasted fairly well and I think it's because we're both remarkably tolerant people. He's an agnostic and I'm an atheist, and we've put up with each other all this time!\\" Later years Following her husband's death, Frances visited Saudi Arabia, Africa, and South America. On an expedition in Peru, at age 86 Hamerstrom broke her hip and was evacuated by helicopter. She returned to the area the following year to observe hunting practices on a tributary of the Amazon River. Frances Hamerstrom died at a Port Edwards, Wisconsin nursing home August 29, 1998. She was 90. Legacy and honors * In 1961, Frances Hamerstrom received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Carroll University (then, Carroll College). *In 1970, both the Hamerstroms received the National Wildlife Reservation Award. *In 1992, Frances Hamerstrom received the Notable Wisconsin Authors Award from the Wisconsin Library Association. * In 1996, both the Hamerstroms were inducted into the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame.Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame: Frederick Hamerstrom, Frances Hamerstrom Inducted, 1996 Retrieved 2009-06-14. * The Prairie Grouse Technical Council and the Raptor Research Foundation offer lifetime achievement awards in the name of Frances and Frederick Hamerstrom.

In 1836, when President Andrew Jackson's veto of the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States took effect, he issued the Specie Circular, an executive order that all public lands had to be purchased with hard money. A hard money policy is one in which the government recognizes currency which is based on an actual, fixed item which is considered valuable. Hard money is considered the opposite of fiat money, which is currency that takes its value from the government declaration or law which assigns the said value to it. As such, this kind of money is not inherently valuable, but may be used in transactions as long as it is said to be legal tender. The use of fiat money is now more common than the use of hard money, especially on an international level. The US dollar, for instance, is an example of a fiat currency. Bentonian currency In the US, hard money is sometimes referred to as Bentonian, after Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who was an advocate for the hard money policies of Andrew Jackson. In Benton's view, fiat currency favored rich urban Easterners at the expense of the small farmers and tradespeople of the West. He proposed a law requiring payment for federal land in hard currency only, which was defeated in Congress but later enshrined in an executive order, the Specie Circular.

Like the current U.S. flag, the Grand Union Flag has 13 alternating red and white stripes, representative of the Thirteen Colonies. The upper inner corner, or canton, featured the flag of the Kingdom of Great Britain, the country of which the colonies were the subjects. History A replica flag flying outside San Francisco City Hall, San Francisco, California \\"First National Flag\\", School Text: \\"A Brief History of the United States\\", 1880 The design for the flag was based in part on the red ensign then used by British colonies. By the end of 1775, during the first year of the American Revolutionary War, the Second Continental Congress operated as a de facto war government authorizing the creation of the Continental Army, the Continental Navy, and even a small contingent of Continental Marines. A new flag was needed to represent the Congress and the United Colonies with a banner distinct from the British Red Ensign flown from civilian and merchant vessels, the White Ensign of the British Royal Navy, and the British union flags carried on land by the British army. The emerging states had been using their own independent flags, with Massachusetts using the Taunton Flag, and New York using the George Rex Flag, prior to the adoption of united colors. Americans first hoisted the Colors on the colonial warship , in the harbor on the western shore of the Delaware River at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 3, 1775, by newly appointed Lieutenant John Paul Jones of the formative Continental Navy. The event had been documented in letters to Congress and in eyewitness accounts. The flag was used by the Continental Army forces as both a naval ensign and garrison flag throughout 1776 and early 1777. It is not known for certain when or by whom the design of the Continental Colors was created, but the flag could easily be produced by sewing white stripes onto the British Red Ensigns. The \\"Alfred\\" flag has been credited to Margaret Manny. It was widely believed that the flag was raised by George Washington's army on New Year's Day, 1776, at Prospect Hill in Charlestown (now part of Somerville), near his headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts, (across the Charles River to the north from Boston), which was then surrounding and laying siege to the British forces then occupying the city, and that the flag was interpreted by British military observers in the city under commanding General Thomas Gage, as a sign of surrender. Some scholars dispute the traditional account and conclude that the flag raised at Prospect Hill was probably a British union flag, though subsequent research supports the contrary. The flag has had several names, at least five of which have been popularly remembered. The more recent moniker, \\"Grand Union Flag\\", was first applied in the 19th-century Reconstruction era by George Henry Preble, in his 1872 History of the American Flag. The design of the Colors is strikingly similar to the flag of the British East India Company (EIC). Indeed, certain EIC designs in use since 1707 (when the canton was changed from the flag of England to that of the Kingdom of Great Britain) were nearly identical, but the number of stripes varied from 9 to 15. That EIC flags could be well have been known by the American colonists has been the basis of a theory of the origin of the national flag's design. Vexillologist Nick Groom proposed the theory that the Grand Union was adopted by George Washington's army as a protest against the rule of the British Parliament but a profession of continued loyalty towards King George III. Groom argues that the inclusion of the Union Jack in the canton of the Grand Union is evidence of this sentiment. The Grand Union became obsolete following the passing of the Flag Act of 1777 by the Continental Congress which authorized a new official national flag of a design similar to that of the Colors, with thirteen stars (representing the thirteen States) on a field of blue replacing the British Union Flag in the canton. The resolution describes only \\"a new constellation\\" for the arrangement of the white stars in the blue canton so a number of designs were later interpreted and made with a circle of equal stars, another circle with one star in the center, and various designs of even or alternate horizontal rows of stars, even the \\"Bennington flag\\" from Bennington, Vermont which had the number \\"76\\" surmounted by an arch of 13 stars, later also becoming known in 1976 as the \\"Bicentennial Flag\\". The combined crosses in the British Union flag symbolized the union of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland. The symbolism of a union of equal parts was retained in the new U.S. flag, as described in the Flag Resolution of June 14, 1777 (later celebrated in U.S. culture and history as \\"Flag Day\\"). In fiction Versions of the Grand Union Flag in alternate histories may be modified so that the Union Jack in the canton also represents Ireland. In some alternate history fictions set in realities where the American Revolutionary War was either averted or won by Great Britain, the Grand Union Flag has been depicted as the flag of a North American nation within the British Empire. In For Want of a Nail by Robert Sobel, it serves as the flag of the Confederation of North America, a self-governing dominion created in 1843 via the second of two Britannic Designs after John Burgoyne's victory at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, resulting in the Conciliationists gaining control of the Continental Congress in 1778. In The Two Georges by Harry Turtledove and Richard Dreyfuss, it serves as the flag for the North American Union and is commonly referred to as the 'Jack and Stripes'. A modified version of the flag used by the separatist Independence Party and the nativist terrorist organisation the Sons of Liberty replaces the Union Jack with a bald eagle on a blue field. In the Sliders episode Prince of Wails, set in a reality where the American Revolution was successfully suppressed, it serves as the flag of the British States of America, a heavily-taxed and dictatorially-governed corner of the British Empire (albeit without the knowledge of the King, Harold III).

The henge is a modern adaptation, inspired by the many stone circles and henges scattered around the world. Stonehenge Aotearoa is designed specifically for its location in Wairarapa region of New Zealand's North Island. Astronomer Richard Hall wanted to create an astronomical park and a learning centre for astronomy, geology and sciences in a dark sky site. He founded The Phoenix Astronomy Society who first built two observatories and equipped them with telescopes. The society applied to the Science and Technology Promotion Fund of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MORST), which was administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand to build the henge. The purpose of the grant was to interest people in science who normally would not be interested. It was a community project for the Phoenix Astronomical Society. Thousands of hours of volunteering by around 150 members of the Phoenix Astronomical Society made the construction possible. The henge, built over 2 years, was opened on 12 February 2005 by Nobel Laureate Professor Alan MacDiarmid. View of the causeway that runs from the East to the centre of the henge. It contains 24 pillars and is in diameter and about high. The pillars are capped with lintels, completing the circle, and a -tall obelisk is near the centre of the henge.http://www.stonehenge-aotearoa.co.nz/about- stonehenge.html From the obelisk, along the meridian line is a 10-metres area called the analemma. The henge is similar to the sarsen cycle of the original Stonehenge and has the same diameter. Entry is via a causeway, which runs due west to the centre. Ten metres outside the circle of the henge stand six heel stones of varying heights. The modern henge was designed to demonstrate how ancient peoples used such constructions to understand astronomy and also to explain basic astronomical ideas. Visitors are inspired to continue learning both about knowledge that was essential to their ancestors' survival and recent scientific developments. Stonehenge Aotearoa was also designed to explain the concept of the star compass, like the one used by the Polynesian Navigators. The pillars are not equidistant and their placement reveals important navigational and seasonal stars. Stonehenge Aotearoa also differs from its Salisbury cousin in construction; the pillars, lintels and central obelisk are not hewn stone, but are hollow structures with concrete moulding forming their exterior. If you stand at the centre of the henge, the pillars and lintels appear to form doorways. These frame the rising points of the Sun, the Moon, and bright stars that are either important seasonal markers or navigational beacons.  Equinoxes, solstices and Matariki  As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the north and south poles are alternately tilted towards the Sun. The Sun's altitude therefore increases and decreases during the year, producing seasons. Stonehenge Aotearoa's six heel stones mark the place where the Sun is rising and setting at solstices and equinoxes. This sculpture marks the place of the heliacal rising of Matariki around winter solstice at Stonehenge Aotearoa. Stonehenge Aotearoa has various sculptures placed around the structure. The stone sculpture \\"the Fingers of Mother Earth\\" marks the place where the heliacal rising of Matariki can be observed around the winter solstice in June.

He is best known as front man of Sir Henry and his Butlers and for numerous contributions to the Danish qualifier for the Eurovision song contest, the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, which he won three times. He was the father of songwriter/producer Nicolai Seebach and singer/songwriter/producer Rasmus Seebach. Biography=Musical beginnings Seebach began his musical career as an organist in his own group \\"The Colours\\" at age 14. In the following years he played in many pop and beat groups. He played the piano with various orchestras and groups, sometimes going under the name of \\"Boogie-Woogie-Tommy\\". He gained mainstream popularity in Denmark in 1965, when he became a member of the band Sir Henry and his Butlers, writing many of their most popular hits. He also worked as a recording engineer at the Rosenberg Studio in Copenhagen and amongst other projects recorded the legendary Icecross album there in 1973.icecross.net: Icecross album credits . Solo career In 1976 he emerged as a successful solo artist. His hit album \\"Tommygum\\" was released in 1977. At the same time he was in high demand as a producer at his record company EMI, where he was involved in projects for artists such as Lecia & Lucienne. It was at this time that he recorded and performed \\"Apache\\". Eurovision Song Contest Seebach competed seven times in the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. Only one other act, the Hot Eyes, has ever won the competition three times. In 1979, his song \\"Disco Tango\\", coauthored with Keld Heick, and performed by Seebach, came in as no 1. Finishing 6th at the Eurovision Song Contest 1979, it became a major hit both in Denmark and other European countries. A friendship with fellow contenders \\"Black Lace\\" (UK entry) led to Tommy, producing the single \\"Hey Hey Jock McCray\\" for the band, released the following year in Denmark by EMI. In 1980, his song \\"Bye-Bye\\", performed by the duo Lecia & Lucienne, came in 7th. In 1981, he won the competition once again, in a duet with Debbie Cameron. The song \\"Kr√∏ller eller ej\\", was also coauthored with Keld Heick. Translated as \\"Straight or Curly Hair\\", it finished 11th at Eurovision Song Contest 1981. Cameron has later alleged that Denmark and Israel had been among countries whose sound checks had been sabotaged in order to bring The UK's Bucks Fizz to victory. In 1982, his song \\"Hip hurra det‚Äô min f√∏dselsdag\\" (\\"Hip hip hurray, this is my birthday\\"), performed by himself, came in second. In 1984, \\"Pyjamas for to\\" (\\"Pyjamas for two\\") came in fourth. In 1985, \\"Det‚Äô det jeg altid har sagt\\" (\\"I always said this\\") came in second. In 1987, \\"Det‚Äô gratis\\" came in fourth. In 1993, Seebach won the competition again, performing the song \\"Under stjernerne p√• himlen\\" (\\"Under the stars of the sky\\"), written together with Keld Heick. He had submitted the song several times before, but had been turned down. At the time, the public interest in the Song Contest, deemed cheesy by the cultural elite, was fading, and as an icon of the contest, Seebach's popularity had been on the wane for some time. It has been alleged that Danmarks Radio had originally turned the song down out of fear that Seebach, who had developed a severe addiction to alcohol, would cause a scandal at the performance. When the song came in as a secure no. 1, his popularity soared for a while, but only to drop dramatically, when the song finished 22nd out of 25 songs at Eurovision Song Contest 1993, receiving only 9 points. The poor result meant that Denmark did not qualify for the ESC 1994, and Seebach was widely criticized, after experiencing a brief rise in popularity, and never competed again. He had a big hit in 1989 with the duet \\"Du sk√¶lder mig hele tiden ud\\" (\\"You're Always Yelling at Me\\"), sung with Annette Heick, Keld Heick's daughter. They followed up this success with two more singles and a Christmas album. After the Eurovision Song Contest The 1990s were lean years for him as a performer and recording artist. He had a comeback with the release of a disco-version of \\"Kr√∏ller eller ej\\" released in 1999, as well as the release of a compilation album. He toured the country's discoth√®ques at that time and found cult interest in his old hits among a new, younger audience. Personal life Seebach was married for many years to Karen Seebach; they had three children, Nicolai Seebach, Rasmus Seebach and Marie. The marriage broke down when Seebach developed a serious addiction to alcohol. His son Rasmus after becoming a pop singer, wrote a song about him called \\"Den jeg er\\" (\\"Who I am\\"), stating what a major influence his father had in his life in spite of his addiction. He died at the age of 53 at the amusement park Bakken, where he had been head of musical entertainment for several years. Although he had managed to overcome his alcoholism at the time, the cause of his death, a heart attack, was ascribed to his previous addiction. The documentary Tommy 2010 saw the launch of Tommy, director Sami Saif's documentary on Seebach's life. Featuring many of Seebach's private videos, as well as television clips and interviews with his widow, children and colleagues in the industry, it documents his public performances and private life, focusing both on his successes and his personal demise. Tommy received four stars out of six by Politiken, Berlingske Tidende and Ekstra Bladet; B.T. awarded it six stars out of six. Dagbladet Information described it as \\"... a story of an artist who became a victim of the musical genre which he himself had helped innovate, and who, instead of gaining the broad recognition he had longed for his entire life, ended up with a status somewhere in between national heritage and kitsch clown...\\" Politiken called the film \\"worthy, worth seeing and moving\\", Ekstra Bladet \\"a moving portrait of a man caught between the music, his family and the bottle\\".

Background The Republic of Texas was formed in 1836. As the Texas Revolution continued, the papers that documented the workings of the interim government accompanied government officials as they evacuated to various towns to stay in front of the Mexican Army. After the war ended in April, Columbia became the nation's capital city, and the archives were located there. The center of government and the archives were then moved to Houston. President Mirabeau B. Lamar moved the archives to Austin In 1839, Mirabeau B. Lamar became President of Texas. Under his influence, the Texas Congress authorized the establishment of a planned city to serve as the seat of government. The new city, Austin, was at the edge of the frontier, near several hostile native tribes, with no easy way to get supplies. Proponents of the move predicted that when the rest of the nation was settled, Austin would be the population center. The opposition, led by former president Sam Houston, wanted the government to remain near the current population center, along the Gulf Coast. The nation's archives were moved to Austin between August 26 and October 14, 1839. Fifty wagons were used. Lamar and his cabinet arrived on October 17. Over the next several years, Comanches staged several raids near Austin. Citizens in the Houston area and the Houston Morning Star editorial board used these as evidence to support their argument that the capital and the archives should be returned to Houston. Sam Houston was elected president again in September 1841. His margin of victory was so large he assumed a mandate to implement his priorities, including moving the capital. Congress continued to reject proposals to move the archives. Prelude President Sam Houston supported moving the archives Congress adjourned in February 1842. The following month, Mexican troops under General Rafael V√°squez invaded Texas. By March 5, over 1,000 Mexican soldiers were camped in San Antonio. Several days later, a committee of vigilance in Austin recommended martial law and ordered residents to evacuate. A small number of people remained. President Houston returned to the city that bore his name. V√°squez retreated after a few days. Sam Houston may not have known of this; on March 10, he ordered George Washington Hockley, Secretary of War, to move the archives to Houston. As justification, he cited part of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas which stated \\"The president and heads of departments shall keep their offices at the seat of government, unless removed by the permission of Congress, or unless, in case of emergency in time of war, the public interest may require their removal.\\" Colonel Henry Jones, the military commander in Austin, convened a group of citizens to discuss Houston's order. Public sentiment was that Austin was safe, and that Houston's departure had created a lack of confidence in the city, which had resulted in devalued real estate. On March 16, the committee of vigilance resolved that removing the archives was against the law. They formed a patrol at Bastrop to search every wagon and seize any government records found. Sam Houston's private secretary, W.D. Miller, wrote him that Austin residents \\"would much rather take their rifles to prevent a removal [of the archives] than to fight Mexicans\\". To resolve the issue, the president called a special session of Congress, which convened in Houston on June 27, 1842. Congress took no action to move the capital. Conflict In September 1842, General Ari√°n Woll led another Mexican expedition into Texas and temporarily captured San Antonio. Houston convened the Seventh Texas Congress at Washington-on-the-Brazos. In his introductory remarks, Houston demanded that Congress support the removal of the archives, over the protests of the \\"seditious\\" citizens of Austin, asserting that \\"as to the propriety and necessity of the act no reasonable doubt could exist\\". On December 9, Senator Greer proposed \\"A Bill to provide for the safety of the National Archives\\". The vote to suspend the rules to allow the bill to pass quickly resulted in a tie; Senate president Edward Burleson, who did not like Sam Houston, cast the deciding vote against the bill. Undeterred, on December 10, Greer introduced another bill to move the General Land Office. He left blank the name of the city to which the office should be moved, resulting in weeks of debate as to which city should be so honored. On December 10, Houston privately tasked Colonel Thomas I. Smith and Captain Eli Chandler with moving the nation's archives to Washington-on-the-Brazos Houston wrote, \\"The importance of removing the public archives and government stores from their present dangerous situation at the City of Austin to a place of security, is becoming daily more and more imperative. While they remain where they are, no one knows the hour when they may be utterly destroyed.\\" The men were encouraged to raise a small troop on the premise of conducting an excursion against the native tribes, then quickly secure the archives and transport them. Smith led over 20 men and 3 wagons into Austin the morning of December 30, 1842. The men were almost finished loading the wagons with papers when they were noticed by Angelina Eberly, the owner of a nearby boarding house. Eberly ran to Congress Avenue, where a six-pound howitzer was situated. She turned the small cannon toward the General Land Office and fired it. Although some shot hit the General Land Office, there was no real damage and no one was injured. Smith and his men left quickly, headed northeast to avoid the men patrolling the road through Bastrop. They were accompanied by two clerks from the General Land Office, who were tasked with ensuring the General Land Office records were not harmed or modified. Their progress was slow; a downpour made roads almost impassable for the already slow-moving oxen. The group managed to travel before stopping for the night at Kinney's Fort along Brushy Creek. In Walnut Creek (north of Austin) some of Houston's agents were surpassed by angry citizens who then recovered some of the stolen documents and returned them to Austin. In Austin, Captain Mark Lewis gathered a group of men to retrieve the archives. Some of the pursuers had no horses, and some had little or no weaponry. Lewis's men reached Smith's encampment in the middle of the night. They were undetected, as Smith had neglected to post guards. On the morning of December 31, the records were returned to Austin. It is uncertain as to whether Smith's men took them back or if the Austin group took custody of the records and transported them. Aftermath Bronze statue of Angelina Eberly firing the a six-pound cannon The Texas House of Representatives formed a committee to investigate the attempted transferral of the archives. The committee admonished President Houston for his actions in trying to move the capital from Austin without the approval of Congress. A Senate committee reported that they did not agree that Austin should be the capital, but without an immediate threat to the city, Houston had no legal reason to move the records. In 1843, the Senate voted that the archives should be moved if there was not peace with Mexico. The vote was again tied, but this time Burleson cast his deciding vote in favor of the bill. The Texas House rejected it. The Senate also issued a resolution encouraging Houston to move the governmental agencies back to Austin. Nevertheless, the legislature and government offices continued to run from Washington-on-the-Brazos. Former president Lamar received a letter in March 1843 that said the town of Austin was almost deserted; most businesses were closed, but the archives were still present. On July 4, 1845, a convention met in Austin to consider the annexation of Texas to the United States. At that time, the governmental records created in Washington-on-the-Brazos were transferred to Austin, creating a single archive. A bronze statue of Angelina Eberly was placed on Congress Avenue in downtown Austin in the summer of 2004.

He served in the army of the Confederate States of America, fighting in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign and played a prominent role in the Battle of Gettysburg. Despite starting the Gettysburg Campaign commanding a brigade, Pettigrew took over command of his division after the division's original commander Henry Heth was wounded. In this role, Pettigrew was one of three division commanders in the disastrous assault known as Pickett's Charge on the final day of Gettysburg. He was badly wounded during the assault and was later mortally wounded during a Union attack while the Confederates retreated to Virginia near Falling Waters, West Virginia, dying several days later. Early years Pettigrew circa 1855 Johnston Pettigrew was born at his family's estate \\"Bonarva\\" in Tyrrell County, North Carolina on July 4, 1828. His father was from a wealthy family of French Huguenot background.Tagg, p. 343. One of Pettigrew's cousins, John Gibbon, would later become a major general for the Union during the Civil War. Pettigrew enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of 15. Pettigrew is reported to have performed well in his studies, as well as in boxing and fencing. He earned praise for his achievements from President James K. Polk, who appointed him an assistant professor at the United States Naval Observatory. Pettigrew studied law, traveled to Europe, and eventually moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he worked in the legal field with his uncle, James Louis Petigru. He was also an author, writing a book about the culture of Spain titled Notes on Spain and the Spaniards in the Summer of 1859, With a Glance at Sardinia. Returning to the United States, Pettigrew was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1856. Despite his education and legal experience, Pettigrew leaned toward the military as a way to serve his country and his state. In December 1860, he was serving as an aide to the governor of South Carolina and the following April participated in the negotiations between the governor's office, the South Carolina military authorities, and the Union commander of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Civil War When war began, Pettigrew joined the Hampton Legion, a force raised in South Carolina by Wade Hampton, as a private, although he quickly accepted a commission as colonel of the 1st South Carolina Rifle Militia Regiment. Pettigrew was later assigned to command the 12th (later renamed the 22nd) North Carolina Infantry. Confederate President Jefferson Davis urged him to accept higher command, but he declined because of his lack of military experience. Despite this inexperience, Pettigrew was promoted to brigadier general by Jefferson Davis during the lead-up to the Peninsula Campaign. Peninsula Campaign During the Peninsula Campaign in the summer of 1862, Pettigrew was severely wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines. He was hit by a Mini√© ball that damaged his throat, windpipe, and shoulder. Pettigrew nearly bled to death, and while lying wounded, he received another bullet wound in the arm and was bayoneted in the right leg. Pettigrew was left for dead on the field, as his wounds were believed to be mortal. However, he recovered consciousness as a Union prisoner of war.Hess, pp. 38-40. Exchanged two months later, the general recovered from his wounds, spent the fall commanding a brigade in Maj. Gen. Daniel Harvey Hill's division around Richmond, and in the winter commanded a brigade in North Carolina and southern Virginia. He returned to his North Carolina brigade just in time to begin the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863. Gettysburg Campaign Bronze plaque commemorating the site of Pettigrew's death near Bunker Hill, West Virginia The Confederate War Department had assigned Pettigrew's Brigade to Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, and Pettigrew traveled northward to join Lee's army. Pettigrew's brigade, along with the brigades of James Jay Archer, John M. Brockenbrough, and Joseph R. Davis, was assigned to Major General Henry Heth's division of Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill's Third Corps. Both Heth's division and Hill's corps were new organizations, having been created as part of Lee's reorganization following the death of Stonewall Jackson. Pettigrew's Brigade was the strongest in Heth's division. Freshly uniformed and armed with rifles from state military depots, his regiments presented a fine military appearance during the march through Maryland and Pennsylvania. Some of his regimental officers were also members of the North Carolina planter \\"aristocracy\\", including Colonel Collett Leventhorpe leading the 11th North Carolina Infantry and twenty-one-year-old Harry Burgwyn at the head of the 26th North Carolina Regiment, the largest Confederate regiment at Gettysburg. Not having been in serious combat for nearly a year, his brigade mustered a strength over 2,500 officers and men.Busey & Martin, p. 286. Pettigrew's Brigade tangled with the Iron Brigade on July 1, 1863, at the McPherson and Herbst farms to the west of Gettysburg, where all four of his regiments suffered devastating losses--over 40 percent--but were successful in driving the Union forces off of McPherson's Ridge. That afternoon, General Heth suffered a head wound that kept him out of action, and Pettigrew took over command of the battered division. On July 3, 1863, Gen. Lee selected Pettigrew's division to march at the left of Maj. Gen. George Pickett's in the famous infantry assault popularly known as Pickett's Charge (sometimes called the \\"Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault\\", as Pickett's division was not the only one to participate in the charge). Pettigrew's old brigade, now commanded by James K. Marshall, had been roughly handled on the first day of the battle, and was not in good condition for the charge. Pettigrew's division ran into a heavy fire from Union general Alexander Hays' division, which was posted on Cemetery Ridge. Birkett Fry, now commanding James Archer's brigade was wounded, Marshall was killed. Pettigrew's division suffered heavy casualties and were unable to break Hays' line. The division was driven off, and Pettigrew had his horse shot out from under him, requiring him to lead his division on foot. Pettigrew also suffered a painful arm wound. During the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg, Pettigrew remained in command until Heth recovered. Stopped by the flooded Potomac River at Falling Waters, West Virginia, Pettigrew's brigade (temporarily combined with Archer's former brigade) was deployed as a rear guard unit. Union cavalry probed the southern defenses throughout the night as Lee's army crossed the pontoon bridges into West Virginia. On the morning of July 14, 1863, Pettigrew's brigade was one of the last Confederate units still north of the Potomac River when the Union attacked his position. On foot and in the front line, Pettigrew was directing his soldiers when he was shot by a Union cavalryman from the Michigan Brigade at close range, the bullet striking him in the abdomen. He was immediately carried to the rear and across the Potomac, having refused to be left in federal hands. He died three days later at Edgewood Manor plantation near Bunker Hill, West Virginia. His brigade, which lost an estimated 56% casualties, had been ruined as an effective combat organization.Gottfried, p. 606. Legacy Tyrrell County Confederate Monument noting the death of General J. Johnston Pettigrew An official day of mourning was held for him in North Carolina. His death also affected Lee, who remarked: \\"The army has lost a brave soldier and the Confederacy an accomplished officer.\\"Official Records, Series 1, Vol. 27, Part 3, page 1016. General Pettigrew's body was returned to North Carolina and interred at his family estate, \\"Bonarva\\", which is now part of Pettigrew State Park in Washington and Tyrrell Counties. General James Johnston Pettigrew Camp #1401 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Lenoir, North Carolina, was named for the fallen officer. In 1912, a building on the campus of the University of North Carolina was named for Pettigrew.

AMI was designed, built and is operated by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group. AMI was designed, primarily, for the study of galaxy clusters by observing secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) arising from the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel'dovich (SZ) effect. Both arrays are used to observe radiation with frequencies between 12 and 18 GHz, and have very similar system designs. The telescopes are used to observe both previously known galaxy clusters, in an attempt to determine, for example, their masses and temperatures, and to carry out surveys, in order to locate previously undiscovered clusters. AMI Large Array AMI Large Array AMI Large Array in June 2014 The AMI Large Array (AMI LA) is composed of eight 12.8-metre-diameter, equatorially mounted parabolic antennas, which were previously part of the Ryle Telescope. The antennas are separated by distances ranging between 18 and 110 m. The telescope has an angular resolution of approximately 30 arcseconds. The LA is used to image the radio sources (mainly radio galaxies) that contaminate the Small Array observations of the CMB. The LA is being used to carry out the Tenth Cambridge Survey of radio sources. The first results from the survey were used to extend the measured 15-GHz source counts to sub-millijansky levels; this is an order of magnitude deeper than achieved by the Ninth Cambridge Survey, which was the first survey of significant sky coverage at a comparable radio frequency. AMI Small Array AMI Small Array AMI Small Array in June 2014 The AMI Small Array (AMI SA) consists of 10 3.7-m-diameter antennas, similar in design to those of the LA. They are arranged at intervals of between 5 and 20 m. The SA has an angular resolution of approximately 3 arcminutes and is used to image, at high resolution, the galaxy clusters of interest. The SA is being used to search for previously unknown galaxy clusters; results from the first such cluster, detected using AMI, were released in December 2010. In addition to observations of galaxy clusters, the SA has been used to carry out observations, amongst other things, towards supernova remnants and anomalous microwave emission.

He was the son of Sydney Smith Lee, a captain in the Confederate States Navy, and the nephew of General Robert E. Lee. Early life Lee was born at Clermont in Fairfax County, Virginia.

Graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1856, Lee was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (later redesignated the 5th Cavalry Regiment), which was commanded by Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, and in which his uncle, Robert E. Lee, was lieutenant colonel. As a cavalry subaltern, he distinguished himself by his gallant conduct in actions against the Comanches in Texas, and was severely wounded in a fight in Nescutunga, Texas, in May 1859. In May 1860, he was appointed instructor of cavalry tactics at West Point, but resigned his commission upon the secession of Virginia. American Civil War Lee joined the Confederate States Army as a lieutenant of cavalry and served at first as a staff officer to Brig. Gen. Richard Stoddert Ewell at the First Battle of Manassas. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 1st Virginia Cavalry in September 1861, serving under Colonel James Ewell Brown \\"J.E.B.\\" Stuart. Lee became colonel of the regiment in March 1862 and was promoted to brigadier general on July 24, 1862. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Lee received notoriety by arriving late for a concentration of cavalry, which allowed Federal cavalry to raid Stuart's headquarters and capture his famous plumed hat and cape. However, during the subsequent Confederate raid on Catlett's Station, he captured the headquarters tent and dress uniform of Union Maj. Gen. John Pope. Lee gave Pope's coat to Stuart as compensation for the hat he had lost. Lee performed well in the Maryland Campaign of 1862, covering the Confederate infantry's withdrawal from South Mountain, delaying the Union Army advance to Sharpsburg, Maryland, before the Battle of Sharpsburg around Antietam Creek, and covering his army's recrossing of the Potomac River into Virginia. Stuart's cavalry made its second ride around the Union Army in the Chambersburg Raid before returning in time to screen Robert E. Lee's movement towards Fredericksburg where the cavalry defended the extreme right of the Confederate line. Fitzhugh Lee conducted the cavalry action of Kelly's Ford (March 17, 1863) with skill and success, where his 400 troopers captured 150 men and horses with a loss of only 14 men. In the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Lee's reconnaissance found that the Union Army's right flank was \\"in the air\\", which allowed the successful flanking attack by Maj. Gen. Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, a movement led by Lee's cavalry. Lee during the American Civil War After Chancellorsville, Lee was incapacitated by inflammatory rheumatism, missing a month of action, which included the significant cavalry operations at the Battle of Brandy Station. He recovered in time to lead a brigade in Jeb Stuart's third ride around the Union Army, in the early days of the Gettysburg Campaign, with his most significant contribution being at the Battle of Carlisle. During the Battle of Gettysburg, his brigade fought unsuccessfully in the action at East Cavalry Field. Stuart's report singled out no officer in his command for praise except Fitz Lee, who he said was \\"one of the finest cavalry leaders on the continent, and richly [entitled] to promotion.\\"Tagg, Larry (1998). The Generals of Gettysburg. Campbell, California: Savas Publishing. p. 364. . During the withdrawal from Gettysburg, Lee's brigade held the fords at Shepherdstown to prevent the Union army from following across the Potomac River. Lee was promoted to major general on August 3, 1863, and continued to serve under Maj. Gen. Stuart's command, despite Stuart not receiving promotion following his questionable conduct in the Gettysburg Campaign. While his uncle maneuvered the Army of Northern Virginia back into central Virginia, Lee's division launched a successful ambush on Union cavalry at the Battle of Buckland Mills that fall. In the Overland Campaign the following spring, Lee was constantly employed as a divisional commander under Stuart. Following the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee's cavalry division played a pivotal role in impeding the Union Army in its race to the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. During the fighting at Spotsylvania, Gen. Stuart was detached from the army for the purpose of thwarting Union cavalry commander Phillip Sheridan's raid on Richmond. Stuart took Fitzhugh Lee's division with him. The mission ultimately ended in the mortal wounding of Gen. Stuart at the Battle of Yellow Tavern and Lee's inability to break through the United States Colored Troops' defense of Fort PocahontasFort Pocahontas (2) at FortWiki.com in Charles City County and Fort Powhatan in Prince George County. After Stuart's death, Lee served under Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton. Hampton, who had been Lee's peer for much of the war, was promoted to replace Stuart due to his seniority and greater level of experience; some observers at the time had cynically expected Robert E. Lee's nephew to receive the command. At the Battle of Trevillian Station, Hampton's cavalry prevented Gen. Sheridan's cavalry from aiding General David Hunter's force in western Virginia, where it was certain to have inflicted great damage on General Robert E. Lee's supply and communication lines. The battle also served to screen Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early's move from Richmond to aid Lynchburg, which Hunter was set to besiege. Hampton's cavalry corps shadowed Sheridan's return to Petersburg. Lee subsequently joined Early for his campaign against Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley, and at Third Winchester (September 19, 1864) three horses were shot under him and he was severely wounded. When General Hampton was sent to assist General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina, the command of the whole of Robert E. Lee's cavalry devolved upon Fitzhugh Lee on March 29, 1865, but the surrender at Appomattox followed quickly upon the opening of the campaign. Fitzhugh Lee himself led the last charge of the Confederates on April 9 that year at Farmville, Virginia. Later life After the war, Lee devoted himself to farming in Stafford County, Virginia, and was conspicuous in his efforts to reconcile the Southern people to the issue of the war, which he regarded as a final settlement of the questions at issue. In 1875, he attended the Battle of Bunker Hill centennial at Boston and delivered a remarkable address. In 1885, he was a member of the board of visitors of West Point, and from 1886 to 1890 was governor of Virginia having defeated in 1885 Republican John Sergeant Wise with 52.77% of the vote. Lee commanded the third division at both of President Grover Cleveland's inaugural parades in 1885 and 1893.\\"Gen. Lee to Command: He Will Head a Division in the Inaugural Parade\\". The New York Times. February 19, 1893. Retrieved: July 8, 2008 In April 1896, Lee was appointed consul- general at Havana by President Cleveland, with duties of a diplomatic and military character added to the usual consular business. In this post (in which he was retained by President William McKinley until 1898) he was from the first called upon to deal with a situation of great difficulty, which culminated with the destruction of the warship . Upon the declaration of war between Spain and the United States, he re-entered the army. He was one of four ex-Confederate general officers who were made major generals of United States Volunteers (the others being Matthew Butler, Joseph Wheeler and Thomas L. Rosser). Fitzhugh Lee commanded the 7th Army Corps, but took no part in the actual operations in Cuba. He was military governor of Havana and Pinar del R√≠o in 1899, subsequently commanded the Department of the Missouri, and retired in 1901 as a brigadier general, U.S. Army. Lee was an early leader of the committee for the Jamestown Exposition, which would be held after his death at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads in 1907. Lee died in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. Lee wrote the article about Robert E. Lee in the Great Commanders series (1894), General Lee, a wartime biography (1894), and Cuba's Struggle Against Spain (1899).

However, Augusta County voters selected three other men in 1853, although Imboden again was the third highest vote-getter and returned to the legislature in 1855, this time alongside Boliver Christian and Adam McChesney. Imboden again failed to win re-election in 1857.Cynthia M. Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 443, 448, 459 In response to John Brown's Raid at Harper's Ferry, Imboden helped found the Staunton Light Artillery, partially funding it as his own expense.Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography (1915) available online at ancestry.com His younger brother George W. Imboden had followed his path into the law and also joined the artillery militia. Despite his lack of formal military training, J.D. Imboden was commissioned as captain in the Staunton Artillery of the Virginia State Militia on November 28, 1859.Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and David L. Bongard. The Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography. New York: HarperCollins, 1992, p. 363. . John Daniel Imboden in military uniform Secession and Civil War As the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 appeared ready to pass the ordinance of secession, ex-Governor Henry Wise called a meeting of several militia commanders, Capt. A.M. Barbour (former civil superintendent of the Harper's Ferry Arsenal) and Richmond Enquirer editor Nat Tyler, to plan to capture the U.S. Army arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Imboden attended, as did Capt. John A. Harman of Staunton's infantry militia, as well as cavalry militia captains Turner and Richard Ashby of Fauquier County and Oliver R. Funsten of Clarke County.http://www.angelfire.com/va3/valleywar/battle/61campaign.html Imboden telegraphed Staunton's militia companies to meet in Staunton at 4p.m. on April 17th for orders. The group arranged railroad transportation to Charles Town about 8 miles from the Harpers Ferry arsenal. However, Governor John Letcher refused to authorized the action until the secession ordinance passed. As soon as it did, A.M. Barbour went to Harpers Ferry and publicly informed the workmen. Then, the evening after the secession ordinance passed, 360 men started out to capture the arsenal, defended by U.S. Army Lt. Roger Jones with 50 soldiers and about 15 volunteers. Vastly outnumbered, they attempted to set fire to the buildings and equipment as they retreated north to Carlisle, Pennsylvania.https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/harpers-ferry- armory-and-arsenal.htm Imboden's artillery had set up on the heights above the arsenel, but did not see further action, although Imboden later bragged about converting some of the captured horse carts to caissons. Virginia militia Major General Kenton Harper (of Staunton) then secured the towns, and on April 27, Major Stonewall Jackson arrived to organize the militia into regiments.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Harpers_Ferry_During_the_Civil_War#start_entry On July 1, 1861, the Staunton Light Artillery, with its four bronze, 6-pounder guns and 107 officers and men, was formally mustered in the Confederate States Army.Staunton Artillery, First Bull RunVirginia Light Artillery (Staunton Artillery), National Park Service While commanding his artillery battery at the First Battle of Bull Run, Imboden perforated his left eardrum firing an artillery piece, causing subsequent deafness in that ear. He fought with Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in the Valley Campaign at Cross Keys and Port Republic. On September 9, 1862, Imboden left the artillery to recruit a battalion of partisan rangers and was promoted to colonel of the 62nd Virginia Mounted Infantry (1st Partisan Rangers). He was promoted to brigadier general on January 28, 1863.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001, p. 363. . Upset by the independence movement in West Virginia, the voters of which petitioned to separate from Virginia, Imboden with Brig. Gen. William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones led 3,400 partisan rangers into northwestern Virginia. The Jones-Imboden Raid destroyed rail track and bridges of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, as well as captured thousands of horses and heads of cattle and ruined petroleum fields in the Kanawha Valley. The raiders covered in 37 days but failed to stop West Virginia's statehood. Imboden's actions before Battle of Gettysburg In the Gettysburg Campaign, Imboden's brigade served under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart guarding the left flank for Gen. Robert E. Lee's movement north through the Shenandoah Valley.The West Virginia Encyclopedia (2006, West Virginia Humanities COuncil p. 359 (His brigade did not participate in Stuart's foray away from Lee's army, but instead raided the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad between Martinsburg, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland.) During the Battle of Gettysburg, Imboden's men stayed in the rear and guarded ammunition and supply trains in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. During the Confederate retreat, Imboden escorted the wagon trains with thousands of wounded soldiers back to Virginia. On July 6, 1863, the Potomac River flooding at Williamsport, Maryland, trapped Imboden's wagon train. He put together a defensive force that included an artillery battery and as many of the wounded who could operate muskets. This hastily organized force turned back attacks from Union cavalry generals John Buford and Judson Kilpatrick, saving the wagon train. Robert E. Lee praised Imboden for the way in which he \\"gallantly repulsed\\" the Union cavalry. Returning to the Shenandoah Valley, Imboden responded to a request from General Lee to distract the enemy in his front by leading a raid on the vulnerable Union detachment at Charles Town, West Virginia, on October 18, 1863 at the Battle of Charlestown. Imboden reported, Union Brig. Gen. Jeremiah Cutler Sullivan soon sent a rescue column from nearby Harpers Ferry and drove Imboden back up the valley. Sullivan reported, \\"The cavalry came up with the enemy this side of Charlestown, and drove them through the town. Artillery coming up, drove them about 4 miles. A portion of infantry force ... , reaching them, the enemy were driven from every position they took, to near Berryville.\\" Imboden and John C. Breckinridge's forces defeated Union Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel's command at the Battle of New Market on May 15, 1864. He returned to Virginia and commanded a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert Ransom's cavalry division of the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, including the losses at the Battle of Fisher's Hill and the Battle of Cedar Creek. Incapacitated by typhoid fever by the autumn of 1864, Imboden left the active cavalry service. Beginning on January 2, 1865, Imboden commanded Camp Millen, Georgia, then the prison camp at Aiken, South Carolina as well as other prison camps in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi throughout 1865 until the end of the war. He was paroled in Augusta, Georgia on May 3 of that year. Postbellum After the war, Imboden moved to Richmond, Virginia, where he resumed his work as a lawyer, serving first in Richmond and then in Abingdon, the county seat of Washington County. His brother George moved to West Virginia, where he invested in land and coal, becoming a prominent businessman and legislator. John Imboden also advocated development of Virginia's natural resources and transportation infrastructure. In 1872 he published The Coal and Iron Resources of Virginia: Their Extent, Commercial Value, and Early Development Considered.Imboden, John D.

Around 1875, he moved to southwestern Virginia where he hoped to mine coal and iron ore deposits. He founded the town of Damascus, Virginia, which became a lumber center in the late 19th and early 20th century.Brief History of Damascus, Virginia John D. Imboden also participated in Confederate veterans activities and the Lost Cause movement. He published several articles and books about the Civil War, and also contributed to The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies (128 vols., 1880-1901).The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Cornell University Library In 1876, he became a commissioner of the Centennial International Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in 1893, he was a commissioner of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In the winter of 1879-1880, Imboden traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to meet with potential investors for coal operations in Wise County, Virginia. He persuaded the investors to begin operations with the region, leading to the chartering of the Tinsalia Coal Company, and later the Virginia Coal & Iron Company. Imboden then worked as a land agent for the company, securing property and mineral rights. One of the coal camps in Wise County, Imboden, is named after him. Death and legacy Imboden died in Damascus in 1895, and is buried in the Generals section of Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.John D. Imboden's Obituary, Staunton Vindicator, 23 August 23, 1895.John D.

Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. The data used to build the final model usually comes from multiple datasets. In particular, three datasets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model. The model is initially fit on a training dataset, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a neural net or a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training dataset using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training dataset often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training dataset and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training dataset. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation. Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second dataset called the validation dataset. The validation dataset provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units (layers and layer widths) in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation dataset increases, as this is a sign of overfitting to the training dataset). This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun. Finally, the test dataset is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset. If the data in the test dataset has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test dataset is also called a holdout dataset.  Training dataset  A training dataset is a dataset of examples used during the learning process and is used to fit the parameters (e.g., weights) of, for example, a classifier.Ripley, B.D. (1996) Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 354\\"Subject: What are the population, sample, training set, design set, validation set, and test set?\\", Neural Network FAQ, part 1 of 7: Introduction (txt), comp.ai.neural-nets, Sarle, W.S., ed. (1997, last modified 2002-05-17) Most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit the data, meaning that they can identify and exploit apparent relationships in the training data that do not hold in general.  Validation dataset  A validation dataset is a dataset of examples used to tune the hyperparameters (i.e. the architecture) of a classifier. It is sometimes also called the development set or the \\"dev set\\". An example of a hyperparameter for artificial neural networks includes the number of hidden units in each layer. It, as well as the testing set (as mentioned above), should follow the same probability distribution as the training dataset. In order to avoid overfitting, when any classification parameter needs to be adjusted, it is necessary to have a validation dataset in addition to the training and test datasets. For example, if the most suitable classifier for the problem is sought, the training dataset is used to train the candidate algorithms, the validation dataset is used to compare their performances and decide which one to take and, finally, the test dataset is used to obtain the performance characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and so on. The validation dataset functions as a hybrid: it is training data used for testing, but neither as part of the low-level training nor as part of the final testing. The basic process of using a validation dataset for model selection (as part of training dataset, validation dataset, and test dataset) is:Bishop, C.M. (1995), Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 372 An application of this process is in early stopping, where the candidate models are successive iterations of the same network, and training stops when the error on the validation set grows, choosing the previous model (the one with minimum error).  Test dataset  A test dataset is a dataset that is independent of the training dataset, but that follows the same probability distribution as the training dataset. If a model fit to the training dataset also fits the test dataset well, minimal overfitting has taken place (see figure below). A better fitting of the training dataset as opposed to the test dataset usually points to overfitting. A test set is therefore a set of examples used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a fully specified classifier. MSE of the fit shown in orange is 4 whereas the MSE for the fit shown in green is 9. In the test set, the MSE for the fit shown in orange is 15 and the MSE for the fit shown in green is 13. The orange curve severely overfits the training data, since its MSE increases by almost a factor of four when comparing the test set to the training set. The green curve overfits the training data much less, as its MSE increases by less than a factor of 2.  Holdout dataset  Part of the original dataset can be set aside and used as a test set: this is known as the holdout method.  Confusion in terminology  The terms test set and validation set are sometimes used in a way that flips their meaning in both industry and academia. In the erroneous usage, \\"test set\\" becomes the development set, and \\"validation set\\" is the independent set used to evaluate the performance of a fully specified classifier. > The literature on machine learning often reverses the meaning of > ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù and ‚Äútest‚Äù sets. This is the most blatant example of the > terminological confusion that pervades artificial intelligence research.  Cross-validation  A dataset can be repeatedly split into a training dataset and a validation dataset: this is known as cross-validation. These repeated partitions can be done in various ways, such as dividing into 2 equal datasets and using them as training/validation, and then validation/training, or repeatedly selecting a random subset as a validation dataset. To validate the model performance, sometimes an additional test dataset that was held out from cross-validation is used.  Hierarchical classification  Another example of parameter adjustment is hierarchical classification (sometimes referred to as instance space decomposition), which splits a complete multi- class problem into a set of smaller classification problems. It serves for learning more accurate concepts due to simpler classification boundaries in subtasks and individual feature selection procedures for subtasks. When doing classification decomposition, the central choice is the order of combination of smaller classification steps, called the classification path. Depending on the application, it can be derived from the confusion matrix and, uncovering the reasons for typical errors and finding ways to prevent the system make those in the future. For example,Sidorova, J., Badia, T. \\"ESEDA: tool for enhanced speech emotion detection and analysis\\". The 4th International Conference on Automated Solutions for Cross Media Content and Multi-Channel Distribution (AXMEDIS 2008). Florence, November, 17-19, pp. 257‚Äì260. IEEE press. on the validation set one can see which classes are most frequently mutually confused by the system and then the instance space decomposition is done as follows: firstly, the classification is done among well recognizable classes, and the difficult to separate classes are treated as a single joint class, and finally, as a second classification step the joint class is classified into the two initially mutually confused classes.

The parish stretches east to The Wash, its villages and hamlets including Dawsmere, Gedney Broadgate, Gedney Drove End, Gedney Dyke, Gedney Marsh, and the geographic extension of Gedney Church End.\\"Gedney Parish Council: Villages\\", lincolnshire.gov.uk. Retrieved 7 August 2011 History A hospital for five paupers, (St Thomas Martyr), was founded at Gedney, date unknown, and served from North Creake. It was dissolved around 1339. The redundant railway station was on the former east-west Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. It closed in 1959. The Red House wind farm was built in 2006 with six MM82 wind turbines, its 12MW of power feeding 6,500 homes. Geography Gedney Marsh Wind Farm Gedney and its parish lies on reclaimed fenland, making it one of the most intensive crop-growing areas in the UK. To the west, the parish begins at the eastern end of the Fleet Hargate bypass, and includes the village's campsite and a few houses, bordering the parish of Fleet. The boundary passes close to the west of Gedney Dyke, and meets the parish of Holbeach. It passes just to the west of Gedney Dyke Farm then follows Fleet Haven, near to the wind farm to the west of nearby Red House Farm. It deviates to the east from Fleet Haven and passes to the west of (another) Red House Farm then rejoins Fleet Haven just south of Wards Farm. Fleet Haven runs out of land and meets the sea wall. In the parish, and close to the east is the base of RAF Holbeach which is accessed via Durham's Road. The parish extends out on the mud flats along Fleet Haven Outfall. To access the part of the parish along the start of The Wash would be extremely foolish and is out of bounds due to the bombing range. The limit of the parish finishes between Gat Sea End and Old South Middle. There are observation towers on the sea wall for the bombing range. The control tower is on the sea wall towards Dawsmere and Gedney Drove End. Dawsmere Creek extends out towards The Wash. The boundary with Lutton is along Boatmere Creek then extends out to sea along Tycho Wing's Channel, which is the outflow of the River Nene. This area is the far west of The Wash NNR. The boundary passes to the north of Lodge Farm, broadly following Boatmere Creek, south of Boat Mere Farm then along The Chase. It crosses Roman Bank at Sutton Corner, passing to the west of Lutton. It follows Docking's Holt Lane to the west of Long Sutton, meeting the B1359 at the Garnsgate Road junction. It follows the B1359 (former A17) to the west, then crosses the A17 then follows a drain and Garnsgate Road where it borders Long Sutton and partly follows National Cycle Route 1. It passes to the north of Moorswood Farm, then follows Benderslough Drove and then the South Holland Main Drain, where it borders Sutton St James to the south. At Leedsgate Bridge, west of Inley Drove Farm, it meets the parish of Fleet. North of Leedsgate Bridge, the parish follows Fleet Drain, to the left of Rookery Farm, and it crosses the B1165 and the Little South Holland Drain at Raven's Gate Bridge. The boundary follows Fleet Drain north-eastwards alongside Raven's Drove. The two sides of the boundary are respectively known as Fleet Fen and Gedney Fen. Fleet Drain also follows Delph Bank. To the east of Fleet Drain at this point is Gedney Broadgate. Church Gedney Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. Originating in the 13th century, additions and alterations carried-on into the 17th. It was considerably restored in 1890 however the spire to the tower was unfinished and left as a stump. The tower, to its parapet, has Early English lower stages and Perpendicular upper. The nave arcades and the chancel are of Decorated style. During the rebuilding of the south aisle in 1890 a brass of a female (ca. 1390), with a puppy at her feet, was discovered. Also in the south aisle is a damaged 13th-century effigy of a cross-legged knight, conjectured to represent Falco D'Oyry,Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 413 and Jacobean alabaster monuments of Adlard Welby, his wife Cassandra and their five children, erected in 1605.

Intuitively, IVs are used when an explanatory variable of interest is correlated with the error term, in which case ordinary least squares and ANOVA give biased results. A valid instrument induces changes in the explanatory variable but has no independent effect on the dependent variable, allowing a researcher to uncover the causal effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Instrumental variable methods allow for consistent estimation when the explanatory variables (covariates) are correlated with the error terms in a regression model. Such correlation may occur when: # changes in the dependent variable change the value of at least one of the covariates (\\"reverse\\" causation), # there are omitted variables that affect both the dependent and independent variables, or # the covariates are subject to non- random measurement error. Explanatory variables that suffer from one or more of these issues in the context of a regression are sometimes referred to as endogenous. In this situation, ordinary least squares produces biased and inconsistent estimates. However, if an instrument is available, consistent estimates may still be obtained. An instrument is a variable that does not itself belong in the explanatory equation but is correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, conditionally on the value of other covariates. In linear models, there are two main requirements for using IVs: * The instrument must be correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, conditionally on the other covariates. If this correlation is strong, then the instrument is said to have a strong first stage. A weak correlation may provide misleading inferences about parameter estimates and standard errors.https://www.stata.com/meeting/5nasug/wiv.pdf * The instrument cannot be correlated with the error term in the explanatory equation, conditionally on the other covariates. In other words, the instrument cannot suffer from the same problem as the original predicting variable. If this condition is met, then the instrument is said to satisfy the exclusion restriction. Introduction The concept of instrumental variables was first derived by Philip G. Wright, possibly in co-authorship with his son Sewall Wright, in the context of simultaneous equations in his 1928 book The Tariff on Animal and Vegetable Oils. In 1945, Olav Reiers√∏l applied the same approach in the context of errors-in-variables models in his dissertation, giving the method its name. While the ideas behind IV extend to a broad class of models, a very common context for IV is in linear regression. Traditionally, an instrumental variable is defined as a variable Z that is correlated with the independent variable X and uncorrelated with the \\"error term\\" U in the linear equation : Y = X \\\\beta + U Y is a vector. X is a matrix, usually with a column of ones and perhaps with additional columns for other covariates. Consider how an instrument allows \\\\beta to be recovered. Recall that OLS solves for \\\\widehat{\\\\beta } such that \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,\\\\widehat{U}) = 0 (when we minimize the sum of squared errors, \\\\min_{\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}} (Y-\\\\widehat{\\\\beta} X)'(Y-\\\\widehat{\\\\beta} X) , the first-order condition is exactly X' (Y-\\\\widehat{\\\\beta} X) = X' \\\\widehat{U} = 0 .) If the true model is believed to have \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,U) eq 0 due to any of the reasons listed above‚Äîfor example, if there is an omitted variable which affects both X and Y separately‚Äîthen this OLS procedure will not yield the causal impact of X on Y. OLS will simply pick the parameter that makes the resulting errors appear uncorrelated with X. Consider for simplicity the single-variable case. Suppose we are considering a regression with one variable and a constant (perhaps no other covariates are necessary, or perhaps we have partialed out any other relevant covariates): :y=\\\\alpha + \\\\beta x + u In this case, the coefficient on the regressor of interest is given by \\\\widehat{\\\\beta }= \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x,y)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)} . Substituting for y gives : \\\\begin{align} \\\\widehat{\\\\beta} & = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x,y)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x,\\\\alpha + \\\\beta x + u)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)} [6pt] & =\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x, \\\\alpha +\\\\beta x)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)} +\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x,u)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)}= \\\\beta^* + \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(x,u)}{\\\\operatorname{var}(x)}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\beta^* is what the estimated coefficient vector would be if x were not correlated with u. In this case, it can be shown that \\\\beta^* is an unbiased estimator of \\\\beta . If \\\\operatorname{cov}(x,u) eq 0 in the underlying model that we believe, then OLS gives a coefficient which does not reflect the underlying causal effect of interest. IV helps to fix this problem by identifying the parameters \\\\vec{\\\\beta} not based on whether x is uncorrelated with u, but based on whether another variable z is uncorrelated with u. If theory suggests that z is related to x (the first stage) but uncorrelated with u (the exclusion restriction), then IV may identify the causal parameter of interest where OLS fails. Because there are multiple specific ways of using and deriving IV estimators even in just the linear case (IV, 2SLS, GMM), we save further discussion for the Estimation section below. Example Informally, in attempting to estimate the causal effect of some variable X on another Y, an instrument is a third variable Z which affects Y only through its effect on X. For example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of smoking on general health. Correlation between health and smoking does not imply that smoking causes poor health because other variables, such as depression, may affect both health and smoking, or because health may affect smoking. It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. The researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on smoking. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that smoking causes changes in health. Angrist and Krueger (2001) present a survey of the history and uses of instrumental variable techniques. Graphical definition Of course, IV techniques have been developed among a much broader class of non-linear models. General definitions of instrumental variables, using counterfactual and graphical formalism, were given by Pearl (2000; p. 248). The graphical definition requires that Z satisfy the following conditions: : (Z \\\\perp!!!\\\\perp Y)_{G_{\\\\overline{X}}} \\\\qquad(Z ot!!{\\\\perp!!!\\\\perp} X)_G where \\\\perp!!!\\\\perp stands for d-separation and G_{\\\\overline{X}} stands for the graph in which all arrows entering X are cut off. The counterfactual definition requires that Z satisfies : (Z \\\\perp!!!\\\\perp Y_x)\\\\qquad (Z ot!!{\\\\perp!!!\\\\perp} X) where Yx stands for the value that Y would attain had X been x and \\\\perp!!!\\\\perp stands for independence. If there are additional covariates W then the above definitions are modified so that Z qualifies as an instrument if the given criteria hold conditional on W. The essence of Pearl's definition is: # The equations of interest are \\"structural,\\" not \\"regression\\". # The error term U stands for all exogenous factors that affect Y when X is held constant. # The instrument Z should be independent of U. # The instrument Z should not affect Y when X is held constant (exclusion restriction). # The instrument Z should not be independent of X. These conditions do not rely on specific functional form of the equations and are applicable therefore to nonlinear equations, where U can be non-additive (see Non-parametric analysis). They are also applicable to a system of multiple equations, in which X (and other factors) affect Y through several intermediate variables. An instrumental variable need not be a cause of X; a proxy of such cause may also be used, if it satisfies conditions 1-5. The exclusion restriction (condition 4) is redundant; it follows from conditions 2 and 3. Selecting suitable instruments Since U is unobserved, the requirement that Z be independent of U cannot be inferred from data and must instead be determined from the model structure, i.e., the data- generating process. Causal graphs are a representation of this structure, and the graphical definition given above can be used to quickly determine whether a variable Z qualifies as an instrumental variable given a set of covariates W. To see how, consider the following example. File:Instrumental Variable Example Effect of Tutoring 1.pngFigure 1: Proximity qualifies as an instrumental variable given Library Hours File:Instrumental Variable Example Effect of Tutoring (Edge Deleted)_2.pngFigure 2: G_{\\\\overline{X}}, which is used to determine whether Proximity is an instrumental variable. File:Instrumental Variable Example Effect of Tutoring 2.pngFigure 3: Proximity does not qualify as an instrumental variable given Library Hours File:Instrumental Variable Example Effect of Tutoring 3.pngFigure 4: Proximity qualifies as an instrumental variable, as long as we do not include Library Hours as a covariate. Suppose that we wish to estimate the effect of a university tutoring program on grade point average (GPA). The relationship between attending the tutoring program and GPA may be confounded by a number of factors. Students who attend the tutoring program may care more about their grades or may be struggling with their work. This confounding is depicted in the Figures 1-3 on the right through the bidirected arc between Tutoring Program and GPA. If students are assigned to dormitories at random, the proximity of the student's dorm to the tutoring program is a natural candidate for being an instrumental variable. However, what if the tutoring program is located in the college library? In that case, Proximity may also cause students to spend more time at the library, which in turn improves their GPA (see Figure 1). Using the causal graph depicted in the Figure 2, we see that Proximity does not qualify as an instrumental variable because it is connected to GPA through the path Proximity \\\\rightarrow Library Hours \\\\rightarrow GPA in G_{\\\\overline{X}}. However, if we control for Library Hours by adding it as a covariate then Proximity becomes an instrumental variable, since Proximity is separated from GPA given Library Hours in G_{\\\\overline{X}}. Now, suppose that we notice that a student's \\"natural ability\\" affects his or her number of hours in the library as well as his or her GPA, as in Figure 3. Using the causal graph, we see that Library Hours is a collider and conditioning on it opens the path Proximity \\\\rightarrow Library Hours \\\\leftrightarrow GPA. As a result, Proximity cannot be used as an instrumental variable. Finally, suppose that Library Hours does not actually affect GPA because students who do not study in the library simply study elsewhere, as in Figure 4. In this case, controlling for Library Hours still opens a spurious path from Proximity to GPA. However, if we do not control for Library Hours and remove it as a covariate then Proximity can again be used an instrumental variable. Estimation We now revisit and expand upon the mechanics of IV in greater detail. Suppose the data are generated by a process of the form : y_i = X_i \\\\beta + e_i, where * i indexes observations, * y_i is the i-th value of the dependent variable, * X_i is a vector of the i-th values of the independent variable(s) and a constant, * e_i is the i-th value of an unobserved error term representing all causes of y_i other than X_i, and * \\\\beta is an unobserved parameter vector. The parameter vector \\\\beta is the causal effect on y_i of a one unit change in each element of X_i, holding all other causes of y_i constant. The econometric goal is to estimate \\\\beta. For simplicity's sake assume the draws of e are uncorrelated and that they are drawn from distributions with the same variance (that is, that the errors are serially uncorrelated and homoskedastic). Suppose also that a regression model of nominally the same form is proposed. Given a random sample of T observations from this process, the ordinary least squares estimator is : \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{OLS} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y = (X'X)^{-1} X'(X \\\\beta + e) = \\\\beta + (X'X)^{-1} X'e where X, y and e denote column vectors of length T. This equation is similar to the equation involving \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,y) in the introduction (this is the matrix version of that equation). When X and e are uncorrelated, under certain regularity conditions the second term has an expected value conditional on X of zero and converges to zero in the limit, so the estimator is unbiased and consistent. When X and the other unmeasured, causal variables collapsed into the e term are correlated, however, the OLS estimator is generally biased and inconsistent for Œ≤. In this case, it is valid to use the estimates to predict values of y given values of X, but the estimate does not recover the causal effect of X on y. To recover the underlying parameter \\\\beta , we introduce a set of variables Z that is highly correlated with each endogenous component of X but (in our underlying model) is not correlated with e. For simplicity, one might consider X to be a T √ó 2 matrix composed of a column of constants and one endogenous variable, and Z to be a T √ó 2 consisting of a column of constants and one instrumental variable. However, this technique generalizes to X being a matrix of a constant and, say, 5 endogenous variables, with Z being a matrix composed of a constant and 5 instruments. In the discussion that follows, we will assume that X is a T √ó K matrix and leave this value K unspecified. An estimator in which X and Z are both T √ó K matrices is referred to as just-identified . Suppose that the relationship between each endogenous component xi and the instruments is given by : x_i = Z_i \\\\gamma + v_i, The most common IV specification uses the following estimator: : \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{IV} = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'y This specification approaches the true parameter as the sample gets large, so long as Z'e = 0 in the true model: : \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{IV} = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'y = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'X \\\\beta + (Z'X)^{-1} Z'e \\\\rightarrow \\\\beta As long as Z'e = 0 in the underlying process which generates the data, the appropriate use of the IV estimator will identify this parameter. This works because IV solves for the unique parameter that satisfies Z'e = 0 , and therefore hones in on the true underlying parameter as the sample size grows. Now an extension: suppose that there are more instruments than there are covariates in the equation of interest, so that Z is a T √ó M matrix with M > K. This is often called the over-identified case. In this case, the generalized method of moments (GMM) can be used. The GMM IV estimator is : \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{GMM} = (X' P_Z X)^{-1}X' P_Z y, where P_Z refers to the projection matrix P_Z=Z(Z' Z)^{-1}Z'. This expression collapses to the first when the number of instruments is equal to the number of covariates in the equation of interest. The over-identified IV is therefore a generalization of the just-identified IV. Developing the \\\\beta_{GMM} expression: : \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{GMM} = (X^\\\\mathrm{T} Z(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T} X)^{-1}X^\\\\mathrm{T} Z(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T} y In the just-identified case, we have as many instruments as covariates, so that the dimension of X is the same as that of Z. Hence, X^\\\\mathrm{T} Z, Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z and Z^\\\\mathrm{T}X are all squared matrices of the same dimension. We can expand the inverse, using the fact that, for any invertible n-by-n matrices A and B, (AB)‚àí1 = B‚àí1A‚àí1 (see Invertible matrix#Properties): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{GMM} &= (Z^\\\\mathrm{T} X)^{-1}(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)(X^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}X^\\\\mathrm{T} Z(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T} y\\\\ &= (Z^\\\\mathrm{T} X)^{-1}(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T} y\\\\ &=(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} X)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T}y \\\\ &=\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{IV} \\\\end{align} Reference: see Davidson and Mackinnnon (1993) There is an equivalent under-identified estimator for the case where m < k. Since the parameters are the solutions to a set of linear equations, an under-identified model using the set of equations Z'v = 0 does not have a unique solution. Interpretation as two-stage least squares One computational method which can be used to calculate IV estimates is two-stage least squares (2SLS or TSLS). In the first stage, each explanatory variable that is an endogenous covariate in the equation of interest is regressed on all of the exogenous variables in the model, including both exogenous covariates in the equation of interest and the excluded instruments. The predicted values from these regressions are obtained: Stage 1: Regress each column of X on Z, ( X = Z \\\\delta + \\\\text{errors} ): : \\\\widehat{\\\\delta}=(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T}X, \\\\, and save the predicted values: : \\\\widehat{X}= Z\\\\widehat{\\\\delta} = {\\\\color{ProcessBlue}Z(Z^\\\\mathrm{T} Z)^{-1}Z^\\\\mathrm{T}}X = {\\\\color{ProcessBlue}P_Z} X.\\\\, In the second stage, the regression of interest is estimated as usual, except that in this stage each endogenous covariate is replaced with the predicted values from the first stage: Stage 2: Regress Y on the predicted values from the first stage: : Y = \\\\widehat X \\\\beta + \\\\mathrm{noise},\\\\, which gives : \\\\beta_{2SLS} = \\\\left(X^\\\\mathrm{T}{\\\\color{ProcessBlue}P_Z} X\\\\right)^{-1} X^\\\\mathrm{T}{\\\\color{ProcessBlue}P_Z}Y. The usual OLS estimator is: (\\\\widehat X^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\widehat X)^{-1}\\\\widehat X^\\\\mathrm{T}Y. Replacing \\\\widehat X = P_Z X and noting that P_Z is a symmetric and idempotent matrix, so that P_Z^\\\\mathrm{T}P_Z=P_Z P_Z = P_Z : \\\\beta_{2SLS} = (\\\\widehat X^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\widehat X)^{-1}\\\\widehat X^\\\\mathrm{T} Y = \\\\left(X^\\\\mathrm{T}P_Z^\\\\mathrm{T}P_Z X\\\\right)^{-1} X^\\\\mathrm{T}P_Z^\\\\mathrm{T}Y=\\\\left(X^\\\\mathrm{T}P_Z X\\\\right)^{-1} X^\\\\mathrm{T}P_ZY. The resulting estimator of \\\\beta is numerically identical to the expression displayed above. A small correction must be made to the sum-of- squared residuals in the second-stage fitted model in order that the covariance matrix of \\\\beta is calculated correctly. Non-parametric analysis When the form of the structural equations is unknown, an instrumental variable Z can still be defined through the equations: :x = g(z,u) \\\\, :y = f(x,u) \\\\, where f and g are two arbitrary functions and Z is independent of U. Unlike linear models, however, measurements of Z, X and Y do not allow for the identification of the average causal effect of X on Y, denoted ACE :\\\\text{ACE} = \\\\Pr(y\\\\mid \\\\text{do}(x)) = \\\\operatorname{E}_u[f(x,u)]. Balke and Pearl [1997] derived tight bounds on ACE and showed that these can provide valuable information on the sign and size of ACE. In linear analysis, there is no test to falsify the assumption the Z is instrumental relative to the pair (X,Y). This is not the case when X is discrete. Pearl (2000) has shown that, for all f and g, the following constraint, called \\"Instrumental Inequality\\" must hold whenever Z satisfies the two equations above: :\\\\max_x \\\\sum_y [\\\\max_z \\\\Pr(y,x\\\\mid z)]\\\\leq 1. Interpretation under treatment effect heterogeneity The exposition above assumes that the causal effect of interest does not vary across observations, that is, that \\\\beta is a constant. Generally, different subjects will respond in different ways to changes in the \\"treatment\\" x. When this possibility is recognized, the average effect in the population of a change in x on y may differ from the effect in a given subpopulation. For example, the average effect of a job training program may substantially differ across the group of people who actually receive the training and the group which chooses not to receive training. For these reasons, IV methods invoke implicit assumptions on behavioral response, or more generally assumptions over the correlation between the response to treatment and propensity to receive treatment. The standard IV estimator can recover local average treatment effects (LATE) rather than average treatment effects (ATE). Imbens and Angrist (1994) demonstrate that the linear IV estimate can be interpreted under weak conditions as a weighted average of local average treatment effects, where the weights depend on the elasticity of the endogenous regressor to changes in the instrumental variables. Roughly, that means that the effect of a variable is only revealed for the subpopulations affected by the observed changes in the instruments, and that subpopulations which respond most to changes in the instruments will have the largest effects on the magnitude of the IV estimate. For example, if a researcher uses presence of a land-grant college as an instrument for college education in an earnings regression, she identifies the effect of college on earnings in the subpopulation which would obtain a college degree if a college is present but which would not obtain a degree if a college is not present. This empirical approach does not, without further assumptions, tell the researcher anything about the effect of college among people who would either always or never get a college degree regardless of whether a local college exists. Weak instruments problem As Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) note, a problem is caused by the selection of \\"weak\\" instruments, instruments that are poor predictors of the endogenous question predictor in the first-stage equation. In this case, the prediction of the question predictor by the instrument will be poor and the predicted values will have very little variation. Consequently, they are unlikely to have much success in predicting the ultimate outcome when they are used to replace the question predictor in the second-stage equation. In the context of the smoking and health example discussed above, tobacco taxes are weak instruments for smoking if smoking status is largely unresponsive to changes in taxes. If higher taxes do not induce people to quit smoking (or not start smoking), then variation in tax rates tells us nothing about the effect of smoking on health. If taxes affect health through channels other than through their effect on smoking, then the instruments are invalid and the instrumental variables approach may yield misleading results. For example, places and times with relatively health-conscious populations may both implement high tobacco taxes and exhibit better health even holding smoking rates constant, so we would observe a correlation between health and tobacco taxes even if it were the case that smoking has no effect on health. In this case, we would be mistaken to infer a causal effect of smoking on health from the observed correlation between tobacco taxes and health. Testing for weak instruments The strength of the instruments can be directly assessed because both the endogenous covariates and the instruments are observable. A common rule of thumb for models with one endogenous regressor is: the F-statistic against the null that the excluded instruments are irrelevant in the first-stage regression should be larger than 10. Statistical inference and hypothesis testing When the covariates are exogenous, the small-sample properties of the OLS estimator can be derived in a straightforward manner by calculating moments of the estimator conditional on X. When some of the covariates are endogenous so that instrumental variables estimation is implemented, simple expressions for the moments of the estimator cannot be so obtained. Generally, instrumental variables estimators only have desirable asymptotic, not finite sample, properties, and inference is based on asymptotic approximations to the sampling distribution of the estimator. Even when the instruments are uncorrelated with the error in the equation of interest and when the instruments are not weak, the finite sample properties of the instrumental variables estimator may be poor. For example, exactly identified models produce finite sample estimators with no moments, so the estimator can be said to be neither biased nor unbiased, the nominal size of test statistics may be substantially distorted, and the estimates may commonly be far away from the true value of the parameter. Testing the exclusion restriction The assumption that the instruments are not correlated with the error term in the equation of interest is not testable in exactly identified models. If the model is overidentified, there is information available which may be used to test this assumption. The most common test of these overidentifying restrictions, called the Sargan‚ÄìHansen test, is based on the observation that the residuals should be uncorrelated with the set of exogenous variables if the instruments are truly exogenous. The Sargan‚ÄìHansen test statistic can be calculated as TR^2 (the number of observations multiplied by the coefficient of determination) from the OLS regression of the residuals onto the set of exogenous variables. This statistic will be asymptotically chi-squared with m ‚àí k degrees of freedom under the null that the error term is uncorrelated with the instruments.  Application to random and fixed effects models In the standard random effects (RE) and fixed effects (FE) models for panel data, independent variables are assumed to be uncorrelated with error terms. Provided the availability of valid instruments, RE and FE methods extend to the case where some of the explanatory variables are allowed to be endogenous. As in the exogenous setting, RE model with Instrumental Variables (REIV) requires more stringent assumptions than FE model with Instrumental Variables (FEIV) but it tends to be more efficient under appropriate conditions.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. To fix ideas, consider the following model: : y_{it}=x_{it}\\\\beta+c_i+u_{it} where c_i is unobserved unit-specific time- invariant effect (call it unobserved effect) and x_{it} can be correlated with u_{is} for s possibly different from t. Suppose there exists a set of valid instruments z_{i}=(z_{i1},\\\\ldots,z_{it}). In REIV setting, key assumptions include that z_{i} is uncorrelated with c_{i} as well as u_{it} for t=1,\\\\ldots,T. In fact, for REIV estimator to be efficient, conditions stronger than uncorrelatedness between instruments and unobserved effect are necessary. On the other hand, FEIV estimator only requires that instruments be exogenous with error terms after conditioning on unobserved effect i.e. E[u_{it} \\\\mid z_i,c_i]=0[1]. The FEIV condition allows for arbitrary correlation between instruments and unobserved effect. However, this generality does not come for free: time-invariant explanatory and instrumental variables are not allowed. As in the usual FE method, the estimator uses time-demeaned variables to remove unobserved effect. Therefore, FEIV estimator would be of limited use if variables of interest include time-invariant ones. The above discussion has parallel to the exogenous case of RE and FE models. In the exogenous case, RE assumes uncorrelatedness between explanatory variables and unobserved effect, and FE allows for arbitrary correlation between the two. Similar to the standard case, REIV tends to be more efficient than FEIV provided that appropriate assumptions hold. Methods for generalized linear models Methods have been developed to extend instrumental variables estimation to generalized linear models. Poisson regression Wooldridge and Terza provide a methodology to both deal with and test for endogeneity within the exponential regression framework, which the following discussion follows closely.Wooldridge 1997, pp. 382‚Äì383; Terza 1998 While the example focuses on a Poisson regression model, it is possible to generalize to other exponential regression models, although this may come at the cost of additional assumptions (e.g. for binary response or censored data models). Assume the following exponential regression model, where a_i is an unobserved term in the latent variable. We allow for correlation between a_i and x_i (implying x_i is possibly endogenous), but allow for no such correlation between a_i and z_i. : \\\\operatorname E[y_i \\\\mid x_i, z_i, a_i] = \\\\exp(x_i b_0 + z_i c_0+a_i) The variables z_i serve as instrumental variables for the potentially endogenous x_i. One can assume a linear relationship between these two variables or alternatively project the endogenous variable x_i onto the instruments to get the following reduced form equation: The usual rank condition is needed to ensure identification. The endogeneity is then modeled in the following way, where \\\\rho determines the severity of endogeneity and v_i is assumed to be independent of e_i. : a_i=v_i \\\\rho+e_i Imposing these assumptions, assuming the models are correctly specified, and normalizing \\\\operatorname E[\\\\exp(e_i)]=1, we can rewrite the conditional mean as follows: If v_i were known at this point, it would be possible to estimate the relevant parameters by quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE). Following the two step procedure strategies, Wooldridge and Terza propose estimating equation () by ordinary least squares. The fitted residuals from this regression can then be plugged into the estimating equation () and QMLE methods will lead to consistent estimators of the parameters of interest. Significance tests on \\\\hat\\\\rho can then be used to test for endogeneity within the model.

The Erlenmeyer receptacles are on the floor. Column chromatography in chemistry is a chromatography method used to isolate a single chemical compound from a mixture. Chromatography is able to separate substances based on differential adsorption of compounds to the adsorbent; compounds move through the column at different rates, allowing them to be separated into fractions. The technique is widely applicable, as many different adsorbents (normal phase, reversed phase, or otherwise) can be used with a wide range of solvents. The technique can be used on scales from micrograms up to kilograms. The main advantage of column chromatography is the relatively low cost and disposability of the stationary phase used in the process. The latter prevents cross-contamination and stationary phase degradation due to recycling. Column chromatography can be done using gravity to move the solvent, or using compressed gas to push the solvent through the column. A thin-layer chromatograph can show how a mixture of compounds will behave when purified by column chromatography. The separation is first optimised using thin-layer chromatography before performing column chromatography.  Column preparation  A column is prepared by packing a solid absorbent into a cylindrical glass or plastic tube. The size will depend on the amount of compound being isolated. The base of the tube contains a filter, either a cotton or glass wool plug, or glass frit to hold the solid phase in place. A solvent reservoir may be attached at the top of the column. Two methods are generally used to prepare a column: the dry method and the wet method. For the dry method, the column is first filled with dry stationary phase powder, followed by the addition of mobile phase, which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet, and from this point is never allowed to run dry. For the wet method, a slurry is prepared of the eluent with the stationary phase powder and then carefully poured into the column. The top of the silica should be flat, and the top of the silica can be protected by a layer of sand. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. The individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are running at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute one at a time. During the entire chromatography process the eluent is collected in a series of fractions. Fractions can be collected automatically by means of fraction collectors. The productivity of chromatography can be increased by running several columns at a time. In this case multi stream collectors are used. The composition of the eluent flow can be monitored and each fraction is analyzed for dissolved compounds, e.g. by analytical chromatography, UV absorption spectra, or fluorescence. Colored compounds (or fluorescent compounds with the aid of a UV lamp) can be seen through the glass wall as moving bands.  Stationary phase  Automated fraction collector and sampler for chromatography techniques The stationary phase or adsorbent in column chromatography is a solid. The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is silica gel, the next most common being alumina. Cellulose powder has often been used in the past. A wide range of stationary phases are available in order to perform ion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography (RP), affinity chromatography or expanded bed adsorption (EBA). The stationary phases are usually finely ground powders or gels and/or are microporous for an increased surface, though in EBA a fluidized bed is used. There is an important ratio between the stationary phase weight and the dry weight of the analyte mixture that can be applied onto the column. For silica column chromatography, this ratio lies within 20:1 to 100:1, depending on how close to each other the analyte components are being eluted.  Mobile phase (eluent)  Column chromatography proceeds by a series of steps. The mobile phase or eluent is a solvent or a mixture of solvents used to move the compounds through the column. It is chosen so that the retention factor value of the compound of interest is roughly around 0.2 - 0.3 in order to minimize the time and the amount of eluent to run the chromatography. The eluent has also been chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The eluent is optimized in small scale pretests, often using thin layer chromatography (TLC) with the same stationary phase. There is an optimum flow rate for each particular separation. A faster flow rate of the eluent minimizes the time required to run a column and thereby minimizes diffusion, resulting in a better separation. However, the maximum flow rate is limited because a finite time is required for the analyte to equilibrate between the stationary phase and mobile phase, see Van Deemter's equation. A simple laboratory column runs by gravity flow. The flow rate of such a column can be increased by extending the fresh eluent filled column above the top of the stationary phase or decreased by the tap controls. Faster flow rates can be achieved by using a pump or by using compressed gas (e.g. air, nitrogen, or argon) to push the solvent through the column (flash column chromatography). Photographic sequence of a column chromatography The particle size of the stationary phase is generally finer in flash column chromatography than in gravity column chromatography. For example, one of the most widely used silica gel grades in the former technique is mesh 230 ‚Äì 400 (40 ‚Äì 63 ¬µm), while the latter technique typically requires mesh 70 ‚Äì 230 (63 ‚Äì 200 ¬µm) silica gel. A spreadsheet that assists in the successful development of flash columns has been developed. The spreadsheet estimates the retention volume and band volume of analytes, the fraction numbers expected to contain each analyte, and the resolution between adjacent peaks. This information allows users to select optimal parameters for preparative-scale separations before the flash column itself is attempted.  Automated systems  An automated ion chromatography system. Column chromatography is an extremely time-consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab. Many manufacturers like Biotage, Buchi, Interchim and Teledyne Isco have developed automated flash chromatography systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around ) that minimize human involvement in the purification process. Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems such as a gradient pump, sample injection ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent. Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial many kilogram scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems. The resolution (or the ability to separate a mixture) on an LPLC system will always be lower compared to HPLC, as the packing material in an HPLC column can be much smaller, typically only 5 micrometre thus increasing stationary phase surface area, increasing surface interactions and giving better separation. However, the use of this small packing media causes the high back pressure and is why it is termed high pressure liquid chromatography. The LPLC columns are typically packed with silica of around 50 micrometres, thus reducing back pressure and resolution, but it also removes the need for expensive high pressure pumps. Manufacturers are now starting to move into higher pressure flash chromatography systems and have termed these as medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) systems which operate above .  Column chromatogram resolution calculation  Powdery silica gel for column chromatography Typically, column chromatography is set up with peristaltic pumps, flowing buffers and the solution sample through the top of the column. The solutions and buffers pass through the column where a fraction collector at the end of the column setup collects the eluted samples. Prior to the fraction collection, the samples that are eluted from the column pass through a detector such as a spectrophotometer or mass spectrometer so that the concentration of the separated samples in the sample solution mixture can be determined. For example, if you were to separate two different proteins with different binding capacities to the column from a solution sample, a good type of detector would be a spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 280 nm. The higher the concentration of protein that passes through the eluted solution through the column, the higher the absorbance of that wavelength. Because the column chromatography has a constant flow of eluted solution passing through the detector at varying concentrations, the detector must plot the concentration of the eluted sample over a course of time. This plot of sample concentration versus time is called a chromatogram. The ultimate goal of chromatography is to separate different components from a solution mixture. The resolution expresses the extent of separation between the components from the mixture. The higher the resolution of the chromatogram, the better the extent of separation of the samples the column gives. This data is a good way of determining the column's separation properties of that particular sample. The resolution can be calculated from the chromatogram. The separate curves in the diagram represent different sample elution concentration profiles over time based on their affinity to the column resin. To calculate resolution, the retention time and curve width are required. Retention time is the time from the start of signal detection by the detector to the peak height of the elution concentration profile of each different sample. Curve width is the width of the concentration profile curve of the different samples in the chromatogram in units of time. A simplified method of calculating chromatogram resolution is to use the plate model. The plate model assumes that the column can be divided into a certain number of sections, or plates and the mass balance can be calculated for each individual plate. This approach approximates a typical chromatogram curve as a Gaussian distribution curve. By doing this, the curve width is estimated as 4 times the standard deviation of the curve, 4œÉ. The retention time is the time from the start of signal detection to the time of the peak height of the Gaussian curve. From the variables in the figure above, the resolution, plate number, and plate height of the column plate model can be calculated using the equations: Resolution (Rs) Rs = 2(tRB ‚Äì tRA)/(wB \\\\+ wA) Where: tRB = retention time of solute B tRA = retention time of solute A wB = Gaussian curve width of solute B wA = Gaussian curve width of solute A Plate Number (N): N = (tR)2/(w/4)2 Plate Height (H): H = L/N Where L is the length of the column.  Column adsorption equilibrium  For an adsorption column, the column resin (the stationary phase) is composed of microbeads. Even smaller particles such as proteins, carbohydrates, metal ions, or other chemical compounds are conjugated onto the microbeads. Each binding particle that is attached to the microbead can be assumed to bind in a 1:1 ratio with the solute sample sent through the column that needs to be purified or separated. Binding between the target molecule to be separated and the binding molecule on the column beads can be modeled using a simple equilibrium reaction Keq = [CS]/([C][S]) where Keq is the equilibrium constant, [C] and [S] are the concentrations of the target molecule and the binding molecule on the column resin, respectively. [CS] is the concentration of the complex of the target molecule bound to the column resin. Using this as a basis, three different isotherms can be used to describe the binding dynamics of a column chromatography: linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich. The linear isotherm occurs when the solute concentration needed to be purified is very small relative to the binding molecule. Thus, the equilibrium can be defined as: [CS] = Keq[C]. For industrial scale uses, the total binding molecules on the column resin beads must be factored in because unoccupied sites must be taken into account. The Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm are useful in describing this equilibrium. Langmuir Isotherm: [CS] = (KeqStot[C])/(1 + Keq[C]), where Stot is the total binding molecules on the beads. Freundlich isotherm: [CS] = Keq[C]1/n The Freundlich isotherm is used when the column can bind to many different samples in the solution that needs to be purified. Because the many different samples have different binding constants to the beads, there are many different Keq's. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm is not a good model for binding in this case.

In 1971, he became the first music critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. In addition, Schonberg reviewed mysteries and thrillers for The New York Times under the name Newgate Callender for nearly a quarter of a century. He also wrote a number of books on music, and one on chess. Life and career as music critic Schonberg was born in New York City to David and Minnie (Kirsch) Schonberg on November 29, 1915. He had a brother (Stanley) and a sister (Edith). His aunt, Alice Frisca, was a former concert pianist, and would become his first music teacher.Allan Kozinn, \\"Harold C. Schonberg, 87, Dies; Won Pulitzer Prize as Music Critic for The Times\\" New York Times (July 27, 2003). Schonberg graduated from Brooklyn College in 1937, and undertook graduate studies at New York University. In 1939, he became a record critic for American Music Lover Magazine (later renamed the American Record Guide). During World War II, Schonberg was a first lieutenant in the United States Army Airborne Signal Corps. He had hoped to enlist as a pilot, but was declared pastel-blind (he could distinguish colors but not shadings and subtleties) and was sent to London, where he was a code breaker and later a parachutist. He broke his leg on a training jump before D-Day and could not participate in the Normandy invasion; every member of his platoon who jumped into France was ultimately killed. He remained in the Army until 1946. Schonberg joined The New York Times in 1950. He rose to the post of senior music critic for the Times a decade later. In this capacity he published daily reviews and longer features on operas and classical music on Sundays. He also worked effectively behind the scenes to increase music coverage in the Times and develop its first-rate music staff. Upon his retirement as senior music critic in 1980 he became cultural correspondent for the Times. Schonberg also wrote articles for Harper's and High Fidelity magazine, among others. Schonberg was an extremely influential music writer. Aside from his contributions to music journalism, he published 13 books, most of them on music, including The Great Pianists: From Mozart to the Present (1963, revised 1987)‚Äîpianists were a specialty of Schonberg‚Äîand The Lives of the Great Composers (1970; revised 1981, 1997) which traced the lives of major composers from Monteverdi through to modern times. Criticisms of Bernstein Schonberg was highly critical of Leonard Bernstein during the composer- conductor's eleven-year tenure (1958‚Äì69) as principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic. He accused Bernstein of showing off by using exaggerated gestures on the podium and of conducting a piece in a way that made its structure overly obvious to audiences (e.g., slowing down during the transition from one main theme to another). One of Schonberg's most famous criticisms of Bernstein was written after the famous April 6, 1962, performance before which Bernstein announced that he disagreed with pianist Glenn Gould's interpretation of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 but was going to conduct it anyway because he found it fascinating. Schonberg chided Bernstein in print, suggesting that he should have either refrained from publicizing his disagreement, backed out of the concert, or imposed his own will on Gould; Schonberg called Bernstein \\"the Peter Pan of music\\". In the chapter on Bernstein in his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Schonberg quotes the remark but neglects to mention that he was the critic who had made it. After Bernstein's regular tenure at the New York Philharmonic ended, however, Schonberg seemed to mellow in his attitude toward him and actually began to praise his conducting, stating in his book The Glorious Ones that \\"with age, came less of a need to prove something\\", and that \\"there were moments of glory in his conceptions.\\" Other interests A devoted and skilled chess player, Schonberg covered the 1972 championship match between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer held in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. One of Schonberg's books not on music was Grandmasters of Chess. He also reviewed mysteries and thrillers for The New York Times under the pseudonym Newgate Callender from 1972-1995. Schonberg was also an avid golfer, though a poor one by his own estimation. He co-authored the book How To Play Double Bogey Golf (1975) along with Hollis Alpert, founder of the National Society of Film Critics, and fellow author Ira Mothner. Schonberg, Mothner and Alpert frequently played golf together, according to the book. Later life and death In 1984, Schonberg taught music criticism at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. In 1987, it was announced that Schonberg was assisting Vladimir Horowitz in the preparation of the pianist's memoirs. Although the project was never completed, Schonberg's biography of Horowitz was published in 1992. Schonberg died in New York City on July 26, 2003, at the age of 87. In his obituary notice in The New York Times the next day, Allan Kozinn wrote that \\"as a music critic Harold Schonberg set the standard for critical evaluation and journalistic thoroughness.\\" Books  *  * (a biography of Vladimir Horowitz) References *Sony Classical.

Loch Shiel () is a freshwater loch situated west of Fort William in the Highland council area of Scotland. At long it is the 4th longest loch in Scotland, and is the longest to have retained a natural outflow without any regulation of its water level, being 120 m (393 ft) deep. Its nature changes considerably along its length, being deep and enclosed by mountains in the north east and shallow surrounded by bog and rough pasture in the south west, from which end the 4 km River Shiel drains to the sea in Loch Moidart near Castle Tioram. The surrounding highlands are picturesque but relatively rarely climbed as none quite reaches the required for Munro status. A number of the hills are classified as Corbetts, including Beinn Resipol, Sg√πrr Ghiubhsachain and Sgorr Craobh a' Chaorainn on the southern side of the loch; and Beinn Odhar Bheag on the northern side.R. Milne & H. Brown. The Corbetts and Other Scottish Hills. 2002. Published by the Scottish Mountaineering Trust. . The area is well wooded compared to the many Highland areas that have suffered from overgrazing. The view of the loch looking south from the Glenfinnan monument, showing wooded hillsides with bare summits rising steeply from a fjord-like loch, has become one of the most famous images of the Scottish Highlands. Several major films have used the loch for location shooting. Loch Shiel is less than 10 metres above sea level,Ordnance Survey. Landranger 1:50000. Sheet 40, Mallaig & Glenfinnan. and was formed at the end of the last ice age when glacial deposits blocked what was formerly a sea loch.Tom Weir. The Scottish Lochs. pp. 99-101. Published by Constable and Company, 1980. Nature and conservation Loch Shiel is a Special Protection Area (SPA) due to its importance for breeding black-throated divers, and the area surrounding the loch is also designated as an SPA due to the presence of breeding golden eagles. Other bird species living around the loch include white-tailed sea eagles, red-throated divers, peregrine falcons, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common kestrels, ospreys and hen harrier. Several species of duck are also present, including little grebes, goosanders, red-breasted mergansers, mallards, goldeneyes and tufted ducks. Fish in the loch include salmon, sea trout and brown trout. Fishing rights are controlled by the Lochaber Fisheries Trust, who issue permits for fishing from Acharacle at the south west end of the loch. There are areas of remnant Caledonian Forest on the islands of the loch such as Eilean Camas and Eilean Ghleann Fhoinainn, as well as at Meall na h-Airigh at the northern end of the loch. There are also areas of oak and alder woodlands (see Celtic rain forest) on the shoreline of the loch which are designated as a Special Area of Conservation by NatureScot, who noted that overgrazing and invasive species were threats to the area. The shoreline of the loch is also home to a population of otters. Claish Moss, to the south of the loch, is one of the best examples of a raised bog in Britain. The bog has developed over the past 8,000 years, with pollen grains preserved by the peat forming a record of the bog‚Äôs plant life since the bog first began to form. The bog is designated as an SAC, and was also formerly a national nature reserve, but was de-designated in 2011 due to poor access for visitors. The loch gives its name to Loch Shiel National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection via the planning system by the restriction of certain forms of development. The Loch Shiel NSA covers 13,045 ha, and extends to the summits of the hills on either side of the loch, as well as the hills surrounding Glen Hurich and the monument at Glenfinnan. History A ruined medieval chapel found on the largest island, Eilean Fhianain, is dedicated to St. Finan, and may stand on the site of a cell thought to have been built on the island by the saint in the seventh century. The chapel is thought to have been built by Alan MacRuaridh, a chief of Clan Ranald; the clan used the island as a burial place until the end of the sixteenth century. The island continues to be used for burials, and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Acharacle, at the south of the Loch, is the site of the 1140 battle in which Somerled defeated the Norse to found the ruling dynasty of Lord of the Isles.. During these times, the loch had strategic importance as a communications route through the mountains, as the short River Shiel was easily navigable in ancient times, however is no longer navigable as the depth drops to less than a foot. In the medieval period the loch formed the boundary between the provinces or lordships of Moidart to the west, Ardgour to the east, and Sunart in the south. Castle Tioram on the tidal island Eilean Tioram in Loch Moidart, is located so as to control access to Loch Shiel, and thus to Lochaber and the Great Glen, from the sea. The castle appears to have originally been a principal stronghold of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Tabraham, C (2005) [1997]. Scotland's Castles. London: BT Batsford. . pp. 29, 111. According to early modern tradition, preserved by the seventeenth-century Sleat History, the castle was erected by √Åine Nic Ruaidhr√≠ (fl. 1318-50), and certainly served as the seat of the latter's Clann Raghnaill descendants for centuries.Stell, G (2014). \\"Castle Tioram and the MacDonalds of Clanranald: A Western Seaboard Castle in Context\\". In Oram, RD. The Lordship of the Isles. The Northern World: North Europe and the Baltic c. 400‚Äì1700 AD. Peoples, Economics and Cultures (series vol. 68). pp 273-278 Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, the poet and Scottish Gaelic tutor of Bonnie Prince Charlie, was born and raised in the area. At the start of the Jacobite rising of 1745, the prince disembarked at Loch nan Uamh and was rowed the length of Loch Shiel in order to raise his standard at Glenfinnan. After the defeat of the rising at Culloden a number of prominent Jacobites, including Cameron of Lochiel, hid on the small island of Eilean Mhic Dhomnuill Dhuibh in Loch Shiel. In 1842, during the Highland Clearances when tenants were cleared off the land to make way for sheep farming, the women of Loch Shiel apparently drove off the eviction party. The women were apparently armed with shearing hooks and aprons filled with stones. Transport Prior to the construction of the A861 road the loch served as a main transport route in the area, linking the communities at the south end of the loch to the West Highland railway line at Glenfinnan. The regular service carrying mail and passengers was operated by David MacBrayne's between 1953 and 1967, ceasing with the construction of the new road between Lochailort and Kinlochmoidart. The West Highland railway line and the A830 road both pass the northern end of the Loch Shiel at Glenfinnan, whilst the A861 road also runs close to the lochside for about 4 km at the southern end. There are no public roads that run the full length of the loch: a forestry track runs along the southern side between Polloch and Glenfinnan, whilst no tracks or paths exist on the northern side. Cruises on the loch are available from Glenfinnan, Acharacle and Polloch. In popular culture Loch Shiel was the purported secret location of the Black Lake near Hogwarts school in the Harry Potter films. The area was the fictional birthplace of Connor and Duncan MacLeod from the Highlander franchise, and served as the actual location of the boat scene with Ramirez in Highlander (1986). Loch Shiel was also used in the filming of the movie The Master of Ballantrae starring Errol Flynn.

He served three stints as the head football coach at the University of Tennessee (UT) from 1926 to 1934, 1936 to 1940, and 1946 to 1952. He is one of two college football coaches to have won national titles in two non-consecutive tenures at the same school, along with Frank Leahy of the University of Notre Dame. Neyland holds the record for most wins in Tennessee Volunteers history with 173 wins in 216 games, six undefeated seasons, nine undefeated regular seasons, seven conference championships, and four national championships. At UT, he reeled off undefeated streaks of 33, 28, 23, 19, and 14 games. Neyland is often referred to as one of the best, if not the best, defensive football coaches ever. Sports Illustrated named Neyland as the defensive coordinator of its all- century college football team in its \\"Best of the 20th Century\\" edition. 112 of his victories came via shutout. In 1938 and 1939, Neyland's Vols set NCAA records when they shut out 17 straight opponents for 71 consecutive shutout quarters. His 1939 squad is the last NCAA team in history to hold every regular season opponent scoreless. Neyland was also an innovator. He is credited with being the first coach to utilize sideline telephones and game film to study opponents. His teams also were some of the first to wear lightweight pads and tearaway jerseys. Such measures increased his players' elusiveness and exemplify Neyland's \\"speed over strength\\" philosophy. Neyland is also famous for creating the seven \\"Game Maxims\\" of football that many coaches, on all levels, still use. Tennessee players recite the maxims before every game in the locker room as a team. Neyland Stadium at UT is not only named for The General, but was designed by him. His plans formed the basis for all expansions that brought the stadium to its modern size with an over 100,000 seat capacity. Neyland was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1956. On November 12, 2010, a , nearly bronze statue of General Neyland was unveiled between gates 15A and 17 at Neyland Stadium. The statue, which was commissioned by artist Blair Buswell, is twice life-size. Since Neyland is portrayed in the kneeling position rather than standing, the statue is tall (a standing statue would have stood tall). The base is and features Neyland's well-known seven Game Maxims engraved into the precast. Early life Born in Greenville, Texas, Neyland was appointed to West Point by Congressman Sam Rayburn, graduating in 1916. One of the greatest athletes of his day, he was a star football lineman, baseball pitcher, and national collegiate boxing champion. He was commissioned as an officer in the Corps of Engineers and served in France during World War I. After the war he served as an aide to Douglas MacArthur, who was then superintendent at West Point, and became an assistant football coach for the Black Knights of the Hudson. Coaching career Statue of Robert Neyland on display at Neyland Stadium Wanting to continue coaching, Captain Neyland was appointed Professor of Military Science at the University of Tennessee (UT) in 1925. After one season as an assistant to head coach M. B. Banks, Neyland was named head coach and athletic director by school president Nathan W. Dougherty in 1926. He coached the team for nine years before the Army called him to active duty for one year in Panama. During that first nine-year stint with the Vols, Neyland had five undefeated seasons, all within a six-year period (1927, 1928, 1929, 1931, and 1932). The Vols reeled off undefeated streaks of 33 and 28 straight games. Upon returning stateside from the Panama Canal Zone, he returned to UT as head coach. Neyland's 1938 team went undefeated and was proclaimed national champion by several minor outlets. His 1939 squad is notable for being the last college football team to go an entire regular season unscored upon, shutting out every opponent; his team was then shut out by USC in the Rose Bowl. From November 5, 1938 to December 9, 1939, the Vols ran off 17 straight shutouts and 71 consecutive shutout quarters‚Äîrecords that have never been seriously threatened. Neyland completed another undefeated regular season in 1940. He was recalled to military service again in 1941. In fall 1942, Neyland was appointed as head coach of an Eastern All-Army team that took on National Football League clubs to raise money for the Army Emergency Relief fund. The Eastern All-Army played three games, defeating the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, but lost to the defending NFL champion Chicago Bears. Along with the Western All-Army team led by Duke University's Wallace Wade, the games raised $241,392.29 for the fund. In World War II, Neyland served in the China-Burma-India Theater, supervising the transportation of material through monsoons and across the Himalayas to the troops commanded by General \\"Vinegar\\" Joe Stillwell. During his military career he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit and made a member of the Order of the British Empire. He retired from military service a second time, in 1946, with the rank of brigadier general, and again returned to the Vols as coach through 1952. After producing mediocre teams in the late forties, many thought that the General had lost his touch, as more teams moved toward the \\"T formation\\" and Neyland continued running the single wing. Neyland was vindicated, however, as he ended his career with a flourish. His 1950 team was crowned national champion by several minor outlets, while his 1951 team won the school's first undisputed national championship, the first year the Volunteers ended a season ranked first in either the AP or UPI poll. He remained as athletic director at the university until his death in New Orleans in March 1962. Neyland at Army tossing a pass. Shortly before his death, Neyland drew up plans for a major expansion and renovation to the Vols' home stadium, Shields‚ÄìWatkins Field. When he had arrived in Knoxville in 1925, Shields‚ÄìWatkins Field seated only 3,200 people‚Äîbarely a fraction of the capacity of Vanderbilt's Dudley Field. Reflecting the Vols' rise to national prominence under his watch, the stadium's capacity had jumped to over 46,000 seats‚Äîan over 14-fold increase‚Äîin the 36 years since then. UT renamed the stadium Neyland Stadium in his honor prior to the 1962 season, and the plans he drew up were so far ahead of their time that they have been used as the basis for every major expansion since then. Playing career and education Neyland attended Burleson Junior College in his home town of Greenville, Texas for a year and then transferred to Texas A&M; playing football a year before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, where he starred as a football lineman and baseball pitcher and was the academy boxing champion. The National League baseball New York Giants offered him a $3,500 contract, which he turned down. Instead, Neyland served overseas briefly in World War I, then returned to get his engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then moving to West Point as aide-de-camp to Superintendent Douglas MacArthur. Family Tombstone of General Neyland at Knoxville National Cemetery On July 16, 1923, Neyland married Ada \\"Peggy\\" Fitch (September 1, 1897 ‚Äì March 7, 1976) of Grand Rapids, Michigan. They had met while she was visiting friends at the Academy. Ada was the daughter of Charles Lewis Fitch (July 24, 1845 ‚Äì September 8, 1930) and Mary S. (June 1853 ‚Äì ?). They had two sons, Robert, Jr., born February 11, 1930, and Lewis, December 6, 1933 ‚Äî 2013. General Neyland was the son of lawyer Robert Reece Neyland, Sr. (October 1859 ‚Äì 1935) and Pauline Lewis Neyland (January 1861 ‚Äì December 1932). His siblings were sister Carroll M. Neyland (January 1890 ‚Äì 1965) and brother Mayo W. Neyland (March 1896 ‚Äì November 1969). Both General Neyland and Ada are buried in Knoxville National Cemetery. Neyland Scholarship In late 1961, Neyland began working on a plan for supporters of UT athletic teams to show their interest in UT's academic programs by offering scholarships to attract outstanding student scholars to the University. General Neyland himself was an outstanding scholar, as well as an athlete during his college days at West Point. It was the General's dream that the University offer four-year academic merit scholarships to students who possessed outstanding academic and leadership qualities. Following Neyland's death in early 1962, Dr. Andrew D. Holt, then UT president, announced that a nationwide campaign would be launched to raise a minimum of $100,000 to establish the Robert R. Neyland Scholarship Fund. In October 1962, at half-time of the UT vs. Alabama game, 165 women representing UT's sororities collected more than $10,000 in a 15-minute time period at Neyland Stadium to launch the effort. By the end of fall 1962, more than $65,000 had been committed to the Neyland Scholarship fund. In the spring of 1963, a decision was made that proceeds from the annual Orange and White spring football game would go to help build the Neyland Scholarship Fund. The first Neyland Scholarships were awarded in 1963. The first two recipients were Melissa Ann Baker of Maryville, Tennessee (now Mrs. Ann Baker Furrow, a former member of the UT Board of Trustees) and Mr. Robert English Allen of Columbia, Tennessee. Seven Maxims of Football During the 1930s, Neyland began having his teams recite seven sentences that he felt summarized everything it took to win a game. These came to be known as \\"the Seven Maxims of Football\\", or \\"the Seven Game Maxims.\\" *The team that makes the fewest mistakes will win. *Play for and make the breaks and when one comes your way ‚Äì SCORE. *If at first the game ‚Äì or the breaks ‚Äì go against you, don't let up... put on more steam. *Protect our kickers, our QB, our lead and our ball game. *Ball, oskie, cover, block, cut and slice, pursue and gang tackle... for this is the WINNING EDGE. *Press the kicking game.

A mating pool is a concept used in evolutionary computation, which refers to a family of algorithms used to solve optimization and search problems.Regupathi, R. ‚ÄúCost Optimization Of Multistoried Rc Framed Structure Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm.‚Äù International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), vol. 04, no. 07, July 2017, p. 890., www.irjet.net/archives/V4/i7/IRJET-V4I7211.pdf. The mating pool is formed by candidate solutions that the selection operators deem to have the highest fitness in the current population. Solutions that are included in the mating pool are referred to as parents. Individual solutions can be repeatedly included in the mating pool, with individuals of higher fitness values having a higher chance of being included multiple times. Crossover operators are then applied to the parents, resulting in recombination of genes recognized as superior. Lastly, random changes in the genes are introduced through mutation operators, increasing the genetic variation in the gene pool. Those two operators improve the chance of creating new, superior solutions. A new generation of solutions is thereby created, the children, who will constitute the next population. Depending on the selection method, the total number of parents in the mating pool can be different to the size of the initial population, resulting in a new population that‚Äôs smaller. To continue the algorithm with an equally sized population, random individuals from the old populations can be chosen and added to the new population. At this point, the fitness value of the new solutions is evaluated. If the termination conditions are fulfilled, processes come to an end. Otherwise, they are repeated. The repetition of the steps result in candidate solutions that evolve towards the most optimal solution over time. The genes will become increasingly uniform towards the most optimal gene, a process called convergence. If 95% of the population share the same version of a gene, the gene has converged. When all the individual fitness values have reached the value of the best individual, i.e. all the genes have converged, population convergence is achieved.Beasley, D., Bull, D. R., & Martin, R. R. (1993). An overview of genetic algorithms: Part 1, fundamentals. University computing, 15(2), 56-69.  Mating pool creation  Parental selection methods used in the creation of a mating pool. Several methods can be applied to create a mating pool. All of these processes involve the selective breeding of a particular number of individuals within a population. There are multiple criteria that can be employed to determine which individuals make it into the mating pool and which are left behind. The selection methods can be split into three general types: fitness proportionate selection, ordinal based selection and threshold based selection.  Fitness proportionate selection  In the case of fitness proportionate selection, random individuals are selected to enter the pool. However, the ones with a higher level of fitness are more likely to be picked and therefore have a greater chance of passing on their features to the next generation. One of the techniques used in this type of parental selection is the roulette wheel selection. This approach divides a hypothetical circular wheel into different slots, the size of which is equal to the fitness values of each potential candidate. Afterwards, the wheel is rotated and a fixed point determines which individual gets picked. The greater the fitness value of an individual, the higher the probability of being chosen as a parent by the random spin of the wheel. Alternatively, stochastic universal sampling can be implemented. This selection method is also based on the rotation of a spinning wheel. However, in this case there is more than one fixed point and as a result all of the mating pool members will be selected simultaneously.  Ordinal based selection  The ordinal based selection methods include the tournament and ranking selection. Tournament selection involves the random selection of individuals of a population and the subsequent comparison of their fitness levels. The winners of these ‚Äútournaments‚Äù are the ones with the highest values and will be put into the mating pool as parents. In ranking selection all the individuals are sorted based on their fitness values. Then, the selection of the parents is made according to the rank of the candidates. Every individual has a chance of being chosen, but higher ranked ones are favored  Threshold based selection  The last type of selection method is referred to as the threshold based method. This includes the truncation selection method, which sorts individuals based on their phenotypic values on a specific trait and later selects the proportion of them that are within a certain threshold as parents.

In industrial usage, this may be used to inflate car or bicycle tyres or power tools worked by compressed air, for breathing apparatus in hazardous environments and to operate many other pneumatic systems.https://www.ciscoair.com/applications-compressed-air/ Air lines provide compressed air for a wide range of uses and to cater for a variety of uses air lines are manufactured in a range of corrosion-resistant materials. Typically air lines are made with flexible hose or rigid pipe. Air line hoses provide flexibility and mobility for use, whereas a piped air line is more permanent and resistant to damage. For a typical compressed air system, both types of air lines are used in conjunction. Air Line Hose Two types of air line hose Air line hoses are flexible tubes used to convey pressurised air. They are commonly used for carrying a supply of compressed air to operate pneumatic powered systems, such as a road vehicle air brake system for large vehicles and a railway air brake system for railway carriages / locomotives.https://www.ciscoair.com/applications-compressed-air/ Due to the versatility of a flexible compressed air supply hoses are also used for pneumatic hand tools, pneumatic robotics and for connections to air powered equipment. Hose air lines are manufactured with anti-corrosion & abrasion resistant materials, to prevent internal corrosion from air moisture/condensate and from external abrasion when in use. Air line hoses are manufactured in a number of materials, meaning each type of hose can provide different characteristics to suit its use. Some important characteristics include flexibility, weight & manoeuvrability.https://www.air- compressorsdirect.co.uk/airline-hose Commonly used materials for Air Line Hose * Rubber ‚Äì Most commonly used * Hybrid Material ‚Äì A combination of polyurethane, PVC, and rubber * PVC * Polyurethane https://www.sgs- engineering.com/help-advice/choose-perfect-compressor-air-hose/# A wide range of hose sizes & materials are available to accommodate the different pressures, flow rates & of its intended use. There are two types of air line hose which are most commonly used. The two types are known as Standard (straight) and Recoil (coiled) hose types. The outer diameter size of air line hoses are manufactured in both imperial and metric unit systems. Fixed Pipe Air Lines The term air line is also used to describe fixed pipe compressed air systems. These systems are often found in laboratories, workshops, manufacturing facilities & on other sites for industrial processes. Fixed pipe air lines can also found onboard large shipping vessels, as compressed air is used to rotate the engines for starting up. Large diameter pipework systems are used for air lines that convey compressed air over great distances, these are typically found on large industrial sites & research facilities. Fixed pipe systems are typically connected to a large industrial compressor, located remotely, in a plant room or dedicated space. The compressed air lines will be piped from the compressor to one or multiple point of use outlets. At the outlet of a fixed air line you will typically find a Pressure regulator installed upstream of the termination/outlet point, this allows the user to regulate the pressure and flow of air to suit the desired use. The regulator allows each outlet to be controlled independently, even though they are served by a common compressor and connected to the same system. As with hose air lines, Fixed pipe air lines must be manufactured with anti-corrosion materials, such as non-ferrous metals or plastics, to prevent internal corrosion from air moisture content and condensate. Commonly used materials for piped air line systems * Aluminium - smooth bore, energy efficient pipework * Galvanised carbon steel - medium and heavy weight pipework systems * Stainless steel and copper compression jointed systems * Plastics, ABS and MDPE pipework systems https://www.sgs-engineering.com/help-advice/choose- perfect-compressor-air-hose/# Piped air lines are typically installed with a fall gradient away from the outlet point, this is to allow any build-up of moisture within the pipework (due to internal condensation) to drain via the automatic tank drain or via a drain leg installed on the system.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KKCwfvqoNs Branch connections to serve outlets are typically taken vertically off the top of the main supply line and then loop down to the outlet point. This is done as a safety precaution and to avoid damaging pneumatic equipment. A connection into the top of a main air line greatly reduces the risk of Condensation water or particulates being discharged at high velocity through the outlet.http://www.parkertransair.com/jahia/Jahia/lang/en_GB/filiale/czech/home/TechnicalCenter/CompressedAirPipeSystem  References  Category:Tools ","title":"Air line"},{"id":"1514580","text":"Worcestershire Beacon, also popularly known as Worcester Beacon, or locally simply as The Beacon, is a hill whose summit at is the highest point of the range of Malvern Hills that runs about north-south along the Herefordshire- Worcestershire border, although Worcestershire Beacon itself lies entirely within Worcestershire. The hills are managed by the Malvern Hills Conservators under five Acts of Parliament of 1884, 1909, 1924, 1930, and 1995 whose aim is to preserve the nature and environment landscape of the area and to protect it from encroachments. The Beacon is highly popular with walkers with its easily reached dense network of footpaths crisscrossing it and the area has been designated by the Countryside Agency as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Toponymy The name Beacon comes from the use of the hill as a signalling beacon.beacon n. A fire (usually on a hill or tower) that can be seen from a distance; (Ultralingua English Dictionary 2009) Lord Macaulay included the Beacon in his poem Armada, which describes the chain of warning fires which were lit when the Spanish Armada attempted to invade England in 1588: > And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still > All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill > Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o‚Äôer Darwin‚Äôs rocky dales > Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales, > Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern‚Äôs lonely height, > Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin‚Äôs crest of light.Thomas > Macaulay, The Armada. Geography Toposcope on Worcestershire Beacon, with North Hill beyond The steep eastern flank of the hill begins immediately behind Bellevue Terrace, one of the two main shopping streets in the town centre of Great Malvern from where its summit is a brisk 35 ‚Äì 40 minutes steep walk via St Ann's Well or Happy Valley. It can also be accessed by a short, steep, unpathed climb from Jubilee Drive on the western side, or reached by a more leisurely stroll along the crest of the ridge from a car park near the Wyche Cutting, a mile or so to the south of the town centre. The Beacon affords an extensive panoramic viewWorcestershire Beacon computer generated summit panoramas that includes the Lickey Hills near Redditch, The Wrekin and past Birmingham to Cannock Chase, as well as much of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, the Welsh border mountains, the Shropshire Hills and across the valleys of the Severn and Avon to the Cotswold Hills. Parts of thirteen counties, the Bristol Channel, and the cathedrals of Worcester, Gloucester and Hereford can be seen. Running due east from Worcestershire Beacon, the next highest point of land is on the western slope of the Ural Mountains. Panorama looking towards Cheltenham and Gloucester from summit Geology The hills are mostly igneous and metamorphic rocks from the late pre-Cambrian, around 600 million years old and the Beacon is part of the watershed that permits the rise of the mineral springs and wells of the famous Malvern water that is bottled commercially on a large scale and sold worldwide, and they were responsible for the development of Malvern from a village to a busy spa town in the early 19th century. Hundreds of millions of years of erosion and glacial passage have given the Beacon and its neighbouring peaks their characteristic smoothly rounded features. History The Shire Ditch forms a shallow trough just to the right of the ridge all the way to the top of the Beacon Diamond Jubilee Toposcope. Designed by Arthur Troyte Griffith and erected to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 The hill itself appears to mark the northern terminal of the Shire Ditch, or Red Earl's Dyke, which runs north and south of the British Camp along the ridge of the hills. It was created in 1287 by Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, following a boundary dispute with Thomas de Cantilupe, the Bishop of Hereford.Palmer, R. 1992, The Folklore of Hereford and Worcester. Oxford University Press Recent research has shown that the Shire Ditch might actually be much older. Indeed, there is some evidence that it may have started life as a prehistoric trackway running from Worcestershire Beacon to Midsummer Hillfort. The hill is also the site of two Bronze Age burials. In 1849 two urns containing bones and ashes were uncovered by Private Harkiss whilst conducting work for the Ordnance Survey and documented by Edwin Lees, a local antiquarian. The remains were attributed to the Middle Bronze Age and are now housed in the British Museum. The Worcestershire Beacon has historically been used as a location for signalling beacons. In 1588 it formed part of a chain of warning fires which were lit when the Spanish Armada attempted to invade England. Beacon fires were also lit to celebrate national occasions including the end of the Crimean War (1856), the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales (1863), the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria (1887) and Diamond Jubilee (1897) the coronation of George V (1911) and the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (1953). In recent years it has been used as a beacon for special occasions such as the millennium night of 31 December 1999 when a large fire was lit as part of a nationwide network of hill top beacons to celebrate the event. A beacon fire was also lit on the Worcestershire Beacon on 3 June 2002 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II and on 4 June 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. On the summit is a viewfinder or toposcope, identifying the hills to be seen on a clear day; it was designed by Malvern architect Arthur Troyte Griffith, a friend of Sir Edward Elgar and erected in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. It was stolen in 2000 and replaced by Malvern Hills Conservators the same year. The original was returned to the Conservators in 2001. During World War II the Beacon was used as a fire lookout point for air raids on Birmingham and Coventry, and in the latter half of the 20th century it was used regularly as a location for a BBC transmitter relay van for covering horse racing and sports events in Worcester. Beacon cafe A caf√© that had existed on the summit for many decades was destroyed by fire in 1989. As the Malvern Hills Acts state that no building should be erected on the Conservators' land or on land under their jurisdiction, the Conservators put a bill through Parliament to get the power to build a new one but the House of Lords opposed it. When the cafe was burned down, the Conservators had plans to replace the building but were advised that they risked prosecution for rebuilding as the original cafe building was an encroachment on common land. The Malvern Hills Bill was in preparation to modernise some of the clauses in previous acts a clause was inserted to gain authority to rebuild the cafe. Five members of the House of Lords Select Committee visited the Malvern Hills and decided that there were enough facilities in the immediate area and that St Ann's Well cafe should be enough provision on the hills, so the application to rebuild was turned down. In cultural life=Television The West of England Quarry on the Worcestershire Beacon was used as a location in the Doctor Who serial The Krotons, starring Patrick Troughton. The serial was broadcast in four weekly parts from 28 December 1968 to 18 January 1969.

Both his silent comic La Mouche and Kaput and Z√∂sky have been made into animated cartoons. He explained his choice of pseudonym after the Norwegian city of Trondheim as follows: \\"As a last name I wanted to use a city's name, but Lewis Bordeaux or Lewis Toulouse didn't sound so good. Then I thought about this city, Trondheim‚Ä¶ Maybe someday I will publish a book under my real name, in order to remain anonymous.\\"Translated from Trondheim's presentation page (in German) on the website of his German publisher Biography Lewis Trondheim was first known as the author of Les formidables aventures de Lapinot (later to be translated to English as The Spiffy Adventures of McConey). He invented the character in the late 1980s as a way to learn cartooning. The result was an initial 500 page graphic novel, Lapinot et les carottes de Patagonie. All the while, he was publishing short stories for the satirical French magazine Psikopat. After his book Slaloms was awarded what was then called the Alph'Art Coup de coeur (First comic book prize) in 1993, Trondheim was offered to bring his burgeoning series to a major publisher, Dargaud, while he continued churning out more personal books for L'Association and other independent French publishers such as Corn√©lius. From there onwards, Trondheim began to enjoy a steady rise in popularity. The following years represented a period of increasing activity, as Trondheim began to work on many different projects. He first created La Mouche (\\"The Fly\\") for the Japanese market, and then redrew a French version from scratch, after which the character was adapted as an animated cartoon. Trondheim's greatest breakthrough after Lapinot is arguably Dungeon (in French, Donjon), an ambitious series which he created with Joann Sfar, and which has enjoyed a fair amount of popular success. In 1993, he married Brigitte Findakly, a comic colorist and screenwriter. Trondheim's \\"retirement\\" In 2004, after a long and intensive period during which he steadily released new books at a frantic pace, Lewis Trondheim announced he was more or less retiring from the world of comic strips, stating he did not want his passion to become a \\"job\\". He did draw and write a few stories within the following year, including a book reflecting on his decision to slow down, though the releases occurred at a much slower pace. It has long been speculated he used this time partly to create another ambitious work, Le blog de Frantico, which was a comic strip blog published daily on the web for a whole year under the Frantico pseudonym. In interviews and on his web sites, Trondheim alternately admits and denies having written Le blog de Frantico, though another author, S√©bastien Lesage eventually stepped up and claimed to be the real author, saying he had asked Trondheim to help him maintain the mystery. To this day however, the true identity of Frantico remains unconfirmed. Another recent Trondheim occupation is that of editorial director at Delcourt, where he manages Shampooing, a collection of comic books for young readers. In 2006, Trondheim was awarded the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul√™me at the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival, arguably the most prestigious award in the field.

December 3, 2016. Bibliography Trondheim has written or drawn more than a hundred titles, spanning a large spectrum of genres; some of the most notable are: * The Spiffy Adventures of McConey (Les formidables aventures de Lapinot; 10 official volumes), which mix satire and fantasy. The main characters are all animals: for instance McConey is a shy and easygoing rabbit, while Richard is an engaging cat with a loud mouth and a knack for getting into trouble. The stories alternate between modern France and stock historical settings. The recurring characters in the series can be thought of as actors who don't always play the same people, but always play the same type of roles. * Dungeon (Donjon; more than 30 volumes), co-written with Joann Sfar, an extremely ambitious series which attempts to chronicle a Dungeons & Dragons-like dungeon through three separate epochs. The tone varies from heroic to comic to rather dark. * Several children comics, among them: Le roi catastrophe (8 volumes), drawn by Fabrice Parme, a series about a boy king; Monstrueux (3 volumes), featuring a young French family resembling Trondheim's, and their pet monster Jean-Christophe; Kaput and Z√∂sky (2 volumes), featuring space aliens, which in recent years, has been converted into a television program; and more recently A.L.I.E.E.E.N., an \\"alien children book\\" Trondheim jokingly claims to have found in a country field while on vacation. * Collections of short, modern comic strip fables, sometimes starring simplified, potato-shaped characters, the bulk of which has been published by L'Association (Gen√®ses apocalyptiques, Non, non, non, Le pays des trois sourires, etc.) * Autobiographical comics, such as those collected in Approximate Continuum Comics, which later formed his book Approximativement; as well as his more recent Carnet de bord series (3 volumes). Newer autobiographical comics are regularly published on his blog under the title Les petits riens (serialized in English paperback volumes as Little Nothings). * Various conceptual comics, such as Le dormeur and Psychanalyse, both of which were created entirely with a single photocopied panel, while Bleu and La nouvelle pornographie are both billed as \\"abstract comic books\\". After Psychanalyse, Trondheim was challenged by J.C. Menu to write a story with only 4 different panels, drawn by Menu. After some strips, Trondheim asked for four more panels, and wrote the highly dense comic book, Moins d'un quart de seconde pour vivre. Such constrained writing achievements, reminiscent of OuLiPo writers, were a huge incentive for OuBaPo's creation. English translations Two volumes of McConey have been published in English by Fantagraphics in editions close to the original. In 2018 Dargaud also began releasing English translations with the title The Marvelous Adventures of McConey under the Europe Comics label. As of April 2018 three volumes have been published. Fantagraphics has additionally published a range of shorter pieces by Trondheim in the comic The Nimrod. NBM has published Dungeon, both in comic book and graphic novel formats, as well as Little Nothings, a collection of autobiographical one-page vignettes. English versions of A.L.I.E.E.N. (retitled A.L.I.E.E.E.N.) and Le Roi Catastrophe (retitled Tiny Tyrant) have been published by First Second.

It is located in the north of the city, in the former City of North York, which was merged with five other municipalities and a regional government to form the new \\"City of Toronto\\" in 1998. Parkway Forest is bounded on the west by Don Mills Road, on the north by Sheppard Avenue, on the east by the Don Valley Parkway, and on the south by Highway 401. It is contained within the city's officially designated neighbourhood of Henry Farm, although it is distinct in character from the residential community of that same name west of Don Mills Road. Parkway Forest is part of Ward 17 in the Toronto City Council, part of the new Don Valley North federal electoral district, and part of the Don Valley East provincial electoral district. Parkway Forest is primarily residential, with luxury condominiums, high-rise rental apartment buildings, low-rise rental apartment buildings and townhouse complexes. The community has a large open park (Parkway Forest Park), a firehouse, a community center with outdoor pool, a shopping plaza (Parkway Forest Plaza) consisting of the neighbourhood's main grocery store (Foodland), and a public school (Forest Manor Public School) which goes from junior kindergarten to Grade 5. During the summer months, you can find many families with children playing in the large open park. It sits directly to the south of the Fairview Mall shopping centre, and is served by the Don Mills subway station on the Toronto Transit Commission's Sheppard subway line.

Scott (born December 2, 1936) is an American political scientist and anthropologist. He is a comparative scholar of agrarian and non-state societies, subaltern politics, and anarchism. His primary research has centered on peasants of Southeast Asia and their strategies of resistance to various forms of domination. The New York Times described his research as \\"highly influential and idiosyncratic\\". Scott received his bachelor's degree from Williams College and his MA and PhD in political science from Yale. He taught at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison until 1976 and then at Yale, where he is Sterling Professor of Political Science. Since 1991 he has directed Yale's Program in Agrarian Studies. He lives in Durham, Connecticut, where he once raised sheep. Early life and career Scott was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, in 1936. He attended the Moorestown Friends School, a Quaker Day School, and in 1953 matriculated at Williams College in Massachusetts. On the advice of Indonesia scholar William Hollinger he wrote an honors thesis on the economic development of Burma. Upon graduation, Scott received a Rotary International Fellowship to study in Burma, where he was recruited by an American student activist who had become an anti-communist organizer for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Scott agreed to do reporting for the agency, and at the end of his fellowship, took a post in the Paris office of the National Student Association, which accepted CIA money and direction in working against communist-controlled global student movements over the next few years. Scott began graduate study in political science at Yale in 1961. His dissertation on political ideology in Malaysia, which was supervised by Robert E. Lane, analyzed interviews with Malaysian civil servants. In 1967, he took a position as an assistant professor in political science at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. As a Southeast Asia specialist teaching during the Vietnam War, he offered popular courses on the war and peasant revolutions. In 1976, having earned tenure at Madison, Scott returned to Yale and settled on a farm in Durham, Connecticut with his wife. They started with a small farm, then purchased a larger one nearby in the early 1980s and began raising sheep for their wool. Since 2011, the pastures on the farm have been grazed by two Highland cattle, named Fife and Dundee. Scott's first books were based on archival research. He is an influential scholar of ethnographic fieldwork. He is unusual for conducting his primary ethnographic fieldwork only after receiving tenure. To research his third book, Weapons of the Weak, Scott spent fourteen months in a village in Kedah, Malaysia between 1978 and 1980. When he had finished a draft, he returned for two months to solicit villagers' impressions of his depiction, and significantly revised the book based on their criticisms and insight. Major works James Scott's work focuses on the ways that subaltern people resist domination. The Moral Economy of the Peasant During the Vietnam War, Scott took an interest in Vietnam and wrote The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia (1976) about the ways peasants resisted authority. His main argument is that peasants prefer the patron-client relations of the \\"moral economy\\", in which wealthier peasants protect weaker ones. When these traditional forms of solidarity break down due to the introduction of market forces, rebellion (or revolution) is likely. Samuel Popkin, in his book The Rational Peasant (1979), tried to refute this argument, showing that peasants are also rational actors who prefer free markets to exploitation by local elites. Scott and Popkin thus represent two radically different positions in the formalist‚Äìsubstantivist debate in political anthropology. Weapons of the Weak In Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1985) Scott expanded his theories to peasants in other parts of the world. Scott's theories are often contrasted with Gramscian ideas about hegemony. Against Gramsci, Scott argues that the everyday resistance of subalterns shows that they have not consented to dominance. Domination and the Arts of Resistance In Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts (1990) argues that all subordinate groups employ strategies of resistance that go unnoticed by superordinate groups, which he terms \\"infrapolitics.\\" Scott describes the open, public interactions between dominators and oppressed as a \\"public transcript\\" and the critique of power that goes on offstage as a \\"hidden transcript.\\" Groups under domination‚Äîfrom bonded labor to sexual violence‚Äîthus cannot be understood merely by their public actions, which may appear acquiescent. In order to study the systems of domination, careful attention is paid to what lies beneath the surface of evident, public behavior. In public, those that are oppressed accept their domination, but they always question their domination offstage. On the event of a publicization of this \\"hidden transcript\\", oppressed classes openly assume their speech, and become conscious of its common status. Seeing Like a State Scott's book Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1998) saw his first major foray into political science. In it, he showed how central governments attempt to force legibility on their subjects, and fail to see complex, valuable forms of local social order and knowledge. A main theme of this book, illustrated by his historic examples, is that states operate systems of power toward 'legibility' in order to 'see' their subjects correctly in a top-down, modernist, model that is flawed, problematic, and often ends poorly for subjects. The goal of local 'legibility' by the state is 'transparency' from the top down, from the top of the tower or the center/seat of the government, so the state can effectively operate upon their subjects. The details and arguments amplify Foucault's central notions of governmentality and operations of power. Scott uses examples like the introduction of permanent last names in Great Britain, cadastral surveys in France, and standard units of measure across Europe to argue that a reconfiguration of social order is necessary for state scrutiny, and requires the simplification of pre-existing, natural arrangements. In the case of last names, Scott cites a Welsh man who appeared in court and identified himself with a long string of patronyms: \\"John, ap Thomas ap William\\" etc. In his local village, this naming system carried a lot of information, because people could identify him as the son of Thomas and grandson of William, and thus distinguish him from the other Johns and the other grandchildren of Thomas. Yet it was of less use to the central government, which did not know Thomas or William. The court demanded that John take a permanent last name (in this case, the name of his village). This helped the central government keep track of its subjects, but it lost local information. Scott argues that in order for schemes to improve the human condition to succeed, they must take into account local conditions, and that the high-modernist ideologies of the 20th century have prevented this. He highlights collective farms in the Soviet Union, the building of Brasilia, and Prussian forestry techniques as examples of failed schemes. The Art of Not Being Governed In The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia, Scott addresses the question of how certain groups in the mountainous jungles of Southeast Asia managed to avoid a package of exploitation centered around the state, taxation, and grain cultivation. Certain aspects of their society seen by outsiders as backward (e.g., limited literacy and use of written language) were in fact part of the \\"Arts\\" referenced in the title: limiting literacy meant lower visibility to the state. Scott's main argument is that these people are \\"barbaric by design\\": their social organization, geographical location, subsistence practices and culture have been carved to discourage states to annex them to their territories. Addressing identity in the Introduction, he wrote: Against the Grain Published in August 2017, Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States is an account of new evidence for the beginnings of the earliest civilizations that contradict the standard narrative. Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture; the advantages of mobile subsistence; the unforeseeable epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain; and why all early states are based on millets, cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the ‚Äúbarbarians‚Äù who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples. Other works In Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity, and Meaningful Work and Play from 2012 Scott says that \\"Lacking a comprehensive anarchist worldview and philosophy, and in any case wary of nomothetic ways of seeing, I am making a case for a sort of anarchist squint. What I aim to show is that if you put on anarchist glasses and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics, and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle. It will also become apparent that anarchist principles are active in the aspirations and political action of people who have never heard of anarchism or anarchist philosophy.\\" Awards and fellowships Scott is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has been awarded resident fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the Science, Technology and Society Program at M.I.T.. He has also received research grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Guggenheim Foundation, and was president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1997.

Mercury(II) oxide is a solid at room temperature and pressure. The mineral form montroydite is very rarely found. History In 1774, Joseph Priestley discovered that oxygen was released by heating mercuric oxide, although he did not identify the gas as oxygen (rather, Priestley called it \\"dephlogisticated air,\\" as that was the paradigm that he was working under at the time). Synthesis Montroydite structure (red atoms are oxygens) Cinnabar structure The red form of HgO can be made by heating Hg in oxygen at roughly 350 ¬∞C, or by pyrolysis of Hg(NO3)2. The yellow form can be obtained by precipitation of aqueous Hg2+ with alkali. The difference in color is due to particle size, both forms have the same structure consisting of near linear O-Hg-O units linked in zigzag chains with an Hg-O-Hg angle of 108¬∞. Structure Under atmospheric pressure mercuric oxide has two crystalline forms: one is called montroydite (orthorhombic, 2/m 2/m 2/m, Pnma), and the second is analogous to the sulfide mineral cinnabar (hexagonal, hP6, P3221); both are characterized by Hg-O chains. At pressures above 10 GPa both structures convert to a tetragonal form. Uses HgO is sometimes used in the production of mercury as it decomposes quite easily. When it decomposes, oxygen gas is generated. It is also used as a material for cathodes for mercury batteries. Health issues The label on an HgO powder bottle. Mercury oxide is a highly toxic substance which can be absorbed into the body by inhalation of its aerosol, through the skin and by ingestion. The substance is irritating to the eyes, the skin and the respiratory tract and may have effects on the kidneys, resulting in kidney impairment. In the food chain important to humans, bioaccumulation takes place, specifically in aquatic organisms. The substance is banned as a pesticide in the EU. Evaporation at 20 ¬∞C is negligible. HgO decomposes on exposure to light or on heating above 500 ¬∞C. Heating produces highly toxic mercury fumes and oxygen, which increases the fire hazard. Mercury(II) oxide reacts violently with reducing agents, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium (when heated), disulfur dichloride and hydrogen trisulfide. Shock-sensitive compounds are formed with metals and elements such as sulfur and phosphorus.

In 1895, John Herron bequeathed most of his fortune (almost $250,000) to the Association, which was headed by suffragette May Wright Sewall. Herron stipulated that the money be used to build a museum and art school in his name. (Based on inflation, $250,000 in 1895 would be equivalent to $7,002,734 in 2014). ;1900s Due to Herron's gift, the John Herron Art Institute was formed in 1902 in Indianapolis to serve as an art museum and an art school. The Institute's Herron Museum, an Italian Renaissance Reviva-style building, was designed by Vonnegut and Bohn architects and located at 1701 North Pennsylvania Street in the present-day Morton Place. The Institute's main building was designed by Paul Philippe Cret in 1929, and was the second facility in the nation designed specifically for art education. The first core faculty included Indiana Impressionist painters of the Hoosier Group: T.C. Steele, J. Ottis Adams, William Forsyth, Richard Gruelle, and Otto Stark. The sculptor Rudolph Schwarz was also in the first core faculty. 200px IUPUI campus sign for Herron School of Art and Design. ;1960s Fesler Hall (1962), a major addition to the former John Herron Art Institute site along North Pennsylvania was Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III's first civic commission. The three-story academic building was a freestanding wing addition that connected via covered walkway to the original, Cret-designed main building. Both of these structures are still standing. Woollen's addition was noted for its use of reinforced concrete and exposed columns, which are typical of Brutalist architecture, and its deeply coffered ceilings. See: \\"Biographical\\" Sketch in See also: Mary Ellen Gadski, \\"Woollen, Molzan and Partners\\" in See also: The project was funded through a bequest of Caroline Marmon Fesler, a former board member and president of the Indianapolis Art Association (which became the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1969). In 1967, the Herron School of Art became a school of Indiana University. Two years later, it became part of IUPUI‚ÄîIndiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, located near downtown Indianapolis. In 1970, the Indianapolis Museum of Art separated from the school, taking with it a majority of Herron's art collection. left Eskenazi Hall entrance, Herron School of Art and Design, IUPUI campus. ;2000s The Herron School of Art and Design launched a capital campaign to raise funds for new buildings in 1999, and in 2000 a ceramic arts facility was opened. In 2003 The Herron Chronicle was published detailing the past 100 years of the school's history. In 2005, Eskenazi Hall, the current home of the school, was completed. This facility tripled the amount of space available to Herron students and includes a library, a 240-seat auditorium, of gallery space, and several computer labs. The original Herron art school's buildings now house Herron High School, a classical liberal arts charter high school. They are within the Herron-Morton Place Historic District. Benefactors Caroline Marmon Fesler: The daughter of local industrialist and automobile manufacturer Daniel W. Marmon (Ray Harroun drove a Marmon car to victory in the first Indianapolis 500 race in 1911), she studied painting in Europe. Later, she became a well-known art collector, especially of 20th-century modernist works, many of which she later gave to the Herron Museum‚Äîincluding Grey Hills by her friend, Georgia O'Keeffe. Along with Sullivan, Fesler propelled the Herron Museum into the era of modern art. Herman C. Krannert: Founder and president of Inland Container Corporation, Krannert agreed to take charge of the Art Association in 1960, at a point when the organization was struggling to stay afloat. Krannert insisted the group reorganize its board and its way of doing business, including creating the position of board chairman‚Äîhe became the first person to have that title and he held it for 12 years. His tenure culminated in the relocation of the Museum from the Herron campus at 16th and Pennsylvania streets to its current 38th St. and Michigan Road site, and the Art Association's name changed to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Titina Loizidou, and consequently all other refugees, have the right to return to their former properties.

Loizidou had been forced out of her home during Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974 along with around 200,000 other Greek-Cypriots. During more than 20 years, she made a number of attempts to return to her home in Kyrenia but was denied entry into the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), by the Turkish army. Her application resulted in three judgments by the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg) which held Turkey responsible for human rights violations in the northern part of Cyprus, which is under overall control of the Turkish armed forces. The U.S. Department of State commented on this case as follows: The Court also stated expressly that the damages awarded were not compensation for the property per se, but only for the denial of the ownership and use of the property, and that Loizidou retains full legal ownership of her property. In 2003 Turkey paid Loizidou the compensation amounts (of over $1 million) ruled by the European Court of Human Rights. Precedent  The case serves as important precedent for judgements in international courts of law regarding the Cyprus dispute. Similar cases have been brought to the ECHR are awaiting judgement and two have been concluded in a similar fashion: * May 2007: Myra Xenides v. Turkey, where Myra Xenides was awarded damages for loss of use of her property in Famagusta. * April 2008: Demades vs Turkey, where Ioannis Demades was awarded damages amounting to ‚Ç¨835,000 for loss of use of his Kyrenia property.

Limited vendor hardware support has been a barrier to its acceptance. Notably, despite being open source, FXT1 was not adopted by Nintendo for the GameCube, nor by Sony for the PlayStation 3, in both cases losing out to the established S3TC standard. Another possible reason for its lack of adoption is that the CC_MIXED mode (see below) probably infringes the S3TC patent (). Four different compression algorithms are used by FXT1, chosen at a block level to optimize visual quality. Having to select an optimal path for each texture, ensured FXT1 was relatively slow at compression, making it unsuitable for real-time compression in applications. The original white paper did not follow well-known scientific rules, being actually a commercial presentation. The lack of theoretical guidance from the inventors might have been the cause of badly optimized compression scheme selection code, and despite potentially better performance due to four available compression schemes instead of one (as in S3TC), FXT1 did not show any quality improvements to S3TC, being inferior to it in most test cases. In hindsight, FXT1 might have been more successful if 3dfx spent more effort examining optimization of the CC_MIXED compression mode, more similar to S3TC, and dropped the other three codecs from the standard. 3dfx was subsequently taken over by Nvidia who have continued to support S3TC as their preferred compression tool.  Compression algorithms  Four different compression algorithms are set out in the original white paper: 1\\\\. CC_MIXED (similar to other S3TC): A 4x4 texel block is represented by two bits-per-texel for opaque textures. Additionally, each block has two 16-bit colors stored in an RGB 565 format. The two RGB 565 colors and two additional colors (created by interpolating between the two RGB 565 colors) form the primary colors for this texel block and its associated four color lookup table. A 2-bit index is used to determine which color from the lookup table will be used for each texel in the 4x4 block. Transparent textures are created by making one of the four colors transparent. 2\\\\. CC_HI (best for spatial resolution): A 4√ó8 texel block is represented by three bits- per-texel for opaque and transparent textures. Each block stores two 15-bit colors in an RGB 555 format. The two RGB 555 colors and five additional colors (created by interpolating between the two RGB 555 colors) form the primary colors for this texel block. Additionally, an eighth color is defined to be the transparent color. A 3-bit index is used to determine which color from the 8-entry lookup table will be used for each texel in the 4x8 block. 3\\\\. CC_CHROMA (good at complex color areas): A 4√ó8 texel block is represented by two bits-per-texel for opaque textures. Each block stores four 15-bit colors in an RGB 555 format. All four colors are used directly with no interpolation to form a 4-entry lookup table. The 2-bit index assigned to each texel in the block is used to determine which of the four colors is assigned to each individual texel. Note that Colors4 only applies to opaque textures, as it does not support transparency. 4\\\\. CC_ALPHA (gives the best control over complex alpha transparencies at four bits-per-texel): A 4√ó8 texel block is represented by two bits-per-texel for opaque and transparent textures. Each block stores three 20-bit colors stored in a 5555 format. The first and second 20-bit colors are used for the primary colors of the left 4x4 block, while the second and third colors are used for the primary colors of the right 4√ó4 block. Two additional colors are created in each block by interpolating between the two primary colors for that block. A 2-bit index is assigned to each texel in the block and a lookup table is used to determine which color is applied to each texel.

He also recorded for AMPICO's reproducing piano system, which was installed in upper-line pianos such as Mason & Hamlin and Chickering. In 1921 Confrey wrote his novelty piano solo \\"Kitten on the Keys\\", inspired by hearing his grandmother's cat walk on the keyboard of her piano. It became a hit, and he went on to compose many other pieces in the genre. \\"Dizzy Fingers\\" (1923) was Confrey's other biggest seller. Following the 1920s, Confrey focused primarily on composing for jazz bands. He retired after World War II but continued to compose until 1959. He died at age 76 in Lakewood, New Jersey after suffering for many years from Parkinson's disease. He left behind more than a hundred piano works, songs and miniature operas, and numerous piano rolls, music publications and sound recordings. Writing in 2007 David A. Jasen describes Confrey, alongside Roy Bargy, as still \\"firmly rooted in the folk tradition\\".

It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on January 23, 1922.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 8, pp. 188-239. The United States convened a 13-nation conference of the International Opium Commission in 1909 in Shanghai, China, in response to increasing criticism of the opium trade. The treaty was signed by Germany, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Persia, Portugal, Russia, and Siam. The Convention provided, \\"The contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control, or to cause to be controlled, all persons manufacturing, importing, selling, distributing, and exporting morphine, cocaine, and their respective salts, as well as the buildings in which these persons carry such an industry or trade.\\" The Convention was implemented in 1915 by the United States, Netherlands, China, Honduras, and Norway. It went into force globally in 1919, when it was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles. The primary objective of the convention was to introduce restrictions on exports as opposed to imposing prohibition or criminalising the use and cultivation of opium, coca, and cannabis. That explains the withdrawal of the United States and China, which were gravitating towards prohibitionist approaches, as well as the beginning of negotiations leading to the 1925 International Opium Convention in Geneva.A Primer on the UN Drug Control Conventions. Transnational Institute. A revised International Opium Convention International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs was signed at Geneva on February 19, 1925, which went into effect on September 25, 1938, and was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on the same day.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 81, pp. 318-358.The beginnings of international drug control It introduced a statistical control system to be supervised by a Permanent Central Opium Board, a body of the League of Nations. Egypt, with support from China and United States, recommended that a prohibition on hashish be added to the Convention, and a sub-committee proposed the following text: > The use of Indian hemp and the preparations derived therefrom may only be > authorized for medical and scientific purposes. The raw resin (charas), > however, which is extracted from the female tops of the cannabis sativa L, > together with the various preparations (hashish, chira, esrar, diamba, etc.) > of which it forms the basis, not being at present utilized for medical > purposes and only being susceptible of utilisation for harmful purposes, in > the same manner as other narcotics, may not be produced, sold, traded in, > etc., under any circumstances whatsoever. India and other countries objected to this language, citing social and religious customs and the prevalence of wild-growing cannabis plants that would make it difficult to enforce. Accordingly, this provision never made it into the final treaty. A compromiseW.W. WILLOUGHBY: OPIUM AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM, BALTIMORE, THE JOHNS HOPKINS PRESS, 1925 was made that banned exportation of Indian hemp to countries that have prohibited its use, and requiring importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required \\"exclusively for medical or scientific purposes.\\" It also required Parties to \\"exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin.\\" These restrictions still left considerable leeway for countries to allow production, internal trade, and use of cannabis for recreational purposes.The cannabis problem: A note on the problem and the history of international action The Convention was superseded by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

convergence means that a population for an optimization problem converged too early, resulting in being suboptimal. In this context, the parental solutions, through the aid of genetic operators, are not able to generate offspring that are superior to, or outperform, their parents. Premature convergence is a common problem found in genetic algorithms, as it leads to a loss, or convergence of, a large number of alleles, subsequently making it very difficult to search for a specific gene in which the alleles were present.Leung, Y., et al. (1997). Degree of population diversity ‚Äì A perspective on premature convergence in genetic algorithms and its markov chain, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 8, pp. 1165 ‚Äì 1176.Baker, J.E. & Grefenstette, J. (2014). Proceedings of the First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications. Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, pp. 101 - 105. An allele is considered lost if, in a population, a gene is present, where all individuals are sharing the same value for that particular gene. An allele is, as defined by De Jong, considered to be a converged allele, when 95% of a population share the same value for a certain gene (see also convergence).De Jong, K.A. (1975). Analysis of the behaviour of a class of genetic adaptive systems, ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan. Strategies for preventing premature convergence Strategies to regain genetic variation can be: * a mating strategy called incest prevention, * uniform crossover, * favored replacement of similar individuals (preselection or crowding), * segmentation of individuals of similar fitness (fitness sharing), * increasing population size. The genetic variation can also be regained by mutation though this process is highly random.  Identification of the occurrence of premature convergence  It is hard to determine when premature convergence has occurred, and it is equally hard to predict its presence in the future. One measure is to use the difference between the average and maximum fitness values, as used by Patnaik & Srinivas, to then vary the crossover and mutation probabilities.Patnaik, L.M. & Srinivas, M. (1994). Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms. IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern., vol. 24, pp. 656-667. Population diversity is another measure which has been extensively used in studies to measure premature convergence. However, although it has been widely accepted that a decrease in the population diversity directly leads to premature convergence, there have been little studies done on the analysis of population diversity. In other words, by using the term population diversity, the argument for a study in preventing premature convergence lacks robustness, unless specified what their definition of population diversity is.G√ºnter, R. (2001). Self-adaptation may lead to premature convergence , Fachbereich Informatik, LS XI, Universit√§t Dortmund, pp. 1 - 13.  Causes for premature convergence  There are a number of presumed or hypothesized causes for the occurrence of premature convergence.  Self-adaptive mutations  Rechenberg introduced the idea of self-adaptation of mutation distributions in evolutionary strategies.Rechenberg, I. (1973). Evolutionsstrategie: Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution. Frommann-Holzboog Verlag, Stuttgart. According to Rechenberg, the control parameters for these mutation distributions evolved internally through self- adaptation, rather than predetermination. He called it the 1/5-success rule of evolutionary strategies (1 + 1)-ES: The step size control parameter would be increased by some factor if the relative frequency of positive mutations through a determined period of time is larger than 1/5, vice versa if it is smaller than 1/5. Self-adaptive mutations may very well be one of the causes for premature convergence. Accurately locating of optima can be enhanced by self-adaptive mutation, as well as accelerating the search for this optima. This has been widely recognized, though the mechanism's underpinnings of this have been poorly studied, as it is often unclear whether the optima is found locally or globally. Self-adaptive methods can cause global convergence to global optimum, provided that the selection methods used are using elitism, as well as that the rule of self-adaptation doesn't interfere with the mutation distribution, which has the property of ensuring a positive minimum probability when hitting a random subset.Rudolph, G. (1999). Global convergence and self-adaptation: A counter-example. In Proceedings of the 1999 Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC 1999). IEEE Press, New Jersey, pp. 646‚Äì651. This is for non-convex objective functions with sets that include bounded lower levels of non-zero measurements. A study by G√ºnter suggests that self-adaption mechanisms among elitist evolutionary strategies do resemble the 1/5-success rule, and could very well get caught by a local optimum that include a positive probability.

Career Michael Zulli's career in the comics industry began in October 1986 with The Puma Blues, on which he collaborated with writer Stephen Murphy. The monthly title was published by Dave Sim's Aardvark One International and later by Mirage Studios. Zulli illustrated the characters, wildlife and natural landscapes in the polluted post-industrial environment of the story's not-too- distant future. The ecological warnings of the series put forward an argument for natural conservation and against the abuse and pollution of the natural environment. The series was published for 23 issues and a mini-comic half issue, ending in 1989. Between 1990 and 1991, Zulli created three issues of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: #31 (Soul's Winter) #35 (Soul's Withering), and #36 (Soul's End). His dark and uniquely realistic interpretation of the TMNT entitled the \\"Soul's Trilogy\\" became polarizing among fans of the series. Zulli wrote, drew, and painted the covers for the 3 issues. The work has been viewed as a classic series in hindsight and collected by IDW as \\"Soul's Winter.\\" He drew a never-published issue of DC Comics' Swamp Thing in which the title character meets Jesus Christ. In the 1990s another unfinished and unpublished story, Sweeney Todd, written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Zulli for Stephen R. Bissette's publication Taboo was stopped when the anthology itself was discontinued. By this time, Zulli had received the attention of many writers, editors and artists in the comics industry. In 1990 he guest pencilled issue #13 of DC Comics' nascent Vertigo series The Sandman written by Gaiman. This story introduced the Hob Gadling character. Zulli would illustrate seven Sandman issues including the final Sandman story arc \\"The Wake\\". Zulli and Gaiman collaborated on a comics adaptation of Alice Cooper's The Last Temptation in 1994. After The Sandman series ended, he had a gallery show called \\"Visions of the Wake\\" in New York City. He also began illustrating for several newer Vertigo imprint titles including Winter's Edge, Witchcraft: La Terreur and Sandman Presents: Love Street. He was one of the artists on the Shade limited series which spun off from the Starman series.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 281: \\"The Shade...nabbed his first miniseries in April [1997], courtesy of writer James Robinson and artist Gene Ha, J.

Her roles included horror and comedy; she was best known as the villain Servalan in the British science fiction TV series Blake's 7. Early life Pearce was born in Woking, Surrey, in 1943. Her mother left the family when she was 16 months old and she grew up between her father's home and a foster family. She attended the Marist Convent School for Girls at West Byfleet. She trained at the British stage school Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and at Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in Los Angeles. Career= Films  Pearce starred in two Hammer horror films, The Plague of the Zombies and The Reptile, which were filmed simultaneously on the same location and both released in 1966. Other film roles include Sky West and Crooked (1965), the Carry On film Don't Lose Your Head (1966), Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River (1968), White Mischief (1987), How to Get Ahead in Advertising (1989), and Princess Caraboo (1994). TV appearances As well as appearing in the BBC children's programmes Dark Season (alongside Kate Winslet) and Moondial, Pearce appeared in the Doctor Who serial The Two Doctors as Chessene, a bloodthirsty alien. She was associated with Doctor Who through her appearance in The Fearmonger as Sherilyn Harper, an audio drama by Big Finish Productions, and as Admiral Mettna in the webcast story Death Comes to Time. Pearce returned once again to Doctor Who from 2015, this time opposite John Hurt, as a regular in the Big Finish audio series based on the adventures of the War Doctor, portraying Cardinal Ollistra, a leader of the Time Lords in the Time War who often clashes with the Eighth Doctor and the War Doctor over how far the Time Lords should be willing to go to achieve victory. She remains best known for her role as Servalan in the British science fiction TV series Blake's 7 (1978‚Äì1981). The character was originally written for one episode, but was expanded to a regular role over four series due to Pearce's popularity. She appeared in the role of Rosa Dartle in the BBC dramatisation of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield (1974) and a television version of Christopher Hampton's stage play The Philanthropist as Araminta which was first broadcast in 1975. She also appeared as an associate of the assassin Carlos in the television movie, The Bourne Identity (1988). Pearce also made guest appearances in TV series such as Danger Man, The Avengers, Public Eye, Callan, Dead of Night, Special Branch, The Zoo Gang, Spy Trap, and The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.. She appeared in two episodes of the spy series Man in a Suitcase, unusually in different roles within the same season. Pearce suffered from clinical depression during periods of her life. She was the subject of the third volume of MJTV's \\"The Actor Speaks\\" interview/drama CDs, with a special piece written for her by Tanith Lee.  Death  Pearce was diagnosed with lung cancer in August 2018 and died on 3 September 2018 at her home in Lancashire.

At the triple junction each of the three boundaries will be one of 3 types ‚Äì a ridge (R), trench (T) or transform fault (F) ‚Äì and triple junctions can be described according to the types of plate margin that meet at them (e.g. Transform-Transform-Trench, Ridge-Ridge-Ridge, or abbreviated F-F-T, R-R-R). Of the many possible types of triple junction only a few are stable through time ('stable' in this context means that the geometrical configuration of the triple junction will not change through geologic time). The meeting of 4 or more plates is also theoretically possible but junctions will only exist instantaneously. Main tectonic plate boundaries ‚Äì ridge (red), trench (green), transform (black) ‚Äì and corresponding triple junctions (yellow dots) History The first scientific paper detailing the triple junction concept was published in 1969 by Dan McKenzie and W. Jason Morgan. The term had traditionally been used for the intersection of three divergent boundaries or spreading ridges. These three divergent boundaries ideally meet at near 120¬∞ angles. In plate tectonics theory during the breakup of a continent, three divergent boundaries form, radiating out from a central point (the triple junction). One of these divergent plate boundaries fails (see aulacogen) and the other two continue spreading to form an ocean. The opening of the south Atlantic Ocean started at the south of the South American and African continents, reaching a triple junction in the present Gulf of Guinea, from where it continued to the west. The NE-trending Benue Trough is the failed arm of this junction. In the years since, the term triple-junction has come to refer to any point where three tectonic plates meet. Interpretation The properties of triple junctions are most easily understood from the purely kinematic point of view where the plates are rigid and moving over the surface of the Earth. No knowledge of the Earth's interior or the geological details of the crust are then needed. Another useful simplification is that the kinematics of triple junctions on a flat Earth are essentially the same as those on the surface of a sphere. On a sphere, plate motions are described as relative rotations about Euler Poles (see Plate reconstruction), and the relative motion at every point along a plate boundary can be calculated from this rotation. But the area around a triple junction is small enough (relative to the size of the sphere) and (usually) far enough from the pole of rotation, that the relative motion across a boundary can be assumed to be constant along that boundary. Thus, analysis of triple junctions can usually be done on a flat surface with motions defined by vectors. Stability Triple junctions may be described and their stability assessed without use of the geological details but simply by defining the properties of the ridges, trenches and transform faults involved, making some simplifying assumptions and applying simple velocity calculations. This assessment can generalise to most actual triple junction settings provided the assumptions and definitions broadly apply to the real Earth. A stable junction is one at which the geometry of the junction is retained with time as the plates involved move. This places restrictions on relative velocities and plate boundary orientation. An unstable triple junction will change with time, either to become another form of triple junction (RRF junctions easily evolve to FFR junctions), will change geometry or are simply not feasible (as in the case of FFF junctions). By assuming that plates are rigid and that the Earth is spherical, Leonhard Euler‚Äôs theorem of motion on a sphere can be used to reduce the stability assessment to determining boundaries and relative motions of the interacting plates. The rigid assumption holds very well in the case of oceanic crust, and the radius of the Earth at the equator and poles only varies by a factor of roughly one part in 300 so the Earth approximates very well to a sphere. McKenzie and MorganEvolution of Triple Junctions, McKenzie, D. P., and Morgan, W. J., Nature, 224, 125 (1969) first analysed the stability of triple junctions using these assumptions with the additional assumption that the Euler poles describing the motions of the plates were such that they approximated to straight line motion on a flat surface. This simplification applies when the Euler poles are distant from the triple junction concerned. The definitions they used for R, T and F are as follows: * R ‚Äì structures that produce lithosphere symmetrically and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the plates on either side (this does not always apply, for example in the Gulf of Aden). * T ‚Äì structures that consume lithosphere from one side only. The relative velocity vector can be oblique to the plate boundary. * F ‚Äì active faults parallel to the slip vector.  Stability criteria  For a triple junction between the plates A, B and C to exist, the following condition must be satisfied: AvB \\\\+ BvC \\\\+ CvA = 0 where AvB is the relative motion of B with respect to A. This condition can be represented in velocity space by constructing a velocity triangle ABC where the lengths AB, BC and CA are proportional to the velocities AvB, BvC and CvA respectively. Further conditions must also be met for the triple junction to exist stably ‚Äì the plates must move in a way that leaves their individual geometries unchanged. Alternatively the triple junction must move in such a way that it remains on all three of the plate boundaries involved. These criteria can be represented on the same velocity space diagrams in the following way. The lines ab, bc and ca join points in velocity space which will leave the geometry of AB, BC and CA unchanged. These lines are the same as those that join points in velocity space at which an observer could move at the given velocity and still remain on the plate boundary. When these are drawn onto the diagram containing the velocity triangle these lines must be able to meet at a single point, for the triple junction to exist stably. These lines necessarily are parallel to the plate boundaries as to remain on the plate boundaries the observer must either move along the plate boundary or remain stationary on it. * For a ridge the line constructed must be the perpendicular bisector of the relative motion vector as to remain in the middle of the ridge an observer would have to move at half the relative speeds of the plates either side but could also move in a perpendicular direction along the plate boundary. * For a transform fault the line must be parallel to the relative motion vector as all of the motion is parallel to the boundary direction and so the line ab must lie along AB for a transform fault separating the plates A and B. * For an observer to remain on a trench boundary they must walk along the strike of the trench but remaining on the overriding plate. Therefore, the line constructed will lie parallel to the plate boundary but passing through the point in velocity space occupied by the overriding plate. The point at which these lines meet, J, gives the overall motion of the triple junction with respect to the Earth. Using these criteria it can easily be shown why the FFF triple junction is not stable: the only case in which three lines lying along the sides of a triangle can meet at a point is the trivial case in which the triangle has sides lengths zero, corresponding to zero relative motion between the plates. As faults are required to be active for the purpose of this assessment, an FFF junction can never be stable. Types McKenzie and Morgan determined that there were 16 types of triple junction theoretically possible, though several of these are speculative and have not necessarily been seen on Earth. These junctions were classified firstly by the types of plate boundaries meeting ‚Äì for example RRR, TTR, RRT, FFT etc. ‚Äì and secondly by the relative motion directions of the plates involved. Some configurations such as RRR can only have one set of relative motions whereas TTT junctions may be classified into TTT(a) and TTT(b). These differences in motion direction affect the stability criteria. McKenzie and Morgan claimed that of these 14 were stable with FFF and RRF configurations unstable, however, YorkEvolution of Triple Junctions, Letters to Nature, Nature 244, 341‚Äì342 (10 August 1973) later showed that the RRF configuration could be stable under certain conditions. Ridge-Ridge-Ridge junctions Afar triangle in East Africa, an example of an RRR junction and the only triple junction on Earth that can be seen above sea level. An RRR junction is always stable using these definitions and therefore very common on Earth, though in a geological sense ridge spreading is usually discontinued in one direction leaving failed rift zone. There are many examples of these present both now and in the geological past such as the South Atlantic opening with ridges spreading North and South to form the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and an associated aulacogen in the Niger Delta region of Africa. RRR junctions are also common as rifting along three fractures at 120¬∞ is the best way to relieve stresses from uplift at the surface of a sphere; on Earth, stresses similar to these are believed to be caused by the mantle hotspots thought to initiate rifting in continents. The stability of RRR junctions is demonstrated below ‚Äì as the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle always meet at a single point, the lines ab, bc and ca can always be made to meet regardless of relative velocities. Ridge-Trench-Fault junctions RTF junctions are less common, an unstable junction of this type (an RTF(a)) is thought to have existed at roughly 12Ma at the mouth of the Gulf of California where the East Pacific Rise currently meets the San Andreas Fault zone. The Guadeloupe and Fallaron microplates were previously being subducted under the North American Plate and the northern end of this boundary met the San Andreas Fault. Material for this subduction was provided by a ridge equivalent to the modern East Pacific Rise slightly displaced to the west of the trench. As the ridge itself was subducted an RTF triple junction momentarily existed but subduction of the ridge caused the subducted lithosphere to weaken and ‚Äòtear‚Äô from the point of the triple junction. The loss of slab pull caused by the detachment of this lithosphere ended the RTF junction giving the present day ridge ‚Äì fault system. An RTF(a) is stable if ab goes through the point in velocity space C, or if ac and bc are colinear. Trench-Trench-Trench junctions A TTT(a) junction can be found in central Japan where the Eurasian plate overrides the Philippine and Pacific plates, with the Philippine plate also overriding the Pacific. Here the Japan Trench effectively branches to form the Ryukyu and Bonia arcs. The stability criteria for this type of junction are either ab and ac form a straight line or that the line bc is parallel to CA. Examples The Nootka Fault at the triple junction of the North American Plate, the Explorer Plate, and the Juan de Fuca *The junction of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the East African Rift centered in the Afar Triangle (the Afar Triple Junction) is the only Ridge- Ridge-Ridge (R-R-R) triple junction above sea level. *The Rodrigues Triple Junction is a R-R-R triple junction in the southern Indian Ocean, where the African, the Indo-Australian and the Antarctic Plates meet. *The Galapagos Triple Junction is an R-R-R triple junction where the Nazca, the Cocos, and the Pacific Plates meet. The East Pacific Rise extends north and south from this junction and the Galapagos Rise goes to the east. This example is made more complex by the Galapagos Microplate which is a small separate plate on the rise just to the southeast of the triple junction. *Chiapas coast off Tapachula where Guatemala, North America and Pacific join and small earthquakes occur weekly. This is pushed eastward by the Cocos plate. *On the west coast of North America is another unstable triple junction offshore of Cape Mendocino. To the south, the San Andreas Fault, a strike-slip fault and transform plate boundary, separates the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. To the north lies the Cascadia subduction zone, where a section of the Juan de Fuca Plate called the Gorda Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate, forming a trench (T). Another transform fault, the Mendocino Fault (F), runs along the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Gorda Plate. Where the three intersect is the seismically active, F-F-T Mendocino Triple Junction. *The Amurian Plate, the Okhotsk Plate, and the Philippine Sea Plate meet in Japan near Mount Fuji. (see Mount Fuji's Geology) *The Azores Triple Junction is a geologic triple junction where the boundaries of three tectonic plates intersect: the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, R-R-R. *The Boso Triple Junction offshore Japan is a T-T-T triple junction between the Okhotsk Plate, Pacific Plate and Philippine Sea Plate. *The North Sea is located at the extinct triple junction of three former continental plates of the Palaeozoic era: Avalonia, Laurentia and Baltica. *The South Greenland Triple Junction was an R-R-R triple junction where the Eurasian, Greenland and North American plates diverged during the Paleogene.

The Three Mascaritas Characters are only listed once, normally under the first applicable subsection in the list. They are listed in order of their first appearance * ' ‚Äì Rikochet is an ambitious 10-year-old student at the school of Lucha Libre who strives to be the greatest luchador of all time (aka Luchador Supreme). His signature moves include the \\"Pulverizing Pinball\\", in which he turns into a giant pinball following a brief and melodramatic routine, and the \\"Spinning Top\\" in which he transforms into a giant spinning top. His greatest role model is \\"El Rey\\", and his father is a famous wrestler called \\"Lone Star\\". His catchphrase is \\"Ay, basura\\" (which literally means \\"Oh, garbage\\" in Spanish) whenever he finds himself in a bad situation. He was voiced by Carlos Alazraqui in the first two seasons and Jason Marsden in the third season. * ' ‚Äì Buena Girl is a 10-year-old and the most knowledgeable among The Three Mascaritas. She lives by every rule of The Code of Masked Wrestling, which she uses as guidelines for the Mascaritas' actions and behavior. She has a by the book personality, which often causes friction between her and her friends. Her signature move is the \\"Buena Bulldozer Of Truth\\", where she literally transforms into a bulldozer. It is hinted that she has a crush on Rikochet. She is often shown to be a descendant of the Slamazons, an ancient tribe of female masked wrestlers (Play on the Amazons). Normally, Buena Girl remarks, \\"It's not right!\\" when something goes against the Code of Masked Wrestling or anything outside the rules. She also alternates the Spanish buena in place of its English counterpart, good in some sentences. Her parents \\"Buena Mom\\" and \\"Buena Dad\\" are very cheery. She was voiced by Kimberly Brooks. * ' ‚Äì The Flea is the 8-year-old filthy boy. He has a certain disregard for personal hygiene and usually has no problem with breaking the rules, unlike his friends. He also almost always refers to himself in the third person (though he has occasionally said \\"I\\", \\"me\\", \\"mine\\", or \\"my\\" at times). The Flea's signature move is the \\"Trashcan of Terror\\", in which he turns into a trashcan. Most of his moves involve flatulence or are dirt-themed. It was revealed in three episodes that The Flea's costume is actually white, but it has turned brown because he never cleans it and prefers it unclean. If he is to eat something \\"pure and clean\\" he is transformed into his own opposite, Bueno flea. He is shown to be no match for his little sister Pulgita but she still has a close bond with The Flea. He is normally the cause or victim of some of the strangest and supernatural events such as \\"The evil masked toilet\\" and his unwashed hands causing an invasion of evil donuts. He is often mistaken for a very weak student, but if The Flea is actually brave enough, he is able to rival Rikochet. His teeth are sometimes rendered as donkey teeth. Sometimes when the Flea is in trouble or is being knocked a far distance he normally yells \\"zapatos de rata\\" which literally means \\"shoes of rat\\" or \\"rat shoes\\". His parents run the \\"Slammin' Donuts\\" donut shop. He is voiced by Candi Milo. Other students * Megawatt ‚Äì A wrestler whose mask resembles a lightbulb, and he can execute electric attacks. He is shown to be very clumsy. It is often implied he and Electricity have some kind of relationship. His signature move is Magna Electrica. He has a pet electrical eel after befriending it in \\"The Flea's Fighting Fish.\\" He is voiced by Michael Donovan. * Penny Plutonium ‚Äì Penny is the show's resident girly genius who often conducts science experiments that usually backfire. She has a secret crush on Rikochet. She is accident-prone, and always gets others into predicaments. Her signature moves often enlargen her brain. She is voiced by Tabitha St. Germain. * Potato Patata Jr. ‚Äì A potato-themed masked wrestler. He is one of the heavyweight wrestlers. He also talks in ghetto slang. He is the son of Potato Potata Sr. His signature moves include \\"Spudnick\\" where he leaps up, becomes a potato/satellite and falls on his opponent and \\"1 Potato, 2 Potato, 3 Potato, 4\\". His main opponent is Rikochet. He often bullies Rikochet. He is voiced by Cusse Mankuma. * Francisco of the Forest ‚Äì A jaguar-themed masked wrestler. Like Potato Potata Jr. he is also a heavyweight classed wrestler, but his weight comes more from his muscular build than girth. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. * El Haystack Grande ‚Äì A haystack-costumed wrestler with farm-based moves and speaks in a country accent. His name is taken from the famous British wrestler, Giant Haystacks. His signature move is the \\"Combine Harvester\\" where he jumps up and becomes a combine harvester to beat his opponents. He is voiced by Garry Chalk. * Double Ninja Ninja ‚Äì A Japanese ninja-themed masked wrestler. He seems to get carried away when performing a simple task such as opening a door. His signature move is the \\"Double Ninja Ju-jitsu\\", where he clones himself. Voiced by Brian Drummond. * Sonic Sumo ‚Äì A masked sumo wrestler with high tech gear. His signature move is the \\"Sonic Freeze\\" which caused Rikochet to be stuck in his pinball form in \\"Pinball Wizard\\". He is voiced by Brian Drummond. * Minotoro ‚Äì A minotaur-themed wrestler who is kind despite him being rich. His mom spoils him with everything he wants and Rikochet faintly envies him. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. * El Perrito ‚Äì A dog-themed wrestler whose name is Spanish for \\"the Puppy\\" or \\"the Doggy\\". He's an allusion to a famous Mexican wrestler named Perro Aguayo. He is voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. * Snow Pea ‚Äì The small, babylike pea pod-themed wrestler Snow Pea is the least violent student in the school. He can only say his own name, with the exception of the word \\"Rutavega\\", the name of his online alias. Snow Pea's costume resembles a peapod, with a zipper that he uses to hide himself. He is the victim of the bad events due to his gentle nature. He is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. * La Flamencita ‚Äì A Spanish flamenco dancer who communicates by clacking her castanets and tapping her feet. Buena Girl was the only member of the masked trio who could understand her until Rikochet learned how to flamenco dance. She is a practitioner of Lucha Dancing, which, as its name implies, seems to be a combination of dancing and Lucha Libre. Her tag team Lucha Dance partner is Botas del Fuego. She is not voiced. * French Twist ‚Äì A French mime-themed masked wrestler and is mainly a non-speaking character. He only spoke in the episode \\"French Twisted\\", but he quickly abandoned it because it hindered his progress. His powers involve turning imaginary objects he acts out, into real invisible objects. He is voiced by Lee Tockar. * Cindy Slam ‚Äì A violent masked wrestler who hates just about everything and can get angry very easily. Most of her appearances in the first two seasons had her growling most of the time with little speech, but in season 3, she started talking regularly more often with a southern accent. Her signature move is the \\"Cindy Slammer\\" in which she turns her hands into brick walls to crush her opponents. Her first voice is done by Kimberly Brooks and her second is done by Candi Milo. * Zero Kelvin ‚Äì An ice-element wrestler who dresses in a big light blue afro, blue pants, and white vest. He lives in an igloo and his moves are ice-themed. He is friends with Pierre Del Fuego but there is often conflict between them. In the episode \\"How Rikochet Got His Move Back\\" his signature move is revealed to be transforming into an ice block. He is voiced by Cusse Mankuma. * Pierre Del Fuego ‚Äì A fire-element wrestler with fire-like red hair who is constantly clashing with Zero Kelvin but they're actually friends. His moves are heat and fire-themed. His name is French and Spanish for \\"Stone of Fire\\". He is voiced by Brent Pachman. * Protozoa ‚Äì A single-cell based wrestler who is talented at evaporation. His signature move \\"Protoplasm\\" transforms him into a single-eyed ameoba. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. * Private Reinhardt ‚Äì A gas masked wrestler whose name is a play on the name \\"Private Ryan\\" and the expression \\"iron heart\\". Voiced by Rob Paulsen. * El Oscuro Invasor ‚Äì A wrestler whose costume is similar to that of Darth Vader. His character was never really developed and was never seen outside of season one. His name is Spanish for \\"The Dark Invader\\". * Tibor the Terrible ‚Äì A pirate-themed wrestler with an eye patch. He seems to want to be a real pirate. He is voiced by Carlos Alazraqui then Dee Bradley Baker. * El Gundamo ‚Äì His character is inspired by Japanese wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger. He aims to be the monster warden of Little Tokyo, and takes lessons from Kyoto (a sensei who resembles a pink bunny). He seems to have a fascination with robots. He tricked The three Mascaritas into thinking that he could slay giant monsters in Japan but in truth, he was a coward. El Gundamo's finisher is \\"Tsunami Slam\\" where he turns into a giant tsunami the same colors as his costume and rams himself into the opponent. His name is a parody of the Japanese anime series Mobile Suit Gundam. In season one, his mask had shades over his eyes (similar to Penny Plutonium) but in Season 2 and onwards he had visible eye holes in place. He is voiced by Lee Tockar. * Coco Demento ‚Äì A clown-based wrestler who is clearly a parody of Doink the Clown has been revealed to be the son of a ringmaster. He only seems to satisfy his audiences when performing funny stuff. In \\"Fears of a Clown\\" it was revealed that he once hung out with a group of mischief-making clowns (which would probably explain why he was in the bad guys' class) but left after being disgusted with their ways. He never speaks and prefers to honk with his red nose. * La Pi√±ata ‚Äì A pi√±ata-themed wrestler whose costume covers almost her entire body, leaving only her eyes uncovered. Aptly, when she is beaten in a match, candy falls around her and she awards her opponents a prize. An example was when she gave Rikochet a mariachi band after being defeated in the episode \\"The Musica Man\\". Her family has a tradition of making pi√±atas. She is voiced by Kathleen Barr. * Ensalada De Frutas ‚Äì A fruit-themed masked wrestler with a pineapple mask. He often works as a locutor. His name literally means \\"fruit salad\\" in Spanish. Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. * El Loco Mosquito ‚Äì A short, mosquito-themed wrestler with a high-pitched and who is one of a few insect-classed wrestlers. He is voiced by Lee Tockar. * Dragonfly ‚Äì A tall, Afro-Cuban dragonfly-like wrestler whose eyes are never shown, and is one of a few insect-classed wrestlers. She is voiced by Janyse Jaud. * Skelantonio ‚Äì A skeleton-like wrestler who used bone-themed signature moves. Ironically, he beat the Flea but was beaten by the Flea's little sister, Pulgita. Voiced by Scott McNeil. * Tic-Tac-Toe ‚Äì A wrestler whose moves are based on the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Voiced by Cusse Mankuma. * El Pacifico ‚Äì A character with a stick and peace symbol. In Spanish, \\"pacifico\\" is an adjective meaning \\"peaceful\\". Voiced by Miguel Sandoval. * Timmy of 1,000 Masks ‚Äì First appeared in a self-titled episode, he has the ability to wear the masks of other luchadores and impersonate them (although he can't imitate their signature moves). There, he used this ability to cause crimes that were then pinned others but the three Mascaritas, the Headmistress caught him and he was expelled. However, he made a returning appearance in \\"The Match Before Christmas\\". His character is based on Mexican wrestler Mil Mascaras. He is voiced by Carlos Alazraqui and later by Matt Hill. * Electricity ‚Äì A wrestler who is Megawatt's girlfriend. She was first seen in \\"Party Animal\\", but didn't have any real character development until \\"The Collector\\". She often electrocutes herself from combing her hair repeatedly. She is voiced by Candi Milo. Family, pets, and paraphernalia * Mr. & Mrs. Flea ‚Äì The Flea's parents. They run the \\"Slammin' Donuts\\" store. They also always refer to themselves in the third person like the Flea. They are voiced by Colin Murdock and Kathleen Barr. * Pulgita ‚Äì The Flea's baby sister. She seems to be stronger than the Flea himself, although the Flea is never conscious when this is displayed. Her name means \\"Little Flea\\". Voiced by Candi Milo. * Chinche ‚Äì The Flea's cousin who wanted revenge on the Flea by stealing Rikochet and Buena Girl for revealing when he was young that he used diapers but eventually forgave him when the Flea apologized in his self-titled episode. His name is Spanish for \\"bedbug.\\" Voiced by Nicole Oliver. * Buena Dad and Buena Mom ‚Äì Buena Girl's parents. They are both excessively cheery and shamelessly tout images of perfection. They are voiced by Brian Drummond and Kathleen Barr. * Lonestar and Mama Maniaca ‚Äì Rikochet's parents. They first met when Rikochet's mother lost her Lucha Libre 4 Ever necklace and she bumped into him while trying to find it. Lonestar is a popular professional wrestler and one of his son's 3 idols next to El Rey and Blue Demon Jr. Lonestar is never seen at home due to his constant touring, although his relationship with his family remains strong. Lonestar's moves are based on stars, while Mama's moves are based on household things. Voiced by Benito Martinez and Candi Milo. * Abuelito ‚Äì Rikochet's grandfather. When he was a wrestler, he was called Estrella del Fuego (Star of Fire). He uses dentures because when he was younger he lost his teeth after fighting a mini-market wrestler and stealing his mask. He is voiced by Terry Klassen. * Masked Dog ‚Äì Rikochet's dog, who also wears a mask like most of the characters in the series. He seems to have a mind of his own, also seems to be immensely popular even among enemies as they pound their fists with him and say, \\"He's Cool\\". Not voiced. Originally he was The Flea's pet dog. * El Rey ‚Äì An action figure who talks, has a life of his own and lives in Rikochet's backpack. He has the personality of a drill sergeant, harshly reprimanding Rikochet whenever he makes a mistake with his catch phrase, \\"YOU'RE A DISGRACE!\\", but he does not always behave honorably himself. He always calls Rikochet \\"Chico\\". There is also an actual (fictitious) wrestler named El Rey whom the Three Mascaritas are huge fans of, and whom the action figure is based on. The real El Rey is most likely an amalgam modeled after real-life luchador El Santo and Sgt. Slaughter due to his \\"action figure\\" status and because he also starred in many old movies. He is voiced by Michael Donovan. * The Dipper Bros. ‚Äì Ricochet's inept paternal uncles \\"Big\\" and \\"Little\\". They are the world's foremost tag team and are the only members of Rikochet's family who do not wear masks, instead wearing numbered tights. They have a bad habit of breaking everything in the house whenever they visit to the point where Mama Maniaca refuses to allow them inside. Their motto and catchphrase is \\"Don't worry, we'll fix it!\\" as they try to clean up their messes which normally also causes problems in another room. They inadvertently caused Lonestar and Mama Maniaca to meet when they bumped into Mama Maniaca causing her to lose her beloved necklace, causing their brother to help look for it and eventually leading them to each other. \\"Big\\" is voiced by John DiMaggio, while \\"Little\\" is voiced by Phil LaMarr. Other family members * Big Dog ‚Äì El Perrito's father. * El Cientifico ‚Äì Penny Plutonium's father. His Wife is never seen or mentioned in the series. Voiced by Colin Murdock. * Potato Potata Sr. ‚Äì Potato Patata, Jr.'s father. * Tomato Tomata ‚Äì Potato Patata, Jr.'s sister, a foil to Penny. Faculty * Headmistress ‚Äì The principal of the school of lucha libre that the Mascaritas attend. Headmistress is extremely strict and intolerant of any behavior that goes against the code of masked wrestling, often expelling students at the slightest infraction. Her mask resembles a giant brain. When she was unmasked in \\"Field of Screams\\", Headmistress has long brown hair. While traveling back in time in \\"Woulda, Coulda, Hasbeena\\", Buena Girl meets who appears to be a younger Headmistress. She is voiced by Candi Milo. * Se√±or Hasbeena ‚Äì A nostalgic 1970s loving teacher who has much nostalgia for the 1970s, resembling a disco nut. He was named \\"Se√±or Couldbea\\". A former professional wrestler, he lost his World Championship title in 1972 and never won it again, an incident that has haunted him for years. When Rikochet accidentally opens a time portal to the day of that fight in \\"Woulda, Coulda, Hasbeena\\", Se√±or Hasbeena tried to prevent the incident that resulted in his defeat, only to find out it was himself traveling in time to prevent his loss that ruined his fight in the first place. His name is derived from the term \\"has-been\\". His signature move is the \\"Funkay DiscoBall\\". He is voiced by Scott McNeil. * Mr. Midcarda ‚Äì The physical education teacher who organizes lucha libre matches between students and acts as the referee. His name is derived from the professional wrestling term \\"midcarder\\", which refers to a wrestler who performs between the undercard and the main event. He was voiced by Carlos Alazraqui and later voiced by Jason Marsden. * El Dolor De Kurtz ‚Äì The evil teacher of the \\"Bad Guy\\" class from Room 207. His character is based on Colonel Walter E. Kurtz from the novel Heart of Darkness and its film adaptation Apocalypse Now.

Hairy Knuckles Wrestling Academy The Hairy Knuckles Wrestling Academy is technically the opposite of the Foremost World Renowned International School of Lucha. They consisted of unmasked wrestlers and do not abide by the \\"Code of Masked Wrestling\\". The most known students are the three known as Prima Donna Hodges, Carlton Cold Jones, and Heavy Traffic. * Prima Donna Hodges ‚Äì The masculine-voiced leader of the group. She seems to be very muscular and aggressive. She also sounds much like a tough man. She's 13 years old. She often refers to the Mascaritas as \\"jabronis\\", a play on the term \\"jobber\\", which was coined by The Iron Sheik and later popularized by The Rock. Voiced by Kathleen Barr. * Carlton Cold Jones ‚Äì He seems to be the brainless one of the group. In one episode, he faced off with Rikochet and tried to get a better arriving theme than him. Voiced by Lee Tockar. * Heavy Traffic ‚Äì He seems to be the aggressive one known to tear everything apart. At one point Buena Girl refined him.

Voiced by Brian Drummond. * Ham Hands ‚Äì He seems to be the extra one of the group, he wears face paint. He is also the \\"worst wrestler in the Hairy Knuckles Wrestling Academy\\". Voiced by Janyse Jaud. One-shot characters * Misterioso Grande ‚Äì An evil wrestler from the dream world. Legend has it that if he defeats you and steals your mask in the dream world, it is gone forever in the real world, unless Misterioso Grande is defeated. In his debut episode he steals Penny Plutonium's mask resulting in her making a makeshift mask and missing several days of school until Rikochet defeats him. He disappears seemingly never to be seen again. He returns for his revenge in \\"Field of Screams\\" where he escapes the dream world and steals nearly everyone at the school of lucha's masks. Rikochet, the Flea, and Buena Girl team up and once again defeat him this time for good. Misterioso Grande has immense powers in both worlds, a nod to Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street series. Also at the end of the debut episode Penny's dog wore Misterioso Grande's mask implicating that Penny's dog is Misterioso Grande-or else that the dog just wanted to scare the Flea. Voiced by Carlos Alazraqui, and Dee Bradley Baker. * Los Lobos de Lucha ‚Äì They are the wrestling alter-egos of the band Los Lobos and voiced by the bandmembers themselves. * Rick O'Sh√¶ ‚Äì A leprechaun wrestler who resembles Rikochet. He cheats to win all of his matches, which is considered an honor amongst leprechauns. He became upset with Rikochet because Rikochet fought righteously to win his matches, which made Rick O'Sh√¶ a laughing stock among his peers. He sabotaged one of Rikochet's matches by tying his opponent's shoelaces together, and getting him blamed for hitting Mr. Midcarda with a mallet. He then confronted Rikochet on the street, which made everybody believe he was crazy, causing him to be committed to the \\"funny farm\\". Rick then brought Rikochet to leprechaun land and challenged him to a fight, which was broadcast to everybody who thought Rikochet was crazy. Rick O'Sh√¶ used multiple cheating methods to try to beat Rikochet, trying to get him to cheat as well. Rikochet eventually found out that fighting fair actually drives Rick O'Sh√¶ insane, and used that to that advantage. Rick O'Sh√¶ used multiple cheating tactics on him, that backfired. At the end, Rikochet tricked Rick into giving him the source of his power, and use it in a vending machine. Rikochet then beat Rikochet, earned the right to his name, and cleared it because the fight was broadcast to the whole world. Rick O'Sh√¶ uses two unlucky charms, a gold coin with a four-leaf clover on it, and a gold coin with an upside-down horseshoe on it, to gain the cheating abilities he uses to win fights. Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. * El Malefico ‚Äì El Malefico is the titular main antagonist of the movie Mucha Lucha: The Return of El Malefico. An evil thousand year-old luchador who had been sealed up for 70,000 years. He escaped in \\"The Return of El Malefico\\" when the planets align and he controls The Flea into tricking Rikochet into reading a sentence from the Code Of Masked Wrestling backwards, thus freeing him. He then set out to defeat nearly every luchador and sealing them in the Code Of Masked Wrestling thus increasing his power. Rikochet, Buena Girl, and The Flea retrieve the Artifacts Of Buenaness: the Boots of Bravery, the Cape of Courage, and the Tights of Tightness. Using these they beat El Malfico. He then used the Code Of Masked Wrestling to grow to giant size. The Three Mascaritas do the same and defeat him in an epic battle that destroyed most of the city they fought in. He was defeated when Rikochet reversed one of El Malefico's attacks. He was banished back to where he came from. El Malefico is one of the most powerful villains in Mucha Lucha, if not the most powerful. His only real weakness is that he can be vanished back but this can only happen if he is defeated which can only happen if one uses the Artifacts of Buenaness and the planets have not come out of alignment after which he becomes unstoppable. His true identity is Jenny Perkins. He also has a minion called Slurf. Voiced by Tim Curry. * Calavera Muerto ‚Äì A skeleton who appeared on El D√≠a de los Muertos, and wrestled Rikochet. He used Rikochet-pinata kinds of moves. He was unbeatable until Buena Girl and the Flea put food into the game. He made a second appearance in a later episode, where he helps Rikochet and Buena Girl rescue Flea from De Muerto. His name is Spanish for \\"dead skull\\". Voiced by Danny Cooksey. * Rey Dinamico ‚Äì A celebrity luchador that resembles WWE wrestler, Rey Mysterio who appeared in \\"Party Animal\\" taking on a Clown-like luchador opponent. At least two episodes have hinted that Buena Girl has a crush on him. His signature move involves him launching himself off the ropes like a slingshot, similar to Rey Mysterio's \\"619\\" and was described by the heroes as \\"the most devastating move in masked wrestling.\\" Voiced by Benito Martinez. * Futbol Loco ‚Äì An evil 6-year-old Brazilian soccer player who first and only appeared in \\"Thrills And Skills\\".

They appeared in The Musica Man and have made minor cameos later in the series such as in the episode \\"Kid Wombat.\\" While he initially appreciates their presence, their songs annoy everyone and tend to get Rikochet in trouble. They are finally forced to leave Rikochet alone after he, Buena Girl, and the Flea defeat them in a wrestling match. They are voiced by Los Mariachi. * Kid Wombat Jr. ‚Äì A champion of the Luchador tournament many years earlier he fought and lost to the Flea's father in the tournament. Years later in his 40s, having not changed in appearance since then, he posed as his own son to gain his title back from Rikochet. He defeated all of the other students in the tournament until only Ricochet remained and he was losing to him. After doing some research on him they found out his true identity and the Flea's father recognized him because of his pot belly and facial hair. After gaining his confidence back Rikochet was able to defeat him and he was kicked out of the school. He was voiced by James Arnold Taylor. * Rollerita ‚Äì is a Roller Lucha wrestler who was mistaken for Buena Girl.

S. Forester. Although it may be considered as the first episode in the Hornblower saga, it was written as a prequel; the first Hornblower novel, The Happy Return (\\"Beat to Quarters\\" in the U.S.), was published in 1937. Plot introduction Horatio Hornblower commences his career in the Royal Navy as an inexperienced midshipman in January 1794. Through a series of challenges and adventures both in and out of combat, Hornblower discovers he is actually talented in both seamanship and leadership. People initially thought Hornblower a dullard but later grew to respect him. Plot summary  This novel is episodic, with named chapters (that begin with Hornblower) that often focus on a self-contained incident. Hornblower and the Even Chance In this story, a gawky and seasick Hornblower comes aboard his first ship. He immediately earns the contempt of the other midshipmen. The young Hornblower is particularly despised by a midshipman named Simpson. Simpson, at age thirty-three, had failed his examination for lieutenant too many times to ever expect promotion. He takes out his bitterness and disappointment on his juniors. Hornblower is extremely unhappy. He takes the first opportunity for a way out, one way or another, by challenging Simpson to a duel. Hornblower insists on having one of the two pistols loaded and the other not, and to exchange shots at point-blank range, with neither Hornblower nor Simpson knowing which is which. The captain secretly frustrates this by having the officers of the duel load neither weapon and claiming a misfire when neither discharges. The captain later has him transferred to the frigate HMS Indefatigable. Hornblower and the Cargo of Rice In The Cargo of Rice, aboard Indefatigable, the newly situated Midshipman Hornblower is put in command of the French ship Marie Galante, carrying a cargo of rice from New Orleans, by order of Captain Pellew after it is taken as a prize. It is Hornblower's first time in command of a ship since joining the Royal Navy. He is instructed to take the captured French ship and her crew to a British port where he is to receive his next orders. Sailing is relatively smooth for Hornblower and his four seamen, until one of the crew (Matthews) informs him that the ship is taking on water from somewhere. Hornblower recalls that Marie Galante was struck below the hull's waterline by a cannonball from Indefatigable before her capture. They check for moisture but find none until it is pointed out that the dried rice will absorb all of it. They hastily attempt to patch the hole with a sail, but by then the rice has expanded so much that the ship is breaking apart. A massive attempt to jettison the rice comes too late and Hornblower commands all hands to abandon ship. Hornblower's crew and the French prisoners are left at sea in an open boat. Hornblower and the Penalty of Failure In The Penalty of Failure, Hornblower and his crew are still out at sea, between British and French ports. The captain of the recently sunk Marie Galante pleads with Hornblower to navigate to France and release him and his men, and promises safe passage for Hornblower and his crew. Hornblower promptly rejects the Captain's pleading in spite of their bleak situation and uses his pistols to prevent a mutiny. Not long afterwards, Hornblower and his crew are caught by a privateer named Pique which was converted from a slave ship. This ship is commanded by Captain Neuville. Hornblower is now a prisoner of war, but Indefatigable falls in with them and makes chase. As Pique is the faster sailer, Hornblower devises a plan to slow her down: he sets a fire, which soon spreads to the very flammable paint locker. All hands are diverted to fighting the fire, which soon breaks out on the deck and spreads to the rigging, immediately slowing the vessel. The British ship ultimately overpowers Pique, extinguishes the fire and Captain Neuville and his crew surrender. Hornblower's fears of reprimand for losing Marie Galante are quickly extinguished by the offhanded dismissal of the incident by Captain Pellew. However, instead of taking credit for the fire, Hornblower suggests that there may have been a spontaneous combustion in the paint locker, as way of punishing himself for losing Marie Galante in the first place. Hornblower and the Man Who Felt Queer Upon returning to Indefatigable, Hornblower is assigned a role of loosening the sail by Captain Pellew in his plan to take the French corvette Papillon. Hornblower is set to command Indefatigable's jolly boat. Before setting out, Hornblower practises his task on Indefatigable to try and calm his nerves. While reviewing his men prior to shoving off, a man named Hales says to Hornblower that he feels queer. After the boat crews depart, Hales begins having a seizure. Because silence was essential and was the only thing keeping the men alive, Hornblower strikes Hales and inevitably kills him. On boarding the ship Hornblower and his men are frustrated by the absence of a footrope along the yardarm. Hornblower's fear of heights terrifies him, but tries to assure himself that he was courageous in his situation with Hales. Motivated by this act of emotional self-flagellation Hornblower runs unaided along the yardarm and looses the topsail. During the fighting the jolly boat is lost, with Hales still aboard, but Papillon is taken as a prize of Indefatigable. Hornblower feels bad about the loss of Hales, without whom Hornblower believes he would never have found the courage to complete his task. Jackson claims that Hales would have never made a decent seaman anyway. Given the success of their mission Hornblower realises the loss of the jolly boat will not be held against him, but still regrets the inevitable death of Hales. Hornblower and the Man Who Saw God When Styles, a man in Hornblower's division, appears strangely marked with \\"boils\\" all over his face, Hornblower is suspicious. He gains a clue from Finch, another of his men, who suffers from delusions and claims that \\"God's in the maintop, but the Devil's in the cable tier, but only in the dog watches\\". After thinking about what this means, Hornblower investigates the cable-tier in the dog-watch and discovers a group of men \\"rat fighting\\". Styles without use of his hands has to kill rats with his teeth, while the others bet. A horrified Hornblower orders them up on deck and threatens to report them. Later, in action against a French ship, Hornblower and Finch are firing a swivel gun from the mizzen-top when the mast is hit and begins to fall. Hornblower persuades Finch to jump to safety by telling him to \\"get to God\\". The two men make a desperate jump to safety. Hornblower the Frogs, and the Lobsters  Hornblower takes part in attempted invasion of France by British and French Royalist forces at Quiberon in order to support the failed Revolt in the Vend√©e. Hornblower is ordered ashore with his seamen acting as gunners, and gains his first experience of land warfare and the horrors of the Revolution, including the guillotine. The expedition ends in failure and Hornblower escapes back to his ship, saddened, but philosophical. The Frogs are the French and the Lobsters are the (red- coated) British regiment landed to support them. Hornblower and the Spanish Galleys Hornblower's ship, Indefatigable, is in C√°diz when Spain makes peace with France. Since Spain becomes officially neutral, the British ship of war is forced to leave, passing prisoner-rowed galleys still maintained by the conservative Spanish navy. Spain has completed its political turnaround and joined France in an alliance by the time Indefatigable is escorting another ship through the Straits of Gibraltar. When there is a lack of wind and the ships are becalmed, two Spanish galleys ambush them. The galleys are fought off and Hornblower, in command of the jolly boat, helps capture one of them, which gains him promotion to Acting-Lieutenant. Hornblower subsequently attributes the \\"fighting madness\\" with which he and his sailors attack the Spanish to an irrational hatred of the galleys. Hornblower and the Examination for Lieutenant After Indefatigable comes into port at Gibraltar, Acting-Lieutenant Hornblower reports to Santa Barbara where he and others are to take their examination for lieutenant. When asked a question by one of the captains conducting the examination, Hornblower freezes up and is about fail when an alarm of cannon fire interrupts the examination; fire ships have been sent by the enemy in an attempt to destroy the British ships at Gibraltar. Hornblower and Captain Foster, one of the examining captains, take heroic action and prevent a disaster for the British, and jump in the water. They are rescued by the crew of one the fire ships, themselves escaping in a small boat, but then a British guard boat captures them in return. Since the Spanish crew saved his and Hornblower's life, Foster orders that they be released. The examining board does not reassemble since Foster falls out with another examining captain, who had been standing by with a boat but failed to reach them before the Spanish crew. Hornblower will need to wait for a later examining board. The chapter ends with Foster, impressed by Hornblower's actions, telling Hornblower that, since the attack prevented him from failing the examination, he should \\"Be thankful for small mercies. And even more thankful for big ones.\\" Hornblower and Noah's Ark Acting-Lieutenant Hornblower accompanies the diplomat Mr. Tapling to buy cattle and grain from the Bey of Oran to resupply the fleet. However, an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the city forces Hornblower, Tapling and his boat-crew to take refuge aboard the transport ship Caroline and remain in quarantine for three weeks until they are clear of infection. Hornblower struggles with a tiny crew aboard a worn-out ship, but still manages to take a prize in the shape of an unsuspecting privateer lugger, and deliver the supply ship to the fleet's base at Gibraltar. There he is reprimanded by the Victualling Officer for having allowed his crew to feast on fresh beef over the last three weeks. Hornblower the Duchess, and the Devil Hornblower is given command of the French prize Le Reve and ordered to return to England with dispatches and, to his astonishment, a passenger ‚Äì the Duchess of Wharfedale. Unfortunately, in thick fog Hornblower sails his ship directly into the middle of a Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent. Anticipating capture Hornblower prepares to throw his dispatches overboard, but is persuaded by the Duchess, who also reveals her true identity as a popular actress, to allow her to conceal them under her clothes, as she is sure to be repatriated immediately. This he does, and much later while in a Spanish prison at Ferrol receives a letter from her detailing her successful return to England, and another from the Admiralty confirming his promotion to Lieutenant. Later, while on parole Hornblower rescues some sailors from a Spanish ship wrecked on the cliffs below him. After the rescue he and his assistants, some Spanish fishermen, are forced out to sea by bad weather and found by another British frigate. Despite the temptations of staying on board, Hornblower reminds the Captain that he is released on parole and is returned to Spain under a flag of truce. Several months later, in recognition of his bravery, the Spanish authorities release him, \\"I am to restore you under flag of truce to your fellow countrymen, in recognition of ‚Äì 'your courage and self-sacrifice in saving life at the peril of your own.'\\" Characters=HMS Justinian * Captain Keene ‚Äì Commander of Justinian.

Isfahani carpets are renowned for their high quality. The most famous workshop in Isfahan is Seirafian. In Europe they became incorrectly known as Polish rugs (a la polonaise) because of the trade route from Persia to France running through Poland. Isfahan Isfahan rugs are knotted on either silk or cotton foundations, with up to 1.000.000 Persian knots/sqm(there have been pieces created by Seirafian master workshop with higher knot count), using exceptionally good quality (referred to as kork wool in Iran) wool for the pile, which is normally clipped quite low. In the beginning of the renewal of Isfahan as the carpet center of high quality rugs, most rugs used traditional motifs inspired by the architectural motifs and tiles that decorated the historical buildings of this great city. Designers were further inspired by the poets of Persia (Rumi, Hafez, Attar), nature, and religious spiritual intimations that are deeply ingrained in the culture. In contemporary items the palette has become more pastel, utilizing the technical perfection and artistic flair of this \\"City of Art\\". Both Classical and contemporary Isfahan‚Äôs are extremely attractive, and the subduing of the palette, particularly the elimination of strong reds, makes them more compatible with Western decorative schemes. A range of traditional designs are still used including allover Shah Abbas, Vase, Tree of Life and Pictorial schemes but by far the most popular composition is based on a circular central medallion (Derived from the famous mosque of Shah Lutf Allah in Isfahan) set against an elegantly sculpted field decorated with intricately purling vine palmette and flor motifs. Antique/ semi-Antique rugs of Isfahan are more colorful and richer in tone than that of Nain, a nearby city renowned for its exceptional handmade rugs. Antique Isfahans are quite sought after since production had been almost completely been halted since 1722, during which the Afghan invasion occurred. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that it was firmly reestablished. Shah Abbas the Great was an inspired King of the Safavid dynasty, and in consequence not only moved the capital of Persia to Isfahan from Qazvin but also started an artistic renaissance within the capital of his court. Under his vision and guidance carpet weaving in Isfahan flourished. However the Afghan invasion dealt a serious blow to this industry which it never recovered from until the beginning of the 20th century. Some early pieces created in the last century can be found which consist of 500.000 knots-1.000.000 knots/m2, however these are rare and few in number. World war I brought a change in ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Isfahan which was the center of weaving for the fashion industry of Iran. The change of fashion in the world also influenced Iran, causing Isfahan to lose its lucrative fabric industry. However, the shrewd businessman of Isfahan decided to utilize the fine quality wool in fabrics and aba‚Äôs (woollen cloaks) into high quality Persian rugs which again reestablished Isfahan as a base for one of the finest and most beautiful carpets of Iran. Some Isfahani rugs became known in Western Europe as \\"Polish rugs\\" or \\"Polonaise rugs\\". This name refers to carpets woven with silk, golden and silver threads in Persia during the 16th-18th centuries and exported to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They were commissioned by wealthy Polish noblemen and decorated with their coats of arms. Some of them were later resold to West European buyers who were often convinced of their Polish origin, hence their name.

It has a height of above sea level. Ulriken has an aerial tramway, Ulriksbanen, that can bring people to the top. At the top there is a TV tower, a restaurant, and free telescopes. There is a network of trails along Ulriken, which is a popular hike with several paths up ranging from steep to not so steep.  History  One of the slopes of Ulriken, known as Isdalen (\\"Ice Valley\\"), is also nicknamed \\"Death Valley\\", due to the area's history of suicides in the Middle Ages, and more recent hiking accidents. The valley became well known in 1970 when the remains of the mysterious Isdal Woman was discovered there. Another area of the mountain is called \\"Montana\\". Ulriksbanen opened in 1961 and was closed in 1974 after an accident. The cable car closed again in the 1980s due to lack of funds, and again in January 2006, due to the operating company failing to meet government requirements for documentation, but it reopened later in the spring of the same year. It was later closed again, but it reopened for business on May 1, 2009. The Ulriken Tunnel () is a single-line railway tunnel on the Bergen Line between Bergen Station and Arna Station.

S. Forester. It is the second book in the series chronologically, but the seventh by order of publication. The book is unique in the series in being told not from Horatio Hornblower's point of view, but rather from Bush's. This helped Forester to explain Hornblower's unsuitable first marriage besides giving an objective view of Hornblower himself.C. S. Forester (1964). The Hornblower Companion, London: Michael Joseph Ltd. pp. 120‚Äì21. (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press) This unusual narrative perspective also allows Forester to sustain a mystery, advanced hint by hint in the course of the novel, about how Captain Sawyer came to be injured--an event possibly witnessed by Hornblower. Plot summary William Bush, who becomes Hornblower's faithful companion and best friend, is introduced boarding HMS Renown as the third lieutenant. Hornblower is the fifth and most junior lieutenant. It is quickly apparent that Captain James Sawyer suffers from paranoia, constantly suspecting plots to undermine his authority and inflicting irrational and arbitrary punishments upon Hornblower and the other officers. A young volunteer named Wellard suffers particularly badly. Four of the lieutenants meet in secret in the lower decks to discuss what can be done, but are interrupted when Wellard warns them that the captain is on his way to arrest \\"mutineers\\". The officers scatter. Then they learn that the captain has fallen head-first into the hold. When the captain regains consciousness, he has entirely lost his reason due to the fall, and is incapable of resuming command. Buckland, the first lieutenant, takes charge. Ordered to capture an anchorage from which Spanish privateers are operating, he organises a clumsy frontal attack, which is repulsed. Hornblower suggests a surprise attack at night. Bush leads the successful attack, but it is Hornblower who is instrumental in negotiating the unconditional surrender of the remaining Spanish forces. The Spanish base at Saman√° is destroyed, a Spanish privateer and some small craft are captured and Buckland's promotion seems assured. Unfortunately for him, the Spanish prisoners seize control of the Renown during the night, taking Buckland prisoner while he is asleep in his cot. Hornblower alertly retakes the ship, but in the desperate fighting, Bush is severely wounded and the helpless Sawyer is killed. Upon their return to port, there is an awkward court of enquiry. Hornblower repeatedly denies any knowledge of how Captain Sawyer came to fall into the hold. Anxious to protect Sawyer's reputation, the court convicts no one, but Buckland is passed over, and Hornblower is promoted to commander. Unfortunately, the Peace of Amiens (1802) is signed before Hornblower's promotion can be confirmed, and he is restored to the rank of lieutenant. Moreover, the demotion is retroactive, so he must gradually repay the additional money he had received as commander. Reduced to poverty, he ekes out a living by playing whist for a modest stipend (plus whatever he wins or loses) at an upper-class gaming establishment. He resides in a lodging house, where he meets his future first wife Maria (n√©e Mason), the daughter of the landlady. Bush meets him several times, and notes in a newspaper that Midshipman Wellard, a suspect in Sawyer's fall into the hold, has drowned in an accident. The Peace of Amiens comes to an end in 1803. War has not yet begun, but is imminent, as evinced by a press gang Hornblower and Bush encounter. Hornblower's promotion is confirmed (by a Lord of the Admiralty he impresses with his exceptional cardplaying skills) and he is appointed commander of a sloop-of-war. Television adaptation This novel provides the material for episodes 5 and 6 of the Hornblower series of television films, which concern the voyage of the Renown and the subsequent enquiry, and for some scenes at the beginning of episode 7.

The Spit extends from the city's east end in a roughly southwesterly direction into Lake Ontario. The Leslie Street Spit, or officially the Outer Harbour East Headland, is a man-made headland in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, extending from the city's east end in a roughly southwesterly direction into Lake Ontario. It is about long. The Spit is the result of five decades of lakefilling by the Toronto Port Authority. It was conceived as an extension of Toronto Harbour, and has evolved into a largely passive recreation area. Naturalization had not been planned but the process is now actively managed by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority. A large portion of it is classified as an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and it is recognized as an Important Bird Area. Its common name is technically incorrect, since it is not truly a spit, but Torontonians almost never use the official name. The road running along the peninsula is a southern extension of Leslie Street, hence the popular nickname.  History  Leslie Beach looking east, 1935. The beach disappeared when the spit was constructed. The Spit is a man-made landfill that began in the 1950s when the Toronto Harbour Commission began a project to create a breakwater for Toronto's Outer Harbour. It was part of a plan to expand the capacity of the harbour in anticipation of an expected increase in shipping traffic on the Great Lakes after the Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959. However, owing to the containerization revolution of the 1960s, cargo traffic began to shift to East Coast ports, and shipping volumes in Toronto fell by almost half between 1969 and 1973. Thus, the need for an outer harbour never arose, and all cargo ships calling at Toronto still use the Inner Harbour, while the Outer Harbour sees only pleasure boat traffic. While the original need for the landform was eliminated, the site continued to receive excavation and construction waste from the building of Toronto's subways, office towers and other large projects. In the late 1970s, dredgeate from the nearby Keating Channel was also dumped on the emerging spit, which was seen as a better solution than dumping the polluted material into open water. Dredging is an ongoing process and PortsToronto continues to dump silt and mud in the Spit's embayments. In the early 1970s, the Spit was one of up to a dozen landfill parks across the Toronto-area shoreline planned by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA, but then known as the Metropolitan Toronto Regional Conservation Authority). It began as a long, slender finger of bare land stretching out into the lake, and developed several lobes enclosing small bays. It was eventually colonized by a variety of plant life. Development plans and political challenges Leslie Street Spit was the result of decades of land reclamation by the Toronto Port Authority. Beginning in the 1970s, these areas began to be converted into parks by the TRCA. The provincial government gave the TRCA the mandate to develop parks, beaches and recreation areas along the waterfront from Mississauga to Ajax. This was referred to as the Metro Waterfront Plan and excluded only the area between Leslie St. and Dufferin St. (roughly the eastern harbour to Ontario Place in the west). Even at this early stage, there were reports that there was little coordination between TRCA (a joint Metro Toronto - provincial body), the City's planning department and the federal Harbour Commission. From this period until 1985, the proposed public area on the Spit was referred to as the Aquatic Park. Public discussions on the future of the site in were held in June 1974 and proposed uses included mooring for over 500 boats, along with bicycling, picnicking and fishing facilities. A Master Plan was prepared for the TRCA and the details were publicized in March 1976. The consultants' report proposed significant development, including expanded marinas (now mooring for 1,500 boats), an amphitheatre, a water ski area and a hotel. Former City of Toronto councillor Colin Vaughan portrayed the consultation process as narrowly focused in a February 1977 article. Vaughan cited the following language from the terms of reference for the consultants: \\"to produce an active water- oriented recreation concept featuring major boating, swimming and aquatic facilities\\" and noted that only 20 acres of the 250 acres under study were set aside for naturalized areas. The Master Plan was criticized by several groups and in the end, governments were not prepared to fund the high cost on a relatively controversial proposal. In 1984, the TRCA launched a new planning process for the Spit as the organization acknowledged that the 1976 plan was \\"no longer appropriate\\". There was significant lobbying by sailing and naturalist groups, however, the Spit was becoming naturalized with little interference. In 1985, the TRCA announced that the northern portion of the Spit was designated as an environmentally sensitive area and that future plans would accommodate both recreational and naturalist groups. Land title Because it was newly created land, it was owned by the Crown and held by the provincial Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). The land set aside for the park was transferred to the TRCA in 1984. However, the MNR retains ownership of the active landfill portion of the spit. Friends of the Spit The Leslie Street Spit's evolution into an urban wilderness was never in the city's plans. The spit's status as such was secured by a number of organizations, with the citizens' advocacy group known as Friends of the Spit at the forefront of advocacy to naturalize the site. Structure View of the Outer Harbour's east headland and Vicki Keith Point. The inner part of the Spit consists of three embayments. These were designed to hold dredged material from the Inner Harbour and the Keating Channel. The first embayment has now been filled. It has been capped with clean fill and is being restored by the TRCA as a marsh. The remaining two embayments have about 50 years' capacity remaining. Between the Port Lands and the Spit lies the Outer Harbour. Part of this body of water was once the edge of a marsh that was part of Ashbridge's Bay. In the early 1980s, construction of an endikement on the eastern side of the embayments began. The endikement is designed as a rigid breakwater that protects the embayments and also deflects substantial sediment from the Inner Harbour. Access As late as 1973, there was no formal access to the Spit, although visits could be arranged with the Toronto Harbour Commission. However, by the summer of 1974, the Toronto Harbour Commission was providing bus service to the Spit on Sunday afternoons. The Spit is open to the public from 5:30 am. to 9:00 p.m. on weekends and statutory holidays (with the exception of Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day), and from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays. It is closed during the day on weekdays owing to the ongoing construction of the spit, conducted by PortsToronto. The Leslie Street Spit is a car-free area when the park is open, with strictly controlled vehicle access to the mooring area when the park is closed. The Spit's outermost end is known as Vicki Keith Point, after a famous Canadian swimmer. There has been an automated lighthouse there since 1974. Tommy Thompson Park The northern half of the Spit has been designated as Tommy Thompson Park, named after a former Toronto Parks Commissioner, and managed by the TRCA. The southern half is still an active dumping zone, managed by PortsToronto. Eventually the entire Spit will become parkland.  Important bird area  A snowy owl at the Spit. The area was designated an Important Bird Area by Nature Canada and Bird Studies Canada given its importance to a number of bird species. Quite a number of bird species are found on the Leslie Street Spit. More than 300 species of birds have been identified, 45 of which breed on the headland.W.G. Wilson, E.D. Cheskey. Leslie Street Spit, Tommy Thompson Park: Important Bird Area Conservation Plan. IBA Steering Committee. July 2001. Among the birds that may be observed on the headland are the ring- billed gull, the black-crowned night-heron, the double-crested cormorant, the common tern, the Caspian tern, and the herring gull. Owing to the Leslie Street Spit's importance to so many bird species, it has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by Nature Canada and Bird Studies Canada which are the Canadian partners of BirdLife International. Peninsula D has also become the site of a comprehensive bird research station, run by the TRCA. The Tommy Thompson Park Bird Research Station operates seven days a week during spring and fall migration, and runs other projects within the Greater Toronto Area throughout the rest of the year. Visitors to the station are welcome on weekends when the park is open.

He first appeared in X-Men #54 (March 1969). Abdol is the Living Pharaoh while in his normal appearance, but once he obtained enough cosmic energy, he would increase in mass, size, and power, thus becoming the Living Monolith. Abdol has mainly been an X-Men villain, usually using Havok to become the Living Monolith. He has also used other superheroes, including the Fantastic Four (who gained their super powers from exposure to cosmic rays). He even killed his own daughter to achieve his goal. Fictional character biography Ahmet Abdol was born in Cairo, Egypt. He was a professor of Egyptology and archeologist who discovered he had the ability to manipulate cosmic energy, mainly by absorbing it and projecting it as energy blasts. Deciding to use his powers for his own personal gain, Abdol created a cult around himself as messiah, the Cult of the Living Pharaoh, became a supervillain and set about his plan to rule the world. Abdol discovered that another mutant, Havok (Alex Summers, brother to Scott Summers also known as Cyclops) could absorb and project cosmic energy more easily than Abdol could. Abdol kidnapped Havok and used him to increase his power, and battled the X-Men.X-Men Vol. 1 #54-55 He then first became the Living Monolith, and battled the X-Men in this form.X-Men Vol. 1 #56-57 He was then captured by the Sentinels, but escaped.X-Men Vol. 1 #58-60 Abdol later stole the ruby scarab and battled the Living Mummy.Supernatural Thrillers #9 He later abducted Havok again. As the Living Monolith, he battled Spider-Man and Thor.Marvel Team-Up #69-70 Later, using the Cheops Crystal, he became the Living Monolith again. He battled Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Cyclops, Storm, and Nightcrawler.Power Man and Iron Fist #56-57 Later, Abdol abducted Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch to absorb cosmic radiation from their bodies. As he grew, he battled the Avengers and Spider-Man. Eventually Abdol grew so large that Thor used his hammer to throw him into outer space, where the Living Monolith eventually became a \\"Living Planet,\\" similar to Ego.Marvel Graphic Novel #17 His relative, Leila O'Toole, also known as Plasma, joins the Cult of the Living Pharaoh and tries to capture Havok for the Living Pharaoh.Marvel Comics Presents #24‚Äì31 It was later revealed that, although the Monolith is usually the one pulling the strings, another X-Men villain, Apocalypse, wanted to use the Living Monolith to drain the powers of other super-beings.Uncanny X-Men #376 (January 2000) As a result, Abdol went on a rampage, and several superheroes attempted to stop him before he began to grow to planet size. It was later revealed, also, that Abdol's formerly dormant mutant powers had been activated by a procedure performed on him by Mister Sinister. Sinister spliced certain x-genes from Alex Summers into his genome, thus giving Abdol the ability to absorb cosmic energy. Since his powers were modified to become genetically similar to Havok's, this explained why their abilities symbiotically interfered with one another's. During his time in space, one of the Monolith's main weapons, the Staff of Horus, was acquired by a young woman called Akasha. She was able to use that power to become a female version of the Living Pharaoh. Spider-Man was able to break the staff, leaving Akasha to depart the scene retaining only some fragments of the Pharaoh's power. Abdol was then found by Bishop and Deathbird floating in space. Deathbird revealed she'd been betraying Bishop for some time; it was later on revealed that she was in fact working for Apocalypse. She then knocked out Bishop and Abdol was brought to Apocalypse, who used Abdol's body as an energy container during The Twelve story arc. This led to Apocalypse's merging with Cyclops. The Monolith was seen breaking up because of the excess of power absorbed, and then fled. When the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak reappears on Earth and sends out a call to individuals suitable to become a new Juggernaut, Abdol hears the call and makes his way to the Temple of Cyttorak. Amidst conflict between demonic guardians of the Gem, the X-Men, and several prospective and former candidates for the Juggernaut's power, Abdol manages to claim the Gem, which transforms him into a towering amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut. However, after a brief rampage, Abdol was depowered again when Cyttorak, answering a challenge from former Juggernauts Cain Marko and Piotr Rasputin, chose to return the power to Marko.Amazing X-Men vol. 2 #17-18 Powers and abilities Ahmet Abdol, as the Living Pharaoh, is a mutant with the ability to absorb energy from cosmic rays. Absorbing this energy resulted in transforming Abdol into the Living Monolith, increasing his height to , and giving him proportionate superhuman physical abilities. As the Living Monolith he had the ability to emit cosmic energy as blasts of concussive force from his eyes. Abdol could only utilize his mutant powers as the Living Monolith and could transform into the Living Monolith only when cosmic radiation was channeled into his body through a focusing medium, such as the Cheops Crystal, or when cosmic radiation was prevented from reaching his counterpart, Havok. The Living Monolith has been genetically altered by splicing his own mutant genes with those of the mutant X-Man Havok. This modification allows him to absorb large amounts of cosmic radiation - although as Havok absorbs the same radiation, the Living Monolith's powers can be limited when Havok absorbs background radiation (or other suitable energy sources) that might otherwise be used to fuel the Living Monolith. Although Havok projects absorbed radiation as energy blasts, the Living Monolith had a broader range of powers. He is able to project energy as intense heat, a concussive force, or sonic vibrations. Stored energy also affects his physical form - increasing his size, mass, and power, and granting him an indefinite lifespan. Although there appears to be no clear upper limit to the amount of power he can absorb, it is also possible to overload his powers. The Living Monolith has additionally demonstrated telepathic abilities enabling him to read minds and take complete mental control over small crowds of people. Abdol wore body armor of unknown materials. As the Living Pharaoh, he wielded a hand-held ankh capable of projecting bursts of concussive force. Abdol has a gifted intellect, and is an expert archeologist and Egyptologist, with a Ph.D. in archeology. He is also an advance student of genealogy, human mutation, and the effects of cosmic radiation.

Members of the breed are found that resemble all three of the foundation breeds, leading to three recognized types: Straight or Foundation (an even cross between the Arabian and stock horse types), Stock (a heavier emphasis on stock horse breeding) and Pleasure (a heavier emphasis on Arabian breeding). Although there have been records of crosses between the three breeds throughout the history of their respective registries, the first Quarab registry was formed in 1984, but later went out of business. In 1999, the International Quarab Horse Association was formed and remains the leading force in Quarab breeding. In order to be registered with the IQHA, horses must have at least 1/8 blood from both the Arabian and stock horse types. Breed characteristics Quarab mare in early winter coat Quarabs are found that have characteristics of both Arabian and stock horse (Quarter horse or Paint) bloodlines, with individual horses' characteristics are based on the ratio of Arabian to stock horse blood. Arabian types tend to have longer necks and barrels and level croups, while stock horse types tend to have more muscular legs and rounded croups. In height they range from . The International Quarab Horse Association accepts horses of all colors and patterns, with the exception of leopard complex spotting, which is not accepted by the registry. There are three recognized types of Quarabs: Straight or Foundation, Stock and Pleasure. Straight/Foundation horses are an almost even blend of Arabian and stock horse traits, showing the influence of both bloodlines equally. This type is sought by most breeders, and is the type on which the registry standard is based. The Stock type Quarab has a greater amount of either Quarter or Paint horse breeding and traits; this type is often used by ranchers and Western riding breeders. The Pleasure type shows a strong Arabian influence, with less traits from the stock horse - these horses are often favored by endurance riders. Quarabs are found competing in many sports, including Western riding disciplines such as reining and roping and English riding sports such as dressage. They are also seen in use for driving, endurance and general pleasure riding. History Crosses between Arabians, Quarter Horses and Paints are recorded throughout the history of the Quarter Horse and Paint horse associations. For example, in the 1950s, the Arabian stallion Indraff sired two foals, a filly and a colt, by the Quarter Horse mare Cotton Girl. Both foals went on to successful careers, with the filly, named Indy Sue, earning an American Quarter Horse Association Performance Register of Merit and herself foaling three registered Quarter Horses. Before the American Paint Horse Association stud book was closed in the 1980s, a few sabino Arabian stallions were inspected and registered. In 1984, the United Quarab Registry (UQR) was formed as the breed association for Quarter Horse/Arabian crossbred horses. In 1989, a new section of the registry, called the Painted Quarab Index, was added to include horses with blood from the American Paint Horse that showed tobiano and overo color patterns. The UQR was privately owned and later went out of business after a change of ownership. In 1999 the International Quarab Horse Association was formed to register the breed, functioning under the same guidelines as the UQR and soon spreading overseas, with member groups in Germany and the Netherlands. The registry only accepts horses bred from parents registered with the respective breed registries - the American Quarter Horse Association, the Arabian Horse Association and the American Paint Horse Association, and horses must have at least 1/8 blood from either the Arabian or the stock (Quarter or Paint) horse parent.

S. Forester. It is the third book in the series chronologically, but the tenth by order of publication, and serves as the basis for one of the episodes of the Hornblower series of television films. Plot summary On 2 April 1802 Hornblower marries Maria, the daughter of his landlady, at the \\"church of St Thomas √† Becket\\" in Portsmouth. He is unable to bring himself to be so cruel as to stop the ceremony despite thinking that \\"Maria was not the right woman to be his wife.\\" Hornblower had, just days before, been promoted commander into HM sloop Hotspur as the fragile Peace of Amiens is breaking down and Britain is re-arming for a new war with France under Napoleon Bonaparte. Hotspur reconnoiters the approaches to the French naval base of Brest, and narrowly avoids capture when war is declared. Once the British fleet blockades Brest, Hornblower's restlessness and perfectionism prompts him to lead attacks and landing parties. He defeats a French attempt to break the blockade to send troops to Ireland, the action ending on the morning of 1 January 1804. That same day Maria gives birth to little Hornblower, as Hornblower discovers when the damaged Hotspur returns to Plymouth for repairs. In spite of his successes Hornblower makes no financial profit from his activities. When Admiral William Cornwallis tries to put him in a position where he can make easy prize money by capturing a large shipment of Spanish gold, he instead takes on a stronger enemy frigate sent to warn the convoy and keeps it from accomplishing its mission. Eventually, by superior seamanship and skill, he drives it away. Hornblower rationalises that this is poetic justice, after he had earlier connived to facilitate the escape of his steward, who was facing hanging for striking a superior officer (a punishment Hornblower could not abide). It later transpires that the ships were claimed by the Government as (Droits of Admiralty) so that Hornblower would not have profited in any case. (Prize money was only paid to naval officers and men for ships they captured as part of a war, and Britain was not at war with Spain until soon afterwards.) Hornblower is recommended for promotion to post captain as one of the final acts of the retiring Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet, Admiral Cornwallis, a real figure outside of the Hornblower novels.

He served four terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1991. He was the first congressman to be disciplined for sexual harassment. Biography Bates was born in Denver, Colorado, and graduated from East High School (Denver) in 1959. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1959, and served in the Corps until 1963. Relocating to San Diego, Bates became a banker and was employed in the aerospace industry. He obtained his bachelor's degree from San Diego State University in 1975.  Political career  Bates was elected to the San Diego city council in 1971 and served until 1974. He was elected chairman of the San Diego County board of supervisors in 1974, and held the position until 1982. At the time he was the youngest chairman of the board.  US House of Representatives  Bates resigned from the board in 1982 to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing California's newly created 44th Congressional District. The district was created after the 1980 census round of redistricting as the most Democratic district in the San Diego area; it included much of the territory represented for 18 years by Lionel Van Deerlin before his defeat by Duncan Hunter. Bates won election in 1982 with 65% of the vote, and was re-elected in 1984, 1986, and 1988, with 69.7%, 64.2%, and 59.7% of the vote, respectively. Bates was defeated in the 1990 election 46.3%-44.8% by Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham. Bates ran in the Democratic primary in June 1992 for the newly created 50th District, which included much of his former territory. However, he lost the nomination to his former aide, Bob Filner.  Ethics investigations and sexual harassment  In 1988 stories surfaced of Bates having groped and touched women who worked for him as well as others. Dorena Bertussi, a legislative assistant for Bates, testified that \\"he put my leg in between his and started to do a bump and grind on it, like a dog,\\" and sued Bates for sexual harassment. In 1989, Bates was reprimanded by the House with their lightest possible censure, a \\"letter of reproval\\". He was the first congressman to be sanctioned by the House for sexual harassment; his case is now explicitly cited in the House ethics manual as an example of impermissible sexual harassment. Following Bates's loss in the 1990 election, Bertussi dropped her suit against him. Bates was later implicated in the House banking scandal; he had written four bad checks to his congressional campaign.  Later career  In 2017 Bates founded the United States-Bangladesh Friendship Group, of which he is currently Executive Director. That group helps promotes clean water supplies and recently facilitated delivery of $3.7 million in medical equipment and supplies, donated by the non-profit Helping Hand.

It is currently a subsidiary of HarperCollins. History George Bartholomew (8 January 1784 ‚Äì 23 October 1871, active from 1797) worked as an engraver for Daniel Lizars Sr. in Edinburgh. His son, John Bartholomew Senior (1805 - 9 April 1861), began working independently in about 1826, founding the firm that bears his name. Notable work included Black‚Äôs General Atlas of 1846. John Bartholomew Junior (1831‚Äì1893) and his son John George Bartholomew (1860‚Äì1920) brought the firm to prominence. In particular, J.G. Bartholomew made the firm a publisher of its own works, rather than a producer of maps for other firms. John (Ian) Bartholomew (1890‚Äì1962) oversaw the Times Survey Atlas of the World (1922) and later the Mid-Century Edition of the Times Atlas of the World (1955‚Äì60). The cartographic tradition continued into a fifth family generation. John Christopher Bartholomew (1923‚Äì2008) shared his ancestors' fascination with the natural sciences, their meticulous standards and spirit of enterprise, and oversaw the publication of some of the most detailed and popular maps of the last century, including The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World (1967). His brother Robert, who was trained in printing, soon became the production director, and another brother, Peter, who was trained in accountancy, was first appointed as managing director and later became executive chairman. In 1989, the firm merged with the Glasgow publisher Collins, as part of the multinational HarperCollins Publishers under Rupert Murdoch's News International corporation. A wide range of maps and atlases are still being published today under the imprint of HarperCollins, but the name of Bartholomew survives as the trade name of HarperCollins' cartographic databases (Collins Bartholomew), based in Bishopbriggs (Glasgow). The British Isles mapping arm (formerly Geographia Ltd.) was based in Cheltenham until that office was closed in 2009 and remaining staff made redundant in 2010. Collins Geo in Bishopbriggs continues to handle world mapping, British Isles map products, and sales of geographical data. Publications Bartholomew was the only survivor of a number of important map publishers in Scotland, and was notable for a prolific output and variety of maps and atlases for academic, commercial and travel purposes, including the popular 62-sheet Half-Inch to One Mile map series of Great Britain, which transmuted into the 1:100,000 National map series in the 1970s. It was eventually discontinued owing largely to stiff competition from the state-financed Ordnance Survey. John Bartholomew Junior was credited with having pioneered the use of hypsometric tints or layer colouring on maps in which low ground is shown in shades of green and higher ground in shades of brown, then eventually purple and finally white. It is his son John George who is attributed with being the first to bring the name 'Antarctica' into popular use as the name for the Southern Continent, and for the adoption of red or pink as the colour for the British Empire. The firm's first major work as a publisher was The Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Atlas of Scotland (1895), later called the Survey Atlas of Scotland, which was followed by the Survey Atlas of England and Wales (1903). In 1922 the company was responsible for the production of a major new atlas for The Times newspaper: The Times Survey Atlas of the World. This would later become The Times Comprehensive Atlas, which received a notable boost when a new Millennium edition was published using digital map production technology for the first time. The atlas continues to be a 'must-have' for libraries and better-off homes, on account of its almost unrivalled size combined with a policy of detailed updating. Another great Bartholomew reference atlas was the well-known Citizen's Atlas of the World, which ran through ten editions (1898‚Äì1952). Other notable publications include two volumes of the ambitious Physical Atlas: Meteorology (1899) and Zoogeography (1911), based on the landmark Berghaus Physikalischer Atlas. John Bartholomew & Son Ltd officially ceased to exist when it was de-registered at Companies House in 1995. A new company using the name John Bartholomew & Son Ltd (Companies House SC194433) was registered in Scotland on 18 March 1999. It is based at Hardengreen Business Park just outside Edinburgh, and is owned by former staff. Relocation The company was relocated from its offices in Duncan Street, Edinburgh, in 1995 to HarperCollins‚Äô Glasgow offices in Westerhill Road, Bishopbriggs. Many long-serving staff left at that time. The Duncan Street office in Edinburgh had been built in 1911 using the imposing Palladian fa√ßade of a former Bartholomew family home, Falcon Hall, and this now forms the frontage for a series of up-market flats created from the former offices. The works behind the offices were demolished and replaced by new blocks of flats, which were named by the builder after famous Scottish writers who had no connection with Bartholomews' or cartography. An unveiling ceremony was attended by the Princess Royal - an indication of the high national and international prestige long held by the company. The departure of the company from Edinburgh after some 170 years in the city was a notable moment in the history of map-making in Scotland, but little was made of the move in the public media, and it was left largely to the initiative of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and George Russell (not an employee) to arrange for the erection of a commemorative plaque with the cooperation of the last John Bartholomew. Archives The Maps Reading Room of the National Library of Scotland (which is located near the former Duncan Street offices) contains the extensive archives of the Bartholomew company, a product of a long and fruitful association between the two organisations. A book, still available from the company at its post-1995 address in Bishopbriggs, Glasgow (Bartholomew - 150 Years), details the history and achievements of Bartholomews‚Äô up to the time of its 150th anniversary in 1976, not very long after the last of the copperplate engravers retired and the company started to pioneer the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and computer-generated mapping for its cartographic publishing and for the selling of map data. Robert Gordon Bartholomew, of the sixth generation of cartographers, has extensively researched and documented the genealogy not only of his own branch of the family, but also of several other Bartholomew families. His work upholds the belief held by many Bartholomews that all Bartholomews of Scottish origin are related. John G. Bartholomew built and inhabited \\"Overton House\\" in Ealing, London, now home of a lay centre (Benedictine Study and Arts Centre).

It is often done one or more times a day and can vary amongst the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana sects. The liturgy mainly consists of chanting or reciting a sutra or passages from a sutra, a mantra (especially in Vajrayana), and several gathas. Depending on what practice the practitioner wishes to undertake, it can be done at a temple or at home. The liturgy is almost always performed in front of an object or objects of veneration and accompanied by offerings of light, incense, water and/or food. Chinese Buddhist liturgy The traditional Chinese Buddhist liturgy for morning chanting (), evening chanting (), and regularly scheduled Dharma services () in the Chan and Pure Land schools combine mantras, recitation of the Buddha's name and physical and spiritual practices, such as bowing and walking meditation and vow making.Buddhist Text Translation Society (2013). Daily Recitation Handbook, bilingual Chinese/English editionSutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada (1993). The Buddhist Liturgy, Taiwan: Buddha Educational Foundation. Sitting meditation often occurs before or after the liturgy. A typical order for chanting at these services is: # Refuge in the Buddha (three times) # Incense offering praise (on certain occasions) # Sutra Opening Verse # Sutra Reading # Sapta Jina Bhasitam Papa Vinas ana Dharani () # Refuge in the Triple Gem # Offering to Wei Tuo # Transfer of Merits # Dhanya Dharani () # Closing Verse () # Bowing in homage to ancestral patriarchs (on certain occasions) Japanese Buddhist liturgy (gongy≈ç) In Japan, gongyo is also sometimes called o-tsutome („ÅäÂã§„ÇÅ) or sh≈çjin (Á≤æÈÄ≤). All three terms are common Japanese words and none is specific to any particular sect or school. Origin of the word \\"gongyo\\" The word gongyo originated in ancient China; although nowadays it is more often used in Buddhism, it first appeared in the Taoism classic Zhuang Zi.Zhuang Zi: ‚Äú‰ª•Âæ∑‰∏∫Âæ™ËÄÖÔºåË®ÄÂÖ∂‰∏éÊúâË∂≥ËÄÖËá≥‰∫é‰∏ò‰πüÔºõËÄå‰∫∫Áúü‰ª•‰∏∫Âã§Ë°åËÄÖ‰πü„ÄÇ‚Äù Its original meaning is \\"assiduous or hard and frequent walking/practice\\". Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi abstracted and modified this word from an earlier classic of Taoism - Laozi's Tao Te Ching, in which it states:‚Äú‰∏äÂ£´ÈóªÈÅìÔºåÂã§ËÄåË°å‰πã‚Äù, which means taking effort and practicing. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the buddhist philosophy developed dramatically in central China, and was influenced by Taoism. Chinese Buddhist philosophers borrowed this word from Taoism classics, and it spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam with Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism Butsudan with enshrined Amida Buddha The concept of gongy≈ç is also common in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist schools such as Jodo ShuDaily Service, Jodo Shu Research Institute and Jodo Shinshu. The central practice of these schools is the recitation of the name of Amida, also called the nembutsu, but in daily practice a Pure Land practitioner will also chant excerpts of the Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life, particular the sections titled the Sanbutsuge or the Juseige, and in some temples chanting the entire Smaller Sutra of Immeasurable Life may occur once daily or alternatively only on more formal occasions. In larger Pure Land temples, the daily service is performed by priests or ministers, and lay people can optionally attend and recite along if they wish. The times for these services will vary depending on the individual branch, and individual temple. In traditional Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, lay practitioners may also chant a hymn written by Shinran called the Shoshinge, which is not a sutra per se, but expounds the lineage with which Jodo Shinshu owes its beliefs. A shorter hymn called the Junirai, the Twelve Praises of Amida, can be used as well. In Jodo Shu, the nembutsu (Namu Amida Butsu) is often recited is specific format: * Junen: The nembutsu is recited 8 times in one breath, without the final 'tsu' sound, then recited fully in one breath, and recited a final time without the 'tsu' sound again. This is 10 recitations total * Nembutsu Ichie: The nembutsu is repeated as many times as the practitioners choose to. * Sanshorai: The nembutsu is recited 3 times in a long, drawn-out fashion, after which the practitioner bows. This process is repeated twice more for a total of 9 recitations. Shingon Buddhism The gongyo of Shingon Buddhism differs amongst various sub-sects, but all of them mainly recite the Hannya Shingyo, the mantras of the Thirteen Buddhas and other mantras, the Light Mantra, and the gohogo; the saintly name of Kukai.Shingonji Temple (2011). The Shingon School's Layperson's Morning Service Order, Lomita, California Gongyo is important for lay Shingon Buddhists to follow since the practice emphasizes meditation of the body, speech and mind of a buddha. Nichiren Buddhism Nichiren Buddhists perform a form of gongyo that consists of reciting certain passages of the Lotus Sutra and chanting daimoku. The format of gongyo varies by denomination and sect. Some, like Nichiren Shoshu and Nichiren Shu, have a prescribed formula which is longheld in their practice, while others such as the Soka Gakkai International variedly change their gongyo formats depending on modernity, the most recent being the 2015 edition of their liturgy format. =Soka Gakkai International= In the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), gongyo is performed to \\"return to the very foundation of our lives\\" and \\"draw wisdom\\" from inherent Buddha nature, and achieves \\"the fusion or reality and wisdom\\" Nichiren established no formal procedure for gongyo other than the recitation of the 2nd and 16th chapters of the Lotus Sutra, and at times even just the verse section of the 16th chapter. Hence the format had changed from time to time through the centuries. At the time the Soka Gakkai came into being, Nichiren Buddhist laity were not expected to do gongyo themselves; priests did it on their behalf. The first two presidents of the Soka Gakkai, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, taught members \\"not to hire priests to chant, as had long been customary, but to chant for themselves, a change they found both disarming and empowering\\" The current format has evolved over the years. Originally, it followed the format of Nichiren Shoshu. In the 1970s, silent prayers were added for the success of the Soka Gakkai itself, and in memory of its first two deceased presidents, in addition to prayers for Nichiren and his disciple Nikko. Currently, after the recitation of the 2nd chapter and the verse section of the 16th chapter, daimoku is chanted for as long as desired, after which all the silent prayers are recited to conclude gongyo. The SGI's version of sutra recitation takes approximately 5 minutes, leaving more time for the primary practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. As of 2015, the silent prayers currently are: gratitude to the Gohonzon, to Nichiren, and to his immediate successor Nikko; appreciation for the three founding presidents of the organization; a prayer for the fulfillment of the great vow for worldwide kosen-rufu, for the human revolution and attainment of goals of the practitioner, and for the deceased; and finally for the happiness of all living beings. It is emphasized by the Soka Gakkai, however, that more important than the wording of the prayers is the practitioner's heartfelt intent in doing gongyo and expressing his or her appreciation and desires. =Nichiren Shu= Nichiren Shu has many types of gongyo a person can perform.Nichiren-Shu Service Book: Dharma, Nichiren Buddhist International Center, Lexington Nichiren Buddhist Community (2005). Jogyo-Shindoku, Traditional Auxiliary Practice, Lexington Kentucky One example of family service procedure is as follows: #Invocation (Invitation to the Buddha, Dharma and Samgha to be present at this service) #Kaikyo-ge (Opening Canon) #Lotus Sutra Ch. 2 Hoben-pon #Lotus Sutra Ch. 16 Juryo-hon (Jiga-ge) #Chanting Odaimoku Namu Myoho Renge Kyo #Lotus Sutra last part of Ch. 11 Hoto-ge (The difficulty in keeping this Sutra) #Prayer #Four Great Vows: ::Sentient beings are innumerable; I vow to save them all. ::Our evil desires are inexhaustible; I vow to quench them all. ::The Buddha's teachings are immeasurable; I vow to study them all. ::The way of the Buddha is unexcelled; I vow to attain the path sublime. *Chapter 2 (Hoben-pon) and Chapter 16 (Juryo-hon) are recited the most frequently; *Chapter 12 Daibadatta-hon, *Chapter 16 in its entirety *Chapter 21 Jinriki-hon (whole or from \\"Shobukkusesha\\") or *Chapter 25 Kannon- gyo. Recitation of the Lotus Sutra can be performed in Shindoku or one's own preferred language. There is additional form of gongyo performed by Nichiren Shu practitioners at homes and in temples in which the entire Lotus Sutra is recited over the course of 32 days. =Nichiren Shoshu= In Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´, gongyo is in principle performed twice daily, upon rising (\\"morning gongyo\\") and before retiring (\\"evening gongyo\\").Nichiren Shoshu Temple West Hollywood, California (2003). Nichiren Shoshu Basics of Practice Its recitations of the Lotus Sutra are composed of the following: * The prose section of the second chapter * The prose and verse section of the 16th chapter (2nd recitation only) * The verse section of the 16th chapter. * Prolonged Hiki-Daimoku with five or three silent prayers. In total, the following format is observed: * Five sutra recitations are made each morning (silent prayers 1-5). * Three sutra recitations are made each evening (silent prayers 2,3,5). It is the act of offering the sutra, daimoku (the invocation Nam-myoho-renge-kyo), and silent prayers to the Gohonzon, the object of veneration. Offering the sutra entails reciting the Expedient Means (second) and the Life Span of the Tathagata (sixteenth) chapters of the Lotus Sutra; the silent prayers are five formal meditations expressing gratitude for the Three Treasures as defined in Nichiren Shoshu, and the merit accrued through Buddhist practices. Buddhist piety is a common sentiment found in Gongyo among Nichiren Shoshu members. Members of Nichiren Shoshu may only use Juzu prayer beads with pure white cords and white Pom-Pom ornaments, while Nichiren Shoshu priests use an additional set of Juzu prayer beads with white string tassels which they use towards Kito and Lotus Sutra blessings. The rubbing of Juzu prayer beads is prohibited during both Gongyo and Shodai or prolonged chanting in Nichiren Shoshu. Like in Nichiren Shu and other Nichiren-related sects, the sutra recitation is done in the Japanese phonetic pronunciation of My≈çh≈ç- Renge-Ky≈ç, the Chinese translation of the Lotus Sutra by Kumarajiva. The number of recitations depends on which silent prayer is to be offered. The established format consist of five in the morning and three in the evening, with the Expedient Means and Life Span of the Tathagata chapters recited once for each silent prayer offered. The full Life Span of the Tathagata Chapter is recited only for the second prayer (an expression of appreciation to the Dai- Gohonzon); for all others, only the \\"verse\\" portion is recited. Each recitation of the sutra passages is followed three \\"prolonged daimoku\\" (hiki- daimoku, wherein each syllable pronounced distinctly and drawn out: \\"Na-Mu, My≈ç-H≈ç‚ÄìRen-Ge‚ÄìKy≈ç‚Äì\\") and the corresponding silent prayer, except for the final recitation of the service, which is followed by the chanting of 100 or more daimoku and the final silent prayer. Note that the number of or the length of time daimoku is chanted between the final sutra recitation and silent prayer, is discretionary.Nichiren Shoshu liturgy Variations on this basic gongyo format, consisting of different combinations of the Expedient Means Chapter and parts of the Life Span of the Tathagata Chapter, are also offered on certain occasions, such as at mid-day meetings, before chanting daimoku for extended periods, and at funerals and celebrations. The most important gongyo service in Nichiren Shoshu is the Ushitora Gongyo performed daily by the high priest or his proxy (when he is unable to officiate). Ushitora Gongyo takes place in the Grand Reception Hall of Head Temple Taisekiji and follows the format of the five-prayer morning gongyo service. It is done between the eponymous hours of the ox (ushi, 02:00) and the tiger (tora, 04:00), usually starting at 02:30 and taking about 50 minutes. Its purpose is to pray for the worldwide propagation of Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Buddhism and‚Äîby extension‚Äîthe peace and prosperity of all the world's peoples.Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Temple West Hollywood, California (2003). Nichiren Shoshu Basics of Practice, pp. 94-96. An example of Buddhist juzu prayer beads used by many Japanese Buddhist sects The significance of performing Ushitora Gongyo at this time of day derives from earlier Buddhist teachings that describe the hour of the ox as \\"the end of darkness\\" and the hour of the tiger as \\"the beginning of light,\\" and ones that describe all Buddhas as having attained enlightenment at this time. The passage from the hour of the ox to the hour of the tiger therefore symbolizes the transition from the unenlightened condition of a common mortal to the enlightened condition of a Buddha, so the performance of gongyo at this hour serves as a reminder of the true purpose of Buddhist practice: to achieve enlightenment in this lifetime.

The area of the county, excluding the city of Aberdeen itself, is also a lieutenancy area. The county borders Kincardineshire, Angus and Perthshire to the south, Inverness-shire and Banffshire to the west, and the North Sea to the north and east. It has a coast-line of . Between 1890 and 1975, Aberdeenshire was one of the administrative counties of Scotland, governed by a county council. In 1900, the county town of Aberdeen became a county of a city and was thus removed from the administrative county. In 1975 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 reorganised local administration in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts. The administrative counties of Aberdeenshire, the City of Aberdeen, Banffshire, Kincardineshire and most of Morayshire were merged to form Grampian Region, with the area of county being divided between the districts of City of Aberdeen, Banff and Buchan, Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside for administration. In 1996 Scottish local government system was reorganised a second time to form a single tier of unitary council areas. The name was revived in local government for the council area of Aberdeenshire, which has vastly different boundaries. The area is generally hilly, and from the south-west, near the centre of Scotland, the Grampians send out various branches, mostly to the north-east.  Symbols  Arms of the former county council The coat of arms of Aberdeenshire County Council was granted in 1890. The four quarters represented the Buchan, Mar, Garioch and Strathbogie areas.R M Urquhart, Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry, London 1973 Constituencies  There was an Aberdeenshire constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1868. This constituency did not include the parliamentary burgh of Aberdeen, which was represented as a component of Aberdeen District of Burghs until 1832, when it was enlarged and became the Aberdeen burgh constituency. The other components of the district of burghs became components of the then new Montrose District of Burghs. In 1868 the Aberdeenshire constituency was divided to form two new county divisions, or county constituencies, namely Eastern Aberdeenshire and Western Aberdeenshire. In 1885 the Aberdeen burgh constituency was divided to form the burgh constituencies of Aberdeen North and Aberdeen South. In 1918 Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire were treated as if a single county for parliamentary representation purposes, with the area of the Kincardineshire county constituency and the Aberdeenshire constituencies being divided into three new constituencies, Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen and Kincardine Central and Aberdeen and Kincardine East. Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire included the whole of the former Kincardineshire constituency. In 1950 the area of the former Kincardinshire constituency (as abolished in 1918) was merged into the then new North Angus and Mearns constituency, and the Aberdeenshire area was divided into the East Aberdeenshire constituency and the West Aberdeenshire constituency, but the boundary between these new eastern and western constituencies differed from that for the constituencies of the 1868 to 1918 period. Boundary changes in 1955 enlarged the Aberdeenshire West constituency, and reduced the size of the Aberdeenshire East constituency. In 1983, eight years after the local government county of Aberdeenshire was abolished, the Aberdeenshire constituencies were replaced with new constituencies. Geography Sand-dunes on the coast near Newburgh Aberdeenshire has been traditionally divided into five districts: *Mar, mostly between the Dee and Don, which nearly covers the southern half of the county and contains the city of Aberdeen. It is mountainous, especially Braemar, which contains the greatest mass of elevated land in the British Isles. The Dee valley has sandy soil, the Don valley loamy. *Formartine, between the lower Don and Ythan, has a sandy coast, which is succeeded inland by a clayey, fertile, tilled tract, and then by low hills, moors, mosses and tilled land. *Buchan lies north of the Ythan, and comprising the north-east of the county, is next in size to Mar, parts of the coast being bold and rocky, the interior bare, low, flat, undulating and in places peaty. On the coast, six miles (10 km) south of Peterhead, are the Bullers of Buchan ‚Äì a basin in which the sea, entering by a natural arch, boils up violently in stormy weather. Buchan Ness is the most easterly point of Scotland. *Garioch, in the centre of the shire, comprises an undulating, loamy, fertile valley, formerly called the granary of Aberdeen. *Strathbogie, occupying a considerable area south of the Deveron, mostly consists of hills, moors and mosses. Cairn Toul in the Cairngorms The interior mountains of the Cairngorms provide the most striking of the physical features of the county: *Ben Macdhui, , a magnificent mass, the second highest mountain in the United Kingdom (shared with Banffshire) *Braeriach *Cairn Toul, *Beinn a' Bh√πird, *Ben Avon, *\\"Dark\\" Lochnagar, *Cairn Eas, , *Sgarsoch, *Culardoch Farther north rise the Buck of Cabrach, on the Banffshire border, Tap o' Noth, , Bennachie, , which from its central position is a landmark visible from many different parts of the county, and which is celebrated in John Imlah's song, O gin I war faur the Gadie rins, and Foudland, . Loch Muick in winter The chief rivers are the Dee, long; the Don, ; the Ythan, , with mussel-beds at its mouth; the Ugie, , and the Deveron, , partly on the boundary of Banffshire. In 1911 the rivers abounded with salmon and trout, and the pearl mussel occurs in the Ythan and Don. A valuable pearl in the Scottish crown is said to be from the Ythan. Loch Muick, the largest of the few lakes in the county, above the sea, long and broad, lies some southwest of Ballater, and has Altnagiuthasach, a royal shooting-box, near its south-western end. Loch Strathbeg, southeast of Fraserburgh, is only separated from the sea by a narrow strip of land. There are noted chalybeate springs at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and Pannanich near Ballater. Other lochs of note are Loch Kinord, Loch Davan, Dubh Loch, Lochnagar, Sandy Loch, Loch Callater, Loch Phadraig, Loch nan Eun and the Loch of Skene. Geology The greater part of the county is composed of crystalline schists belonging to the metamorphic rocks of the Eastern Highlands. In the upper parts of the valleys of the Dee and the Don they form well-marked groups, of which the most characteristic are: #the black schists and phyllites, with flints, and a thin band of tremolite limestone, #the main or Blair Atholl limestone, #the quartzite. These divisions are folded on highly inclined or vertical axes trending north-east and south-west, and hence the same zones are repeated over a considerable area. The quartzite is generally regarded as the highest member of the series. Excellent sections showing the component strata occur in Glen Clunie and its tributary valleys above Braemar. Eastwards down the Dee and the Don and northwards across the plain of Buchan towards Rattray Head and Fraserburgh there is a development of biotite gneiss, partly of sedimentary and perhaps partly of igneous origin. A belt of slate which has been quarried for roofing purposes runs along the west border of the county from Turriff by Auchterless and the Foudland Hills towards the Tap o' Noth near Gartly. The metamorphic rocks have been invaded by igneous materials, some before, and by far the larger series after the folding of the strata. The basic types of the former are represented by the sills of epidiorite and hornblende gneiss in Glen Muick and Glen Callater, which have been permeated by granite and pegmatite in veins and lenticles, often foliated. The later granites subsequent to the plication of the schists have a wide distribution on the Ben Macdhui and Ben Avon range, and on Lochnagar; they stretch eastwards from Ballater by Tarland to Aberdeen and north to Bennachie. Isolated masses appear at Peterhead and at Strichen. Though consisting mainly of biotite granite, these later intrusions pass by intermediate stages into diorite, as in the area between Balmoral and the head-waters of the Gairn. The granites have been extensively quarried at Rubislaw, Peterhead and Kemnay. Serpentinite and troctolite, the precise age of which is uncertain, occur at the Black Dog Rock north of Aberdeen, at Belhelvie and near Old Meldrum. Where the schists of sedimentary origin have been pierced by these igneous intrusions, they are charged with contact minerals such as sillimanite, cordierite, kyanite and andalusite. Cordierite- bearing rocks occur near Ellon, at the foot of Bennachie, and on the top of the Buck of Cabrach. A banded and mottled calc-silicate hornfels occurring with the limestone at Derry Falls, west-northwest of Braemar, has yielded malacolite, wollastonite, brown idocrase, garnet, sphene and hornblende. A larger list of minerals has been obtained from an exposure of limestone and associated beds in Glen Gairn, about four miles (6 km) above the point where that river joins the Dee. Narrow belts of Old Red Sandstone, resting unconformably on the old platform of slates and schists, have been traced from the north coast at Peterhead by Turriff to Fyvie, and also from Huntly by Gartly to Kildrummy Castle. The strata consist mainly of conglomerates and sandstones, which, at Gartly and at Rhynie, are associated with lenticular bands of andesite indicating contemporaneous volcanic action. Small outliers of conglomerate and sandstone of this age have recently been found in the course of excavations in Aberdeen. The glacial deposits, especially in the belt bordering the coast between Aberdeen and Peterhead, furnish important evidence. The ice moved eastwards off the high ground at the head of the Dee and the Don, while the mass spreading outwards from the Moray Firth invaded the low plateau of Buchan; but at a certain stage there was a marked defection northwards parallel with the coast, as proved by the deposit of red clay north of Aberdeen. At a later date the local glaciers laid down materials on top of the red clay. The committee appointed by the British Association proved that the Greensand, which has yielded a large suite of Cretaceous fossils at Moreseat, in the parish of Cruden, occurs in glacial drift, resting probably on granite. The strata from which the Moreseat fossils were derived are not now found in place in that part of Scotland, but Mr Jukes Brown considers that the horizon of the fossils is that of the lower Greensand of the Isle of Wight or the Aptien stage of France. Chalk flints are widely distributed in the drift between Fyvie and the east coast of Buchan. At Plaidy a patch of clay with Liassic fossils occurs. At several localities between Logie Coldstone and Dinnet a deposit of diatomite (Kieselguhr) occurs beneath the peat. Flora and fauna The tops of the highest mountains have an Arctic flora. At the royal lodge on Loch Muick, above the sea, grow larches, vegetables, currants, laurels, roses, etc. Some ash-trees, 1 to 1.5 m (4 or 5 ft) in girth, grow at above the sea. Trees, especially Scotch fir and larch, grow well, and Braemar has plentiful natural timber, said to surpass any in the north of Europe. Stumps of Scotch fir and oak found in peat sometimes far exceed any now growing in size. Moles occur at above the sea, and squirrels at . Grouse, partridges and hares abound, and rabbits are often numerous. Red deer abound in Braemar, which in 1911 had the most extensive deer forest in Scotland. Economy=Agriculture Except in the mountainous districts, Aberdeenshire has a comparatively mild climate, owing to the proximity of much of the shire to the sea. The mean annual temperature at Braemar reaches , and that at Aberdeen . The mean yearly rainfall varies from about . In summer the upper Dee and Don valleys provide the driest and most bracing climate in the British Isles, and grain grows cultivated up to above the sea, or higher than elsewhere in North Britain. Poor, gravelly, clayey and peaty soils prevail, but tile-draining, bones and guano, and the best methods of modern tillage, greatly increased the produce. Indeed, in 1911, no part of Scotland had a more productive soil developed out of such unpromising material. Farm-houses and steadings have much improved, and the best agricultural implements and machines get widespread use. About two-thirds of the population depend entirely on agriculture. Farms are small compared with those in the south- eastern counties. Oats form the predominant crop, wheat has practically gone out of cultivation, but barley has largely increased. The most distinctive industry in 1911 was cattle-feeding. Aberdeenshire fattens a great number of the home-bred crosses for the London and local markets, and imports Irish animals on an extensive scale for the same purpose, while an exceedingly heavy trade in dead meat for London and the south occurs all over the county. Farmers also raise sheep, horses and pigs in large numbers. Since the encyclopedia article was published in 1911, there have been significant changes. Few Irish cattle now come in, the area is still famed for cattle, more commonly continental breeds, with most slaughtered in Scotland, and in particular a good local abattoir capacity. Spring Barley is the predominant crop, and in lowland Winter Wheat, Oil Seed Rape & Potatoes would be more common than oats. There is also a significant area of carrots grown. With no slaughter capacity in Scotland the pig industry is diminishing but still a very important part of the North East economy. Farm sizes are perhaps still relatively smaller than UK but there are some significant agribusinesses in Aberdeenshire. Few farmers raise horses, though horses are more common, kept by private owners & specialists, than in any other area of Scotland. Fisheries In 1911 a large fishing population in villages along the coast engage in the white and herring fishery, fostering the next most important industry to agriculture. Aberdeenshire fishing developed almost exclusively due to the introduction of steam trawlers. In 1911 the total value of the annual catch, of which between a half and a third consists of herrings, amounts to ¬£1,000,000. In 1911 the industry produced both speldings (salted and rock-dried haddocks) and finnans (smoked haddocks). The ports and creeks belong to the fishery districts of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen, the last of which includes also three Kincardineshire ports. The herring season for Aberdeen, Peterhead and Fraserburgh lasts from June to September, at which time the ports become crowded with boats from other Scottish districts. Valuable salmon-fishings exist ‚Äì rod, net and stake-net ‚Äì on the Dee, Don, Ythan and Ugie. In 1911 the average annual despatch of salmon from Aberdeenshire comprises about . Other industries Manufactures mainly cluster in or near the city of Aberdeen, but throughout the rural districts one finds much milling of corn, brick and tile making, smith-work, brewing and distilling, cart and farm-implement making, casting and drying of peat, and timber-felling, especially on Deeside and Donside, for pit-props, railway sleepers, laths and barrel staves. A number of paper-making establishments operate, most of them on the Don near Aberdeen. In 1911 the chief mineral wealth comes from the noted durable granite, quarried at Aberdeen, Kemnay, Peterhead and elsewhere including for causewaying stones. Sandstone and other rocks are also quarried at different parts. The shire imports mostly coal, lime, timber, iron, slate, raw materials for the textile manufactures, wheat, cattle-feeding stuffs, bones, guano, sugar, alcoholic liquors, fruits. The exports include granite (rough-dressed and polished), flax, woollen and cotton goods, paper, combs, preserved provisions, oats, barley, and live and dead cattle. In last quarter of the 20th Century and into the 21st the North Sea oil industry was to become a large employer and overseas revenue earner. Much of the industry's onshore facilities are based in Aberdeen. Transport Aberdeen railway station On the south Aberdeen city has rail links with Stonehaven, Montrose and Dundee, and to the north-west a line runs to Inverness via Huntly, Keith and Elgin. Branch lines from various points used to run to several smaller towns, e.g. from Aberdeen to Ballater by Deeside, from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh (with a branch at Maud for Peterhead and at Ellon for Cruden Bay and Boddam), from Kintore to Alford, and from Inverurie to Old Meldrum and also to Macduff. These lines all closed, largely as a result of the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, they now serve as local pathways or bicycle tracks. By sea Aberdeenshire has regular communication with the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands. The highest of the macadamized roads crossing the eastern Grampians rises to a point above sea-level. Over the 20th Century road and air communications have improved. Aberdeen Airport is an international airport, located at Dyce, a suburb of Aberdeen, approximately north-west of Aberdeen city centre. A total of nearly 3.5 million passengers used the airport in 2015, a fall of 6.8% compared with 2014.  Population and government  In 1801 the population numbered 284,036 and in 1901 304,439 (of whom 159,603 were females), or 154 persons to the square mile (59/km2). In 1901 Aberdeenshire had 8 persons who spoke Gaelic only, and 1333 who spoke Gaelic and English. The chief towns include Aberdeen (population in 1901, 153,503), Bucksburn (2231), Fraserburgh (9105), Huntly (4136), Inverurie (3624), Peterhead (11,794), Turriff (2273). The county total was 137, 962 in 1971. https://www.geni.com/projects/Aberdeenshire-Main-Page/14403 In 1911 the Supreme Court of Justiciary sat in Aberdeen to try cases from the counties of Aberdeen, Banff and Kincardine. The three counties are under a sheriff, and two sheriffs-substitute reside in Aberdeen, and also sat at Fraserburgh, Huntly, Peterhead and Turriff. The sheriff courts occurred in Aberdeen and Peterhead. The higher branches of education have always been thoroughly taught in the schools throughout the shire, and pupils have long been in the habit of going directly from the schools to the university. According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia, Aberdeenshire people have a quick, sharp, rather angry accent. The local Scots dialect, affectionately known as the Doric, appears broad, and rich in diminutives, and is noted for the use of in bane and stane and muin but before and in guid and cuit etc., the realisation of wh, for medial th etc. As recently as 1830 Gaelic provided the fireside language of almost every family in Braemar, but by the start of the 20th century was little used.  History  The country later forming the shires of Aberdeen and Banff once served as home to the northern Picts, whom Ptolemy called Taixall, dubbing the territory Taixalon. Their town of Devana, once supposed to be the modern Aberdeen, has been identified by John Stuart with a site in the parish of Peterculter, where there are remains of an ancient camp at Normandykes, and by William Forbes Skene with a station on Loch Davan, west of Aboyne. Roman Camps have also been discovered on the upper Ythan and Deveron, but evidence of effective Roman occupation is still to seek. Traces of the native inhabitants, however, occur much more frequently. Weems or earth-houses occur fairly commonly in the west. Relics of crannogs or lake-dwellings exist at Loch Kinord, five miles (8 km) northeast of Ballater, at Loch Goul in the parish of New Machar and elsewhere. Duns or forts occur on hills at Dunecht, where the dun encloses an area of two acres (8,000 m2), Barra near Old Meldrum, Tap o' Noth, Dunnideer near Insch and other places. Monoliths, standing stones and \\"druidical\\" circles of the pagan period abound, as do many examples of the sculptured stones of the early Christian epoch. Efforts to convert the Picts started with Teman in the 5th century, and continued with Columba (who founded a monastery at Old Deer), Drostan, Maluog, and Machar, lasting results emerged only slowly. Indeed, dissensions within the Columban church and the expulsion of the clergy from Pictland by the Pictish king Nectan in the 8th century undid most of the progress that missionaries had made. The Vikings and Danes periodically raided the coast, but after Macbeth ascended the throne of Scotland in 1040, the Orkney men, under the guidance of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, refrained from further trouble in the north-east. Macbeth was afterwards slain at Lumphanan (1057), a cairn on Perkhill marking the spot. The influence of the Norman conquest of England made itself felt even in Aberdeenshire. Along with numerous Anglo-Saxon exiles, there also settled in the country Flemings who introduced various industries, Saxons who brought farming, and Scandinavians who taught nautical skill. The Celts revolted more than once, but Malcolm Canmore and his successors crushed them and confiscated their lands. In the reign of Alexander I (ruled 1107‚Äì1124) mention first appears of Aberdeen (originally called Abordon and, in the Norse sagas, Apardion), which received its charter from William the Lion in 1179, by which date its burgesses had already combined with those of Banff, Elgin, Inverness and other trans-Grampian communities to form a free Hanse, under which they enjoyed exceptional trading privileges. By this time, too, the Church had extended its organisation, establishing the bishopric of Aberdeen in 1150. In the 12th and 13th centuries some of the great Aberdeenshire families arose, including the earl of Mar (c. 1122), the Leslies, Freskins (ancestors of the dukes of Sutherland), Durwards, Bysets, Comyns and Cheynes; significantly, in most cases their founders had immigrated to the district. The Celtic thanes and their retainers slowly fused with the settlers. They declined to take advantage of the disturbed condition of the country during the wars of the Scots independence, and made common cause with the bulk of the nation. Though John Comyn (d. 1300?), one of the competitors for the throne, had considerable interests in the shire, his claim received locally little support. In 1296 Edward I made a triumphal march to the north to terrorise the more turbulent nobles. Next year William Wallace surprised the English garrison in Aberdeen, but failed to capture the castle. In 1303 Edward again visited the county, halting at the Castle of Kildrummy, then in the possession of Robert Bruce, who shortly afterwards became the acknowledged leader of the Scots and made Aberdeen his headquarters for several months. Despite the seizure of Kildrummy Castle by the English in 1306, Bruce's prospects brightened from 1308, when he defeated John Comyn, earl of Buchan (died 1313?), at Inverurie. For a hundred years after Robert Bruce's death (1329) intermittent anarchy occurred in the shire. The English burned Aberdeen itself in 1336, and the re-settlement of the districts of Buchan and Strathbogie occasioned constant quarrels on the part of the dispossessed. Moreover, the crown had embroiled itself with some of the Highland chieftains, whose independence it sought to abolish. This policy culminated in the invasion of Aberdeenshire by Donald, Lord of the Isles, who, however, suffered defeat at Harlaw, near Inverurie, at the hands of the Earl of Mar in 1411. In the 15th century two further leading county families emerged: Sir Alexander Forbes becoming Lord Forbes about 1442, and Sir Alexander Seton, Lord Gordon in 1437 and Earl of Huntly in 1445. Bitter feuds raged between these families for a long period, but the Gordons reached the height of their power in the first half of the 16th century, when their domains, already vast, were enhanced by the acquisition, through marriage, of the Earldom of Sutherland (1514). Meanwhile, commerce with the Low Countries, Poland and the Baltic had grown apace, Campvere (Veere in Dutch), near Flushing (Vlissingen) in the Netherlands, becoming the emporium of the Scottish traders, while education was fostered by the foundation of King's College, Aberdeen in 1497 (Marischal College followed a century later). At the Reformation so little intuition had the clergy of the drift of opinion that at the very time that religious structures were being despoiled in the south, the building and decoration of churches went on in the shire. Protestantism came in without much tumult, though rioting took place in Aberdeen and St. Machar's Cathedral in the city suffered damage. The Earl of Huntly offered some resistance, on behalf of the Catholics, to the influence of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, who was regent during the reign of James VI, but was defeated and killed at Corrichie on the Hill of Fare in 1562. As years passed it became apparent that Presbyterianism gained less generally support than Episcopacy, of which system Aberdeenshire remained for generations the stronghold in Scotland. Another crisis in ecclesiastical affairs arose in 1638, when the authorities ordered subscription to the National Covenant. Aberdeenshire responded so grudgingly to this demand that James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose visited the shire in the following year to enforce acceptance. The Cavaliers, not being disposed to yield, dispersed an armed gathering of Covenanters in the affair called the Trot of Turriff (1639), shedding the first blood of the civil war. The Covenanters obtained the upper hand in a few weeks, when Montrose appeared at the Bridge of Dee and compelled the surrender of Aberdeen, which had no choice but to cast in its lot with the victors. Montrose, however, soon changed sides, and after defeating the Covenanters under Lord Balfour of Burleigh (1644), delivered the city to rapine. He worsted the Covenanters again after a stiff fight on 2 July 1645, at Alford, a village in the beautiful Howe of Alford. Peace was temporarily restored on the \\"engagement\\" of the Scots commissioners to assist Charles I. Aberdeen welcomed Charles II on his return from the Netherlands in 1650, but in little more than a year General George Monck entered the city at the head of the Cromwellian regiments. The English garrison remained till 1659, but the following year Aberdeenshire effusively hailed the Restoration, and prelacy once more went into the ascendant. Most of the Presbyterians conformed, but the Quakers, more numerous in the shire and the adjoining county of Kincardineshire than anywhere else in Scotland, suffered systematic persecution. After the Glorious Revolution (1688) episcopacy passed under a cloud, but the clergy, yielding to force majeure, gradually accepted the inevitable, hoping, as long as Queen Anne lived, that prelacy might yet become the national form of Church government. Her death dissipated these dreams, and as George I, her successor, was antipathetic to the clergy, it happened that Jacobitism and episcopalianism came to be regarded in the shire as identical, though the non- jurors as a body never countenanced rebellion. On 6 September 1715 the Earl of Mar raised the standard of revolt in Braemar; a fortnight later James Francis Edward Stuart was proclaimed at Aberdeen cross; the Pretender landed at Peterhead on 22 December, and in February 1716 he was back again in France. The collapse of the first rising ruined many of the lairds, and when the second rebellion occurred thirty years afterwards the county in the main remained apathetic, though the insurgents held Aberdeen for five months, and Lord Lewis Gordon won a trifling victory for Prince Charles Edward Stuart at Inverurie (23 December 1745). The Duke of Cumberland relieved Aberdeen at the end of February 1746, and by April the Young Pretender had become a fugitive.

Sameera held a doctorate in atomic radiation. She hoped her work would one day lead to affordable medical treatments and the peaceful use of atomic energy. She organized the Atomic Energy for Peace Conference and sponsored a call for setting an international conference under the banner \\"Atoms for Peace.\\" She was the first woman to work at Cairo University.  Youth and college  Moussa was born in Egypt in Gharbia Governorate in 1917. Her mother died from cancer, and her father was a famous political activist that moved with his daughter to Cairo and invested his money in a small hotel in the El-Hussein region. At the insistence of her father, Moussa attended Kaser El-Shok primary school, one of the oldest schools in Cairo. After she completed her primary education, she joined the Banat El-Ashraf school, which was built and managed by her father. Despite the fact that Moussa got high grades in her secondary education, and could have gotten into engineering, she insisted on joining the Faculty of Sciences at Cairo University. In 1939, Moussa obtained a BSc in radiology with first class honors after researching the effects of X-ray radiation on various materials. Dr. Moustafa Mousharafa, the first dean of the faculty, believed in his student enough to help her become a remarkable lecturer at the faculty. Afterwards, she became the first assistant professor at the same faculty and the first woman to hold a university post, being the first to obtain a PhD in atomic radiation.  Nuclear research  Moussa believed in Atoms for Peace. She was known to say \\"My wish is for nuclear treatment of cancer to be as available and as cheap as Aspirin\\". She worked hard for this purpose and throughout her intensive research, she came up with a historic equation that would help break the atoms of cheap metals such as copper, paving the way for a cheap nuclear bomb. Moussa organized the Atomic Energy for Peace Conference and sponsored a call for setting an international conference under the banner \\"Atom for Peace\\", where many prominent scientists were invited. The conference made a number of recommendations for setting up a committee to protect against nuclear hazards, for which she strongly advocated. Moussa also volunteered to help treat cancer patients at various hospitals especially since her mother went through a fierce battle against this disease.  Visits to the United States  Moussa received a scholarship from the Fulbright Atomic in order to be acquainted with the modern research facilities at California University. In recognition of her pioneering nuclear research, she was given permission to visit the secret US atomic facilities. The visit raised vehement debate in United States academic and scientific circles since she was the first non- white person to be granted that privilege. She turned down several offers that required her to live in the United States and to be granted the American citizenship saying \\"Egypt, my dear homeland, is waiting for me\\".  Authored Works  Dr. Sameera Moussa was the first assistant professor at the school of Sciences at Cairo University and more impressively the first woman at the university to obtain a university post due to her groundbreaking PhD in atomic radiation from the 1940s. Inspired by the contribution of earlier Muslim scientists, including her teacher, Dr. Moustafa Mashrafa, Sameers began writing an article on the work done by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in founding algebra. She has also authored multiple articles that communicate the theory behind nuclear energy, its impact, and safety of their use in simpler terms. She also discusses the history of the atom and its structure, and dangers of nuclear fission technology. As well as, the properties of radiation and their biological effects.  Death  On August 5, 1952 after her first visit to America she intended to return home, but she was invited on a trip. On the way, the car fell from a height of 40 feet, which killed her immediately. It has been alleged that the Israeli Mossad was behind Moussa's murder aided by a Jewish-Egyptian actress, Raqya Ibrahim (Rachael Abraham).\\"Raqia Ibrahim: Egyptian Jewish Actress Recruited by Israel to Prevent Egypt Owning Nuclear Bomb\\" Egypt Independent (1 December 2014).  Awards and honors  In recognition to her efforts, she was granted many awards. Among them were: * 1953, when she was honored by the Egyptian Army. * 1981, when she was awarded the Order of Science and Arts, First Class, by then-President Anwar Sadat. * A laboratory at the Faculty of Science and a school in her village were named after her. * The Egyptian TV transmitted a serial titled The Immortal dramatizing her biography. * In 1998, while celebrating the Egyptian Woman Day, it was decided to establish a cultural solace in her birthplace bearing her name. * A book was published covering her life and scientific contributions.

Her first task is protecting aircraft carriers, capital ships or civilian ships from supersonic missile attacks; her complement of medium-range anti-air missiles allows her to support the defences of another ship under attack and avoid their saturation. She is also capable of monitoring and controlling operations carried out from the sea by friendly aircraft. Forbin is the sixth vessel of the French Navy named after the 17th century admiral Claude Forbin- Gardanne.  Operations= Building and fitting out  Construction of Forbin began in Lorient on 8 April 2002. The hull was built in 14 sections by a variety of subcontractors of DCN, including several companies from Saint- Nazaire. Each section was high, and long. Forbin was laid down on 16 January 2004; the hull sections were transferred from Saint-Nazaire to Lorient on a barge tugged by Alcyon and assembled there from February 2004 to January 2005, finishing with the bow. The engines were delivered by FiatAvio in September. Forbin was launched on 10 March 2005, after part of the Scorff river was dredged to make it deep enough for her draught. She was towed out of her building dock by four tugboats at 16:15, taking advantage of the tide. On 28 October, Forbin entered dry dock and underwater equipment was installed, notably the sonar, propellers and rudders. Trials were held throughout 2006. Engine tests started on 10 May, and she sailed for sea trials on 29 June. Tuning of the combat management systems was particularly problematic, setting the completion of the ship off-schedule enough for her commissioning to be delayed by several months. In late January 2007, Forbin underwent new extensive trials at sea, successfully testing her combat systems in exercises against Super √âtendard and Atlantique 2 aircraft. The PAAMS was tested in late May at the Centre d'Essais des Landes. From 12 to 17, Forbin sailed to Toulon, her new home port, where her combat, detection and weapon systems were further finetuned. Forbin fired an Aster 30 at the test range of the DGA on 25 November.  First cruise  Forbin left Toulon on 3 March 2009 for her first long cruise, visiting Morocco, the United States and Canada. She carried a Panther from Squadron 36F of the A√©ronavale to validate her air installations. Forbin sailed to Casablanca, and then to Rio de Janeiro. She left Brazil on 30 March, bound for Martinique, where she arrived on 21 April. and sailed on to Norfolk, Virginia and New York, arriving on 24 April. During the transit, she carried out exercises with . A visit to Halifax was cancelled. Forbin was back to France in May, where she took part in the naval parade of 8 May off Sainte-Maxime. On 25 May, she was at Abu Dhabi. In June, Forbin operated with the carrier group, supporting \\"Operation Enduring Freedom\\" and maritime security operations. Second cruise The frigate Forbin was part of the French naval task group led by the aircraft carrier that departed Toulon on 30 October 2010 for a four-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Indian Ocean. and Persian Gulf. The task group commander, Rear Admiral Jean-Louis Kerignard, defined force's mission as follows: :The force would help allied navies fight piracy off the coast of Somalia and send jets to support NATO in the skies above Afghanistan. Once on station, the Charles de Gaulle carrier task group joined two U.S. Navy carrier strike groups led by the aircraft carriers and operating in the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, between 7‚Äì14 January 2011, the French carrier task group led by Charles de Gaulle participated with bilateral naval exercise, code named Varuna 10, with the Indian Navy. Indian naval units participating in Varuna 10 included the , the s and ; and the diesel-electric submarine . Varuna 10 was a two-phase naval exercise, with the harbor phase taking place between 7‚Äì11 January and the sea phase between 11‚Äì14 January in the Arabian Sea.

Billing is a performing arts term used in referring to the order and other aspects of how credits are presented for plays, films, television, or other creative works. Information given in billing usually consists of the companies, actors, directors, producers, and other crew members. Films=History From the beginning of motion pictures in the 1900s to the early 1920s, the moguls that owned or managed big film studios did not want to bill the actors appearing in their films because they did not want to recreate the star system that was prevalent on Broadway at that time. They also feared that, once actors were billed on film, they would be more popular and would seek large salaries. Actors themselves did not want to reveal their film careers to their stage counterparts via billing on film, because at that time working in the movies was unacceptable to stage actors. As late as the 1910s, stars as famous as Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin were not known by name to moviegoers. According to Mary Pickford's biography Doug and Mary,Doug & Mary: A biography of Douglas Fairbanks & Mary Pickford, by Gary Carey, E.P. Dutton, 1977, p. 21 she was referred to by the public as \\"the Biograph girl\\" in all of her films before 1905. Before Mary Pickford, the public used to call Florence Lawrence the \\"Biograph girl\\". In 1910, Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by Carl Laemmle when he started the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP). Laemmle wanted Lawrence to be his star attraction, so he offered her more money (US$250 per week ()) and marquee billing, something Biograph did not allow. She signed on; with the release of her first IMP film, The Broken Oath (1910), she became the first film star to receive billing on the credits of her film. From then on, actors received billing on film. Also originating during that time was the system of billing above and below the title, to delineate the status of the players. Big stars such as Pickford, Fairbanks, and Chaplin were billed above the title, while lesser stars and supporting players were billed below the title. During the era of the studio system, on-screen billing was presented at the beginning of a film; only a restatement of the cast and possibly additional players appeared at the end, because the studios had actors under contract and could decide billing. The studios still followed the billing system of the silent era. After the studio system's collapse in the 1950s, actors and their agents fought for billing on a film-by-film basis. This, combined with changes in union contracts and copyright laws, led to more actors and crew members being included in the credits sequence, expanding its size significantly. As a result, since the late 1960s, a significant amount of the billing is reserved for the closing credits of the film, which generally includes a recap of the billing shown at the beginning. In addition, more stars began to demand top billing. Billing demands even extended to publicity materials, down to the height of the letters and the position of names. By the 1990s, some films had moved all billing to the film's end, with the exception of company logos and the title. Although popularised by the Star Wars series (see below) and used sporadically in films such as The Godfather (1972) and Ghostbusters (1984), this \\"title-only\\" billing became an established form for summer blockbusters in 1989, with Ghostbusters II (1989), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), and The Abyss (1989) following the practice.Keyword 'no opening credits' from IMDb Occasionally, even the title is left to the end, such as in The Passion of the Christ (2004), Avatar (2009), Inception (2010), and the Dark Knight trilogy. Billing order The order in which credits are billed generally signify their importance. While there are numerous variations, most opening credits use some variation of the following basic order. In the absence of opening credits, these roles will often be credited in reverse order at the beginning of the closing credits. * Name of the film studio(s) * Production company(ies) * Possessory credits * Above-title billed actor(s) * Film title * Main cast * Last billed actor(s) * Casting director(s) * Composer(s) * Visual effects supervisor(s) * Costume designer(s) * Film editor(s) * Production designer(s) * Director(s) of Photography * Producer(s) and Executive Producer(s) * Screenwriter(s) * Director(s)  Studio vs. production company  The name of the studio that is normally credited is the one that distributed the film. However, a studio may not necessarily be the party that produced it. Instead, a separate production company may have actually made the film or financed a substantial part of the film.  Possessory credits  Depending on their standing, the director may be granted an extra, prominent credit before the film's title (as in \\"A Ridley Scott Film\\"); this practice began with directors such as Otto Preminger, David Lean, and John Frankenheimer in the mid-1960s. Sometimes the producer or writer may also get a possessory credit. Up until the establishment of the director's possessive credit, in the early 1970s, some directors were so highly regarded that they received what seems to be a producer's credit, even if they did not produce the film. Victor Fleming was one such director: his films usually featured the credit \\"A Victor Fleming Production\\", even when someone else produced the film. James Whale was similarly credited.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001843/ Director Kevin Smith refuses to use a possessory credit, such as \\"A Kevin Smith Film\\", feeling that a movie is made by everyone involved and not the product of just the director.  Top and above-title billing  The actors whose names appear first are said to have \\"top billing\\". They usually play the principal characters in the film and have the most screen time. Frequently, top-billed actors are also named in advertising material such as trailers, posters, billboards, and TV spots. The two or three top-billed actors in a movie will usually be announced prior to the title of the movie; this is referred to as \\"above-title billing\\". For an actor to receive it, he/she will generally have to be well-established, with box-office drawing power. Those introduced afterward are generally considered to be the supporting cast. Well-known actors may be given top billing for publicity or contractual purposes if juvenile, lesser-known, or first-time performers appear in a larger role: e.g., Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were both credited before the title in Superman (1978), while Christopher Reeve, the then-unknown actor who played the titular character and protagonist, was not, even though Brando only appears in the introduction while Hackman was the main antagonist. Similarly in Apocalypse Now, Brando was billed first though he only appears at the end as the film's chief antagonist, while Robert Duvall was billed second despite a brief supporting role that earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, and Martin Sheen who portrayed the main character was billed third. It used to be common practice to give top billing based on a person's level of fame, regardless of the significance of their role in the film. For example, Marlon Brando received top billing in The Godfather (although he had less on-screen time than Al Pacino's character; Pacino was displeased that he was only nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar while Brando received the Oscar nod for Best Actor in a Leading Role), Apocalypse Now (see above), and Superman (also see above). Maximilian Schell was billed fifth in Judgment at Nuremberg after Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, and Marlene Dietrich, yet Schell went on to win the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In recent decades, however, the practice of giving top billing to a star actor has largely been discontinued especially if they only play a bit part; some major actors may have a cameo where they are only noted within the other cast during the end credits. If an unfamiliar actor has the lead role, he may be listed last in the list of principal supporting actors, his name prefixed with \\"and introducing\\" (as Peter O'Toole was in Lawrence of Arabia) However \\"and introducing\\" is now mostly used in feature films by a young actor (usually a child) who appears for the first time in a motion picture. Sometimes, he may not receive special billing even if his role is crucial. For example, the then-unknown William Warfield, who played Joe and sang \\"Ol' Man River\\" in the 1951 film version of Show Boat, received tenth billing as if he were merely a bit player, while Paul Robeson, an established star who played the same role in the 1936 film version of the musical, received fourth billing in the 1936 film. If more than one name appears at the same time or of a similar size, then those actors are said to have \\"equal billing\\", with their importance decreasing from left to right. However, an instance of \\"equal importance\\" is The Towering Inferno (1974) starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. The two names appear simultaneously with Newman's on the right side of the screen and raised slightly higher than McQueen's, to indicate the comparable status of both actors' characters (this also features on the advertising poster). A similar situation occurred in 2002 with Chicago, where Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones received ‚Äústacked billing‚Äù on the film‚Äôs poster, where a person reading from left to right would read Zeta-Jones‚Äô name first and a person reading from top to bottom would read Zellweger‚Äôs name first. If a film has an ensemble cast with no clear lead role, it is traditional to bill the participants alphabetically or in the order of their on-screen appearance. An example of the former is A Bridge Too Far (1977), which featured 14 roles played by established stars, any one of whom would have ordinarily received top billing as an individual. The cast of the Harry Potter films includes many recognized stars in supporting roles who are billed alphabetically, but after the three principals who were initially child actors. In the case of the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet, there were many famous actors playing supporting or bit roles, and these actors were given prominent billing in the posters along with the film's actual stars: Branagh, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, and Kate Winslet. In the actual film's credits, they (along with the other actors in the film) were listed in alphabetical order and in the same size typeface. If an actor is not an established star, he or she may not receive above-the-title billing, or even \\"star\\" billing; they may just be listed at the head of the cast. This is the way that all of the actors were listed in the opening credits to The Wizard of Oz; Judy Garland, although listed first, was given equal billing to all the others, with the cast list reading \\"with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley\\", etc. F. Murray Abraham, a supporting actor at the time of Amadeus, did not receive special star billing although he played the lead role of Antonio Salieri; his onscreen credit reads \\"with F. Murray Abraham\\", although his name does appear first in the cast. In some cases, the position of a name in the credits roll can become a sticking point for both cast and crew. Such was the case on the sixties TV sitcom Gilligan's Island, where two of the stars were only mentioned by name in the closing credits. In fact, the characters of The Professor (Russell Johnson) and Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) were the only ones whose mention in the opening theme song was abbreviated simply as \\"the rest\\" in the show's first season. Bob Denver, who played Gilligan, was so upset with this treatment that he reportedly told the producers that since his contract stipulated that his name could appear anywhere in the credits that he wished, he wanted to be moved to the end credits with his co-stars. From the show's second season, the studio capitulated, and moved Denver's co-stars to the opening credits of the show, and also changed the theme song's lyrics to include \\"The Professor and Mary Ann\\" instead of saying \\"and the rest\\". =Competitive top billing= Sometimes actors can become highly competitive over the order of billing. For example: Spencer Tracy was originally cast to play the lead opposite Humphrey Bogart in The Desperate Hours (1955) but when neither actor would relinquish top billing, Tracy withdrew and was replaced by Fredric March, who took second billing to Bogart. Bogart's role in the film had earlier been played on Broadway by Paul Newman but the young actor was not considered for the movie version since Newman, viewed by studios at the time as mainly a stage and television actor only beginning his movie career, was in no position to compete with Bogart. Spencer Tracy would also later back out of co-starring in the 1965 film The Cincinnati Kid when he learned he would have to take second billing behind the film's star Steve McQueen. The role Tracy had been cast in went instead to Edward G. Robinson, whom McQueen had idolized from childhood. Whenever it was pointed out to Spencer Tracy that he routinely took top billing in his films with Katharine Hepburn, he responded, \\"It's a movie, not a lifeboat.\\" Clark Gable had a top billing clause written into his MGM contract and made three major films in the 1930s with Spencer Tracy in supporting roles (San Francisco, Test Pilot, and Boom Town), but when Tracy renegotiated his contract during World War II, he had a similar clause included in his own contract, effectively ending the hugely popular Gable- Tracy team. In the opening credits of The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Alec Guinness, who is generally regarded as the main character in the film, receives third billing, after William Holden (who demanded top billing) and Jack Hawkins (who does not even appear until halfway through the picture). In the closing credits, Guinness is billed second with Hawkins third. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) For The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), James Stewart was given top billing over John Wayne in the movie's posters and the previews (trailers) shown in cinemas and on television prior to the film's release, but in the film itself, Wayne is accorded top billing. Their names are displayed on pictures of signposts, one after the other, with Wayne's name shown first with his sign mounted slightly higher on its post than Stewart's. Director John Ford remarked in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich that he made it apparent to the audience that Vera Miles' character had never entirely recovered from an abortive romance with Wayne's gunslinging rancher because \\"I wanted Wayne to be the lead.\\"Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors by Peter Bogdanovich Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford used precisely the same billing formula for All the President's Men (1976), with Redford receiving top billing in posters and trailers while Hoffman was billed over Redford in the film itself. As both Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis wanted top billing for Boeing Boeing (1965), their animated names appeared in a spinning, circular fashion in front of an airplane engine's rotating nacelle.Private Screenings: Tony Curtis. Turner Classic Movies, 19 Jan 1999. For the trailer, the circular animation of the two names was repeated and neither name was spoken aloud. For the posters, the names made an X, Lewis' going up from the bottom left and Curtis' going down from the upper left. For the film The Towering Inferno (1974), Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and William Holden all tried to obtain top billing. Holden was refused as his diminished star power was no longer considered to be in the league of McQueen's and Newman's. To provide dual top billing and mollify McQueen, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen at the lower left and Newman at the upper right. Thus, each actor appeared to have top billing depending on whether the poster was read from left to right or top to bottom.The Towering Inferno Masterprint at Art.com Technically, McQueen has top billing and is mentioned first in the film's trailers; however, at the end of the movie, as the cast's names roll from the bottom of the screen, Newman's name is fully visible first, giving him top billing in the closing credits. This was the first time that this type of \\"staggered but equal\\" billing had been used for a movie, although the same thing had been discussed for the same two actors five years earlier when McQueen was going to play the Sundance Kid in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). McQueen ultimately passed on the part and was replaced by Robert Redford, who did not enjoy McQueen's status and took second billing to Newman. Today, it has become understood that whoever's name appears to the left has top billing, but this was by no means the case when The Towering Inferno was produced. This same approach has often been used subsequently, including 2008's Righteous Kill starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.http://www.impawards.com/2008/righteous_kill.html In The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), F. Murray Abraham asked for above-title billing. This was rejected as too many other stars were getting it (Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith). Thus, Abraham asked for his name to be completely removed, even from the closing credits. That same year, Ra√∫l Juli√° requested above the title billing alongside Robert Redford and Lena Olin for the drama Havana. When the producers rejected this, he decided to go uncredited. Eleven years later, Don Cheadle did exactly the same thing when his name wasn't allowed to appear above the title in Ocean's Eleven (2001), presumably because his name would have alphabetically preceded George Clooney's and, unlike with the later sequels, the cast above the title was presented alphabetically (Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garc√≠a, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts). Cheadle removed his name from the credits.http://www.impawards.com/2001/oceans_eleven_ver2.html The producers apparently wanted Clooney, not Cheadle, to be the first name a casual viewer of the advertising would see. In Batman (1989), Jack Nicholson demanded top billing and a share of the film's earnings (including associated merchandise), even though Michael Keaton played the titular character while Nicholson's Joker was the antagonist. In the film Miami Vice (2006), Colin Farrell originally received top billing. However, after Jamie Foxx won an Academy Award he demanded top billing and received it despite his role actually being much smaller than Farrell's. Foxx's name appears first in the opening credits, while Farrell still receives top billing in the closing credits. In a commercial for Michael and Michael Have Issues (2009), the aforementioned characters mock-argue over who gets top billing for their show. Last billing An actor may receive \\"last billing\\", which usually designates a smaller role played by a famous name. They are usually credited after the rest of the lead cast, prefixed with \\"and\\" (or also \\"with\\" if there is more than one, as Samuel L. Jackson was in the latter two Star Wars prequels and several Marvel Cinematic Universe films). In some cases, the name is followed by \\"as\\" and then the name of the character (sometimes called an \\"and-as\\" credit). This is not the case if that character is unseen for most of the movie (see Ernst Stavro Blofeld). An early last billing credit in a film's opening simply listed a question mark (?) as portraying the monster in the 1931 classic Frankenstein, which still lists it that way today, although the reissued prints seen today add actor Boris Karloff to the end credit listings, as the film made him a huge star such that the credits of the film's first sequel The Bride of Frankenstein credits him only by his last name. One of the first \\"and-as\\" credits was afforded Spencer Tracy (as Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle) in the 1944 World War II film Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, since another top box office star of the time, Van Johnson, had top billing and Tracy was too big a star to receive second billing. In all the posters and the screen credits, Tracy's name is displayed in larger letters than Johnson's. Some films have both an \\"and-as\\" credit and a separate last billing credit, such as the Irwin Allen 1978 disaster film The Swarm, the opening credits of which, after listing an already large cast of stars, concludes with \\"Fred MacMurray as Clarence ... and Henry Fonda\\". Unbilled appearances An actor may go uncredited, and not be listed in either or both of the opening and closing credits. Reasons for this may vary. Some examples include: * As Gary Oldman appeared under heavy make-up in Hannibal, he requested that his name be completely removed from the billing and credits in order to \\"do it anonymously\\".Interview with Gary Oldman from IGN However, Nathan Murray is still credited as \\"Mr. Oldman's assistant\\" and Oldman's name was added to the end credits upon the film's home video release. * Even though Gene Hackman had a prominent role in The Firm he chose not to receive any billing credit because Tom Cruise was afforded sole, above the title, top billing with the letters of his name equal to that of the film title. * For suspense purposes, Kevin Spacey, in Seven, requested not to be credited in the opening titles or in any advertising for the film.Seven Trivia ‚Äì IMDb His name appears in the closing credits. * In the opening of 1931's Frankenstein, the credit for \\"The Monster\\" is a question mark. Boris Karloff is named in the closing credits. * Ashton Kutcher appears as Hank, in the 2003 family comedy Cheaper by the Dozen and is uncredited although he is one of the film's main characters. * In the 1974 film Earthquake, Walter Matthau agreed to provide a cameo performance without compensation on the condition that he not be credited under his real name; he was credited under a fictitious name of his choosing, \\"Walter Matuschanskayasky\\". * Because he played the part without pay, Bruce Willis is not credited for his prominent role in the portion of Four Rooms directed by Quentin Tarantino. * Owen Wilson does not receive credit for his \\"Jedidiah\\" character in Night at the Museum, though he receives credit in the sequel, Battle of the Smithsonian. * John Wayne was billed as \\"Michael Morris\\" in two cameo television appearances directed by John Ford, an episode of Wagon Train and an anthology installment called Flashing Spikes starring James Stewart. Wayne's real name was Marion Michael Morrison. * For his cameo appearances in Cabin Boy and Beavis and Butt-head Do America, David Letterman was billed as \\"Earl Hofert\\". * In Interstellar, Matt Damon's casting was kept secret during production, and he is not credited in the film. This was a deliberate decision by the director Chris Nolan, as he deliberately uses the audience's familiarity with Matt Damon as a 'good guy' actor to hide his character's true intentions. Other unbilled roles feature famous actors or actresses who pop up in a movie as a face in a crowd, a man on a bench, or other 'background' characters, who are given screen time for a brief, but recognizable, moment, such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope momentarily appearing in a circus audience during The Greatest Show on Earth. They can be recognized, but sometimes are not credited for financial reasons ‚Äì if they receive credit, they would be due payment commensurate with their fame. An intriguing example of this remains James Cagney being clearly glimpsed during the opening scenes of MGM's Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable. Cagney was contracted to Warner Bros. at the time and was arguably their biggest star but appears briefly as an unbilled and presumably unpaid extra at the beginning of the rival studio's seagoing epic. Screenwriters billing Writing credits for films and TV shows written under the jurisdiction of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) use the WGA screenwriting credit system. For writers who belong to the WGA, the writing credits affect reputation, union membership, and income. Under the rules, the film producer must first submit the proposed writing credits for the project to both the WGA and all the participating writers. If any participating writer objects to the proposed credits, it then enters arbitration, with the WGA being the final arbiter. The WGA rules help dictate whether a screenplay should be classified as \\"original\\" or is instead based on another source. If based on another source, an additional \\"Based on a book/play/other source by\\" is generally required. In the case of a sequel to the film, the credited writers of the original motion picture may be entitled to a \\"Based on characters created by\\" credit. The WGA's rules also outlines when credits can be apportioned separately for the story, and for the screenplay itself when all writers were not equally involved in the creation of both. When the same writers are entitled to both \\"Screenplay by\\" and \\"Story by\\" credit, they will instead by listed under one \\"Written by\\" credit. For writing teams of two, they are credited as one, separated on the credits by an ampersand (\\"X & Y\\"). If each works independently on the script (the most common system), they are separated by an \\"and\\". If more than two persons worked on the screenplay, the credits may read something like \\"screenplay by X & Y and Z and W\\", where X and Y worked as a team, but Z and W worked separately. The WGA system also puts limits on the number of writers: on films, \\"Screenplay by\\", \\"Teleplay by\\", and \\"Written by\\" credit each can list no more than three writers (or writing teams). Director billing The Directors Guild of America (DGA) requires that a film lists only one director, even if more than one director has worked on the film, with few exceptions, such as for directing teams such as the Coen brothers. If the main credits occur at the beginning, then the director's name is last to be shown before the film's narrative starts, as a result of an agreement between the DGA and motion picture producers in 1939. If all billing is shown at the end, the director's name will be displayed first, immediately followed by the writing credits. * In 1980, George Lucas resigned from the DGA after it insisted, against his wishes, that Irvin Kershner, the director of The Empire Strikes Back, be credited at the beginning of the film because the company name Lucasfilm was there; it had previously allowed the original Star Wars (1977), which had a similar opening sequence, to go unchallenged because the writer- director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name Lucasfilm Ltd. * Ben- Hur is one of the few MGM films in which the director receives very prominent billing in the posters advertising the movie ‚Äì the posters state \\"William Wyler's Production of\\", although the same credit does not appear in the actual on-screen credits.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Vqh-dOq04 A similar example is David Lean, whose Doctor Zhivago and Ryan's Daughter both carry the credit \\"David Lean's Film of\\" (followed by the title). Stanley Kubrick received prominent title billing from Dr. Strangelove (1964) onwards, and from A Clockwork Orange (1971) he generally received main billing, with the actors only listed in the billing block. Advertising materials for Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut featured the billing \\"CRUISE / KIDMAN / KUBRICK\\". * Filmmaker and playwright Tyler Perry always inserts his name into the title of each of his films and television shows. For instance: Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married? or Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. To date, the only film he has not done this with is For Colored Girls, which is an adaptation of the Ntozake Shange play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. * In 2004 Robert Rodriguez quit the DGA because he wanted to credit Frank Miller as \\"co-director\\" on the film Sin City. Billing block alt=Poster art. A giant woman clad in a white bikini straddles an elevated, 4-lane highway. She has an angry expression, and she's holding one smoking car in her left hand as if it were a toy. She is reaching down to grab another. There are several car crashes on the highway, and people are fleeing from her as if they were small insects. The \\"billing block\\" is the \\"list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or 'one sheet', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie\\". In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed typeface (one in which the height of characters is several times the width). By convention, the point size of the billing block is 15 to 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo. Typefaces used include Univers 39, Univers 49, and Bee. Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between Hollywood labor unions representing creative talent and the producer or film distributor. The labor union contracts specify minimum requirements for presenting actors, writers and directors.Marich, Robert (2013) Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition (2013), SIU Press, p. 18-20 But star talent is free to individually negotiate larger name presentations, such as when a star actor or director has his or her name above a movie‚Äôs title. The union contracts also cover billing blocks in trailers, outdoor billboards, TV commercials, newspaper advertising and online advertising. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.

The main mission of this type of ship is the escort and protection of a carrier strike group formed around an aircraft carrier, usually the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or one of the aircraft carriers of the US Navy, or an amphibious operation carried out by amphibious helicopter carriers. The ships specialty is air traffic control in a war zone, but it can be employed in a wide variety of missions, such as intelligence- gathering, special forces operations, or in protecting less well-armed vessels. Horizon frigates such as the Chevalier Paul are the most powerful surface combatants that France has ever built. In service since the end of 2011, it bears the visual code D621. Its namesake is Jean-Paul de Saumeur, better known as Chevalier Paul, a French naval officer born in Marseille in 1598.

Chevalier Paul was launched by DCN at Lorient on 12 July 2006. She is a sister-ship to . This ship was approved by the French Navy in December 2008 and is based in the military port of Toulon. He made the first launch of an MM40 Block 3 missile by a French navy ship on 17 March 2010. It made its first long-term crossing from 18 March 2010, which should end in mid-July, and admitted to active service on 10 June 2011, when the ship was engaged three days later in Operation Harmattan, the French contribution to the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On 29 August 2013, Chevalier Paul left the port city of Toulon. Some reports claimed she had been deployed to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the Syrian Civil War, but the navy authorities declined to confirm she was heading for Syria. From 13 to 26 October 2014, the frigate took part in the large international operational exercise Catamaran 2014 that practiced an amphibious assault. In November 2015, a French Navy press release stated that Chevalier Paul was to be part of the task force launching strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. the ship is a component of the Charles de Gaulle Carrier Strike Group, which left Toulon on 13 January for a mission of approximately five months and must be engaged for eight weeks in the gulf. On 18 November 2015, Charles de Gaulle set sail and joined its carrier strike group, of which Chevalier Paul is a member. It also consisted of the , the , the British destroyer , the supply ship Marne and a nuclear attack submarine. In May 2017, it completed its intermediate technical stop which saw the replacement of the two 76 mm turrets named \\"Hercule\\" and \\"Licorne\\".  Weapon systems =Aster missile Chevalier Paul with an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea Aster missiles are the main weapon system of Chevalier Paul. The ship is equipped with 32 Aster 30 missiles and 16 Aster 15 missiles, housed in vertical silos of the Sylver A50 type, located on the foredeck. A main anti- air missile system (PAAMS), combined with an EMPAR multifunction radar operating in C-band, controls launch and target tracking. The first launch of an Aster 30 against a target from sister ship Forbin took place in November 2008 at Toulon. It was the first fire of this machine since a frigate. The previous Aster 30 launches from the sea were carried out from a British barge and the Italian test ship Carabiniere. The missile was fired at an aerial target from the evolving building off the DGA's Le Levant test and launch center . The Aster 30 missiles of the air defense frigate are the second bulwark of protection of the carrier strike group, after the Rafale fighters, and provide 360¬∞ protection at a distance of 100 kilometers against aircraft and 30 kilometers against grazing and maneuvering anti-ship anti-ship missiles in service or in development. The French Navy has shown with the frigate Forbin its capacity to destroy a supersonic missile ( 3,000 km / h ) maneuvering ( SS-N-22, AS-17, BrahMos ) and at an altitude of less than 5 meters above water by shooting down a GQM-163 Coyote. Exocet MM40 Block 3C Chevalier Paul embarks eight sea-sea Exocet missiles installed on the upper deck amidships. The most recent version MM40 Block 3C of the Exocet missile was selected. It can operate at a distance of more than 180 kilometers from its objective. Others Two turrets with OTO-Melara 76 mm cannon fully automated, implemented from the Central Operation, and have a rate of fire of 60 to 120 rounds per minute. Each turret, weighing 5.5 tonnes, is gyrostabilized, in order to be able to maintain its position despite the movements of the building. It has a barrel containing 60 shells which can be refueled in real time by servants recovering the ammunition arriving from the ammunition compartment via an elevator. More than 1,000 shells of different types (land, surface or anti-aircraft fire) are stored, with a maximum range of 13 kilometers against surface targets, and 2 manual guns of 20 mm mod. replaced in 2018 by 3 Narwhal 20 mm automatic cannons.

Two years later, the Navy received ship. 5 May 2009: Horizon class meeting and naval review On 5 May 2009, the four Horizon-class frigates of the French and Italian navies met off La Spezia, Italy. Chevalier Paul remained moored there until 7 May in the evening. On 8 May 2009, on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the Victory of 8 May 1945, the Forbin participated in the naval review which was held off Sainte- Maxime, in the Var. Sixteen buildings are present, including the most recent such as the French ship Mistral (L9013) Nicolas Sarkozy takes place, and also the French ship Tonnerre (L9014). 18 March 2010: long crossing After the icy waters, Chevalier Paul descends to the North Sea and briefly participates in the NATO exercise Brillant Mariner ( 12 to 22 April 2011), which also involves the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and the BPC Mistral. Then the frigate crosses the Atlantic to reach the United States and Canada, before descending south to the Caribbean, stopping over in Mexico and crossing the Panama Canal. She then begins a tour of South America and normally arrives in Rio de Janeiro in June 2011. The Chevalier Paul then crosses the Atlantic to reach Morocco, then finds, in mid-July, the naval base of Toulon.  Awards  On 6 July 2016, following Operation Arromanches 2 in the eastern Mediterranean, the frigate received the Belgian military cross.  Coronavirus pandemic  During the COVID-19 pandemic, on 15 April 2020, the Ministry of Armed Forces reported that, out of the 1,767 tests conducted on the members of the carrier battle group led by , 668 returned positive. The vast majority of these cases were aboard Charles de Gaulle, and the remainder of the cases were aboard Chevalier Paul. On 12 April the French Navy reported that Charles de Gaulle and accompanying air-defense frigate Chevalier Paul had returned to Toulon, while command and replenishment tanker and anti-submarine frigate had returned to Brest. The 200 sailors of Chevalier Paul were subsequently quarantined for two weeks. On 15 April, the Ministry of Armed Forces reported that, out of the 1,767 tests that had been conducted on the members of the carrier battle group so far, 668 had returned positive. The vast majority of these cases were aboard Charles de Gaulle, and the remainder of the cases were reported to be aboard Chevalier Paul. On 17 April, , Central Director of the Military Health Service, reported to the that all 2,300 sailors of the carrier battle group had been tested upon their return to Toulon, and so far, 940 had tested positive while 645 had tested negative. On the same day, Florence Parly, Minister of the Armed Forces, reported to the National Assembly's that 2,010 sailors of the carrier battle group had been tested, with 1,081 tests returning positive so far. In total, 545 sailors had shown symptoms and 24 had been hospitalized at the Saint Anne Army Teaching Hospital, including one admitted to an ICU. On 29 April 2020, the Navy stated that 19 sailors aboard Chevalier Paul had tested positive upon arrival at Toulon. On 11 May 2020, Florence Parly reported to the National Assembly the conclusions of two investigations into the outbreak on board the carrier, stating that the virus had first arrived before a stopover made in Brest, and that although the command and medical team aboard the carrier had \\"excessive confidence\\" in their ability to deal with the virus, the investigations did not consider them at fault. Parly further explained that the introduction of the virus on board the carrier happened sometime between when it left Limassol, Cyprus, on 26 February 2020, and when it arrived at Brest on 13 March. During this time, personnel had been brought on board via air from either Cyprus, Sicily, the Balearic Islands, Spain, or Portugal. The spread of the virus, however, was exacerbated by the stopover at Brest. Social distancing and other measures were taken after the stopover, but they weighed heavily on crew morale, so after enforcing the strict measures for a fortnight, they were relaxed, and a concert on board was authorized for 30 March. Parly also noted that all soldiers aboard Charles de Gaulle have since recovered from the disease except for one sailor, who was still hospitalized after leaving the ICU.

In 1969 he challenged Tony Boyle for the presidency of the international union and was defeated. He asked for a Department of Labor (DOL) investigation, charging a fraudulent election. In addition, Yablonski filed suit against the UMWA on five different charges related to fraud. On New Year's Eve, Yablonski, his wife and 25-year-old daughter were murdered, fatally shot at home by three gunmen found to have been hired on orders of Tony Boyle. A total of seven persons were convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder; two of the assassins were sentenced to death for first-degree murder. DOL completed its investigation, aided by the FBI, and won a suit to overturn the 1969 election by 1972. A new election was held in December of that year and a reform candidate elected, defeating Boyle. Boyle was indicted in 1973 for the three Yablonski murders; he was convicted in 1974 and received three life sentences. The union made important reforms. Early life, marriages and union career Joseph Yablonski, called \\"Jock\\", was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 3, 1910, as the son of Polish immigrants,Richard Jensen, \\"Yablonski, Joseph A. 'Jock,'\\" in Encyclopedia of United States Labor and Working-class History (New York: Taylor and Francis, 2007), 1:1555-6. After attending public schools, Yablonski began working in the mines as a boy, joining his father in this industry. After his father was killed in a mine explosion, Yablonski became active in the United Mine Workers and began to advocate for better working conditions. He was first elected to union office in 1934. In 1940, Yablonski was elected as a representative to the international executive board. In 1958 he was appointed president of UMW District 5.\\"Yablonski of U.M.W. Slain With Wife and Daughter,\\" New York Times, January 6, 1970. As a young man, Yablonski married Ann (n√©e Huffman). Their son Kenneth J. Yablonski was born in 1934. Yablonski married again, to Margaret Rita (n√©e Wasicek), an amateur play wright. They had two children, Joseph \\"Chip\\" (b. 1941) and Charlotte Yablonski, b. 1944. Both sons became labor attorneys, representing their father in his union activities and later in private practices. Charlotte became a social worker in Clarksville, Pennsylvania, where her family lived. She took leave to work in 1969 on her father's campaign for the UMWA presidency. Yablonski clashed with Tony Boyle, who was elected president of the UMW in 1963, over how the union should be run. He believed that Boyle did not adequately represent the miners and was too cozy with the mine owners. In 1965, Boyle removed Yablonski as president of District 5 (under changes enacted by Boyle, district presidents were appointed by him, rather than being elected by union members of their district, giving him more control. In May 1969, Yablonski announced his candidacy for president of the union in the election to be held later that year. As early as June, Boyle was reportedly discussing the need to kill his opponent. UMWA presidential candidacy The United Mine Workers was in turmoil by 1969. Legendary UMWA president John L. Lewis had retired in 1960. His successor, Thomas Kennedy, died in 1963. From retirement, Lewis hand-picked Boyle for the UMWA presidency. A Montana miner, Boyle was as autocratic and bullying as Lewis, but not as well liked.Lewis, Murder By Contract: The People v. 'Tough Tony' Boyle, 1975.Franklin, \\"Rank and File Rebellion Stirs in Mine Union, Posing Threat to Lewis Legacy,\\" New York Times, June 13, 1969. From the beginning of his administration, Boyle faced significant opposition from rank-and-file miners and UMWA leaders. Miners' attitudes about their union had also changed. Miners wanted greater democracy and more autonomy for their local unions. There was also a widespread belief that Boyle was more concerned with protecting mine owners' interests than those of his members. Grievances filed by the union often took months‚Äîsometimes years‚Äîto resolve, lending credence to the critics' claim. Wildcat strikes occurred as local unions, despairing of UMWA assistance, sought to resolve local disputes with walkouts.Lockard, Coal: A Memoir and Critique, 1998. In 1969, Yablonski challenged Boyle for the presidency of UMWA. He was the first anti-administration insurgent candidate in 40 years. In an election widely seen as corrupt, Boyle beat Yablonski in the election held on December 9, by a margin of nearly two-to-one (80,577 to 46,073). Yablonski conceded the election.Franklin, \\"Boyle Claims Victory In Mine Union Race,\\" New York Times, December 11, 1969 On December 18, 1969, he asked the United States Department of Labor (DOL) to investigate the election for fraud.\\"Loser Asks Inquiry Into Mine Election,\\" Associated Press, December 12, 1969 He also initiated five civil lawsuits against UMWA in federal court, on related matters. He alleged that: Boyle and UMWA had denied him use of the union's mailing lists as provided for by law, he had been removed from his position as acting director of Labor's Non-Partisan League in retaliation for his candidacy, the UMW Journal was being used by Boyle as a campaign and propaganda mouthpiece, UMWA had no rules for fair elections, and had printed nearly 51,000 excess ballots which should have been destroyed; and UMWA had violated its fiduciary duties by spending union funds on Boyle's reelection.Franklin, \\"Mine Union Change Likely After Vote,\\" New York Times, December 14, 1969. These charges and their resolution are outlined in the civil case Kenneth J. Yablonski and Joseph A. Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America et al., 466 F.2d 424 (August 3, 1972), which his sons carried to the end. Murder On December 31, 1969, three hitmen fatally shot Yablonski, his wife Margaret, and his 25-year-old daughter Charlotte, as they slept in the Yablonski home in Clarksville, Pennsylvania. The bodies were discovered on January 5, 1970, by one of Yablonski's sons, Kenneth. An investigation found that the killings had been ordered by Boyle, who had demanded Yablonski's death on June 23, 1969, after a meeting with Yablonski at UMWA headquarters degenerated into a shouting match. In September 1969, UMWA executive council member Albert Pass received $20,000 from Boyle (who had embezzled the money from union funds) to hire gunmen to kill Yablonski. He hired Paul Gilly, an out-of-work house painter and son-in-law of Silous Huddleston, a minor UMWA official, and two drifters, Aubran Martin and Claude Vealey. The murder was ordered postponed until after the election, however, to avoid suspicion falling on Boyle. After three aborted attempts to murder Yablonski, the killers completed the assassinations, deciding to kill everyone in the house. They left so many fingerprints behind, that the police identified and captured them within three days.\\"The Yablonski Contract,\\" Time, May 15, 1972; \\"The Fall of Tony Boyle,\\" Time, September 17, 1973. A few hours after Yablonski's funeral, several of the miners who had supported Yablonski met in the basement of the church where the memorial service was held. They met with attorney Joseph Rauh and drew up plans to establish a reform caucus within the United Mine Workers.Peterson, \\"The Tragedy of the Miners,\\" Washington Post, January 16, 1977. The day after the bodies of the Yablonskis were discovered, 20,000 miners in West Virginia walked off the job in a one-day strike, protesting against Boyle, whom they believed was responsible for the murders.Franklin, \\"More Miners Protest Slayings,\\" New York Times, January 8, 1970. Aftermath of Yablonski's murder On January 8, 1970, Yablonski's attorney waived the right to further internal review of the election b the union and requested an immediate investigation by DOL of the 1969 union presidential election. On January 17, 1972, the United States Supreme Court granted Mike Trbovich, a 51-year-old coal mine shuttle car operator and union member from District 5 (Yablonski's district), permission to intervene in the DOL suit as a complainant, which kept Yablonski's election fraud suit alive. Labor Secretary George P. Shultz assigned 230 investigators to the UMWA investigation and Attorney General Mitchell ordered the FBI to join the murder inquiry.\\"Mitchell Orders F.B.I. to Join Inquiry Into Yablonski Slayings,\\" New York Times, January 7, 1970; Franklin, \\"Inquiry Is Ordered Into Mine Election,\\" New York Times, January 9, 1970. The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) of 1959 regulates the internal affairs of labor unions, requiring regular secret-ballot elections for local union offices and providing for federal investigation of election fraud or impropriety. DOL is authorized under the act to sue in federal court to have the election overturned. By 1970, however, only three international union elections had been overturned by the courts.\\"Vindication for Jock Yablonski,\\" Time, March 16, 1970. Gilly, Martin and Vealey were arrested days after the assassinations and indicted for Yablonski's death. All were convicted of first-degree murder. Gilly and Vealey were sentenced to death; Martin avoided execution by pleading guilty and turning state's evidence.Franklin, \\"3 Held in Yablonski Deaths,\\" New York Times, January 22, 1970; Flint, \\"Murder Charges Filed,\\" New York Times, January 23, 1970; \\"Yablonski Friends Say Suspect Visited Slain Man's Home Before Killing,\\" New York Times, January 23, 1970; Franklin, \\"Yablonski Inquiry Reported to Focus On a Sum of Money,\\" New York Times, January 24, 1970; \\"Grand Jury Is Checking Financial Records of a U.M.W.

(Both Annette Gilly and her father Silous Huddleston pleaded guilty in 1972, receiving life sentences to avoid the death penalty.)Franklin, \\"Yablonski Defendant Pleads Guilty to Escape Chair,\\" New York Times, April 12, 1972 Miners for Democracy (MFD) formed in April 1970, while the DOL investigation of the 1969 election continued. Its members included most of the miners who belonged to the West Virginia Black Lung Association and many of Yablonski's supporters and former campaign staff. MFD's support was strongest in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and the panhandle and northern portions of West Virginia, but MFD supporters existed in nearly all affiliates. The chief organizers of Miners for Democracy included Yablonski's sons, Joseph (known as \\"Chip\\") and Ken, Mike Trbovich, and other union supporters.\\"Oral History Interview With Dr. Donald Rasmussen,\\" March 1, 2004.Franklin, \\"U.S. Action Urged By U.M.W. Faction,\\" New York Times, October 4, 1970; Franklin, \\"Dissident Miners Seek Funds Here,\\" New York Times, November 15, 1970. DOL filed suit in federal court in 1971 to overturn the 1969 UMWA election. After several lengthy delays, the suit went to trial on September 12, 1971. On May 1, 1972, Judge William Bryant threw out the results of the 1969 UMWA international union elections. Bryant scheduled a new election to be held during the first eight days of December 1972. In addition, Bryant agreed that DOL should oversee the election to ensure fairness.The details of the investigation and suit may be found in Hodgson v. United Mine Workers of America, 344 F. Supp. 17 (May 1, 1972).Franklin, \\"U.M.W.'s Spending Detailed in Suit,\\" New York Times, January 24, 1971; Franklin, \\"U.S. Again Delays Mine Union Trial,\\" New York Times, May 30, 1971; Franklin, \\"U.M.W. Head Faces Suit on Election,\\" New York Times, September 12, 1971; Vasquez, \\"U.M.W. Election of Boyle Is Upset by Federal Judge,\\" New York Times, May 2, 1972. On May 28, 1972, MFD nominated Arnold Miller, a miner from West Virginia who challenged Boyle for the presidency, based on the need for black lung legislation to protect the miners.Franklin, \\"Reform Miners Select Candidate to Run Against Boyle,\\" New York Times, May 29, 1972; Franklin, \\"Angry U.M.W. Insurgent Arnold Ray Miller,\\" New York Times, May 30, 1972. Balloting for the next UMWA president began on December 1, 1972. Balloting ended on December 9, and Miller was declared the victor on December 15. The Labor Department certified Miller as UMWA's next president on December 22. The vote was 70,373 for Miller and 56,334 for Boyle.Vasquez, \\"Overseer Named for U.M.W.

Two of the convicted murderers had accused Boyle of masterminding and funding the assassination plot. The murder investigation and confessions of other conspirators revealed the financial and other trails leading back to Boyle. In April 1973 Boyle was indicted on three counts of murder; he was convicted in April 1974. He was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison, where he died in 1985.Franklin, \\"Boyle Is Accused In Yablonski Case,\\" New York Times, March 10, 1973; Franklin, \\"Boyle Is Implicated By Yablonski Killer,\\" New York Times, March 14, 1973; Franklin, \\"Jury Finds Boyle Guilty In 3 Yablonski Murders,\\" New York Times, April 12, 1974; \\"Boyle Is Given Three Life Terms In '69 Murder of the Yablonskis,\\" Associated Press, September 12, 1975. Honors and legacy In 1973, Yablonski posthumously received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, made annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1995, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker in California, Pennsylvania commemorating Yablonski's life and work. Portrayal in popular culture Barbara Kopple's 1976 documentary, Harlan County USA, included a segment on Yablonski's murder and its aftermath. It also includes the song \\"Cold Blooded Murder\\" (also known as \\"The Yablonski Murder\\"), sung by Hazel Dickens. John Sayles's novel Union Dues (1977) is a fictional account of miners fighting for proper union representation in 1969. The Boyle-Yablonski dispute is a sub-plot which several characters mention, expressing their opinions of unions and corruption. The 1986 HBO television movie, Act of Vengeance, was about the union struggle and the murders. Wilford Brimley played Boyle and Charles Bronson (a native of Ehrenfeld in the western Pennsylvania mining region) portrayed Yablonski.\\"News of the Screen,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1973; Schneider, \\"This Time Around, Bronson Portrays the Victim,\\" New York Times, April 20, 1986.

A part of the fund has been transferred to Baghdad and Iraq, and the DFI-Baghdad account was opened at the Central Bank of Iraq \\"for cash payment requirements\\". The fund also eventually received money (US$1.724 billion) from seized and \\"vested\\" Iraqi bank accounts and funds seized by coalition forces ($926.7 million). ($650 million) of this amount belongs to Uday Saddam Hussein, the older son of the former Iraqi president. (This money was also used during the transition period before the DFI was set up.) The DFI have been disbursed mainly for \\"the wheat purchase program, the currency exchange program, the electricity and oil infrastructure programs, equipment for Iraqis security forces, and for Iraqi civil service salaries and ministry budget operations\\". The DFI was put under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the administrative arm of the US-UK occupation forces. International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) was created in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003). IAMB is an independent oversight body for DFI and its principal role is to ensure transparency and financial accountability of the DFI. The IAMB was operated from the establishment of the DFI on May 22, 2003 until the dissolution of the CPA on June 28, 2004. In October 2004, the audits conducted by IAMB and KPMG revealed the CPA‚Äôs inadequate accounting system. IAMB failed its oversight process for several months because of procedural disputes and US manipulation. During this time illegal export of petroleum was conducted secretly from Iraq, and a large amount of funds for DFI were disbursed without accountability. According to the audits conducted by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), US$8.8 billion of the US$23 billion of Iraqi money disbursed for DFI has not been accounted the use. After June 28, 2004, the Iraqi Interim Government had administered the DFI under the IAMB‚Äôs oversight following to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 until December 31, 2006. Paul Bremer led the Coalition Provisional Authority. During his administration Ambassador Bremer was criticized by some for spending down over 90% of the Development Funds for Iraq. Less than 5% of the $18 billion Congress had set aside for reconstruction were spent during that period. These funds make up the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, which is largely managed by the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office. USAID also plays a role in managing these funds. Since the transfer of sovereignty in June 2004, the Development Fund for Iraq has been managed by the Iraqi Transitional Government. Audits There have been several audits of the disbursement from the DFI during the CPA's stewardship. The first was performed by international accounting firm KPMG. United States Congressman Henry Waxman had the staff of the Committee on Government Reform to perform another audit of DFI's expenditures. KPMG audit International auditors KPMG were chosen by the Coalition Provisional Authority and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board to perform external audits of the Coalition's expenditures from the humanitarian Development Fund for Iraq. The IAMB started negotiating with the CPA to appoint an external auditor in December 2003. KPMG was appointed in April 2004, to audit the CPA's expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue in 2003. On July 15, 2004 KPMG released audit documents that highlighted several dozen serious accounting discrepancies. Note particularly the appendix devoted to Matters noted involving internal controls and other operational issues during the audit period of the Fund For the period to 31 December, 2003 United Nations Resolution 1483 transferred the authority to authorize expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue from the United Nations to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It also created an international body to monitor the Coalition's expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue, the IAMB. The Coalition's authority to expend Iraq's oil revenue was conditional. The Coalition was only authorized to expend those funds for the benefit of the Iraqi people. Those expenditures were only authorized if they were made in an open and transparent manner. The Coalition was only authorized to expend funds so long as they cooperated in the IAMB's oversight of those expenditures. The Coalition was charged with the obligation to make those expenditures with meaningful Iraqi input. Paragraphs 12 and 20 of UN resolution 1483 specified that an external auditor would be appointed to audit the expenditure made from Iraq's oil revenue. The auditors identified dozens of serious ways in which the CPA failed to meet its obligations: * Lack of cooperation with the auditors. CPA administrator Paul Bremer has complained that the independent Inspector General Stuart Bowen, whom the Congress appointed, never met with him. In contrast the KPMG auditors say Mr Bremer never scheduled a meeting with them, prior to the official hand- over, and surprised everyone by leaving Iraq early immediately after his early handover of authority to the Interim government. George Wolfe, the chairman of the Program Review Board, Iraq's de facto Treasurer \\"was unable to acknowledge the fair presentation of the statement of cash receipts and payments, the completeness of significant contracts entered into by the DFI and responsibilities for the implementation and operations of accounting and internal control systems, designed to prevent and detect fraud and error.\\" * Internal auditor. In the CPA Administrator's second regulation, of 10 June 2003, Bremer committed the CPA to \\"obtain the services of an independent certified public accounting firm to support the objective of ensuring that the Fund is administered and used in a transparent manner for the benefit of the people of Iraq, and is operated consistent with Resolution 1483. The accountants performing this function shall be separate from those public accountants (auditors) approved by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.\\" But Bremer never obtained the services of an internal auditor. Instead the CPA hired a consulting firm, to set up a bookkeeping system ‚Äì incomplete at the time of the handover. * Double entry bookkeeping. The CPA did not use a double-entry bookkeeping system. Instead, it used what that auditors called a single entry, cash-based, transaction list‚Äî$20 billion of petty cash. The CPA did not do a cash-reconciliation until April 2004, eleven months into its administration. At that point, the CPA had disbursed $6 billion in $100 bills. * Metering Iraq's oil. Iraq's oil infrastructure was damaged when the CPA took over. The CPA effected selected repairs. But the IAMB found that the CPA had chosen not to repair the meters on the pipelines. The IAMB told the CPA that they were concerned that the lack of metering made auditing Iraq's oil exports unreliable ‚Äì making it impossible to detect fraud, deception or smuggling. The minutes of the IAMB meeting make clear that the CPA had assured the IAMB that they were in the process of repairing the meters ‚Äì in bad faith. The CPA's authority came to an end with the meters unrepaired. Estimates of how much oil revenue was siphoned off during the year of the CPA's administration go as high as $4 billion ‚Äì comparable to the amount Saddam Hussein is suspected of stealing during the entire duration of the oil-for-food program. * Record- keeping. The auditors found that the Program Review Board failed to keep proper minutes: **The PRB minutes did not always keep minutes of its meetings. **The PRB minutes almost never recorded the wording of minutes, or the vote tallies. **The auditors felt that the minutes did not record enough details for later readers to understand the reasons why the Board made their decisions. **The PRB minutes sometimes did not even record the who attended the meetings. **The auditors found that CPA staff responsible for overseeing programs were often unable to find their program files. They could not be counted on to be familiar with the programs they were responsible for. Waxman audit On June 20, 2005 the staff on Congressman Waxman's Committee on Government Reform released a highly critical report. In their International Advisory and Monitoring Board's press release of June 22, 2004 states: :\\"The IAMB was also informed by the CPA that contrary to earlier representations the award of metering contracts have been delayed and continues to urge the expeditious resolution of this critical issue.\\" The CPA was shipping Iraqi oil through a pipeline system with non-functioning meters. The actual amount of oil being shipped would have had to be estimated. The Iraqi people were left in the position where they had to trust that the CPA's estimates were honest. Criticism=Lack of transparency The Development Fund for Iraq receives 95 per cent of the government proceeds from Iraqi oil sales. The 2003 budget also noted that the Development Fund will provide $1.2 billion for the budget. However, the relationship between the DFI and the budget has not been made clear‚Äîthe budget anticipated oil revenues of $3.4 billion‚Äîmuch greater than the amount in the DFI then. Moreover, only the Provisional Authority Administrator could authorise spending from the DFI. Little information has been made public about the DFI. The Coalition Provisional Authority excluded information on its web site about any transfer of assets into and out of the DFI.

The species is known from massive tree trunks that weather out of the Chinle Formation in desert badlands of northern Arizona and adjacent New Mexico and Chemnitz petrified forest in Chemnitz, Germany, most notably in the Petrified Forest National Park. There, these trunks are locally so abundant that they have been used as building materials. Description The petrified wood of this tree is frequently referred to as \\"Rainbow wood\\" because of the large variety of colors some specimens exhibit. The red and yellow are produced by large particulate forms of iron oxide, the yellow being limonite and the red being hematite. The purple hue comes from extremely fine spherules of hematite distributed throughout the quartz matrix, and not from manganese, as has sometimes been suggested. Paleoecology In the Triassic period (around ), Arizona was a flat tropical expanse in the northwest corner of the supercontinent Pangaea. There, a forest grew in which A. arizonicum towered as high as and measured more than in diameter. Fossils frequently show boreholes of insect larvae, possibly beetles similar to members of the modern family Ptinidae. Taxonomy Araucarioxylon arizonicum is classified under family Araucariaceae. They were first described in 1889 by the American paleobotanist Frank Hall Knowlton. The validity of the name Araucarioxylon arizonicum has been questioned. A. arizonicum may actually be composed of several different genera and species. A 2007 study on the syntypes used by Knowlton in describing the species has revealed that they belonged to three species. They were tentatively reclassified as Pullisilvaxylon arizonicum, Pullisilvaxylon daughertii, and Chinleoxylon knowltonii. The genus Araucarioxylon may thus be superfluous and illegitimate; and the petrified logs of Petrified Forest National Park may be composed of a greater diversity than initially believed.

He played college football for Mississippi State University, and was recognized as an All-American. The Washington Redskins chose him in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, and he also played professionally for the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Early years Smoot was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He attended Provine High School in Jackson, and played for the Provine rams high school football team. He was selected to play in the Mississippi-Alabama high school all-star game as a senior. College career Smoot attended Mississippi State University, where he played for the Mississippi State Bulldogs football team from 1997 to 2000. He started his junior and senior years, and was a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection both years, and a consensus first-team All-American as a senior.2011 NCAA Football Records Book, Award Winners, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011). Retrieved June 24, 2012. He was also a finalist for the Conerly Trophy in 2000. Professional career=First stint with Redskins Smoot was drafted by the Washington Redskins as the 14th pick in the second round (45th pick overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft out of Mississippi State. Many believed he was a first-round caliber player but because of questionable off-the-field problems many teams shied away from him. Afterwards, he proclaimed himself to be the steal of the draft. In Smoot's four years with the Redskins, he collected 16 interceptions, and formed an impressive duo with Champ Bailey. Minnesota Vikings Following a strong season as part of the impressive Redskins defense in 2004, Smoot left the club as a free agent to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. However, he was not able to duplicate his success in Minnesota. Smoot reportedly bulked up in the 2006 offseason. His playing weight was listed at 178 lb for the 2005 season and in May 2006 the press reported he weighed about 200 lb. He faced very stiff competition for the starting spot since the Vikings drafted cornerback Cedric Griffin in the second round and cornerback Ronyell Whitaker was named All NFL Europa. In the third game of the season against Chicago, Smoot sat out the opening drive reportedly for discipline reasons. Coach Brad Childress said that was between him and Smoot. In the 11th game of the season, Smoot was benched in favor of starting Griffin instead. Childress said the switch was merited in performance and Griffin had been doing an excellent job. =Love Boat scandal= Smoot was at the center of the 2005 Minnesota Vikings boat cruise scandal involving several of his Minnesota Vikings' teammates. Some Vikings players had rented a boat on Lake Minnetonka and reportedly hired prostitutes to have a \\"sex party\\" on the boat. Smoot allegedly held a purple double-headed dildo and inserted it into the vaginas of two women who were lying on the floor in the lounge area. After one woman left, he continued to \\"manipulate the dildo\\" inside the other woman in front of the young crew. Formal charges for the Boat Scandal were filed on December 15. Smoot was also alleged to have organized the whole party, an accusation he denied. On May 2, 2006, Smoot pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and being a public nuisance on a watercraft in connection with the Love Boat scandal. He agreed to pay a $1,007 fine and perform 48 hours of community service. Vikings owner Zygi Wilf said, in addition to community service, he would participate in numerous service events this season. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said fines were likely, but Smoot would not be suspended. On September 9, 2006, the NFL imposed a fine equivalent to one game's salary against Smoot and former Vikings teammate Bryant McKinnie for their role in the Love Boat scandal, Smoot's fine was $82,352. Washington Redskins training camp in 2008. =Car crash= Smoot broke his jaw in a single-vehicle crash in Mississippi on December 22, 2006, where he was spending the week. His jaw was broken in five different spots. As a result, he was out for the rest of the season. Second stint with the Redskins He was released on March 1, 2007 from the Vikings. On March 3, 2007, the Redskins signed Smoot to a five-year deal worth $25 million. He was released on March 4, 2010. Business ventures=SMACK Energy Bar In November 2007, Smoot launched his own energy bar known as SMACK Energy chocolate bar. The website for this endeavor appears to have been abandoned in 2008. No orders are being taken at this time. Waffle House In April 2010, Smoot announced that he planned to open up a Waffle House in Washington, D.C.. He planned to open the first restaurant in the area of 14th and U streets NW. However, due to D.C. zoning laws, he admitted in 2015 that he was looking at other venues, potentially in Northern Virginia.https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3bj4cf/whats_up_rnfl_this_is_fred_smoot_ask_me_anything/?limit=500 Personal life Smoot has advocated for the passage of the FIT Kids Act, federal legislation that would require school districts to report on students' physical activity while also distributing health and nutritional information.NFL Players Promoted Increased Physical Education ESPN, March 19, 2009 Domestic violence accusation On November 25, 2014, Smoot was arrested by the Loudoun County Sheriff‚Äôs Office on a domestic abuse charge against his former girlfriend, Valerie Jackson.

The awarding of the Claret Jug dates from 1872, when a new trophy was needed after Young Tom Morris had won the original Challenge Belt (presented by Prestwick Golf Club) outright in 1870 by winning the Championship three years in a row. Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870. By the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871. Each club contributed ¬£10 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh. When the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners. In 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship. The original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family. The current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist: one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions. Every year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. Despite some suggestions, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was not engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff - engraver Alex Harvey stated \\"No, I didn't start engraving the Jug with his name. I've got to wait until the secretary hands me a slip of paper with the winner's name on it, and they always wait until the last putt is dropped.\\". Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, \\"How's my name going to fit on that thing?\\" The Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative ¬£5 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.

The central characters are the title of the Lotus S≈´tra. Gohonzon is a generic term for a venerated religious object in Japanese Buddhism. It may take the form of a scroll or statuary. In Nichiren Buddhism, it refers to the hanging calligraphic paper mandala inscribed by Nichiren to which devotional chanting is directed.http://www.rk- world.org/(S(owuk1kwav5sbfeshnwzpljmp))/news_archive_show.aspx?archiveid=1562 Linguistically, the root \\"honzon\\" signifies a main object of devotion or worship and \\"go\\" is an honorific prefix.Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged (2012). HarperCollins Publishers Nichiren groups translate \\"Gohonzon\\" different ways: \\"object of devotion\\" (Soka Gakkai),http://www.sgi.org/about-us/gohonzon.html \\"object of worship\\" (Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´), or \\"Supreme Venerable\\" (Nichiren-sh≈´).http://www.nichiren- shu.org/Sanfrancisco/pages/study/nine.htm It has also been translated as \\"the Great Mandala\\". Paper scroll Gohonzon are sometimes known as Kakejiku Gohonzon or moji-mandara ( \\"script mandala\\" or \\"mandala written with characters\\"). Butsuzo Gohonzon are statuary. The Gohonzon is often enshrined within a butsudan.  In Nichiren Buddhism  The moji-mandala gohonzon or \\"Mandala gohonzon\\" () is the primary object of devotion in Nichiren schools. It is the exclusive object of veneration in the schools that follow the lineage of Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin such as Kensh≈çkai, Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´, Sh≈çshinkai, and Soka Gakkai.  Description  Nichiren himself attached the greatest importance to his inscription of the Gohonzon and claimed this as a pivotal moment in his life.Anesaki 2010, p. 86 He stated that by using sumi ink to inscribe it he was acting like a \\"lion king.\\" Nichiren's calligraphy shifted over the years he inscribed Gohonzon. Details of the composition of the Gohonzon are clear from the approximately 120-125 inscribed in Nichiren's own hand, dating from 1271 to 1282, that are extant.Stone 1998, p.153 For example, a Gohonzon he inscribed in July 1273 was inscribed on a piece of silk 2.5 ft by 5.5 ft. Copies of the original Gohonzon have been made by others and can be found in varying sizes. A \\"Joju Gohonzon\\" is inscribed for a specific person or organization, an \\"Okatagi Gohonzon\\" is generic and produced through a wood block process. Nichiren and his successors also inscribed smaller \\"Omamori\\" Gohonzon that are carried on the person.Stone 1998, p. 153 Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´'s Dai Gohonzon is transcribed on camphor wood. The Gohonzon could be described through its significance and the literal meaning of its calligraphy. Gohonzon inscribed by Nikken Abe used by the Nichiren Shoshu school  Significance  Yampolsky describes Nichiren's Gohonzon as a mandala, a concretized object that Nichiren inscribed to transmit what he regarded as the essence of the Lotus Sutra. It is also described as a depiction of the Ceremony in the Air in the 11th Chapter of the Lotus Sutra, \\"The Emergence of the Treasure Tower\\".Stone 2003, p. 281 It is the first of the \\"three great secret laws\\" of Nichiren Buddhism, the others being Nam My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç and the platform of ordination or place of worship. Ellwood and Pilgrim describe it as a \\"mandala of the cosmos as perceived inwardly by Nichiren.\\" Anesaki describes it as \\"a physical embodiment of the truth of cosmic existence as realized in the all- comprehensive conception of 'mutual participation, and illuminated by the all- enlightening power of the Truth.'\\" According to Stone, \\"By having faith in the daimoku and chanting it before this object of worship, [Nichiren taught] one could in effect enter the mandala and participate in the enlightened reality that it depicts.\\" The Gohonzon has also been described in more colloquial terms. Nichiren himself referred to it as \\"the banner of propagation\\" and \\"a cluster of blessings.\\"Writings of Nichiren Daishonin-1, p. 832 J≈çsei Toda quipped the Gohonzon simply as \\"a happiness-producing machine,\\" a means for harmonizing with \\"universal life force.\\" Daisaku Ikeda refers to it as a mirror that reflects one's inner life.  Literal meaning of the calligraphy  The Gohonzon is written in traditional kanji characters with the addition of two Siddha·πÉ scripts. Although exclusive to the other Buddhist sects of his contemporaneous society, Nichiren was highly inclusive of Vedic and Chinese traditions, viewing them as precursors of his own teachings and personages from these traditions are present on the Gohonzon. Most prominent to all such Gohonzon is the phrase Namu My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç‚Äîthe primary mantra in Nichiren Buddhism‚Äîwritten down the center in bold calligraphy.Morgan, 121 This is called the daimoku () or shudai (, \\"title\\"). Right below, also in bold, Nichiren writes his name followed by his seal. This signifies Nichiren's conviction that his life had manifested the essence of the Lotus Sutra. On the top row can be found the names of Gautama Buddha and Prabhutaratna and the four leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth. The names of deities believed to protect the Buddha land, called the Four Heavenly Kings (Bishamonten, Jikokuten, K≈çmokuten, and Z≈çj≈çten), further occupy the four corners, and Sanskrit characters depicting Aizen My≈ç-≈ç and Fud≈ç My≈ç-≈ç are situated along the left and right outer edges. Within this frame are the names of various Buddhas, bodhisattvas, historical and mythological figures in Buddhism, personages representing the ten realms, and deities drawn from Vedic, Chinese, and Japanese traditions are arranged hierarchically. Each of these names represents some aspect of the Buddha's enlightenment or an important Buddhist concept.Stone, 2003, 277-278  Map of Nichikan Gohonzon  The Nichikan- inscribed Gohonzon consists of 34 blocks of calligraphy.https://www.sgi- usa.org/study-resources/core-concepts/the-gohonzon/diagram-of-the-gohonzon/#22 The original copy was inscribed in 1720 by Nichikan (1665-1726), the twenty- sixth chief abbot of Taiseki-ji. In 1993 the Soka Gakkai began to confer Gohonzon replicas based on this mandala. Many of its members opted to replace their old Gohonzon with this transcription. = Center = The bolded calligraphy of the central core of the Gohonzon has been compared to the stupa in the Ceremony in the Air. It is divided into three sections: (1) Namu My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç, (2) the name of Nichiren, and (3) his seal (Zai gohan). = Frame = The core is framed on four sides. On the top row are the two Buddhas who are seated within the treasure tower that emerges in the 11th \\"The Emergence of the Treasure Tower\\" chapter of the Lotus Sutra: (4) Gautam Buddha and (5) Prabhutaratna or \\"Many Treasures\\" Buddha. Flanking them are the four leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth to whom Gautama, in the 22nd \\"Entrustment\\" chapter, entrusts the protection and propagation of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law. They are: (6) Jogyo Bosatsu, Bodhisattva Superior Practices (Skt. Visistacaritra); (7) Muhengyo Bosatsu, Bodhisattva Boundless Practices (Skt. Anantacharitra); (8) Anryugyo Bosatsu, Bodhisattva Firmly Established Practices (Skt. Supratisthitacaritra) and (9) Jyogyo Bosatsu, Bodhisattva Pure Practices (Skt. Visuddhacaritra).

Description: 5 cases; 51-69 cm, case 1: Gohonzonsh≈´ (125 leaves; 66 x 47 x 5 cm) He began inscribing Gohonzon immediately before and during his exile on Sado between late 1271 and early 1274. This follows the attempted and failed execution of him at Tatsunokuchi Beach in 1271. In various letters he referred to this event as his \\"casting off the transient and revealing the true\\" (Jpn hosshaku-kempon), at which time he claimed to have discarded his transient status and revealed his essential identity as the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. According to Ikeda, Nichiren's intent in manifesting the Gohonzon was to allow people to connect directly with the Law so they, too, could discard the transient and reveal their essential enlightened selves. The first extant Gohonzon was inscribed by Nichiren on October 9, 1271 before his transport to Sado Island. Stone describes it as embryonic in form. On July 8, 1273 Nichiren inscribed a Gohonzon in its full form with the inscription \\"Nichiren inscribes this for the first time.\\" Early photograph of the Dai-Gohonzon at Taisekiji. Printed in Kumada Ij≈ç's book Nichiren Sh≈çnin in 1913.Kumada Ij≈ç (ÁÜäÁî∞Ëë¶Âüé) (1913 ). Nichiren Sh≈çnin (Êó•ËìÆ‰∏ä‰∫∫), 8th edition, page 375 During his exile in Sado Island (1271-1274) Nichiren wrote two treatises explaining the significance of the object of devotion from the theoretical perspectives of the person (The Opening of the Eyes) and the law (The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind). Nichiren wrote additional letters to his followers bestowing Gohonzon to them and further explaining their significance: \\"Letter to Misawa,\\" \\"Reply to Kyo'o,\\" \\"The Real Aspect of the Gohonzon,\\" and \\"On the Treasure Tower.\\"  Controversies  Nichiren Shoshu claims that the Dai Gohonzon at its head temple is superior to all other Gohonzon. This contention is disputed by others. In 1991 the Soka Gakkai was excommunicated by Nichiren Shoshu and thereby lost its source of Gohonzon. In 1993 the Soka Gakkai began to confer to new members a copy of a Gohonzon inscribed by Nichikan Shonin, the 26th chief abbot of Taisekiji. There is also a controversy about the function and efficacy of Gohonzon that are now available for purchase or downloadable printing on various websites.

Rennyo thought the written mantra was more appropriate than a statue but did not ascribe particular powers to it as do Nichiren's followers to their Gohonzon. In Mikky≈ç practices such as in Shingon Buddhism, the term \\"honzon\\" to refers to the divinity honored in a rite but later came to represent the formal object of worship. The tutelary figure's role is similar to that of the yidam in Tibetan Buddhism. Tutelary deities in Vajrayana, including Mikky≈ç, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism, are crucial to many religious practices. In the famous Goma fire ritual ceremony, the fire itself while it is being consumed and animated is also considered a temporary Gohonzon. See also * Kotodama NotesFurther reading * Ikeda, D. (2012).

For most of its history it was ‚Äôannexed and united‚Äô to the English Crown except for its earliest few decades. However, for a few generations, specifically the period from its foundation in 1216 to the completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284, it was de facto independent under a Welsh prince of Wales, albeit one who swore fealty to the king of England. The Principality was formally founded in 1216 at the Council of Aberdyfi and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between Llywelyn the Great of Wales and Henry III of England. The treaty gave substance to the political reality of 13th-century Wales and England, and the relationship of the former with the Angevin Empire. The principality retained a great degree of autonomy, characterized by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of Cyfraith Hywel, and by the increasingly sophisticated court of the House of Aberffraw. Although it owed fealty to the Angevin king of England, the principality was de facto independent, with a similar status in the empire to the Kingdom of Scotland. Its existence has been seen as proof that all the elements necessary for the growth of Welsh statehood were in place. The period of de facto independence ended with Edward I's conquest of the principality between 1277 and 1283. Under the Statute of Rhuddlan the principality lost its independence and became effectively an annexed territory of the English crown. From 1301, the crown's lands in north and west Wales formed part of the appanage of England's heir apparent, with the title \\"Prince of Wales\\". On accession of the prince to the English throne, the lands and title became merged with the Crown again. On two occasions Welsh claimants to the title rose up in rebellion during this period, although neither ultimately succeeded. Since the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542, which formally incorporated Wales into the Kingdom of England and rapid outward recognition of such in the form of the common law and higher including appellate courts of England and Wales, which remains, there has been no geographical or constitutional basis for describing any of Wales as a principality, although the term has occasionally been used in an informal sense to describe the country, and in relation to the honorary title of Prince of Wales.  Foundations  The 13th-century Principality of Wales was based on the historic lands ruled by the Aberffraw family, lands in north Wales traditionally including Ynys M√¥n, Gwynedd-Uwch-Conwy (Gwynedd above the Conwy, or Upper Gwynedd), and the Perfeddwlad (the Middle Country) also known as Gwynedd-Is-Conwy (Gwynedd below the Conwy, or Lower Gwynedd). Additional lands were acquired through vassalage or conquest, and by regaining lands lost to Marcher lords, particularly that of the Perfeddwlad, Powys Fadog, Powys Wenwynwyn, and Ceredigion. Previous Welsh rulers had styled themselves in a variety of ways, usually in relation to a certain patrimony like \\"Lord of Ceredigion\\" or \\"King of Builth\\". The most powerful were often referred to (by others at least) as \\"King of the Britons\\". As Wales was a defined geographical area with agreed borders, yet outside the bounds of England, anyone bestowed with the title Prince of Wales would have suzerainty over any local Welsh ruler but without the territorial ambitions on England of a King of the Britons ‚Äì which implied \\"liberating\\" the Britons who still resided in places long considered a part of England such as Devon, Cornwall, Cumberland and other places, albeit in fewer and fewer numbers. The Aberffraw family had long claimed primacy over all other Welsh lords, including over those rulers of Powys and of Deheubarth. In The History of Gruffydd ap Cynan, written in the late 12th century, the family asserted its rights as the senior line of descendants from Rhodri the Great, who had ruled most of Wales between 820‚Äì870, and whose sons came to rule in Gwynedd, Deheubarth, and Powys.Rhodri inherited Gwynedd from his father and Powys from his mother, married Angharad, heiress Seisyllwg (modern Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire). Gruffudd ap Cynan's biography was first written in Latin and intended for a wider audience outside Wales. The significance of this claim was that the Aberffraw family owed nothing to the English king for its position in Wales, and that they held authority in Wales \\"by absolute right through descent,\\" wrote historian John Davies.  Prior to 1284: under the House of Aberffraw  The Principality of Wales was created in 1216 at the Council of Aberdyfi, when it was agreed between Llywelyn the Great and the other sovereign princes among the Welsh that he was the paramount ruler amongst them, and they would pay homage to him. Later he obtained recognition, at least in part, of this agreement from the King of England, who agreed that Llywelyn's heirs and successors would enjoy the title \\"Prince of Wales\\" but with certain limitations to his realm and other conditions, including homage to the King of England as vassal, and adherence to rules regarding a legitimate succession. Llywelyn had been at pains to ensure that his heirs and successors would follow the \\"approved\\" (by the Pope at least) system of inheritance which excluded illegitimate sons. In so doing he excluded his elder bastard son Gruffydd ap Llywelyn from the inheritance, a decision which would have later ramifications. In 1240 Llywelyn died and Henry III of England (who succeeded John) promptly invaded large areas of his former realm, usurping them from him. However, the two sides came to peace and Henry honoured at least part of the agreement and bestowed upon Dafydd ap Llywelyn the title 'Prince of Wales'. This title would be granted to his successor Llywelyn in 1267 (after a campaign by him to achieve it) and was later claimed by his brother Dafydd and other members of the princely House of Aberffraw.  Aberffraw Princes  The traditional numbering of the Princes of Wales (according to Welsh sources) begins with Owain Gwynedd who ruled from 1137 until 1170. He was never acknowledged as Prince of Wales, and in fact never used that title; however he was considered by later chroniclers to have been the first Welsh prince to unite Wales. This was demonstrated when Owain Glynd≈µr was explicitly crowned as Owain IV of Wales in 1404. The English viewed it very differently and considered the title to be bestowed by them and with their grace on only Dafydd ap Llywelyn in 1240 and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1267. After 1301 the title was granted to the eldest son and heir of an English sovereign. = Owain Gwynedd 1137‚Äì70 = The prodigious Owain Gwynedd succeeded in retaining for his family the primary position in Wales which his father had achieved. In 1154 he defeated an English and Powysian invasion, but was forced to give up some territory bordering the River Dee. In later years he recaptured these areas and achieved a dominant position for Gwynedd in Wales which had not been seen for centuries. During Owain's reign he changed his title from \\"King of Gwynedd\\" to \\"Prince of the Welsh\\" (J. B. Smith, Owain Gwynedd, 14‚Äì16). = Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd c.1170‚Äì95 = Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd had usurped the crown from his siblings in a debilitating civil war within Gwynedd. He married the half-sister of king Henry II of England in 1174. He was eventually ousted in 1195 from his much reduced domain by his nephew Llywelyn. = Llywelyn ap Iorwerth 1195‚Äì1240 = Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn Fawr) ruled Gwynedd and most of Wales from 1195 to 1240 By 1200 Owain Gwynedd's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great) ap Iorwerth ruled over all of Gwynedd, with England endorsing all of Llywelyn's holdings that year.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994 Llywelyn I relations with English crown pg 136 England's endorsement was part of a larger strategy of reducing the influence of Powys Wenwynwyn, as King John had given William de Breos licence in 1200 to \\"seize as much as he could\\" from the native Welsh.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994 English policy in Wales pg 136, Hangs Welsh hostages pg 137 However, de Breos was in disgrace by 1208, and Llywelyn seized both Powys Wenwynwyn and northern Ceredigon. In his expansion, the Prince was careful not to antagonise King John, his father-in- law. Llywelyn had married Joan, King John's illegitimate daughter, in 1204. In 1209 Prince Llywelyn joined King John on his campaign in Scotland. However, by 1211 King John recognised the growing influence of Prince Llywelyn as a threat to English authority in Wales. King John invaded Gwynedd and reached the banks of the Menai, and Llywelyn was forced to cede the Perfeddwlad, and recognize John as his heir presumptive if Llywelyn's marriage to Joan did not produce any legitimate successors. Succession was a complicated matter given that Welsh law recognized children born out of wedlock as equal to those in born in wedlock and sometimes accepted claims through the female line.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Welsh law succession pg 136 By then, Llywelyn had several illegitimate children. Many of Llywelyn's Welsh allies had abandoned him during England's invasion of Gwynedd, preferring an overlord far away rather than one nearby.Davies, John, A History of Wales, By John Davies, Penguin, 1994 Welsh lords pg 135‚Äì136 These Welsh lords expected an unobtrusive English crown; but King John had a castle built at Aberystwyth, and his direct interference in Powys and the Perfeddwlad caused many of these Welsh lords to rethink their position. Llywelyn capitalised on Welsh resentment against King John, and led a church-sanctioned revolt against him. As King John was an enemy of the church, Pope Innocent III gave his blessing to Llywelyn's revolt. Wales c. 1217. Yellow: areas directly ruled by Llywelyn; Grey: areas ruled by Llywelyn's vassals; Green: Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales. Early in 1212 Llywelyn had regained the Perfeddwlad and burned the castle at Aberystwyth. Llywelyn's revolt caused John to postpone his invasion of France, and Philip Augustus, the King of France, was so moved as to contact Llywelyn and propose that they ally against the English kingDavies, John, A History of Wales Penguin, 1994 Relations with France pg 136 King John ordered the execution by hanging of his Welsh hostages, the sons of many of Llywelyn's supporters Llywelyn I was the first prince to receive the fealty of other Welsh lords at the 1216 Council of Aberdyfi, thus becoming the de facto Prince of Wales and giving substance to the Aberffraw claims. = Dafydd ap Llywelyn 1240‚Äì46 = On succeeding his father, Dafydd immediately had to contend with the claims of his half-brother, Gruffudd, to the throne. Having imprisoned Gruffudd, his ambitions were curbed by an invasion of Wales led by Henry III in league with a number of the captive Gruffudd's supporters. In August 1241, Dafydd capitulated and signed the Treaty of Gwerneigron, further restricting his powers. By 1244, however, Gruffudd was dead, and Dafydd seems to have benefited from the backing of many of his brother's erstwhile supporters. He was acknowledged by the Pope as Prince of Wales for a time, and defeated Henry III in battle in 1245 during the English king's second invasion of Wales. A truce was agreed in the autumn, and Henry withdrew; but Dafydd died unexpectedly in 1246 without issue. His wife, Isabella de Braose, returned to England; she was dead by 1248. Dafydd married Isabella de Braose in 1231. Their marriage produced no children, and there is no contemporary evidence that Dafydd sired any heirs. According to late genealogical sources collected by Bartrum (1973), Dafydd had two children by an unknown woman (or women), a daughter, Annes, and a son, Llywelyn ap Dafydd, who apparently later became Constable of Rhuddlan and was succeeded in that post by his son Cynwrig ap Llywelyn. = Owain Goch ap Gruffydd 1246‚Äì53 (d. 1282) = Following Dafydd's death, Gwynedd was divided between Owain Goch and his younger brother Llywelyn. This situation lasted until 1252 when their younger brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd reached his majority. Disagreement about how to further divide the realm led to conflict in 1253 in which Llywelyn was victorious. Owain spent the remainder of his days a prisoner of his brother. = Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 1246‚Äì82 = After achieving victory over his brothers, Llywelyn went on to reconquer the areas of Gwynedd occupied by England (the Perfeddwlad and others). His alliance with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, in 1265 against King Henry III of England allowed him to reconquer large areas of mid Wales from the English Marcher Lords. At the Treaty of Montgomery between England and Wales in 1267 Llywelyn was granted the title \\"Prince of Wales\\" for his heirs and successors and allowed to keep the lands he had conquered as well as the homage of lesser Welsh princes in return for his own homage to the King of England and payment of a substantial fee. Disputes between him, his brother Dafydd and English lords bordering his own led to renewed conflict with England (now ruled by Edward I) in 1277. Following the Treaty of Aberconwy Llywelyn was confined to Gwynedd-uwch-Conwy. He joined a revolt instigated by his brother Dafydd in 1282 in which he died in battle. = Dafydd ap Gruffudd 1282‚Äì83 = Dafydd assumed his elder brother's title in 1282 and led a brief period of continued resistance against England. He was captured and executed in 1283.  Government, administration and law  Drawing of a Welsh judge from the Peniarth 28 manuscript The political maturation of the principality's government fostered a more defined relationship between prince and the people. Emphasis was placed on the territorial integrity of the principality, with the prince as lord of all the land, and other Welsh lords swearing fealty to the prince directly, a distinction with which the Prince of Wales paid yearly tribute to the King of England.Davies, John A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Tribute to England pg 129, Treasury pg 153 By treaty the principality was obliged to pay the kingdom large annual sums. Between 1267 and 1272 Wales made a total payment of ¬£11,500, \\"proof of a growing money economy... and testimony of the effectiveness of the principality's financial administration,\\" wrote historian Dr. John Davies. Additionally, modifications and amendments to the Law Codes of Hywel Dda encouraged the decline of the galanas (blood-fine) and the use of the jury system. The Aberffraw dynasty maintained vigorous diplomatic and domestic policies; and patronized the Church in Wales, particularly that of the Cistercian Order. = The princely court = At the end of the twelfth century, beginning of the thirteenth century, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn Fawr or Llywelyn the Great), built a royal home at Abergwyngregyn, known as T≈∑ Hir, the Long House, in later documents. To the east was the newly endowed Cistercian Monastery of Aberconwy; to the west the cathedral city of Bangor. In 1211, King John of England brought an army across the river Conwy, and occupied the royal home for a brief period; his troops went on to burn Bangor. Llywelyn's wife, John's daughter Joan, also known as Joanna, negotiated between the two men, and John withdrew. Joan died at Abergwyngregyn in 1237; Dafydd ap Llywelyn died there in 1246; Eleanor de Montfort, Lady of Wales, wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, died there on 19 June 1282, giving birth to a baby, Gwenllian of Wales  Population, culture and society  The 13th- century Principality of Wales encompassed three-quarters of the surface area of modern Wales; \\"from Anglesey to Machen, from the outskirts of Chester to the outskirts of Cydweli,\\" wrote Davies.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, Aberffraw stability and effects on population, town-dwellers, decline in slavery, p. 151Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Aberffraw stability pg 219, 220 By 1271, Prince Llywelyn II could claim a growing population of about 200,000 people, or a little less than three-quarters of the total Welsh population. The population increase was common throughout Europe in the 13th century, but in Wales it was more pronounced. By Llywelyn II's reign as much as 10 percent of the population were town-dwellers. Additionally, \\"unfree slaves... had long disappeared\\" from within the territory of the principality, wrote Davies. The increase in men allowed the prince to call on and field a far more substantial army. falconer from Peniarth 28 manuscript. Wales exported hawks. A more stable social and political environment provided by the Aberffraw administration allowed for the natural development of Welsh culture, particularly in literature, law, and religion.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Recovers Gwynedd, Norman invasion, Battle of Anglesey Sound, pgs 21‚Äì22, 36, 39, 40, later years 76‚Äì77 Tradition originating from The History of Gruffydd ap Cynan attributes Gruffydd I as reforming the orders of bards and musicians; Welsh literature demonstrated \\"vigor and a sense of commitment\\" as new ideas reached Wales, even in \\"the wake of the invaders\\", according to historian John Davies. Contacts with continental Europe \\"sharpened Welsh pride\\", wrote Davies in his History of Wales.  Economy and trade  The increase in the Welsh population, especially in the lands of the principality, allowed for a greater diversification of the economy. The Meirionnydd tax rolls give evidence to the thirty-seven various professions present in Meirionnydd directly before the conquest. Of these professions, there were eight goldsmiths, four bards (poets) by trade, 26 shoemakers, a doctor in Cynwyd and a hotel keeper in Maentwrog, and 28 priests; two of whom were university graduates. Also present were a significant number of fishermen, administrators, professional men and craftsmen. With the average temperature of Wales a degree or two higher than it is today, more Welsh lands were arable for agriculture, \\"a crucial bonus for a country like Wales,\\" wrote the historian John Davies.Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, agriculture pg 150 Of significant importance for the principality included more developed trade routes, which allowed for the introduction of new energy sources such as the windmill, the fulling mill and the horse collar (which doubled the efficiency of horse-power). The principality traded cattle, skins, cheese, timber, horses, wax, dogs, hawks, and fleeces, but also flannel (with the growth of fulling mills). Flannel was second only to cattle among the principality's exports. In exchange, the principality imported salt, wine, wheat, and other luxuries from London and Paris. But most importantly for the defence of the principality, iron and specialised weaponry were also imported. Welsh dependence on foreign imports was a tool that England used to wear down the principality during times of conflict between the two countries. 1284 to 1542: annexed to the English crown Wales in the 14th century showing the Principality The governance and constitutional position of the principality after its conquest was set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284. In the words of the Statute, the principality was \\"annexed and united\\" to the English crown, It was the king's personal fief. In 1301, this modified principality was bestowed on the English monarch's heir apparent and thereafter became the territorial endowment of the heir to the throne. The rest of Wales continued to be constituted as the \\"March of Wales\\" which remained outside of the Principality under the rule of Anglo-Norman Marcher Lords. Governance The Principality's administration was overseen by the Prince of Wales's Council comprising between 8 and 15 councillors sitting in London or, later, Ludlow in Shropshire. The Council acted as the Principality's final Court of Appeal. By 1476, the Council, which became known as the Council of Wales and the Marches, began taking responsibility not only for the Principality itself but its authority was extended over the whole of Wales. The territory of the principality fell into two distinct areas: the lands under direct royal control and lands which Edward I had distributed by feudal grants. For lands under royal control, the administration, under the Statute of Rhuddlan, was divided into the two territories: North Wales based at Caernarfon and West Wales based at Camarthen. The Statute organized the Principality into shire counties. Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire were administered by the Justiciar of South Wales (or \\"of West Wales\\") at Carmarthen. In the North, the counties of Anglesey, Merionethshire, and Caernarfonshire were created under the control of Justiciar of North Wales and a provincial exchequer at Caernarfon, run by the Chamberlain of North Wales, who accounted for the revenues he collected to the Exchequer at Westminster. Under them were royal officials such as sheriffs, coroners, and bailiffs to collect taxes and administer justice. Another county, Flintshire, was created out of the lordships of Tegeingl, Hopedale and Maelor Saesneg, and was administered with the Palatinate of Cheshire by the Justiciar of Chester. Edward I creating his son Edward of Caernarfon Prince of Wales in 1301 (early 14th-century manuscript) The remainder of the principality comprised lands which Edward I had granted to supporters shortly after the completion of the conquest in 1284, and which, in practice, became Marcher lordships: for example, the lordship of Denbigh granted to the Earl of Lincoln and the lordship of Powys granted to Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, who became Owen de la Pole. These lands after 1301 were held as tenants-in-chief of the Principality of Wales, rather than from the Crown directly, but were, for all practical purposes, not part of the principality. Law The Statute of Rhuddlan introduced English common law to the principality, albeit with some local variation. Criminal law became entirely based on common law: the Statute stated that \\"in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies ‚Äì we will that they shall use the laws of England\\". However, Welsh law continued to be used in civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance, which Welsh law had allowed them to do. Plantagenet and Tudor Princes From 1301, the Plantagenet (and later, Tudor) English kings gave their heir apparent, if he was the king's son or grandson, the lands and title of \\"Prince of Wales\\". The one exception was Edward II's son, Edward of Windsor, who later became Edward III. Upon the heir's accession to the throne, the lands and title merged in the Crown. The first \\"English\\" Prince of Wales was Edward I's son, Edward of Caernarfon. A late 16th-century story claimed that Edward I gave him the title following his declaration to the Welsh that there would be a Prince of Wales \\"that was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English\\": Edward was born at Caernarfon Castle and, in common with rest of the English ruling elite, spoke French. However, there seems to be no basis for the story. On 7 February 1301, the king granted to Edward all the lands under royal control in Wales, mainly the territory of the former Principality. Although the documents granting the land made no reference to the title \\"Prince of Wales\\", it seems likely that Edward was invested with it at the same time, since, within a month of the grant, he was referred to as the \\"Prince of Wales\\" in official documents. Arms of the Black Prince, Prince of Wales 1343‚Äì1376. The arms are the origin of the modern insignia of the Prince of Wales's feathers The following received the title while the Principality was in existence: *Edward of Caernarfon, later Edward II (Prince from 1301 until he became King in 1307) *Edward of Woodstock, the Black Prince (Prince from 1343 to his death in 1376) *Richard of Bordeaux, later Richard II (Prince from 1376 until he became King in 1377) *Henry of Monmouth, later Henry V (Prince from 1399 until he became King in 1413) *Edward of Westminster (Prince from 1454 until his death in 1471) *Edward of the Sanctuary, later Edward V (Prince from 1471 until he became King in 1483) *Edward of Middleham (Prince from 1483 to his death in 1484) *Arthur Tudor (Prince from 1489 to his death in 1502) *Henry Tudor, later Henry VIII (Prince from 1504 until he became King in 1509, the last Prince of Wales created prior to 1542) Welsh claimants to the title Two rebellions occurred during the period in support of Welsh claimants to the title of Prince of Wales. = Owain Lawgoch 1372‚Äì78 = Owain was the great-nephew of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Dafydd ap Gruffudd. He claimed the title in exile in France and loyalists revolted in his name across Wales. He was assassinated before being able to return to Wales to lead them. = Owain Glynd≈µr 1400‚Äìc. 1415 = Banner of Owain Glynd≈µr. Arms: Quarterly or and gules, four lions rampant armed and langued azure counterchanged. Crest. A dragon, or wyvern, gules. Mantling. Red lined white.A European Armourial; Historic Heraldry of Britain; Heraldry, Sources, Symbols and Meanings; Military Modelling; Knights in Armour. Y Ddraig Aur (The Gold Dragon), c. 1400 ‚Äì c. 1416, the royal standard of Owain Glynd≈µr, Prince of Wales, famously raised over Caernarfon during the Battle of Tuthill in 1401 against the English. It is evident in Glynd≈µr's privy seals that his gold dragon had two legs. Glynd≈µr was crowned at Machynlleth in 1404 during a revolt against Henry IV of England. He claimed descent from Rhodri Mawr through the House of Powys Fadog. He went on to establish diplomatic relations with foreign powers and liberated Wales from English rule. He was ultimately unsuccessful and was driven to the mountains where he led a guerrilla war. When and where he died is not known, but it is believed he died disguised as a friar in the company of his daughter, Alys, at Monnington Straddle in Herefordshire. After 1542: union with England The Principality of Wales came to an end as a legally defined territory with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542. Later administration The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes that the Council of Wales and the Marches was created by Edward IV in 1471 as a household institution to manage the Prince of Wales's lands and finances. In 1473 it was enlarged and given the additional duty of maintaining law and order in the Principality and the Marches of Wales. Its meetings appear to have been intermittent, but it was revived by Henry VII for his heir, Prince Arthur. The Council was placed on a statutory basis in 1543 and played a central role in co-ordinating law and administration. It declined in the early 17th century and was abolished by Parliament in 1641. It was revived at the Restoration before being finally abolished in 1689. From 1689 to 1948 there was no differentiation between the government of England and government in Wales. All laws relating to England included Wales and Wales was considered by the British Government as an indivisible part of England within the United Kingdom. The first piece of legislation to relate specifically to Wales was the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881. A further exception was the Welsh Church Act 1914, which disestablished the Church in Wales (which had formerly been part of the Church of England) in 1920. In 1948 the practice was established that all laws passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom were designated as applicable to either \\"England and Wales\\" or \\"Scotland\\", thus returning a legal identity to Wales which had not existed for hundreds of years following the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707. Also in 1948 a new Council for Wales was established as a parliamentary committee. In 1964 the Welsh Office was established, based in London, to oversee and recommend improvements to the application of laws in Wales. This situation would continue until the devolution of government in Wales and the establishment of the autonomous National Assembly for Wales in 1998. Other uses of the term Although no principality has ever been created that covers Wales as a whole, the term \\"Principality\\" has been occasionally used since the sixteenth century as a synonym for Wales. For instance, the first atlas of Wales, by Thomas Taylor in 1718, was titled The Principality of Wales exactly described ..., and the term is still used by such publications as Burke's Landed Gentry.[Burke‚Äôs Landed Gentry: The Principality of Wales and The North West] Publications such as Lewis's A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, and Welsh newspapers in the 19th century commonly used the term. In modern times, however, The Guardian style guide advises writers to \\"avoid the word 'principality in relation to Wales. The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) has defined Wales as a \\"country\\" rather than a \\"principality\\" since 2011, following a recommendation by the British Standards Institute and the Welsh Government. The use of the term to refer to the territory of Wales should be distinguished from its use to refer to the title of Prince of Wales, which has been traditionally granted (together with the title Duke of Cornwall and various Scottish titles) to the heir apparent of the reigning monarch. It confers no responsibility for government in Wales, and has no constitutional meaning. Plaid Cymru are in favour of scrapping the title altogether. The Honours of the Principality of Wales are the Crown Jewels used at the investiture of Princes of Wales.

Load-balanced switches are a subject of research for large routers scaled past the point of practical central arbitration. Introduction Internet routers are typically built using line cards connected with a switch. Routers supporting moderate total bandwidth may use a bus as their switch, but high bandwidth routers typically use some sort of crossbar interconnection. In a crossbar, each output connects to one input, so that information can flow through every output simultaneously. Crossbars used for packet switching are typically reconfigured tens of millions of times per second. The schedule of these configurations is determined by a central arbiter, for example a Wavefront arbiter, in response to requests by the line cards to send information to one another. Perfect arbitration would result in throughput limited only by the maximum throughput of each crossbar input or output. For example, if all traffic coming into line cards A and B is destined for line card C, then the maximum traffic that cards A and B can process together is limited by C. Perfect arbitration has been shown to require massive amounts of computation, that scales up much faster than the number of ports on the crossbar. Practical systems use imperfect arbitration heuristics (such as iSLIP) that can be computed in reasonable amounts of time. A load- balanced switch is not related to a load balancing switch, which refers to a kind of router used as a front end to a farm of web servers to spread requests to a single website across many servers. Basic architecture 250px As shown in the figure to the right, a load-balanced switch has N input line cards, each of rate R, each connected to N buffers by a link of rate R/N. Those buffers are in turn each connected to N output line cards, each of rate R, by links of rate R/N. The buffers in the center are partitioned into N virtual output queues. Each input line card spreads its packets evenly to the N buffers, something it can clearly do without contention. Each buffer writes these packets into a single buffer-local memory at a combined rate of R. Simultaneously, each buffer sends packets at the head of each virtual output queue to each output line card, again at rate R/N to each card. The output line card can clearly forward these packets out the line with no contention. Each buffer in a load-balanced switch acts as a shared-memory switch, and a load-balanced switch is essentially a way to scale up a shared-memory switch, at the cost of additional latency associated with forwarding packets at rate R/N twice. The Stanford group investigating load-balanced switches is concentrating on implementations where the number of buffers is equal to the number of line cards. One buffer is placed on each line cards, and the two interconnection meshes are actually the same mesh, supplying rate 2R/N between every pair of line cards. But the basic load-balanced switch architecture does not require that the buffers be placed on the line cards, or that there be the same number of buffers and line cards. One interesting property of a load- balanced switch is that, although the mesh connecting line cards to buffers is required to connect every line card to every buffer, there is no requirement that the mesh act as a non-blocking crossbar, nor that the connections be responsive to any traffic pattern. Such a connection is far simpler than a centrally arbitrated crossbar. Keeping packets in-order If two packets destined for the same output arrive back-to-back at one line card, they will be spread to two different buffers, which could have two different occupancies, and so the packets could be reordered by the time they are delivered to the output. Although reordering is legal, it is typically undesirable because TCP does not perform well with reordered packets. By adding yet more latency and buffering, the load-balanced switch can maintain packet order within flows using only local information. One such algorithm is FOFF (Fully Ordered Frames First). FOFF has the additional benefits of removing any vulnerability to pathological traffic patterns, and providing a mechanism for implementing priorities. Implementations=Single chip crossbar plus load-balancing arbiter The Stanford University Tiny Tera project (see Abrizio) introduced a switch architecture that required at least two chip designs for the switching fabric itself (the crossbar slice and the arbiter). Upgrading the arbiter to include load-balancing and combining these devices could have reliability, cost and throughput advantages. Single global router Since the line cards in a load-balanced switch do not need to be physically near one another, one possible implementation is to use an entire continent- or global-sized backbone network as the interconnection mesh, and core routers as the \\"line cards\\". Such an implementation suffers from having all latencies increased to twice the worst-case transmission latency. But it has a number of intriguing advantages: * Large backbone packet networks typically have massive overcapacity (10x or more) to deal with imperfect capacity planning, congestion, and other problems. A load-balanced switch backbone can deliver 100% throughput with an overcapacity of just 2x, as measured across the whole system. * The underpinnings of large backbone networks are usually optical channels that cannot be quickly switched. These map well to the constant-rate 2R/N channels of the load-balanced switch's mesh. * No route tables need be changed based on global congestion information, because there is no global congestion. * Rerouting in the case of a node failure does require changing the configuration of the optical channels. But the reroute can be precomputed (there are only a finite number of nodes that can fail), and the reroute causes no congestion that would then require further route table changes.

It lies about southeast of Lake Sevan and the volcanic field spans the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan (NKR) with lava flows running into both countries. Ten satellite cones and fissure vents lie on the flanks of the volcano. The Porak volcano itself and the third stage has been dated 15 ¬± 15 ka by K-Ar dating. Two long lava flows, one of which 21 km long, stretch from the field north and northeastwards. There are thermal springs in the area, and the Middle Pleistocene Khonarassar fault area lies to the north of the Porak centre. The complex is built on partly sedimentary rock and partly volcanogenic Late Cretaceous and Eocene series with Paleogene intrusions. Description There are four stages of trachyandesitic lava flows, the oldest composing the Porak volcano itself and the younger three derived from cones and fissures. Two lava flows overlay Sevan Lake deposits with thin soil cover form an early Holocene stage. The second stage forms lava flows entering Lake Alaghel and is devoid of soil cover. Several archaeological sites (one of these dated by radiocarbon analysis on charcoal to be no younger than 3080¬±40 BP-3200¬±40 BP) are constructed on the two oldest Holocene stages but not on the most recent stage. Third-stage lava flows run at the edge of one of these sites which was constructed on lavas from the previous two stages, suggesting that the site was affected by historical volcanic activity. There is also evidence of strong earthquake activity 6640¬±90 BP and between 782 and 773 BC. Khorkhor inscription The Khorkhor inscription, in which Argishti I of Urartu records the conquest of the city of Behoura, records that during the siege the town was destroyed by an earthquake and eruption of \\"Mount Bamni\\". Historians consider it likely that Porak volcano is Mount Bamni and that Behoura was one of the archeological sites in the area. The location of Behoura is controversial, however. The identification of another inscription by Argishti's successor, Sarduri II, gives evidence of another eruption of Porak. Older evidence of volcanic activity, including lacustrine deposits, indicate temporary disappearance of forests in the area before 6,270BP, likely due to forest fires induced by volcanic activity. Petroglyphs dated about 5,000BP also portray volcanic activity, together with even older portrayals of volcanic eruptions in Chauvet Cave (France) and in √áatalh√∂y√ºk (Turkey) they are among the oldest records of volcanic activity in the world (these other portrayals related to the Cha√Æne des Puys and to Hasan Dagi, respectively).

Surrogacy is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman (the surrogate mother) agrees to bear a child for another person or persons who will become the child's parent(s) after birth. People may seek a surrogacy arrangement when pregnancy is medically impossible, when pregnancy risks are too dangerous for the intended mother, or when a single man or a male couple wish to have a child. Surrogacy is considered one of many assisted reproductive technologies. In surrogacy arrangements, monetary compensation may or may not be involved. Receiving money for the arrangement is known as commercial surrogacy. The legality and cost of surrogacy varies widely between jurisdictions, sometimes resulting in problematic international or interstate surrogacy arrangements. Couples seeking a surrogacy arrangement in a country where it is banned sometimes travel to a jurisdiction that permits it. In some countries, surrogacy is legal only if money does not exchange hands. (See surrogacy laws by country and fertility tourism.) Where commercial surrogacy is legal, couples may use the help of third-party agencies to assist in the process of surrogacy by finding a surrogate and arranging a surrogacy contract with her. These agencies often screen surrogates' psychological and other medical tests to ensure the best chance of healthy gestation and delivery. They also usually facilitate all legal matters concerning the intended parents and the surrogate. Methods Surrogacy may be either traditional or gestational, which are differentiated by the genetic origin of the egg. Gestational surrogacy tends to be more common than traditional surrogacy and is considered less legally complex.  Traditional  A traditional surrogacy (also known as partial, natural, or straight surrogacy) is one where the surrogate's egg is fertilised in vivo by the intended father's or a donor's sperm. Insemination of the surrogate can be either through natural or artificial insemination. Using the sperm of a donor results in a child who is not genetically related to the intended parent(s). If the intended father's sperm is used in the insemination, the resulting child is genetically related to both the intended father and the surrogate. In some cases, insemination may be performed privately by the parties without the intervention of a doctor or physician. In some jurisdictions, the intended parents using donor sperm need to go through an adoption process to have legal parental rights of the resulting child. Many fertility centres that provide for surrogacy assist the parties through the legal process.  Gestational  Gestational surrogacy (also known as host or full surrogacy) was first achieved in April 1986. It takes place when an embryo created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology is implanted in a surrogate, sometimes called a gestational carrier. Gestational surrogacy has several forms, and in each form, the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate: * The embryo is created using the intended father's sperm and the intended mother's eggs; * The embryo is created using the intended father's sperm and a donor egg; * The embryo is created using the intended mother's egg and donor sperm; * A donor embryo is transferred to a surrogate. Such an embryo may be available when others undergoing IVF have embryos left over, which they donate to others. The resulting child is genetically unrelated to the intended parent(s).  Risks  The embryo implanted in gestational surrogacy faces the same risks as anyone using IVF would. Preimplantation risks of the embryo include unintentional epigenetic effects, influence of media which the embryo is cultured on, and undesirable consequences of invasive manipulation of the embryo. Often, multiple embryos are transferred to increase the chance of implantation, and if multiple gestations occur, both the surrogate and the embryos face higher risks of complications. Gestational surrogates have a smaller chance of having hypertensive disorder during pregnancy compared to mothers pregnant by oocyte donation. This is possibly because surrogate mothers tend to be healthier and more fertile than women who use oocyte donation. Surrogate mothers also have low rates of placenta praevia / placental abruptions (1.1-7.9%). Children born through singleton IVF surrogacy have been shown to have no physical or mental abnormalities compared to those children born through natural conception. However, children born through multiple gestation in surrogate mothers often result in preterm labor and delivery, resulting in prematurity and physical and/or mental anomalies.  Outcomes  Among gestational surrogacy arrangements, between 19%-33% of gestational surrogates will successfully become pregnant from an embryo transfer. Of these cases, 30-70% will successfully allow the intended parent(s) to become parent(s) of the resulting child. For surrogate pregnancies where only one child is born, the preterm birth rate in surrogacy is marginally lower than babies born from standard IVF (11.5% vs 14%). Babies born from surrogacy also have similar average gestational age as infants born through in vitro fertilization and oocyte donation; approximately 37 weeks. Preterm birth rate was higher for surrogate twin pregnancies compared to single births. There are fewer babies with low birth weight when born through surrogacy compared to those born through in vitro fertilization but both methods have similar rates of birth defects.  Indications for surrogacy  Opting for surrogacy is often a choice made when women are unable to carry children on their own. This can be for a number of reasons, including an abnormal uterus or a complete absence of a uterus either congenitally (also known as Mayer-Roakitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) or post-hysterectomy. Women may have a hysterectomy due to complications in childbirth such as heavy bleeding or a ruptured uterus. Medical diseases such as cervical cancer or endometrial cancer can also lead to surgical removal of the uterus. Past implantation failures, history of multiple miscarriages, or concurrent severe heart or renal conditions that can make pregnancy harmful may also prompt women to consider surrogacy. The biological impossibility of single men and same-sex couples having a baby also may indicate surrogacy as an option.  Gestational surrogacy  In gestational surrogacy, the child is not biologically related to the surrogate mother, who is often referred to as a gestational carrier. Instead, the embryo is created via in vitro fertilization (IVF), using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors, and is then transferred to the surrogate. According to recommendations made by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine, a gestational carrier is preferably between the ages of 21 and 45, has had one full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy where she successfully had at least one child, and has had no more than five deliveries or three Caesarean sections. The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics recommends that the surrogate's autonomy should be respected throughout the pregnancy even if her wishes conflict with what the intended parents want. The most commonly reported motivation given by gestational surrogates is an altruistic desire to help a childless couple. Other less commonly given reasons include enjoying the experience of pregnancy, and financial compensation. History Having another woman bear a child for a couple to raise, usually with the male half of the couple as the genetic father, has been referenced since the ancient times. Babylonian law and custom allowed this practice, and a woman unable to give birth could use the practice to avoid a divorce, which would otherwise be inevitable. Many developments in medicine, social customs, and legal proceedings around the world paved the way for modern surrogacy: * 1936 In the U.S., drug companies Schering-Kahlbaum and Parke-Davis started the pharmaceutical production of estrogen. * 1944 Harvard Medical School professor John Rock became the first person to fertilize human ovum outside the uterus. * 1953 Researchers successfully performed the first cryopreservation of sperm. * 1976 Michigan lawyer Noel Keane wrote the first surrogacy contract in the United States. * 1978 Louise Brown, the first \\"test- tube baby\\", was born in England, the product of the first successful IVF procedure. * 1985‚Äì1986 A woman carried the first successful gestational surrogate pregnancy. * 1986 Melissa Stern, otherwise known as \\"Baby M,\\" was born in the U.S. The surrogate and biological mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, refused to give up custody of Melissa to the couple with whom she made the surrogacy agreement. The courts of New Jersey found that Whitehead was the child's legal mother and declared contracts for surrogate motherhood illegal and invalid. However, the court found it in the best interest of the infant to award custody of Melissa to the child's biological father, William Stern, and his wife Elizabeth Stern, rather than to Whitehead, the surrogate mother. * 1990 In California, gestational carrier Anna Johnson refused to give up the baby to intended parents Mark and Crispina Calvert. The couple sued her for custody (Calvert v. Johnson), and the court upheld their parental rights. In doing so, it legally defined the true mother as the woman who, according to the surrogacy agreement, intends to create and raise a child.  Psychological concerns = Surrogate  Anthropological studies of surrogates have shown that surrogates engage in various distancing techniques throughout the surrogate pregnancy so as to ensure that they do not become emotionally attached to the baby. Many surrogates intentionally try to foster the development of emotional attachment between the intended mother and the surrogate child.Teman, Elly. 2003. scribd.com \\"Knowing the Surrogate Body in Israel\\" in: Rachel Cook and Shelley Day Schlater (eds.), Surrogate Motherhood: International Perspectives. London: Hart Press. pp. 261-280. Some surrogates describe feeling empowered by the experience.Ragone, Helena (1994). Surrogate Motherhood: Conception in the Heart. Westview Books. Although gestational surrogates generally report being satisfied with their experience as surrogates, there are cases in which they are not. Unmet expectations are associated with dissatisfaction. Some women did not feel a certain level of closeness with the couple and others did not feel respected by the couple. Some gestational surrogates report emotional distress during the process of surrogacy. There may be a lack of access to therapy and emotional support through the surrogate process. Gestational surrogates may struggle with postpartum depression and issues with relinquishing the child to their intended parents. Immediate postpartum depression has been observed in gestational surrogates at a rate of 0-20%. Some surrogates report negative feelings with relinquishing rights to the child immediately after birth, but most negative feelings resolve after some time.  Child and parents  A systematic review of 55 studies examining the outcomes for surrogacy for surrogate mothers and resulting families showed that there were no major psychological differences in children up to the age of 10 years old that were born from surrogacy compared to those children born from other assisted reproductive technology or those children conceived naturally. Gay men who have become fathers using surrogacy have reported similar experiences to those as other couples who have used surrogacy, including their relationships both their child and their surrogate. A study has followed a cohort of 32 surrogacy, 32 egg donation, and 54 natural conception families through to age seven, reporting the impact of surrogacy on the families and children at ages one, two, and seven. At age one, parents through surrogacy showed greater psychological well-being and adaptation to parenthood than those who conceived naturally; there were no differences in infant temperament. At age two, parents through surrogacy showed more positive mother‚Äìchild relationships and less parenting stress on the part of fathers than their natural conception counterparts; there were no differences in child development between these two groups. At age seven, the surrogacy and egg donation families showed less positive mother‚Äìchild interaction than the natural conception families, but there were no differences in maternal positive or negative attitudes or child adjustment. The researchers concluded that the surrogacy families continued to function well. Legal issues The legality of surrogacy varies around the world. Many countries do not have laws which specifically deal with surrogacy. Some countries ban surrogacy outright, while others ban commercial surrogacy but allow altruistic surrogacy (in which the surrogate is not financially compensated). Some countries allow commercial surrogacy, with few restrictions. Some jurisdictions extend a ban on surrogacy to international surrogacy. In some jurisdictions rules applicable to adoptions apply while others do not regulate the practice. The US, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia have the most liberal laws in the world, allowing commercial surrogacy, including for foreigners. Several Asian countries used to have liberal laws, but the practice has since been restricted. In 2015, Thailand banned commercial surrogacy, and restricted altruistic surrogacy to Thai couples. In 2016, Cambodia also banned commercial surrogacy. Nepal, Mexico, and India have also recently banned foreign commercial surrogacy. Surrogacy is legal and common in Iran; and monetary remuneration is practiced and allowed by religious authorities. Laws dealing with surrogacy must deal with: * enforceability of surrogacy agreements. In some jurisdictions, they are void or prohibited, and some jurisdictions distinguish between commercial and altruistic surrogacy. * the different issues raised by traditional and gestational surrogacy * mechanisms for the legal recognition of the intended parents as the legal parents, either by pre-birth orders or by post-birth adoption Although laws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another, some generalizations are possible: The historical legal assumption has been that the woman giving birth to a child is that child's legal mother, and the only way for another woman to be recognized as the mother is through adoption (usually requiring the birth mother's formal abandonment of parental rights). Even in jurisdictions that do not recognize surrogacy arrangements, if the potential adoptive parents and the birth mother proceed without any intervention from the government and do not change their mind along the way, they will likely be able to achieve the effects of surrogacy by having the surrogate mother give birth and then give the child up for private adoption to the intended parents. If the jurisdiction specifically bans surrogacy, however, and authorities find out about the arrangement, there may be financial and legal consequences for the parties involved. One jurisdiction (Quebec) prevented the genetic mother's adoption of the child even though that left the child with no legal mother.Baudouin, Christine. \\"\\"Surrogacy in Quebec: First Legal Test\\". Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society. Some jurisdictions specifically prohibit only commercial and not altruistic surrogacy. Even jurisdictions that do not prohibit surrogacy may rule that surrogacy contracts (commercial, altruistic, or both) are void. If the contract is either prohibited or void, then there is no recourse if one party to the agreement has a change of heart: if a surrogate changes her mind and decides to keep the child, the intended mother has no claim to the child even if it is her genetic offspring, and the couple cannot get back any money they may have paid the surrogate; if the intended parents change their mind and do not want the child after all, the surrogate cannot get any money to make up for the expenses, or any promised payment, and she will be left with legal custody of the child. Jurisdictions that permit surrogacy sometimes offer a way for the intended mother, especially if she is also the genetic mother, to be recognized as the legal mother without going through the process of abandonment and adoption. Often this is via a birth orderBognar, Tara (November 28, 2011). \\"Birth Orders: An Overview\\" . Retrieved December 13, 2011. in which a court rules on the legal parentage of a child. These orders usually require the consent of all parties involved, sometimes even including the husband of a married gestational surrogate. Most jurisdictions provide for only a post-birth order, often out of an unwillingness to force the surrogate mother to give up parental rights if she changes her mind after the birth. A few jurisdictions do provide for pre-birth orders, generally only in cases when the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the expected child. Some jurisdictions impose other requirements in order to issue birth orders: for example, that the intended parents be heterosexual and married to one another. Jurisdictions that provide for pre- birth orders are also more likely to provide for some kind of enforcement of surrogacy contracts.  Citizenship  The citizenship and legal status of the children resulting from surrogacy arrangements can be problematic. The Hague Conference Permanent Bureau identified the question of citizenship of these children as a \\"pressing problem\\" in the Permanent Bureau 2014 Study (Hague Conference Permanent Bureau, 2014a: 84-94). According to U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, for a child born abroad to be a U.S. citizen one or both of the child's genetic parents must be a U.S. citizen. In other words, the only way for a foreign born surrogate child to acquire U.S. citizenship automatically at birth is if he/she is the biological son or daughter of a U.S. citizen. Further, in some countries, the child will not be a citizen of the country in which he/she is born because the surrogate mother is not legally the parent of said child. This could result in a child being born without citizenship. Ethical issues Numerous ethical questions have been raised with regards to surrogacy. They generally stem from concerns relating to social justice, women's rights, child welfare, and bioethics.  Surrogate Mother  Those that view surrogacy as a social justice issue argue that it leads to the exploitation of women in developing countries whose wombs are commodified to meet the reproductive needs of the more affluent. While opponents of this stance argue that surrogacy provides a much-needed source of revenue for women facing poverty in developing countries, others purport that the lack of legislation in such countries often leads to much of the profit accruing to middlemen and commercial agencies rather than the surrogate mothers themselves. It has been argued that under laws of countries where surrogacy falls under the umbrella of adoption, commercial surrogacy can be considered problematic as payment for adoption is unethical, but not paying a surrogate mother for her service is a form of exploitation. Both opponents and supporters of surrogacy have agreed that implementing international laws on surrogacy can limit the social justice issues that surrogate mothers face in transnational surrogacy. Other human rights activists express concern over the conditions under which surrogate mothers are kept by surrogacy clinics which exercise much power and control over the process of surrogate pregnancy. Isolated from friends and family and required to live in separate surrogacy hostels on the pretext of ensuring consistent prenatal care, it is argued that surrogate mothers may face psychological challenges that cannot be offset by the (limited) economic benefits of surrogacy. Other psychological issues are noted, such as the implications of surrogate mothers emotionally detaching themselves from their babies in anticipation of birth departure. The relevance of a woman's consent in judging the ethical acceptability of surrogacy is another point of controversy within human rights circles. While some hold that any consensual process is not a human rights violation, other human rights activists argue that human rights are not just about survival but about human dignity and respect. Thus, decisions cannot be defined as involving agency if they are driven by coercion, violence, or extreme poverty, which is often the case with women in developing countries who pursue surrogacy due to economic need or aggressive persuasion from their husbands. On the other end of the spectrum, it has been argued that bans on surrogacy are violations of human rights under the existing laws of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights reproductive rights landmark. Feminists have also argued that surrogacy is an assault to a woman's dignity and right to autonomy over her body. By degrading impoverished women to the mere status of ‚Äúbaby producers‚Äù, commercial surrogacy has been accused by feminists of commodifying women's bodies in a manner akin to prostitution. Feminists also express concerns over links between surrogacy and patriarchal expressions of domination as numerous reports have been cited of women in developing countries coerced into commercial surrogacy by their husbands wanting to ‚Äúearn money off of their wives‚Äô bodies‚Äù. Supporters of surrogacy have argued to mandate education of surrogate mothers regarding their rights and risks through the process in order to both rectify the ethical issues that arise and to enhance their autonomy.  Child  Those concerned with the rights of the child in the context of surrogacy reference issues related to identity and parenthood, abandonment and abuse, and child trafficking. It is argued that in commercial surrogacy, the rights of the child are often neglected as the baby becomes a mere commodity within an economic transaction of a good and a service. Such opponents of surrogacy argue that transferring the duties of parenthood from the birthing mother to a contracting couple denies the child any claim to its ‚Äúgestational carrier‚Äù and to its biological parents if the egg and/or sperm is/are not that of the contracting parents. In addition, they claim that the child has no right to information about any siblings he or she may have in the latter instance. The relevance of disclosing the use of surrogacy as an assisted reproductive technique to the child has also been argued to be important for both health risks and the right's of the child. Child welfare concerns also relate to the abandonment and abuse of children that may occur in cases where the intending parents divorce, change their minds, or decide they want a different child. For example, the abandonment of a twin boy with Down syndrome by an Australian couple resulted in Thailand banning surrogacy. Those which deem surrogacy as a violation to the rights of the child often cite cases of trafficking and selling of surrogate children across borders in Cambodia and other countries, leading to statelessness and lack of citizenship amongst other issues. Religious issues Different religions take different approaches to surrogacy, often related to their stances on assisted reproductive technology in general. Catholicism The Catholic Church is generally opposed to surrogacy which it views as immoral and incompatible with Biblical texts surrounding topics of birth, marriage, and life. Paragraph 2376 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \\"Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral.\\"\\"Paragraph 2376\\". Catechism of the Catholic Church. Many proponents of this stance express concern that the sanctity of marriage may be compromised by the insertion of a third party into the marriage contract. Additionally, the practice of in vitro fertilisation involved in gestational surrogacy is generally viewed as morally impermissible due to its removal of human conception from the sacred process of sexual intercourse. Pro-life Catholics also condemn in vitro fertilisation due to the killing of embryos that accompanies the frequent practice of discarding, freezing, or donating non-implanted eggs to stem cell research. As such, the Catholic Church deems all practices involving in vitro fertilisation, including gestational surrogacy, as morally problematic. Judaism In general, there is a lack of consensus within the Jewish community on the matter of surrogacy. Jewish scholars and rabbis have long debated this topic, expressing conflicting views on both sides of the debate. Those supportive of surrogacy within the Jewish religion generally view it as a morally permissible way for Jewish women who cannot conceive to fulfill their religious obligations of procreation. Rabbis who favour this stance often cite Genesis 9:1 which commands all Jews to ‚Äúbe fruitful and multiply‚Äù. In 1988, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards issued formal approval for surrogacy, concluding that ‚Äúthe mitzvah of parenthood is so great that ovum surrogacy is permissible‚Äù. Jewish scholars and Rabbis which hold an anti-surrogacy stance often see it as a form of modern slavery wherein women's bodies are exploited and children are commodified. As Jews possess the religious obligation to ‚Äúactively engage in the redemption of those who are enslaved‚Äù, practices seen as involving human exploitation are morally condemned. This thinking aligns with concerns brought forth by other groups regarding the relation between surrogacy practices and forms of human trafficking in certain countries with large fertility tourism industries. Many Jewish scholars and Rabbis also cite ethical concerns surrounding the ‚Äúbroken relationship‚Äù between the child and its surrogate birth mother‚Äù. Rabbi Immanuel Jacovits, chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregation from 1976 to 1991, reported in his 1975 publication Jewish Medical Ethics that ‚Äúto use another person as an incubator and then take from her the child that she carried and delivered for a fee is a revolting degradation of maternity and an affront to human dignity.‚Äù Another point of contention surrounding surrogacy within the Jewish community is the issue of defining motherhood. There are generally three conflicting views on this topic: 1) the ovum donor is the mother, 2) the surrogate mother is the mother, and 3) the child has two mothers- both the ovum donor and the surrogate mother. While most contend that parenthood is determined by the woman giving birth, a minority opt to consider the genetic parents the legal parents, citing the well-known passage in Sanhedrin 91b of the Talmud which states that life begins at conception. Also controversial is the issue of defining Judaism in the context of surrogacy. Jewish Law states that if a Jewish woman is the surrogate, then the child is Jewish. However, this often raises issues when the child is raised by a non-Jewish family and approaches for addressing this issue are also widely debated within the Jewish community. Hinduism As India and other countries with large Hindu populations have become centers for fertility tourism, numerous questions have been raised regarding whether or not surrogacy conflicts with the Hindu religion. While Hindu scholars have not debated the issue extensively, T. C. Anand Kumar, a renowned Indian reproductive biologist, argues that there is no conflict between Hinduism and assisted reproduction. Others have supported this stance with reference to Hindu mythology, including a story in the Bhagavata Purana which suggests the practice of surrogate motherhood: > Kan(sh) the wicked king of Mathura, had imprisoned his sister Devaki and her > husband Vasudeva because oracles had informed him that her child would be > his killer. Every time she delivered a child, he smashed its head on the > floor. He killed six children. When the seventh child was conceived, the > gods intervened. They summoned the goddess Yogamaya and had her transfer the > fetus from the womb of Devaki to the womb of Rohini (Vasudeva‚Äôs other wife > who lived with her sister Yashoda across the river Yamuna, in the village of > cowherds at Gokul). Thus the child conceived in one womb was incubated in > and delivered through another womb. Additionally, infertility Is often associated with Karma in the Hindu tradition and consequently treated as a pathology to be treated. This has led to general acceptance of medical intervention for addressing infertility amongst Hindus. As such, surrogacy and other scientific methods of assisted reproduction are generally supported within the Hindus community. Nonetheless, Hindu women do not commonly use surrogacy as an option to treat infertility, despite often serving as surrogates for Western commissioning couples. When surrogacy is practiced by Hindus, it is more likely to be used within the family circle as opposed to involving anonymous donors. Jainism Harinegameshin Transfers Mahavira's Embryo, from a Kalpasutra manuscript, c. 1300-1350, Philadelphia Museum of Art Jain scholars have not debated the issue of surrogacy extensively. Nonetheless, the practice of surrogacy is referenced in the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara tradition of Jainism according to which the embryo of Lord Mahavira was transferred from a Brahmin woman Devananada to the womb of Trishala, the queen of Kshatriya ruler Siddharth, by a divinity named Harinegameshin. This account is not present in Digambara Jain texts, however. Other sources state that surrogacy is not objectionable in the Jain view as it is seen as a physical operation akin to any other medical treatment used to treat a bodily deficiency. However, some religious concerns related to surrogacy have been raised within the Jain community including the loss of non-implanted embryos, destruction of traditional marriage relationships, and adulterous implications of gestational surrogacy.  Buddhism  Buddhist thought is also inconclusive on the matter of surrogacy. The prominent belief is that Buddhism totally accepts surrogacy since there are no Buddhist teachings suggesting that infertility treatments or surrogacy are immoral. This stance is further supported by the common conception that serving as a surrogate mother is an expression of compassion and therefore automatically aligns with Buddhist values. However, numerous Buddhist thinkers have expressed concerns with certain aspects of surrogacy, hence challenging the contention that surrogacy is always compatible with Buddhist tradition. One Buddhist perspective on surrogacy arises from the Buddhist belief in reincarnation as a manifestation of karma. According to this view, surrogate motherhood circumvents the workings of karma by interfering with the natural cycle of reincarnation. Others reference the Buddha directly who purportedly taught that trade in sentient beings, including human beings, is not a righteous practice as it almost always involves exploitation that causes suffering. Susumu Shimazono, professor of Religious Studies at the University of Tokyo, contends in the magazine \\"Dharma World\\" that surrogacy places the childbearing surrogate in a position of subservience, in which her body becomes a ‚Äútool‚Äù for another. Simultaneously, other Buddhist thinkers argue that as long as the primary purpose of being a surrogate mother is out of compassion instead of profit, it is not exploitative and is therefore morally permissible. This further highlights the lack of consensus on surrogacy within the Buddhist community.  Islam  The Islamic community has largely outlawed the practice of surrogacy, however there remains a small population of Muslims which contend that the practice of surrogacy does not conflict with Islamic law. The main concerns that Muslims raise with regard to surrogacy relate to issues of adultery and parental lineage. Many Muslim groups claim that surrogate motherhood is not permitted under Islamic law because it is akin to zina (adultery) which is strictly prohibited in the Muslim religion. This is based on the fact that in gestational surrogacy, the surrogate carries the fertilized egg of someone who is not her legal husband, thus transgressing the bounds of Allah as stated in the Quran: ‚ÄúThose who guard their private parts except from their spouses‚Ä¶‚Äù (Al-Mu‚Äôminun 23:5) ‚ÄúWhosoever goes beyond that are indeed transgressors‚Äù (Al-Mu‚Äôminun 23:7). Additionally, arguments have been raised that surrogacy interferes with the preservation of lineage (hifz al-nasl) which is one of the five universals and objectives of Sharia law. For Muslims, the Qur‚Äôanic injunction that ‚Äútheir mothers are only those who conceived them and gave birth to them (waladna hum)‚Äù denies the distinction between genetic and gestational mothers, hence complicating notions of lineage within the context of surrogacy, which are central to the Muslim faith. In contrast, a minority of Muslim proponents of surrogacy argue that Islamic law recognizes the preservation of the human species as one of its primary objectives (maqasid), and allowing married couples to pursue conceiving children is part of this primary objective. They also contend that the surrogate mother cannot be accused of zina because no sexual intercourse with a non-legal husband is required for her pregnancy. Finally, they argue that the lineage of the child can be traced to the biological parents and hence questions of lineage are easily resolvable. They support this by drawing comparisons between hiring a surrogate mother and hiring a woman to breast feed one's child which is an acceptable practice under Islamic law. Fertility tourism Some countries, such as the United States, Canada, Greece, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia, are popular surrogacy destinations for foreign intended parents. Eligibility, processes and costs differ from country to country. Fertility tourism for surrogacy is driven by legal restrictions in the home country or the incentive of lower prices abroad. Previously popular destinations, India, Nepal, Thailand, and Mexico have all recently implemented bans on commercial surrogacy for non-residents.

Biography  Seelye was born September 14, 1824, in Bethel, Connecticut, to Seth and Abigail (Taylor) Seelye. He prepared himself for college, then attended Amherst College from 1846 to 1849, when he graduated. While he was at Amherst he joined the Psi Upsilon fraternity. After graduating, he continued his studies at Auburn Theological Seminary from 1849‚Äì1852, and at Halle, Prussia from 1852‚Äì1853. He married Marilyn Dockfill, who eventually died of tuberculosis. Seelye was ordained in Schenectady, New York, on August 10, 1853. From 1853‚Äì1858 he was the pastor of the First Dutch Reformed Church in Schenectady. In 1858 he returned to Amherst College, serving as Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy until 1890. During that time, he was the President of the Amherst College Corporation, and a Trustee of Amherst College, from 1876‚Äì1890, and the fifth President of the College from 1877‚Äì1890, where he began the nation's first student self- government.Bridgwater, William & Kurtz, Seymour, editors (1963) The Columbia Encyclopedia.

In the year 1872‚Äì1873 Seelye made a tour around the world. While on this journey he stopped in Bombay, India, and delivered a course of lectures entitled The Way, The Truth, and the Life, to educated Hindus. He was invited to stay and work with the Christian Mission society in India, but decided to return to Amherst. He was pastor of the Amherst College Church from 1877‚Äì1892. Seelye was also a trustee of Mount Holyoke College from 1872 to 1895. Seelye was a member of the 44th Congress, from 1875‚Äì1877. By far the larger number of his speeches were upon various questions connected with the treatment of the Indian tribes, according to the principles of Christian philanthropy. He chose not to run for reelection to Congress because he had been named President of Amherst College in 1876. He retired from the presidency in 1890, due to failing health, and died in 1895.

A Republican, he served as member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California's 50th District from 1991 to 2005, and subsequently served 8 years in prison for accepting at least $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors. Cunningham resigned from Congress in 2005 after having pleaded guilty to bribery, fraud, and tax evasion in a widely publicized trial. Prior to his political career, Cunningham was an officer and pilot in the U.S. Navy for 20 years. Following the Vietnam war, Cunningham became an instructor at the U.S. Navy's Fighter Weapons School, better known as TOPGUN, and commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 126 (VF-126), a shore-based adversary squadron at NAS Miramar, California. Cunningham resigned from the House on November 28, 2005, after pleading guilty to accepting at least $2.4 million in bribes and under-reporting his taxable income for 2004. He pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax evasion, and conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud. He was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison and was ordered to pay $1.8 million in restitution. On June 4, 2013, Cunningham completed his prison sentence; he now lives in Arkansas. Family Cunningham was born in Los Angeles to Randall and Lela Cunningham in December 1941. His father was a truck driver for Union Oil at the time.California Birth certificate 41-118503 Around 1945, the family moved to Fresno, California, where Cunningham's father purchased a gas station. In 1953 they moved to rural Shelbina, Missouri, where his parents purchased and managed the Cunningham Variety Store, a five-and-dime. Marriages and family Cunningham married Susan Albrecht in 1965; they had met in college. They adopted a son together. Susan Cunningham filed for divorce and a restraining order in January 1973, based on her claims of emotional abuse, and the divorce was granted nine months later. Cunningham later said that his life hit \\"rock-bottom\\" in that year. In 1973, he met Dan McKinnon, a publisher and son of former Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who encouraged him to turn his life around. Education and military service June 1972 ‚Äì Lieutenant Cunningham (second from left) in a ceremony honoring him and Lieutenant (JG) William P. Driscoll (third from left), the Navy's only Vietnam War air \\"Aces\\". On the left is John Warner, then Secretary of the Navy, and on the right is Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, then Chief of Naval Operations. Cunningham graduated from Shelbina High School in 1959. He attended Kirksville Teacher's College for one year before transferring to the University of Missouri in Columbia. Cunningham graduated with a bachelor's degree in education and physical education in 1964; he obtained his M.A. in education the following year. He was hired as a physical education teacher and swimming coach at Hinsdale Central High School, where he stayed for one year. Two members of his swim team competed in the 1968 Olympics, where they earned a gold and a silver medal. Cunningham joined the United States Navy in 1967. During his service, Cunningham and his Navigator/Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) \\"Irish\\" Driscoll became the only Navy aces in the Vietnam War, flying an F-4 Phantom II from aboard aircraft carrier . He and Driscoll recorded five aerial victories against North Vietnamese MiG-21 and MiG-17 aircraft between January and May 1972, including three kills in one flight (earning them the Navy Cross). In the final engagement, Cunningham downed a MiG-17, which was supposedly piloted by North Vietnam Air Force fighter ace Col. Nguyen Toon, aka, \\"Colonel Tomb\\". \\"Colonel Tomb\\" has been found to have been a myth, loosely based on a North Vietnamese Air Force pilot from the 921st Fighter Regiment named Nguyen Van Coc. He was credited with 9 aerial victories, as well as photographs of a MiG-21 (number 4326) adorned with 13 air combat kills, which had been circulated in numerous western publications during the late 1960s. Like their US counterparts, North Vietnamese aircraft were flown by several pilots within the 921st Fighter Regiment, including Van Coc.Toperczer, p. 91, plate 5. While returning to the carrier after the final shoot-down, Cunningham and Driscoll were forced to eject from their F-4 over water near Nam Dinh, but they were rescued by Navy helicopter. After returning to the US from Vietnam in 1972, Cunningham became an instructor at the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School TOPGUN at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego. He was reportedly nearly court-martialed for allegedly breaking into his commanding officer's office to compare his record and fitness reports with those of his colleagues ‚Äì a charge denied by Cunningham, but supported by two of his superior officers at the time. Cunningham served tours with VF-154, United States Seventh Fleet, and as Executive Officer/Commanding Officer of the shore-based adversary squadron VF-126. In 1985, Cunningham earned an MBA from National University. In 1987, he was featured on the PBS broadcast of the NOVA special \\"Top Gun And Beyond\\", during which he recounted his engagement with the North Vietnamese fighter pilot thought to be \\"Colonel Tomb\\". He retired from the Navy with the final rank of commander in 1987, settling in Del Mar, a suburb of San Diego. Cunningham became nationally known as a CNN commentator on naval aircraft in the run-up to the Persian Gulf War. \\"Showtime 100\\", the F-4J flown for three \\"kills\\" by Cunningham and Driscoll. Political career Congressman Cunningham at TOPGUN, 1991. Cunningham's visibility as a CNN commentator led several Republican leaders to approach him about running in what was then the 44th District, one of four that divided San Diego. The district had been held for eight years by Democrat Jim Bates, and was considered the most Democratic district in the San Diego area. However, Bates was bogged down in a scandal involving charges of sexual harassment. Cunningham won the Republican nomination in 1990 and hammered Bates about the scandal, promising to be \\"a congressman we can be proud of.\\" He won by just one percentage point, giving Republicans full representation of the San Diego area for only the second time since the city was split into two districts after the 1960 census. Cunningham's status as a Vietnam War hero made him a sought-after source, by colleagues and the media, in the debate on whether to use military force against Iraq in the lead up to the first Gulf War. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, longtime chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that Cunningham had considerable \\"drawing power\\" and was treated as a celebrity by his fellow Republicans. After the 1990 census, redistricting renumbered the 44th District as the 51st and created the 50th District, splitting off a significant portion of San Diego County. At the same time, the 51st added several areas of heavily Republican North San Diego County. The new district included the home of Bill Lowery, a fellow Republican who had represented most of the other side of San Diego for the past 12 years. They faced one another in the Republican primary. Despite Lowery's seniority, his involvement in the House banking scandal hurt him. As polls showed Cunningham with a substantial lead, Lowery dropped out of the primary race, effectively handing Cunningham the nomination. Cunningham breezed to victory in November. Even though the district (renumbered as the 50th after the 2000 census) was not nearly as conservative as the other two Republican-held districts in the San Diego area, Cunningham was reelected six times with no less than 55 percent of the vote. Cunningham was a member of the Appropriations and Intelligence committees, and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence during the 109th Congress. He was considered a leading Republican expert on national security issues. He was also a champion of education, using his position on the Appropriations Education Subcommittee to steer federal dollars to schools in San Diego. After surgery for prostate cancer in 1998, he became a champion of early testing for the disease. Cunningham was known for making controversial comments. For example: * Making a comment about gay Congressman Barney Frank, where he called the rectal examination for prostate cancer \\"just not natural, unless maybe you're Barney Frank\\". * Displaying his middle finger to a constituent and \\"for emphasis, [shouting] the two-word meaning of his one-finger salute\\" during an argument over military spending. * Suggesting that the Democratic House leadership should be \\"lined up and shot\\" ‚Äì a call he'd previously made about Vietnam War protesters. * Referring to gay soldiers as \\"homos\\" on the floor of the House of Representatives when he said backers of an environmental amendment were \\"the same people that would ... put homos in the military.\\" Congresswoman Pat Schroeder asked if he would yield the floor, but Cunningham told her, \\"No, I will not.\\" When then-Congressman Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, objected, Cunningham responded by telling Sanders \\"Sit down, you socialist.\\" Bernie Sanders asked Cunningham to confirm if he was \\"referring to the many thousands and thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country? Was that the groups of people that the gentleman was referring to?\\" He later apologized for his comments. After Cunningham yielded, Schroeder asked if she had \\"to call the gentleman a gentleman if he's not one.\\" While Cunningham said that \\"I cut my own rudder\\" on issues, he had a very conservative voting record. He was often compared by liberal interest groups to former congressman Bob Dornan; both were ardent conservatives, both were former military pilots, and both spoke out against perceived enemies. In 1992, Cunningham, along with Dornan and fellow San Diego Republican Duncan L. Hunter, challenged the patriotism of then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton before a near-empty House chamber, but still viewed by C-SPAN viewers. In September 1996 Cunningham criticized President Clinton for appointing judges who were \\"soft on crime\\". \\"We must get tough on drug dealers,\\" he said, adding that \\"those who peddle destruction on our children must pay dearly\\". He favored stiff drug penalties and voted for the death penalty for major drug dealers. Four months later, his son Todd was arrested for helping to transport of marijuana from Texas to Indiana. Todd Cunningham pleaded guilty to possession and conspiracy to sell marijuana. At his son's sentencing hearing, Cunningham fought back tears as he begged the judge for leniency (Todd was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, in part because he tested positive for cocaine three times while on bail). Cunningham's press secretary responded to accusations of double standards with: \\"The sentence Todd got had nothing to do with who Duke is. Duke has always been tough on drugs and remains tough on drugs.\\" Legislative achievements Cunningham was the lead sponsor of the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, which banned the practice of shark finning in all US waters and pushed America to the lead on efforts to ban shark finning worldwide. For his efforts Cunningham was named as a \\"Conservation Hero\\" by the Audubon Society and the Ocean Wildlife Campaign. Cunningham co-sponsored, along with Democrat John Murtha, the so-called \\"Flag Desecration Amendment\\", which would add the following sentence to the Constitution of the United States > The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the > Flag of the United States. The proposed amendment has passed the House many times, but narrowly missed the requisite 2/3 majority vote for passage in the Senate. Cunningham was the driving force behind the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act which was passed and signed into law by President George W. Bush in July 2004. The law grants the authority to non-federal law enforcement officers from any jurisdiction to carry a firearm anywhere within the jurisdiction of the United States. Scandals and corruption Scan of a document submitted as evidence by the prosecution and included in their February 2006 sentencing memorandum against Cunningham, penned by his own hand on his own Congressional office stationery for the benefit of \\"co-conspirator#2\\" (defense contractor Mitchell Wade). The left column lists millions of dollars of government contracts; the right column lists the thousands of dollars in bribes required to secure them. The figures in the right column are increases; e.g. $50,000 in bribes would mean the difference between $18 million and $19 million of awarded contracts. \\"BT\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Buoy Toy\\" ‚Äì a 42-foot Carver yacht that was financed by Wade in exchange for $16 million in contracts. Cunningham renamed it the \\"Duke-stir\\". Allegations In June 2005, a story appeared in the San Diego Union Tribune by Marcus Stern and Jerry Kammer, who would later receive a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting. The story revealed that a defense contractor, Mitchell Wade, founder of the defense contracting firm MZM Inc. (since renamed Athena Innovative Solutions Inc. and later acquired by CACI), bought Cunningham's house in Del Mar in 2003 for $1,675,000. A month later, Wade placed it back on the market where it remained unsold for 8 months until the price was reduced to $975,000. Cunningham was a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee at the time. Soon after the purchase, Wade's company began to receive tens of millions of dollars worth of defense and intelligence contracts. Cunningham claimed the deal was legitimate, adding, \\"I feel very confident that I haven't done anything wrong.\\" Later in June, it was further reported that Cunningham lived rent-free on a yacht aptly named the \\"Duke Stir\\" while he was in Washington. The yacht was owned by Wade; Cunningham paid only for maintenance. An article in The San Diego Union Tribune reported that Cunningham liked to invite women to his yacht. Two of them said that he would change into pajama bottoms and a turtleneck sweater to entertain them with chilled champagne by the light of a lava lamp. The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation regarding the real estate transaction. Cunningham's home, MZM corporate offices, and Wade's home were all simultaneously raided by several federal agencies with warrants on July 1, 2005. On July 14, 2005 Cunningham announced he would not run for a ninth term in 2006, saying that while he believed he'd be cleared of any wrongdoing, he could not defend himself and run for reelection at the same time. He admitted to displaying \\"poor judgment\\" when he sold his house to Wade. Besides Wade, the three other co-conspirators were: Brent R. Wilkes, founder of San Diego- based ADCS Inc.; New York businessman Thomas Kontogiannis; and John T. Michael, Kontogiannis' nephew and the owner of a New York-based mortgage company, Coastal Capital Corp. Property records show the company made $1.15 million in real estate loans to Cunningham, two of which were used in the purchase of his Rancho Santa Fe mansion. Court records show that Wade paid off one of those loans. In 1997, Cunningham had pushed the Pentagon into buying a $20 million document-digitization system created by ADCS Inc., one of several defense companies owned by Wilkes. The Pentagon did not want to buy the system. When it had not done so three years later, Cunningham angrily demanded the firing of Lou Kratz, an assistant undersecretary of defense Cunningham held responsible for the delays. It later emerged that Wilkes reportedly gave Cunningham more than $630,000 in cash and favors. Cunningham was also criticized for selling merchandise on his personal website, such as a $595 Buck knife featuring the official Congressional seal. He failed to obtain permission to use the seal, which is a federal offense. On April 27, 2006, months after his guilty plea, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in addition to all the favors, gifts and money Cunningham received from defense contractors who wanted his help in obtaining contracts, Cunningham may have been provided with prostitutes, hotel rooms, limousines, and other amenities. Plea agreement On November 28, 2005, Cunningham pleaded guilty to tax evasion, conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud in federal court in San Diego. Among the many bribes Cunningham admitted receiving was the sale of his home in Del Mar at an inflated price, the free use of the yacht \\"Duke Stir,\\" a used Rolls-Royce, antique furniture, Persian rugs, jewelry, and a $2,000 contribution for his daughter's college graduation party. Cunningham's attorney, Mark Holscher, later said that the government's evidence was so overwhelming that he had no choice but to recommend a guilty plea. With the plea bargain, Cunningham faced a maximum of 10 years; had he fought the charges, Cunningham risked spending the rest of his life in prison. As part of his guilty plea, Cunningham agreed to forfeit his $2.55 million home in Rancho Santa Fe, which he bought with the proceeds of the sale of the Del Mar house. Cunningham initially tried to sell the Rancho Santa Fe house, but federal prosecutors moved to block the sale after finding evidence it was purchased with Wade's money. (Wade, with others, even paid off the balance Cunningham owed on the mortgage.) Cunningham also forfeited more than $1.8 million in cash, antiques, rugs, and other items. Also as part of the plea agreement, Cunningham agreed to help the government in its prosecution of others involved in the defense contractor bribery scandal. Resignation Cunningham announced that he would resign from the House at a press conference just after entering his plea. In marked contrast to his defiant stand earlier in the year, Cunningham appeared very contrite, sullen and overcome by emotion when he read his prepared statement announcing that he was stepping down: > When I announced several months ago that I would not seek re-election, I > publicly declared my innocence because I was not strong enough to face the > truth. So, I misled my family, staff, friends, colleagues, the public ‚Äì even > myself. For all of this, I am deeply sorry. The truth is ‚Äì I broke the law, > concealed my conduct, and disgraced my high office. I know that I will > forfeit my freedom, my reputation, my worldly possessions, and most > importantly, the trust of my friends and family.... In my life, I have known > great joy and great sorrow. And now I know great shame. I learned in Viet > Nam that the true measure of a man is how he responds to adversity. I cannot > undo what I have done. But I can atone. I am now almost 65 years old and, as > I enter the twilight of my life, I intend to use the remaining time that God > grants me to make amends. Cunningham submitted his official resignation letter to the Clerk of the House and to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on December 6, 2005. Sentencing and prison United States Penitentiary, Tucson, where Cunningham was located On March 3, 2006, U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns sentenced Cunningham to eight years and four months in prison. Federal prosecutors pushed for the maximum sentence of ten years, but Cunningham's defense lawyers argued that at 64 years old and with prostate cancer, Cunningham would likely die in prison if he received the full sentence. Judge Burns cited his military service in Vietnam, age, and health as the reason the full ten years was not imposed. Prosecutors announced that they were satisfied with the sentence, which was the longest jail term ever given to a former Congressman. On the day of sentencing, Cunningham was lighter than when allegations first surfaced 9 months earlier. After receiving his sentence, Cunningham made a request to see his 91-year-old mother one last time before going to prison. \\"I made a very wrong turn. I rationalized decisions I knew were wrong. I did that, sir,\\" Cunningham said. The request was denied, and Burns remanded him immediately upon rendering the sentence. Cunningham was incarcerated in the minimum security satellite camp at the U.S. Penitentiary at Tucson, Arizona with a scheduled release date of June 4, 2013. He spent his time at the prison teaching fellow inmates to obtain their GED, as well as advocating for prison reform. Despite his guilty plea, Cunningham received pensions for his 21 years of U.S. Navy service and almost 15 years in Congress. However, prosecutors were successful in garnishing them for back taxes and penalties. In June 2010, Cunningham submitted a handwritten three- page letter to sentencing Judge Larry Burns, complaining that the IRS was 'killing' him by seizing all his remaining savings and his Congressional and Navy pensions, penalties he feels were not warranted under his plea agreement. Burns wrote back in August 2010, stating that the agency was collecting back taxes, interest, and penalties on the bribes Cunningham received in 2003 and 2004; thus, there was no action for Burns to take. In April 2011, Cunningham sent a ten-page typewritten document pleading his case to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, Talking Points Memo, and San Diego CityBeat. He titled the document \\"The Untold Story of Duke Cunningham\\". In the document, Cunningham says that because Judge Burns has declared his case closed, he was now offering to speak to the media, which had \\"inundated\\" him with inquiries since 2004. According to CityBeat, in the statement, Cunningham claimed that he was \\"doped up on sedatives\\" and made his plea knowing that it was \\"90 to 95% untrue\\". Release from prison Cunningham was released to a halfway house in New Orleans in February 2013. On June 4, 2013, he was completely released from confinement. Cunningham told a federal judge that he planned to live in Arkansas and that he would live on $1,700 a month. In his letter, Cunningham pleaded for a gun permit, saying he longed to hunt in Arkansas. The judge denied the request as being beyond the scope of his authority, citing the law that limits gun permits for convicted criminals ‚Äì a law that Cunningham voted for while in Congress.AP article June 4, 2013 by Elliot Spagat In an interview Cunningham indicated he might move to Florida to write his memoirs. Reactions to the scandal Darrell Issa, a Republican who represented the neighboring 49th District, said after Cunningham's plea that he'd been waiting for Cunningham to explain his behavior \\"in a way that made sense to us\\" and that Cunningham's behavior \\"fell below the standard the public demands of its elected representatives\\". Francine Busby, Cunningham's Democratic challenger in 2004 and the Democratic candidate for the 50th District in the runoff election to fill Cunningham's vacancy, called November 28 \\"a sad day for the people\\" and called for support for her proposed ethics reform bill, the \\"Clean House Act\\", saying that \\"our government in Washington is broken.\\" In an editorial on November 29, the Washington Post called the Cunningham affair \\"the most brazen bribery conspiracy in modern congressional history\\". Later that day, President George W. Bush called Cunningham's actions \\"outrageous\\" at a press briefing in El Paso, Texas. He also said that Cunningham should \\"pay a serious price\\" for his crimes. House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a December 6 statement that Cunningham was a \\"war hero\\"; but that he broke \\"the public trust he has built through his military and congressional career\\". On February 9, 2006, Senator John Kerry introduced a bill, the \\"Federal Pension Forfeiture Act\\" (nicknamed the \\"Duke Cunningham Act\\"), to prevent lawmakers who have been convicted of official misconduct from collecting taxpayer-funded pensions. The bill died in committee. Aftermath * Almost as soon as Cunningham pleaded guilty, Intelligence Committee chairman Pete Hoekstra of Michigan announced his panel would investigate whether Cunningham used his post on that committee to steer contracts to favored companies. Hoekstra said that Cunningham \\"no longer gets the benefit of the doubt\\" due to his admission to \\"very, very serious\\" crimes. * On January 6, 2006 Time reported that Cunningham cooperated with law enforcement by wearing a concealed recording device (a \\"wire\\") while meeting with associates prior to his guilty plea. It is not known whom he met with while wired, but there was speculation Cunningham's misdeeds were not isolated instances and his case would reveal a larger web of corruption. * In February 2006 Mitchell Wade pleaded guilty to paying Cunningham more than $1 million in bribes in exchange for millions more in government contracts. * In March 2006, it was revealed that CIA officials opened an investigation into the CIA's No. 3 official, Kyle Foggo, and his relationship with Wilkes, \\"one of his closest friends\\", according to the article. Foggo said that all of the contracts he oversaw were properly awarded and administered. On May 12, FBI officials raided the Vienna, Virginia, home of Foggo in connection with the scandal. In February 2007, Foggo was charged with fraud and other offenses in the Cunningham corruption investigation. The indictment also named Wilkes and John T. Michael. * In November 2010, Wilkes' lawyers filed documents in court in a bid to gain a re-trial that included statements from Cunningham saying \\"Wilkes never bribed me.\\" Cunningham is quoted as saying any meals, trips or gifts from Wilkes to him were merely gifts between long-time friends, not bribes. Cunningham also stated that he had been coached by prosecutors to avoid responding to questions where his version of the facts differed from the prosecutors' theory. Cunningham also denied having made statements attributed to him by federal agents and prosecutors. Notably he denied having sex with any prostitute on a trip to Hawaii and explained that at the time he was impotent due to treatment for prostate cancer. * A special election to fill the vacancy left by Cunningham took place on April 11, 2006 between Democrat Francine Busby and Republican Brian Bilbray. No candidate obtained the majority necessary to win outright, so a runoff election was held. Bilbray won the runoff, narrowly defeating Busby. Bilbray beat Busby again in the regular election in November and retained his seat in the House until losing to Democrat Scott Peters in 2012. * On April 17, the staffs of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Copley News Service were awarded the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for their investigative work in uncovering Cunningham's crimes. * Four reporters from the Union-Tribune and its parent Copley News Service, who had written the stories that launched the Cunningham investigation, published a book called The Wrong Stuff: The extraordinary saga of Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham, the most corrupt congressman ever caught.

He was among the inaugural recipients of the grandmaster title in 1950.  Life and career  Gr√ºnfeld was born in Josefstadt, Vienna. He lost a leg in his early childhood, which was beset by poverty. However, he discovered chess, studied intensely, and quickly earned a reputation as a skilled player at the local chess club, the Wiener Schach-Klub. The First World War (1914‚Äì1918) seriously affected Gr√ºnfeld's chances of playing the best in the world as few tournaments were played during this troubled period. He was reduced to playing correspondence matches and spent much of his spare time studying opening variations. He started a library of chess material which he kept in his small Viennese flat until his death at the age of 68 in 1962. He developed a reputation as an expert on openings during the 1920s and success over the board soon followed. He was 1st in Vienna (1920) with Savielly Tartakower; 1st in Margate (1923); 1st in Meran (1924); 1st in Budapest (1926) with Mario Monticelli; 1st in Vienna (1927) and he shared first spot in the Vienna tournaments of 1928 and 1933 (Trebitsch Memorial)‚Äîthe former with S√°ndor Tak√°cs and the latter with Hans M√ºller; and finally he was 1st in the tournament at Ostrava of 1933. He also won in the 23rd DSB Congress at Frankfurt 1923. During the Bad Pistyan (Pie≈°≈•any) tournament of April 1922 Gr√ºnfeld introduced his most important contribution to opening theory‚Äîthe Gr√ºnfeld Defence. He played the defence against Friedrich S√§misch in round 7, drawing in 22 moves, and later that year he used it successfully against Alexander Alekhine in the Vienna tournament. However, he did not play the opening frequently. During the late 1920s and 1930s Gr√ºnfeld played top board for Austria in four Chess Olympiads (1927, 1931, 1933, 1935), and his best year was in 1927 when he scored 9¬Ω/12. According to the Chessmetrics website he would have been rated around 2715 at his peak (December 1924). Wijk aan Zee, 1961) In May 1943, he took 2nd, behind Paul Keres, in Posen, and won in December 1943 in Vienna. After the Second World War, he tied for 3rd-4th at Vienna 1951 (Schlechter Memorial, Moshe Czerniak won). Gr√ºnfeld was awarded the title International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950. By the late 1950s he was playing very little chess and he mainly worked on his prodigious library which by now had completely filled the living room in his flat which he shared with his wife and daughter. His last tournament was Beverwijk (Hoogovens Tournament) in 1961, where in a field with five more strong grandmasters, he finished with a score of 3/9 (with only one win, against Jan Hein Donner). He died in Ottakring, Vienna on April 3, 1962.  Playing style  He reputedly modeled his style of play on Akiba Rubinstein's and only played 1.d4, claiming that he did not make mistakes in the opening. However, his style of avoiding complex variations together with an essentially drawish nature was simply not good enough to trouble the world's best. He is best remembered for his eponymous defence, the Gr√ºnfeld Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5) and for his general expertise in the opening.  Writings  Ernst Gr√ºnfeld contributed many articles on openings to chess magazines around Europe. Indeed, before he had turned 20, he was already contributing articles on the Ruy Lopez to Wiener Schachzeitung, which was one of the most popular German-language chess publications of its day, and over the next 40 years or so he wrote many articles on opening theory for chess publications in Germany, Belgium, and the USSR. His favorite market was in Bulgaria, though, because they used to pay for his work in food rather than in money! He published several books which were generally well received and he contributed to a seminal account of the Teplice tournament of 1922. Other publications include The Queen's Pawn Game and the Queen's Gambit Declined (1924) and Taschenbuch der Eroffnungen im Schach (1953).  References  *  External links  * Kmoch, Hans (2004).

The company rose quickly to prominence and was noted for its polished, high-budget approach to packaging and advertising (at a time when this was not commonplace in the British software industry), as well as its self-promotion and ambition. Following Imagine's high-profile demise under mounting debts in 1984, the name was bought and used as a label by Ocean Software until the late 1980s. History=Founding and early success Imagine Software was founded in 1982 by former members of Bug-Byte including Mark Butler, David Lawson and Eugene Evans. Butler and Evans had previously worked at Microdigital, one of the first computer stores in the UK. The owner of Microdigital, Bruce Everiss, was invited to join the company to run the company day-to-day and run the PR department. Imagine Software produced several very successful games, including Arcadia for the Vic 20 and ZX Spectrum, throughout 1982 and 1983, but some games shipped with serious, game- breaking bugs. The company grew in size through this period, at one point employing upwards of 80 people, a large number for its time, and splashed out large sums of money on company cars and the founding of a racing team to race in the Isle of Man TT race. Financial troubles and demise Rumours of Imagine's financial situation began to circulate in December 1983 following the revelations that an estimated ¬£50,000 of its advertising bills had not been paid. The following year the debts mounted, with further advertising and tape duplication bills going unpaid, and Imagine was forced to sell the rights to its games to Beau Jolly in order to raise money. The company then achieved nationwide notoriety when it was filmed the following year by a BBC documentary crew while in the process of going spectacularly bust. Mark Butler also made an appearance on Thames Television's Daytime programme in 1984, talking about his experience of having been a millionaire who lost his money at a young age. On the 28 June 1984 a writ was issued against Imagine by VNU Business Press for money owed for advertising in Personal Computer Games magazine, and the company was wound up on 9 July 1984 at the High Court in London after it was unable to raise the ¬£10,000 required to pay this debt (though by this time its total debts ran to hundreds of thousands of pounds). Legacy Former programmers went on to establish Psygnosis and Denton Designs. The company's back catalogue was owned by Beau Jolly, while rights to the Imagine label were acquired by Ocean Software, which primarily used it to publish home computer conversions of popular arcade games. The final game bearing the Imagine name was released in 1989. In other media The Black Mirror interactive film Bandersnatch, released in 2018, alludes to Imagine Software and the failed work to produce Bandersnatch. The film starts on 9 July 1984, the date of Imagine's closure, and includes a shot of the cover of Crash reporting on the closure. Within the film, the fictional software company Tuckersoft, which had developed both Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum games, places its financial future on the attempt to produce Bandersnatch, and in some scenarios falls into bankruptcy after the game fails to appear. Megagames Imagine had intended to develop six so-called \\"Megagames\\", the most well-known of which were Psyclapse and Bandersnatch. These games were designed to push the boundaries of the hardware of the time, even to the extent that they were intended to be released with a hardware add-on which would have increased the capabilities of the computer, as well as guarding against piracy. The games were advertised heavily and would have retailed at around ¬£30 - an expensive price tag when the average price of a game at the time was ¬£7.20 - but Imagine's collapse meant that they remained vaporware and never saw the light of day. During the BBC documentary it was revealed that the game Psyclapse was little more than a paper sketch, though the name was later used for a sub-label of Psygnosis. Bandersnatch was subsequently acquired and completed by another company, Finchspeed. It was eventually released under a different name, Brataccas, for the 16-bit Atari ST, Amiga and Macintosh formatshttp://www.edge-online.com/features/making- bandersnatch?page=2 by Psygnosis.

The credit is often linked to the number of dependent children a taxpayer has and sometimes the taxpayer's income level. For example, in the United States, only families making less than $400,000 per year may claim the full CTC. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the tax credit is only available for families making less than ¬£42,000 per year. Germany Germany has a programme called the which functions as a tax credit. The child allowance is an allowance in German tax law, which a certain amount of money is tax-free in the taxation of parents. In the income tax fee paid, child benefit and tax savings through the child tax credit are compared against each other, and the parents pay whichever results in the lesser amount of tax. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, a family with children and an income below about ¬£32,200 could claim child tax credit on top of child benefit. The tax credit is \\"non-wastable\\" - it is paid whether or not the family has a net tax liability - and is paid in or out of work. Higher rates are paid for disabled children. It is integrated with the working tax credit, which also provides support for childcare costs. All taxable income is tested for the credit, so a couple who both work and have children, will have both salaries taken into account. Tax Credits may be capped which it is claimed could affect the poorest families disproportionately. On Monday 26 October 2015, the House of Lords voted for Labour Party proposals for financial redress to those affected by reduced entitlements. Since 2018 Child tax credit has been replaced by Universal Credit for most people. United States There are several different tax credits an American taxpayer can claim. (Tax credits work differently than tax deductions.) One of the most common is the child tax credit (CTC), provided by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 24. The CTC is believed to have lifted about 3 million children out of poverty in 2016.  Changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), with efforts led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ivanka Trump, made three major changes to the CTC: It (1) doubled the amount per qualifying child, rising from $1,000 to $2,000; (2) made up to $1,400 of the credit refundable; and (3) increased income thresholds to make the CTC available to more families. The child tax credit is available to taxpayers who have a \\"qualifying child.\\" A person is a \\"qualifying child\\" if he or she has not attained the age of 17 by the end of the taxable year and meets the requirements of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c). In general, a qualifying child is any individual for whom the taxpayer can claim a dependency exemption and who is the taxpayer's son or daughter (or descendant of either), stepson or stepdaughter (or descendant of either), or eligible foster child. For unmarried couples or married couples filing separately, a qualifying child will be treated as such for the purpose of the CTC for the taxpayer who is the child's parent, or if not a parent, the taxpayer with the highest adjusted gross income (AGI) for the taxable year in accordance with 26 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c)(4)(A). Since 2018, the CTC is $2,000 per qualifying child. When first introduced in 1998, the per-child amount was originally capped at $400, and then at $500 in 1999, by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) would have gradually increased the cap from $600 in 2001 to $1,000 in 2010, before reverting to $500. However, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) increased the amount to $1,000 for 2003 and 2004. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended this amount through 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended this $1,000 cap through the end of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the $1,000 cap permanent. The CTC is refundable for those who meet certain income requirements and whose credit values exceed their tax liabilities. When a taxpayer credit value exceeds his or her tax liability, the taxpayer is eligible for the additional child tax credit (ACTC), which is calculated as 15% of the taxpayer's AGI in excess of $2,500, with the refund value capped at $1,400. Prior to 2018, the full CTC was only available to single parents making less than $75,000 and families making less than $110,000 per year. The TCJA dramatically increased these income thresholds to $200,000 for single parents and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. Above these limits, the CTC is phased out at the rate of $50 for each additional $1,000 (or portion of $1,000) earned.  Expansion Proposals: American Family Act of 2019  In recent years, some lawmakers have pushed for expansions of the child tax credit, one proposal being the American Family Act of 2019. According to Smith and Viard of the American Enterprise Institute, this act would increase the child tax credit's refundable portion to $3,600 per child under age six and to $3,000 per child age six to 16. The Tax Policy Center estimated that this expansion of the child tax credit would decrease tax revenues by approximately $100 billion annually.  Other Dependent Credits  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also created an additional dependent credit, allowing families to claim an additional $500 for aging parent and older child requiring special care. The child and dependent care credit allows eligible taxpayers to deduct $3,000 per child for certain childcare services, capped at a total of $6,000 annually per taxpayer.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 13, 2005. It guest stars 50 Cent as himself, and Dana Gould as Barney Fife. Boots Riley of the rap group The Coup provided the score, although he did not write any lyrics. Plot After Santa's Little Helper swallows the TV remote while Homer watches the TV, he ends up changing the channel every time he barks. While the dog escapes and Homer chases him, Bart sees a commercial about a rap concert held by a hip hop artist named \\"Alcatraaz\\". He asks for Homer's permission, he nonchalantly agrees when Bart says he will pay for the ticket himself. However, as he tries to leave for the concert, Marge is infuriated and forbids him from going; and Homer is forced to agree with her, to the point of singing a rap song with Marge about Bart's immaturity, much to his distress. Since Bart paid for the ticket, he sneaks out of his bedroom window to attend the concert. During the concert, Alcatraaz drops his microphone, which lands in Bart's hands, he therefore challenges him to a rap battle. Bart does an impromptu energetic rap, winning the battle, and gets a ride home from the concert with Alcatraaz in his limo, meeting 50 Cent on the way. After being dropped off at home, he overhears Marge and Homer who are angry at him for disobeying them and going to the concert. To avoid his punishment, he fakes being kidnapped, writing a ransom note, and goes on the run. Homer and Marge are devastated and the next day, the \\"kidnapping\\" is covered by the media. Chief Wiggum vows to solve the case, but is made fun of by everyone due to his reputation as a bad cop. When Bart meets Milhouse and explains that he needs a place to stay until the heat dies down, Milhouse lets him squat at his dad Kirk's apartment. As a joke, Bart calls the Simpson house impersonating the kidnapper, which is being recorded by Wiggum. When he hears how sad Marge is without him, Bart talks to her as himself and tries to reassure her, but is forced to cut the call short when the popcorn he is using begins to explode and Kirk arrives home. Wiggum, determined to redeem himself, deduces Bart's location from the popcorn brand from the phone call, and arrests Kirk for the \\"kidnapping\\", and is subsequently promoted to police commissioner. After seeing how badly Milhouse has been affected by his father's arrest, Bart confesses his hoax to Wiggum, who convinces him to keep it secret by showing him that Kirk is far better off in prison, due to having both regular meals and the admiration of numerous women as a result of being a convicted felon. Lisa figures out the truth after discovering a sweater from the concert near Bart's treehouse, but upon showing Homer the evidence, he destroys it, having made a deal with Hollywood regarding the rights to Bart's story. Undeterred, Lisa and Principal Skinner travel to the home of Alcatraaz, where they find footage of Bart at the concert. Moments later, Homer, Wiggum and Bart show up and try to convince Lisa to abandon her attempts at exposing them, on the basis that no one has been hurt over the lie, but Homer inadvertently knocks over Alcatraaz's flat-screen TV. Alcatraaz suggests they resolve the situation by throwing a pool party, to the delight of everyone but Lisa. During the closing credits, Skinner inquires about a job in the hip hop business, but Alcatraaz says he has already hired someone else for the job: Superintendent Chalmers, who, dressed as a rapper, orders Skinner to \\"step off... dawg.\\" As Alcatraaz's group laughs at him, Chalmers quietly confesses to Skinner that he needs the job as his wife is very sick. Legacy Mike B. Anderson directed the episode. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named 50 Cent his eighth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.

The quiz was created by Marshall Fritz, and associates the quiz-taker with one of five categories: libertarian, left-liberal, centrist, right-conservative, or statist. According to the Advocates, the quiz was designed primarily to be more accurate than the one-dimensional \\"left‚Äìright\\" or \\"liberal‚Äìconservative\\" political spectrum by providing a two-dimensional representation. The Quiz is composed of two parts: a diagram of a political map; and a series of 10 short questions designed to help viewers quickly score themselves and others on that map. The 10 questions are divided into two groups, economic and personal, of five questions each. The answers to the questions can be Agree, Maybe or Disagree. Twenty points are given for an Agree, ten points for a Maybe, and zero for Disagree. The scores are added for each group and can be zero to one hundred. These two numbers are then plotted on the diamond-shaped chart and the result displays the political group that agrees most with the quiz taker.  History  David Nolan in 1996 with a version of the Nolan Chart distributed by Advocates for Self-Government. The chart associated with the Quiz is based on the Nolan Chart devised during 1969 by libertarian political scientist David Nolan. Nolan reasoned that virtually all human political action can be divided into two general categories: economic and personal. In order to express visually this insight, Nolan developed a two axis graph. One axis was for economic freedom, and the other was for personal freedom. Nolan introduced his chart by an article entitled \\"Classifying and Analyzing Politico-Economic Systems\\" published in the January 1971 issue of The Individualist, a libertarian newsletter. In 1985, Marshall Fritz founded the Advocates for Self Government. Part of the Advocates' mission was to explain libertarian ideas to the public. Fritz found that Nolan's chart was a great help with explaining how libertarianism was distinct from conservatism and liberalism. He created the Quiz in 1987, and it was the first political Quiz posted on the Internet. The first form the Quiz took was as a business card, with the ten questions printed on it along with the chart. As of August 2004, over 7 million Quizzes had been printed. The Quiz, then, is a combination of two elements: Nolan's chart, and Fritz's idea of ten short questions to help a person find their associated place on that graph. The quiz has also been represented in other forms: reprinted in newspapers, used in classrooms, and recommended by leading high school and college textbooks. During 1993, Brian Towey, with the help of his wife Ingrid, produced a full-color, instant-scoring computer Quiz on disk, for the DOS and Windows operating systems. Programmer Jon Kalb created an equally advanced version for Macintosh computers. Toby Nixon created an ASCII text copy of the Quiz in the era prior to the World Wide Web, and this version was circulated in newsgroups, computer networks, bulletin boards, and on software.Advocates for Self-Government ‚Äì Libertarian Education During 1995, Paul Schmidt created the Advocates' website, with the current interactive version of the World's Smallest Political Quiz. As of November 1, 2013, the online World's Smallest Political Quiz has been taken 20 million times since it was first put on the Web in 1995.  Modifications to questions  Six of the ten questions were substantially revised, or replaced entirely, in 2004. ; Former questions that were removed: * Let peaceful people cross borders freely. * Minimum wage laws cause unemployment. Repeal them. * All foreign aid should be privately funded. ; New questions that were added: * There should be no National ID card. * Let people control their own retirement; privatize Social Security. * Replace government welfare with private charity. ; Revised questions: * People are better off with free trade than with tariffs. ‚Üí End government barriers to international free trade. * End taxes. Pay for services with user fees. ‚Üí Cut taxes and government spending by 50% or more. * Businesses and farms should operate without government subsidies. ‚Üí End \\"corporate welfare.\\" No government handouts to business.  Uses  On August 23, 2000, Portrait of America conducted a national telephone survey of 822 likely voters. Using the same questions and scale, the survey found 32% of American voters are centrists; 16% are libertarians; 14% are authoritarians; 13% liberal; 7% are conservative; and, 17% border one or more categories. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. According to e-mails collected by the quiz's advocates, it has been used in 420 schools in the United States. The online content associated with several textbooks is also claimed to feature the Quiz.

Jewel cichlids are native to Africa. Within West Africa, Hemichromis species are found in creeks, streams, rivers and lakes with a variety of water qualities including brackish water lagoons. Maximum size reported for the different species of Hemichromis ranges from in total length. Maximum sizes in aquaria tend to be slightly smaller than in the wild. Many Hemichromis species are brightly coloured, though brighter body colouration is generally evident during breeding. Sexual dimorphism is limited, though male jewel cichlids are typically more brightly coloured and in some species have more pointed anal, ventral and dorsal fins. In some species, such as Hemichromis cristatus, the females can have coloring as bright as the males. Like most cichlids, jewel cichlids have highly developed brood care. Hemichromis species typically form monogamous breeding pairs and the female spawns on a flat surface such as a leaf or stone. Both parents guard the eggs, and participate in fry raising. Taxonomy H. fasciatus, the largest species in the genus A female H. lifalili fanning her eggs This genus consists of two distinct groups that possibly should be moved into separate genera. The first group, the so-called five-spotted cichlids (including H. elongatus, H. faciatus and H. frempongi), would remain in the genus Hemichromis, while the rest, the true jewel cichlids, would be moved to their own genus. The species level taxonomy of this genus is not fully resolved. Although some of the localized species are well-defined, this is not the case for all the more widespread species and there are several distinct color forms of unclear taxonomic status. For example, H. faciatus of the Nile basin and those in West Africa may belong to separate species, but H. frempongi of Lake Bosumtwi might be a synonym of H. fasciatus. H. elongatus of the Congo River basin and upper Zambezi may represent a species that is distinct from H. faciatus elsewhere, and \\"dwarf\\" populations in lakes Barombi Koto and Mboandong may also be distinct. In the Nile delta, there appear to be two morphologically distinct populations that traditionally have been included in, but might be separate from, H. letourneuxi elsewhere in the Nile system. A comprehensive study of the genus also points to the existence of two undescribed species of jewel cichlids in the Guinea region. H. saharae was generally considered a synonym of H. letourneuxi until 2014 where a genetic study confirmed its distinction, although some have opted to retain the two as a single species. The taxonomic confusion in this genus has been further complicated by fish in the aquarium trade, where there have been frequent misidentification, hybridization between species and selective breeding. For example, the introduced population in Florida, which is based on aquarium fish, was identified as H. bimaculatus up until the 1990s, but likely are H. letourneuxi or hybrids. A similar pattern can be seen in introduced populations elsewhere that traditionally were identified as H. bimaculatus, but likely are other species, especially H. letourneuxi. Species There are currently 12 recognized species in this genus: * Hemichromis angolensis Steindachner, 1865 * Hemichromis bimaculatus T. N. Gill, 1862 (Jewelfish) * Hemichromis cerasogaster (Boulenger, 1899) * Hemichromis elongatus (Guichenot, 1861) (Banded jewel cichlid) * Hemichromis exsul (Trewavas, 1933) (Turkana jewel cichlid) * Hemichromis fasciatus W. K. H. Peters, 1857 (Banded jewelfish, five-spot cichlid) * Hemichromis frempongi Loiselle, 1979 * Hemichromis guttatus G√ºnther, 1862 * Hemichromis letourneuxi Sauvage, 1880 * Hemichromis lifalili Loiselle, 1979 * Hemichromis saharae Sauvage, 1880 * Hemichromis stellifer Loiselle, 1979 Aquarium care Jewel cichlids are neither suited to beginners, nor the usual community tank. Several young specimens may be kept in a spacious aquarium, with stones and wood for cover until a pair forms prior to breeding. Their innate aggression makes them good candidates for keeping in a monospecies aquarium, however this depends on a number of factors similar to all tropical cichlid fish; swimming and territory space, other aquatic inhabitants, diet and feeding frequency and tank layout. Jewel cichlids are omnivorous and will eat both live foods and fish flakes.

It had recreational facilities with bingo and dances, a swimming pool, and a basketball court. However, the complex had problems from its opening. Elevators often broke down, trapping riders for hours. Residents were forced to run fans, even in winter, because a faulty heating system made the buildings unbearably hot. There were also the problems of crime and drug dealing. By the late 1960s, gunshots at the complex were common, and elevators and stairwells reeked of urine. Residents often threw objects out of windows, including Christmas trees. Vacant apartments were turned into drug hangouts, and stairwells became violent crime areas.

If a character's existence differs significantly in the alternate timeline Wanderers TV series, these differences will also be noted. The names are listed in western order, with surnames following given names. Primary characters=Makoto Mizuhara Seventeen-year-old Makoto Mizuhara (Ê∞¥Âéü Ë™† Mizuhara Makoto) is the protagonist of the story. At the beginning of the first OVA, Makoto is to testify against student body president Katsuhiko Jinnai in an impeachment hearing. After school, Jinnai attacks him in an effort to prevent his testimony when time comes to a standstill. Making his way down to some ancient ruins underneath the school, Makoto discovers a mysterious, beautiful woman who sends him and the others still on the school campus to the world of El-Hazard. Once in El-Hazard, Makoto meets up with his history teacher, Masamichi Fujisawa, and after a brief encounter with some Bugrom soldiers, the two rescue Princess Rune Venus of Roshtaria, who had been traveling to learn news of her missing sister, Fatora. As it turns out, Makoto bears an uncanny resemblance to the missing princess, and he's reluctantly recruited into impersonating Fatora. He goes along with the plan, hoping that doing so will allow him access to the Eye of God, which might have the power to return him to Earth. Over the course of the series, he becomes enthralled with Ifurita, and is oblivious to the advances that Nanami and Shayla-Shayla both make on him. After Ifurita is catapulted far away into time and space, Makoto vows to uncover the secrets of the Eye of God in order to come rescue her. It apparently takes him several years to do so; when Makoto appears before Ifurita at the end of the first OVA, he seems to be in his late teens or early twenties. Makoto's journey from Earth to El-Hazard endowed him with a special ability to activate and link with ancient devices of a lost El-Hazard civilization, including the Eye of God and the Demon God, Ifurita. Makoto is notable as one of the few \\"harem anime\\" protagonists who actually becomes romantically involved with one of his admirers. Additionally, in the first OVA he showcases a certain strength of character, also notable among mostly weak- willed, sturdy-as-wet-cardboard harem leads. (Later series stripped him of these traits, returning him to \\"standard issue\\".) Makoto in The Wanderers Although considered more of an everyman in the OVA series, The Wanderers paints Makoto as more scientifically gifted. In the series, he creates a machine in the science lab to be on display at the start of the school's cultural festival, but when Jinnai sabotages it, it creates a portal to El- Hazard, pulling them in along with Nanami and Fujisawa. Because Fatora is not a part of The Wanderers, Makoto is never forced into impersonating her. Enoki Films had planned to give Makoto the dub name \\"Mako\\" in its license.THE WANDERERS - Exciting and Romantic Adventures in a Parallel World Masamichi Fujisawa Masamichi Fujisawa (Ëó§Ê≤¢ ÁúüÁêÜ Fujisawa Masamichi) is the alcoholic, chain-smoking history teacher at Shinonome High School. Fujisawa is not widely respected among his students and has a very strong sense of school spirit. When he crosses over into El-Hazard, he gains super strength and athletic ability; he loses these powers if he has consumed too much alcohol. Also, if he does not smoke for a period of time, the stress amplifies his powers exponentially. Despite his vices, he is a good-hearted individual and a mountaineering enthusiast, which comes in useful whenever there is a mountain or cliff face to climb. He also gains the romantic interest of Miz Mishtal, but he is not quite sure how to handle the attention at first. Fujisawa in The Wanderers Fujisawa does not change very much, but his love of mountain climbing is emphasized a bit more than it is in the first OVA series. Also, he is not a smoker in this series and thus his \\"super\\" state doesn't exist. Enoki Films had planned to give Fujisawa the dub name \\"Mr. Fuji\\" in its license. Katsuhiko Jinnai Katsuhiko Jinnai (Èô£ÂÜÖ ÂÖãÂΩ¶ Jinnai Katsuhiko) is the chief antagonist of the story. Before his journey to El Hazard, Katsuhiko manages to win the student body presidential election by promising student government funds to campus clubs and organizations that voted for him. When Makoto catches wind of this and plans are made for him to testify against Jinnai (who is called \\"Jinnai\\" by everyone except his sister), the egocentric, power- hungry and soon-to-be-impeached student body president attempts to thwart the process by attacking Makoto, intending to keep him tied up until a technicality in the bylaws prevents him from being thrown out of office. Before he can execute his plan, however, he's sent to El-Hazard, and once there encounters the Bugrom, a race of human-sized insectoid beings ruled by Queen Diva. Jinnai's power granted to him by the trip is the ability to communicate with the Bugrom, allowing him to become their military commander under their belief that he is the messenger from God sent to lead the Bugrom to victory. A skilled tactician, he is able to reorganize the Bugrom forces into an effective army and comes close to conquering El-Hazard. Although Jinnai is a power-hungry egomaniac, he's not without some level of humanity. When Galus attempts to stop Makoto and the others from halting the Eye of God's apocalyptic malfunction, he takes the leader of the Phantom Tribe by surprise with the help of a Bugrom soldier. Although Jinnai effectively comes to Makoto and Nanami's rescue, he does so more for the fact that a \\"true ruler doesn't destroy the land he wishes to conquer\\". Jinnai has a very distinctive laugh. Jinnai suffers from an obsession with Makoto that borders of the psychotic. Over the course of both series, he consistently blames Makoto for essentially every single failure and disappointment he experiences. His sense of his own history is a montage of misfortune, the chief architect of which is Makoto. Though generally megalomaniacal, one of his primary motivations in gaining power is to subsequently gain the ability to best, or, even kill him. Perhaps due to his megalomania, Jinnai has tremendous confidence in himself and his abilities. He allows little to faze or depress him, and is quick to bounce back from any setbacks. Even at the end of the original OAV series, where the Bugrom empire has apparently been reduced to himself, Diva and his personal squad, he never falters and instead vows that they will find the ideal place to construct a new colony, building themselves back up into a powerful force. In El Hazard 2, Jinnai discovers a mesa deep in the desert where he declares that they shall settle, while in The Alternative World the colony begins to be repopulated - firstly by bands of surviving Bugrom, then at the climax, where Diva takes the shocked Jinnai as her mate so that she can breed new Bugrom. Jinnai in The Wanderers Jinnai does not change much in the transition from OVA to TV series, either, but he seems to treat Ifurita with more care. Although he's threatened with impeachment from his position as student body president at the beginning of the series and Makoto plays no direct role in the trial, he is paranoid that Makoto will replace him as president once he is kicked out of office. Additionally, Jinnai reveals a softer side at the end of the series, showing a certain fatherly affection towards Ifurita after she stops the Eye of God from plowing into Roshtaria. Enoki Films had planned to give Jinnai the dub name \\"Jimbo\\" in its license. Nanami Jinnai Nanami Jinnai (Èô£ÂÜÖ Ëèú„ÄÖÁæé Jinnai Nanami) is Jinnai's younger sister by about a year. Nanami is highly independent and strongly entrepreneurial, going so far as to take payment from the high school's Broadcast Club to grill her brother over the fraudulent election results on campus television. When she's sent to El-Hazard, she's initially alone and is forced to take on a waitressing job to earn enough money to travel, but she eventually meets up with Makoto and Fujisawa at the Fountain of Arliman, where she is able to start a small business selling boxed lunches to the visiting priestesses. Nanami has feelings for Makoto, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with him. Her feelings also engage her in a running feud with Shayla-Shayla over Makoto's hand. Nanami's power gained upon entering El-Hazard is to see through the illusions of the Phantom Tribe, making her a viable defense against the greatest threat in the first OVA series. Nanami in The Wanderers The Phantom Tribe does not exist in the alternate timeline, and so instead Nanami has the same power to communicate with the Bugrom as her brother. Her past relationship with Makoto is also explored a bit more in detail, and she becomes good friends with Princess Rune Venus. As well, in the last episode of the TV series, Alielle describes Nanami and herself as \\"special friends\\", lending their relationship a certain homoerotic subtext, though this seems to be more along the lines of a big sister relationship. Enoki Films had planned to give Nanami the dub name \\"Nana\\" in its license. Ifurita ; Ifurita („Ç§„Éï„É™„Éº„Çø Ifurƒ´ta; spelled \\"Ifreeta\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide;Roman Album Shinpi no Sekai Eru HazƒÅdo Kooshiki Tour Guide Etranger (Etranger Tour Guide). possibly a reference to an ifritah, or female ifrit) is an ancient Demon God of El-Hazard. Although the specifics of her origin are never explained, it appears as though she is a biological machine designed to look like a beautiful young woman. When Makoto first encounters her under the high school, she seems to know him for some reason, and treats him warmly. However, later in the series, when Makoto and the others reach the Island of the Demon God, he discovers her still asleep, as she had been for centuries. Jinnai uses the Power Key Staff to wind-up Ifurita, awakening her, and because he is the master of the staff, she emotionlessly does his bidding. She has the destructive power to level entire cities, and because of her status as an ancient weapon she has knowledge of all the \\"ancient techniques\\" that the priestesses use and can therefore duplicate any attack or technique that's used against her, truly making her the most fearsome weapon in all of El-Hazard. On occasions when Makoto's power allows his mind to synchronize with hers, she becomes aware that he somehow knows her, despite having never met him before. This leads her to question her existence as a weapon. When Makoto eventually disables the obedience circuit within her, she becomes free of Jinnai's control. At the end of the first OVA series, the Eye of God goes out of control, and she gives Makoto her staff, allowing her to tap into his power to control ancient technology. In stopping the Eye of God, Ifurita is thrown through time and space for thousands of years, eventually coming to rest under what would later become the site of Shinonome High School. After sending Makoto and the others to El-Hazard, she wanders the school, taking in memories that Makoto had passed along to her, and sadly leans against the fence outside the school as the sun rises, when a slightly older looking Makoto appears. After ten thousand years, the two are reunited with the key to recharge her and the ability to return to El-Hazard together. In El-Hazard 2, there is another, identical looking Ifurita, belonging to a man called Yuba, another dimension-traveller who shares Makoto's powers. Ifurita in The Wanderers Ifurita underwent a complete makeover in The Wanderers. The tragic, mystifying and fearsome Demon God was given a totally different personality, making her a bubble-headed ditz along the lines of Mihoshi from Tenchi Muyo! She also underwent a major physical redesign, changing costume, hair and eye color, and facial shape, so that television Ifurita resembles a Japanese high school girl more than a woman from an exotic land. In The Wanderers, she does not become a love interest of Makoto's at all, but stays with Jinnai, cheerfully following his orders - and trying not to screw them up; where OVA Ifurita is lethally capable and efficient, the television version is not only scatter-brained but clumsy and incompetent. Unlike in the OVA, in which she stops the Eye of God after it goes out of control, this version of Ifurita is actually the key that controls the Eye and its destructive power. The Power Key Staff Ifurita's Power Key Staff holds two purposes. First, it is the device used to give Ifurita power, acting as a sort of wind-up key. Second, it serves as Ifurita's primary weapon, which she uses to channel her destructive energy. The Power Key Staff is not a separate device, but rather an extension of Ifurita's own body. Kalia Kalia is a Demon-God discovered by Jinnai in the second OVA. While she seems to share some of the same abilities as Ifurita, her real power is absorbing energy and using it to her advantage. It is unknown if she has the capability of copying the techniques of her opponents; however, she is fully able to collect and conserve energy from one or multiple attackers and reflect that power back at her leisure. Aside from this, she can also absorb and drain energy from living and biomechanical things through the gauntlets on her hands. Her true purpose is to be the control of an ancient El-Hazard weapon called the Trigger of Destruction, made in the Holy Wars as a final act of vengeance by tribes affected by the Eye of God. The Trigger itself is essentially a Doomsday Device, killing both enemy and friend as it weaves its way through dimensions, annihilating anything caught in its path. Kalia takes control of the machine after defeating and sealing Ifurita-2, but Makoto and the revived Ifurita are able to elude the Trigger's defenses and enter Kalia's control room. Caught distracted while attacking Makoto, Ifurita-2 drives her staff through Kalia's activation module and fires, reducing her to scrap as she melts from the inside out. Upon her death, the Trigger loses semblance and is destroyed along with her. Kalia does not appear in The Wanderers. Alielle Relryle Alielle Relryle („Ç¢„É¨„Éº„É¨„Éª„É¨„É¨„É©„Ç§„É´ Arƒìre Rererairu) is Princess Fatora's friend, who is introduced when she returns to the royal palace after visiting her parents and sneaks into Fatora's bedroom while Makoto (still dressed as Fatora) is in bed. When she learns the whole truth, she becomes worried for the real Fatora's safety and assists Makoto and Fujisawa as they travel to see the three priestesses of Mt. Muldoon, serving as their guide. While an intelligent and courageous companion during the first quest, once Fatora returns she becomes a sycophant who even aids her mistress in her schemes to hit on other girls. In the opening sequence of the first OVA, there is a brief shot of Alielle wielding a curved sword, but she never actually actively participates in any combat over the course of the series. Muldoon Priestesses The three priestesses of Mt. Muldoon are sought out by \\"Fatora\\" (Makoto in disguise), Fujisawa and Alielle on a mission from the alliance of nations against the Bugrom, as they are the only ones capable of unsealing the Eye of God's power. Each of the Muldoon priestesses holds control over a particular element and are able to wield their powers at will. Shayla Shayla Voiced by: Tomo Sakurai (Japanese), Mimi Woods (English) At age nineteen, Shayla Shayla („Ç∑„Çß„Éº„É©„Éª„Ç∑„Çß„Éº„É© Shƒìra Shƒìra; spelled \\"Shaellah Shaellah\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is (initially) the youngest of the three priestesses. Holding true to the classic anime redhead stereotype, this tanned priestess' temper is as fiery as her hair, matching her control over the element of fire. Makoto, Fujisawa and Alielle first meet her when she rescues them from a Bugrom attack on Mt. Muldoon, but she runs off with Afura without hearing them out about their mission. When she first learns Makoto's true identity, she accuses him of being a pervert and tries to roast him. But after he saves her life when Ifurita awakens, she begins to develop feelings for Makoto, even though she finds it very difficult to express them openly. She also has a friendly rivalry with the wind priestess Afura Mann. Shayla Shayla in The Wanderers Rather than be centralized in one location, the three priestesses each run a separate temple. Fittingly enough, Shayla's fire temple is located in a volcano. She is just as temper-driven as her OVA persona, but with the addition of being a heavy gambler. When Makoto and Fujisawa first meet her, she had lost her clothes and the entire temple to Jinnai in a rigged game. Note: Overall design and visual appearance of the character Midori Himeno from the PlayStation fighting video-game title Eretzvaju (also known as \\"Evil Zone\\" in the United States and Europe) was heavily based on Shayla-Shayla. Even though Midori's archetype is somewhat opposite to that of Shayla's, she looks exactly like her. And it was stated by the creators of Eretzvaju, that they used several El-Hazard's character designs besides Shayla's as a base to make some of the Eretzvaju characters. Afura Mann Afura Mann („Ç¢„Éï„É©„Éª„Éû„Éº„É≥ Afura MƒÅn; spelled \\"Afrah Mahn\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is the wind priestess of Mt. Muldoon. Of the three priestesses, her personality is delved into the least, and she comes off being rather wooden and serious most of the time, although she does make the occasional crack at Shayla's expense. Even though she is about the same age as Shayla, she's much more calm and composed. Still, she's not above shirking her duties on occasion, as she and Shayla are both late for the start of the rituals at Arliman after shopping at a bazaar, and like Shayla, she fails to listen to Makoto's pleas when they first meet. Afura in The Wanderers Afura remains a studious, intelligent priestess in the television series. However, her background with Shayla-Shayla is plumbed into much more detail, and her personality is given slightly more definition. Not much else changes, though. Her temple is located on a windy mountain peak and contains an extensive library of texts. Miz Mishtal Miz Mishtal („Éü„Éº„Ç∫„Éª„Éü„Ç∑„É•„Çø„É´ Mƒ´zu Mishutaru; spelled \\"Meeze Myshtar\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is the water priestess of Mt. Muldoon, as well as the oldest. Creeping towards thirty years of age, Miz's main concern, aside from her duties as a priestess, is keeping herself looking beautiful and hoping that she'll one day find a suitor so that she can marry and retire. While bathing in the springs of Arliman, a bumbling servant pours freezing cold water on her, causing her to scream, and Fujisawa, thinking she's in danger, \\"saves\\" her from her attacker. Taken with how handsome her \\"hero\\" is (not to mention that he is a teacher with a steady income), Miz instantly falls head over heels for him. Even as the world is in danger, Miz's primary motivation for ending the Bugrom conflict is so that she can plan out the whole wedding ceremony before Fujisawa can even say yes or no. Although she's more than capable of taking care of herself, she likes playing the delicate flower role when wooing Fujisawa. Eventually, she and Fujisawa tie the knot by the end of El Hazard 2, and the water priestess becomes Miz Fujisawa. At the end of the Alternative World, she later gives birth to their son. Miz in The Wanderers Miz is very much the same person she is in the OVA. The water temple she controls was briefly left in the hands of Nanami, who turned it into a water park, much to Miz's dismay. Faces at the Palace These characters are seen within or associated most often with the royal palace in Florestica, the capital of Roshtaria and the location of the headquarters of the Alliance of human nations. Rune Venus Rune Venus („É´„Éº„É≥„Éª„É¥„Çß„Éº„Éä„Çπ R≈´n Vƒìnasu; spelled \\"Rhun Veenas\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is a princess of Roshtaria and Fatora's older sister; she is both the leader of Roshtaria and the head of the Alliance. (There is never any explanation given for why her title is \\"oujo\\" [king's daughter] rather than something befitting an autonomous ruler.) A serious, intelligent and kind-hearted ruler, she sends Makoto and Fujisawa on a mission to locate the Muldoon priestesses so that they can unseal the Eye of God. Even though Fatora's absence renders the superweapon useless, she and the other Alliance members believe that such an action would deter the Bugrom from attacking. She's also engaged to Prince Galus, who supports the action. Rune Venus in The Wanderers Like Ifurita, Rune undergoes a dramatic shift in personality and character design in The Wanderers. Younger and cuter, she's closer to Makoto's age and is made into his primary love interest as well as a much more central character in general. She's also more lighthearted and playful, but still serious enough to be a proper ruler. One particular quirk is her habit of talking to a dragon hand-puppet while bathing. Enoki Films had planned to give Rune the dub name \\"Ruhn\\" in their license. Londs Londs is the chief servant of the royal house and a trained soldier. He oversees many of the day-to-day goings-on at the palace, and assists Makoto in keeping up the ruse of him playing Fatora. It is he who invites Makoto and Fujisawa to the palace after the two Earthlings rescue Princess Rune from a Bugrom attack. Londs in The Wanderers Londs does not change much, but he is initially much more suspicious of Makoto and Fujisawa when they first appear than he is in the OVA. Dr. Schtalubaugh The elderly Dean of Roshtaria's Royal Academy, Schtalubaugh has access to more knowledge about the workings of ancient El- Hazard than anyone else. It is he that discerns the exact nature of Makoto's super-ability. However, he has no knowledge of any ability to cross over dimensions, and thus is unable to find a way to return Makoto and Fujisawa to Earth. He also has hands in ceremonial matters, as Miz informs Fujisawa that he has agreed to oversee their vows at their wedding. Dr. Schtalubaugh in The Wanderers Very little about the good doctor changes, but there are scenes in which he is able to relax and enjoy himself. Fatora Venus Fatora Venus („Éï„Ç°„Éà„É©„Éª„É¥„Çß„Éº„Éä„Çπ Fatora Vƒìnasu; spelled \\"Fatra Veenas\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is Rune's younger sister, and for most of the first OVA, she is in the clutches of the Phantom Tribe, being subjected to various scientific experiments. Although two females of royal blood are required in order to operate the Eye of God, the tribe utilizes a special device allowing them to control it with only her as a key. However, when the machine breaks down, the tribe is forced to retreat, and Ifurita, sent by Katsuhiko, takes her to the Bugrom to become their prisoner. When she's finally freed, she agrees to help Rune activate the Eye of God to eliminate the Bugrom, but Phantom Tribe sabotage causes the Eye to run out of control after they activate it together. Although the members of the palace look at her with love and admiration, Fatora is in actuality a selfish despot. (Alielle, her lesbian lover, is happy to see that she hasn't changed at all after her ordeal.) She shows very little gratitude towards Makoto for rescuing her, instead declaring how he must have a greater appreciation for her station now that he's had a chance to live it. Therefore, she is doted ONLY by the royal members and is greatly disrespected by other parties, including the priestesses and Makoto's party. She is particularly disliked by Nanami and Shayla-Shayla, whom she would often try to seduce. An apparently open lesbian (there is no indication in the narrative that her tastes are at all hidden knowledge), she is much like her primary lover Alielle in that she has an overdeveloped sex drive and little concern for the concept of \\"faithfulness\\" or even \\"disinterested\\". While it's implied that she has had many other \\"once-off\\" lovers in the past, and is attracted to Kalia when she first appears, during her appearance in the series she is fixated primarily on Shayla-Shayla and Nanami Jinnai: even though she knows that the two of them are both interested in Makoto, she still tries to lure them into sharing her bed. Fatora even goes to the extent of using her similarity to Makoto to disguise herself as him to try to take advantage of their crushes on him; while Nanami recognizes the truth and admonishes her, she manages to fool Shayla-Shayla sufficiently that she manages to kiss her, naturally prompting a fiery explosion of fury when the priestess realized who just claimed her first kiss. Fatora does not exist in The Wanderers. Ura Ura („Ç¶„Éº„É© Uura; spelled \\"Oolah\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is a cat and Fatora's personal pet. Unlike felines of Earth, however, the cats of El-Hazard are able to stretch and wrap around humans, becoming a highly durable living armor. Ura is loaned to Makoto while he impersonates Fatora, and the cat saves his life on several occasions. As armor, Ura is at least strong enough to withstand a single blast of energy from Ifurita. He is also capable of limited human speech. A similar cat is seen around Rune Venus briefly, but is not named or otherwise shown again. After Fatora is rescued, the princess ungratefully admonishes Ura and threatens to punish him. When Makoto steps in to defend Ura, Fatora cuts ties with her pet, and the cat becomes Makoto's guardian full-time. Ura in The Wanderers In The Wanderers, Ura is a cat raised in the wilds of a forest. He befriends Makoto and ends up tagging along with him, using his abilities as armor to protect him when needed. The Phantom Tribe The Phantom Tribe is a society of blue-skinned humanoids that were pulled into El-Hazard when the Eye of God was last activated in ancient times. Shunned by the ancients, they live as outcasts and hold a deep-seated grudge against all of El-Hazard. The members of the Phantom Tribe have innate powers of illusion, allowing them to disguise themselves as humans and create environmental illusions such as flash floods that are realistic enough to convince a person that he is actually drowning. They appear to dissolve at the moment of death. The Phantom Tribe does not exist in The Wanderers universe. Galus Although the hierarchy of the Phantom Tribe isn't fully explored, Galus is probably their leader. Disguised as a human prince, he became engaged to Rune Venus at some point before the beginning of the OVA series. He manipulates the Alliance council into unsealing the Eye of God and kidnaps Princess Fatora in order to use the Eye to destroy all of El-Hazard in an act of insane revenge. Cunning and tactical, his hatred for the people of El- Hazard is boundless. Kiriya A Phantom Tribe assassin, Galus sends Kiriya to kill Makoto (still disguised as Fatora) before he can contact the Muldoon priestesses as with his death, everyone will be convinced that the real Fatora is dead. Her initial attempt at his life is thwarted by the appearance of Shayla-Shayla, who creates too much havoc to allow her to properly aim a shot from her crossbow. Later, at the Holy Fountain of Arliman, she disguises herself as a beautiful blonde woman and attempts to get close enough to Makoto to eliminate him. However, Nanami sees through Kiriya's illusion, and Miz kills her. Nahato A young Phantom Tribe boy, Nahato is a loyal retainer of Galus, willing to put his life on the line if it means his lord's plans will come to fruition. Despite his young age, he's highly intelligent, and he typically shows up at just the right time to make things more difficult for Makoto and the others. He closely assists Galus in the project to use Fatora as their key to the Eye of God. Nahato sabotages the Eye, under Galus' orders, causing it to go out of control and threaten El-Hazard when Princesses Rune Venus and Fatora use it to destroy the Bugrom. He is last seen holding a dying Galus before vanishing with his illusion power. His whereabouts after the first OVA series, and those of any other surviving Phantom Tribe members, is unknown. The Bugrom Four varieties of Bugrom in The Magnificent World belonging to Jinnai's squad. The Bugrom tribe is a race of largely human-sized or above human-sized insectoid creatures. Though their origin is unclear, it is likely they represent part of the indigenous fauna of El Hazard, being a dominant species prior to human colonization in the far past. They exist in several different varieties and are much stronger than an average human. Only Fujisawa is capable of defeating them in hand-to-hand combat with his super strength. Although typically rather unintelligent and disorganized, Jinnai rallies them into an effective army, and with the help of Ifurita, they come extremely close to conquering El-Hazard before they are almost completely wiped out when Princesses Rune Venus and Fatora activate the Eye of God. In the rest of the OVA continuity (EL Hazard: The Magnificent World 2 and El Hazard: The Alternative World), they are thus focused on creating a new hive in order to repopulate and eventually launch a retaliatory attack. In The Wanderers, Jinnai and the Bugrom forces are the primary antagonists rather than the Phantom Tribe. The 'primary' Bugrom come in six different types, most of which are taller than humans. Additionally, there also exists Queen Diva (who looks almost entirely humanoid, which may be due to her position as a \\"Royal Caste\\" Bugrom), a very small fly-like Bugrom that apparently serves as a courier, and two creatures that might be Bugrom or merely trained insects. The first of these is a giant, scarab-like beetle that it is used as a flying transport, while the second is a scorpion-like creature that Jinnai presses into use as a living catapult, though whether this was its original function is unknown. Jinnai assembles a group consisting of one Bugrom of each of the six main types as his main squad. In the English-language version, he names them Groucho, Harpo, Zeppo, Gummo, Chico, and Margaret, as a homage to the Marx Brothers and their foil Margaret Dumont. These are the only Bugrom besides Diva to survive the Eye of God being fired, and are thus responsible for helping Jinnai and Diva to create a new Bugrom Hive. * The first type is possibly the 'default' Bugrom, and resembles a four-legged centauroid beetle with a domed, helmet-like head. This Bugrom is predominantly purple in color, except for its chest, which is red. This is the type of Bugrom that Jinnai names \\"Katsuho\\" (\\"Groucho\\" in the dub), and is his primary follower amongst the squad. * The second type is slightly leaner and taller than the first and is orange and black in color, somewhat reminiscent of a bombardier beetle. This Bugrom has a somewhat narrow and elongated head, fitting its general body structure. Jinnai's name for this type of Bugrom is \\"Masuo\\" (\\"Harpo\\"). * The third type of Bugrom is the shortest type, barely being Jinnai's height, and has a \\"hunchbacked\\" body structure with red and blue coloring. This is the Bugrom Jinnai names \\"Namihei\\" (\\"Zeppo\\"). * The fourth type of Bugrom looks extremely human, even having a face that resembles a human mask, though this lies beneath a toadstool-like \\"cap\\" of shell. Colored yellow and greenish- blue, Jinnai calls this Bugrom \\"Ikura\\" (\\"Gummo\\"). * The fifth type of Bugrom is the tallest and looks much like the first, though its squat head is mantis- like and it has a \\"crest\\" of shell on its shoulders that looks like a formal collar. This orange and blue Bugrom is called \\"Tarao\\" (\\"Chico\\") by Jinnai. * The sixth and final type is almost as human-looking as the fourth, though its abdomen is smaller (looking more like coat tails) and it has a mantis-like head and a cobra-like \\"hood\\" of shell. Jinnai names this green and red Bugrom \\"Norisuke\\" (\\"Margaret\\"). Enoki Films had planned to give Bugrom the dub name \\"Insectrons\\" in its license. Queen Diva Queen Diva („Éá„Ç£„Éº„Éê Dƒ´ba; spelled \\"Dheeva\\" in the Etranger Tour Guide) is the ruler of the Bugrom. With the exception of a few features, she has the external appearance of a beautiful woman and is the only fully humanoid member of the tribe, though this may possibly be an illusion, as with the case of the ruler of the Insects in the Alternate World of Creteria. When Katsuhiko arrives in El-Hazard and is brought before her by some of her soldiers, she becomes convinced that he is actually a messenger sent by God destined to lead the Bugrom to victory over their enemies in the Alliance. Impressed by Katsuhiko's ability to mobilize the troops and conquer nations with ease, she also becomes romantically interested in him. When the Bugrom homeland is annihilated by the Eye of God, she manages to avoid the attack with Jinnai's personal squad by traveling to deliver supplies to Katsuhiko on the frontline. At the start of the Alternate World series, she is urged by Jinnai to produce eggs for the new colony they are constructing, due to the Bugrom having been decimated by the Eye of God ‚Äî Even though more survivors have found their way to the new colony, their numbers are still insufficient. However, much to Jinnai's horror, she needs to have a mate in order to give birth to a new generation, and Jinnai is the only male available at the time (at least, that is what she claims). Jinnai's attempt to escape her is why he and his squad are transported to Cretaria. Once they return, however, Jinnai is dragged into Diva's amorous embrace. Diva in The Wanderers Diva is very much a background character in the OVA, and she doesn't have much more to do in The Wanderers, either. However, the relationship between her, Jinnai, and the bubble-headed Ifurita does take on a rather comedic family dynamic. Also, The Wanderers is the only El-Hazard series in which Diva encounters a human character without a special power to understand the Bugrom language. Enoki Films had planned to give Diva the dub name \\"Deeva\\" in its license. Characters from The Alternative World These characters are exclusive to the OVA series' TV spinoff The Alternative World, and do not appear in The Wanderers. Qawool Towles Qawool Towles („ÇØ„Ç°„Ç¶„Éº„É´„Éª„Çø„Ç¶„É©„Çπ Kwa≈´ru Taurasu) is a young 17-year-old priestess and the youngest priestess of Mount Muldoon ever. She was the top student of her class and took the place of Miz Mishtal after the former priestess of water married Fujisawa. Qawool's servant is Alielle's twin brother, Parnasse. Qawool is also very afraid of insects, which causes her to destroy whatever is around her. Like Alielle, Qawool addresses Makoto Mizuhara as master, because he saved her life and she is also in love with him. At first unsure of her role as a Priestess, her adventure in Creteria helps her gain confidence, and she gradually grows into her responsibility. As a minor note, when The Alternative World was released in North America through Pioneer Animation (or Geneon, as it is now called), her name was written as \\"Qawool\\" and \\"Qawoor\\" on the packaging (the spelling used depended on the volume.) Ostensibly, this was done to make her name sound more native to El-Hazard, since \\"Qawool\\" can be hard for English speakers to distinguish from \\"Kaoru,\\" a very common name in Japan. It may also be an attempt to represent the \\"ku-sub-a\\" phoneme that begins her name. Parnasse Ralielle Parnasse is Alielle's younger brother, who possesses looks and temperaments akin with his sister. Arriving at the Roshtaria palace as Qawool Towles' attendant, he develops a swift crush on Princess Fatora after she accidentally molests him in his sleep because she had mistaken him for Alielle. Arjah Arjah, the prime antagonist of The Alternative World, is a mysterious multi-dimensional being and self-proclaimed \\"ruler of the universe\\" who is trapped within the Spring of Life (Creteria's equivalent of El Hazard's Eye of God, and also a dimensional portal). His background story is unknown, but apparently he was incarcerated during the last time the Spring was deployed. However, Arjah was still able to reach out beyond his prison and into other worlds, and at an opportune moment activates a dimensional transport device which draws the series' protagonists from El Hazard into Creteria. He tricks Makoto and Gilda into activating the Spring, thereby giving him the chance to escape; but the Muldoon Priestesses manage to renew the seal, causing him to be obliterated. Dall Narciss Dall Narciss III is the vain, despotic emperor of the realm of Creteria in another world. In his younger years, when he was engaged to Gilda, he accidentally opened the Spring of Life and witnessed a vision of the time the Spring destroyed Creteria's previous civilisation. Because his bride Gilda had - like him - the genetic prerequisite to undo the Spring's safety seals, he cancelled their engagement to prevent it from ever being used again. After Arjah tricks Gilda and Makoto into releasing the seals, he is critically wounded by Gilda after Arjah possesses her body. However, as the main protagonists return to El Hazard after resealing the Spring, a vision is shown which depicts Narciss having made a full recovery and living a peaceful, simpler life with Gilda and their daughter. Gilda Gilda is Dall Narciss' aide de camp, and a princess from another country who was originally set to marry Narciss since her childhood. However, after Narciss became tempted to open the Spring of Life and afterwards rejected her for unexplained reasons, she became harsh and bitter over the loss of her love. After she sees him apparently losing his heart to Qawool Towles and Creteria falling into ruin, she initiates a coup d'etat to seize the secrets of the Spring of Life and save the country. However, with this action she plays right into Arjah's hands, who possesses and uses her to activate the Spring once more. After Arjah leaves her, she aids Makoto in rectifying her mistake. In a final vision seen by the main protagonists as they return to El Hazard, she is seen happily married to Narciss and having a daughter. Chabil Chabil is a farmer who is first introduced in episode 4. After discovering Afura Mann and the newly-weds Fujisawa and Miz Mishtal on his land, he welcomes them into his home. They are surprised to find Princess Rune Venus is already there, wearing clothing fitting for a farmer's wife. The group is surprised to find her acting in wifely ways, particularly cooking; Miz gets a bit jealous that Chabil treats Rune in a more romantic manner than Fujisawa treats her. Chabil and Rune develop romantic feelings for each other, seemingly quickly. Within episode 4, the two admit their fondness for one another while enjoying a sunset by the edge of a lake, but Rune points out that she has responsibilities she must attend and therefore cannot stay with him. Termite Queen The Termite Queen is the ruler of a tribe of giant, intelligent subterranean termites who pass as the Creterian equivalent of El Hazard's Bugroms. She is an insectoid, but has the ability to assume the shape of an attractive female who shares a great likeness with Diva. Unlike the latter, however, she welcomes guests in her realm either as a food source (if male) or to nourish her young (if female); her would-be victims Jinnai and Shayla-Shayla, however, timely manage to escape her clutches.

A member and guitarist of British band The Cure since 2012, Gabrels worked with David Bowie from 1987 to 1999, and was a member of the band Tin Machine. He has lived in New York, Boston, London, Los Angeles, Nashville, and New York's Hudson Valley. His Nashville-based band since 2007, Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends, features Gabrels on guitar and vocals. As a guitarist, Gabrels is recognized for his virtuosity and versatility, able to \\"explore sonic extremes with a great, adaptive intuition for what each song needs most.\\"Adam McGovern, \\"Reeves Gabrels\\", MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, 2nd ed., p. 466 (Detroit & London, Visible Ink Press, 1998). He has been characterized as \\"one of the most daring rock-guitar improvisers since Jimi Hendrix\\". As a songwriter and composer, Gabrels spans genres. The songs on Ulysses, an album from 2000, range from \\"hard-hitting blues rock to 21st century electronica\\", as Guitar World put it.

Early life and education Reeves Gabrels was born in Staten Island, New York in June 1956. His mother, Claire, was a typist, and his father, Carl Winston Gabrels, worked as a deck hand on tugboats in New York Harbor. Reeves started playing guitar at age 13, and the following year (1971) his father arranged for lessons with the father's friend and contemporary Turk Van Lake, who lived in the neighborhood. Van Lake was a professional musician who had played with Benny Goodman and others. After high school, Gabrels attended the Parsons School of Design and the School of Visual Arts in New York City but continued to play guitar. He met jazz guitarist John Scofield, from whom he took several lessons. Encouraged by Scofield's example and advice, Gabrels moved to Boston to attend the Berklee School of Music. He left without a degree in 1981, valuing nonetheless his experience at Berklee. Career Gabrels began his musical career in earnest in Boston, building on performance experience starting in high school. During the 1980s and early 1990s he was a member of bands including The Dark, Life on Earth, The Atom Said, Rubber Rodeo, The Bentmen and Modern Farmer. Modern Farmer (Gabrels, Jamie Rubin, David Hull, and Billy Beard) issued an album of original rock songs, Hard Row to Hoe, on Victory/Universal in 1993. David Bowie and Tin Machine David Bowie and Reeves Gabrels met in 1987 during a Bowie tour for which Sara Terry, Gabrels' then-wife, worked as publicist. The first project on which Gabrels worked with Bowie was a re-imagining and rearrangement of the song \\"Look Back in Anger\\" and its live performance combining dance, music and projection as part of a benefit for London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in 1988. The resulting score was 7-1/2 minutes long, whereas the song originally ran 3 minutes as written by David Bowie & Brian Eno and recorded on Lodger (1979). Bowie sang, played and danced with members of the avant-garde troupe La La La Human Steps; Gabrels and two other musicians played onstage throughout. \\"We went into the studio to rearrange it,\\" said Bowie in a filmed interview; \\"I like the hard-edged wall of guitar sound that we put into it.\\" Gabrels subsequently (1989‚Äì1993) joined forces with Bowie and the Sales brothers (drummer Hunt Sales and bass player Tony Sales) in the rock band Tin Machine. Gabrels carried on working with Bowie, becoming an essential part of Bowie's nineties sound, most notably on Outside (1995), Earthling (1997), and Hours (1999), the latter two of which he co-produced. \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" a Bowie/Gabrels song from Earthling, was nominated for a Grammy award. Gabrels and Bowie also created the soundtrack to the computer game Omikron: The Nomad Soul in 1999 for the game's French publisher. Gabrels ended his professional association with Bowie in late 1999. His last stage appearance with Bowie was a performance recorded in New York City for VH1 Storytellers. The Cure Robert Smith of The Cure and Reeves Gabrels first met during rehearsals for David Bowie's 50th Birthday Concert held on January 9, 1997 at Madison Square Garden in New York. David Bowie had invited Smith to sing as one of a select group of guest performers at this event, for which Gabrels served as musical director. A friendship ensued, leading to further collaborations within the year. Gabrels and Smith co-wrote a song, \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" and recorded it, with Smith guesting on vocals, for the Reeves Gabrels album Ulysses (Della Notte). Gabrels recorded lead guitar as a guest on The Cure's single \\"Wrong Number\\" and he also appeared onstage with The Cure for several songs (\\"Wrong Number\\" included) on selected nights of a fall U.S. tour in 1997. Further, Gabrels, Smith and The Cure's drummer Jason Cooper (as COGASM) wrote and recorded \\"Sign From God\\" for Orgazmo, a film directed by Trey Parker. Smith and Gabrels stayed in touch, leading some 15 years later to a phone conversation that brought Gabrels on board as guitarist for The Cure, initially as a guest for a run of summer festivals in 2012, after which he became a member of the band. Gabrels was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019 as a member of The Cure, having initially been left off the list of nine current and former members. Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends For his own band, Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends, Gabrels is the vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter. The band came together as a trio in Nashville in 2007, about a year after Gabrels moved from Los Angeles. The main players for seven years were Reeves Gabrels (guitar, vocals) with Kevin Hornback (bass) and Jeff Brown (drums). In 2015, drummer Marc Pisapia, who had substituted when schedule conflicts arose for Brown, became the principal drummer (and harmony vocalist). Gabrels and band performed often at Nashville's Family Wash venue and toured regionally, including a ten-gig outing on a shoestring in 2009 about which the guitarist blogged for an Internet forum run by Guitar Player magazine. In 2010 without any real plan, Reeves Gabrels and His Imaginary Friends began recording songs they'd worked out through performance, even though mixing, mastering, manufacture and release were beyond their means at the time. Then Gabrels joined The Cure, which helped with budget but complicated schedules. In a 2014 interview with the British magazine Guitarist (Nov 2014), Gabrels described the recording process and the unexpected ways the hiatus before release had contributed to the creative process. The album finally came out in January 2015. Meanwhile, the trio of Gabrels, Hornback and Brown played small venues and pubs in England during October 2014. They toured the U.S. in the summer of 2015, now with Pisapia on drums and new CDs in hand, then made a second tour of England in the fall, marking the occasion with a digital-download-only single titled \\"Try\\" released exclusively on Bandcamp. A final U.S. show in 2015 in Nashville was recorded and resulted in an album, Imaginary Friends Live, released two years later. The trio took a break in 2016 while The Cure was on a world tour, then picked up again with three U.S. outings in July 2017, October 2017 and March 2018. Solo recordings Reeves Gabrels has produced six albums as principal songwriter, vocalist, guitarist and bandleader. As Reeves Gabrels, he released The Sacred Squall of Now (Rounder/Upstart, 1995); Ulysses (Della Notte) (Emagine, 2000); live...late...loud (Myth Music, 2003); and Rockonica (Myth Music/Favored Nations/Sony, 2005). Ulysses was nominated for a Yahoo! Internet Award in 1999 as a then-pathbreaking Internet release, before becoming available the following year on CD. One Ulysses song, \\"Jewel,\\" features vocal and instrumental performances by David Bowie, Dave Grohl and Frank Black. Gabrels made both Rockonica and live...late...loud in Los Angeles with musical friends there including Paul Ill (bass), Brock Avery (drums) and Greg McMullen (pedal steel guitar). A fifth album, with Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends as artist name and title, came out digitally in January, 2015 at Bandcamp and on CD (plus more digital distributors) on Friday, July 17, 2015. Reeves Gabrels & Rob Stennett were co-producers. The songs include originals and covers, with Gabrels singing, playing guitar and leading the band, a power trio with Kevin Hornback on bass and Jeff Brown on drums. Guest musicians also appear, including the band's current drummer Marc Pisapia singing background vocals. Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends received a first print review in the American monthly Vintage Guitar (June 2015). Imaginary Friends Live, Gabrels' sixth album, came out on Bandcamp on October 1, 2017 and remains a download-only release. It was recorded on a single night during a live performance in December 2015 at The Family Wash/Garage Coffee's relocated premises on Main Street in East Nashville, Tennessee. The live album was cited as one of 13 \\"Top Records of 2017\\" by Michael Ross in Guitar Moderne. It was also picked for the \\"Best Music of 2017\\" by the editors of Premier Guitar. PG senior editor Ted Drozdowski's description: \\"Reeves Gabrels, Imaginary Friends Live: In which Gabrels rewrites the rock guitar bible in 11 live performances packed with so much invention it's head spinning. I was at Nashville's Family Wash the night this set was recorded, but it wasn't until I heard it here that my mind was entirely blown by the former Bowie/current Cure axe-destroyer's execution. Every song is packed with 'holy fuck' qualities: epic tones, killer riffs, brilliantly tossed-off fills and digressions, and solos that soothe, stun, and drip with lysergic intelligence. Raw and impeccable at the same time. If you dig rock guitar that straddles the trad and the rad with absolute authority, this is an essential album. No bullshit!\\" Soundtracks Gabrels has written soundtracks for films including David Sutherland's The Farmer's Wife (premiered on PBS September, 1998) and for PBS productions, and collaborated with Public Enemy on the song \\"Go Cat Go\\" for the Spike Lee film He Got Game (soundtrack, Def Jam, 1998). He wrote the \\"club music\\" portions of the soundtrack for the video game Deus Ex. Performing and recording with others Gabrels from time to time toured as a guitarist in a supporting role, for example in late 1993/early 1994 as guitarist for solo performances by singer Paul Rodgers, and outings in 2009 with New York-based punk band Jeebus. Galore, a 1998 album by singer-songwriter Jeffrey Gaines features Reeves Gabrels on guitar alongside Bowie bandmates Gail Ann Dorsey and Zachary Alford. In Los Angeles from 2000 to 2005, beyond work on his own music live and recorded, Gabrels collaborated with Southern California musicians in varied genres. For the soulful, funky blues-rock of singer and keyboard player Gerard \\"Gerry\\" Duran, Gabrels recorded guitar on several albums by the band Los Duran. Gabrels and drummer/producer Big Swede, as a duo dubbed Protecto, put out an electronica album titled Sonicnauts. Another recording project into which Los Angeles- based drummer Big Swede brought Gabrels was X-World/5, a Heavy metal supergroup made up of guitarist Andy LaRocque, vocalist Nils K. Rue, bass player Magnus Ros√©n, and Big Swede on drums. They made one album, New Universal Order, originally put out in 2008 by German label AFM Records. It was re-released by the band/Big Swede in 2015. In Nashville, Tennessee, his home since 2006, Gabrels has played often locally with his own band and others. He was a regular at The Family Wash, an East Nashville restaurant/music venue that closed in 2018 but before that had a long run with wide-ranging music programming thanks to founder Jamie Rubin, Gabrels' longtime friend and associate. When Gabrels first arrived, he became guitarist for Brandon Giles & the Tricky Two playing bars and clubs on Nashville's Lower Broadway and occasionally on tour. In 2010 and 2011 Gabrels participated in \\"From Nashville to Norway\\" festivals in Gj√∏vik, Norway, organized by friends from both locales. In 2014 he began sitting in when possible with guitarist Tim Carroll at the 5 Spot venue. At the time, Carroll's band included drummer Steve Latanation and bass player Bones Hillman (who since returned to working with his longtime band Midnight Oil). Several collaborative recordings grew out of Gabrels' Nashville activities. The Magnificent Others features Jamie Rubin's songs and lead vocals, with Gabrels on lead guitar. Sonic Mining Company, a Ropeadope Records 2012 release, is made up of improvisations by Reeves Gabrels (guitar), Frank Swart (bass) and Adam Abrashoff (drums). Gabrels added guitar parts to selected recordings by other musicians over the years, including songs by gODHEAD, by Jed Davis, and by Jenn Vix, a bass player and vocalist from Providence, Rhode Island. Past recordings with Gabrels guitar tracks include albums or singles by The Mission, Deaf School, Sandie Shaw, The Rolling Stones, Ozzy Osbourne and others. Club D'Elf and improvisation Gabrels performs periodically with Club D'Elf, a Boston-based underground dub/jazz/Moroccan/trance/electronica group led by bassist Mike Rivard, and appears on Now I Understand, (Accurate Records, 2006), their first studio recording; the album also features John Medeski & Billy Martin (Medeski, Martin & Wood), DJ Logic, Mat Maneri, Duke Levine, Alain Mallet, Mister Rourke, and more. Improvising in long form, as Club D'Elf does, gives Gabrels \\"the time to meander and harmonically poke at things, make the music interesting,\\" he said in a Berklee College of Music interview in 2012, going on to explain that free improvisation contributes to his ability in different settings, such as on stage with The Cure, \\"to refine that down to opportunities where I can hit that one note that throws the world off its axis for two bars,\\" yet to do so fully within the context of the song and its lyrics. Instrumental guitar collaborations American slide guitarist David Tronzo, a fellow participant in Club D'Elf performances, and Gabrels made an instrumental album, Night in Amnesia, issued by Rounder Records in 1995. The innovative British guitarist Bill Nelson (Be-Bop Deluxe, Bill Nelson's Red Noise) and Gabrels released a quite different experimental guitar-duo album, Fantastic Guitars, independently in 2014. Instruments Guitars: Gabrels has used different guitars at varied phases in his musical career, selecting instruments to suit the music. He has favored Steinberger guitars, the Parker Fly, and Fernandes Guitars, but also plays Gibson Guitars such as the Les Paul and the Flying V, as well as Fender's Stratocaster. He has often chosen less well known makers, explaining in interviews that he prefers a guitar without a set history and with which he is free to create sounds of his own imagination. In 2008, Gabrels began playing Reverend guitars, designed by Reverend Musical Instruments, now of Toledo, Ohio. Gabrels and Reverend have since collaborated to develop a series of Reverend Reeves Gabrels signature model guitars. The first featured at the winter 2010 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. An update, the Reverend Reeves Gabrels II (RG2) was released at NAMM in Nashville in 2012. The Reeves Gabrels Spacehawk made its debut at NAMM, winter 2014. The Reeves Gabrels Dirtbike, a single- pickup model, came out in July 2017. During The Cure's summer tour in 2012, Robert Smith gave Gabrels his Fender Bass VI, used to play songs such as \\"Primary\\", \\"In Between Days\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Plainsong\\", \\"Untitled\\", \\"Jupiter Crash\\", \\"Before Three\\" and \\"(I Don't Know What's Going) On\\". In response to questions about his guitars, Gabrels wrote several Notes posted to his Facebook Musician page describing the guitars played with The Cure and explaining how he uses them to suit the music of the songs for which he chooses them. Personal life Susan Van Wie Kastan and Reeves Gabrels married in January 2018 in Saratoga Springs, New York. Acquainted since 1998 and partners since both moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2006, they now reside in Troy, New York, where her family has roots and they are near the Catskills where he attended high school. Susan Gabrels serves as business manager for her husband and his band Reeves Gabrels & His Imaginary Friends. Both spouses were previously married and divorced. Reeves Gabrels had married Sara Terry, an American journalist, in 1985. It was through Terry's work as a press agent for the Glass Spider Tour in 1987 that Reeves Gabrels originally became friends with David Bowie.

The Sacramento Solons, a charter member of the PCL which began play in 1903, moved to Tacoma in 1904, where the team won the PCL pennant playing as the Tacoma Tigers. The team returned to Sacramento during the 1905 season, then moved to Fresno for the 1906 season. A crowd of 2,500 (considered large by the standards of the day) greeted the Raisin Eaters for their home opener against the Portland Beavers, which Portland won, 1-0. That was the high-water mark of the season, as fan support eroded as a result of the team's poor play. The Raisin Eaters finished dead last in the six-team league, with a record of 64-117 (.353). The one-year wonders dropped out of the PCL after that year, returned to Sacramento, and re-entered the League in 1909 as the Sacramento Solons once more. Although Fresno would field teams in the California State League and the California League in subsequent years (most notably the Fresno Cardinals) and the Fresno Giants , the Pacific Coast League would not return to Fresno for another 92 years, when the Fresno Grizzlies were admitted to the league in 1998. During the 2006 season, the Grizzlies honored the 100th anniversary of their short-lived PCL predecessors in Fresno by wearing Raisin Eaters jerseys on the field during each Wednesday home game.

Career  He was raised in China's Guangdong province and was affected by Western Church Music from an early age - Yin began performing at age 11, and went abroad to study in Lyons and Paris. At age 20, he was invited to New Zealand to play; he also played in London, England. He returned to China in the 1930s and introduced Western Music to ChinaMusic of China#Western Classical Music as the first Chinese conductor of a Chinese orchestra, when he became employed by Chongqing Symphonic Orchestra. At this Orchestra; where previously performances were given of Beethoven and Mozart, attendance, organization and management was exclusive to and solely performed by the expatriate community in China, since as far back as the 1850s. A Russian orchestra was in operation in nearby Harbin from the early 20th century. During his employment as a conductor at the Chongqing Symphonic Orchestra, Yin has been credited as a major contributor to the creation of a \\"Guangdong\\" style of playing the violin in Chinese opera, a method still used today. Some of the works he is known for are \\"Magnolia Pearl\\", \\"Huazhou Hero\\", and \\"Overturned the Child\\". From the 1930s to 1960s, he was a composer for Hong Kong cinema. He was also an actor for the films \\"Wealth Is Like a Dream \\"(1948), \\"Bitter Sweet\\" (1936), and \\"A Blooming Rose\\" (1935). The revolutionary spirit of Yin's style has been continued by the first generation of composers immediately following the accession of the Chinese Communist Party to power, namely Li Delun and Cao Peng. During this time he was regarded as one of the most popular performers of this age. In 1952, he stopped working in cinema in Hong Kong, and in 1957 he emigrated to San Francisco and taught music there for eight years. Later, he was invited to Boston to teach in the Chinese Music Society. When he arrived in San Francisco in 1963, he received the key to San Francisco from the mayor at the time (George Christopher). He died on May 10, 1985 in Boston and is currently buried in Forest Hills Cemetery.

He ruled part of modern-day Xinjiang and Central Asia during the 13th century, and actively opposed his cousin, Kublai Khan, who established the Yuan dynasty in China, until Kaidu's death in 1301. Medieval chroniclers often mistranslated Kadan as Kaidu, mistakenly placing Kaidu at the Battle of Legnica. Kadan was the brother of G√ºy√ºk, and Kaidu's uncle.Chambers, James.

His mother's name was Shabkana Khatun from the Bekrin (Mekrin) tribe of mountaineers that were \\"neither Mongols, nor Uighurs\\". In 1260, Marco Polo described Yarkand, part of the area under Kaidu as \\"five days' journey in extent\\"; that its inhabitants were mostly Muslim although there were also some Nestorian and Jacobite Assyrians; and that it had plenty of food and other necessities, \\"especially cotton.\\"Marco Polo and Rustichello of Pisa. The Travels of Marco Polo, Volume 1, Book 1, Chapter 35. Edited and annotated by Henry Yule and revised by Henri Cordier, 3rd Ed. 1903. In the Toluid Civil War between 1260 and 1264, Kublai Khan was warring with his own brother Ariq B√∂ke, who was proclaimed Great Khan at Karakorum, Kaidu began to have major conflicts with Kublai and his ally, the Ilkhanate. Meanwhile, the Chagatayid Khan Alghu, who supported Kublai as Khagan, ravaged the lands of Kaidu. This forced Kaidu to make an alliance with Berke, the khan of the Golden Horde. Conquest of Transoxiana After the defeat of Ariq B√∂ke in 1264, Kublai summoned Kaidu to his court, possibly to discuss the future of the empire and give Kaidu his share of the √ñgedeid appanage in China. But Kaidu avoided appearing at his court and said that his horses were too thin to bear long distance travel. Because Genghis Khan had made a law that all branches of the family had to approve the granting of the title of Great Khan, Kaidu's enmity was a constant obstacle to Kublai's ambitions. In 1266 Baraq was dispatched to Central Asia to take the throne of Chagatai. Kublai instigated Baraq to attack him in 1268. At first Baraq defeated Kaidu, however, the former was defeated by the latter with the assistance of M√∂ngke-Tem√ºr, successor of Berke. When Baraq advanced towards Kaidu, the latter set a trap for the invader's troops on the bank of the Jaxartes, and defeated his forces. Transoxiana was then ravaged by Kaidu. Baraq fled to Samarkand, then Bukhara, plundering the cities along the way in an attempt to rebuild his army. These actions alarmed Kaidu, who did not want the region to be further devastated. Kaidu also needed to free up his army for a potential conflict with Kublai. Peace was therefore proposed, and Baraq was pressured by the governors of the sedentary areas of the khanate, Mas'ud Beg and Daifu, to accept. He did, and peace was declared, although sources conflict on the time and location. Rashid al-Din claims that the meeting took place in the spring of 1269 in Talas, while Wassaf writes that it took place around 1267 to the south of Samarkand. Either way, two-thirds of Transoxiana were granted to Baraq, while the other third went to Kaidu and Mengu-Timur. Kaidu also gained control of the region around Bukhara. Neither side gained control of the cities; the administration of these instead devolved to Mas'ud Beg, while Baraq and Kaidu agreed to reside only in the deserts and mountains. Later defeats and death Kaidu convinced Baraq to attack Persia under the Ilkhanids. Baraq suffered a large defeat at Herat on July 22, 1270 against Abagha. Baraq died en route to meet Kaidu who had been waiting for his weakness. The Chagatayid princes including Mubarak Shah submitted to Kaidu and proclaimed him as their overlord. Sons of Baraq rebelled against Kaidu but they were defeated. Many of the Chagatayid princes fled to the Ilkhanate. Kaidu's early attempt to rule the Chagatayids faced a serious resistance. The Mongol princes such as Neg√ºbei, whom he appointed khan of the House of Chagatai revolted several times. Stable control came when Duwa was made khan who became his number two in 1282. In 1275 Kaidu invaded √úr√ºmqi and demanded its submission, but the Buddhist Idiqut resisted. Kublai sent a relief force to expel him. Kublai's son Nomukhan and generals occupied Almaliq from 1266‚Äì76, to prevent Kaidu's invasion. In 1277, a group of Genghisid princes under M√∂ngke's son Shiregi rebelled, kidnapping Kublai's two sons and his general Antong. The rebels handed Antong to Kaidu and the princes to M√∂ngke- Tem√ºr. The Great Khan's armies drove Shiregi's forces west of the Altai Mountains and strengthened the Yuan garrisons in Mongolia and Xinjiang. However, Kaidu took control over Almaliq. Though Kaidu had fourteen sons, he relied mostly on his daughter Khutulun for advice and aid in military matters. Kaidu had waged almost continuous warfare for more than 30 years against Kublai and his successor Tem√ºr, though he eventually fell in 1301, when he was defeated and wounded during a battle near Karakorum and died shortly afterwards. Legacy Yanqi Kaidu waged a continuous war lasting 30 years against Kublai and his successor. See Kaidu‚ÄìKublai war. Cultural references Kaidu is often portrayed in historical fiction or dramatic works. He was an antagonist in The Journeyer, a novel by Gary Jennings published in 1984. The character of Kaidu was portrayed by Rick Yune in the Netflix original series, Marco Polo (2015‚Äì2016). Kaido is an antagonist in the series One Piece, \\"Kaido of the hundred beasts\\" which is said to be the strongest 'creature' in the One Piece world, Kaido resembles the Mongol warrior Kaidu, and he has a daughter named \\"Yamato\\" that is loosely inspired by the famous Khutulun.

Founding to Irish financial crisis The Sunday Business Post was co-founded by four people: the economist and editor Damien Kiberd, Aileen O'Toole (former editor of Business & Finance), Frank Fitzgibbon (editor of The Sunday Times Ireland) and James Morrissey (spokesperson for Denis O'Brien). The SBP was previously owned by Thomas Crosbie Holdings (TCH). It was then owned by Key Capital, Paul Cooke and staff members (6% equity for staff). It was then owned by Sunrise Media, the shareholders of which include Key Capital. It is now owned by Kilcullen Capital Partners. The paper's first edition appeared on 26 November 1989. While TCH's other major newspaper titles, the Irish Examiner and Evening Echo, are based in Cork, the Post is published in Dublin. The paper describes itself as \\"Ireland's Political, Economic and Financial Newspaper\\". It is a general newspaper with a strong emphasis on commerce, politics and financial markets. The newspaper does not have a sports section. Three supplements are published weekly with the newspaper: The Market, which concentrates on Irish Stock Exchange and company news; The Magazine, an entertainment and features magazine; and a property supplement. A once-monthly Computers in Business magazine is also included. Ted Harding succeeded Kiberd as editor of the paper in 2001 and edited the paper for three years, resigning in October 2004.Harding resigns at SBP Samantha McCaughren, Irish Independent, Business, 28 October 2004. Examinership (2013) An interim examiner was formally appointed to Post Publications Ltd, publisher of The Sunday Business Post newspaper, on 15 March 2013. The High Court was told that there might be a voluntary redundancy scheme at the newspaper in late 2013 which would target 25 staff positions. This could coincide with pay cuts of 7% for employees and further possible changes as part of a financial restructuring plan for the company, the court was told. It was reported on 28 April 2013 that two companies were interested in acquiring the SBP from the examiner. Landmark Media Investments, which acquired some of the assets of Thomas Crosbie Holdings, was no longer interested in the title. It was also reported that the SBP required an investment of at least ‚Ç¨2m to acquire the paper and restructure it. Any new bidder would have to fund the cost of laying off some staff. On 8 May 2013, it was reported that The Sunday Business Post had started staff redundancies. Up to ten staff were to leave the company by 10 May 2013. Staff were also told about a third pay cut.

On 15 May 2013, Post Publications was back in court. It reported that the examiner had failed to find a buyer in the first 70 days of the examinership. The examiner was given a final 30-day extension to find a buyer. If a buyer did not materialise, the examiner had to advise the court immediately. Annual revenue fell from ‚Ç¨15.3 million to ‚Ç¨7.3 million in the five years to 2013. Circulation revenue fell from ‚Ç¨4.9 million to ‚Ç¨3.6 million in the last 5 years to 2013. The newspaper had 76 full-time employees and 123 freelance contributors and made a loss of ‚Ç¨1.2 million in the year to 2013. Paul Cooke and Key Capital Ownership (2013‚Äì2016) On 8 June 2013, it emerged that Key Capital, Paul Cooke and staff (6% equity for staff) had acquired The Sunday Business Post. Examinership ended on 19 June 2013. The new owners of the SBP, Brindisi Ltd, took out a ‚Ç¨350,000 loan to part-fund the purchase. Several staff left the paper, including former chief executive Fiachra O'Riordan, former senior assistant editor Kieron Wood and former deputy chief sub-editor Garvan Grant.

The special aired on NBC as part of The Magical World of Disney on May 6, 1990, and turned out to be the last Muppets special that Henson would work on (he would die 10 days following its airing, on May 16). Prelude At the start of The Magical World of Disney, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner talks about this special while in the presence of Fozzie Bear and his mother Emily. Plot In the television special, the Muppets are visiting Kermit's family for their annual reunion where they meet up with Kermit's aunts and uncles. When the others learn that the swamp is right next to Walt Disney World, they sneak in, and are pursued by a security guard named Quentin Fitzwaller (played by Charles Grodin). Attractions and areas featured include Big Thunder Mountain, the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, Star Tours, the Mad Tea Party, World Showcase, the Walt Disney World Monorail System and the utilidors. The special depicts the three parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Disney-MGM Studios) as one connected area, despite the parks actually being apart from each other. The story ends with the Muppets having a friendly meeting at Mickey Mouse's office where Mickey and Kermit compare their company's theme songs, \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" and \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" and the ideals behind them. After that, the Muppets return to the swamp, but find out about Miss Piggy remaining stuck in front of The Great Movie Ride with her feet in the cement. They return to Walt Disney World for her afterwards to free her. While stuck in the cement, Miss Piggy shouts for help as the credits roll.

It was designed by Conde McCullough and opened in 1931. The bridge has a total length of and contains one reinforced concrete tied arch, identical in design to Ten Mile Creek Bridge and Wilson River Bridge. The locations for all three bridges were similar in that the sandy foundations were not secure enough for the abutment piers required to relieve the lateral pressure of traditional arches. The flood levels of the rivers approached the road grade and ruled out the use of reinforced concrete girders. The corrosive salt air eliminated the practicality of steel truss bridges. The design of the bridge was similar to the rainbow arch design patented by James Barney Marsh. The bridge, along with the Ten Mile Creek Bridge and the Wilson River Bridge, was rehabilitated in 1996 to increase the overhead clearance and add a cathodic protection system to protect the embedded steel reinforcements against the corrosive air. A project to replace the cathodic protection system began in February 2014.

During the Algerian War of 1954-62 several hundred FLN activists and fighters were imprisoned there and 58 were executed by guillotine in the main courtyard. Following Algerian independence the prison was renamed as the Serkadji Prison and converted to a historical museum. However under President Houari Boumedi√®ne the building resumed its role as a prison for political prisoners plus convicted criminals. Insurrection A prison mutiny took place between 21 and 23 February 1995 at Serkadji Prison. The catalyst to the mutiny was the escape of 4 prisoners aided by a guard. During the escape attempt four guards and one prisoner were killed. On the morning of 21 February, a small group attempted to escape, having been given 4 guns and 3 grenades by a recently appointed prison guard, Hamid Mebarki. After killing 4 prison guards, they began opening cell doors, and the prisoners quickly started a mutiny. They sought to negotiate with the authorities for guarantees of the safety of those prisoners who had not been party to the killing of the guards; the authorities considered negotiation inappropriate, and ordered them back to their cells. At mid-afternoon, the security forces stormed the prison; shooting and grenades continued until about 11 am the next day. Some human rights groups cited claims that the government had executed prisoners after resistance stopped without due process and shot the wounded. After the failed breakout security forces killed ninety-six prisoners (according to official figures; other sources claimed up to 110) while trying to suppress the resulting mutiny. An inquiry into the incident was conducted in March by an official human rights organization, the Observatoire National des Droits de l'Homme, which supported the Minister of Justice's account. Eight people were later sentenced to death for their parts in the escape attempt. Moroccans detained Three Moroccans belonging to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb were arrested in early June 2008, and transferred to Serkadji prison to await trial. Considered foreign elements in security jargon, it was unclear if they would be tried in Morocco or Algeria. Algerian security forces arrested the Salafists after they were successful in penetrating the western borders of Algeria. The three attested to carrying arms against the United States and advocating the overthrow of the pro U.S. monarchy in Morocco.Three Moroccans belonging to Al-Qaeda referred to Serkadji prison, El Khabar, 18 June 2008, internet article.

The practice of single-sex schooling was common before the 20th century, particularly in secondary and higher education. Single-sex education in many cultures is advocated on the basis of tradition as well as religion, and is practiced in many parts of the world. Recently, there has been a surge of interest and establishment of single-sex schools due to educational research. Riordan, C. (2009). The Effects of Single Sex Schools: Alced. Argentina Single-sex education is practiced in many Muslim majority countries; while in other parts of the world it is most popular in Chile, Israel, South Korea, and English-speaking countries such as Singapore, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.C. Riordan (2011). The Value of Single Sex Education: Twenty Five Years of High Quality Research, Third International Congress of the European Association for Single Sex Education, Warsaw, Poland. In the Western world, single sex education is primarily associated with the private sector, with the public (state) sector being overwhelmingly mixed sex; while in the Muslim world the situation is the opposite: public schools are usually single sex, while many private schools are mixed sex. Motivations for single sex education range from religious ideas of sex segregation to beliefs that the sexes learn and behave differently, and, as such, they thrive in a single sex environment. In the 19th century, in Western countries, single sex girls' finishing schools, and women's colleges offered women a chance of education at a time when they were denied access to mainstream educational institutions. The former were especially common in Switzerland, the latter in the US and the UK, which were pioneers in women's education. History The New England Female Medical College Girls' school in Trebizond (modern Trabzon), early 20th century Girl students from Brisbane Girls Grammar School, 1914 In 19th century Western Europe, the most common way for girls to access education was at home, through private tutoring, and not at school, due to the strong resistance to women's involvement in schools. By contrast, in the US, early feminists were successful in establishing women's educational institutions. These were different from and considered inferior to men's institutions, but they created some of the first opportunities to formalized higher education for women in the Western world. The Seven Sisters colleges offered unprecedented emancipation for women. The pioneer Salem College of Winston-Salem, North Carolina was founded in 1772, originally as a primary school, later becoming an academy (high school) and finally a college. The New England Female Medical College (1848) and the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (1850) were the first medical institutions in the world established to train women in medicine and offer them the M.D. degree. During the 19th century, ideas about education started to change: modern ideas that defined education as a right, rather than as a privilege available only to a small elite, started to gain support in North America and Europe. As such, mass elementary education was introduced, and more and more coeducational schools were set up. Together with mass education, the coeducation became standard in many places. Increased secularization in the 20th century also contributed to the acceptance of mixed sex education. In 1917 coeducation was mandated in the Soviet Union. According to Cornelius Riordan, \\"By the end of the nineteenth century, coeducation was all but universal in American elementary and secondary public schools (see Kolesnick, 1969; Bureau of Education, 1883; Butler, 1910; Riordan, 1990). And by the end of the 20th century, this was largely true across the world. In the UK, Australia, and Ireland the tradition of single sex education remained quite strong until the 1960s. The 1960s and 1970s were a period of intense social changes, and during that era many anti-discrimination laws were passed, such as the 1972 Title IX. Wiseman (2008) shows that by 2003, only a few countries across the globe have greater than one or two percent single sex schools. But there are exceptions where the percent of single sex schools exceeds 10 percent: Belgium, Chile, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, and most Muslim nations. Recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in single sex schools in modern societies across the globe, both in the public and private sector (Riordan, 2002).\\" Effects The topic of single-sex education is controversial. Advocates argue that it aids student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and solutions to behavioral difficulties. Opponents, however, argue that evidence for such effects is inflated or non-existent, and instead argue that such segregation can increase sexism and impairs the development of interpersonal skills. Advocates of single-sex education believe that there are persistent gender differences in how boys and girls learn and behave in educational settings, and that such differences merit educating them separately. One version of this argument holds that male-female brain differences favor the implementation of gender-specific teaching methods, but such claims have not held up to rigorous scrutiny. In addition, supporters of single-sex education argue that by segregating the genders, students do not become distracted by the other gender's actions in the classrooms. US 2005 systematic review and 2008 study  A systematic review published in 2005 covering 2221 studies was commissioned by the US Department of Education entitled Single-sex versus coeducational schooling: A systematic review. The review, which had statistical controls for socio-economic status of the students and resources of the schools, etc., found that in the study on the effects of single-sex schooling :\\"the results are equivocal. There is some support for the premise that single-sex schooling can be helpful, especially for certain outcomes related to academic achievement and more positive academic aspirations. For many outcomes, there is no evidence of either benefit or harm. There is limited support for the view that single-sex schooling may be harmful or that coeducational schooling is more beneficial for the student.\\" :\\"In terms of outcomes that may be of most interest to the primary stakeholders (students and their parents), such as academic achievement, self-concept, and long-term indicators of success, there is a degree of support for SS schooling.\\" It also said that in general, most studies reported positive effects for single-sex schools on all-subject achievement tests and the preponderance of studies in areas such as academic accomplishment (both concurrent and long term) and adaptation or socioemotional development (both concurrent and long term) yields results lending support to single-sex schooling. The quantitative data itself \\"finds positive results are three to four times more likely to be found for single sex schools than for coeducational schools in the same study for both academic achievement and socio-emotional development,\\" said Cornelius Riordan, one of the directors of the research.Riordan, C. (2007). The Effects of Single Sex Schools: What Do We Know? Building Gender-Sensitive Schools: First International Congress on Single Sex Education. Barcelona In 2008, the US government sponsored another study, Early Implementation of Public Single- Sex Schools: Perceptions and Characteristics, which listed the benefits of single-sex schools: (1) Decreases distractions in learning, (2) Reduces student behavior problems, (3) Provides more leadership opportunities, (4) Promotes a sense of community among students and staff, (5) Improves student self-esteem, (6) Addresses unique learning styles and interests of boys or girls, (7) Decreases sex bias in teacher-student interactions, (8) Improves student achievement, (9) Decreases the academic problems of low achieving students, (10) Reduces sexual harassment among students, (11) Provides more positive student role models, (12) Allows for more opportunities to provide social and moral guidance, (13) Provides choice in public education. Later studies Australian researchers reported in 2009 that high school students' interpersonal relationships were positively associated with both academic and nonacademic achievement, although the interaction between boys and girls in a majority of cases resulted in less homework done, less enjoyment of school, and lower reading and math scores.Martin, A. J., Marsh, H. W., McInerney, D. M., Green, J.

March 23, 2009, 1-6. An all-girls school swimming team from Sydney A UCLA report commissioned by the National Coalition of Girls' Schools used data from a large national survey of U.S. college freshmen and found stronger academic orientations among women who had attended all-girls, compared to coeducational high schools, but the effects were small and the authors concluded \\"that the marginal benefits do not justify the potential threats to gender equity brought on by academic sex segregation\\". In September 2011, the journal Science published a study deeply critical of gender-segregated schooling, arguing that the movement towards single-sex education \\"is deeply misguided, and often justified by weak, cherry-picked, or misconstrued scientific claims rather than by valid scientific evidence\\". The study goes on to conclude that \\"there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex (SS) education improves students' academic performance, but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism.\\" Opponents of single-sex education, including the authors of the Science article, argue that it is not single-sex education that is producing positive results but rather, the ability of students who enter such programs and resources of the schools that are responsible. They also argue that single-sex schooling does not adequately prepare students for adult workplaces and society, where males and females need to respect and communicate effectively with each other. Coeducational schools offer greater opportunity to break down sexist attitudes through purposeful interaction with the other sex. Coeducational schools are also said to create greater feelings of safety and mutual respect among students across the gender spectrum. Leonard Sax, the President of National Association for Single-sex Public Education or NASSPE countered the Science article by saying that \\"ALL the studies cited in the SCIENCE article regarding 'negative impacts' were in fact studies involving a small number of PRE-SCHOOL students attending a COED pre-kindergarten\\" (capitalized letters in the original). He further said that \\"these authors provide no evidence for their substantive claim that 'gender divisions are made even more salient in SS settings.' In fact, this conjecture has been tested, and proven false, in multiple studies.\\" Sax cited a study which said that \\"girls in the all-girls classroom were less aware of 'being a girl' and less aware of gender stereotypes regarding science, compared to girls who were randomly assigned to the coed classroom.\\" In January 2012, an unpublished study of the University of Pennsylvania, involving a randomized experiment, considered the experiment with the highest level of scientific evidence. The data comes from schools in South Korea, where a law was passed randomly assigning students to schools in their district. The study by Park, Berhman and Choi titled Causal Effects of Single-Sex Schools on College Entrance Exams and College Attendance: Random Assignment in Seoul High Schools concluded that \\"Attending all-boys schools or all-girls schools rather than attending coeducational schools is significantly associated with higher average scores.\\" In 2014, E. Pahlke, J. S. Hyde, and C. M. Allison published a meta-analysis comparing achievement and attitudes in single-sex versus coeducational schools that included 1.6 million students in grades K-12. The study concluded that \\"there is little evidence of an advantage of SS schooling for girls or boys for any of the outcomes.\\" In a 2015 review of this study Cornelius Riordan observed that the authors \\"employ a 0.2 effect-size threshold in drawing these conclusions about there being no advantage to single-sex schooling. Despite the above conclusion, the research found that, in a separate analysis of just the best studies (well controlled) conducted in America, the effect size in mathematics was 0.14 for both boys and girls. The verbal performance was 0.22 for girls and 0.13 for boys.... Educational research has shown that a standard effect size of 0.10 on gains from sophomore to senior year of high school is equivalent to one full year of learning by the average public school student in the United States.\\" Thus, he says, that \\"Applying this standard, a difference of 0.10 (or greater) between students in single-sex and in coeducational schools would be substantially important.\\"Riordan, Cornelius, Schools, Single-Sex. Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. 2015. By region=Australia James Cook Boys High Located in Sydney, NSW, Australia. In Australia, most single sex schools are fee paying independent or Catholic schools. There are a small number of single sex government schools, while within the independent sector the proportion of pupils attending single sex schools has dropped from 31% in 1985 to 24% in 1995. Nevertheless, single sex education in Australia is much more popular than in the US. In 2001, the Australian Council for Educational Research after six years of study of more 270,000 students, in 53 academic subjects, showed that boys and girls from single-sex classrooms \\"scored on average 15 to 22 percentile ranks higher than did boys and girls in coeducational settings. The report also documented that boys and girls in single-sex schools were more likely to be better behaved and to find learning more enjoyable and the curriculum more relevant.\\" Bangladesh In Bangladesh, a large number of city schools and colleges are single-sex institutions except for universities. Notable all Cantonment schools (non-residential schools run directly by Military), Zilla Schools (run directly by Government [First starting in early colonial ages]), Cadet colleges (residential schools run directly by Military) are single-sex schools. Canada Many single-sex schools exist in Canada, particularly Roman Catholic separate schools. Examples in the City of Toronto include: Notre Dame High School, Neil McNeil High School, Chaminade College School, St. Joseph's Morrow Park Catholic Secondary School, Madonna Catholic Secondary School, Brebeuf College School, St. Joseph's College School, Michael Power High School, St. Joseph's High School, Islington, St. Michael's College School and De La Salle College School, Oaklands, Royal St. George's College. India The number of single-sex state schools has dropped substantially over the past 40 years, from 2,500 to 400. Figures indicate that, as of 2002, 53% of girls in the Indian population actually attend schools. Some conservative parents may decide to withdraw their daughters at the age of puberty onset because of fear of distraction. It is also believed that by having single-sex classrooms the students will be able to focus more on their education, as they will not have the distraction of the other sex. The study argues that co-education schools provide opportunities for students to interact with their peers which de-stresses students and creates a friendlier, more relaxed environment. Ireland Male students, De La Salle College, County Waterford, 1923 A country with conservative traditions, Ireland has significantly more pupils studying in single-sex schools than other western countries: more than one third of second level schools are single sex. Even at primary level, single sex education is quite common: 17% of primary school children attend single-sex schools. Middle East School girls in Iraq In the Middle East, public schools in several countries are all gender- segregated, whereas private schools are co-educational. There are single-sex private schools as well. In Iran, single-sex public schools have been in place since the Islamic Revolution. Universities are mostly co-educational in Iran. In the United Arab Emirates, private schools are mostly co-educational, while public schools are segregated. In Syria, private schools are co-educational, while public schools are mostly, but not exclusively, segregated. Universities are all co-educational. In Israel, secular public schools are co-educational. Many, but not all, public Orthodox schools are single-sex; the private ultra- Orthodox schools are almost always gender-segregated, usually starting in elementary school. In Lebanon, most schools are co-educational schools. New Zealand In New Zealand, almost all primary schools are coeducational (1,935 co-ed, 7 boys-only, 4 girls-only), while there are many more examples of single-sex secondary schools. There are 45 boys-only secondary schools, 53 girls-only secondary schools and 274 mixed secondary schools . During the mid-20th century, several state coeducational secondary schools split into two single-sex schools, with one school moving to a new site, to alleviate overcrowding. These included Hamilton (1955), Gisborne (1956), Hastings (1956), Tauranga (1958), Rotorua (1959), Westlake (1962), Kelston (1963), and Marlborough (1963). Nigeria In Nigeria, public opinion regarding sexes in schools is influenced most by religious and cultural beliefs rather than the idea that students learn better separated into sexes. Because of this, the attitude towards the separation/integration of sexes varies depending on the ethnic makeup of the region. People in northern Nigeria are mostly Muslim and as a result, are more inclined to choose single-sex education over co- education in-line with their religious beliefs. However country-wide, co- education schools are more common than single-sex schools. In contrast to the predominance of co-education schools, many prestigious educational institutions only accept one sex, major examples are, King's College and Queen's College situated in Lagos. At university level, although the sexes are not separated in the classroom, it is common practice to employ a single sex housing policy on university campuses e.g. Covenant University. Pakistan Most of the private schools in Karachi, Lahore, Hyderabad, Islamabad and Rawalpindi are co-education but government schools are all single-sex education. Most colleges are also single-sex education institutions till graduation. There is one women's university in Rawalpindi as well. A few other universities also offer degree courses separately to both genders. In some cities, single-sex education is preferred, like Peshawar and Quetta, where many schools are single-sex educational, but there are also schools which are co-educational. However, most of the higher education in Pakistan is co- education. Sweden Boys in a single sex school in 1922 in Norrk√∂ping Around 1800, girls' middle-secondary schools begun to appear, and become more common during the 19th century. By the mid 1970s, most of them had been scrapped and replaced with coeducation. By a law from 1575, girls as well as boys were expected to be given elementary schooling. The establishment for girls' schools was left to each city's own authorities, and no school for girls were founded until the Rudbeckii flickskola in 1632, and that school was to be an isolated example. However, some schools for boys did occasionally accept female students, even at high levels: Ursula Agricola and Maria Jonae Palmgren were accepted at Visings√∂ Gymnasium in 1644 and 1645 respectively, and Aurora Liljenroth graduated from the same school in 1788. During the 18th century, many girls' schools were established, referred to as Mamsellskola (Mamsell School) or Franskpension (French Pension).Gunhild Kyle (1972). Svensk flickskola under 1800-talet. G√∂teborg: Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv. ISBN These schools could normally be classified as finishing schools, with only a shallow education of polite conversation in French, embroidery, piano playing and other accomplishments, and the purpose was only to give the students a suitable minimum education to be a lady, a wife and a mother. In the first half of the 19th century, a growing discontent over the shallow education of women eventually resulted in the finishing schools being gradually replaced by girls' schools with a higher level of academic secondary education, called \\"Higher Girl Schools\\", in the mid-19th century. At the time of the introduction of the compulsory elementary school for both sexes in Sweden in 1842, only five schools in Sweden provided academic secondary education to females: the Societetsskolan (1786), Fruntimmersf√∂reningens flickskola (1815) and Kjellbergska flickskolan (1833) in Gothenburg, Askersunds flickskola (1812) in Askersund, and Wallinska skolan (1831) in Stockholm. During the second half of the 19th century, there were secondary education girl schools in most Swedish cities. All of these were private, with the exception of the Women's college H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet in Stockholm from 1861, and its adjacent girls' school Statens normalskola f√∂r flickor. The Girls' School Committee of 1866 organized the regulation of girls' schools and female education in Sweden: from 1870, some girls' schools were given the right to offer the Gymnasium (school) level to their students, and from 1874, those girls' schools which met the demands were given governmental support and some were given the right to administer the school leaving exam. This was necessary to make it possible for women to enroll at the universities, which had been opened to women in 1870, as female students were not accepted in the same schools as male students. United Kingdom Eton College, a prestigious English independent school for boys While England has a very strong tradition of single-sex education, Scottish education was largely mixed, and Wales introduced dual schools (a girls' side and a boys' side under one roof) in 1889. In England, most secondary education was single-sex until the 1970s. Single-sex schooling was traditionally the norm for secondary schools in most parts of the United Kingdom, especially for private, grammar and secondary modern schools, but most UK schools are now coeducational. In the state sector of the U.K. education system very few single sex schools remain. The number of single-sex state schools has fallen from nearly 2,500 to just over 400 in 40 years. According to Alan Smithers, Professor of Education at Buckingham University, there was no evidence that single-sex schools were consistently superior. A major longitudinal study of over 17,000 individuals examined whether single-sex schooling made a difference for a wide range of outcomes, including academic attainment, earnings, marriage, childbearing and divorce. The authors found that girls fared better in examinations at age 16 at single- sex schools, while boys achieved similar results at single-sex or co- educational schools. Girls rated their abilities in maths and sciences higher if they went to a girls' school, and boys rated their abilities in English higher if they went to a boys' school, i.e. gender stereotyping was weaker in the single-sex sector.Sullivan, A. 2009. 'Academic self-concept, gender and single-sex schooling' British Educational Research Journal 35(2) 259-288 Later in life, women who had been to single-sex schools went on to earn higher wages than women who had been to co-educational schools. United States Students at Western College for Women, 1914 Philadelphia High School for Girls in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Until the 19th century, single-sex education was the norm in the US, although this varied by region. In New England there was more mixed-sex education than in the South, and girls in New England had more access to education in general. With the generalization of elementary education in the 19th century, mixed-sex education started to spread rapidly. According to Cornelius Riordan, \\"By the end of the nineteenth century, coeducation was all but universal in American elementary and secondary public schools (see Kolesnick, 1969; Bureau of Education, 1883; Butler, 1910; Riordan, 1990). However, higher education was usually single-sex, and men's colleges and women's colleges were common well into the 20th century. A form of education strongly associated with sex-segregation is that of Catholic schools, although many Catholic schools today are coeducational. The idea of educating students differently by sex, formally or informally, was common until the 1970s.http://www.feminist.org/education/pdfs/9%20Single%20Sex.pdf A controversy regarding single-sex education in the United States is its association with racist ideologies in the 1950s in the American South. After the Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ruled racial segregation in education unconstitutional, therefore paving the way to educating together black and white children, many conservatives reacted very negatively to the idea of black boys and white girls socializing together, potentially leading to interracial romantic couples. As such, segregation by sex in schools became quite common during that era across the Southern US, with many single sex educational institutions being established. A major event that affected single-sex schooling in the US was when the Title IX amendments of the Education Amendments of 1972 were passed. The Encyclopedia of Women and Gender explains Title IX as being, \\"Founded on the premises of equal opportunity, equal access, and full integration, it focused on providing complete access to participation in all functions of schooling, regardless of gender\\" (Sex Segregation In Education, 2001). Many feminists fought for the passage of this law. The goal was to ban all sex discrimination in any education program which received financial aid from the government. It was stated specifically on the Department of Education website as, \\"No person in the US, on the basis of sex, can be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\\". The main cause which led to the start of more public schools having single-sex classes or entire schools was when the reforms to the Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 were passed in 2006. Originally Title IX had allowed separation of males and females in certain areas in school prior to the new changes. For example, they were allowed to have single gender classes for physical-education when there were contact sports involved and also for sex-education classes. Kasic (2008) indicates that the new regulations allow nonvocational public schools to still receive funding if they offer single-sex classes or entire single-sex schools, but in order to start these programs they have to have a governmental or educational objective. These programs are also required to be voluntary, so public schools cannot be required to offer these single-sex programs and if they do they cannot force students to participate in them. Diana Schemo explains in a New York Times article, \\"Until now, publics school districts that offered a school to one sex generally had to provide a comparable school for students of the other sex. The new rules, however say districts can simply offer such students the option to attend comparable coeducational schools\\" (Schemo, 2006, p. 2). Since these regulations were approved the number of public schools offering single-sex programs has been on a steady incline due to the fact that the rules are more flexible. In the United States, the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of single-sex public education in the 1996 case of United States v. Virginia. This ruling, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concluded that single-sex education in the public sector is constitutional only if comparable courses, services, and facilities are made available to both sexes. The No Child Left Behind Act contains provisions (sections 5131.a.23. and 5131c, 20 U.S.C. section 7215(a)(23), and section 7215(c)) designed by their authors‚Äîsenators Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX)‚Äîto facilitate single-sex education in public schools. These provisions led to the publication of new federal rules in October 2006 to allow districts to create single-sex schools and classes provided that 1) enrollment is voluntary, and 2) comparable courses, services, and facilities are available to both sexes. The number of public schools offering single-sex classrooms rose from 4 in 1998 to 540 in 2010, according to the web site of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education. Education Next and the Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University sponsored a nationwide survey conducted by Knowledge Networks in early 2008. According to the survey, \\"more than one-third of Americans feel parents should have the option of sending their child to a single-sex school\\". = Gender segregation in American history = Smith College, class of 1902 In the United States, gender segregation in schools was initially a product of an era when traditional gender roles categorically determined scholastic, professional, and social opportunities based on sex. For instance, leading experts supported gender segregation in higher education because they considered it \\"to be dangerous and inappropriate for women. Experts claimed that scientific evidence established that women were physically and temperamentally not suited to the rigors of the academy . ... Separate education for men and women paralleled the separate spheres that each was expected to occupy.\\"Valorjie K. Vojdik, Girls' Schools After VMI: Do They Make the Grade?, 4 Duke J. Gender L. & Pol'y 69, 84 (1997). Furthermore, colleges and universities did not consider female applicants until the second half of the nineteenth century when the women's rights movement began advocating for gender equality.See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 514 (1999) (discussing historical lack of collegiate opportunities for women). In response to social progression \\"at the turn of the twentieth century, educators, particularly those in the South, fiercely resisted coeducation in elite all-male colleges, and most of the Ivy League institutions would drag their feet well into the twentieth century before becoming coeducational.\\"Id. at 515 (noting societal reluctance towards implementation of coeducation). See also Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, The Myths and Justifications of Sex Segregation in Higher Education: VMI and the Citadel, 4 Duke J. Gender L. & Pol'y 101, 118 n. 150 (\\"Columbia . . . remained all-male until 1983. Yale and Princeton became coeducational in 1969, followed in 1972 by Brown and Dartmouth, and Harvard in 1976.\\") = Importance of history and culture in single-sex education determinations = Girls and boys segregation in schools is definitive of a sex-based classification, and, thus, it must be supported by an \\"exceedingly persuasive justification\\" to pass constitutional muster.J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994) (exercising stricter standard of review for sex-based classifications). In light of this requisite standard, the legality of single-sex educational institutions depends on the accuracy of underlying assumptions and support.See Katharine T. Bartlett et al., Gender and Law 2 (6th ed. 2013) (discussing legitimacy of sex-based classifications). Accordingly, it is important to be aware that a majority of research used to advocate the benefits of single-sex education is cloaked in uncertainty.Id. at 503 (\\"The touted 'general consensus' about positive education and socialization effects of single-sex education simply does not exist.\\") Specifically, proponents \\"who want to build a case for single-sex education usually draw on ... uncontrolled studies, small samples, and anecdotal evidence; the positive findings are repeated but are not analyzed\\".Id. (noting proponents' refusal to rely on up-to-date studies). Alternatively, opponents of single-sex education are able to gather tangible support from observable patterns of pervasive gender inequality in other social contexts.See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 514 (1999). According to Levit, \\"Supporters of single-sex education talk about the subject as if it were an isolated matter . . . without the recognition of either how pervasive sex segregation is in other contexts or the historical and cultural connotations attached to segregation. Those who favor single-sex education argue that we can vest it with new meaning. This myopic optimism ignores the history, social meaning, and impact of segregation.\\" Id. See also Lucinda M. Finley, Sex-Blind Nation? The Uneasy Legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson for Sex and Gender Discrimination, 12 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 1089, 1103-04 (1996) (explaining that \\"separate never really means equal. All-girls schools usually have fewer academic offerings . . . . Women's sports events frequently offer less prize money.\\") The diversity of opinions that concurrently support gender segregation in education creates a complex and fragmented dynamic. The miscellany of proponents includes: conservatives emphasizing innate gender differences, traditionalists favoring rigid gender roles, democrats striving to remedy past discrimination, progressives promoting diversity in academic choices, and feminists championing exclusively female support systems.See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 452-53 (1999) (detailing rationales of varied proponents). Because the coalition of proponents consists of parties with dissimilar interests, the body of \\"educational research regarding the efficacy of single-sex schools is mixed at best\\".Id. at 454. Moreover, advocates tend to bolster their respective positions by emphasizing specific aspects of educational research without addressing the remaining \\"array of evidence regarding institutions, structures, and processes that construct views on gender and equality\\".Id. Although educational research supporting gender segregation in schools is rife with ambiguity, \\"the social research is absolutely clear that separation on the basis of identity characteristics creates feelings of individual inadequacy and instills beliefs about group hierarchy\\". Studies used to make policy or legal arguments in the current debate over single-sex education narrowly \\"look only at the slice of the social picture that schooling represents\\".See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 511 (1999). An informed assessment regarding the appropriate role of gender segregation in contemporary and future education developments requires contemplation of potential implications beyond the direct, internal, and immediate influences that single-sex schools stand to exert on students.Id. (\\"The contextual backdrop is missing from the single-sex education debate ... The studies themselves, and those persons using the studies to make political and legal arguments, fail to consider the social context of gender education.\\") It is undeniable that gender inequality exists, consciously or not, in contemporary social, professional, and domestic hierarchies or relationships.Id. (discussing importance of potential impact on existing gender inequalities). Specifically, \\"[t]he dimension of sociological evidence regarding sex-exclusivity that is often overlooked in the single-sex schools debate is the very obvious fact of pervasive and persistent sex segregation in all aspects of daily living.\\" Id. Indeed, \\"[g]ender separatism is so pervasive that it is almost invisible. It is woven into the fabric of our daily social routines.\\" Vestiges of past gender segregation and its connotations throughout American history validate questions concerning the likely effects of contemporary institutions of single-sex education on prevailing gender = Impact on female citizens' civil rights = Assessing the current single-sex education debate through a broad lens realizes contextual factors that effectively constitute the crux of the issue.Id. at 454 (recognizing that current discourse fails to consider \\"the wider body of social science data concerning the role of sex segregation itself in the formation of gender role attitudes\\"). Most discussions regarding the potential effects of single-sex education characterize future students of such institutions as the sole beneficiaries of resulting impacts. An appropriate assessment, however, considers contextual implications and realizes that female citizens as a class will be the true beneficiaries if single-sex education developments reach fruition.Id. (\\"The American tradition of sex-exclusivity in public education is a legacy that is tied inextricably to the exclusion of women from public and professional life.\\") If the multitude of diverging interests that influence the single-sex education dispute were distilled, the core concern of the discussion asks whether single-sex education will help remedy past gender discrimination or not. In sum, > [Gender] separatism originated in beliefs about innate differences between > women and men in inclinations and abilities, sentiments that comported with > 'widely held views about women's proper place.' The existence of segregated > higher education was itself, for centuries, a critical factor in the > limitation of women's professional opportunities. The implications of reviving single-sex education in America could further erode outdated sex stereotypes and, thereby, facilitate gender equality in other social contexts.See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 454 (1999). Incorporating the national history of gender segregation allows all sides to balance hypothetical benefits of future students against the potential regression of gender equality in America.Id. \\"In determining whether sex-exclusive education will remedy existing educational disparities for girls or will aggravate a system of sex role stereotyping, courts must consider the historical and social meaning of sex segregation in American education.\\" Id.

Kigurumi of HeartCatch PreCure! characters Kigurumi of Kantai Collection characters Animegao kigurumi, known colloquially as kigurumi, kigu or occasionally doller and kig, is a type of cosplay which uses a masked character costume to portray anime or cartoon characters in the real world. The face of the performer is fully covered with a stylized mask, and the costume of the character is worn. Used in stage shows, the concept of animegao kigurumi was then adopted by cosplayers, who made custom masks of various characters. In Japan, most cosplayers refer to this style as , while performers are sometimes called \\"dollers\\". It is still a very minor part of the cosplay scene in Japan, though around 2005, it began attracting attention elsewhere, including the North America and Europe. As with other kinds of cosplay, many hobbyists have costumes of established characters from games or animations. The characters are usually female, and commonly human, although kigurumi characters of other races and genders do exist, including male (such as Kenshin Himura from Rurouni Kenshin), mechanical (such as Gundam Wing), elfin (such as Deedlit or Pirotess from Lodoss), and demonic (such as Inuyasha from the anime of the same name). Some kigurumi are original characters created by the performer. Both men and women wear kigurumi. By wearing a body suit and mask, kigurumi cosplayers are able to get closer to the appearance of the original character, especially in the case of animal characters or highly stylised characters. In animegao kigurumi, the performer playing a humanoid anime character wears a flesh-coloured body suit (a zentai suit known as a hadatai) and matching mask usually moulded from clay or fiberglass composites. The body suit allows them less-detailed skin features, on the level of animated characters, and the mask allows a similar level of facial features. Some hobbyists obtain masks from established hobbyist mask studios. Though this term originated as animegao, the original Japanese term is not used to describe masks based on anime characters. Instead, the term kigurumi () is used by most performers.  Use of animegao kigurumi  While kigurumi is largely used in stage shows and by hobbyists, it has extended into the acts of other performers.

An imposing person physically, she weighed between 190 and 230 pounds (86 to 104kg) and stood six-feet-two-inches (188cm) tall in her prime. Early life Emerson was born in Hawarden, Iowa, to John Alvin and Josie L. (n√©e Washburn) Emerson, the middle and only surviving child of three (her two siblings died in infancy). She began her career at age three, touring Iowa with her mother, a character actress. Following her graduation from West High School in Des Moines in 1916, she moved to New York City, where she performed in vaudeville. Career Emerson made her Broadway debut in Lysistrata in 1930, when theatrical producer Norman Bel Geddes cast her for the role of Lamputo, an Amazon. She made her film d√©but in Smiling Faces (1932) but then returned to the theater. In 1947, critic Brooks Atkinson praised her performance (\\"vastly entertaining as the garrulous old crone\\") in Street Scene. In the 1940s, Emerson was also known as the voice of \\"Elsie the Cow\\" in radio commercials for Borden Milk. Some of Emerson's more memorable roles were as a circus strongwoman in the film Adam's Rib (1949), lifting actor Spencer Tracy up in the air; as a nefarious masseuse-conspirator in the noirish Cry of the City (1948); and as a mail-order bride in Westward the Women (1952); as a prospector in an episode of Death Valley Days (Big Liz) (1958). Her most famous character, however, was the sadistic prison matron Evelyn Harper in Caged (1950), a role that garnered her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. On television, Emerson guest-starred in \\"Housekeeper\\", the final episode of the series It's a Great Life. In that episode she portrays a bossy housekeeper who temporarily takes charge while Amy Morgan, played by Frances Bavier, is away on vacation. She had a regular role as well, as \\"Mother\\", on the detective series Peter Gunn (1958), for which she received an Emmy nomination; and she appeared on the CBS sitcom The Dennis O'Keefe Show (1959), starring with Dennis O'Keefe and Ricky Kelman. She died during the run of Peter Gunn and was succeeded in the same role by Minerva Urecal, who bore a strong resemblance to Emerson but was far shorter. Death Emerson died of liver disease in 1960 at age 62 in Hollywood on April 24, 1960. She is interred in Grace Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Hawarden, Iowa. She never married or had children.

He also spent two years with Manchester United in the Premier League. Ricardo won two international caps for Spain, and was part of the squad for the 2002 World Cup. Club career=Atl√©tico / Valladolid Born in Madrid, Ricardo began his professional career at Atl√©tico Madrid, working his way through the reserves and going on to represent the senior squad until 1998. Barred by Jos√© Francisco Molina, he only managed one first-team appearance which came during the 1996‚Äì97 season, in a 3‚Äì2 away win against Real Zaragoza on 2 June 1997. Subsequently, Ricardo was transferred to Real Valladolid, also in La Liga. He spent four years at the club, becoming first-choice in the 2001‚Äì02 campaign (all 38 matches played) while also being selected as a member of the Spanish squad for the 2002 World Cup, though he did not play in the finals.

POSIX shells and other Unix shells allow background execution by using the & character at the end of command, and in PowerShell you can use \`Start-Process\` or \`Start-Job\` commands.  Completions  Bash. Completion features assist the user in typing commands at the command line, by looking for and suggesting matching words for incomplete ones. Completion is generally requested by pressing the completion key (often the key). Command name completion is the completion of the name of a command. In most shells, a command can be a program in the command path (usually \`$PATH\`), a builtin command, a function or alias. Path completion is the completion of the path to a file, relative or absolute. Wildcard completion is a generalization of path completion, where an expression matches any number of files, using any supported syntax for file matching. Variable completion is the completion of the name of a variable name (environment variable or shell variable). Bash, zsh, and fish have completion for all variable names. PowerShell has completions for environment variable names, shell variable names and ‚Äî from within user-defined functions ‚Äî parameter names. Command argument completion is the completion of a specific command's arguments. There are two types of arguments, named and positional: Named arguments, often called options, are identified by their name or letter preceding a value, whereas positional arguments consist only of the value. Some shells allow completion of argument names, but few support completing values. Bash, zsh and fish offer parameter name completion through a definition external to the command, distributed in a separate completion definition file. For command parameter name/value completions, these shells assume path/filename completion if no completion is defined for the command. Completion can be set up to suggest completions by calling a shell function. The fish shell additionally supports parsing of man pages to extract parameter information that can be used to improve completions/suggestions. In PowerShell, all types of commands (cmdlets, functions, script files) inherently expose data about the names, types and valid value ranges/lists for each argument. This metadata is used by PowerShell to automatically support argument name and value completion for built-in commands/functions, user- defined commands/functions as well as for script files. Individual cmdlets can also define dynamic completion of argument values where the completion values are computed dynamically on the running system.  Command history  A user of a shell may find that he/she is typing something similar to what the user typed before. If the shell supports command history the user can call the previous command into the line editor and edit it before issuing it again. Shells that support completion may also be able to directly complete the command from the command history given a partial/initial part of the previous command. Most modern shells support command history. Shells which support command history in general also support completion from history rather than just recalling commands from the history. In addition to the plain command text, PowerShell also records execution start- and end time and execution status in the command history.  Mandatory argument prompt  Mandatory arguments/parameters are arguments/parameters which must be assigned a value upon invocation of the command, function or script file. A shell that can determine ahead of invocation that there are missing mandatory values, can assist the interactive user by prompting for those values instead of letting the command fail. Having the shell prompt for missing values will allow the author of a script, command or function to mark a parameter as mandatory instead of creating script code to either prompt for the missing values (after determining that it is being run interactively) or fail with a message. PowerShell allows commands, functions and scripts to define arguments/parameters as mandatory. The shell determines prior to invocation if there is any mandatory arguments/parameters which have not been bound, and will then prompt the user for the value(s) before actual invocation.  Automatic suggestions  Command-line completion in PowerShell ISE.With automatic suggestions the shell monitors while the interactive user is typing and displays context-relevant suggestions without interrupting the typing instead of the user explicitly requesting completion. The PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment uses the discoverable metadata to provide \\"intellisense\\" - i.e. suggestions that automatically pops up as the user types, in addition to when the user explicitly requests completion lists by pressing e.g.  Directory history, stack or similar features  A shell may record the locations the user has used as current locations and allow fast switching to any location/directory in the history. One of the uses of the zsh directory stack is to record a directory history. In particular, the option and advanced arguments and completion are used for this purpose. PowerShell allows multiple named stacks to be used. Locations (directories) can be pushed onto/popped from the current stack or a named stack. Any stack can become the current (default) stack. Unlike most other shells, PowerShell's location concept allow location stacks to hold file system locations as well as other location types like e.g. Active Directory organizational units/groups, SQL Server databases/tables/objects, Internet Information Server applications/sites/virtual directories. 4DOS and Take Command Console record history of current directories and allows the user to switch to a directory in the history using a popup a window.  Implicit directory change  A directory name can be used directly as a command which implicitly changes the current location to the directory. This must be distinguished from an unrelated load drive feature supported by Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32, where the drive letter L: will be implicitly updated to point to the load path of a loaded application, thereby allowing applications to refer to files residing in their load directory under a standardized drive letter instead of under an absolute path.  Autocorrection  When a command line does not match a command or arguments directly, spell checking can automatically correct common typing mistakes (such as case sensitivity, missing letters). There are two approaches to this; the shell can either suggest probable corrections upon command invocation, or this can happen earlier as part of a completion or autosuggestion. The tcsh and zsh shells feature optional spell checking/correction, upon command invocation. Fish does the autocorrection upon completion and autosuggestion. The feature is therefore not in the way when typing out the whole command and pressing enter, whereas extensive use of the tab and right-arrow keys makes the shell mostly case insensitive. The PSReadLine PowerShell module (which is shipped with version 5.0) provides the option to specify a CommandValidationHandler ScriptBlock which runs before submitting the command. This allows for custom correcting of commonly mistyped commands, and verification before actually running the command.  Integrated environment  An integrated environment is the integration of the command-line interface with editors (typically multiple documents), help system and possibly debugging and other tools. Take Command Console (TCC) comes with an integrated environment with command line pane, file explorer, editor, batch debugger and more. PowerShell ISE includes a command line pane with support for integrated command line, copy-paste, multiple document editors, source-level debugging, help pane, command explorer pane and scripting interface allowing scripts/modules to manipulate menus, add-ons etc. The ISE (menus, windows, shortcuts, addons) are customizable through scripts.  Snippets  Snippets are small regions of reusable script code. Snippets are often used to save keystrokes, or to assist the user with common scripting patterns. Many text editors support snippets for scripting either as built-in functionality or through plugins. PowerShell supports snippets in the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) using .  Value prompt  A shell script can prompt the interactive user for a value.  Menu/options selector  A shell script can present the interactive user with a list of choices.  Progress indicator  A shell script (or job) can report progress of long running tasks to the interactive user. Unix/Linux systems may offer other tools support using progress indicators from scripts or as standalone-commands, such as the program \\"pv\\". These are not integrated features of the shells, however. PowerShell has a built-in command and API functions (to be used when authoring commands) for writing/updating a progress bar. Progress bar messages are sent separates from regular command output and the progress bar is always displayed at the ultimate interactive users console regardless of whether the progress messages originates from an interactive script, from a background job or from a remote session.  Interactive table  Output from a command execution can be displayed in a table/grid which can be interactively sorted and filtered and/or otherwise manipulated after command execution ends. PowerShell cmdlet displays data in an interactive window with interactive sorting and filtering.  Colored directory listings  JP Software command-line processors provide user-configurable colorization of file and directory names in directory listings based on their file extension and/or attributes through an optionally defined %COLORDIR% environment variable. For the Unix/Linux shells, this is a feature of the command and the terminal.  Text highlighting  The command line processors in DOS Plus, Multiuser DOS, REAL/32 and in all versions of DR-DOS support a number of optional environment variables to define escape sequences allowing to control text highlighting, reversion or colorization for display or print purposes in commands like TYPE. All mentioned command line processors support %$ON% and %$OFF%. If defined, these sequences will be emitted before and after filenames. A typical sequence for %$ON% would be \\\\033[1m in conjunction with ANSI.SYS, \\\\033p for an ASCII terminal or \\\\016 for an IBM or ESC/P printer. Likewise, typical sequences for %$OFF% would be \\\\033[0m, \\\\033q, \\\\024, respectively. The variables %$HEADER% and %$FOOTER% are only supported by COMMAND.COM in DR-DOS 7.02 and higher to define sequences emitted before and after text blocks in order to control text highlighting, pagination or other formatting options. For the Unix/Linux shells, this is a feature of the terminal.  Syntax highlighting  An independent project offers syntax highlighting as an add-on to the Z Shell (zsh). This is not part of the shell, however. PowerShell provides customizable syntax highlighting on the command line through the PSReadLine module. This module can be used with PowerShell v3.0+, and it's included with v5.0. Additionally, it is loaded by default in the command line host \\"powershell.exe\\" in v5.0. The PowerShell ISE also includes syntax highlighting on the command line as well as in the script pane. Take Command Console (TCC) offers syntax highlighting in the integrated environment. Context sensitive help 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT / Take Command Console and PowerShell (in PowerShell ISE) looks up context-sensitive help information when is pressed. Zsh provides various forms of configurable context-sensitive help as part of its widget, command, or in the completion of options for some commands. Command builder A command builder is a guided dialog which assists the user in filling in a command. PowerShell has a command builder which is available in PowerShell ISE or which can be displayed separately through the cmdlet.

By sending keystroke sequences the user may be able to direct the application to perform actions that would be impossible to achieve through input redirection or would otherwise require an interactive user. For example, if an application acts on keystrokes, which cannot be redirected, distinguishes between normal and extended keys, flushes the queue before accepting new input on startup or under certain conditions, or because it does not read through standard input at all. Keystroke stacking typically also provides means to control the timing of simulated keys being sent or to delay new keys until the queue was flushed etc. It also allows to simulate keys which are not present on a keyboard (because the corresponding keys do not physically exist or because a different keyboard layout is being used) and therefore would be impossible to type by a user.

This requires multiple steps: 1. reading the current echo state, 2. switching echo off, 3. reading the input, 4. switching echo state back to the original state.  ? The execute permission is enforced by a separate program, the program loader, by refusing to invoke the interpreter (possibly a shell) specified by the script's hashbang. The interpreter does not enforce the execute permission if invoked directly as the program loader would, with the file as an argument; this only requires read permission, as does piping the file as input to the interpreter, in which case the interpreter cannot see the execute permission.  - !POSIX shell ? - !bash (v4.0) ? - !csh ? - !tcsh ? - !Hamilton C shell  - !Scsh ? - !ksh (ksh93t+) ? - !pdksh ? - !zsh ? - !ash ? - !CCP  - !COMMAND.COM  (only under DR- DOS, prompts for password if file/directory is protected) (only under DR- DOS via syntax)Under DR-DOS the password separator for file and directory passwords is a semicolon.

Under 4DOS, the password separator must be doubled for all commands supporting include lists in order to distinguish passwords from include lists. Commands not supporting include lists accept both forms. DR-DOS 7.02 and higher optionally accept a doubled semicolon as well, so that doubled semicolons work under both COMMAND.COM and 4DOS regardless of the command executed.  (only under DR-DOS, if files are password-protected for read and/or execute permission)DR-DOS supports file passwords for read/write/delete and optionally execute permissions.

PowerShell script files ( files) are by default associated with the Notepad editor, not with the PowerShell execution engine. Invoking a file will launch Notepad rather than executing the script.  Startup scripts per computer/user can import modules and expose a subset the commands/functions available in the modules.  - !rc ? - !BeanShell ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - !VMS DCL  - !fish ?  ? }  Secure prompt  Some shell scripts need to query the user for sensitive information such as passwords, private digital keys, PIN codes or other confidential information. Sensitive input should not be echoed back to the screen/input device where it could be gleaned by unauthorized persons. Plaintext memory representation of sensitive information should also be avoided as it could allow the information to be compromised, e.g., through swap files, core dumps etc. The shells bash, zsh and PowerShell offer this as a specific feature. Shells which do not offer this as a specific feature may still be able to turn off echoing through some other means. Shells executing on a Unix/Linux operating system can use the external command to switch off/on echoing of input characters. In addition to not echoing back the characters, PowerShell's option also encrypts the input character-by-character during the input process, ensuring that the string is never represented unencrypted in memory where it could be compromised through memory dumps, scanning, transcription etc.  Encrypted variables/parameters  If a script reads a password into an environment variable it is in memory in plain text, and thus may be accessed via a core dump. It is also in the process environment, which may be accessible by other processes started by the script. PowerShell can work with encrypted string variables/parameters. Encrypted variables ensure that values are not inadvertently disclosed through e.g. transcripts, echo'ing, logfiles, memory or crash dumps or even malicious memory scanning. PowerShell also supports saving of such encrypted strings in text files, protected by a key owned by the current user.  Execute permission  Some operating systems define an execute permission which can be granted to users/groups for a file. On Unix systems, the execute permission controls access to invoking the file as a program, and applies both to executables and scripts. As the permission is enforced in the program loader, no obligation is needed from the invoking program, nor the invoked program, in enforcing the execute permission this also goes for shells and other interpreter programs. The behaviour is mandated by the POSIX C library that is used for interfacing with the kernel. POSIX specifies that the \`exec\` family of functions shall fail with EACCESS (permission denied) if the file denies execution permission (see ). The execute permission only applies when the script is run directly. If a script is invoked as an argument to the interpreting shell, it will be executed regardless of whether the user holds the execute permission for that script. Although Windows also specifies an execute permission, none of the Windows-specific shells block script execution if the permission has not been granted.  Untrusted script blocking  Some shells will block scripts determined to be untrustworthy, or refuse to run scripts if mandated by a system administrator. = Script origin execution restriction = PowerShell can be set to block execution of scripts which has been marked as obtained from an unknown/untrusted origin (e.g. the Internet). Internet facing applications such as web browsers, IM clients, mail readers etc. mark files downloaded from the internet with the origin zone in an alternate data stream which is understood by PowerShell. = Signed script restriction = Script/code signing policies can be used to ensure that an operations department only run approved scripts/code which have been reviewed and signed by a trusted reviewer/approver. Signing regimes also protects against tampering. If a script is sent from vendor to a client, the client can use signing to ensure that the script has not been tampered with during transit and that the script indeed originates from the vendor and not an attacker trying to social engineer an operator into running an attack script. PowerShell can be set to allow execution of otherwise blocked scripts (e.g. originating from an untrusted zone) if the script has been digitally signed using a trusted digital certificate. = Multilevel execution policies = A company may want to enforce execution restriction globally within the company and/or certain parts of the company. It may want to set a policy for running signed scripts but allow certain parts of the company to set their own policies for zoned restrictions. PowerShell allows script blocking policies to be enforced at multiple levels: Local machine, current user etc. A higher level policy overrides a lower level policy, e.g. if a policy is defined for the local machine it is in place for all users of the local machine, only if it is left undefined at the higher level can it be defined for the lower levels.  Restricted shell subset  Several shells can be started or be configured to start in a mode where only a limited set of commands and actions is available to the user. While not a security boundary (the command accessing a resource is blocked rather than the resource) this is nevertheless typically used to restrict users' actions before logging in. A restricted mode is part of the POSIX specification for shells, and most of the Linux/Unix shells support such a mode where several of the built-in commands are disabled and only external commands from a certain directory can be invoked. PowerShell supports restricted modes through session configuration files or session configurations. A session configuration file can define visible (available) cmdlets, aliases, functions, path providers and more.  Safe data subset  Scripts that invoke other scripts can be a security risk as they can potentially execute foreign code in the context of the user who launched the initial script. Scripts will usually be designed to exclusively include scripts from known safe locations; but in some instances, e.g. when offering the user a way to configure the environment or loading localized messages, the script may need to include other scripts/files. One way to address this risk is for the shell to offer a safe subset of commands which can be executed by an included script. PowerShell data sections can contain constants and expressions using a restricted subset of operators and commands. PowerShell data sections are used when e.g. localized strings needs to be read from an external source while protecting against unwanted side effects.

Freis (May 13, 1912 ‚Äì February 1, 2005) was an American physician and researcher, who received the Albert Lasker Award for his studies of the treatment of hypertension. Early life Edward David Freis was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 3, 1912 to Lithuanian immigrants Roy and Rose Freis. He had his eyes set on becoming an actor, but after a few shows, he realized that acting was not for him, and he decided to become a doctor. Freis obtained his BS from the University of Arizona in 1936, and his M.D. from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. After graduation, an internship, and a one-year residency in Boston-area hospitals, he joined the United States Army Air Corps, serving as assistant chief, then chief, of the laboratory service at Lincoln Air Force Base from 1942-1944, and the laboratory service for the USAAF Rheumatic Fever Research Program at Gowen Field from 1944-1945. When the war ended, Freis returned to Boston, completing another residency and a research fellowship at Evans Memorial Hospital, where he worked under Robert Wilkins. Career Freis met Doctor Chester Keefer, who had done penicillin trials, and decided that he wanted to become a researcher. He went to work for the United States Veterans Affairs Administration in Washington, DC, specializing in the study of hypertension. In 1949, Freis was appointed Assistant Chief of the Medical Service, and also served as an adjunct Clinical Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University. He later served as director of the Cardiovascular Research Laboratory and chief of the Hypertension Clinic at Georgetown. In 1954, Freis was promoted to chief of the VA Medical Service, and in 1959, he was also named Senior Medical Investigator. In the early 20th century, hypertension was not considered a disease, but a normal part of aging. In fact, it was felt by the medical community that high blood pressure was a good thing, because it improved circulation. Even so, there was no reliable way to lower high blood pressure until the 1940s. But Freis's studies, first published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1954 then later expanded in the 1960s, showed that hypertension actually increased the likelihood of stroke and heart attack. The 1960s study lasted five years (1964-1969), and was designed to determine whether treatment of hypertension would help prevent death and injury from complications due to stroke, kidney damage, congestive heart failure, and heart attack. The study found that treatment dramatically decreased the number of strokes, congestive heart failure, and kidney damage, but did not prevent heart attacks and sudden cardiac death. The study was one of the first randomized, double-blind, multi-institutional clinical trials ever done in the United States. The study was published in 1970 with little excitement from the scientific and medical community. However, Freis was awarded the Lasker Award in 1971 for his studies, cited for \\"an exemplary demonstration of the potential of preventive medicine.\\" After this study, Freis continued to manage cooperative studies on hypertension, and was recognized as a foremost authority on hypertension by his fellow researchers. His book with Gina Kolata, The High Blood Pressure Book, won the American Heart Association Howard Blakeslee award in 1980.

The resolution was drafted by the United States and co-sponsored by Spain and the United Kingdom; it was approved by 14 of 15 Security Council members as Syria did not participate in the voting. Resolution=Observations The Security Council reaffirmed the importance of the disarmament of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own political future and control of their natural resources. It encouraged efforts to form a representative government to afford equal rights and justice to all Iraqi citizens, and recalled Resolution 1325 (2000) on women to that effect. Furthermore, the Council determined that the United Nations should play a vital role in humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts and the development of institutions in Iraq. It welcomed the resumption of humanitarian efforts and the appointment of a Special Adviser by the Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Meanwhile, the preamble of the resolution affirmed the need for accountability for the crimes committed by the previous Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein and respect for Iraqi heritage. The Council recognised the responsibilities and obligations of the United Kingdom and United States as occupying powers and of other states that were not occupying powers as working under their command. It welcomed the commitment of Member States towards the stability of Iraq, remained concerned about the fate of Kuwaiti and third-state nationals unaccounted for since 2 August 1990 (the day Iraq invaded Kuwait) and determined that the situation in Iraq remained a threat to international peace and security. Acts The resolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, resolved many of the legal and governmental ambiguities that resulted from the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. and U.K.-led \\"coalition of the willing\\". Its three most important features are that it recognized the US-UK coalition's responsibilities under applicable international law as occupying powers; recognised the creation of a transitional governing council of Iraqis; and removed all sanctions against Iraq that were placed upon the former regime of Saddam Hussein under resolutions 661 (1991), 778 (1992) and others. Additionally, it terminated the Oil-for-Food Programme. The resolution transferred the authority to authorize expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue from the United Nations to a Development Fund for Iraq, controlled by the Coalition Provisional Authority, on 23 May 2003. It also created an international body to monitor the Coalition's expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB). The Coalition's authority to expend Iraq's oil revenue was conditional. The Coalition was only authorized to expend those funds for the benefit of the Iraqi people. Those expenditures were only authorized if they were made in an open and transparent manner. The Coalition was only authorized to expend funds so long as they cooperated in the IAMB's oversight of those expenditures, and the Coalition was charged with the obligation to make those expenditures with meaningful Iraqi input. The Oil- for-Food Program's remaining funds of $10 billion were transferred over a 6-month winding-up period to the Development Fund for Iraq, representing 14% of the program's total income over 5 years. The Coalition was widely criticized for failing to implement adequate financial controls; with failing to make expenditures from the Development Fund for Iraq in an open and transparent manner.

He was convicted in 1974 of charges of conspiracy in the murder of opponent Joseph A. Yablonski, his wife Margaret, and their daughter Charlotte, on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1969. After an appeal, his conviction and sentence were upheld at a second trial; he was sentenced to three life terms and died while still incarcerated. Yablonski had opposed Boyle for some time, arguing for more democratic representation among the locals, and had run against him in a bitter presidency election of the UMWA earlier in December, which Boyle won. Yablonski charged that fraud had been committed, asking for a Department of Labor investigation, and also filing five lawsuits against the union on specific related civil charges. Early years Boyle was born in a gold mining camp in Bald Butte, Montana (about two miles southwest of Marysville), in 1904 to James and Catherine (Mallin) Boyle. His father was a miner. The Boyle family was of Irish descent, and several generations of Boyles had worked as miners in England and Scotland. Boyle attended public schools in Montana and Idaho before graduating from high school. He went to work in the mines alongside his father. Shortly thereafter, Boyle's father died from tuberculosis, a lung disease often associated with mining, or exacerbated by its conditions. Marriage Boyle married Ethel Williams in 1928; they had a daughter, Antoinette. Career Boyle joined the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) soon after going to work in the mines. He was appointed president of District 27 (which covers Montana) and served in that capacity until 1948. During World War II, Boyle served on several government wartime production boards, and on the Montana State Unemployment Compensation Commission. In 1948, UMWA president John L. Lewis named Boyle as his assistant in the UMWA. He served until 1960, acting as Lewis' chief trouble-shooter and the union's chief administrator. Lewis simultaneously appointed him director of UMWA District 50 and regional director of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for four Western states. Presidency of UMWA Boyle was elected vice president of UMWA in 1960. That same year, Lewis retired and 73-year-old Thomas Kennedy assumed leadership of the union. Kennedy had been vice president since 1947. Although Lewis favored Boyle as his successor, Kennedy was well liked and well known. Kennedy was in failing health, however, and Boyle took over many of the president's duties. In November 1962, Kennedy became too frail and ill to continue his duties. Boyle was named acting- president. Kennedy died on January 19, 1963. Boyle was elected president shortly thereafter, obviously Lewis's handpicked choice. From the beginning of his tenure, Boyle faced significant opposition from rank-and-file miners and UMWA leaders. Miners' attitudes about their union had changed. Miners wanted greater democracy and more local autonomy for their local unions. There was a widespread belief that Boyle was more concerned with protecting mine owners' interests than those of his members. Grievances filed by the union often took months‚Äîsometimes years‚Äîto resolve, lending credence to the critics' claim. Wildcat strikes occurred as local unions, despairing of UMWA assistance, sought to resolve local disputes with walkouts. Yablonski challenge and murder In 1969, Joseph \\"Jock\\" Yablonski challenged Boyle for the presidency of UMWA. Yablonski had been president of UMWA District 5 (an appointed position) until Boyle had removed him in 1965. In an election widely seen as corrupt, Boyle defeated Yablonski in the election held on December 9 by a margin of nearly two-to-one (80,577 to 46,073). Although Boyle won, the election was the first time since 1920 that the incumbents had less than 80 percent or more of the vote, or that there was any opposition at all. Observers expected the union to make changes in response to the growing insurgency movement and demands for change. Yablonski conceded the election, but on December 18, 1969, asked the United States Department of Labor (DOL) to investigate the election for fraud. He also initiated five lawsuits against UMWA in federal court.The suits alleged that Boyle and UMWA had denied him use of the union's mailing lists as provided for by law, that he had been removed from his position as acting director of Labor's Non-Partisan League in retaliation for his candidacy, that the UMW Journal was being used by Boyle as a campaign and propaganda mouthpiece, that UMWA had no rules for fair elections and printed nearly 51,000 excess ballots which should be destroyed, and that UMWA had violated its fiduciary duties by spending union funds on Boyle's re-election. These charges and their resolution are outlined in Kenneth J. Yablonski and Joseph A. Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America et al., 466 F.2d 424 (August 3, 1972). On December 31, 1969, three killers shot Yablonski, his wife, Margaret, and his 25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, as they slept in the Yablonski home in Clarksville, Pennsylvania. The bodies were discovered on January 5, 1970, by Yablonski's eldest son, Kenneth. Boyle was found to have ordered Yablonski's death months earlier, on June 23, 1969, after a meeting with his opponent at UMWA headquarters had degenerated into a screaming match. In September 1969, UMWA executive council member Albert Pass received $20,000 from Boyle (who had embezzled the money from union funds) to hire assassins to kill Yablonski. Paul Gilly, an out-of-work house painter and son-in-law of a minor UMWA official, and two drifters, Aubran Martin and Claude Vealey, agreed to do the job. Pass arranged for the murder to be postponed until after the election, to avoid suspicion falling on Boyle.\\"The Yablonski Contract,\\" Time, May 15, 1972; \\"The Fall of Tony Boyle\\", Time, September 17, 1973; Lewis, Murder By Contract, 1975. Overturned election and defeat Yablonski's murder acted as a catalyst for the federal investigation already requested. On January 8, 1970, Yablonski's attorney requested an immediate investigation of the 1969 election by DOL. The Department of Labor had taken no action on Yablonski's complaints in the brief time since his December request. After the murders, Labor Secretary George P. Shultz assigned 230 investigators to the UMWA investigation. The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) of 1959 regulates the internal affairs of labor unions, requiring regular secret-ballot elections for local union offices and providing for federal investigation of election fraud or impropriety. DOL is authorized under the act to sue in federal court to have the election overturned. By 1970, however, only three international union elections had been overturned by the courts.\\"Vindication for Jock Yablonski\\", Time, March 16, 1970. Meanwhile, a reform group, Miners for Democracy (MFD), had formed in April 1970 while the DOL investigation continued. Its members included most of the miners who belonged to the West Virginia Black Lung Association and many of Yablonski's supporters and campaign staff. The chief organizers of Miners for Democracy included Yablonski's sons, Ken and [Joseph \\"Chip\\" YablonskiJoseph (known as \\"Chip\\"), both labor attorneys; Mike Trbovich, a union leader, and others.\\"Oral History Interview With Dr. Donald Rasmussen\\", March 1, 2004. DOL filed suit in federal court in 1971 to overturn the 1969 UMWA election. On May 1, 1972, Judge William B. Bryant threw out the results of the 1969 UMWA international union elections. Bryant scheduled a new election to be held over the first eight days of December 1972. Additionally, Bryant agreed that DOL should oversee the election, to ensure fairness.Hodgson v. United Mine Workers Of America, 344 F. Supp. 17 (May 1, 1972) Over the weekend of May 26 to May 28, 1972, MFD delegates gathered in Wheeling, West Virginia, nominated Arnold Miller, a former miner and leader of a black-lung organization, as their candidate for the presidency of UMWA.Wiater, \\"Top MFD Position Goes to Miller\\", Wheeling Intelligencer, May 29, 1972. On December 22, 1972, the Labor Department certified Miller as UMWA's next president. The vote was 70,373 for Miller and 56,334 for Boyle. Miller was the first candidate to defeat an incumbent president in UMWA history, and the first native West Virginian to lead the union. Convictions and death In early March 1971, Boyle was indicted for embezzling $49,250 in union funds to make illegal campaign contributions in the 1968 presidential race. He was convicted in December 1973 to a three-year sentence and imprisoned at the federal penitentiary in Springfield, Missouri. On September 6, 1973, Boyle was arrested on first degree murder charges in the deaths of Jock Yablonski and his family. That month, Boyle attempted suicide but failed. National attention had been riveted on the investigations into the conspiracy to slay labor leader Joseph A. Yablonski. A nationwide FBI investigation produced sufficient evidence to charge three Cleveland-area residents with conspiracy to slay Yablonski. Through Grand Jury proceedings, a series of three conspiracy indictments were returned, charging five individuals. The investigation was conducted by U.S. Attorney Robert B. Krupansky, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Jones (Ohio lawyer). Finally documentation and witnesses led to Boyle: ‚ÄúTONY BOYLE CHARGED IN YABLONSKI KILLING‚Äù they screamed on September 6th, 1973. His trial lasted from 25 March until April 11, 1974, when he was convicted. He was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life in prison. On January 28, 1977, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned Boyle's conviction and ordered that he be given a new trial. The court found that the trial judge had improperly refused to allow a government auditor to testify. Boyle's attorneys said that the auditor's testimony could have exonerated Boyle.Boyle's attorneys argued that UMWA executive board member Albert Pratt and District 19 president William Turnblazer had murdered Yablonski so he would not expose their embezzlement of union funds. On January 16, 1978 Boyle‚Äôs murder retrial was set to resume. He had been convicted, but the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court had set aside the convictions on grounds Boyle was denied the right to present a complete defense. Boyle was tried a second time for the Yablonski slayings and found guilty on February 18, 1978. Boyle filed a third appeal to overturn his conviction in July 1979, but the motion was denied. Boyle served his murder sentence at State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Dallas in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. He suffered from a number of stomach and heart ailments in his final years and was repeatedly hospitalized. He had a stroke in 1983. He died at a hospital in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on May 31, 1985, aged 80. In popular culture Barbara Kopple's 1976 documentary Harlan County USA included a segment on Yablonski's murder and its aftermath. It also includes the song \\"Cold Blooded Murder\\" (also known as \\"The Yablonski Murder\\"), sung by Hazel Dickens. The murders were also portrayed in a 1986 HBO television movie, Act of Vengeance. Charles Bronson (a native of Ehrenfeld, in the western Pennsylvania mining region) portrayed Yablonski and Wilford Brimley played Boyle.\\"News of the Screen,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1973; Schenider, \\"This Time Around, Bronson Portrays the Victim,\\" New York Times, April 20, 1986.

The monastery and its adjacent church, San Giovanni (constructed in 1335), was the home base to native-born Augustinian cleric Leonardo da Vallazzana (known as Leonardo da Fivizzano) whose oratorical skills captivated Lorenzo the Magnificent and church goers throughout Florence and were used to formally announce the excommunication of the Dominican cleric Savonarola. The monastery was also the home of Alessio Cassani (subject of the University of Pisa thesis of Sandro Bondi, previous mayor of Fivizzano and former Minister of Culture), a friar accused of heresy for hiding within the monastery numerous writings favorable to Luther. * The Museum of San Giovanni, built within the ruins of the church of San Giovanni and adjacent to the foundations of the Augustinian monastery.

It had two leagues of 18 teams each (A and B) at the same level. This competition, originally known as the Belgian Promotion () was first played in the 1926-27 season with three leagues, then with four leagues between 1931 and 1952. From 1952 on, only two leagues remained and the competition was named the Third Division. Originally set to 16 clubs, the number of clubs in each division was increased in 2009 to 18 clubs. At the end of the regular season, both league winners promoted to the second division and a play-off was played to determine a possible third club to promote. The champion of the third division was determined after a two-legged match between the winners of the two leagues. If those matches ended in a draw, a third match was played on a neutral ground. However, in recent years this final game was not organised anymore due to lack of interest. In 2016, the Belgian Third Division was replaced by the Belgian Second Amateur Division. Competition format and naming=Competition The competition consisted of the regular season (two leagues of 18 teams, 34 matchdays each) followed by the third division play-off (7 teams, 3 matchdays). Each team played 34 matches during the regular season (from August till May). The regular season was divided in 3 periods with the first period consisting of the first 10 match days, the second period consisting of the next 12 match days and the third period consisting of the final 12 match days. For each period in each league, a ranking was computed in the same way as the overall league rankings (three points for a win, one point for a draw and no point for a loss). In each league, the winner of the regular season promoted to the second division and the two worst-placed teams (17th and 18th) were relegated to the Belgian Fourth Division. The 16th placed teams had to play the Promotion play-off with teams from Promotion (see Fourth Division playoff). The three period winners in each league qualified for the third division play-off along with the 16th- placed team in the second division. If the league winner also won one or more periods or that a period winner won more than one period, finished in the last three places or had not received a second division license, the best-placed teams in the league overall ranking qualified for the play-off so that 3 teams in each league qualified. The playoff was played in three rounds. In the first round, the 6 qualifiers from the third division ware drawn in three matches played in two legs. The winners of the first round and the 16th-placed team from the second division entered the second round (2 matches played in two legs). The final round was also played in two legs. The winner qualified for the second division. In each round, the away goals rule was used to declare the winner in case of aggregate tie score. If each team had scored the same number of away goals, the teams played extra time of two 15-minutes periods. If there was still a tie, the away goals rule was applied once again. Finally, the matches went to penalties. As a part of changes in the Belgian league system that were implemented in 2016, when the third division was rebranded as Second Amateur Division, the 2015‚Äì16 season had 37 teams (one division has 19 and the other, 18) and the division contracted to 16 teams. The three-period rankings and promotion playoff between third and fourth tier teams were scrapped. The 7th to 17th (or 18th) placers in each group remained in the division, which is called Belgian Second Amateur Division and now lies at the fourth level of the Belgian football pyramid, while the last placers relegated to the new fifth level called Belgian Third Amateur Division. From the 2016‚Äì17 season onwards, the Belgian First Amateur Division is made up of nine teams relegated from the 2015‚Äì16 Belgian Second Division, the 2015‚Äì16 champion and runner-up of each Third Division group, and three winners of a qualifying playoff contested by 3rd to 6th ranked teams.

In mathematical knot theory, the Hopf link is the simplest nontrivial link with more than one component.. It consists of two circles linked together exactly once, and is named after Heinz Hopf. Geometric realization A concrete model consists of two unit circles in perpendicular planes, each passing through the center of the other.. See in particular p. 77. This model minimizes the ropelength of the link and until 2002 the Hopf link was the only link whose ropelength was known.. The convex hull of these two circles forms a shape called an oloid.. Properties Depending on the relative orientations of the two components the linking number of the Hopf link is ¬±1., p. 21. The Hopf link is a (2,2)-torus link. with the braid word, Exercise 5.22, p. 133. :\\\\sigma_1^2.\\\\, The knot complement of the Hopf link is R √ó S1 √ó S1, the cylinder over a torus.. This space has a locally Euclidean geometry, so the Hopf link is not a hyperbolic link. The knot group of the Hopf link (the fundamental group of its complement) is Z2 (the free abelian group on two generators), distinguishing it from an unlinked pair of loops which has the free group on two generators as its group.. The Hopf-link is not tricolorable. This is easily seen from the fact that the link can only take on two colors that leads it to fail the second part of the definition of tricoloribility. At each crossing, it will take a maximum of 2 colors. Thus, if it satisfies the rule of having more than 1 color, it fails the rule of having 1 or 3 color at each crossing. If it satisfies the rule of having 1 or 3 colors at each crossing, it will fail the rule of having more than 1 color. Hopf bundle The Hopf fibration is a continuous function from the 3-sphere (a three-dimensional surface in four-dimensional Euclidean space) into the more familiar 2-sphere, with the property that the inverse image of each point on the 2-sphere is a circle. Thus, these images decompose the 3-sphere into a continuous family of circles, and each two distinct circles form a Hopf link. This was Hopf's motivation for studying the Hopf link: because each two fibers are linked, the Hopf fibration is a nontrivial fibration. This example began the study of homotopy groups of spheres..  Biology  The Hopf link is also present in some proteins. It consists of two covalent loops, formed by pieces of protein backbone, closed with disulfide bonds. The Hopf link topology is highly conserved in proteins and adds to their stability. History Buzan-ha crest The Hopf link is named after topologist Heinz Hopf, who considered it in 1931 as part of his research on the Hopf fibration.. However, in mathematics, it was known to Carl Friedrich Gauss before the work of Hopf.. It has also long been used outside mathematics, for instance as the crest of Buzan-ha, a Japanese Buddhist sect founded in the 16th century.

They travelled to their new home in Detroit by train. Douglas was deeply influenced by the Great Depression. His father was out of work for long periods, and he admitted that the poverty and social disorder that he witnessed changed his life. He dropped out of high school when he was 18, worked in a machine shop, and took several jobs in the automobile industry. Early union career Fraser eventually found work as a metal finisher in one of Chrysler's DeSoto factories, where he became active in the union in 1936. He was twice fired for his union beliefs and activities and participated sitdown strikes at Chrysler. Fraser was elected president of UAW Local 227 in 1943, and served in the US Army during World War II. After the war, Fraser quickly rose through the ranks in the UAW. He was appointed an international representative in 1947. During a difficult 104-day strike at Chrysler in 1950, he deeply impressed UAW staff with his negotiating skills.David Gartman, Auto Slavery: The Labor Process in the American Automobile Industry, 1897-1950, New Brunswick, N.J., l Rutgers University Press, 1986, ; Steve Jefferys, Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler, New York, Cambridge University Press, 1986, He joined the personal staff of UAW President Walter Reuther in 1951, where he was a personal administrative assistant to Reuther. In 1959, he was elected co- director of UAW Region 1A, and a member-at-large of the international UAW board of directors in 1962. Reuther soon thereafter appointed him director of the UAW's Chrysler, Skilled Trades, and Technical, Office and Professional Departments. He was elected a vice-president of the international union in 1970. As a key member of Reuther's staff, Fraser was involved in a number of successful collective bargaining agreements, early retirement program in 1964, and wage parity for both US and Canadian members in 1967. Reuther died in a plane crash during the 1970 contract talks, leading many to speculate that Fraser might be tapped to lead the union. However, after a deeply-divided vote of the UAW executive council voted 13-to-12 against him, Fraser withdrew his name, and Leonard Woodcock became union president.Nelson Lichtenstein, The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit: Walter Reuther and the Fate of American Labor, Urbana, Ill., University of Illinois Press, 1997, David R.

Fraser led a nine-day strike against Chrysler that began on September 14, 1973, the first against the automaker in decades. The collective bargaining agreement hammered out five days later and ratified on September 23 contained restrictions on mandatory overtime, a comprehensive health-and-safety program, significant improvement to the early retirement plan, and a new dental care benefit. A new streamlined arbitration process was also negotiated, which reduced the time for resolving grievances.\\"Surprise Strike at Chrysler,\\" Time, September 24, 1973; \\"Chrysler Picked as U.A.W.

He was elected president after Woodcock had reached the mandatory retirement age of 65, according to the UAW constitution. He is best known for his role in negotiating a greater voice for the union in corporate governance with Chrysler during the company's 1979 bankruptcy crisis and subsequent government-sponsored loan. Fraser mobilized UAW members and heavily lobbied Congress in a move that proved critical to convincing the government to provide $1.2 billion in federally- guaranteed loans, which enabled Chrysler to avoid bankruptcy. He used Reuther's \\"equality of sacrifice\\" formula to convince UAW members that major concessions were needed to save the company. Fraser then negotiated wage cuts of $3 an hour and waived restrictions on layoffs, which allowed Chrysler to shed nearly 50,000 jobs, about half its workforce. In an unprecedented move, Chrysler Corporation named Fraser to its Board of Directors on which he served from 1980 to 1984. He had pressed for automobile manufacturers to put UAW members on their boards in 1976. He was the first labor leader to sit on the board of directors of an important American company.William F. Morrison, The Savvy Negotiator: Building Win/Win Relationships, New York, Praeger Publishers, 2005, Fraser and UAW shop committee, ca. 1981 Fraser negotiated another round of concessionary contracts in 1982. The early 1980s recession hit the Ford Motor Company particularly hard. To help save the company, Fraser negotiated significant wage and benefit cuts. The same wage concessions were given to General Motors, as Fraser sought to keep wages uniform across the industry to avoid giving one company a cost advantage over another. Some deeply criticized Fraser's 1979 negotiations, however. They argued that the Chrysler agreement set off a wave of concessionary bargaining among automobile manufacturers that then spread into steel, mining, trucking, meatpacking, airlines and rubber. They also claim that a thirty-year truce between labor and management broke down after 1979, leading automobile manufacturers to abandon pattern bargaining and seek an end to job protections and cost-of- living increases. Social activism Fraser was active in politics his entire life. A Democrat, he was an unabashed liberal. Socially progressive, he was a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. He defied most UAW in his strong support of desegregation busing in public schools. Despite resistance from both staff and members, he began initiatives within the UAW and the auto industry to recruit more minorities and women. He also pushed for national health insurance. Retirement Fraser retired as UAW president in 1983. He was an adjunct professor at Wayne State University for many years, teaching labor relations and labor history. A major research and study center, the Douglas A. Fraser Center for Workplace Issues, was named after him. Fraser received The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence for his significant contributions to life in America. Death Douglas Fraser died on February 23, 2008, of complications from emphysema at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan.

The party was founded on 2 December 1995 from a merger of the Estonian National Independence Party and the Pro Patria National Coalition. On 4 April 2006, representatives of the Pro Patria Union and the representatives of Res Publica decided to merge the two parties. The merger was approved by the general assemblies of both parties in P√§rnu on 4 June 2006. Although originally the name For Estonia (Eesti Eest) was considered for the united party, it was rejected. New party was officially registered on 15 October 2006 under the name Pro Patria and Res Publica Union.http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?0558894 Res Publica ja Isamaaliit √ºhinevad According to party statements, the programme was based on Christian democracy and nationalism. Together with its predecessors the Pro Patria Union was the main force behind the economic and legal reforms in the Republic of Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s. A party of an identical name existed before the Second World War.  In government and opposition  Mart Laar, a historian, former Chairman of the National Alliance \\"Pro Patria\\" and Prime Minister of Estonia from 1992 to 1994 was elected the new Chairman of the party on 24 October 1998. The party was successful on the parliamentary elections of 1999, receiving 18 seats. Its leader Mart Laar became Prime Minister again. His coalition government was in office till 28 January 2002. The Pro Patria Union was a member of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (EPP-ED). The party had one seat in the European Parliament, held by Tunne Kelam, the Chairman of the Pro Patria Union from 7 December 2002 to 16 April 2005. In parliamentary elections in 2003 they won 7 seats in Riigikogu and joined the opposition. T√µnis Lukas was elected chairman of the party on 16 April 2005. Historian and archivist Aimar Altosaar was re-elected Secretary General in 2005, having served in the same position from 1996 to 1999. The party had an official newspaper called \\"Trib√º√ºn\\" (The Tribune). It was established in 2001. For the local elections in autumn 2005 the Pro Patria Union signed a cooperation agreement with two minor parties: Union of Farmers (P√µllumeeste Kogu) on 6 July 2005 and with Estonian Democratic Party (Eesti Demokraatlik Partei) on 12 July 2005. The local elections on 16 October 2005 showed a growing support for the party. The presence of the Pro Patria Union grew from 0 to 7 seats in Tallinn City Council and remained the same (9 seats) in Tartu City Council.

Australia Pastoral leases exist in both Australian commonwealth law and state jurisdictions. They do not give all the rights that attach to freehold land: there are usually conditions which include a time period and the type of activity permitted. According to Austrade, such leases cover about 44% of mainland Australia (), mostly in arid and semi-arid regions and the tropical savannahs. They usually allow people to use the land for grazing traditional livestock, but more recently have been also used for non-traditional livestock (such as kangaroos or camels), tourism and other activities. Management of the leases falls mainly to state and territory governments. Under Commonwealth of Australia law, applicable only in the Northern Territory, they are agreements that allow for the use of Crown land by farmers, etc. In the Australian states, leases constitute a land apportionment system created in the mid-19th century to facilitate the orderly division and sale of land to European colonists. Leases within state jurisdictions have variations as to applicability from state to state. Native title can co-exist with pastoral leases, and Indigenous Land Use Agreements may be made between the leaseholder and the affected native title group. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has conducted research on pastoral lands in the terms of the lands as rangelands on a country-wide basis.

Kodok is the capital of Shilluk country, formally known as the Shilluk Kingdom. Shilluk has been an independent kingdom for more than sixteen centuries. Fashoda is best known as the place where the British and French nearly went to war in 1898 in the Fashoda Incident. According to Shilluk belief, religion, tradition and constitution, Fashoda serves as the mediating city for the Shilluk King. It is a place where ceremonies and the coronation of each new Shilluk King takes place. For over 500 years, Fashoda was kept hidden and acted as a forbidden city for the Shilluk King, but as modern educations and traditions emerge, Fashoda is now known to the outside world. Fashoda is believed to be a place where the spirit of Juok (God), the spirit of Nyikango (the founder of Shilluk Kingdom and the spiritual leader of Shilluk religion), the spirit of the deceased Shilluk kings and the spirit of the living Shilluk King come to mediate for the Kingdom of Shilluk's spiritual healing. Fashoda is preserved as a quiet place for the spirit of God, where the sounds and speeches of God (Juok) can be heard and received by the King, leaders, and elders. For the Shilluk, Fashoda is a city of mediation and peace. History Aturwic, the homestead mound of the Shilluk king at Pachodo (Fashoda) with his four huts built on top. Photo by Charles Gabriel Seligman Photograph of Fashoda by Charles Gabriel Seligman Historically, Fashoda is chiefly known for being the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident between the United Kingdom and France. The British were attempting to create a solid block of influence from southern Africa through East Africa to Egypt, which was already under British control. Meanwhile, the French were attempting to expand from West Africa along the southern border of the Sahara Desert in order to control all of the trade through the Sahel. The intersection of these lines of intended control passed through Kodok, and a standoff between armed expeditionary forces led the two countries to the brink of war. The outcome in Britain's favour contributed to the stabilisation of colonial claims and the eventual end of the 'Scramble for Africa'. The incident gave rise to what is known as the 'Fashoda syndrome' in French foreign policy. In 1904, the development of the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale prompted the British to change the town's name to Kodok (Kothok) in the hope of obliterating the memory of the incident. The Evangelical Church Mission Society (CMS) was assigned in 1898 by the British colonial administration to Kodok awarded to the missionary, after they had been denied the location of Khartoum. The Catholic Verona Fathers were also given the area west of the Nile and the Presbyterian Church (USA) the east to the Ethiopian border. From 1900, the missionaries were in low numbers and encountered territorial disputes, but in the 1920s, complaints were made by the CMS about the expansion of the Catholics on their territory. In January 1933, a Catholic Mission was established in Kodok and since 1974 has been classified under the Diocese of Malakal. From the 1930s, Kodok was also a centre of the Presbyterians, so Kodok has a major Christian influence. In 1955, the population of Kodok was about 9,100. During the First Sudanese Civil War in 1964, during the reign of Muhammad Ahmad Mahjub, Kodok was the scene of a massacre by the military in Khartoum. Similar massacres in 1964 and 1965 also took place in other cities in southern Sudan.South Sudan: A History of Political Domination ‚Äì A Case of Self-Determination, (Riek Machar) In the 1990s, Kodok suffered a serious famine and saw many charities brought to the region, especially Operation Lifeline Sudan. In the years 2004 and 2005, at the end of the Second Sudanese Civil War, many refugees returned but the security situation in 2004 was still very critical. Today the inhabitants of Kodok are mainly involved in subsistence farming and grow as a staple of their diet millet and rear cattle. From the mid-1990s they began marketing gum arabic, obtained from Acacia seyal and sold to Arab traders from the north. There are also ongoing local disputes in the area between Kodok and the south of Malakal on the Nile for land rights and water distribution.

Wadi Rum Protected Area was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011. Name Wadi Rum most likely gets it name from the early name of Iram of the Pillars. . History Desert camp for tourists in Wadi Rum Petroglyphs at Wadi Rum Wadi Rum has been inhabited by many human cultures since prehistoric times, with many cultures‚Äìincluding the Nabataeans‚Äìleaving their mark in the form of petroglyphs, inscriptions, and temple. In the West, Wadi Rum may be best known for its connection with British officer T. E. Lawrence, who passed through several times during the Arab Revolt of 1917-18. In the 1980s one of the rock formations in Wadi Rum, originally known as Jabal al-Mazmar (The Mountain of (the) Plague), was named \\"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" after Lawrence's book penned in the aftermath of the war, though the 'Seven Pillars' referred to in the book have no connection with Rum.The Seven Pillars? roughguides.com, accessed 19 June 2018 Lawrence described his entrance into the Valley of Rumm, \\"The hills on the right grew taller and sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles. The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than then body of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional way greater than imagination.\\" Lawrence also described his encounter with the spring, Ain Shalaaleh, \\"On the rock-bulge above were clear- cut Nabathaean inscriptions, and a sunk panel incised with a monogram or symbol. Around and about were Arab scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock. I looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served as an entrance. Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet square.\\" The discovery of the Nabataean Temple (located walking distance from the Rest House) in 1933 briefly returned the spotlight to the desert. A French team of archaeologists completed the excavations in 1997. Geography The area is centered on the main valley of Wadi Rum. The highest elevation in Jordan is Jabal Umm ad Dami at high (SRTM data states 1854 m), located 30 kilometres south of Wadi Rum village. It was first located by Difallah Ateeg, a Zalabia Bedouin from Rum. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Red Sea and the Saudi border from the top. Jabal Ram or Jebel Rum ( above sea level) is the second highest peak in Jordan and the highest peak in the central Rum, rising directly above Rum valley, opposite Jebel um Ishrin, which is possibly one metre lower. Khaz'ali Canyon in Wadi Rum is the site of petroglyphs etched into the cave walls depicting humans and antelopes dating back to the Thamudic times. The village of Wadi Rum itself consists of several hundred Bedouin inhabitants with their goat-hair tents and concrete houses and also their four-wheel vehicles, one school for boys and one for girls, a few shops, and the headquarters of the Desert Patrol. Recently, Geoff Lawton has achieved success in establishing a permaculture ecosystem in Wadi Rum.Craig Mackintosh: FROM DESERT TO OASIS IN 4 YEARS (JORDAN) 1 February 2014 permaculturenews.org, accessed 19 June 2018 Tourism Desert scenes of Wadi Rum in Lawrence of Arabia from 1962 kick-started Jordan's tourism industry.The Complete Guide to Lawrence's Arabia 22 May 2004, independent.co.uk, accessed 19 June 2018 Wadi Rum is one of Jordan's most popular tourist sites and attracts a number of foreign tourists. Wadi Rum is home to the Zalabieh tribe, who developed eco- adventure tourism and services throughout the protected area. They provide tours, guides, accommodation and facilities. They also run restaurants and small shops in the villages that provide meals and basic supplies for visitors. Their guide services include highly experienced mountain and trekking guides who have an unmatched knowledge of the local area and often speak fluently in one or two languages. Using local guides and services brings many benefits to the protected area. In particular, it enables people to continue earning a living from the land and helps to ensure that the protected area will always be protected. Popular activities in the desert environment include 4x4 tours, camel rides, camping under the stars, riding Arabian horses, hiking and rock-climbing among the massive rock formations. Travellers staying in the area can overnight in Bedouin Camps located in the desert and glamping hotels. Hikers and adventurous travellers may also opt to camp outdoors under the stars. Tour operators offering this experience provide sleeping equipment, meals and transport. Dima and Lama Hattab coordinate an annual marathon in the region called Jabal Ishrin. Rock climbing Climber on Jabal Ram Local Bedouin have climbed in the sandstone mountains of Wadi Rum for many generations. Many of their 'Bedouin Roads' have been rediscovered and documented by modern climbers. Several are included in the climbing guidebook by Tony Howard, and online by Li√™n and Gilles Rappeneau. In 1949, Sheikh Hamdan took surveyors to the summit of Jabal Ram. The first recorded European ascent of Jabal Ram took place in November 1952, by Charmian Longstaff and Sylvia Branford, guided by Sheik Hamdan. The first recorded rock climbs started in 1984, with the first of many visits by English climbers Howard, Baker, Taylor and Shaw. This group repeated many of the Bedouin routes, accompanied by locals and independently, including, in 1984, Hammad's Route on Jebel Rum, and, in 1985, Sheikh Kraim‚Äôs Hunter‚Äôs Slabs and Rijm Assaf on Jebel Rum. Many new routes were climbed in the 1980s, by this team, French guide Wilfried Colonna, by the Swiss Remy brothers, and by Haupolter and Precht. The first dedicated climbing guide book, Treks and Climb in Wadi Rum, by Tony Howard, was first published in 1987. Some of the many Bedouin routes have been documented online by Lien and Gilles Rappeneau. A new routes book for climbers is held at the Wadi Rum Guest House. The route Guerre Sainte was climbed in 2000 by Batoux, Petit and friends. This was the first route in Wadi Rum to be entirely equipped using bolt protection. The route, on the East Face of Jebel Nassarani North, is long, and graded F7b or F7aA0. Filming location The area has been used as a background setting in a number of films. Filmmakers are particularly drawn to it for science fiction films set on Mars. The Location Managers Guild recognized the Jordanian Royal Film Commission with its LMGI Award for Outstanding Film Commission in 2017 for its work on Rogue One, which filmed at Wadi Rum.

Daiy≈ç kangoku are detention cells found in police stations which are used as legal substitutes for detention centers, or prisons. The practical difference lies in the supervision of daiy≈ç kangoku by the police forces responsible for investigations, whereas detention centers are supervised by a professional corps of prison guards who are not involved in the investigative processes. Daiy≈ç kangoku came about to solve a shortage of prison cells in Japan in 1908. Though no shortage exists today, the practice has continued and has significant political support. It has been controversial, however, because of its role in eliciting confessions from criminal suspects. Controversy Suspects can be detained for an \\"interview\\" in a daiy≈ç kangoku for as many as seventy-two hours under the Code of Criminal Procedure. After this seventy- two-hour period, prosecutors can request a further ten days' detention of the suspect from a judge. These ten days are frequently used by the investigative authorities to gain confessions from the suspect. After the initial ten-day extension, the prosecutor can request a further ten days of detention from a judge, before the suspect must either be charged or released. Activists claim that requests for pre-trial detention after arrest are almost always granted by judges; in 1987, the rate of approval for all requests was 99.8% and that same year, 85% of arrested detainees were kept in daiy≈ç kangoku facilities for longer than seventy-two hours; more than a third of suspects were held without charge for longer than ten days by a judge's decision to extend the time limits. Activists also claim that authorities have a great deal of control over the suspect's well-being, and can restrict meals or access to family and that intensive interrogation practices are often used, and the condition of daiy≈ç kangoku are considered worse than those in Japanese regular detention centers. Japanese human rights and civil liberties activists in Japan have questioned whether this policy, which in sum allows 23 days of detention before charges must be brought, adequately protects suspects' rights. In practice, the detention may be indeterminate: the 23 days period can be repeated over and over by filing more charges. Defenders of the current system argue that under generally conservative prefectural policies, extraordinary proof must be obtained before an arrest can be made. Japanese prosecutors require beyond-reasonable-doubt proof for indictments, and often require a confession. Advocates of the daiy≈ç kangoku system argue that this culture of restraint among the authorities merits and even requires the ability to place uncharged suspects in prolonged detention. During an interview in the daiy≈ç kangoku, the suspect has the rights, under the Constitution, to counsel and to remain silent. But under the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Code of Criminal Procedure, suspects cannot end the interview‚Äîwhich is to say, the suspect cannot choose to leave the daiy≈ç kangoku until the interview is concluded. Japanese human rights and civil liberties advocates usually criticize this interpretation as offering the accused too few rights in daiy≈ç kangoku.

The NIR and ID cards were repealed in 2010 by the Identity Documents Act of that year; since then, it has been involved in other campaigns. History Meeting in London against ID cards, 2005. Left to right, the speakers are Tony Benn, Shami Chakrabarti, Mark Littlewood and George Galloway. NO2ID arose initially from various campaigning groups to become an entity in its own right. Its initial form was to act as an umbrella group including staff and officers of Liberty, Charter 88 (now Unlock Democracy), Privacy International, the Foundation for Information Policy Research, the 1990 Trust and Stand.org.uk.Stand: Defining Digital Freedoms In The UK NO2ID-branded material first appeared in 2002, published and paid for by Liberty and Charter 88. NO2ID's support is broad based including political parties on the political left (such as Respect and the Greens), in the centre (such as the Liberal Democrats) and on the right (such as the United Kingdom Independence Party and Conservative Future, though the Conservative Party has pledged to scrap the ID scheme). As well as civil liberties groups such as Liberty, Privacy International, Action on Rights for Children, the Open Rights Group and Genewatch UK, other organisations including trades unions (e.g. UNISON, the National Union of Journalists & the University and College Union) and public bodies including District, City and Borough Councils, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the London Assembly and individuals such as Neil Tennant, Philip Pullman, and Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson have affiliated to or made public declarations of support for the NO2ID campaign. Organisation NO2ID is a UK-wide membership organisation, supported by subscriptions, donations and some grant funding, mainly from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd. It has established and supports national and regional groups across the UK, one of the first being NO2ID Scotland, as well as a network of action-oriented local groups staffed entirely by volunteers. NO2ID grew rapidly during the initial Parliamentary battle against the UK ID cards legislation which, after the first Bill fell having failed to be passed before the general election in May 2005, was re- introduced and passed as the Identity Cards Act 2006 in March 2006. At that point, NO2ID had around 30,000 registered supporters and a network of around 100 other supportive organisations. A partial list of those organisations declaring public support can be found on the NO2ID website. As of December 2008, NO2ID had some 60,000 registered supporters and active groups in most major cities and many towns across the UK. Campaign NO2ID Pledge certificate NO2ID launched its public campaign with an online petition that gathered over 3,000 signatures in a little over four weeks, submitted just as the Labour Government introduced the first Identity Cards Bill in November 2004. In July 2005, NO2ID signed up over 10,000 people through PledgeBank, who pledged to refuse to accept an identity card and to contribute ¬£10 to a fund to provide legal support for those prosecuted for resisting registration. A second identical pledge was launched to try to double the number of people publicly committed to resisting registration, but this failed to gain traction. Over two years later, in November 2007, the Pledge was called in and during the first fortnight alone over ¬£40,000 was raised and put into a ring- fenced Legal Defence Fund. In May 2006, NO2ID launched the \\"Renew for Freedom\\" campaign, urging passport holders to renew their passports to delay being entered on the National Identity Register. This followed a comment made by Charles Clarke in the House of Commons that \\"anyone who feels strongly enough about the linkage [between passports and the ID scheme] not to want to be issued with an ID card in the initial phase will be free to surrender their existing passport and apply for a new passport before the designation order takes effect\\". UK Passport Office statistics published the following year suggest that between 30,000 and 40,000 people renewed their passport in the first month of the campaign. In September 2006, the NO2ID campaign started an appeal to track down the locations of the new outsourced Passport / National Identity Register \\"personal interview\\" registration centres at which the government planned to start face to face identity interviews. The project, named 'Authentication by Interview' (AbI), due to launch in October 2006, suffered a series of delays during which the campaign located 67 of the 69 interview centres - often revealing their location before Home Office ministers were able to do so in Parliamentary Answers. In November 2007, the campaign launched the NO2ID Pledge \\\\- a new form of non-violent direct action: pre-emptive resistance. The NO2ID Pledge, supported by public figures including Nick Clegg and Shirley Williams, encourages people to resolve publicly and clearly that they will not to do those specific things that give the ID scheme its \\"parasitic vitality\\". Repeal of the Identity Cards Act In September 2010, the Identity Documents Act 2010 was passed, repealing the Identity Cards Act 2006 and abolishing identity cards and the National Identity Register. At the introduction of the Identity Documents Bill by the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats coalition government in June 2010, former Home Secretary David Blunkett under whom the ID scheme began, acknowledged the success of the campaign: \\"I need to be contrite enough to congratulate Phil Booth from NO2ID, Dr Whitley from the London School of Economics identity project, and others, for the tremendous campaign that they have run, over the past five years in particular, to stop this scheme.\\" At Third Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons in September 2010, Home Office Minister Damian Green also acknowledged NO2ID's part in the abolition of the ID scheme, saying: \\"I also pay tribute to the NO2ID campaign, which can chalk itself up as one of the most successful pressure groups in history. It was formed less than 10 years ago, and within a decade of its formation it has achieved its principal aim.\\" Related campaigns During the course of its campaign against the database state, NO2ID has helped establish three other independent campaigns: TheBigOptOut.org and medConfidential campaigning for medical confidentiality and LeaveThemKidsAlone,LTKA - campaigning against the fingerprinting of UK schoolchildren a parent-led campaign against the fingerprinting of children in schools and nurseries.

Unlike the surrounding Kordofan, the uplands of the hills were quite moist and suitable to agriculture and a dense population. The state was centred upon the Taqali Massif the highest part of the hills in the northeast of the region. It early history is unclear. Oral traditions state it was founded many centuries ago at the same time as the Kingdom of Sennar came into being. Some scholars doubt these tales and believe that the state did not come into being until the late eighteenth century (between 1750 and 1780), and that the early rulers on the king list are semi-mythological. History It has been argued that the first true ruler of Taqali was Muhammad wad Jayli and that he and his son Ismail of Qaqali forged the state. Some believe it formed during the period of disorder in the Kordofan when the Kingdom of Sennar was declining and Darfur was growing in power. Muhammad began the process of uniting the region. He was succeeded as Makk by his brother Umar. Umar was overthrown, however, by Ajaid, the queen mother, and Ismail around 1783. Ismail took over and further expanded the state, taking control of the \\"99 hills\\" of the region. His son Abakr peacefully succeeded him, but after this the state was beset by conflicts over the succession through much of the period from 1840 to 1880. Despite its small size the Taqali state remained independent of its more powerful neighbours. While the Nuba Hills were well suited to agriculture they were surrounded by the arid Kordofan. This region was far too dry to support a large army and only small expeditions could be launched. The rocky terrain of the Taqali Massif served as natural fortifications. The Kingdom of Sennar exerted enough pressure that Taqali sent annual tribute, but never conquered the area. When Sennar was destroyed by the Egyptian invasion of 1821 the situation continued. The Egyptians launched three separate attacks against Taqali, but all of them failed. Eventually an agreement was reached whereby Taqali would remain de facto independent but would pay a nominal tribute and be officially included within the Egyptian Sudan. The state was finally conquered by the forces of the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad. Makk Adam prevaricated between the British and the forces of the Mahdi, professing his support for both but aiding neither. In 1883 the Mahdi decided that Taqali had to be conquered. The subsequent offensive advanced further than previous ones and in July 1884 Makk Adam was captured, and he eventually died in captivity. Insurrections continued in Taqali and Hamdan Abu Anja was dispatched to defeat the resistance. This was done though much pillaging and destruction of the region. With the defeat of the Mahdists the Makk of Taqali were restored to power, but they were now closely controlled by the British. Taqali proved a useful ally and the British gradually gave it more territory to control and administer. This continued with the independence of Sudan in 1956. The administrative power of the state was finally done away with after the 1969 coup. The Makk of Taqali, though having no political power, remains a ceremonial leader to the people of the region to this day. Royal family The title of the ruler of Taqali was Makk (or Mek, \\"king\\"), possibly Arabic but more like an Arabized word of Merotici or Ge'ez origin. The tributaries of the Makk of Taqali were known as muk≈´k al- øƒÅda (sing. makk al- øƒÅda), \\"customary kings\\". In Taqali, the son of a makk was a wad al-makk (pl. awlƒÅd al-makk) and the son of a daughter of the makk was an arbƒÅb (pl. arƒÅbƒ´b). The arƒÅbƒ´b were usually prominent councilors of the makk and the arƒÅbƒ´b al- thamƒÅniyya (eight arƒÅbƒ´b) were a special council that met in the palace. An arbƒÅb could sometimes pass his rank on to his sons. Likewise, the title of wad was sometimes bestowed on trusted slaves or servants. All awlƒÅd were eligible to be elected Makk. A wad who was given a territory from which to draw revenue was an ahl al-·π≠ƒÅqƒ´yah, one who wore the ·π≠ƒÅqƒ´yah, a headdress associated with rule. A woman who bore a son to the Makk was known as an artiyya (pl. artiyyƒÅt), a term not of Arabic origin. They attained the highest rank among the women of the royal household, each supervising her own household of surriyyat (concubines) and khaddama (maidservants).

Thomas Scot (or Scott; died 17 October 1660) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1645 and 1660. He was executed as one of the regicides of King Charles I.  Early life  Scot was educated at Westminster School and is said have attended Cambridge University. In 1626 he married Alice Allinson of Chesterford in Essex. He was a lawyer in Buckinghamshire and grew to prominence as the treasurer of the region's County Committee between 1644 and 1646. He became influential enough to dominate the Committee and was elected Member of Parliament for Aylesbury in 1645 as a recruiter to the Long Parliament. Though he had a penchant for long, passionate speeches in Parliament, Scot could also be a subtle backroom politician and had a knack for creating alliances and rallying votes. A royalist acerbically described him as one who \\"crept into the House of Commons, whispers Treason into many of the Members ears, animating the War, and ripping up and studying aggravations thereunto.\\"  Political career  Scot's beliefs about government by consent prior to Pride's Purge are hard to gauge, though from what has survived of his writings and speeches many historians have described him as being republican. His actions during the Purge period definitely indicate that he developed strong republican leanings before 1648. From the beginning of the English Civil War, Scot was a strong supporter of tough terms with King Charles I and later became a vociferous opponent of the Treaty of Newport, declaring \\"that there could be no time seasonable for such a treaty, or for a peace with so perfidious and implacable a prince; but it would always be too soon, or too late. He that draws his sword upon the king, must throw his scabbard into the fire; and that all peace with him would prove the spoil of the godly.\\" After Pride's Purge, Scot became one of the chief organizers of the trial and execution of the King. Scot was instrumental in the erection of the Republic and along with Henry Vane, Oliver Cromwell and Arthur Heselrige became one of its primary leaders.  Trial and execution  In 1653, with the fall of the Republic, Scot became one of the Protectorate's most vocal opponents, organising anti-Cromwell opposition inside the Parliament. In 1654 he was elected MP for Wycombe in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Aylesbury again in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament In 1659, he was elected MP for Wycombe again in the Third Protectorate Parliament and then sat for Aylesbury again in the restored Rump Parliament. Like all of the other 59 men who signed the death warrant for Charles I he was in grave danger when Charles II of England was restored to the throne. He fled to Flanders, but surrendered at Brussels. He was put on trial, found guilty and hanged, drawn and quartered on 17 October 1660 for the crime of regicide. Thomas Scot was brought to trial on 12 October 1660 (in the opinion of Edmund Ludlow the outcome was a foregone conclusion). He was charged with sitting in the High Court of Justice at the trial of King Charles I and with signing one warrant for summoning that court, and another for the execution. He was further accused of wanting \\"Here lies Thomas Scot, who adjudged the late King to die\\" on his gravestone. Many witnesses were produced to prove these things; and among them William Lenthal, Speaker in the Long Parliament, who, when the King entered the House of Commons in 1641, and had demanded of him the Five Members, had answered \\"that he had neither ears to hear, eyes to see, or mouth to speak except what the House gave\\", now appear for the prosecution; affirming in Court, that Scot, had justified proceeding against the Charles in the House of Commons. In his defence, Scot said that whatever had been spoken in the House ought not to be given in evidence against him, not falling under the cognisance of any inferior court, as all men knew: that for what he had done in relation to the King, he had the authority of the Long Parliament for his justification and that this Court had no right to declare whether that authority were a Parliament or not; and being demanded to produce one instance to show that the House of Commons was ever possessed of such an authority, he assured them he could produce many. But having begun with the Saxon times, he was interrupted by the Court, and told that the things of those ages were obscure. Scot then moved on to a second defence that: He was interrupted by the Court in mid sentence; and John Finch said (according to Ludlow with passion): Scot replied: To which Francis Annesley answered, that: These, with many other things of equal force were presented by Scot in his defence, not so much in the expectation that the jury would find him innocent, but to justify his actions to the country and posterity. As all expected the jury was directed to find him guilty. At his execution some of his last words were \\"I say again; to the Praise of the Free Grace of God; I bless His name He hath engaged me in a Cause, not to be Repented of, I say, Not to be Repented of\\".

Hydropower From the 15th century, the Wupper and its numerous streams gave birth to hundreds of workshops, mills and factories on their banks. Originally water was used for dying, bleaching and washing canvas and cloth, later it was used to power machines or transport waste. The Wupper thus facilitated the early industrial expansion of Wuppertal (German for \\"Wupper Valley\\") during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century.

He started his career as a teacher of Afrikaans, German and History at the Randgate Afrikaansmediumskool and obtained his PhD from Witwatersrand University. Mulder had four children. Two of his children, Pieter and Corn√© Mulder, followed their father into politics. As of the 2009 general election, both sons serve in the National Assembly of South Africa as Members of Parliament for the Freedom Front Plus.  Political career=Mayor In 1951 he was appointed member of the city council of Randfontein and immediately elected deputy mayor and chairman of the finance committee of the city council. In 1953 (at age 28) he was elected mayor of Randfontein and two years later in 1955 was elected President of the Transvaal Municipal Association. In 1957 he was elected mayor again and he was a member of the United Municipal Executive of South Africa for four years. Parliament Mulder was elected to the legislature in 1958 as a National Party member. John Vorster named him Information Minister in 1968. In 1977, he was implicated as namesake of the Muldergate Scandal, in which he was accused of having established a government slush fund for financing The Citizen to bolster support for Vorster's regime among English-speaking South Africans. In January 1978, he was appointed Minister of Plural Relations and Development. Though the scandal eventually brought about Vorster's downfall and complete retirement from politics, Mulder lost the ballot to succeed him in September 1978. He barely lost in the first round to Pieter Willem Botha in a narrow 72-78 vote. In the second round, he lost with a comfortable 98 votes to 74, in Botha's favour. This was because 20 supporters of foreign minister Pik Botha (the third candidate in the race) threw their support to P.W. Botha, and only two to Mulder. Mulder was subsequently retained in Botha's reshuffling of the government. However, the Information Scandal stories started appearing in the media, which led to his resignation as Minister on 8 November 1978. Following his expulsion from the National Party in the wake of the Information Scandal, Mulder and his followers formed the National Conservative Party. However, all of the party's nine candidates were defeated at the 1981 general election. Mulder himself lost by 922 votes in the constituency of Randfontein, where he had won in the 1977 election with a majority of 7,763. After the founding of the Conservative Party, in which he participated, Mulder was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1987 general election, at the age of 62. By then suffering from terminal cancer, he died on 12 January 1988 before he was able to take his seat. His two sons, Pieter and Corn√©, became Conservative Party MPs in 1988 and currently serve in Parliament as members of Freedom Front Plus.

The main hall can accommodate over 5,000 male worshippers, with women praying on a balcony overlooking the hall. The mosque holds a chandelier and a vast carpet, with very little furniture. The inside of the dome is decorated with sacred geometry in the Islamic tradition and has small stained glass windows around its base, containing turquoise coloured 16-pointed stars. There is also a small bookshop and halal caf√© on the premises. The mosque is joined to the Islamic Cultural Centre (ICC) which was officially opened by King George VI in 1944. The land was donated by George VI to the Muslim community of Britain in return for the donation of land in Cairo by King Farouk of Egypt and Sudan on which to build an Anglican cathedral.

The intent was to enable Muslims in Britain to build a mosque and an Islamic Cultural Centre, so they could conduct affairs pertaining to their faith. 1944 A Mosque Committee comprising various prominent Muslim diplomats and Muslim residents in the United Kingdom accepted the gift and The Islamic Cultural Centre which includes the London Central Mosque, was established and officially opened in November by His Majesty King George VI. 1947 The Mosque Committee registered the London Central Mosque Trust Limited as a Trust Corporation in September. At the time, seven representatives from six Muslim countries acted as Trustees. 1954 - 1967 Several designs were considered for the mosque. There were long protracted planning applications to various authorities but the necessary planning approval was not granted. 1969 An Open International Competition was held for the design of the building. Over one hundred designs were submitted, from both Muslim and non-Muslim applicants. The design finally selected was by the English architect Frederick Gibberd.

Attempts to demonstrate the existence of a \\"brown note\\" using sound waves transmitted through air have failed. The name is a metonym for the common color of human feces. Frequencies supposedly involved are between 5 and 9 Hz, which is below the lower frequency limit of human hearing. High power sound waves below 20 Hz are felt in the body, not heard by the ear as sound. Physiological effects of low frequency vibration Air is a very inefficient medium for transferring low frequency vibration from a transducer to the human body.Tempest, W. Infrasound and low frequency vibration (1977). Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd Mechanical connection of the vibration source to the human body, however, provides a potentially dangerous combination. The U.S. space program, worried about the harmful effects of rocket flight on astronauts, ordered vibration tests that used cockpit seats mounted on vibration tables to transfer \\"brown note\\" and other frequencies directly to the human subjects. Very high power levels of 160 dB were achieved at frequencies of 2‚Äì3 Hz. Test frequencies ranged from 0.5 Hz to 40 Hz. Test subjects suffered motor ataxia, nausea, visual disturbance, degraded task performance and difficulties in communication. These tests are assumed by researchers to be the nucleus of the current urban myth.ProSoundWeb: some effects of low end (bulletin board entry by Tom Danley)The Matterhorn In February 2005 the television show MythBusters used twelve Meyer Sound 700-HP subwoofers‚Äîa model and quantity that has been employed for major rock concerts. Normal operating frequency range of the selected subwoofer model was 28 Hz to 150 Hz but the 12 enclosures at MythBusters had been specially modified for deeper bass extension. Roger Schwenke and John Meyer directed the Meyer Sound team in devising a special test rig that would produce very high sound levels at infrasonic frequencies. The subwoofers' tuning ports were blocked and their input cards were altered. The modified cabinets were positioned in an open ring configuration: four stacks of three subwoofers each. Test signals were generated by a SIM 3 audio analyzer, with its software modified to produce infrasonic tones. A Br√ºel & Kj√¶r sound level analyzer, fed with an attenuated signal from a model 4189 measurement microphone, displayed and recorded sound pressure levels. The hosts on the show tried a series of frequencies as low as 5 Hz, attaining a level of 120 decibels of sound pressure at 9 Hz and up to 153 dB at frequencies above 20 Hz, but the rumored physiological effects did not materialize. The test subjects all reported some physical anxiety and shortness of breath, even a small amount of nausea, but this was dismissed by the hosts, noting that sound at that frequency and intensity moves air rapidly in and out of one's lungs.

They break their fast at the time of the call to prayer for the evening prayer. This is their second meal of the day; the daily fast during Ramadan begins immediately after the pre-dawn meal of and continues during the daylight hours, ending with sunset with the evening meal of iftar.  Description  Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan, and is often done as a community, with Muslim people gathering to break their fast together. The meal is taken just after the call to the prayer, which is around sunset. Traditionally three dates are eaten to break the fast, in emulation of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, who broke his fast in this manner, but this is not mandatory. Many Muslims believe that feeding someone iftar as a form of charity is very rewarding and that such was practised by Muhammad. According to a publication of South Africa:  Around the world = Afghanistan  In Afghanistan, iftar usually includes the traditional dates, shorwa (soup), kebabs, du piyaza (meat stewed in an onion-based sauce), manto (seasoned, minced meat wrapped in pasta), kabuli palaw (rice with lentils, raisins, carrots, and lamb), shorm beray, bolani (fried or baked flat bread with a vegetable filling), and rice, as well as other dishes. Afghans also have an extensive range of sweet dishes and desserts.  Bangladesh  Common iftar items of Bangladesh Iftar food items in Chowk Bazaar of Dhaka In Bangladesh, a wide variety of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib time. Some of the common iftar items from Bangladeshi cuisine include Piyaju (made of lentil paste, chopped onions and green chillies, like falafel), beguni (made of thin slices of eggplant dipped in a thin batter of gram flour), jilapi, chana-muri, haleem, dates, samosas, dal puri (a type of lentil-based savoury pastry), chola (cooked chickpeas), kebab, mughlai porota (stuffed porota with minced meat and spices), pitha, traditional Bengali sweets and different types of fruits such as watermelon. Bengalis open their fast with all their friends and family and eat together in a banquet with their array of food however savoury items are eaten before sweet. Drinks such as lemon shorbot and yoghurt shorbot (made of yoghurt, water, sugar and rooh afza) as well as borhani are common on iftar tables across the country. People like to have iftar at home with all family members, and iftar parties are also arranged by mosques. People often distribute iftar in mosques for the people praying to eat, believing it is a good deed. After Iftar people pray maghrib and later Isha then many head straight for Taraweeh prayers where 20 rakats are performed to finish one Juz' of the Quran.  Brunei  In Brunei Darussalam, iftar is locally referred to as sungkai. Traditionally this is held at a regional or village mosque for those who have or will be performing the evening prayers. At the mosque, a mosque buffet is prepared by the local residents at which all are welcomed to break their fast together. Before the iftar, the beduk (a type of drum) must be heard as a signal to begin the sungkai. In the capital Bandar Seri Begawan, the firing of several cannons at the central business district also marks the sungkai. The sungkai is generally a welcomed time of the day, so Bruneians occasionally break their fast at restaurants along with their extended family. Additionally, only during the month of Ramadan, each district, with the exception of the Brunei and Muara district, hosts an expansive network of tamu or Ramadan stalls where freshly cooked local delicacies are sold more than other times of the year.  India  Different types of food items on Ifter plate In India, almost every Muslim stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and adhan. Muslims break their fasts with family and friends, with most Mosques also arranging free 'iftar'. Preparations for iftar commence hours before, in homes and at roadside stalls. Iftar begins by eating dates or drinking water, but this is only the opening of a rich meal. The spread of 'iftar' can be grand, with both vegetarian to non-vegetarian dishes and a variety of juices and sherbets. Iftar usually is a heavy meal and is followed by a second, lighter dinner eaten before the night (isha) prayers and the taraweeh prayers. In Hyderabad and nearby areas, people often break their fast with Haleem because it has a rich taste and is quite filling. In other southern states (Tamil Nadu and Kerala), Muslims break their fast with nonbu kanji, a rich, filling rice dish of porridge consistency, cooked for hours with meat and vegetables. This is often served with bonda, bajji, and vadai. Vegetarians break their fast with a dish called surkumba, which is prepared from milk, and this is particularly popular in certain parts of Karnataka. In northern states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, the fast is typically ended with fresh dates, cut fresh fruits (sometimes served as chaat) and fruit juice along with fried dishes like samosas, pakodas etc.  Indonesia  Jackfruit kolak, one of various iftar desserts in Indonesia In Indonesia iftar is called \\"buka puasa\\", which means \\"to open the fast\\". Markets sell various foods for iftar, including the date, which is popular, as well as unique Indonesian sweet food and drink such as kolak, es kelapa muda, es buah, es campur, cendol or dawet, etc. Most of them are only found easily in Ramadan. Iftar is usually begun by eating these sweets, as inspired by the Prophet's Sunnah of eating dates. Maghrib time is traditionally marked by the Bedug, a traditional big Indonesian drum. After Asr prayers, traditional markets will begin to open. The food stalls generally sell many kinds of items that are specifically for \\"iftar\\". Traffic jams often occur leading up to Maghrib time. Sometimes people invite groups of orphans to eat with them. After Iftar and maghrib prayer which is usually done at the homes, people go to the mosque for Isha'a and Tarawih prayer, which in Indonesia, is often accompanied by a short sermon known as \\"ceramah\\" before the Tarawih prayer commence.  Iran  An example of Iranian Iftar table. Dinner will be served later. An example of Iranian public Iftar In Iran, neighbourhood iftar feasts are not customary; the (larger and more festive) meal is usually shared among family. A small selection of foods is prepared to break the fast and is summarily followed by a proper Persian meal. Most common iftar items are: Chai (tea) with zulbia and bamiyeh and other sweets, dates, halva, Fereni, Ash Reshteh, Halim, Shami Lapeh, Noon (bread usually lavash or barbari) and paneer with greens and fresh herbs. One of the biggest iftar meals in the world takes place in Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad city every year, with some 12 thousand people attending every night.  Malaysia  Bandung drink, the most common drinks during Iftar in Malaysia In Malaysia, iftar is known as \\"berbuka puasa\\", which literally means \\"to open the fast\\". As usual, the Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. Various foodstuffs from the Malaysian cuisine tend to be readily available from Bazaar Ramadhans, which are street food markets that are open during Ramadan; local favourites include bandung drink, sugarcane juice, soybean milk mixed with grass jelly, nasi lemak, laksa, ayam percik, chicken rice, satay and popiah among others. Many high-end restaurants and hotels also provide special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with families and friends. Furthermore, most mosques also provide free bubur lambok (a special type of rice congee) after Asar prayers. Most Muslims will usually have a special supper after performing their tarawih prayers called moreh (pronounced ). The light meal, taking place in mosque and prayer hall grounds, consists of local traditional snacks and hot tea. In shopping malls and public venues in Malaysia, the time of iftar is indicated by radios announcing the call to Maghrib prayers.  Maldives  In the Maldives, iftar is known as roadha villun, which means \\"break fast\\". As usual, most Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. There are many exclusive restaurants and hotels providing special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with the families and friends. All the mosques in the Maldives provide free dates and juice to break fast. At local homes you will find various cold fruit juices (water melon, mango, passion fruit, pineapple) sweet (boakiba, pudding) and salty shorteats called hedhika (boakiba, bajiya, gulha, masroshi, cutlets), the latter made with mainly fish, curries, roshi and salads made with local greens, chilli, onion and lemon.  Nigeria  Nigeria hosts what is by some way the largest Muslim community in West Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Iftar (known in the Yoruba language as isinu) holds the same importance in Nigeria's Sunni population as the rest of the Islamic world. Foods include Jollof rice, suya, ·ªçb·∫πÃÄ ·∫πg√∫s√≠, ewur·∫π, √†k√†r√†, dabinu/dabino, ·ªçÃÄp·ªçÃÄt·ªçÃÅ, etc.  Pakistan  Samosas are a common Iftari snack in Pakistan. In Pakistan, almost everybody stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and adhan (call to prayer). Preparations for iftar commence about three hours beforehand, in homes and at roadside stalls. The fast can be ended by eating dates, or simply by drinking water, if dates are not available. Many restaurants offer iftar deals, especially in the big cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. Iftar as a meal in Pakistan is usually heavy, consisting mainly of sweet and savoury treats such as jalebi (pretzel-shaped, deep-fried batter, soaked in sugar syrup), samosas (minced meat and/or vegetables, wrapped in dough and deep-fried or baked), pakora (sliced vegetables, dipped in batter and deep-fried) with ketchup or chatni, and namak para (seasoned cracker), besides the staple dates and water. Other items such as chicken rolls, spring rolls, Shami Kebabs, fruit salads, papad (sheets of batter that are then sun-dried, deep-fried or roasted until they have the texture of potato chips or crisps), chana chaat (chickpea salad), and dahi balay (or \\"dahi baray\\"‚Äîfried lentil dumplings served with yoghurt) are also very common. Amongst the Punjabi, Sindhi and Mohajir households, iftar is often followed up by a regular dinner later during the night. Those in the north and west, including Pashtuns, Balochis, and Tajiks, on the other hand combine dinner and iftar. Laghman soup (noodle soup), locally called Kalli, is an iftar staple in Chitral and parts of Gilgit. After iftar, Muslims rush to the mosques to offer Tarawih (an 8 or 20 rakat Muslim prayer during the month of Ramadan). Various television channels also stop their normal telecast and broadcast special Ramadan transmissions, especially at the time of Sehar and Iftar. The whole month of Ramadan is marked in Pakistan as a festive season when people make donations to the poor and give charity. Some organizations and companies also offer free iftar meals to the common people.  Russia and Ukraine  In Russia and Ukraine, Ramadan is observed mostly in Muslim- majority states: (Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, Crimea, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan). In Moscow and Kiev, it has become a tradition to open Ramadan Tent, a public iftar event organised by Russia's Mufti Council and Ukraine's Religious Administration of Muslims. In Dagestan, Muslims gather in Makhachkala Central Juma Mosque to break their fast and pray taraweeh prayers. Dates and fruits are preferred to break the fast, followed by soup, bread, and different local delicacies such as be≈übarmaq, kurze and others. It is widely believed that Russian and Ukrainian traditional drink kvass is very good to quell the thirst.  Singapore  In Singapore, iftar is called \\"buka puasa\\". It is usually accompanied with dates and sweet drinks such as Bandung, Chendol and Air Sirap. Singaporean Muslims usually eat an array of dishes ranging from rice and noodles. Many buy food from bazaars that can be found in different parts of the city state such as in Bugis, Kampong Glam, Geylang Serai and even in populated towns such as Tampines, Jurong East, Jurong West, Clementi and West Coast.  Sri Lanka  Muslims in Sri Lanka make special snacks /appetisers at Muslim homes, such as samosas, cutlets, rolls, kanjee, falooda and many more dishes. They eat iftar with the family if possible. Muslims believe that giving to the poor is very rewarding. They eat a date and drink some water to break the fast or to perform iftar. Then they have the prepared meal. Some people like to prepare foods and give to the people performing iftar in the mosques.  Taiwan  Iftar at Taipei Grand Mosque, Taiwan Islam is a growing minority religion in Taiwan. During Ramadan, major mosques around Taiwan are filled with Muslims going to have their iftar followed by Tarawih prayer. Muslims in Taiwan usually break their fast with dates and water.  Trinidad and Tobago  In Trinidad and Tobago Muslims represent about 6% of the population.Islam in Trinidad and Tobago Iftar is traditionally performed in the social setting of the Masjid. Various food items showing the mixed ethnic nature of the country are usually available. Fare may include fried rice; roti; curried chicken, goat, and duck; curried channa; and alloo (potato). Depending on the persons presenting the meal, it may even include such non-traditional items as macaroni pie. The meal is usually served with persons sitting at tables with the components of the meal brought to the tables.  Turkey  bower of Topkapi Palace where the Ottoman sultan-caliphs would break the fast Sultan Ahmed Mosque with the kandils lit. The lights in this example spell out holiday greetings. In Turkey and Northern Cyprus, the month of Ramadan is celebrated with great joy, and iftar dinners play a big part in this. In larger cities like Istanbul all of the restaurants offer special deals and set menus for iftar. Most of the set menus start with a soup or an appetiser platter called iftariye. It consists of dates, olives, cheese, pastƒ±rma, sujuk, Ramazan pidesi (a special bread only baked during Ramadan), and various pastries called b√∂rek. The main course consists of various Turkish foods, especially the Ottoman Palace Traditional Foods. A dessert called g√ºlla√ß is served in most places. Most of the fine-dining restaurants offer live musical performances of Ottoman classical music, Turkish music and Sufi music. Most of the Ramadan celebration practices in Turkey have their roots in the traditions of the former Ottoman Empire. At the minarets of mosques, lights called kandil are switched on from sunset to dawn. As soon as the sun sets, a traditional \\"Ramadan Cannon\\" is fired from the highest hill in every city as a signal to start eating the iftar. In Istanbul, one of the more notable places to celebrate the iftar dinner is the Sultanahmet Square. Located near the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque) the Sultanahmet Square hosts many activities, including mini restaurants opened during the month of Ramadan, special shows, and traditional Ottoman theatrical shows. At Topkapi Palace the Ottoman sultan-caliphs would break their fast under the gilded bower. The Tarawih prayer is mostly practised in Turkish mosques as 20 rekahs, broken into 5 groups of 4 rekahs. Between each set of 4 rekahs, a hymn composed by the Turkish musician Buhurizade Itri is sung by all people attending the prayer. The hymn is a prayer to praise the Islamic prophet Muhammad. As Ramadan is also the month of almsgiving, many people organise iftar dinners for the poor, students, guests, and foreigners. People can find Turkish food available in most mosques. During Ramadan, Turkish NGOs like the Journalists and Writers Foundation have recently started to organise Interfaith Dialogue Dinners to promote dialogue between those of different religious and cultural backgrounds. These high-profile events have started a whole new era of organising large dinner parties by the NGOs in Turkey for people from different cultures and understandings even if they are not Muslims. In recent years Turkish NGOs, such as the Peace Islands Institute (former Interfaith Dialog Center), all over the world have organised iftar dinners for inter- cultural and interfaith dialogue, which helps promote the true understanding of the month of Ramadan.  United States and Canada  1 September 2010. During Middle East peace negotiations, then President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu look at their wristwatches to see if it is officially sunset. Iftar meals in the United States and Canada are often held at mosques, households, and Islamic community centres. On 9 December 1805, President Thomas Jefferson postponed dinner at the White House until sunset to accommodate an envoy from Tunis, an event considered by many to be the first White House iftar. The first official iftar was held at the White House in 1996, hosted by First Lady Hillary Clinton, and iftar meals were subsequently held annually at the White House and hosted by the U.S. President and the First Lady until 2016. President Donald Trump did not host an iftar dinner at the White House in 2017, his first year in office, but resumed the tradition on June 6, 2018, hosting friends and diplomatic staff from many Muslim-majority nations. From 1996, the United States Department of State held an annual iftar dinner for local and national community leaders and faith groups as well as foreign policy officials.Remarks at the Annual State Department Iftaar Dinner Hillary Clinton: \\"Actually, we started in 1996 and held the first Ramadan Eid celebration at the White House.\\" This practice ceased in 2017, when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to host an iftar. The Pentagon continues its tradition of holding an iftar for Muslim members of the U.S. armed forces and special guests from other nations; the first such iftar under the Trump administration was held on 15 June 2017. The occasion has also been marked in Jewish synagogues. In 2012, Iftar was recognized with events at three synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper extended an invitation to Muslim leaders to break the Ramadan fast with him at the Prime Minister's residence in 2015. This was the first time the Prime Minister's office had hosted an iftar.

K2 was first released in Korea published by Daiwon C.I. with the first volume on December 22, 2000, and later formed a total of five individual volumes by May 29, 2002. The manhwa volumes were distributed in English by Tokyopop between February 2004 and February 2005. Tokyopop radically redesigned the covers of the volumes from how they appeared in the Korean version. Kill Me, Kiss Me is published by Egmont Manga & Anime in Germany. Plot Kill Me, Kiss Me is a story with two separate but loosely connected plots. The first, spanning only the first volume of the manhwa, centers around the high school girl Tae Yeon Im and her obsession over a handsome model named Kun Kang. Tae finds out that Kun goes to the same school as her cousin Jung-Woo Im, to whom she is almost identical in appearance. She makes a deal with Jung-Woo to trade places so she can get closer to the model of her dreams, though they settle on only one week for the switch. However, upon arriving at Pure Water High, she promptly gets beaten up by the gang member Ga-Woon Kim, apparently Kun Kang's closest friend. Despite this minor setback, Tae does not give up and goes back to the school the next day to continue her attempt to get closer with Kun. Most of the rest of the plot from this first story arc involves Ga-Woon starting to develop feelings of attraction towards Tae, though still under the belief that Tae is really Jung-Woo, Ga-Woon starts to question his sexuality. The second arc in the Kill Me, Kiss Me series spans the rest of the manhwa from volumes two through five, and has almost no connection with the first arc. The story now concentrates on the beautiful girl Que-Min Ghun, who although appearing innocent at first glance is actually incredibly strong. She attends the same school as Jung-Woo and after meeting him one day in the street, starts to develop a crush on him, going as far as trying to protect him from people like Ghoon-Hahm Che and his gang, the Yi Won. Eventually, Ghoon-Hahm offers an arrangement: in exchange for not beating up Jung-Woo, Que-Min will have to go out with the gang leader himself. Ghoon-Hahm and Que-Min start their forced relationship, and Que-Min finally gets Jung-Woo to remember her name and notice her. Characters=Main characters ;Tae Yeon Im: Tae Yeon is the main heroine of the first arc of the story but otherwise appears relatively sparingly throughout the rest of the series. She tends to be a strong-willed girl who doesn't usually give up very easily, and is also not afraid to pick a fight with others stronger than her. She switches places with her male cousin Jung-Woo in order to get closer to a model she admires named Kun Kang. Although eventually she starts to learn more about Kun and his best friend Ga- Woon, whom she also starts developing feelings towards. ;Jung-Woo Im: He is the main character of the second arc of the story though serves to start the plot for the first arc. Most of the time Jung-Woo is very passive, showing no emotion unless he's engaged in a fight. Despite his frail appearance, he is relatively physically strong, which takes his opponents off guard. His most defining feature is that he looks a lot like a female, especially later on when he grows his hair out. He has an intense affinity towards dogs as when he was young he found a stray he later named Ghost though it died after it got run over by a car. ;Kun Kang: A male model who attends Pure Water High School who is usually either gone from school in a photo shoot, found sleeping in class, or otherwise hanging around his best friend Ga-Woon Kim who he has known since junior high school. Other than in the first arc, he almost never appears again. ;Ga-Woon Kim: He is the leader of his small gang though has still gained a reputation as being a strong deviant character. After Tae and Jung-Woo switch places, he eventually finds himself starting to feel attracted to Tae, though while still thinking her as Jung-Woo, he also starts to question his sexuality. ;Lin Lee: She is a short, conceited girl who uses a lot of different tactics to make herself more appealing to the eye, like wearing hair extensions, skin concealer, and plucking her eyebrows, among other things. She has developed a crush on Ghoon-Hahm, but he doesn't want anything to do with her and also barely even knows she exists. She is also the younger sister of Jin Lee, but the two weren't that close, even in their childhood. ;Kai: He is the leader of the Ghoo Won gang who knew Ghoon-Hahm back from junior high school, when he was known as Bok-Chil. After a run in they had together during a fight with about twenty other guys against Ghoon- Hahm, he fled to Japan only to come back later. Pretty-boy Fan Club members The \\"Pretty-boy Fan Club\\" is a club of a group of female students at Pure Water High School, where Jung-Woo also attends, who take pictures of all of the boys in their school who they view as especially attractive. ;Que- Min Ghun: One of the main characters of the second arc, she is a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl who has a past that she has tried very hard to forget. At her old school, she was known as a female thug due to how physically strong she is and this had somewhat of a bad reputation. However, after moving and attending a new school, she was determined not to show anyone new she met her other more stronger side and wanted to be viewed as a normal high school girl. One of her interests is writing and she has even taken it upon herself to start writing her first novel which she publishes online. ;Yang Me: She is a very hyper girl who usually wears her hair in two pig tails. Yang Me also seems to be the most enthusiastic about being in the club and is more or less the unofficial leader of the group. She also appeared in the first arc since she is in Jung-Woo's class and appears to be friends with him. ;Yeon Wha: She is also very enthusiastic about obsessing over all the pretty boys in her high school. She has been observed to have a mild temper when around Lin Lee, who most of the girls in the club detest due to her always stealing all the boys away from them. ;Min Ju: One of the members of the club, though not much is known about her as she appears so sparingly and only has a few lines in the whole series. Other than that, she seems like a typical boy-crazy girl. Yi Won gang members ;Ghoon-Hahm Che: Only a first year in high school, he is the leader of the Yi Won gang and has a reputation to be a very tough individual. While in junior high school, he got into several fights where he was outnumbered, but ended up winning them anyway. He and Que-Min first met while still in elementary school and is also where Ghoon-Hahm developed his first crush on Que-Min. ;Won Hee: A third year student, he tends to be one of the most charismatic members of the gang and also the one that talks the most other than Ghoon-Hahm. He seems to be a very friendly person most of the time. ;Ju Yoo: A first year in high school, he has been described as being love struck most of the time but is otherwise a good guy. In the summer, he is nicknamed \\"Red Sleeveless\\" due to the red sleeveless shirt he wears during that time and in contrast he's nicknamed \\"Black turtleneck\\" in the winter for similar reasons. ;Dar Jay: A second year in high school, most of the time he's all talk and is not really that strong. He loves to sing karaoke but is not very good at it. ;Yeong Joon: A first year in high school, he is one of the homosexual members of the gang who is currently in an intimate relationship with Jin Lee. Yeong usually doesn't say much and seems to be pretty aloof most of the time. ;Jin Lee: He is a third year in high school who is the only other homosexual member of the gang. Most of the time he's tending to Yeong Joon in a playful manner, as in feeding him food. On top of that, he also looks very much like a girl. Jin's father is the boss of the Sang-Lee gang, a hardcore mob and so Jin is also the source of money for the Yi Won gang. He is also the older brother of Lin Lee, but the two weren't that close, even in their childhood.

It was designed to operate from unpaved runways and make short takeoff and landings (STOL). It features a large squared fuselage with a full- width rear cargo door/ramp. The C-23A and C-23B are variants of the Short 330 and the C-23B+ is a variant of the Short 360. Design and development The Short 330 was developed by Short Brothers of Belfast from their earlier Short SC.7 Skyvan STOL utility transport. The 330 has a longer wingspan and fuselage than the Skyvan, while retaining the Skyvan's square shaped fuselage cross section, allowing it to carry up to 30 passengers while retaining good short field characteristics. The 330 entered commercial service in 1976. In addition to the passenger aircraft, Shorts also planned two freight versions. The Short 330-UTT (for Utility Tactical Transport) was a military transport version fitted with a strengthened cabin floor and paratroop doors, which was sold in small numbers, primarily to Thailand, which purchased four. The Short Sherpa was a freighter fitted with a full-width rear cargo door/ramp. This version first flew on 23 December 1982, with the first order for 18 aircraft being placed by the United States Air Force in March 1983. These aircraft were assigned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) for the European Distribution System Aircraft (EDSA) role, flying cargo and personnel between United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) air bases. The first C-23A for U.S. Air Force during its official rollout ceremony The Sherpa's cabin is 6.5 ft (1.98 m) wide, 6.5 ft (1.98 m) high and 29 ft (8.84 m) long. It offers a cargo volume of 1,230 cu ft (34.83 m3), with a cargo capacity of 8,000 lb (3,629 kg). The Sherpa is also capable of operating from unpaved runways and making short takeoff and landings (STOL). In U.S. military service, the Short 330 was designated C-23A Sherpa. The C-23B Sherpa is similar to the C-23A, but with cabin windows. The C-23B+ Short 360 derivative was created by replacing the rear fuselage of Short 360s obtained on the second-hand market with the twin tail and rear loading ramp of the Short Sherpa. The C-23 was produced at the Short Brothers' facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland for the U.S. Department of Defense. Operational history C-23A with aft cargo door down A C-23 Sherpa in center front with a C-5 Galaxy in rear U.S. Air Force The C-23A Sherpa entered service with the United States Air Force in Europe in 1985 based at Zweibr√ºcken Air Base. It continued in use in the EDSA role until November 1990 with the post-cold war force reductions. All the Sherpas returned to the United States; three aircraft were transferred to the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB, eight aircraft went to the U.S. Army and the remaining seven to the U.S. Forest Service. The Test Pilot School's aircraft were retired in 1997. U.S. Army The eight former USAF aircraft were used for test duties at different units; two were re-designated as JC-23A. The Army purchased four civil Short 330 aircraft to replace the DHC C-7 Caribou being used to support the Kwajalein Missile Range. These were not given a C-23 designation, and were retired in 1992. In 1988, the Army ordered ten new-build Short 330s designated C-23B to replace the DHC C-7 Caribou used by the U.S. Army National Guard Aviation and Repair Activity Depots. In 1990, a further six were ordered. When the Army wanted 20 more C-23s in 1990 the production line had closed; second-hand Short 360 aircraft were purchased instead. Designated the C-23B+, these were modified from the original single tail to the twin-tail and cargo ramp of the other C-23Bs. In 1994, another eight aircraft were converted to replace the DHC UV-18 Twin Otters used in Alaska. During Iraq War (2003‚Äì2011), the C-23 served the Army's intra-theater needs of cargo and personnel transport. It provided an economic alternative for transporting some 20 people or three pallets of cargo when speed was not critical.\\"C-23: A Small Cargo Plane that Makes a Big Difference\\" , Military.com, 9 February 2004. As part of the U.S. Army's Constant Hawk intelligence gathering program, five Short 360s were modified for use in Iraq and flew in theater between 2006 and 2011. A further two modified aircraft collided in mid-air before delivery to Iraq. The Constant Hawk aircraft were not given a military designation. On 13 June 2007, the Alenia C-27J was selected to replace the C-23 in U.S. Army service. A total of 43 C-23s were in service with the U.S. Army as of November 2008 (all US C-27 aircraft were transferred to the US Coast Guard in 2012 due to budget shortfalls).\\"Directory: World Air Forces\\", Flight International, 11‚Äì17 November 2008.

Several surplus aircraft were sold to United States operators, who used them to transport equipment and crews to remote work sites. Others were used by Army National Guard units in the various states. On 3 March 2001, a C-23B Sherpa belonging to the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard was carrying 18 construction workers of the Virginia Air National Guard from Hurlburt Field, Florida to Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. The pilot left the flight deck to use the aft bathroom. His weight in the tailcone shifted the center of gravity sufficiently that the airplane became unstable when a patch of severe turbulence was encountered. The violent g-force shifts then encountered rendered the crew unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight near Unadilla, Georgia, killing the 21 persons on board. Later calculations determined that the aircraft had been loaded outside its operating envelope at the start of the flight. Variants ;C-23A Sherpa: Twin-engine transport aircraft for the U.S. Air Force based on the Short 330-UTT; it was fitted with a strengthened cabin floor with a roller conveyor system, plus a forward cargo door on the port side of the fuselage, equipped with a hydraulically operated full-width rear cargo door/ramp; 18 built. ;C-23B Sherpa: Twin-engine transport aircraft for the US Army National Guard, similar to the C-23A, but with cabin windows, stronger landing-gear, inward-opening paratroop doors at the rear of the fuselage and an air-operable two-section cargo ramp; 16 built. ;C-23B+ Super Sherpa: Short 360 aircraft purchased as used aircraft by the U.S. Army and modified by the West Virginia Air Center (WVAC) for the replacement of the rear fuselage of the Short 360, with its single tall fin, with the twin tail and rear loading ramp of the Short Sherpa. 28 civil aircraft were modified. ;C-23C :Both C-23B and C-23B+ with flightdeck avionic upgrade under the \\"Avionics System Cockpit Upgrade\\" program, 43 modified. ;C-23D :C-23C with upgraded avionics under the \\"Safety Avionics Modification\\" program from 2010, program was cancelled and only four aircraft were modified.

Description  Depending on the reaction being measured, the device can take a variety of forms. In general, it is similar to a graduated cylinder, and is most commonly found in two sizes: 50 mL and 100 mL. It is closed at the top end with the bottom end immersed in water or mercury. The liquid traps a sample of gas in the cylinder, and the graduation allows the volume of the gas to be measured. For some reactions, two platinum wires (chosen for their non-reactivity) are placed in the sealed end so an electric spark can be created between them. The electric spark can initiate a reaction in the gas mixture and the graduation on the cylinder can be read to determine the change in volume resulting from the reaction. The use of the device is quite similar to the original barometer, except that the gas inside displaces some of the liquid that is used.

IMSS. 14 Jan 2008. began experimenting with different \\"airs\\" using his own redesigned pneumatic trough in which mercury instead of water would trap gases that were usually soluble in water. From these experiments Priestley is credited with discovering many new gases such as oxygen, hydrogen chloride, and ammonia. He also discovered a way to find the purity or \\"goodness\\" of air using \\"nitrous air test\\". The eudiometer functions on the greater solubility of NO2 over NO, and the reaction :2 NO + O2 ‚Üí 2 NO2. A quantity of air is combined with NO over water, and the more soluble compound dissolves, leaving the remaining air somewhat contracted in volume. The richer the air was in oxygen, the greater the contraction.Geerdt Magiels (2009) From Sunlight to Insight. Jan IngenHousz, the discovery of photosynthesis & science in the light of ecology, Chapter 5: A crucial instrument: the rise and fall of the eudiometer, pages=199-231, VUB Press It is from these experiments that Marsilio Landriani became inspired to create a more useful tool in measuring the \\"healthiness\\" of air. In 1775, Landriani invented the first eudiometer\\"Eudiometer\\". IMSS. 14 Jan 2079. and used it to conduct his own experiments. From these experiments Landriani theorized about the temperament of certain gases and the atmosphere and later published a paper called Ricerche fisiche intorno alla salubrit√† dell'aria (Physical researches on the salubrity of air). Though many of his findings were incorrect, his invention was the precursor of the modern day eudiometer. The eudiometer with the nitrous air test was the way Jan Ingenhousz verified that the bubbles given off under water by plant leaves exposed to sunlight were oxygen bubbles. His description of photosynthesis was published in 1779, and in 1785 he wrote about eudiometers in Journal de Physique (v 26, p 339). According to a biographer, Ingenhousz indicated that \\"many instruments were called eudiometers although strictly speaking they didn't deserve the name ... misunderstandings could exist when not everybody was using the same instruments.\\" An electrified version of the eudiometer was developed by Count Alessandro Volta (1745‚Äì1827), an Italian physicist who is well known for his contributions to the electric battery and electricity. Aside from its laboratory function, the eudiometer is also known for its part in the \\"Volta pistol\\".\\"Apparatus for Natural Philosophy Volta's Pistol\\". Thomas B. Greensdale Jr.. 17 Jan 2008 Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the \\"goodness\\" of air, analyzing the flammability of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp gases in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's electrophorus. If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the volt, to be named after him. In 1785 Henry Cavendish used a eudiometer to determine the fraction of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.  Etymology  The name \\"eudiometer\\" comes from the Greek meaning clear or mild, which is the combination of the prefix meaning \\"good\\", and meaning \\"heavenly\\" or \\"of Zeus\\" (the god of the sky and atmosphere),\\"Eudiometer.\\" HighBeam Encyclopedia. 3 Dec. 2107 . with the suffix -meter meaning \\"measure\\".\\"Eudiometer.\\" New World Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1979. Because the eudiometer was originally used to measure the amount of oxygen in the air, which was thought to be greater in \\"nice\\" weather,\\"Eudiometer.\\" New Oxford American Dictionary. 2nd ed. 2006 the root appropriately describes the apparatus.  Usage  Scheme of eudiometer Applications of a eudiometer include the analysis of gases and the determination of volume differences in chemical reactions. The eudiometer is filled with water, inverted so that its open end is facing the ground (while holding the open end so that no water escapes), and then submersed in a basin of water. A chemical reaction is taking place through which gas is created. One reactant is typically at the bottom of the eudiometer (which flows downward when the eudiometer is inverted) and the other reactant is suspended on the rim of the eudiometer, typically by means of a platinum or copper wire (due to their low reactivity). When the gas created by the chemical reaction is released, it should rise into the eudiometer so that the experimenter may accurately read the volume of the gas produced at any given time. Normally a person would read the volume when the reaction is completed. This procedure is followed in many experiments, including an experiment in which one experimentally determines the Ideal gas law constant R. The eudiometer is similar in structure to the meteorological barometer. Similarly, a eudiometer uses water to release gas into the eudiometer tube, converting the gas into a visible, measurable amount. A correct measurement of the pressure when performing these experiments is crucial for the calculations involved in the PV=nRT equation, because the pressure could change the density of the gas.

As both breeds are noted for endurance and intelligence, the resulting cross is usually able to excel at endurance riding as well as other disciplines performed by either breed, including ranch work, and a variety of horse show disciplines. An AraAppaloosa with one purebred Arabian parent may be registered as a half- Arabian with the Arabian Horse Association, and because the Appaloosa breed still has an open stud book to horses of Arabian breeding, many Arappaloosas can also be registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC). However, they also have their own organization, the AraAppaloosa and Foundation Breeders' International (AAFBI). History The AAFBI was established in an effort to protect the original or \\"foundation\\" Appaloosa, and promotes the incorporation of Arabian bloodlines into \\"foundation-bred\\" Appaloosa breeding programs, preserving what they consider to be the original type of Appaloosa horse. According to AAFBI, the AraAppaloosa of today is considered a re-establishment or preservation of the best examples of the Appaloosa breed originally developed by the Nez Perce people of the American Pacific Northwest in the 18th and 19th centuries. The AAFBI believes that the backgrounds of leopard- spotted horses and the Arabian breed have much in common, with prototypes of each dating to antiquity. AAFBI notes that certain \\"oriental\\"-type horses were often particolored, as shown in Ancient Near East and Ancient Egyptian art. The association also promotes the standards set by one of the founders of the Appaloosa Horse Club, Claude Thompson, who, beginning in the 1930s, used Arabian blood in his Appaloosa breeding program and believed that Arabian blood was a crucial part of the Appaloosa genome. An AraAppaloosa in hunt seat competition Characteristics The AraAppaloosa exhibits the \\"leopard\\" or \\"Lp\\" gene and thus must have one of the color patterns found on the Appaloosa. They average from high. They are to have the general conformation of the Arabian, including a refined head, high-carried tail and overall elegance. Like both the Arabian and the Appaloosa, they should possess considerable endurance, sure-footedness, and intelligence. Overall, an AraAppaloosa will be of a more refined build than the more common type of Appaloosa, those with a high percentage of American Quarter Horse breeding, more commonly seen in the modern show ring.

Located in the Bosque de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Forest) in central Mexico City, it became the presidential seat in 1934, when Gen. L√°zaro C√°rdenas became the first president to live there. The term Los Pinos became a metonym for the Presidency of Mexico. Since December 2018, the former presidential complex has operated as a cultural space. History After the Spanish Conquest, around 1550 a trapiche (mill) was built in Chapultepec, where wheat and maize were processed into flour. This mill became so important that it was later called el Molino del Rey (\\"The King's Mill\\"). In 1853, the Molino del Rey was sold to Doctor Jos√© Pablo Martinez del Rio, who built the Casa Grande (\\"Big House\\") that would later become known as Rancho La Hormiga (\\"The Ant Ranch\\"). In 1865 the whole property was sold to Emperor Maximilian for a total of 25,000 Mexican pesos. Following the 1867 overthrow and execution of Maximilian, the property was, in 1872, returned to Doctor Martinez del Rio. Government residence In 1917, with the end of the armed phase of the Mexican Revolution, President Venustiano Carranza expropriated the properties, paying MX$ 886,473 for both the property and the construction of a residence that would be close to Chapultepec Castle (which at the time was used as the official residence) so that his most trustworthy cabinet member could live there. Because of this, the first inhabitant of the residence was √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n while he held the post of Navy and War Secretary. After his tenure the residence was unused. In 1934, President L√°zaro C√°rdenas took office but refused to use the Castle of Chapultepec as his official residence as he thought it too ostentatious. He was offered use of Rancho la Hormiga (The Ant Ranch), which he accepted. He changed its name to Los Pinos (The Pines) for two reasons: first, he did not consider the name La Hormiga to be accordant with the residence of a President and, second, he promised his wife that when he became president, the house they shared would be named after the huerta in Tac√°mbaro, Michoacan, where they met. Los Pinos was home to thirteen of the fourteen presidents in office between 1935 and 2018, with the exception of Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos (1958‚Äì1964). In 2000, President Vicente Fox chose one of the nearby cottages as his home and the Casa Miguel Alem√°n (residence of most prior presidents) was used for offices and other government functions. Cultural space Presidential Office at Los Pinos In 2018, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, at the time a candidate for the Mexican presidency, announced that he would not live in Los Pinos if he won the election and would instead open the residence to the public. L√≥pez Obrador won the election, and Los Pinos was opened to the public on December 1, 2018, the day of L√≥pez Obrador's presidential inauguration. L√≥pez Obrador moved the presidential offices back to the National Palace where he currently lives.

It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him/her in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his/her opponent (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack). *The Extra Attacks and the Boss Attack vary from one character to another. *The power gauge fills as the player destroys enemies up to three levels. By holding down the fire button and releasing when a certain level is reached, the player can launch a character-specific charge shot to assist the player in clearing enemies from his/her screen. At Level 1, the charge shot is launched. At Level 2, the charge shot and three Extra Attacks against the opponent are launched. At Level 3 (Max Level), the charge shot and a Boss Attack are launched. Firing charge shots at Level 2 and above will decrease the power gauge. *30‚Äì40 seconds into a round, a blue orb appears among a chain of enemies. If this orb is destroyed in a chain, the player achieves Fever status for the next several seconds. Chains created during Fever generate faster and more plentiful Normal Attacks per enemy destroyed, which can prove to be very dangerous to the opponent if large chains are made. *Both players are given five life points at the start of a round. *Colliding into an enemy costs 1 life point, but the player cannot be killed this way; if a player has one life point left, he/she will be left with one half of a life point. When this happens, his/her character is stunned for a short while and is reduced in speed and attack power for several seconds after recovery, all the while left more vulnerable to opponent attacks. *Getting hit by a Normal Attack, Reverse Attack, Extra Attack or the projectiles from a Boss cost 3 life points. *The match is over when either player loses all his/her life points. *When a player takes damage, his/her opponent recovers life points equal to half of the damage taken. *If a round lasts longer than 100 seconds or the player does not fire a shot for more than 30 seconds, a Death enemy appears. If a player is hit by this enemy, he/she will lose immediately (Death Attack). The Death can be destroyed as any other enemy, but always comes back, harder to kill. Additionally, if a player is successful in volleying the \\"death\\" character over to his/her opponent's side, and the death character touches the opponent, the opponent dies instantly. This is a possible, though difficult, way to win. This, of course, would require the player to be skilled enough to avoid obstacles and not fire for more than 30 seconds.  Development  Twinkle Star Sprites was developed by ADK. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ).  Release  While Twinkle Star Sprites was initially published as an arcade game by SNK for the Neo Geo platform, SNK later ported it to the Neo-Geo AES home console on January 31, 1997, and the Neo-Geo CD on February 21, 1997. On December 7, 1997, ADK developed and published an updated version of it to the Sega Saturn, featuring an anime-style intro, tweaked gameplay, a new character and a bonus 'Fan Disc' full of extra materials. After SNK ended up buying ADK's intellectual properties, SNK released another enhanced version of Twinkle Star Sprites for the Sega Dreamcast on March 23, 2000. To pay tribute to ADK, SNK included the Neo-Geo version along with four of ADK's other notable Neo-Geo titles in the compilation ADK Damashii, which was released for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan on December 8, 2008. Twinkle Star Sprites later became available on the subscription service GameTap. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console for Japan on August 9, 2011. A port developed by DotEmu for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and asm.js was released as part of the Humble NEOGEO 25th Anniversary Bundle on December 8, 2015. It was released on Steam on May 26, 2016; and on GOG.com on May 30, 2017. Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on February 21, 1997.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Twinkle Star Sprites on their January 1, 1997 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful arcade game of the year. Sequel is a 2005 sequel to Twinkle Star Sprites originally created by SNK. At E3 2005, it was shown at the SNK Booth. It is an enhanced re-vamp of the Neo-Geo title featuring fully 3D environments and a host of new characters. Clearing the game opens up a perfectly emulated version of the original Neo-Geo title. There was a possibility that it would be released in North America, but after some consideration, at E3 2006, Ben Herman, president of SNK Playmore USA, stated that the game will not be published in North America The decision was that it will not be marketable for the North American audience. The sequel was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation 2 on July 28, 2005, and was re-released for the same platform on November 22, 2006, with the green-label 'SNK Best Collection' added to the front cover.

It is best known as the initial primary training base for all U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard officers pursuing designation as naval aviators and naval flight officers, the advanced training base for most naval flight officers, and as the home base for the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the precision-flying team known as the Blue Angels. Because of contamination by heavy metals and other hazardous materials during its history, it is designated as a Superfund site needing environmental cleanup. The air station also hosts the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) and the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI), the latter of which provides training for all naval flight surgeons, aviation physiologists, and aerospace experimental psychologists. With the closure of Naval Air Station Memphis in Millington, Tennessee, and the transition of that facility to Naval Support Activity Mid-South, NAS Pensacola also became home to the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Memphis, which relocated to Pensacola and was renamed NATTC Pensacola. NATTC provides technical training schools for nearly all enlisted aircraft maintenance and enlisted aircrew specialties in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard. The NATTC facility at NAS Pensacola is also home to the USAF Detachment 1, a geographically separated unit (GSU) whose home unit is the 359th Training Squadron located at nearby Eglin AFB. Detachment 1 trains over 1,100 airmen annually in three structural maintenance disciplines: low observable, non-destructive inspection, and aircraft structural maintenance. NAS Pensacola contains Forrest Sherman Field, home of Training Air Wing SIX (TRAWING 6), providing undergraduate flight training for all prospective naval flight officers for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and flight officers/navigators for other NATO/Allied/Coalition partners. TRAWING SIX consists of the Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) \\"Warbucks\\", Training Squadron 10 (VT-10) \\"Wildcats\\" and Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) \\"Sabrehawks,\\" flying the T-45C Goshawk and T-6A Texan II. A select number of prospective U.S. Air Force navigator/combat systems officers, destined for certain fighter/bomber or heavy aircraft, were previously trained via TRAWING SIX, under VT-4 or VT-10, with command of VT-10 rotating periodically to a USAF officer. This previous track for USAF navigators was termed Joint Undergraduate Navigator Training (JUNT). Today, all USAF Undergraduate CSO Training (UCSOT) for all USAF aircraft is consolidated at NAS Pensacola as a strictly USAF organization and operation under the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) unit. The 479 FTG is a tenant activity at NAS Pensacola and a GSU of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas. The 479 FTG operates USAF T-6A Texan II and T-1A Jayhawk aircraft. Other tenant activities include the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, flying F/A-18 Hornets and a single USMC C-130T Hercules; and the 2nd German Air Force Training Squadron USA (‚Äì abbreviated \\"2.

The National Naval Aviation Museum (formerly known as the National Museum of Naval Aviation), the Pensacola Naval Air Station Historic District, the National Park Service-administered Fort Barrancas and its associated Advance Redoubt, and the Pensacola Lighthouse and Museum are all located at NAS Pensacola, as is the Barrancas National Cemetery. History The site now occupied by NAS Pensacola has been controlled by varying nations. In 1559, Spanish explorer Don Tristan de Luna founded a colony on Santa Rosa Island, considered the first European settlement of the Pensacola area. The Spanish built the wooden Fort San Carlos de Austria on this bluff in 1697‚Äì1698. Although besieged by Indians in 1707, the fort was not taken. Spain was competing in North America with the French, who settled lower Louisiana and the Illinois Country and areas to the North. The French destroyed this fort when they captured Pensacola in 1719. After Great Britain defeated the French in the Seven Years' War and exchanging some territory with Spain, British colonists took over this site and West Florida in 1763. In 1781, as an ally of the American rebels during the American Revolutionary War, the Spanish captured Pensacola. Britain ceded West Florida to Spain following the war. The Spanish completed the fort San Carlos de Barrancas in 1797. \\"The Forts of Pensacola Bay\\" (history), Visit Florida Online, 2006, webpage: VFO-Forts. \\"Fort San Carlos de Barrancas\\" (history), National Park Service (NPS), webpage: NPS-fort2. Barranca is a Spanish word for bluff, the natural terrain feature that makes this location ideal for the fortress. Pensacola was taken by General Andrew Jackson in November 1814 during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States. British forces destroyed Fort San Carlos as they swept through the area. The Spanish remained in control of the region until 1821, when the Adams-On√≠s Treaty confirmed the purchase of Spanish Florida by the United States, and Spain ceded this territory to the US. In 1825, the US designated this area for the Pensacola Navy Yard and Congress appropriated $6,000 for a lighthouse. Operational that year, it \\"is said to be haunted by a light keeper murdered by his wife.\\"Shettle, Jr., M. L., \\"United States Naval Air Stations of World War II, Volume I: Eastern States\\", Schaertel Publishing Co., Bowersville, Georgia, 1995, , , p. 178. Fort Barrancas was rebuilt, 1839‚Äì1844, the U.S. Army deactivating it on 15 April 1947. Designated a National Historic Site (NHL) in 1960, control of the site was transferred to the National Park Service in 1971. After extensive restoration during 1971‚Äì1980, Fort Barrancas was opened to the public. It has a visitor's center. Navy Yard Realizing the advantages of the Pensacola harbor and the large timber reserves nearby for shipbuilding, in 1825 President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of the Navy Samuel Southard made arrangements to build a Navy Yard on the southern tip of Escambia County, where the air station is today. Navy captains William Bainbridge, Lewis Warrington, and James Biddle selected the site on Pensacola Bay. Civilian employment Civilian employment began in April 1826, with the construction of the first buildings at the Pensacola Navy Yard, also known as the Warrington Navy Yard. Pensacola would later become one of the best equipped naval stations in the country but the early navy yard was beset with recruitment and labor problems. Skilled workers were simply unavailable locally, housing limited and living conditions in Pensacola rough. At first skilled tradesmen were recruited from Boston and other northern naval bases. Many of these new civilians employees were dissatisfied with local conditions and especially their wages and hours. As a result, on 14 March 1827 was the first labor strike. Captain Melancthon Taylor Woolsey was able to make sufficient adjustments to the workday that the men returned to work after a couple of days.Dibble, Ernest F., Antebellum Pensacola and the Military Presence, Pensacola Series Commemorating the American Revolution Bicentennial 3, Pensacola, FL: Pensacola/Escambia Development Commission, 1974 p. 13. One factor that inhibited both military and civilian workers from remaining in Pensacola was the lack of an adequate hospital. On 3 November 1828, naval surgeon Isaac Hulse, physician in charge of the Naval Hospital in Barrancas Florida wrote Commodore Melanchthon Taylor Woolsey a status report. His account covers the period of March to November 1828 and details the 66 sailors and marines admitted, their names and rank, diagnosis or the nature of their injury, and the date of their discharge or death. Mortality at Pensacola would remain high due to the prevalence of Yellow Fever and Malaria. Many naval officers and men considered the Navy Yard an unhealthy and potentially lethal assignment. For example, Naval Constructor Samuel Keep writing to his brother in July 1826 stated emphatically, \\"I shall not remain here unless I am obliged to do so.\\"Sharp, John G. Naval Surgeon Isaac Hulse re his patients at Naval Hospital Barrancas, 3 November 1828 http://genealogytrails.com/fla/escambia/1827navalhosp.html Despite heroic efforts by the medical community yellow fever would revisit the navy yard intermittently e.g. 1835, 1874, 1882, etc., the disease only coming under control with the work of Major Walter Reed in 1901.Yellow Fever Pensapedia accessed 2 June 2017 http://www.pensapedia.com/wiki/Yellow_fever Sketch of Surgeon Isaac Hulse USN (1797 - 1856 ) as a young man.

In May 1829 the monthly Pensacola Navy Yard list of mechanics and labors enumerates a total of 87 employees, of which 37 were enslaved laborers.Sharp John G. List of Mechanics, Laborers, &c; employed in the Navy Yard Pensacola May 1829 http://genealogytrails.com/fla/escambia/pnyemployees1829.html Pensacola Navy Yard was built with enslaved labor. Captain Lewis Warrington the first commandant of the Pensacola Navy Yard complained to the Board of Navy Commissioners \\"neither laborers nor mechanics are to be obtained here.\\" As early as April 1826 Warrington had requested and received permission to hire enslaved labor, \\" for I would recommend the employment of black laborers in preference to white, as they suit this climate better, are less liable to change, more easily controlled, more temperate, and more will actually do more work.\\"Dibble, p. 23. Even after Warrington was finally able to get skilled white journeymen mechanics from Norfolk, he asked for and received permission to continue utilizing enslaved labor since due to the unhealthy conditions and poor pay white laborers simply would not remain at the new naval station. As a consequence Pensacola Navy agent Samuel R. Overton advertised for 38 enslaved workers promising local slaveholders \\"17 dollars per month with common Navy Rations.\\"Pensacola Gazette 6 April 1827, p. 5. The bondsman's names are found on the May 1829 list of navy yard employees.Sharp May 1829 List of Mechanics To allay slaveholder concerns, Commandant William Compton Bolton advertised that enslaved workers would have the benefit of medical attention at no charge at the shipyard hospital.Floridian and Advocate 10 September 1836 p. 1 Pensacola was not the first to use enslaved labor, Washington Navy Yard established 1799 and soon after at Gosport Navy Yard in Virginia both employed enslaved labor. The enslaved quickly \\"constituted a majority of the employees at the shipyard. They performed nearly every task required including ship construction and repair, carpentry, blacksmithing, bricklaying and general labor.\\"Clavin,Matthew J. Aiming for Pensacola Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2015, p. 84. While not explicitly stated in Pensacola Navy Yard log entries, enslaved black workers were listed as ‚Äúlaborers‚Äù while white workers were categorized as belonging to ‚Äúthe ordinary.‚Äù(see thumbnail: station log entries, 1 July 1836).Sharp, John G.M. Early Pensacola Navy Yard in Letters and Documents to the Secretary of the Navy and Board of Navy Commissioners 1826-1840, Part II Dibble, Ernest F. Antebellum Pensacola and the Military Presence,p.72 . The payrolls of Pensacola Navy Yard reflect that enslaved laborers were leased from prominent members of local Pensacola society.

Slavery remained integral to the Pensacola Navy Yard workforce throughout the antebellum period. As late as June 1855, the navy yard payroll listed 155 slaves.Ericson, David F.Slavery in the American Republic Developing the Federal Government, 1791 -1861 (University of Kansas Press:Lawrence Kansas 2011),259n55. Scholar Ernest Dibble concludes his study of the military presence in Pensacola with this coda \\"In Pensacola the military was not just the most important single force creating the local economy, but also the most important single influence to the spread of the slaveocracy in Pensacola.\\"Dibble, Ernest F.

The U.S.Navy in Pensacola From Sailing Ships to Naval Aviation (1825‚Äì1930) University of West Florida: Pensacola 1980 pp. 62‚Äì63. In its early years, the garrison of the West Indies Squadron dealt mainly with the suppression of the African slave trade and piracy in the Gulf and Caribbean. The US and Great Britain had outlawed the international slave trade effective 1808, but smuggling continued for decades, especially as Cuba and certain South American nations continued with slavery. Forts and batteries near the Navy Yard on 27 May 1861 On 12 January 1861, just prior to the commencement of the Civil War, the Warrington Navy Yard surrendered to secessionists.Miller, J. Michael. \\"Marine's Telling of 1861 Florida Navy Yard Fall Given\\", Fortitudine, vol XX, no. 4 (Spring 1991): 8. When Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862, Confederate troops, fearing attack from the west, retreated from the Navy Yard and reduced most of the facilities to rubble. At the time, they also abandoned Fort Barrancas and Fort McRee. After the war, the ruins at the yard were cleared away and work was begun to rebuild the base. Many of the present structures on the air station were built during this period, including the stately two- and three-story houses on North Avenue. In 1906, many of these newly rebuilt structures were destroyed by a great hurricane and storm surge. The Pensacola and Fort Barrancas Railroad was constructed in 1870 during the Reconstruction era, bringing rail service aboard the Navy Yard, and improving connections to the city of Pensacola. The company was incorporated by a special act of the State of Florida on 12 February 1870 to improve infrastructure, and was granted an easement by Congress to run through the federal Navy Yard reservation on 30 January 1871.Turner, Gregg M., A Journey Into Florida Railroad History, University Press of Florida, , , p. 94. Naval aeronautical station NAS Pensacola in 1918 The Navy Department awakened to the possibilities of naval aviation through the efforts of Captain Washington Irving Chambers; he prevailed upon Congress to include in the Naval Appropriation Act enacted in 1911‚Äì12 a provision for aeronautical development. Chambers was ordered to devote all of his time to naval aviation. In October 1913, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, appointed a board, with Captain Chambers as chairman, to make a survey of aeronautical needs and to establish a policy to guide future development. One of the board's most important recommendations was the establishment of an aviation training station in Pensacola. On 20 January 1914, LCdr. Henry C. Mustin, Naval Aviator No. 11, and Lt. John H. Towers, Naval Aviator No. 3, and Lt. Patrick N. L. Bellinger, Naval Aviator No. 8, arrived in Pensacola on the former battleship USS Mississippi with the men and aircraft from the Naval Aviation Camp at Annapolis, Maryland. \\"The aviation unit consisted of nine officers, 23 enlisted men, and seven aircraft.\\"Shettle, Jr., M. L., United States Naval Air Stations of World War II, Volume I: Eastern States, Schaertel Publishing Co., Bowersville, Georgia, 1995, , , p. 177. The first flight occurred on 2 February 1914, with Lt. Towers and Ens. Godfrey deC. Chevalier, Naval Aviator No. 7, at the controls. Upon the entry of the United States into World War I on 6 April 1917, Pensacola, still the only naval air station, had 38 naval aviators, 163 enlisted men trained in aviation support, and 54 fixed-wing aircraft. Two years later, by the signing of the armistice in November 1918, the air station, with 438 officers and 5,538 enlisted men, had trained 1,000 naval aviators. At war's end, seaplanes, dirigibles, and free kite balloons were housed in steel and wooden hangars stretching a mile down the air station beach. In the years following World War I, aviation training slowed down. An average of 100 pilots were graduating annually from the 12-month flight course. This was before the category of aviation cadets was established; officers were accepted for the flight training program only after at least two years of sea duty. The majority were Annapolis graduates, although a few reserve officers and enlisted men also graduated. Naval Air Station Pensacola became known as the \\"Annapolis of the Air\\". Station Field was created on the north side of the navy yard in 1922. Enlarged, it was renamed Chevalier Field in 1935 for Lt. Cdr. Godfrey DeCourcelles Chevalier, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in 1910, and an early Naval Air Pilot, designated as No. 7 on 7 November 1915. With the advent of jet aviation, its 3,100-foot runway was too short for new aircraft entering service. Forrest Sherman Field was opened in 1954 for most fixed-wing operations. Naval air station With the inauguration in 1935 of the cadet training program, activity at Pensacola again expanded. When Pensacola's training facilities could no longer accommodate the ever-increasing number of cadets accepted by the Navy, two more naval air stations were created‚Äîone in Jacksonville, Florida, and the other in Corpus Christi, Texas. (During this period, the Southern Democratic block exerted considerable influence in Congress, as the South was a one-party region. Democrats occupied key committee chairman positions by seniority and directed many projects to their region.) In August 1940, a larger auxiliary base, Saufley Field, named for LT R.C. Saufley, Naval Aviator 14, was added to Pensacola's activities. In October 1941, a third field, Ellyson Field, named after CDR Theodore G. \\"Spuds\\" Ellyson, the Navy's first aviator, was added. Aerial view of NAS Pensacola in the mid-1940s. Chevalier Field is at the upper right. With the start of World War II, NAS Pensacola once again became the hub of air training activities. NAS Pensacola expanded again, training 1,100 cadets a month, 11 times the number trained annually in the 1920s. The growth of NAS Pensacola from 10 tents to the world's greatest naval aviation center was emphasized by then-Senator Owen Brewster's statement: \\"The growth of naval aviation during World War II is one of the wonders of the modern world.\\" Naval aviators from NAS Pensacola were called upon to train the Doolittle Raiders at Eglin Field in 1942 for carrier take-offs in their B-25 Mitchell bombers. Navy Lt. Henry Miller supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch. For his efforts, Lt. Miller is considered an honorary member of the Raider group.Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, Memorial site of Richard O. Joyce During the Korean War, the military was caught in the midst of transition from propellers to jets. The air station had to revise its courses and training techniques. NAS Pensacola produced 6,000 aviators from 1950 to 1953. Forrest Sherman Field was opened in 1954 on the western side of NAS Pensacola. This jet airfield was named after the late Admiral Forrest P. Sherman, a former chief of naval operations. Shortly thereafter the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, relocated from NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. Pilot training requirements shifted upward to meet the demands for the Vietnam War, which occupied much of the 1960s and 1970s. From a low of 1,413 in 1962, before the entry of the US in any substantive way, pilot training in 1968 produced 2,552 graduates. Naval aviation depot From the earliest days of naval aviation at Pensacola, an aircraft maintenance facility operated at the air station. Initially known as the Construction and Repair Department, in 1923 it was redesignated an Assembly and Repair Department, and in 1948 to the Overhaul and Repair Department. In 1967, the status of the facility at NAS Pensacola and at five other Navy and one Marine Corps air stations were changed to that of separate commands, each called a Naval Air Rework Facility and directed to report to the commander of the Naval Air Systems Command instead of the air station commanding officer. Former seaplane hangars along the south edge of the air station, as well as a large structure at Chevalier Field were utilized for aircraft overhauls, and Pensacola was a designated as an A-4 Skyhawk rework site. In 1987 the name Naval Aviation Depot replaced the name Naval Air Rework Facility to more accurately reflect the range of their activities. Three Naval Aviation Depots were closed under the 1993 BRAC Committee recommendations including that at NAS Pensacola, and most of the buildings on the air station involved in these tasks razed.United States General Accounting Office, \\"Closing Maintenance Depots: Savings, Workload, and Redistribution Issues\\", United States General Accounting Office / National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C., GAO/NSIAD-96-29, March 1996, Appendix I ‚Äì History of the Services' Depot Systems, p. 62. Naval Photography School Monthly inspection of the Naval Photography School at NAS Pensacola, 29 July 1944. Photograph by Joseph Janney Steinmetz The Naval Photography School was located at base. Howard Zieff learned photography there and the monthly inspection at the school was photographed by Joseph Janney Steinmetz in 1944. The Naval Photographic School trained Navy Marine Corps and Coast Guard students in basic (A School), advanced (B and C Schools), and special curriculum (Reconnaissance, Photojournalism, etc.) It was housed in BlDG 1500, now the base headquarters, and a small museum has a variety of items from the school.US Marine Corps SGT James Karney, US Naval Photography School graduate Modern history Flyover with sailors in formation In 1971, NAS Pensacola was picked as the headquarters site for CNET (Chief of Naval Education and Training), a new command which combined direction and control of all Navy education and training activities and organizations. The Naval Air Basic Training Command was absorbed by the Naval Air Training Command, which moved to NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. In 2003, CNET was replaced by the Naval Education and Training Command(NETC). Also located on board NAS Pensacola is Naval Aviation Schools Command (NAVAVSCOLSCOM). This command has the following subordinate schools: *Aviation Enlisted Aircrew Training School (AEATS) ** AETAS is also known as Naval Aircrew Candidate School (NACCS) *Naval Aviation Technical Training Center (NATTC) **NATTC is composed of \\"A\\" schools for training of enlisted personnel in various aviation support disciplines including: ground support equipment operators, aviation ordnancemen, aircraft powerplant mechanics, fixed and rotary wing structural airframe mechanics, avionics technicians, aircraft electricians, aviation command and control electronics maintenance personnel, expeditionary airfield construction personnel, air traffic controllers, flight equipment technicians, enlisted aircrew, and parachute riggers. Courses in these disciplines are attended by both Navy personnel and U.S. Marines. Marines aboard NAS Pensacola training for or teaching courses in the aforementioned jobs belong to Marine Air Training Support Group 23 (MATSG-23), which consists of both Aviation Maintenance Squadron 1 (AMS-1) and AMS-2. *Crew Resource Management *U.S. Navy and Marine Corps School of Aviation Safety NAVAVSCOLSCOM also previously oversaw Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) until that program's disestablishment and merger into Officer Candidate School (OCS) under Officer Training Command at NETC Newport, Rhode Island in 2007. The Pensacola Naval Complex in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel. During the 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), people in Florida and the Navy feared that NAS Pensacola might be closed, despite its naval hub status, due to extensive damage by Hurricane Ivan in late 2004. Nearly every building on the installation had suffered heavy damage, with near total destruction of the air station's southeastern complex . The main barracks, Chevalier Hall, did not reopen until late January 2005, four months after the storm. When the list was released on 13 May 2005, NAS Pensacola and other military bases hit by Ivan in Northwest Florida were not on the BRAC list. Their facilities were rebuilt. Archaeologists examine the remains of 16th century shipwreck on the beach at NAS Pensacola In May 2006, Navy construction crews unearthed a Spanish ship during an archeological excavation. It may date to the mid-16th century. The ship remains were discovered during the rebuilding of the base's rescue swimmer school, which was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan., Albuquerque Tribune On March 3, 2010 the commander of the base, Captain William Reavey Jr., was relieved of command after a Navy investigation into alleged improper conduct. Reavey was replaced by Captain Christopher Plummer.Tilghman, Andrew, \\"NAS Pensacola CO's firing made permanent\\", Military Times, March 4, 2010. United States Air Force at NAS Pensacola NAS Pensacola is host to the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). The 479 FTG is composed of the 451st Flying Training Squadron, 455th Flying Training Squadron and 479th Operations Support Squadron. The 479 FTG is part of the 12th Flying Training Wing at Randolph AFB, Texas, but student information and files are handled through Tyndall AFB, Florida while they train at NAS Pensacola. With the divestment of Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT) and the retirement of the T-43 Bobcat from the 12th Flying Training Wing main operation at Randolph AFB, the 479 FTG assumed responsibility for the renamed Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) for all prospective USAF CSOs. The 479 FTG operates USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft at NAS Pensacola. NAS Pensacola is also home to AETC's Detachment 1, 359th Training Squadron (359 TRS). A geographically separated unit of the 359 TRS at Eglin AFB, Florida, and falls under the 82nd Training Wing (82 TRW) at Sheppard AFB, Texas. This school provides enlisted technical training for all USAF Low Obersavable Aircraft Structural Maintenance, Non-Destructive Inspections (NDI) and Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM) students. The 359 TRS, Det 1, graduates approximately 1200 students annually. The USAF's Detachment 2, 66th Training Squadron (a geographically separated part of the 336th Training Group's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) school at Fairchild Air Force Base) was located here at NAS Pensacola, dedicated to aircrew parachute water survival training, but relocated to Fairchild AFB in August 2015.Parachute water survival moves to Fairchild Incidents and accidents On 20 February 1939, a squadron of twelve U.S. Navy aircraft, described as \\"fast combat ships\\", were returning to NAS Pensacola, Florida, from a routine training trip and found the Gulf Coast socked in by a fog described as one of the heaviest ever witnessed in the region.

Born in Georgia to a mixed-race slave mother and Irish immigrant father, he identified and was accepted as White Irish American, as he was half Irish and majority European ancestry. When he was ordained in 1854, knowledge of his mixed-race ancestry was largely restricted to his mentors in the Church.A.D. Powell, XVIII. \\"When Are Irish- Americans Not Good Enough to Be Irish-American? Racial Kidnapping and the Healy Family\\", in Passing for What You Really Are: Essays in Support of Multiracial Whiteness, Palm Coast, Florida: Backintyme, 2005, accessed 8 February 2011 (Augustus Tolton, a former slave who was publicly known to be African-American when ordained in 1886, is for that reason sometimes credited as the first African-American Catholic priest rather than Healy.) Healy was one of nine mixed-race siblings of the Catholic Healy family of Georgia who survived to adulthood and achieved many \\"firsts\\" in United States history; his brothers Patrick and Alexander also became Catholic priests. James is credited with greatly expanding the Catholic church in Maine at a time of increased Irish immigration, and he also served Abenaki people and many parishioners of French Canadian descent who were traditionally Catholic. He spoke both English and French. Family and education James Healy was the eldest of 10 siblings born near Macon, Georgia, in 1839\\"Captain Michael A. Healy, USRCS\\", US Coast Guard, accessed 10 July 2012 to Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and his common-law wife Eliza Smith (sometimes recorded as Clark), a mixed-race enslaved African American. Born in 1795, the senior Healy immigrated from County Roscommon in Ireland in 1818. He eventually acquired of land in Jones County, Georgia, across the Ocmulgee River from the market town of Macon, Georgia. He became among the more prominent and successful planters of the area, and eventually owned 49-60 slaves for his cotton plantation, which was labor-intensive.Albert S. Foley, Bishop Healy: Beloved Outcaste], Farrar, Strauss & Young, 1954, pp. 6-7. He says Healy owned more than 1600 acres and 60 slaves by 1840. Among these was a young slave woman named Mary Eliza Smith, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Various accounts have described Mary Eliza as \\"slave\\" or \\"former slave,\\" and as mulatto or African American (the latter term includes people of mixed ancestry). The common-law marriage of Michael and Mary Healy was not unusual among immigrants; but state law prohibited interracial marriage. Most of their ten children, all but one of whom survived to adulthood, achieved noteworthy success as adults, helped by Healy's financial success and the educations he gained for them in the North. Beginning in 1837, like many other wealthy planters with mixed-race children, Michael Healy started sending his sons to school in the North. James, Hugh and Patrick went to Quaker schools in Flushing, New York, and Burlington, New Jersey. Later they each attended the newly opened College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. James graduated as valedictorian of the college's first graduating class in 1849. Younger brothers Sherwood began at Holy Cross in 1844, and Michael in 1849 in its grammar school. Career Following graduation, James wished to enter the priesthood. He could not study at the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, as it was a slave state. With the help of John Bernard Fitzpatrick, James entered a Sulpician seminary in Montreal. In 1852, he transferred to study at Saint Sulpice Seminary in Paris, working toward a doctorate and a career as a seminary professor. After a change of heart, he decided to become a pastor. On June 10, 1854, he was ordained at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as a priest to serve in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the first African American to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest; at the time he identified as and was accepted as white Irish Catholic. During the 19th century, numerous Americans studied for the priesthood in Paris. When Healy returned to the United States, he became an assistant pastor in Boston. He served the Archbishop, who helped establish his standing in the church. In 1866 Healy became the pastor of St. James Church, the largest Catholic congregation in Boston. In 1874 when the Boston legislature was considering taxation of churches, Healy defended Catholic institutions as vital organizations that helped the state both socially and financially. He also condemned certain laws that were generally enforced only on Catholic institutions. He founded several Catholic charitable institutions to care for the many poor Irish immigrants who had arrived during the Great Famine years. His success in the public sphere led to his appointment by Pope Pius IX to the position of second bishop of Portland, Maine. Healy was consecrated as Bishop of Portland on June 2, 1875, becoming the first African American to be consecrated a Catholic bishop. For 25 years he governed his large diocese, supervising also the founding of the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, when it was split from Portland in 1885. During his time in Maine, which was a period of extensive immigration from Catholic countries, Healy oversaw the establishment of 60 new churches, 68 missions, 18 convents, and 18 schools.\\"James Augustine Healy\\", Georgia Bulletin, 16 March 1978 He was the only member of the American Catholic hierarchy to excommunicate men who joined the Knights of Labor, a national union, which reached its peak of power in 1886.James Hennesey, S.J., American Catholics, Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 188 Two months before his death, Healy was called as assistant to the Papal throne by Pope Leo XIII, a position in the Catholic hierarchy just below that of cardinal.

Siblings All four of the older Healy brothers (James, Hugh, Patrick, and Sherwood) graduated from Holy Cross College. Hugh decided to go into business in New York. He died at age 21 from an infection contracted in a boating accident. Patrick and Sherwood each entered the priesthood. Patrick Francis Healy became a Jesuit, earned a PhD in Paris, and is now considered the first African American to have gained the degree. He was named a dean at Georgetown University in 1866. At the age of 39, in 1874, he assumed the presidency of what was then the largest Catholic college in the United States. Alexander Sherwood Healy was also ordained as a priest, and earned his doctorate degree at the Sulpician Academy in Paris; he became an expert in canon law and Gregorian chant. After working with his brother James in Boston for a time, Sherwood was appointed director of the Catholic seminary in Troy, New York, and later as rector of the Cathedral in Boston. His career was cut short by his death at age 39. Younger brother Michael Augustine Healy preferred a more adventuresome life. He left school at the age of 16 to go to sea. In England, he signed aboard the East Indian clipper Jumna as a cabin boy in 1854; he quickly became an expert seaman, rising to an officer. In 1864, Michael Healy returned to his family in Boston. He applied for a commission in the Revenue Cutter Service (predecessor to the Coast Guard) and was accepted as a Third Lieutenant, his commission being signed by President Lincoln.The Coast Guard Expands, 1865-1915, Irving H. King, Naval Institute Press, 1996, p. 39, In 1880, Healy was assigned command of a US government ship. (Since the late 20th century, he has become known as the first African American to gain such command.) During the last two decades of the 19th century, Captain Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast Alaska Territory. Commissioned in 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard research icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) is named in his honor. The three Healy daughters became nuns. Martha, the first, left the order after several years and moved to Boston, where her brothers were. She married an Irish immigrant and they had one son. Josephine Healy joined the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph in Canada. Eliza Healy (1846‚Äì1918) joined the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal. After teaching for years at Catholic schools in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 she was appointed as Mother Superior at a Catholic convent and school, the Villa, in St. Albans, Vermont. Since the late 20th century, she has been known as the first African American to gain the position as abbess. \\"Eliza Healy, Sister Mary Magdalen (1846-1918), accessed 7 February 2011 Eugene Healy (1848-?), the youngest son, was reported by Albert S.

Tosa Mitsuoki succeeded his father, Tosa Mitsunori (1583‚Äì1638), as head of the Tosa school and brought the Tosa school to Kyoto after around 50 years in Sakai. When the school was settled in Sakai, Mitsunori painted for townsmen. The school was not as prolific as it once was when Mitsunobu, who painted many fine scrolls (1434‚Äì1525) ran the school. Mitsuoki moved out of Sakai with his father, in 1634 and into the city of Kyoto. There, he hoped to revive the Tosa school to gain status back into the Kyoto court. Around the time of 1654 he gained a position as court painter (edokoro azukari) that had for many years traditionally been held by the Tosa family, but was in possession of the Kano school since the late Muromachi period (1338‚Äì1573). Reclaim to fame In 1654, Mitsuoki restored fortune to the family school when he earned the title of the edokoro azukari, which means \\"head of the court painting bureau\\". Now the Tosa school was once again the highlight of the court. The school prospered throughout the Edo period, during the years of 1600 to 1868. Mitsuoki can be considered as the last groundbreaking painter of the Tosa school. He was succeeded by a long line of painters, starting with his son, Mitsunari (1646‚Äì1710). Many of the successors used the same techniques and syle of painting as Mitsuoki, which gradually led to their works becoming repetitive throughout the Edo period. The lack of innovation produced many scrolls that could be seen as done by Mitsuoki himself. Another school in effect around the same time called the Kan≈ç school, flourished just as the successors of the Tosa school. After Death The later Tosa style of the eighteenth century showed very little strength or promise due to loss of patrons and overshadowing from the Kan≈ç school. The school was affected by the growing popularity of the study of Japanese history and the rise of the imperial family. Around the nineteenth century, there was a distinct revival under two artist named Tanaka Totsugen and Reizei Tamechika who specialized in repeating Mitsuoki‚Äôs work. Their work reaffirmed the Japanese spirit of Yamato-e, which they made many copies. Their art reflected political philosophy and sometimes had a historical connecting because several of the artists were also faithful to the imperial cause. The two artists were revivalists, and got so caught up in painting historical figures, that they overlooked the special greatness of the early artists who specialized in movement and realism. The most successful successors invented their own artistic style but kept the predecessors tradition of painting in strong color with an intense feeling of natural beauty. Style Mitsuoki was known for reintroducing the Yamato-e style. Yamato-e (Â§ßÂíåÁµµ) is a style of ancient Japanese painting inspired by paintings in the Tang dynasty. It was later reinvented and further refined in the late Heian period. It is considered the classical Japanese style. In the Muromachi period (15th century), the term Yamato-e has been used to show the contrast between it and work from other contemporary Chinese style paintings, which were inspired by Yuan and Sung dynasty Buddhist paintings. The Yamato-e style often tells narrative stories and themes, sometimes accompanied with text. Other variations of Yamato-e concentrated on showing the beauty of nature, famous places, or the four seasons of winter, fall, spring and summer. Mitsuoki‚Äôs pictures were often on scrolls that can be hung on a wall, otherwise known as kakemono (Êéõ„ÅëÁâ©) or handscrolls (emakimono) that could be read from right to left with the accompanied story. He also produced many works on folding screen panels that featured up to six panels. Although they had received their name during the Yamato period, Yamato-e works stood for a style and are not restricted to that particular time period. Yamato-e was such a popular style at the time, that it even had a great influence on the Rimpa and ukiyo-e styles. It even had a small influence on the Kano school style. One of the best Yamato-e painters of the time was Mitsuoki. His paintings reintroduced subject matter into the arts. His urbanized surroundings heavily influenced his style, with a wide angle of art ranging from \\"Quails and Flowers\\", to tree and scenery paintings on gold leaf screens. Mitsuoki reinstated the Tosa school style by incorporating the space and light touch somewhat similar to the earlier Song dynasty and Yuan dynasty (AD 960‚Äì1279) Chinese court paintings. He also put greater stress on ink brushwork. Mitsuoki had a style that was decorative, refined, and precise all at the same time, and throughout his career he maintained a consistent delivery. The birds and the landscapes were soft and delicate lines formed some inspiring pieces filled with beauty. His light- hearted linework, originality of design, and excellent execution, Mitsuoki combined tones which were bright without hardness, sometimes with touches of gold forming a harmony of color that was hard to find in his era. He became one of the most renowned Japanese exponents of bird-and-flower (kach≈ç) painting in the Chinese court manner and is especially noted in his precise depictions of quail. His flower pieces were elegant, and given some tender sediment. Mitsuoki's sternness of his older style, never lost its dignity, but gained gentleness and tranquility. The Emperor, nobles and rich families collected and preserved his books. His Works *Kitano Tenjin engi emaki ‚Äì a picture scroll depicting the chronicle of the Kitano Shrine *Itsukushima Matsushima zu-by≈çbu ‚Äì Picture Screens of Itsukushima and Matsushima *Kiku jun zu ‚Äì A Quail and Chrysanthemums *Quail and Millet Screen *Ono no Komachi ‚Äì Ink and color on silk, hanging scroll *Quail and Poem The Tosa School The Tosa school, in its own history, expressly stated that the school founded in the ninth century owed nothing to the influence of China. But the style of the Tosa school looks like it was greatly influenced by Chinese painting. Apart from religious subjects, it occupied a special position in art specializing in the taste of the Court of Kyoto. Quails and Peacocks, cherry tree branches in flower, cocks and hens, Daimy≈çs with their samurai in gorgeous ceremonial costumes, were painted as time went on with extreme care and patience and attention to detail. As the years went on, their style became more and more precise, almost down to a science. The Tosa painters towards the end of their popularity, lost much of their prestige to artists of the later Kan≈ç school, whose studies included a wider scope and bigger variety of subject matter. The paintings of the Tosa school were distinguished by the elegance and precision of its design, while their counterparts, the Kan≈ç school, was well known for its power and freedom of design. Tosa School and Kan≈ç School If the past works of the Tosa school and Kan≈ç school are closely observed, there is clear proof that both of the traditional schools have a similar way of handling their draftsmanship. Both were patronized from the Japanese courts around the same time period, and specialized in Yamato-e and ukiyo-e paintings. At the same time, they both served different uses within the Edo court. Kan≈ç painters were usually commissioned to paint the screens and hanging scrolls displayed in official audience halls and other public spaces in sh≈çgun and daimy≈ç residences where men gathered and intermixed. The courtly style of the Tosa artists, on the other hand, was usually deemed more appropriate for the decorations of the private rooms occupied by women and children and for the albums and scrolls that were often included in weddings. However, there was a clear stylistic relationship among the members of the two schools. Not just the artwork was similar between the Tosa school and the Kan≈ç school, the family line between the two has even been crossed at one time. The daughter of Tosa Mitsunobu married Kan≈ç Motonobu. After the decline in popularity of the Tosa school during Mitsumochi's period (1496‚Äì1559), the Kano school overshadowed it and the Tosa school's artists usually worked under Kano school artists, sometimes helping sketch out final pieces for Kan≈ç artists. The lack of innovation in the Tosa school style made a disconnection with the Japanese public because it did not capture the peoples hopes and dreams. Arts in Edo during Mitsuoki's life After Tokugawa Ieyasu established Edo, the city went into a long period of isolation. The third sh≈çgun of Tokugawa, shut off Japan from the world to make his hold more secure, besides very limited contacts at the port of Nagasaki. Differences of opinion among the Christian missionaries who had been in Japan for nearly a century helped to bring about the exclusionist policy which at around 1637, closed Japan to all foreign interaction. During this time, Edo Japan flourished into a very political economic and artistic center of Japan. It slowly grew to be one of the largest cities of the world, and its art in many ways showed the spirit of the new and boisterous metropolis. This is when Edo saw an emerging middle class. Fortunately the activities of each class, as long as they did not seem to conflict with the prestige of the higher-ranked military clans, were allowed to develop their own social styles and culture. Before this, the arts were usually reserved for the upper class and the more fortunate courts. Artists were not under the Kyoto courts pressure to produce work only for the higher class. In the \\"floating world\\", artists were free to select their own style and even their own target audience. With this, arose new types of art appropriate to the interests of merchants and the middle class. Art was no longer reserved for the elite class, now it belonged to whoever could afford it. The Sh≈çgun of Edo and the Kyoto court continued to support the Tosa school as well as the other prominent school of the time, such as the Kano school.

A Century of Black Surgeons, The U.S.A. Experience, Chapter 8, p. 311 Daniel Hale Williams, MD; Transcript Press, Norman OK, 1987 He founded Chicago's Provident Hospital, the first non-segregated hospital in the United States and also founded an associated nursing school for African Americans. The heart surgery at Provident, which his patient survived for the next twenty years, is referred to as \\"the first successful heart surgery\\" by Encyclopedia Britannica. In 1913, Williams was elected as the only African-American charter member of the American College of Surgeons. Career When Daniel Hale Williams graduated from what is today Northwestern University Medical School, he opened a private practice where his patients were white and black. Black doctors, however, were not allowed to work in America's private hospitals. As a result, in 1891, Williams founded the Provident Hospital, which also provided a training residency for doctors and training school for nurses in Chicago. This was established mostly for the benefit of African-American residents, to increase their accessibility to health care, but its staff and patients were integrated from the start. In 1893, Williams became the first African American on record to have successfully performed pericardium surgery to repair a wound. On September 6, 1891, Henry Dalton was the first American to successfully perform pericardium surgery to repair a wound. Earlier successful surgeries to drain the pericardium, by performing a pericardiostomy were done by Francisco Romero in 1801 and Dominique Jean Larrey in 1810. On July 10, 1893, Williams repaired the torn pericardium of a knife wound patient, James Cornish. Cornish, who was stabbed directly through the left fifth costal cartilage, had been admitted the previous night. Williams decided to operate the next morning in response to continued bleeding, cough and \\"pronounced\\" symptoms of shock. He performed this surgery, without the benefit of penicillin or blood transfusion, at Provident Hospital, Chicago. It was not reported until 1897. He undertook a second procedure to drain fluid. About fifty days after the initial procedure, Cornish left the hospital. In 1893, during the administration of President Grover Cleveland, Williams was appointed surgeon-in-chief of Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C., a post he held until 1898. That year he married Alice Johnson, who was born in the city and graduated from Howard University, and moved back to Chicago. In addition to organizing Provident Hospital, Williams also established a training school for African-American nurses at the facility. In 1897, he was appointed to the Illinois Department of Public Health, where he worked to raise medical and hospital standards. Williams was a Professor of Clinical Surgery at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, and was an attending surgeon at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. He worked to create more hospitals that admitted African Americans. In 1895 he co-founded the National Medical Association for African-American doctors, and in 1913 he became a charter member and the only African-American doctor in the American College of Surgeons. However, he died in relative obscurity. His retirement home was in Idlewild, Michigan, a black community. Personal life Later photo of Williams. Daniel Hale Williams was born in 1856 and raised in the city of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. His father, Daniel Hale Williams Jr., was the son of a Scots-Irish woman and a Black barber.Bigelow (1992), p. 254 His mother was African American and likely also mixed race. The fifth child born, Williams lived with his parents, a brother and five sisters. His family eventually moved to Annapolis, Maryland. Shortly after when Williams was nine, his father died of tuberculosis. Williams' mother realized she could not manage the entire family and sent some of the children to live with relatives. Williams was apprenticed to a shoemaker in Baltimore, Maryland but ran away to join his mother, who had moved to Rockford, Illinois. He later moved to Edgerton, Wisconsin, where he joined his sister and opened his own barber shop. After moving to nearby Janesville, Wisconsin, Williams became fascinated by the work of a local physician and decided to follow his path. He began working as an apprentice to Dr. Henry W. Palmer, studying with him for two years. In 1880, Williams entered Chicago Medical College, now known as Northwestern University Medical School. After graduation from Northwestern in 1883, he opened his own medical office in Chicago, Illinois. Williams was married in 1898 to Alice Johnson, natural daughter of American sculptor Moses Jacob Ezekiel and a mixed-race maid. Williams died of a stroke in Idlewild, Michigan on August 4, 1931. His wife, Alice Johnson, had died in 1924. Legacy In the 1890s several attempts were made to improve cardiac surgery. On September 6, 1891 the first successful pericardial sac repair operation in the United States of America was performed by Henry C. Dalton of Saint Louis, Missouri.http://mail.blockyourid.com/~gbpprorg/invention/heartsurgery.html The first successful surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on September 4, 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.Absolon KB, Naficy MA (2002).

History of Cardiac Surgery, 1896‚Äì1955. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. p. 5. Despite these improvements, heart-related surgery was not widely accepted in the field of medical science until during World War II. Surgeons were forced to improve their methods of surgery in order to repair severe war wounds. Although they did not receive early recognition for their pioneering work, Dalton and Williams were later recognised for their roles in cardiac surgery. Honors Williams received honorary degrees from Howard and Wilberforce Universities, was named a charter member of the American College of Surgeons, and was a member of the Chicago Surgical Society. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was placed at U.S. Route 22 eastbound (Blair St., 300 block), Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, to commemorate his accomplishments and mark his boyhood home.

Food engineering includes, but is not limited to, the application of agricultural engineering, mechanical engineering and chemical engineering principles to food materials. Food engineers provide the technological knowledge transfer essential to the cost-effective production and commercialization of food products and services. Physics, chemistry, and mathematics are fundamental to understanding and engineering products and operations in the food industry. Food engineering encompasses a wide range of activities. Food engineers are employed in food processing, food machinery, packaging, ingredient manufacturing, instrumentation, and control. Firms that design and build food processing plants, consulting firms, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and health-care firms also employ food engineers. Specific food engineering activities include: * drug/food products; * design and installation of food/biological/pharmaceutical production processes; * design and operation of environmentally responsible waste treatment systems; * marketing and technical support for manufacturing plants. Topics In the development of food engineering, one of the many challenges is to employ modern tools, technology, and knowledge, such as computational materials science and nanotechnology, to develop new products and processes. Simultaneously, improving quality, safety, and security remain critical issues in food engineering study. New packaging materials and techniques are being developed to provide more protection to foods, and novel preservation technology is emerging. Additionally, process control and automation regularly appear among the top priorities identified in food engineering.

Its name derived from the Liao region, a historical name for southern Manchuria, from which the Liaoning province, Liaodong Peninsula and Liao dynasty also all have derived their names. The river is also popularly known as the \\"mother river\\" in Northeast China. Coursing long, the Liao River system drains a catchment basin of over , but its mean discharge is quite small at only about , about one-twentieth that of the Pearl River. The Liao River has an exceedingly high sediment load because many parts of it flow through powdery loess. The Liao River is also an important geographical landmark, as it divides the modern Liaoning province into two broad regions ‚Äî Liaodong (\\"east of Liao River\\") and Liaoxi (\\"west of Liao River\\"). Course The Liao River is formed from the confluence of its two main tributaries, the Xiliao River from the west, and Dongliao River from the east. The western tributary resides entirely in Inner Mongolia, and is formed by the confluence of the Xar Moron River and the Laoha River at approximately 43¬∞ 25' N, 120¬∞ 45' E, before being reinforced by another tributary called the Xinkai River at its lower section. The eastern tributary arises in western Jilin Province, and goes through an S-shaped course before meeting its counterpart near the junction region of Liaoning, Jilin and Inner Mongolia, approximately 42¬∞ 59' N, 123¬∞ 33' E. The resultant river, the Liao River proper, then enters Liaoning Province and courses southwards through the Northeast China Plain, receiving numerous tributaries along the way. It makes a westward turn near Pingdingbao Town, Tieling County, and after receiving more tributaries, earns an infrequently used nickname Juliu River (Â∑®ÊµÅÊ≤≥, \\"giant stream river\\"). The Liao River will then course southwest until it reaches near the Liujianfang Hydrological Station (ÂÖ≠Èó¥ÊàøÊ∞¥ÊñáÁ´ô) at Tai'an County, and historically bifurcates into two distributaries, forming the Liao River Delta (ËæΩÊ≤≥‰∏âËßíÊ¥≤). The western distributary of the delta, originally smaller, was called the Shuangtaizi River (ÂèåÂè∞Â≠êÊ≤≥) until 2011, receives the tributary Raoyang River at Panjin's Panshan County before draining into the Liaodong Bay of the Bohai Sea west of Dawa County. The eastern distributary, originally the larger and the main body of lower Liao River, was called the Wailiao River (Â§ñËæΩÊ≤≥, \\"Outer Liao River\\"). The Wailiao River travelled southwards to pick up two large tributaries, the Hun River and Taizi River, at a confluence locally referred as the \\"Trident River\\" (‰∏âÂ≤îÊ≤≥), where it then adopted the new name Daliao River (Â§ßËæΩÊ≤≥, \\"Great Liao River\\") and drained into the Liaodong Bay just west of Yingkou. However, the Liao River Delta has a flat topography made up of soft sediment soil, with meandrous waterways that had a rich history of rerouting. This coupled with the risk of storm surges due to the region's low elevation, created a huge problem in flood control. This flood risk at the coastal section of the Liao River system was particularly threatening to Yingkou, a city immediately adjacent to the mouth of Daliao River and home to 2 million people. In 1958, the upriver of the Wailiao River at Liujianfang was blocked off via a river engineering project, redirecting the water flow from the Liao River proper entirely towards the Shuangtaizi River (which was renamed to simply the \\"Liao River\\" in 2011), effectively separating the Hun River and Taizi River from the Liao River system. Therefore, the Daliao River system is considered an independent water system of their own since 1958, and the Hun and Taizi River are no longer tributaries of the Liao River. Also, due to the Wailiao River's upstream flow being cut off, the Liao River no longer has any distributaries, therefore the Liao River Delta technically also ceased to exist from 1958 onwards, however the term remains in use to describe the area of Panjin between the Liao River's left bank and Wailiao/Daliao River's right bank. Tributaries=Major tributaries *Xiliao River (, \\"Western Liao River\\"), historically also known as Huang River (ÊΩ¢Ê∞¥), is the largest tributary of Liao River, running and draining a basin of . The Xiliao River is formed by the confluence of Laoha River (ËÄÅÂìàÊ≤≥) flowing from the southwest, and Xar Moron River (Ë•øÊãâÊú®‰º¶Ê≤≥) flowing from the west, running its entire length eastwards within Inner Mongolia. It is joined at the lower course by a large tributary, the Xinkai River (Êñ∞ÂºÄÊ≤≥), which drains the southeast slopes of the Khingan Mountains and is dry in its upper reaches except after thunderstorms, north of the city of Shuangliao, before turning southeast to join the Dongliao River to form the Liao River proper near the common border of Liaoning, Jilin and Inner Mongolia. *Dongliao River (, \\"Eastern Liao River\\")Ôºåis the other major tributary of the Liao River, running , draining a basin of , and has a rich catchment of 88 tributaries, 23 of which are of significant sizes. Its headwaters arise in the low mountains near Dongliao County in Jilin Province, where more than 80% of its entire length resides. The Dongliao River then traverses a short west course through Liaoning Province, turns north back to Jilin before turning southwest to join the Xiliao River. Minor tributaries These following tributaries drain into the Liao River proper throughout its course within the Liaoning Province. *Sutai River () *Qing River () *Chai River () *Fan River () *Xiushui River () *Yangximu River () *Liu River () *Raoyang River () Former tributaries *Hun River (, \\"muddy river\\"), historically also known as Little Liao River (Â∞èËæΩÊ∞¥) or Shen River (Ê≤àÊ∞¥)Ôºåwas formally the second largest tributary of Liao River after Xiliao River. Running and draining a basin of , the Hun River has numerous tributaries of its own, 31 of which has catchment area greater than . It flows through the most populous area of Liaoning Province, including the provincial capital and largest city (also in the entire Northeast China), Shenyang, as well as the 10th largest city, Fushun. The river got its current name from the fast flow speed and high sediment load, which leads to its muddy appearance. The Hun River's headwaters arise from the Qian Mountains, a branch of the Changbai Mountains, where the river is also called Nalu River (Á∫≥ÂôúÊ∞¥) or Red River (Á∫¢Ê≤≥), and flows into the Dahuofang Reservoir (Â§ß‰ºôÊàøÊ∞¥Â∫ì), which supplies drinking water to the surrounding cities of Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Panjin, Yingkou and Dalian. The river's middle section was also called Shen River, which gave name to the capital city Shenyang to its north, and the lower section is also called Clam River (Ëõ§ËúäÊ≤≥). :Before 1958, the Hun River joins the Wailiao River and then the Taizi River near Haicheng ‚Äî the confluence of the three rivers was also known as \\"the Trident River\\" ‚Äî to form the Daliao River which drains into the Liaodong Bay. However in 1958, a river engineering project was conducted to address flood control problem in the coastal area near Yingkou. The upriver of the Wailiao River at Liujianfang was blocked off, diverting the Liao River stream away towards the Shuangtaizi River, effectively separating the Hun River and Taizi River from the main body of Liao River system. Therefore since 1958, the Hun and Taizi River were considered an independent river system of their own, no longer being tributaries of the Liao River. *Taizi River (, \\"crown prince river\\"), historically also known as Yan River (Ë°çÊ∞¥) or Liang River (Ê¢ÅÊ∞¥), was named according to the legend that it was the last site of refuge for Crown Prince Dan of Yan, who was fleeing from Qin conquest after the failed assassination attempt on the King of Qin. It was formally the third largest tributary of the Liao River, running and draining a basin of . The Taizi River, like the Hun River running parallel north of it, flows through some of the most important agricultural and industrial regions of southern Liaoning, including the cities of Benxi, Anshan and Liaoyang. Like its sister river, the Hun River, the Taizi River has numerous tributaries, including two largest ones of which it is formed from the confluence. Its headwaters arise from hill regions between Benxi and Fushun, and contains the famous Benxi Water Caves. Like Hun River, the Taizi River is no longer a tributary of Liao River since the obliteration of upstream Wailiao River in 1958.

Scholars hailed the brew as a cure for a variety of ailments; the nobility considered the consumption of good tea as a mark of their status, and the common people simply enjoyed its flavour. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known physical evidence of tea from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han (d. 141 BCE) in Xi'an was announced, indicating that tea from the genus Camellia was drunk by Han Dynasty emperors as early as the 2nd century BCE. Tea then became a popular drink in the Tang (618‚Äì907) and Song (960‚Äì1279) Dynasties. Rose tea of piety According to legend, tea was first discovered by the legendary Chinese emperor and herbalist, Shennong, in 2737 BCE. It is said that the emperor liked his drinking water boiled before he drank it so it would be clean, so that is what his servants did. One day, on a trip to a distant region, he and his army stopped to rest. A servant began boiling water for him to drink, and a dead leaf from the wild tea bush fell into the water. It turned a brownish color, but it was unnoticed and presented to the emperor anyway. The emperor drank it and found it very refreshing, and cha (tea) came into being. Lu Yu's statue in Xi'an.The Erya, a Chinese dictionary dated to the 3rd century BCE, records that an infusion of some kind of leaf was used as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE). While historically the origin of tea as a medicinal herb useful for staying awake is unclear, China is considered to have the earliest records of tea drinking, with recorded tea use in its history dating back to the first millennium BCE. The Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) used tea as medicine. The use of tea as a beverage drunk for pleasure on social occasions dates from the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) or earlier. The Classic of Tea („ÄäËå∂Á∂ì„Äã) by the Tang dynasty writer Lu Yu (Èô∏ÁæΩ)(729-804) is an early work on the subject. (See also Tea Classics) According to Cha Jing writing, around CE 760, tea drinking was widespread. The book describes how tea plants were grown, the leaves processed, and tea prepared as a beverage. It also describes how tea was evaluated. The book also discusses where the best tea leaves were produced. At this time in tea's history, the nature of the beverage and style of tea preparation were quite different from the way we experience tea today. Tea leaves were processed into compressed cakes form. The dried teacake, generally called brick tea was ground in a stone mortar. Hot water was added to the powdered teacake, or the powdered teacake was boiled in earthenware kettles then consumed as a hot beverage. A form of compressed tea referred to as white tea was being produced as far back as the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 CE). This special white tea of Tang was picked in early spring, when the tea bushes had abundant growths which resembled silver needles. These \\"first flushes\\" were used as the raw material to make the compressed tea. Tea is an important item in Chinese culture and is mentioned in the Seven necessities of (Chinese) daily life. Tea was also used as a relaxing therapy for the Chinese. In 1753, Linnaeus described the plant as a single species, Thea sinensis. Later, however, he recognized two species, Thea Bohea and Thea viridis, as cultivated in China, and it was long thought that these were the origin of black and green tea respectively. Roasting and brewing Tea roasting Steaming tea leaves was the primary process used for centuries in the preparation of tea. After the transition from compressed tea, the production of tea for trade and distribution changed once again. The Chinese learned to process tea in a different way in the mid-13th century. Fermentation After cutting, tea is subjected to a so-called \\"fermentation.\\" This process is not actually a fermentation, which is an anaerobic process, but rather an enzymatic oxidization of the polyphenols in the tea leaves, yielding theaflavins and thearubigins. When the tea leaves are dry, fermentation stops, allowing some control of the process by manipulation of the drying rate or adding water after drying. Fermentation can also be interrupted by heat, for example by steaming or dry-panning the tea leaves through a technique known as \\"shƒÅqƒ´ng\\" (ÊÆ∫Èùí) In 17th century China numerous advances were made in tea production. In the southern part of China, tea leaves were sun dried and then half fermented, producing Oolong or \\"black dragon tea.\\" However, this method was not common in the rest of China. Tea was used for medical purposes, and salt was often added to alter its bitter taste. Tea in mythology *Lu Yu wrote in the Classic of Tea or Cha Jing (Ëå∂Áªè), \\"Tea as a beverage originated with Shennong.\\" *The medicine book entitled Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Á•ûÂÜúÊú¨ËçâÁªè) stated that \\"Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs, he encountered seventy two poisons daily and used tea as an antidote\\" *In Chinese legend, Shennong died in Tea Hill (Chaling County), Hunan. Tasting tea Origins of the tea plant in China *In 760 CE, Lu Yu already noted: Tea is a grand tree from the South, tall from one, two, and up to several dozen Chi. Some with circumference up two meters (6.6 feet). *A. Wilson in his exploration of the south east area of China discovered tea bushes up to ten feet tall in mountains in Sichuan *In 1939, botanists discovered a 7.5 meter (24.6 feet) wild tea tree in Wuchuang county of Guizhou province. *In 1940, on the Old Eagle mountain of Wuchuang county, a 6.6 (21.7) meter tall wild tea tree was discovered. *In 1957, a 12-meter (39.4 feet) wild tea tree was discovered in Cheshui county of Guizhou. *In 1961, a one thousand seven hundred year old, thirty two meter (105 feet) tall and more than one meter (3.3 feet) wide wild tea tree was found in the rain forest of Yunnan. This is the king of tea trees. *In 1976, a 13-meter (42.3 feet) wild tea tree was found on Daozhen county, on a mountain at 1400 meter (4600 feet) elevation. *More wild tea trees were found in the mountains of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provincies, many of them more than ten meters tall. Etymology * Tea was called 'tu' (Ëçº) (in the Chinese ancient classic Shi Jing (The book of Songs)). * Tea was also called 'jia' (Ê™ü) in the ancient Chinese classic Er Ya compiled during the early Han Dynasty: \\" Jia is bitter tu\\". The word tu was further annotated by a Jin scholar, Guo Pu (276‚Äì324 CE): \\"Tu is a small plant, its leaves can be brewed into a beverage\\". * Tea was also called \\"She' (Ëîé) in a West Han monograph on dialect: Fang Yian. * During the Han Dynasty, the word tu took on a new pronunciation, 'cha', in addition to its old pronunciation 'tu'. The syllable 'tu' (Ëçº) later developed into 'te' in the Fujian dialect, and later 'tea', 'te'. The syllable 'she' (Ëîé) later became 'soh' in Jiangsu province, Suleiman's 'Sakh' also came from 'she'. The syllable \\"jia' (Ê™ü) later became 'cha' and 'chai' (Russia, India). During the Sui and Tang dynasties, drinking tea became a widespread custom, then spread west to Tibet. The first use of the word 'cha' instead of 'tu' for tea was in Lu Yu's Cha Jing, The Classic of Tea of 760 CE. Periods in the history of tea * From prehistoric time to Spring and Autumn period (221 BCE) Tea was used as sacrifice for ceremony * According to Chinese historical record, c. 1000 BCE, there were already tea farms in Sichuan and Yunnan * From end of Spring and Autumn period to early Western Han dynasty, Tea was used as vegetable food on table * From the historical annal \\"Yianzhi Chunchiu\\": the prime minister of Chi (547 BCE‚Äì490 BCE) had egg and tea food on his table. * Xia Zhong's Treatise on Food : \\"Since Jin dynasty, the people of Wu (now Suzhou city) cooked tea leaves as food, and called it tea broth\\". * From the beginning of Western Han to middle Western Han, Tu was used as medicine * From the late Western Han Dynasty to the Three Kingdoms Period, tea was imperial beverage * From the Western Jin dynasty to Sui dynasty, the use of tea as beverage spread in the Chinese population * From the Tang period onward, tea became one of the seven essentials of daily life * During the Southern Song Dynasty a Japanese monk ÊòéËè¥Ê†ÑË•ø Eisai (Yosai): came to Tiantai mountain of Zhejiang to study Chan (Zen) Buddhism (1168 CE); when he returned home in 1193 CE, he brought tea from China to Japan, planted it and wrote the first Japanese book on Tea:Âñ´Ëå∂È§äÁîüË®ò, Treatise on Drinking Tea for Health. This was the beginning of tea cultivation and tea culture in Japan * In the Song Dynasty, tea was a major export good, through the Silk Road on land and Silk Road on the sea, tea spread to Arab countries and Africa. * Some historians believe Marco Polo encountered tea in his travel. Other historians point out that his writings fail to mention tea at all. * In 1559, Giovanni ta Ramusio mentioned \\"chai\\" in \\"Delle Navigatione et Viaggi\\", Vol 6. * 1579, Two Russian travellers introduced Cha to Russia Mass production of white tea Modern-day white teas can be traced to the Qing Dynasty in 1796. Back then, teas were processed and distributed as loose tea that was to be steeped, and they were produced from \\"chaicha\\", a mixed- variety tea bush. They differed from other China green teas in that the white tea process did not incorporate de-enzyming by steaming or pan-firing, and the leaves were shaped. The silver needle white teas that were produced from the \\"chaicha\\" tea bushes were thin, small and did not have much silvery-white hair. It wasn't until 1885 that specific varietals of tea bushes were selected to make \\"Silver Needles\\" and other white teas. The large, fleshy buds of the \\"Big White\\", \\"Small White\\" and \\"Narcissus\\" tea bushes were selected to make white teas and are still used today as the raw material for the production of white tea. By 1891, the large, silvery-white down-covered Silver Needle was exported, and the production of White Peony started around 1922. The first tea monograph The first tea monograph Cha Jing by Tang dynasty writer Lu Yu was completed around 760 CE. This is more than four hundred years earlier than the first Japanese tea monograph by Eisai No known ancient Indian monograph on tea exists. There were about one hundred tea monographs from the Tang dynasty to Qing dynasty. This treasure about tea culture is only beginning to attract the interest of western scholars.

Filmed in Hamburg, Germany, and Italy, the film is about a workaholic chef who is forced to adjust to major changes in her personal and professional life that are beyond her control. The film won the Cr√©teil International Women's Film Festival Grand Prix Award, and was nominated for the Goya Award for Best European Film in 2002. It was also nominated for the German Film Awards Outstanding Feature Film. Plot Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is a chef at Lido, a gourmet restaurant in Hamburg, Germany. A perfectionist who lives only for her work, Martha has difficulty relating to the world other than through food. Her single-minded obsession with her culinary craft occasionally leads to unpleasant confrontations with customers. Consequently, the restaurant owner, Frida (Sibylle Canonica), requires her to see a therapist (August Zirner) to work out her poor interpersonal skills. Martha's therapy sessions, however, turn into monologues on food, and her approach to stress management usually involves briefly retreating to the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator. Martha's life takes a dramatic turn when she learns that her sister is killed in a car accident, leaving behind an eight-year-old daughter, Lina (Maxime Foerste). Martha must now look after her niece, who is understandably depressed, withdrawn, and refuses to eat. The girl's Italian father, Giuseppe Lorenzo, has been out of the picture for years living somewhere in Italy. While coping with her sister's death and raising the young girl, Martha's world is further complicated when Frida hires fun-loving and unorthodox Mario (Sergio Castellitto) as a sous-chef to replace Lea (Katja Studt), who is expecting a child any day. Martha looks on in horror as Mario transforms her kitchen of precision and logistics with his relaxed banter and eclectic jazz music. Unable to find an acceptable babysitter, Martha starts to bring Lina to the restaurant with her. Lina begins to emerge from her depression in the presence of Mario's playfulness, and even begins to eat when Mario leaves her unattended with a plate of spaghetti he's prepared. Touched by Mario's kindness and concern for the child, Martha becomes more accepting of Mario. She even asks for his help in locating Lina's father in Italy and translating a letter she's written to him. Just as Martha's strained relationship with Lina seems to be improving, she forgets to pick the girl up from school while helping Lea, her very-pregnant sous chef, get to the hospital to deliver her baby. Lina is angry at being forgotten at school, and the incident appears to cause a serious setback between her and Martha. To make amends, Martha offers to grant Lina any wish. For her wish, Lina wants Mario to cook for them. Mario agrees, and prepares a picnic-style dinner in Martha's living room. Despite the mess left behind in the kitchen, the evening of stories and games brings the three closer together. The renewed warmth between Martha and Lina is immediately tested when Martha is told by the school principal that Lina has not been attending school regularly, and that when she does come to school, she falls asleep. He also tells Martha that when he asked the girl why she was always so tired, she told him that she was forced to work in a kitchen for her room and board. Angered by Lina's behavior, and also having been warned by the restaurant owner, Martha tells her she can no longer come to the restaurant. Lina storms off, nearly getting hit by a car, and later attempts to run away to Italy. Mario continues to support Martha emotionally, and their relationship becomes romantic. Lina's father, in answer to Martha's letter, finally arrives and takes his daughter to Italy to live with his new wife and family. Distraught and conflicted by the separation, Martha rejects Mario's loving support, and after another confrontation with a customer, she quits her job. Soon after, Martha asks Mario to accompany her to Italy to retrieve Lina. After reuniting with the girl, Martha and Mario get married, and the three begin their lives together as a loving family.

The focus of the research at this company is the environment, biodiversity, and sustainability. History Manaaki Whenua was originally part of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), but was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were created in 1992. As part of that process, it was semi-commercialised, and now operates as a government-owned company rather than as a government department. The commercialisation has led to greater emphasis on financial viability, and Manaaki Whenua is employed by various private groups to provide advice and information. It is currently chaired by Jane Taylor.Landcare Research Retrieved 27 October 2016. Locations The main site is in Lincoln, near Christchurch. There are also other sites at Auckland on the Tamaki campus of Auckland University, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Alexandra, and Dunedin. Collections Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research holds several collections of organisms that are of significant national importance to New Zealand. Detailed information on all the specimens can be found though the Systematics Collections Data (SCD) website. International collection of microorganisms from plants The International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants in Auckland holds live bacterial and fungal specimens that are preserved under liquid nitrogen or in freeze dried ampoules. Currently there are over 20,000 specimens in the collection. New Zealand Fungarium (PDD) The Auckland office also has the New Zealand Fungarium (PDD), a fungarium containing over 80,000 dried fungal specimens, including all the New Zealand fungal type species. This represents one of the most extensive compilations on the national fungal biota of any country. New Zealand Arthropod Collection The New Zealand Arthropod Collection (NZAC) or Ko te Aitanga Pepeke O Aotearoa in MƒÅori. The NZAC has over 6 million specimens (1 million pinned and 5 million preserved in fluid) and has the most complete coverage of terrestrial invertebrates of all the collections held in New Zealand. In addition to its fundamental value to the science of taxonomy and systematics, the collection underpins quarantine and border control decisions (e.g., verifying the presence or absence of species in New Zealand); and contributes to listings of threatened insect species. The NZAC is held at Landcare Research's Tamaki site. National Nematode Collection of New Zealand The National Nematode Collection of New Zealand (NNCNZ) contains thousands of nematode specimens. It is contained within the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Allan Herbarium The Allan Herbarium (CHR) at Lincoln, contains species from around the world but specialises in plants (indigenous and exotic) of the New Zealand region and the Pacific. It also has specialist collections of seed, fruit, wood, plant leaf cuticle, liquid- preserved specimens, and microscope slides. The oldest samples are the 91 duplicate specimens collected by Banks and Solander during Captain Cook's first voyage to New Zealand in 1769‚Äì1770. There are currently over 550,000 specimens in the Allan Herbarium with 5,000‚Äì8,000 being added annually. Two- thirds of the specimens are of indigenous plants with the remainder divided between naturalised, cultivated, and foreign specimens. It was named for Harry Allan , to acknowledge his contributions to New Zealand botany. National New Zealand Flax Collection Manaaki Whenua is kaitiaki of an ethnobotanical collection of traditional weaving varieties of harakeke (NZ flax, Phormium spp.) donated by Rene Orchiston of Gisborne. The 50 harakeke were selected long ago from natural stands and cultivated by MƒÅori weavers for their special leaf and fibre properties. There are varieties specially suited to making kete, whariki, piupiu and cloaks. Research Science includes research into the processes that maintain New Zealand's ecosystems, enable natural flora, fauna and fungi to flourish, and protect soil and catchments for a range of production and other purposes. The impacts of disruption to ecosystems; biosecurity risks from foreign weeds, pests and micro-organisms; and contamination to land, water and air caused by the production of natural, manufactured or waste compounds are investigated. Research is also undertaken to develop tools to help mitigate inefficient resource use and excess waste, and systems designed to improve resource use productivity, lifestyle and business viability. Research focuses on six key areas: Base camp for the 2005 Auckland BioBlitz Dr Peter Buchanan, organiser of the Auckland 2004 and 2005 BioBlitzes * Conserving and restoring our biodiversity and the healthy resilience of natural ecosystems * Reducing pest, disease and weed impacts in our natural and managed ecosystems * Understanding, mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change * Sustaining the long-term health of soils, waterways and landscapes for the continued viability of our rural environments * Enhancing urban biodiversity and developing low-impact approaches for built environments * Fostering environmentally sustainable and globally competitive business practices BioBlitz Manaaki Whenua has organised several BioBlitz events ‚Äì a survey of all species in a given area. The first New Zealand BioBlitz was held in the Auckland suburb of St Heliers on 30 April ‚Äì 1 May 2004; in a remnant of native forest at Dingle Dell reserve, 925 separate species were found, and 631 species were found in a native bush gully at Meadowbank Primary School. A second BioBlitz in the Auckland Domain on 12‚Äì13 March 2005 found 1575 distinct species. Another BioBlitz occurred at Hagley Park in Christchurch on 8‚Äì9 April; here 1197 species were found.

The film is Wang's second feature and sees him reuniting with actress Yu Nan. Jingzhe is also known by its original international title, The Story of Ermei. Jingzhe tells the story of Ermei (played by Yu Nan), a young villager in rural China. When Ermei's family falls on hard financial times, she is forced to marry off to an alcoholic villager so her family can collect the bride price. Unhappy in her married life, Ermei runs away to the city where she finds a work at a restaurant. She has an affair with a man named Qiao but soon returns to her drunkard husband, where an emergency forces her to take initiative in her relationship. Jingzhe was screened in several international film festivals throughout 2004, including the high profile Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2004, where it was part of the \\"Panorama\\" program.  Title  The title of the film, Jingzhe (), is one of the twenty-four periods of the ancient Chinese Calendar. In particular, \\"Jingzhe\\" refers to the third solar term, which falls on March 5‚Äì6 and marks the start of spring. The English title used for international audiences, originally Story of Ermei, was eventually abandoned in favor of the pinyin transcription of the original title, Jingzhe.  Plot  When Guan Ermei's (Yu Nan) grandfather falls terminally ill, her poor farming family is forced into a crisis. Selling their pigs in order to purchase cedar in order to make a casket, they discover that the money from the sale is insufficient to purchase the wood. Guan Ermei's father therefore attempts to illegally cut down a cedar tree when he is caught and fined. Even further in debt, the family arranges to sell Ermei to Zhang Suo, a drunken but wealthy peasant. Ermei, disgusted with her future husband, flees to the city and seeks out her friend Maonu (Shi Xiaoxia). Maonu sets Ermei with a job in a restaurant run by Yu, and also introduces her to a young man, Qian Liansheng. Soon, Ermei and Liansheng have fallen in love, although Liansheng remains unfaithful to Ermei. Ermei eventually returns home and marries Zhang Suo, bearing him a child. When her son falls ill, Ermei takes the family back to the city to see a doctor and her friend Maonu. Maonu, however, has moved to the south. Enamored with the idea of seeing the sea, the family returns home after Ermei's son has recovered. At first despondent, Ermei discovers the joy of simply playing with her son.

The daughter of a bootmaker in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, she met and married Israel Grodner some time around 1870, when he passed through Kremenchuk in the course of his wanderings as a young Broder singer. Her husband was recruited by Abraham Goldfaden as the first professional Yiddish-language stage actor, but initially Yiddish theater was an entirely male affair. The gender barrier was broken by the teenaged Sara Segal, later famous under the name Sophie Karp. However, Annetta Grodner was the first to play prima donna roles.

(February 27, 1834 ‚Äì January 10, 1910) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who became an important president of Georgetown University, resulting in his being known as its \\"second founder.\\" The university's flagship building, Healy Hall, bears his name. Though readily passing as white and self-identifying as such, Healy would be posthumously recognized as the first black American to earn a Ph.D., to become a Jesuit, and to become the president of a predominantly white university. Born in Georgia, Healy was legally a slave by birth, as his mother was one-eighth black and his father was a white Irish immigrant, who, in the eyes of the law, owned his wife and children as slaves. Desiring to remove him from such conditions, Healy's father sent him north to be educated, first in New York and then at the College of the Holy Cross. Born into a family that produced many Catholic leaders, Healy decided to become a priest and entered the Society of Jesus. After his initial studies and teaching, he was sent to Europe to continue his higher education. In 1864, he received his doctorate in philosophy from the Catholic University of Louvain, and returned to Georgetown University to become the chair of philosophy. Healy was promoted to prefect, and in 1874, was made the president of Georgetown University. While his fellow Jesuits were aware of his mixed race, he was widely regarded by the public as white. Healy's tenure would encompass a period of significant growth and reform of the university. Seeking to transform the institution into a modern university, Healy broadened the curriculum to more fully incorporate the sciences. He also raised the standards of the School of Medicine, and oversaw rapid growth of the Law School. Healy's most visible contribution to Georgetown was the construction of a grand, new building that would later become known as Healy Hall. While the building was largely completed by the end of his tenure, the project left the university in tremendous debt. Experiencing declining health, Healy resigned the presidency in 1882, and went to live in Maine with his brother, James, the Bishop of Portland. The two traveled extensively throughout Europe. Afterwards, Healy returned to perform pastoral work in Rhode Island and New York City, before once again moving to Georgetown, where he died.  Early life  Patrick Francis Healy was born on February 27, 1834, in a log cabin in Macon, Georgia. Patrick's father, Michael Morris Healy, had emigrated from Ireland to the United States, through Canada, in 1818. On land that he won in the Georgia Land Lotteries, he established a cotton plantation on the banks of the Ocmulgee River and owned 50 slaves at the time of his death. One of those was Patrick's mother, Mary Eliza Smith, who Michael Healy purchased. Eliza was one-eighth black, known as an octoroon, making her children one-sixteenth black. One of her parents had fled Haiti for the United States in the 1790s, during the Haitian Revolution. As interracial marriage was prohibited by Georgia's anti-miscegenation law, Michael formed a common-law marriage with the 16-year-old Eliza in 1829. While the Catholic Church did recognize interracial marriages, there were no priests in Macon County at that time to officiate. Their marriage was unusual among interracial marriages in the South at the time in that neither had ever married anyone else, and after marriage, they lived with each other faithfully for the rest of their lives until both of their deaths in 1850. Patrick was the third of ten siblings, eight of whom would survive into adulthood. His three sisters would go on to become nuns, while two of his brothers would also become Catholic priests; one of them, James Augustine Healy, would become the Bishop of Portland, and the first black Catholic bishop in the United States. Patrick and all of his siblings were born as slaves, as by the doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem, they inherited the legal status of their mother. Michael Healy was prevented by Georgia law from manumitting his wife or children, which was allowed only in exceptional circumstances, by an act of the Georgia General Assembly.  Education  alt=Portrait of Healy from the waist up As slaves under the law, the Healy children were prohibited from attending school. Wishing to remove his children from their conditions of slavery in Georgia, Michael Healy sent all of his children to be educated in the North. At the time of his death in August 1850, he also intended to join them in the north. Healy was at first unable to find a school in the north that would accept his children. However, he eventually found a Quaker school in Flushing, New York (now a neighborhood of Queens), called the Flushing Quaker Academy, that allowed the three oldest sons to enroll. Like three of his brothers, Patrick Healy continued his education at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. He graduated in 1850, at the age of 16, and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts by Georgetown University, as Holy Cross had not yet been chartered and conferred degrees under Georgetown's charter. After graduating, Healy entered the Society of Jesus on September 17, 1850, at the novitiate in Frederick, Maryland. While he worried that his mixed race would present an obstacle to his entrance into the Jesuit order, this proved less of a concern than the fact because Healy's parents were never legally married in the eyes of the church, he was born out of wedlock. While under canon law, Healy required a dispensation to join the order, none was ever sought and he was admitted without issue. With his admission to the Society of Jesus, he became the first black American Jesuit. After two years of study, Healy professed his first vows, and was sent to teach at Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia. The following year, he was transferred to Holy Cross. While teaching there, he found that some students who knew his brothers learned of his racial background and made disparaging comments about him in secret. In 1858, Healy went to Georgetown University, where he taught philosophy and theology. The Jesuit superiors at Georgetown were impressed by his skill in philosophy, and decided to send him to Europe, where he continued his study of philosophy and theology. He first went to Rome, but during the winter, his health declined, and he was sent to Belgium to continue his studies at the Catholic University of Louvain. While there, he was ordained a priest on September 3, 1864. He also became fluent in Latin, French, Italian, and German. On July 26, 1865, he received a Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy, making him the first black American ever to earn a Ph.D.  Racial identity  Throughout his life, Healy's race was the subject of varying degrees of speculation. The Healy brothers considered themselves white, rather than black. Of them all, Patrick Healy most readily passed as white. Indeed, his passport described his complexion as \\"light,\\" suggesting he passed as a light-skinned white man, rather than a light-skinned black man. Though he himself identified as white, knowledge of his mixed race background would not be a secret while he served as president of Georgetown University. His fellow Jesuits knew of his mixed race, but it is unlikely that this was widely known outside of Jesuit circles. Despite his appearance and self-identity, speculation as to his race remained with him. Orestes Brownson, who knew the Healy family personally, alluded to the Healy brothers who became priests as belonging to the category of \\"men with large admixture of negro blood, born of slave mothers,\\" while decrying racism in the United States in an 1862 article. Likewise, while in school, Patrick Healy faced rumors among classmates that his white but slightly dark complexion was due to the presence of some \\"Spanish blood.\\" Of the three priests, only one, Alexander Sherwood Healy, appeared as black. Though Healy's racial background was not widely known during his lifetime, there was a resurgent interest in his history in the mid-20th century. In the 1960s and 1970s, Georgetown University began publicly identifying Healy as black.  Georgetown University  In 1866, Healy returned to Maryland, and was appointed the chair of philosophy at Georgetown University. After two years, he became the prefect of schools. The following year, he professed his final vows. On May 23, 1873, he also became the vice rector of the university. As the president, John Early's, health began to fail, Healy increased assumed the duties of the presidency. He initiated a reorganization of classes, established an alumni society, and created three graduation medals: the Merrick Debating Medal, the Morris Historical Medal, and the Tower Scientific Medal. He also discontinued the monastic practice of have one student read aloud in the refectory during meals. He also expressed his desire that a grand new building be constructed to connect Old North and the Maguire Building. As early as 1869, there was talk of naming Healy to succeeded Early's predecessor, Bernard A. Maguire. The provincial superior, Joseph Keller, had described Healy as the most qualified candidate, but the superiors in Rome, decided on Early due to Healy's race. When Early's health began to deteriorate, Keller proposed to the superiors in Rome that John Bapst succeed him, while Healy would replace Bapst as the president of Boston College, believing that his race would be less of an issue at the New England school. Rome rejected this arrangement, deciding that Bapst should remain in Boston.  Presidency  alt=East elevation of Healy Hall On May 23, 1873, Early died suddenly, and Keller made Healy the acting rector. The following day, the board of directors took the further step of electing him the acting president of Georgetown University. However, his appointment as rector by the Jesuit Superior General, which ordinarily was done around the same time as the selection of a new president, did not come until a year later. The delay was the result of concern in Rome over Healy's mixed race background. On July 31, 1874, he was officially inaugurated as president and rector of the university. As such, he became the first black president of a predominantly white university in the United States. In a very unusual arrangement, he continued to hold the role of prefect until 1879, simultaneously with the office of president. In the year following his inauguration as president, Healy articulated his vision of transforming Georgetown into a true \\"university\\" to the Superior General, Peter Jan Beckx. While Georgetown already fit the contemporary American definition of a university‚Äîa collection of degree- granting schools under one administration‚ÄîHealy sought to remake Georgetown in the newly emerging notion of a university‚Äîan institution where a person could learn in any of a wide array of increasingly specialized academic fields. In this way, he sought to make Georgetown into what the nation's bishops, gathered in 1866 at the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, had envisioned: a great Catholic university in the United States that engaged in scholarship in every religious and secular subject. The demographics of the student body underwent change during Healy's tenure, with Northerners outnumbering Southerners for the first time. Meanwhile, the percentage of students who were Catholic increased to more than 80%, due in part to a growing Irish American middle class in the North that was able to send its sons to Georgetown. Meanwhile, Healy created the first formal scholarship program that paid the tuition of one student from each of Washington's parishes. He also reformed the university's approach to student discipline, bringing it ore closely in line with other contemporary American universities; rather than the university acting in loco parentis, it would treat students as being on the cusp of adulthood. Throughout his presidency, Healy experienced poor health, likely suffering from untreated epilepsy. In 1881, he went to live with his brother, James, in Maine to recover his health. Returning to Georgetown in February 1882, his condition quickly worsened and he resigned the presidency on February 16, being succeeded by James A. Doonan. = Curricular reform = alt=Bust portrait of Patrick Francis Healy Healy continued the reform of the curriculum he began as prefect by increasing the breadth of courses offered, and, by 1879, allowing students to study the classical liberal arts curriculum or a new \\"commercial and scientific\\" one. Graduates of this new scientific curriculum received a Bachelor of Science degree. Healy recruited new Jesuit faculty with higher academic credentials to support this curricular improvement. Despite the new emphasis on science, Healy revitalized the university's commitment to rhetoric. In 1875, he established the Merrick Debate, hosted by the Philodemic Society, following a donation by alumnus Richard T. Merrick. He also gave the Society a privileged place among student groups by setting aside its own room in Healy Hall. In addition to reforming undergraduate science education, Healy sought to bring the School of Medicine up to rigorous, modern medical standards. While the school had previously operated almost entirely autonomously of the rest of the university, Healy dissolved its governing board, bringing the school under his direct control, and replaced the entire faculty (with only the founding faculty remaining as professors emeriti). The length of the curriculum was lengthened from two to three years, which now included clinic education. An entrance exam was given for the first time to applicants. During Healy's presidency, the Law School saw significant growth, driven in large part by the District of Columbia Bar's decision to require new applicants to the bar to have completed three years of formal legal education. In the early 1880s, the school relocated twice within Downtown Washington, but was financially unable to move to the university's Georgetown campus as it desired. = Constructing Healy Hall = Healy determined that Georgetown's most pressing need was to expand its physical facilities. He and Keller entertained the possibility of relocating to a new, nearby campus north of New Cut Road (today known as Reservoir Road), or moving the university out of Washington entirely. However, the cost of both of these proposals was prohibitive, and they decided instead to improve the existing campus. Replacing plans for the construction of several smaller buildings, Healy undertook to construct the grand building that he envisioned as prefect in an embellished architectural style that contrasted with the city's simple Federal architecture. alt=Drawing of Healy Hall In 1874, Healy commissioned architects John L. Smithmeyer and Paul J. Pelz to design what would later become known as Healy Hall, Georgetown's flagship building. The building would rise five stories, topped by a clock tower, and incorporate elements from a variety of architectural styles into a primarily Romanesque facade, evoking the ancient universities of Europe. It would house classrooms, offices, an auditorium (later known as Gaston Hall), laboratories, a library, and students dormitories. Groundbreaking occurred in 1877, after obtaining the reluctant approval of the provincial superior, who was wary of the cost of constructing one large, ornate building and authorized $100,000 to be spent, equivalent to $ in . By far the largest project Georgetown had ever undertaken, construction of the building required the university, which was already suffering from the Panic of 1873, to finance the entire project on debt. In order to sustain the project, in 1880, Healy re-established Georgetown's alumni association, which had gone defunct four years earlier. He also solicited William Wilson Corcoran, the university's oldest living alumnus, to become president of the association and to raise funds. Despite the creation of the alumni association and a donation by Corcoran, after several years, only a small fraction of the $100,000 was raised. Therefore, from 1878 to 1880, Healy left the university to travel the country to raise funds. In 1878, he sailed to San Francisco, California by way of the Isthmus of Panama, with the president of the College of the Holy Cross, Joseph B. O'Hagan. Though also to engage in fundraising, this voyage was primarily intended to improve Healy's declining health. The following year, he returned by land, crossing the Midwest to New York City and down the East Coast. Despite his extensive efforts, Healy was only able to raise $60,000. Meanwhile, as construction on the building progressed, so did costs. In November 1879, the building's exterior was complete, at a cost of more than $150,000. After a halt in construction, work began on the interior in 1880, requiring additional, large loans to be taken out. The building was put to regular use in 1881, and by the following year, almost $440,000 had been expended on the project, equivalent to $ in . Facing a dire financial situation, the university laid off staff, including all its lay faculty, and began leasing and selling properties it owned in Washington, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  Later years  After leaving Georgetown, Healy returned to Portland, Maine, to live with his brother. With James, he traveled extensively throughout Europe, visiting major Catholic institutions in France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium. Despite his travels, for the remainder of his life, his health would never recover. After some time, he went to Providence, Rhode Island, where he performed limited pastoral work. He returned to New York City, where he was assigned to the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola. Several years later, he moved back to Georgetown University to live out his final years. Healy died at Georgetown on January 10, 1910. His funeral was held in Dahlgren Chapel, and his body was interred in the Jesuit Community Cemetery on the university's campus. By the time of his death, Healy was frequently referred to as the \\"second founder\\" of Georgetown, for presiding over a period of unprecedented growth in the university's history. In 1969, the Georgetown University Alumni Association created the Patrick Healy Award, which is presented annually to an individual who is not an alumnus of the university but has contributed to it and upheld its ideals and traditions.

Honey bees are one of but a few kinds of insects that survive the winter as a colony. As the outside air temperature decreases the winter cluster becomes tighter and more compact. The bees cling tightly together on the combs in the hive. The temperature within the winter cluster remains remarkably warm regardless of the outside air temperature.

Tosa school paintings are characterised by \\"areas of flat opaque colour enclosed by simple outlines, where drawing is precise and conventional\\", with many narrative subjects from Japanese literature and history. However, by the 17th century both Tosa and Kan≈ç artists broadened their range, and the distinction between these and other schools became less clear.Watson, pp. 38‚Äì39, 38 quoted; Paine & Soper, p. 202 The origins of this school of painting can be traced to (fl. first half 15th century), Encyclopedia of World Art\\"\\", pp. 1032‚Äì3 who first used the professional name of Tosa, though unverified claims to earlier origins were made later by Mitsunobu (1434?‚Äì?1525) who formally founded the school. Mitsunobu served as the official painter (edokoro-azukari) at the imperial court, specializing in courtly subjects painted in the yamato-e („ÇÑ„Åæ„Å®Áµµ) style. The Tosa school under Mitsunobu retained the position of () for three generations, until 1569, and regained the post 1634 under Mitsunori (See #History below). Until the 17th century, the Tosa school painted for the court and aristocratic patrons, which favored such painting subjects as scenes from the classic Tale of Genji (Ê∫êÊ∞èÁµµ), but in later years, the school's range expanded to include bird-and-flower painting and other Chinese-inspired themes and styles. In general, the Tosa style is characterized by rather flat, decorative compositions, fine linework, great attention to detail, and brilliant color. History It is starting with Tosa Mitsunobu that a definite art school (atelier, workshop) and family line can be established. But Mitsunobu purports that the origins of the school can be traced back further to who held the post of in 1355‚Äì1371. Encyclopedia of World Art\\"\\", pp.1032‚Äì1033> The earliest documentary evidence for an artist using the name Tosa are two early 15th-century references to a man named Fujiwara Yukihiro (Ëó§Âéü Ë°åÂ∫É) (fl. 1406‚Äì1434) who was also known as Tosa Sh≈çgen (Âúü‰Ωê Â∞ÜÁõ£), a title derived from his position as governor of Tosa Province. Yukihiro's activity as a painter is known primarily from an inscription on illustrated handscrolls of the Stories of the Origin of Y≈´z≈´ Nembutsu (ËûçÈÄöÂøµ‰ªèÁ∏ÅËµ∑); 1414, Seiry≈çji (Ê∏ÖÊ∂ºÂØ∫), Kyoto. A bloodline descent from Yukimitsu to Mitsunobu (father-son?) is speculated, but the family document lacks records covering that period. Mitsunobu's daughter married Kan≈ç Motonobu, head of the Kan≈ç school, which increased the tendency of Kan≈ç artists, already using two distinct styles, to work in a Tosa style when occasion demanded.Paine & Soper, p. 180 The surviving paintings that can be attributed to Mitsunobu show less quality than his reputation in historical sources would suggest,Paine & Soper, p. 182 but many fine works remain from Mitsunobu's hand. Although he painted both Buddhist paintings and portraits in addition to the standard repertoire of courtly themes, he is best known for his illustrated handscrolls, emaki (ÁµµÂ∑ª), such as The Legends of Kiyomizu-dera (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ÂØ∫Á∏ÅËµ∑). Illustration of the Genji Monogatari ch.42 ‚Äì ÂåÇÂÆÆ Ni≈ç no Miya (\\"The Perfumed Prince\\") Credited to Tosa Mitsuoki (1617‚Äì1691). The Tosa school's art tradition was passed from Mitsunobu to (1496 ‚Äì ) under whom the fortunes of the school began to decline, then to , but Mitsumochi perished in battle in 1569 causing the family to lose their position as head of the painting bureau (edokoro- azukari). The headship of the school passed to (1539‚Äì1613), whose relationship with his predecessors is uncertain. Mitsuyoshi eventually left the capital and his post and settled in the city of Sakai (Â†∫), a port city near Osaka, where he sold paintings to the local townspeople. Mitsumochi also moved away from the traditional Tosa themes to specialize in bird-and-flower paintings. During this period, the stewardship of the imperial painting bureau passed from the Tosa school into the hands of Kan≈ç school painters. Mitsuyoshi's son, Mitsunori (ÂÖâÂâá) (1583‚Äì1638) continued to live and work in Sakai, painting for townsmen, until 1634, p.210 when he moved to the capital with his eldest son, Mitsuoki (ÂÖâËµ∑) (1617‚Äì1691) at the invitation of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, where Mitsunori began painting ceremonial fans for the court. Twenty years later, in 1654, Mitsuoki won back the position of edokoro-azukari for the family, which enabled him to revive the school. Mitsuoki rejuvenated the traditional Tosa style by introducing elements from Chinese painting. He is particularly noted for his elegant paintings of quail, as for example, the Chrysanthemum and Quail screens which he painted with the help of his son Mitsunari (ÂÖâÊàê) (1646‚Äì1710).Paine & Soper, pp. 210‚Äì211 Mitsuoki's successors headed the Imperial painting bureau until the end of the Edo period, but their reliance on imitating the style of Mitsuoki, rather than developing new techniques or themes, led to the production of works that were increasingly static and conventional. However, Mitsusada (1738‚Äì1806), a dedicated practitioner of the Tosa traditions, managed to effect a temporary Tosa revival. British Museum, \\"Tosa Mitsusada, Quails and Wheat, a hanging scroll painting\\". Retrieved on 13 December 2013. Artists of the school but not the family were more significant, notably Sumiyoshi Jokei (1599‚Äì1670), a pupil of Mitsuyoshi, and his son Gukei Sumiyoshi (1631‚Äì1705), whose work revitalized the original tradition of small narrative scrolls with emphasis on details of everyday life. Reviving interest in Japanese history in the 18th and 19th centuries kept demand for Tosa style work alive, but the style of the school, with its thin line and reliance on detail was less suited to the larger hanging-scrolls that were now the format preferred by patrons. The interest in painting everyday life of the Tosa school was influential on the ukiyo-e school of paintings and prints, especially on the aristocratic painter Iwasa Matabei (1578‚Äì1650), who is regarded as one of the founders of ukiyo-e.

History Dispensing with second guitarist Danny Kalb, Ochs performs alone on twelve original songs, an interpretation of Alfred Noyes' \\"The Highwayman\\" set to music (much as Poe's \\"The Bells\\" had been set to music on the previous album) and a cover of Ewan MacColl's \\"The Ballad of the Carpenter\\". Of the twelve originals, probably the most noted was the title track, with its distinctive trilling guitar part, that spoke of a soldier sick of fighting. Also of note was the album closer, \\"Here's to the State of Mississippi\\", a biting criticism of that state's lack of civil rights and general bigoted attitude. Other important songs include \\"Draft Dodger Rag\\" (assailing those \\"red blooded Americans\\" who were in favor of US participation in the Vietnam War but did not fight because they were just summertime soldiers and sunshine patriots), \\"That Was The President\\" (a tribute to John F. Kennedy written soon after his assassination), \\"Talking Birmingham Jam\\" (which used the traditional talking blues form to assail the racist leaders of Birmingham) and \\"Links on the Chain\\" (attacking labor unions for excluding African-Americans and failing to support civil rights). Ochs showed great thematic versatility on the album, including not just blatantly anti-war or protest songs but also poetry (Alfred Noyes, John Rooney, and Ewan MacColl) and songs less in lock-step with the contemporary American radical left. He noted, for instance, in the liner notes that his Marxist friends couldn't understand why he wrote \\"That Was the President,\\" dryly adding that that was one of the reasons he wasn't a Marxist. However, Ochs backed away from the song's hero worship of John F. Kennedy by explaining that \\"after the assassination, Fidel Castro aptly pointed out that only fools could rejoice at such a tragedy, for systems, not men are the enemy.\\" Ochs showed more socialist sympathies with the songs \\"The Men Behind the Guns\\" and \\"Ballad of the Carpenter,\\" with its memorable lyric \\"Jesus was a working man.\\" (Ochs wrote in the liner notes that \\"songs like this\\" were one of the reasons the State Department blocked Ewan MacColl from entering the U.S., adding that this was unwise given \\"the quality of culture in America.\\") However, more doctrinaire socialists may have had mixed feelings about \\"That's What I Want to Hear,\\" in which Ochs tells an out of work man to stop begging and fight for full employment. Among more traditional protest songs, the most pointed might be \\"Iron Lady,\\" about the death penalty, with the memorable line \\"And a rich man never died upon the chair.\\" (The \\"iron lady\\" in the title referred to the electric chair.) Ochs wrote that \\"in the future, intelligent men will read in amazement about the murder of Caryl Chessman.\\" But hard hitting songs like that and the title song were softened with sentimental and even romantic songs like \\"That Was the President\\" and Noyes' \\"The Highway Man.\\" And while critical, songs like \\"Draft Dodger Rag\\" and \\"Talking Birmingham Jam\\" used humor rather than harsh rhetoric to make their points. Commenting on \\"Draft Dodger Rag,\\" Ochs compared the Viet Cong soldier who screamed his hatred of Americans while being shot by a firing squad, to his American counterpart who stayed \\"up nights thinking of ways to\\" escape the army. On the 2001 CD reissue, an alternative electric version of \\"I Ain't Marching Anymore\\" follows \\"Here's to the State of Mississippi\\". Released as the A-side of a British 45, it had previously appeared in the United States on the 1976 compilation Chords of Fame and the 1997 box set Farewells & Fantasies, both out-of-print.

Atom Smasher is known for his power of growth and super strength. Atom Smasher made his first live action appearance on the second season of The Flash played by Adam Copeland. The character will make his cinematic debut in 2021's Black Adam portrayed by Noah Centineo set in the DC Extended Universe. Publication history Created by Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway, he first appeared in All-Star Squadron #25 (September 1983). Thomas chose his name as a tribute to his friend and fellow comic book fan Allan Rothstein. Fictional character biography=Origin The godson of Al Pratt, the Golden Age Atom, Albert Rothstein acquired his metahuman powers of super strength and control over his molecular structure, allowing him to alter the size and density of his body, from his grandfather, a reluctant supervillain known as Cyclotron. This allowed him to fight crime first as Nuklon, and then, later, as Atom Smasher. As Nuklon, Albert was a charter member of Infinity, Inc. and subsequently served in the Justice League. He was considered a dependable, but rather insecure and indecisive superhero while in Infinity, Inc. During this time he had a mohawk haircut. While in the JLA, he forged a strong friendship with fellow former Infinity Inc. teammate Obsidian. The Justice Society Atom Smasher about to crush Kobra. Albert finally gets his dream and is invited to join the reunited JSA under his new name and identity, Atom Smasher (he mocks his old mohawk and costume in the meantime). For years, Atom Smasher cherishes his role in upholding Pratt's legacy and constantly seeks to prove himself worthy to his Golden Age idols - especially when many of them became his teammates in the JSA. He looks up to the elder JSA members, but is himself looked up to by young rookie member Stargirl. When Albert's mother is murdered in a plane crash engineered by the terrorist Kobra, he becomes consumed by vengeance, nearly crushing Kobra in his hands before he is talked down by his teammate Jack Knight, who convinces him that he should not taint the memory of his mother by associating it with Kobra's murder. Not long after the fatal crash, Albert - with the aid of Metron of the New Gods - goes back in time and replaces his mother with the weakened villain Extant. This ends up saving her life but makes Albert a murderer, even if there was no other way to contain Extant and to stop him from causing further harm. Black Adam When Captain Marvel's longtime adversary Black Adam reforms and joins the JSA, he and Rothstein develop a rivalry at first as Al refuses to believe Adam has reformed. This soon turns to kinship after Adam justifies Al's murderous actions towards Extant. Indeed, Black Adam comments that he thinks of Atom Smasher as the brother he never had. Encouraged by Adam, Atom Smasher grows frustrated with the JSA's moral boundaries, especially when Kobra blackmails authorities into granting his release. Albert and Adam promptly quit the JSA after Kobra's escape. Shortly thereafter, the unlikely duo settle each other's personal scores. Adam kills Kobra, while Rothstein kills the dictatorial president of Khandaq, Adam's home country. Atom Smasher helps lead a team of rogue metahumans (including former Infinity Inc. teammates Brainwave and Northwind) in an invasion of Khandaq and overthrow its oppressive regime. Atom Smasher initially fights against his JSA teammates in Khandaq before deciding instead to help forge an uneasy truce‚ÄîBlack Adam and his compatriots can remain in power so long as they never leave the country. Atom Smasher remains in the Middle Eastern nation for a time, although he eventually begins to question Adam's motives. Rothstein perishes in JSA #75 while fighting against the Spectre, but is revived by Black Adam's lightning, and carried back to JSA headquarters. He is later put on trial for his actions in Khandaq and pleads guilty to all charges. Teammate Stargirl promises to \\"be there for him\\" when he gets out. Whilst in jail, he is approached by the founder of the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller. In 52, he is seen assembling a new Suicide Squad under Waller's orders, instructed to fight Black Adam, and, unbeknownst to Atom Smasher himself, push his family to overreact. They succeed, and Osiris is disgraced and exposed for having killed a Squad member, as Amanda Waller was filming the events, leading to the downfall of the whole Black Marvel Family, and a murderous rampage of Black Adam, dubbed World War III. He then sides with the Justice Society, trying to apprehend Black Adam, but refuses to condemn him in any way, not even believing him guilty of the genocide in Bialya (\\"Tell me it wasn't you...\\"). When Adam is robbed of his powers by Captain Marvel, and is about to plunge to his death, it is Atom Smasher who saves him, though no character ever sees this, and Al keeps it hidden. In the Black Adam: The Dark Age series, Albert is shown searching for his former friend, who is intent upon resurrecting his dead wife Isis. In Black Adam #5, Albert brings Adam a bone from Isis' remains (unbeknownst to the JSA, with whom he was searching for Adam), and tries unsuccessfully to persuade his friend to go into hiding. Modern-day JSA issues In the Justice Society of America: The Kingdom special, Stargirl recruits Atom Smasher to knock some sense into Damage, who has become an evangelist of sorts for the Third World god Gog after the cosmic being (temporarily) healed his scarred face. He views Pratt's son as a brother figure, since he was brought up by Pratt in the first place. Atom Smasher finally returns to the JSA during the \\"Black Adam and Isis\\" arc printed in Justice Society of America #23‚Äì25. Asking the team for a second chance at honoring the memory of Al Pratt, Atom Smasher joins the Justice Society in battling Black Adam and Isis, who have robbed Captain Marvel of his powers and his throne at the Rock of Eternity. At the conclusion of the story, despite Wildcat's distrust, Atom Smasher is readmitted into the JSA as a full member,Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #23‚Äì25 (January‚ÄìApril 2009). DC Comics. along with all the other members of the team who had acted poorly in recent issues. He vanishes for several issues, but he reappears in the JSA: All-Stars book as a victim of kidnapping. In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Atom Smasher returns to the DC Universe alongside the rest of the Justice Society of America when Doctor Manhattan, inspired by Superman, undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.Doomsday Clock #12 (February 2020). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Already super strong at his normal size ‚Äî 7 ft 6 in, or 2.3 m ‚Äî (though recently he has been depicted as being of a more normal height when not using his powers), Atom Smasher's strength and density increase proportionately to whatever size he chooses (it was explained in JSA #75 that his muscles and bones actually break and reform as they grow in order to achieve these great heights). In the DC Encyclopedia, it is stated that he could grow up to 60 feet without problems. Whether there is a limit to the heights he can grow to is unknown. At 60 feet, he was strong enough to knock out Power Girl with one stomp, and easily decimated most of the JSA during \\"Black Reign\\", but he is vulnerable to super-strong punches from the likes of Black Adam, being knocked unconscious with one blow several times. During his time as Nuklon, Albert was able to phase through walls; he has not been shown using this power in recent years, but it is unclear whether it has been retconned away. Rothstein is also a skilled pilot and mechanic. In the first few years of JSA, he could be seen piloting the JSA's jet, the Steel Eagle, as well as the Star Rocket Racer in JSA: Our Worlds at War, and earlier being Infinity, Inc.'s primary pilot. Relationships with women Albert has had complicated relationships with women during his tenure on various super-hero teams. While on Infinity, Inc., he was shown to be clearly in love with teammate Fury, despite her engagement to his friend Silver Scarab. Many other characters make note of this, though none of them begrudge Al, and actually feel sorry for him because he will inevitably have his heart broken. Looking up to her even as children, he eventually proposes when Hector is killed and she is left pregnant, so that she will not be alone. She turns him down, saying that she prefers them to be friends. He also has a brief flirtation with the second Wildcat Yolanda Montez, but things never developed between them. During his time with the League, he dates Fire, but he discontinues the relationship because she is not Jewish ‚Äî even though this did not stop his earlier or later crushes. His relationship with Stargirl is even more complex. While Stargirl has shown some romantic feelings for Atom Smasher in the past, there is never any reciprocation on his part. Later issues clearly establish Stargirl's true feelings, as various friends (such as Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) or her friend Mary) accuse her of liking Al, and she promises to wait for him upon his return from prison. When Al is killed temporarily by The Spectre, she reveals the depths of her feelings for him, weeping over his dead body. Albert finally acknowledges his own feelings when he rejoins the JSA to fight Black Adam, admitting that Billy Batson deserves her far more than Al himself does, in a regretful tone. Al's teammates realize the couple's mutual attraction once they start openly fawning over each other in public, and while Power Girl is supportive (\\"Go rescue your fair maiden\\"), the elder members force Al to turn Courtney down due to the age difference. This leaves Al melancholy, and Courtney runs off crying. Later issues of JSA: All-Stars reveal the two still love each other, but after Johnny Sorrow mimics Al to force a kiss from the young girl, they both recognize the need for \\"space\\". In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Year 5 Annual, (Injustice is outside of the regular DC universe continuity) he's revealed to be in a relationship with Giganta, but they both frequently argue and bicker, leading to them getting into huge fights. According to Yellow Lantern, they argue and bicker a lot, but they always end up making up. While cleaning up Metropolis, the 2 of them argue over a metal girder and start fighting, trashing half of the city. Other versions=Kingdom Come Al was part of Superman's Justice League in Mark Waid and Alex Ross' Kingdom Come under the code-name \\"Atom Smasher\\". This was the debut of his new name, which was later used in mainstream DC continuity. Injustice: Gods Among Us Atom Smasher makes a cameo appearance as an Easter egg outside the Hall of Justice stage where he is fighting the villain Giganta in the background while the player is fighting. In other media=Television * In the Justice League episode \\"Legends\\", a character named Tom Turbine, voiced by Ted McGinley, appears as a superhero from an alternate universe and member of the Justice Guild of America. During his time as a superhero, Turbine battled the Injustice Guild and died alongside the rest of the JGA during a war that destroyed most of their world. Years later, psionic metahuman Ray Thompson recreated the JGA as part of an illusion, who \\"died\\" a second time to defeat him. According to series producer Bruce Timm, Tom Turbine was based primarily on the Golden Age Atom, Al Pratt, though characteristics of early Superman and Atom Smasher were incorporated into the character as well.

The current members are Michael Gibbons (guitar), John Gibbons (guitar), Isobel Sollenberger (flute and vocals), Clint Takeda (bass guitar) and Jason Kourkounis (drums). Bardo Pond's music is often classified as space rock, acid rock, post-rock, shoegazing, noise or psychedelic rock. Some Bardo Pond album titles have been derived from the names of esoteric psychedelic substances. Their sound has been likened to Pink Floyd, Spacemen 3 and My Bloody Valentine amongst others. Allmusic describes Bardo Pond as having \\"lengthy, deliberate sound explorations filled with all the hallmarks of modern-day space rock: droning guitars, thick distortion, feedback, reverb, and washes of white noise.\\" Bardo Pond are a taper-friendly band who encourage fans to make recordings of their shows. Early years According to guitarist Michael Gibbons, the band members came together post-university: \\"...we were basically just out of college, actually, and we just got really interested in free music, and that‚Äôs where it started. And we were artists too [a number of the band are visual artists]. So were just started playing free improvised sounds ‚Äì it was really just kind of that love of making noise and sounds that got us together. Basically we didn‚Äôt really learn how to play songs until after about four years, and that‚Äôs when things started clicking, and we actually made up songs. But it‚Äôs still the same thing‚Äù. Joining with guitarist Clint Takeda, they began jamming, and Takeda gave the trio the name Bardo Pond, from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. At the same time, school chums Sollenberger and Sentz joined the group. The group released the first of several self-distributed cassettes, Shone Like a Ton, in 1992, before releasing Bufo Alvarius on Drunken Fish Records in 1995. Their next record, 1996's Amanita, marked the band's transition to Matador Records and international distribution. Side projects The members of Bardo Pond also operate a number of side projects. 500 mg is Michael Gibbons' solo project. Alasehir is a psychedelic/stoner rock trio featuring Michael Gibbons, John Gibbons and Jason Kourkounis. Alumbrados produces psychedelic folk/drone music and consists of Michael Gibbons, John Gibbons, Michael Zanghi and Aaron Igler. Prairie Dog Flesh is more improvisational and rearranges the members of Bardo Pond with Takeda on vocals. Hash Jar Tempo is a collaboration between Bardo Pond and Roy Montgomery. A pun on Ash Ra Tempel, this project resulted from two \\"marathon jam/recording sessions\\" between the two parties and produced two albums: Well Oiled (released in 1997, recorded in 1995) and Under Glass (released in 1999, recorded in 1998). LSD Pond is a collaboration between Bardo Pond and Japanese psychedelic rock band LSD March. A self-titled album was released in 2008 and contains two discs with live recordings of two nights of jamming. Moon Phantoms is a collaboration between Bardo Pond and Japanese psychedelic rock band Suishou No Fune. Their self-titled album was released in 2009. Third Troll features Michael and John Gibbons (guitars), Sollenberger (flute), and includes Kevin Moist (saxophone) and Aaron Igler (synths). Baikal conducts free form psych experiments. The band consists of John Gibbons, Michael Gibbons, Clint Takeda and Jason Kourkonis. They have released a self-titled album on Important Records. Vapour Theories is a duo of Michael and John Gibbons. They have released two albums: 'Decant' (self-released), and 'Joint Chiefs' (The Lotus Sound). Jason Kourkounis participated as drummer 72 in the Boredoms' 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007, at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. He is also currently in Hot Snakes and The Night Marchers, and previously played drums for The Delta 72, The Burning Brides, and Mule (band).

It was founded in July 1993 by co-chairmen and brothers David Gardner and Tom Gardner, and Erik Rydholm, who has since left the company. Its main business is online subscription services with investing recommendations, stock research, and analysis. The company employs over 300 people worldwide.  Company name  The name ‚ÄúMotley Fool‚Äù is taken from Shakespeare‚Äôs comedy As You Like It. It references the one character ‚Äî the court jester ‚Äî who could speak the truth to the Duke without having his head lopped off.  History = Early years  In 1994, The Motley Fool published a series of messages online promoting a nonexistent sewage-disposal company. The messages, which were an April Fool's joke designed to teach a lesson about penny stock investing, garnered widespread attention, including an article in The Wall Street Journal. In August of that year, the Gardners parlayed their one-year-old investment newsletter into a content partnership with America Online (AOL). In December, they were profiled in the \\"Talk of the Town\\" section of the New Yorker. In 1996, David and Tom Gardner published The Motley Fool Investment Guide, which ranked on bestseller lists for both The New York Times and Bloomberg Businessweek. The book was controversial; Bloomberg wrote about The Motley Fool's \\"Fanatical following,\\" while a PBS Frontline episode described the company as made up of \\"20-somethings\\" giving \\"so-called advice.\\" In 1997, the Motley Fool's online presence moved from AOL to its own domain, Fool.com, where it continued to provide investing advice under an advertising-based revenue model.  \\"Foolish Four\\" and dot-com bust  In 1999, the Motley Fool was criticized by Jason Zweig for its \\"Foolish Four\\" investment theory. This idea had been marketed as a way to \\"crush mutual funds [in] only 15 minutes a year\\" by using a mathematical formula to find stocks predicted to grow much more than average. In 2000, Motley Fool writer Ann Coleman admitted that the Foolish Four method \\"turned out to be not nearly as wonderful a strategy as we thought.\\" During the dot-com bubble and market collapse of 2001, the company lost 80% of its staff in three rounds of layoffs. It also closed its operations in Germany and Japan, which have since been reestablished.  Expansion  In April 2002, The Motley Fool shifted to a subscription-based business model with the launch of its first subscription service for investment advice. The company launched their Stock Advisor program which is still in service today. The Stock Advisor program offers monthly stock picks and premium investment education to subscribers. The company also established free and subscription-based businesses in several countries. As of 2019, The Motley Fool has operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, and Japan. In October 2019, the company announced that it was shutting down operations in Singapore. In August 2018, the company launched a personal-finance sub-brand called The Ascent to provide personal finance product reviews and free educational resources. In September 2019, the Motley Fool launched two more sub-brands. Millionacres provides subscription-based real estate investing advice and real estate resources.  Legislative efforts  Representatives of The Motley Fool have testified before Congress against mutual fund fees, in support of fair financial disclosure, on the collapse of Enron, and the IPO process. In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed Regulation Fair Disclosure, which would require companies to simultaneously give important information to Wall Street analysts and the public at large. In December 1999, Motley Fool author Bill Barker wrote an article telling readers to post comments on the SEC's website. The regulation passed, and in the July 2, 2001, edition of The Wall Street Journal, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt is quoted saying, ‚ÄúTwo thirds of our letters came from Fools. Without them, Reg FD would not have happened.‚Äù See also *Investopedia *Seeking Alpha *Totalise plc v Motley Fool Ltd *Wall Street Survivor ReferencesExternal links * Category:Financial services companies established in 1993 Category:Companies based in Alexandria, Virginia Category:Internet properties established in 1993 Category:Internet forums Category:Investment in the United States Category:Economics websites Category:Finance websites Category:Webby Award winners Category:American companies established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Virginia ","title":"The Motley Fool"},{"id":"1515936","text":"Dancing Ledge from the west Dancing Ledge seen from the steps Dancing Ledge is part of the Jurassic Coast near Langton Matravers in the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, England. Dancing Ledge is a flat area of rock at the base of a small cliff. A little scrambling is required for access. It is signposted on the South West Coast Path a few kilometres west of Swanage. Dancing Ledge is so called because at certain stages of the tide when the waves wash over the horizontal surface, the surface undulations cause the water to bob about making the ledge appear to dance. History The area was used for quarrying of Purbeck stone and the ledge is a straight drop off into the sea which is deep enough for small ships to come right up to the ledge. This depth was exploited by local quarrymen in transporting the stone away from the area. Some of the stone removed by the quarrying was transported by ship direct from Dancing Ledge, round the south coast to Kent in order to construct Ramsgate harbour in the 18th and 19th centuries. Leisure A swimming pool was blasted into the rock for the use of local preparatory schools, particularly Durnford School sometime near the beginning of the twentieth century. The last surviving school (The Old Malthouse in Langton Matravers, which closed in 2007) and one of the schools for which the pool was originally created recently arranged for debris, including several large rocks, to be removed, making swimming possible once again. The sea itself is not suitable for swimming, as there is no shoreline, simply a rock shelf under which people have been pulled by the current to their deaths. The cliffs above the ledge are a popular climbing location, with a small (10m) cliff close to the sea, and a larger (~20m) limestone cliff set back above this. It is also a popular spot for tombstoning.

He has led his own band and won five Grammy Awards. Early life Robert Cray was born on August 1, 1953, in Columbus, Georgia, while his father was stationed at Fort Benning. Cray's musical beginnings go back to when he was a student at Denbigh High School in Newport News, Virginia. While there, he played in his first band, The One-Way Street. His family eventually settled in the Tacoma, Washington, area. There, he attended Lakes High School in Lakewood, Washington. Career By the age of twenty, Cray had seen his heroes Albert Collins, Freddie King and Muddy Waters in concert and decided to form his own band; they began playing college towns on the West Coast. In the late 1970s he lived in Eugene, Oregon, where he formed the Robert Cray Band and collaborated with Curtis Salgado in the Cray-Hawks. In the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House, Cray was the uncredited bassist in the house party band Otis Day and the Knights. 1980's Cray released the album Who's Been Talkin' on Tomato Records in 1980. Two albums on HighTone Records in the mid-1980s, Bad Influence and False Accusations, were moderately successful in the United States and in Europe, where he was building a reputation as a live artist. In 1985, he released the album Showdown! with his hero Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland. Cray was signed to Mercury Records and in 1986 released his fourth album, Strong Persuader, produced by Dennis Walker, which received a Grammy Award, while the crossover single \\"Smokin' Gun\\" gave him wider appeal and name recognition. Under the pseudonym \\"Night Train Clemons\\", he recorded with Ted Hawkins in 1986. He was invited by Keith Richards to join the backing band for Chuck Berry in the 1987 film, Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'N' Roll, directed by Taylor Hackford. By now, Cray was an opening act for such major stars as Eric Clapton and sold out larger venues as a solo artist. Cray has generally played Fender guitars (Telecasters and Stratocasters) and there are two signature Robert Cray Stratocasters models available from Fender. The Robert Cray Custom Shop Stratocaster is made in the U.S. in the Fender custom shop and is identical to the guitars that Cray currently plays, while the Robert Cray Standard Stratocaster is a less- expensive model made in Fender's Ensenada, Mexico plant. In 1987, Tina Turner invited Cray to be part of her television special during her record breaking Break Every Rule world tour, exposing Cray to an international audience. 1990's Cray had the opportunity to play alongside John Lee Hooker on his album Boom Boom, playing the guitar solo in the song \\"Same Old Blues Again\\". He is also featured on the Hooker album, The Healer; he plays a guitar solo on the song \\"Baby Lee\\". The entire Robert Cray Band backs Hooker on the title track of his 1992 album Mr. Lucky, where Cray plays lead guitar, sings, and banters with Hooker throughout the song. In August 1990, Cray played with Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Stevie Ray Vaughan at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin, performing \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\". This was Stevie Ray Vaughan's final performance before he died in a helicopter accident later that night. Cray was invited to play at the \\"Guitar Legends\\" concerts in Seville, Spain at the 1992 Expo, where he played a signature track, \\"Phone Booth\\". Albert Collins was also on the bill on this blues night of the \\"Legends\\" gigs. 2000 - Current Cray continues to record and tour. He appeared at the Crossroads Guitar Festival, and supported Eric Clapton on his 2006-2007 world tour. In 2011, Cray was inducted to the Blues Hall of Fame and received the Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Performance in 2017.

Tea drinking began as early as 1500 BC in the Yunnan Province of China. It first became known to western civilization through Portuguese priests and merchants in Lebanon during the 16th century. Drinking tea became popular in Britain during the 17th century. The British introduced tea production, as well as tea consumption, to India, in order to compete with the Chinese monopoly on tea. Geographic origins Brick tea Camellia sinensis originated in southeast Asia, specifically around the intersection of latitude 29¬∞N and longitude 98¬∞E, the point of confluence of the lands of northeast India, north Burma, southwest China and Tibet. The plant was introduced to more than 52 countries, from this centre of origin. citing Mondal (2007) p. 519 On morphological differences between the Assam and Chinese varieties, botanists have long asserted a dual botanical origin for tea; however, statistical cluster analysis, the same chromosome number (2n=30), easy hybridization, and various types of intermediate hybrids and spontaneous polyploids all appear to demonstrate a single place of origin for Camellia sinensis‚Äîthe area including the northern part of Burma , and Yunnan and Sichuan provinces of China. For a long time, botanists have asserted the dualism of tea origin from their observations that there exist distinct differences in the morphological characteristics between Assamese varieties and Chinese varieties. Hashimoto and Shimura report that the differences in the morphological characteristics in tea plants are not necessarily the evidence of the dualism hypothesis from the researches using the statistical cluster analysis method. In recent investigations, it has also been made clear that both varieties have the same chromosome number (2n=30) and can be easily hybridized with each other. In addition, various types of intermediate hybrids or spontaneous polyploids of tea plants have been found in a wide area extending over the regions mentioned above. These facts may prove that the place of origin of Camellia sinensis is in the area including the northern part of the Burma, Yunnan, and Sichuan districts of China.\\" Yunnan Province has also been identified as \\"the birthplace of tea...the first area where humans figured out that eating tea leaves or brewing a cup could be pleasant.\\" Fengqing County in the Lincang City Prefecture of Yunnan Province in China is said to be home to the world's oldest cultivated tea tree, some 3,200 years old.The Oldest Tea Tree on the Earth, (Kunming, 2006). According to The Story of Tea, tea drinking likely began in Yunnan province during the Shang Dynasty (1500 BC‚Äì1046 BC), as a medicinal drink. From there, the drink spread to Sichuan, and it is believed that there \\"for the first time, people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction.\\" Scholars believe that tea drinking likely originated in the southwest of China and that the Chinese words for tea may have been originally derived from the Austro-Asiatic languages of the people who originally inhabited that area.  Origin myths  Japanese painting depicting Shennong. In one popular Chinese legend, Emperor Shennong was drinking a bowl of just boiled water because of a decree that his subjects must boil water before drinking it.Saberi, Helen. Tea, a global history. London. Reaktion books ltd. 2010. Print. Some time around 2737 BC, a few leaves were blown from a nearby tree into his water, changing the color and taste. The emperor took a sip of the brew and was pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. A variant of the legend tells that the emperor tested the medical properties of various herbs on himself, some of them poisonous, and found tea to work as an antidote.Chow pp.19-20 (Czech edition); also Arcimovicova p.9, Evans p.2 and others Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's famous early work on the subject, The Classic of Tea.Lu Ju pp.29-30 (Czech edition) A similar Chinese legend states that the god of agriculture would chew the leaves, stems, and roots of various plants to discover medicinal herbs. If he consumed a poisonous plant, he would chew tea leaves to counteract the poison. A rather gruesome legend dates back to the Tang dynasty. In the legend, Bodhidharma, the founder of Chan Buddhism, accidentally fell asleep after meditating in front of a wall for nine years. He woke up in such disgust at his weakness that he cut off his eyelids. They fell to the ground and took root, growing into tea bushes.Chow pp.20-21 Another version of the story has Gautama Buddha in place of Bodhidharma.Evans p. 3 Early history= China  Lu Yu's statue in Xi'an The Chinese have consumed tea for thousands of years. The earliest physical evidence known to date, found in 2016, comes from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi'an, indicating that tea was drunk by Han dynasty emperors as early as the 2nd century BC. The samples were identified as tea from the genus Camellia particularly via mass spectrometry, and written records suggest that it may have been drunk earlier. People of the Han dynasty used tea as medicine (though the first use of tea as a stimulant is unknown). China is considered to have the earliest records of tea consumption, with possible records dating back to the 10th century BC. Note however that the current word for tea in Chinese only came into use in the 8th century AD, there are therefore uncertainties as to whether the older words used are the same as tea. The word tu Ëçº appears in Shijing and other ancient texts to signify a kind of \\"bitter vegetable\\" (Ëã¶Ëèú), and it is possible that it referred to several different plants, such as sow thistle, chicory, or smartweed, including tea. In the Chronicles of Huayang, it was recorded that the Ba people in Sichuan presented tu to the Zhou king. The state of Ba and its neighbour Shu were later conquered by the Qin, and according to the 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu who wrote in Ri Zhi Lu (Êó•Áü•ÈåÑ): \\"It was after the Qin had taken Shu that they learned how to drink tea.\\" The first known reference to boiling tea came from the Han dynasty work \\"The Contract for a Youth\\" written by Wang Bao where, among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth, \\"he shall boil tea and fill the utensils\\" and \\"he shall buy tea at Wuyang\\". The first record of cultivation of tea also dated it to this period (Ganlu era of Emperor Xuan of Han) when tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain (ËíôÂ±±) near Chengdu. From the Tang to the Qing dynasties, the first 360 leaves of tea grown here were picked each spring and presented to the emperor. Even today its green and yellow teas, such as the Mengding Ganlu tea, are still sought after. An early credible record of tea drinking dates to 220 AD, in a medical text Shi Lun (È£üËÆ∫) by Hua Tuo, who stated, \\"to drink bitter t'u constantly makes one think better.\\" Another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the Qin dynasty general Liu Kun.Martin, p. 29: \\"beginning in the third century CE, references to tea seem more credible, in particular those dating to the time of Hua T'o, a highly respected physician and surgeon\\" However, before the mid-8th century Tang dynasty, tea-drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice. It became widely popular during the Tang dynasty, when it was spread to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Laozi, the classical Chinese philosopher, was said to describe tea as \\"the froth of the liquid jade\\" and named it an indispensable ingredient to the elixir of life. Legend has it that master Lao was saddened by society's moral decay, and sensing that the end of the dynasty was near, he journeyed westward to the unsettled territories, never to be seen again. While passing along the nation's border, he encountered and was offered tea by a customs inspector named Yin Hsi. Yin Hsi encouraged him to compile his teachings into a single book so that future generations might benefit from his wisdom. This became known as the Dao De Jing, a collection of Laozi's sayings. Tang dynasty writer Lu Yu's () Cha Jing (The Classic of Tea) () is an early work on the subject. According to Cha Jing, tea drinking was widespread. The book describes how tea plants were grown, the leaves processed, and tea prepared as a beverage. It also describes how tea was evaluated. The book also discusses where the best tea leaves were produced. Teas produced in this period were mainly tea bricks which were often used as currency, especially further from the center of the empire where coins lost their value. In this period, tea leaves were steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake or brick forms. During the Song dynasty, production and preparation of all tea changed. The tea included many loose- leaf styles (to preserve the delicate character favored by court society), and it is the origin of today's loose teas and the practice of brewed tea. A powdered form of tea also emerged. Steaming tea leaves was the primary process used for centuries in the preparation of tea. After the transition from compressed tea to the powdered form, the production of tea for trade and distribution changed once again. Illustration of the legend of monkeys harvesting tea The Chinese learned to process tea in a different way in the mid-13th century. Tea leaves were roasted and then crumbled rather than steamed. By the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unfermented tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried. This stops the oxidation process which turns the leaves dark and allows tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, where the tea leaves were allowed to partially ferment before pan-frying, was developed. Western taste, however, preferred the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to ferment further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, which yielded a different flavour as a result. Tea production in China, historically, was a laborious process, conducted in distant and often poorly accessible regions. This led to the rise of many apocryphal stories and legends surrounding the harvesting process. For example, one story that has been told for many years is that of a village where monkeys pick tea. According to this legend, the villagers stand below the monkeys and taunt them. The monkeys, in turn, become angry, and grab handfuls of tea leaves and throw them at the villagers. There are products sold today that claim to be harvested in this manner, but no reliable commentators have observed this firsthand, and most doubt that it happened at all. For many hundreds of years the commercially used tea tree has been, in shape, more of a bush than a tree. \\"Monkey picked tea\\" is more likely a name of certain varieties than a description of how it was obtained. In 1391, the Hongwu emperor issued a decree that only loose tea would be accepted as a \\"tribute\\". As a result, tea production shifted from cake tea to loose- leaf tea and processing techniques advanced, giving rise to the more energy efficient methods of pan-firing and sun-drying, which were popular in Jiangnan and Fujian respectively.The last group to adopt loose-leaf tea were the literati, who were reluctant to abandon their refined culture of whisking tea until the invention of oolong tea. By the end of the 16th century, loose-leaf tea had entirely replaced the earlier tradition of cake and powdered tea.  Japan  Ancient Tea Urns used by merchants to store tea Japanese tea ceremony During the Sui dynasty in China tea was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monks. Tea use spread during the 6th century AD. Tea became a drink of the religious classes in Japan when Japanese priests and envoys, sent to China to learn about its culture, brought tea to Japan. Ancient recordings indicate the first batch of tea seeds were brought by a priest named in 805 and then by another named in 806. It became a drink of the royal classes when encouraged the growth of tea plants. Seeds were imported from China, and cultivation in Japan began. In 1191, Zen priest introduced tea seeds to Kyoto. Some of the tea seeds were given to the priest Myoe Shonin, and became the basis for Uji tea. The oldest tea specialty book in Japan, , was written by Eisai. The two-volume book was written in 1211 after his second and last visit to China. The first sentence states, \\"Tea is the ultimate mental and medical remedy and has the ability to make one's life more full and complete.\\" Eisai was also instrumental in introducing tea consumption to the warrior class, which rose to political prominence after the Heian period. Green tea became a staple among cultured people in Japan‚Äîa brew for the gentry and the Buddhist priesthood alike. Production grew and tea became increasingly accessible, though still a privilege enjoyed mostly by the upper classes. The tea ceremony of Japan was introduced from China in the 15th century by Buddhists as a semi- religious social custom. The modern tea ceremony developed over several centuries by Zen Buddhist monks under the original guidance of the monk . In fact, both the beverage and the ceremony surrounding it played a prominent role in feudal diplomacy. In 1738, Soen Nagatani developed Japanese , literally simmered tea, which is an unfermented form of green tea. It is the most popular form of tea in Japan today. The name can be confusing because sencha is no longer simmered. While sencha is currently prepared by steeping the leaves in hot water, this was not always the case. Sencha was originally prepared by casting the leaves into a cauldron and simmering briefly. The liquid would then be ladled into bowls and served. In 1835, Kahei Yamamoto developed , literally jewel dew, by shading tea trees during the weeks leading up to harvesting. By the 20th cenutry, machine manufacturing of green tea was introduced and began replacing handmade tea.  Korea  Darye, Korean tea ceremony The first historical record documenting the offering of tea to an ancestral god describes a rite in 661 AD in which a tea offering was made to the spirit of King Suro, the founder of the Geumgwan Gaya Kingdom. Records from the Goryeo dynasty (918‚Äì1392) show that tea offerings were made in Buddhist temples to the spirits of revered monks. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), the royal Yi family and the aristocracy used tea for simple rites. The \\"Day Tea Rite\\" was a common daytime ceremony, whereas the \\"Special Tea Rite\\" was reserved for specific occasions. Toward the end of the Joseon Dynasty, commoners joined the trend and used tea for ancestral rites, following the Chinese example based on Zhu Xi's text formalities of family. Stoneware was common, ceramic more frequent, mostly made in provincial kilns, with porcelain rare, imperial porcelain with dragons the rarest. The earliest kinds of tea used in tea ceremonies were heavily pressed cakes of black tea, the equivalent of aged pu-erh tea in China. However, importation of tea plants by Buddhist monks brought a more delicate series of teas into Korea, and the tea ceremony. Green tea, \\"Jakseol(ÏûëÏÑ§, ÈõÄËàå)\\" or \\"Jungno(Ï£ΩÎ°ú, Á´πÈú≤)\\", is most often served. However, other teas such as \\"Byeoksoryeong(Î≤ΩÏÜåÎ†π, Á¢ßÂÆµÂ∂∫)\\" Cheonhachun(Ï≤úÌïòÏ∂ò, Â§©‰∏ãÊò•), Ujeon(Ïö∞Ï†Ñ, Èõ®Ââç), Okcheon(Ïò•Ï≤ú, ÁéâÊ≥â), as well as native chrysanthemum tea, persimmon leaf tea, or mugwort tea may be served at different times of the year.  Global expansion  A conical urn-shaped silver-plated samovar used for boiling water for tea in Russia and some Middle eastern countries The earliest record of tea in a more occidental writing is said to be found in the statement of an Arabian traveler, that after 879 the main sources of revenue in Canton were the duties on salt and tea. Marco Polo records the deposition of a Chinese minister of finance in 1285 for his arbitrary augmentation of the tea taxes. In 1557, Portugal established a trading port in Macau, and word of the Chinese drink \\"ch√°\\" spread quickly, but there is no mention of them bringing any samples home. In the early 17th century, a ship of the Dutch East India Company brought the first green tea leaves to Amsterdam from China. Tea was known in France by 1636. It enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Paris around 1648. The history of tea in Russia can also be traced back to the 17th century. Tea was first offered by China as a gift to Czar Michael I in 1618. The Russian ambassador tried the drink; he did not care for it and rejected the offer, delaying tea's Russian introduction by fifty years. By 1689, tea was regularly imported from China to Russia via a caravan of hundreds of camels traveling the year-long journey, making it a precious commodity at the time. Tea was appearing in German apothecaries by 1657 but never gained much esteem except in coastal areas such as Ostfriesland.Book of Tea By Kakuz≈ç Okakura (pp. 5‚Äì6). Published 1964. Courier Dover Publications. Sociology. 94 pages. Tea first appeared publicly in England during the 1650s, where it was introduced through coffeehouses. From there it was introduced to British colonies in America and elsewhere.  Portugal and Italy  Tea was first introduced to Europe by Italian traveler Giovanni Battista Ramusio, who in 1555 published Voyages and Travels, containing the first European reference to tea, which he calls \\"Chai Catai\\"; his accounts were based on second-hand reports in the polities of the Gulf of Aden; Yemen and Somalia. Portuguese priests and merchants in the 16th century made their first contact with tea in China, at which time it was termed ch√°. The first Portuguese ships reached China in 1516, and in 1560 Portuguese missionary Gaspar da Cruz published the first Portuguese account of Chinese tea; in 1565 Portuguese missionary Louis Almeida published the first European account of tea in Japan.  India  A view of tea Plantations in Munnar, Kerala, India. Tea Garden in Assam, India Commercial production of tea was first introduced into India by the British, in an attempt to break the Chinese monopoly on tea. The British, using Chinese seeds, plus Chinese planting and cultivating techniques, launched a tea industry by offering land in Assam to any European who agreed to cultivate tea for export. Tea was originally only consumed by Anglicized Indians; it was not until the 1950s that tea grew widely popular in India through a successful advertising campaign by the India Tea Board.Sen, Colleen Taylor. p. 26. \\"Ironically, it was the British who introduced tea drinking to India, initially to anglicized Indians.. tea did not become a mass drink in India until the 1950s when the India Tea Board, faced with a surplus of low-grade tea, launched an advertising campaign to popularize tea in the North, where the drink of choice was milk.\\" Prior to the British, the plant may have been used for medicinal purposes. Some cite the Sanjeevani plant as the first recorded reference of tea use in India. However, scientific studies have shown that the Sanjeevani plant is in fact a different plant and is not related to tea. The Singpho tribe and the Khamti tribe validate that they have been consuming tea since the 12th century. However, commercial production of tea in India did not begin until the arrival of the British East India Company, at which point large tracts of land were converted for mass tea production. The Chinese variety is used for Sikkim, Darjeeling tea, and Kangra tea, while the Assam variety, clonal to the native to Assam, was used everywhere else. The British started commercial tea plantations in India and in Ceylon: \\"In 1824 tea plants were discovered in the hills along the frontier between Burma and Assam. The British introduced tea culture into India in 1836 and into Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1867. At first they used seeds from China, but later seeds from the clonal Assam plant were used.\\"tea. (2008). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2008 Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Only black tea was produced until recent decades mostly in India, except in Kangra (present-day Himachal Pradesh) which produced green tea for exporting to central Asia, Afghanistan and neighboring countries. Kangra, a tea-growing region in India, known for its green tea production. India was the top producer of tea for nearly a century but was displaced by China as the top tea producer in the 21st century. Indian tea companies have acquired a number of iconic foreign tea enterprises including British brands Lipton, Tetley, Twinings and Typhoo. Most of the Indian tea garden owners have focused on exports to markets like Europe and Russia, while very few have focused on building their own brands such as Makaibari, Dharmsala Tea Company, and a few others. While India is the largest consumer of tea worldwide, the per-capita consumption of tea in India remains a modest 750 grams per person annually. Recently consumption of green tea has seen a great upsurge across the cities, and regions such as Kangra which were known for their green tea production historically, have seen a resurgence of their green teas in the domestic market.  Iran  Tea harvest in Lahijan, Iran Gilan in north of Iran is main production center of Iranian tea. Historically, Lahijan is the first town in Iran to have tea plantations. With its mild weather, soil quality and fresh spring water, Lahijan stands to have the largest area of tea cultivation in Iran. \\"Lahijan Spring Tea\\" is the best quality tea produced in the country. Tea is cultivated at other cities of Gilan, for example Fuman and Roudsar.  Taiwan  Tea plantation in Taiwan Taiwan is famous for the making of oolong tea and green tea, as well as many western-styled teas. Bubble tea or \\"Zhen Zhu Nai Cha\\" (Mandarin: ÁèçÁè†Â•∂Ëå∂) is black tea mixed with sweetened condensed milk and tapioca. Since the island was known to Westerners for many centuries as Formosa‚Äîshort for the Portuguese Ilha Formosa, or \\"beautiful island\\"‚Äîtea grown in Taiwan is often identified by that name.  United Kingdom  Tea plantation in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia The first record of tea in English came from a letter written by Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, writing to a merchant in Macao requesting \\"the best sort of chaw\\" in 1615. Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fuji in 1637, wrote, \\"chaa‚Äîonly water with a kind of herb boiled in it\\". In 1657, Thomas Garway, a \\"tobacconist and coffee-man\\" was the first to sell tea in London at his house in Exchange Alley, charging between 16 and 50 shillings per pound. The same year, tea was listed as an item in the price list in a London coffee house, and the first advertisement for tea appeared in 1658. In 1660 Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: \\"I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before.\\" It is probable that early imports were smuggled via Amsterdam or through sailors arriving on eastern boats. The marriage of King Charles II in 1662 to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza brought the tea drinking habit to court. Official trade of tea began in 1664 with an import of only two pound two ounces for presentation to the king, which grew to 24 million pounds per year by 1801. Regular trade began in Canton (now Guangzhou), where it was controlled by two monopolies: the Chinese Cohong (trading companies) and the British East India Company. The Cohong acquired tea from 'tea men' who had an elaborate supply chain into the mountains and provinces where tea grew. The East India Company brought back many products, of which tea was just one, which proved one of the most successful. It was initially promoted as a medicinal beverage or tonic but by the end of the 17th century was taken as an all-purpose drink, albeit mainly by the elite, as it was expensive. Tea was traded in significant amounts by the 18th century, when tea was being sold by grocers and tea shops in London. By the 1720s black tea overtook green tea in popularity as the price dropped, and early on British drinkers began adding sugar and milk to tea, a practice that was not done in China. By the 1720s European maritime trade with China was dominated by exchange of silver for tea. As prices continued to drop, tea became increasingly popular and by 1750 had become the British national drink. A fungus reduced coffee production in Ceylon by 95% in the 19th century, cementing tea's popularity. The escalation of tea importation and sales over the period 1690 to 1750 is mirrored closely by the increase in importation and sales of cane sugar: the British were not drinking just tea but sweet tea. Thus, two of Britain's trading triangles converged: the sugar sourced from Britain's trading triangle encompassing Britain, Africa and the West Indies and the tea from the triangle encompassing Britain, India and China. In China, the Qing dynasty Qianlong Emperor wrote to King George III in response to the MaCartney Mission's request for trade in 1793: \\"Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders. There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce.\\" Tea had to be paid in silver bullion, and critics of the tea trade at this time would point to the damage caused to Britain's wealth by this loss of bullion. As a way to generate the silver needed as payment for tea, Britain began exporting opium from the traditional growing regions of British India (in present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) into China. Although opium use in China had a long history, the British importation of opium increased fivefold between 1821 and 1837, and usage of the drug became more widespread across Chinese society. The Qing government attitude towards opium, which was often ambivalent, hardened because of the social problems created by drug use and took serious measures to curtail importation of opium in 1838‚Äì39. Tea had become an important source of tax revenue for the British Empire, and the banning of the opium trade and thus the creation of funding issues for tea importers was one of the main causes of the First Opium War.Movable Feasts, Sarah Murray, 2007, pp. 161 While waging war on China was one of Britain's tactics, it also began to use India for growing tea. After tea plants were smuggled out of China, plantations were established in areas such as Darjeeling, Assam, and Ceylon.Movable Feasts, Sarah Murray, 2007, pp. 164 As an attempt to circumvent its dependence on Chinese tea, the East India Company sent Scottish botanist Robert Fortune to China to purchase and bring out of China tea plants, which were then taken to India, although it was the discovery of native varieties of tea plant in India which proved more important for the development of production there. Tea remained a very important item in Britain's global trade, contributing in part to Britain's global dominance by the end of the 18th century. To this day tea is seen worldwide as a symbol of 'Britishness', but also, to some, as a symbol of old British colonialism.  The Americas  The drinking of tea in the United States was largely influenced by the passage of the Tea Act and its subsequent protest during the American Revolution. Tea consumption sharply decreased in America during and after the Revolution, when many Americans switched from drinking tea to drinking coffee, considering tea drinking to be unpatriotic. The American specialty tea market quadrupled in the years from 1993 to 2008, now being worth $6.8 billion a year.'Tea finally making a stir in America' Times Online. Retrieved 17 February 2008. Specialty tea houses and retailers also started to pop up during this period.Campbell, Polly (April 26, 2006). \\"Suited to a tea.\\" Cincinnati Enquirer. Canadians were big tea drinkers from the days of British colonisation until the Second World War, when they began drinking more coffee like their American neighbors to the south. During the 1990s, Canadians begun to purchase more specialty teas instead of coffee. In South America, the tea production in Brazil has strong roots because of the country's origins in Portugal, the strong presence of Japanese immigrants, and because of the influences of Argentina's yerba mate culture. Brazil had a big tea production until the 1980s, but it has weakened in the past decades.  Australia  The Aboriginal Australians drank an infusion from the plant species leptospermum. Upon discovering Australia, Captain Cook noticed the aboriginal peoples drinking it and called it tea. Today the plant is referred to as the \\"ti tree\\". Through colonisation by the British, tea was introduced to Australia. In fact, tea was aboard the First Fleet in 1788. In 1884, the Cutten brothers established the first commercial tea plantation in Australia in Bingil Bay in northern Queensland. In 1883, Alfred Bushell opened the first tea shop in Australia in Queensland. In 1899, Bushell's sons moved the enterprise to Sydney and began selling tea commercially, founding Australia's first commercial tea seller Bushell's Company. In 2000, Australia consumed 14,000 tonnes of tea annually. Tea production in Australia remains very small and is primarily in northern New South Wales and Queensland. Most tea produced in Australia is black tea, although there are small quantities of green tea produced in the Alpine Valleys region of Victoria.  Sri Lanka  Tea Garden in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is renowned for its high quality tea and as the fourth biggest tea producing country globally, after China, India and Kenya, and has a production share of 9% in the international sphere. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187,309 hectares. The plantations started by the British were initially taken over by the government in the 1960s but have been privatized and are now run by plantation companies which own a few estates or tea plantations each. Ceylon tea is divided into 3 groups as Upcountry, Mid country and Low country tea based on the geography of the land on which it is grown. Africa The Somali Ajuran empire which established bilateral trading ties with Ming Dynasty China in the 13th century brought with them a myriad of commodities including tea. Africa has seen greatly increased tea production in recent decades, the great majority for export to Europe and North America respectively, produced on large estates, often owned by tea companies from the export markets. Almost all production is of basic mass-market teas, processed by the crush, tear, curl method.

Walker was the first African-American woman to charter a bank and serve as its president in the United States. As a leader, she achieved successes with the vision to make tangible improvements in the way of life for African Americans. Disabled by paralysis and a wheelchair user later in life, Walker also became an example for people with disabilities. Walker's restored and furnished home in the historic Jackson Ward neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia has been designated a National Historic Site, operated by the National Park Service.  Childhood  According to biographical material she supplied, Walker was born as Maggie Lena Draper in Richmond, Virginia, to Eccles Cuthbert and Elizabeth Draper two years and two months after the end of the American Civil War. Census information, as well as a diary passage saying that she was four years old on her mother's wedding in May 1868, with William Mitchell, set the date back to 1864 or 1865. Her mother was a former slave and an assistant cook in the Church Hill mansion of Elizabeth Van Lew, who had been a spy in the Confederate capital city of Richmond for the Union during the War, and was later postmaster for Richmond. Her stepfather was a butler and her biological father was an Irish Born Confederate soldier and a postwar writer for the New York Herald. The Mitchell family moved to their own home on College Alley off of Broad Street nearby Miss Van Lew's home where Maggie and her brother Johnnie were raised. The house was near the First African Baptist Church which, like many black churches at the time, was an economic, political, and social center for the local black community. After the untimely death of William Mitchell, Maggie's mother supported her family by working as a laundress. Young Maggie attended the newly formed Richmond Public Schools and helped her mother by delivering the clean clothes.  Leader  When she was fourteen years old, young Maggie joined the local council of the Independent Order of St. Luke. This fraternal burial society, established in 1867 in Baltimore, Maryland, ministered to the sick and aged, promoted humanitarian causes and encouraged individual self- help and integrity. She served in numerous capacities of increasing responsibility for the Order, from that of a delegate to the biannual convention to the top leadership position of Right Worthy Grand Secretary in 1899, a position she held until she died. Walker was inducted as an Honorary Member of the Nu Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority at the chapter's first meeting in 1926.  Businesswoman, banker  In 1902, she published a newspaper for the organization, The St. Luke Herald. Shortly after, she chartered the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. Walker served as the bank's first president, which earned her the recognition of being the first African American woman to charter a bank in the United States. The St. Luke Penny Savings Bank's leadership also included several female board members. Later Walker agreed to serve as chairman of the board of directors when the bank merged with two other Richmond banks to become The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, which grew to serve generations of Richmonders as an African-American owned institution. Walker received an honorary master's degree from Virginia Union University in 1925, and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2001.Congressional Record--Extensions of Remarks (April 26, 2001), page E646 \\"https://www.congress.gov/crec/2001/04/26/CREC-2001-04-26-pt1-PgE646.pdf\\".  Legacy  Maggie Walker High School, Richmond In Walker's honor Richmond Public Schools built a large brick high school adjacent to Virginia Union University. Maggie L. Walker High School was one of two schools in the area for black students, during the period of racial segregation in schools; the other was Armstrong High School. After generations of students spent their high-school years there, it was totally refurbished to reopen in 2001 as the regional Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies. The St. Luke Building held the offices of the Independent Order of St. Luke, and the office of Maggie L. Walker. As late as 1981, Walker's office was being preserved as it was at the time of her death in 1934. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Maggie L Walker National Historic Site, Richmond The National Park Service operates the Maggie L. Walker Historic Site at her former Jackson Ward home. In 1978 the house was designated a National Historic Site and was opened as a museum in 1985. The site states that it \\"commemorates the life of a progressive and talented African-American woman. She achieved success in the world of business and finance as the first woman in the United States to charter and serve as president of a bank, despite the many adversities. The site includes a visitor center detailing her life and the Jackson Ward community in which she lived and worked and her residence of thirty years.The house is restored to its 1930's appearance with original Walker family pieces.\\" Walker was honored as one of the first group of Virginia Women in History in 2000. On July 15, 2017, a statue of Walker, designed by Antonio Tobias Mendez was unveiled on Broad Street in Richmond. The bronze, 10-foot statue shows a depiction of how she lived, with her glasses pinned to her lapel and a checkbook in hand. In 2020, Walker was one of eight women featured in \\"The Only One in the Room\\" display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.  Family  Walker taught grade school for three years until 1886, when, that same year, on September 14, 1886, in Richmond, she married Armstead Walker Jr. (1860‚Äì1915), a brick contractor. Armstead earned a good living, and she was able to leave teaching to take care of her family and work with the Independent Order of St. Luke, which she founded in 1903. Maggie and Armstead purchased a home in 1904. They had four children: (i)Mary Polly Walker (1885‚Äì1967), who married H. Maurice Payne; (ii) Russell Eccles Talmadge Walker (1890‚Äì1923); (iii) Armstead Mitchell Walker (1893‚Äì1894); and (iv) Melvin DeWitt Walker (1897‚Äì1935). On June 20, 1914, Maggie's son, Russell Walker, at age , shot and killed his father, Armstead, having mistaken him for a burglar, for whom both he and his father had been searching. Russell was arrested and charged with murder and, after five months awaiting trial, was declared innocent. The loss left Maggie to manage a large household. Her work and investments kept the family comfortably situated. When her sons married they brought their wives to 110 East Leigh Street, her home in Richmond's Jackson Ward district, the center of Richmond's African-American business and social life around the start of the 20th century. Russell, however, never recovered from the incident and after eight years battling depression and alcoholism, died November 23, 1923. ReferencesFurther reading   External links  *NPS Maggie L.

It was created by the team of Isao Takahata (director), Hayao Miyazaki (writer, layout, scene design), Yoichi Kotabe (animation director) and Yasuo Otsuka (animation director, character design). This short movie was released in Japan at the height of the panda craze, initiated in September 1972, when the government announced the loan of a pair of giant pandas from China to the Ueno Zoo as part of panda diplomacy. A success in Japanese theaters, its creators followed up with Panda Kopanda and the Rainy-Day Circus in 1973, which was also a success. In 1974, Takahata, Miyazaki and Kotabe would create the landmark anime series Heidi, Girl of the Alps. In 1985, Takahata and Miyazaki would found Studio Ghibli. Panda Kopanda is known in North America by the title, \\"Panda! Go Panda!\\" The two short films are available on DVD and Blu-ray in Japan, and on DVD in North America.  Story  The plot follows Mimiko („Éü„ÉüÂ≠ê), a bright little girl left alone when her grandmother leaves on a trip. Making a few stops at some local stores, Mimiko comes home to her house in a bamboo grove and finds a baby panda named Panny (Pan-Chan) sleeping on the back doorstep. She quickly makes friends with the little panda, and invites him in for a drink. His father, PapaPanda, soon comes to visit, and they decide to become a family after PapaPanda offers to be Mimiko's father (Mimiko never had any parents). The three adjust to life together during their first night together, while Mimiko writes the first of many letters to her grandma (who she promised to write to every day). The next day, Mimiko goes to school, reluctantly allowing Panny to tag along (even though she told him to stay home). In a close call, Panny ends up getting all of Mimiko's school (save for Mimiko) chasing after him. The next day, Mimiko gets an unexpected visit from a local policeman, who came to check on her. Expectedly, he freaks out after seeing PapaPanda. He goes to notify the local zoo staff, who invites the zookeeper (who lost PapaPanda and Panny after they broke out of the zoo). The zookeeper demands the safe return of his pandas, so he joins the police and zoo staff in the search. Meanwhile, Mimiko and her family go out on a walk and, after scaring off some local bullies, they inadvertently lose Panny after he rolls down a hill. Mimiko and PapaPanda go searching for him, eventually gaining help from local police and the zookeeper in the search. They find Panny floating on a piece of wood, heading towards an open floodgate and hurry to save him. The handle, however, has rusted, leaving Panny in a dangerous situation. Mimiko comes very close to falling into dangerous waters after she jumps down to save Panny from death, but PapaPanda saves both of them by closing the floodgate. Mimiko, alongside Panny, PapaPanda, the zookeeper and the local police, cheer their success. PapaPanda, alongside Panny, return to work at the zoo, under the condition that they can leave after the visitors have left to spend time with Mimiko. Panda Kopanda and the Rainy-Day Circus (1973) The adventures are continued in another short movie from the same staff, . In this episode, Mimiko and the pandas meet a ringmaster and one of his cronies, who were searching for something in their home. Mimiko is overjoyed, thinking that they are burglars, but they are quickly scared off by the family, and run away in fear. The family soon starts dinner, but Panny finds his food has been eaten. In a way similar to the story of Goldilocks, Panny finds what the ringmaster was looking for: a baby tiger named Tiny (Tora-chan). After getting spooked by Tiny, Panny (along with the entire household) makes friends with the little tiger. The next day, Mimiko goes to ask around town, to see if anyone knows where Tiny is from, only to lose both Panny and Tiny when Tiny goes to see his real mother. Mimiko is invited to the local circus, which is exactly the same one that is owned by the ringmaster that had tried to break in the night before, by a few of her friends. She gladly accepts the offer. At the circus, Tiny shows Panny his balancing ball act. Panny tries to emulate the act, but ends up getting chased by the local circus performers and the ringmaster. To make matters worse, Panny crashes straight into the tiger cage, where Tiny's unhappy mother waits. Mimiko slips into the circus after someone yells that Panny is in trouble and runs into Tiny's mom. They swap the cubs (respectively, Panny to Mimiko and Tiny to his mother) and become quick friends. The ringmaster gives Mimiko and her family tickets to the show, but on the way home, a nasty storm breaks out. Overnight, it floods most of the land around Mimiko's hometown. A frantic cry of help from Tiny (in the form of a makeshift bottled message) sends Mimiko and her family in a search for him. They learn from the ringmaster that the train has all the animals, and it's stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Mimiko and her family go to free the animals, which they succeed in doing, but unintentionally cause the train to start (due to the playful antics of Panny and Tiny). The train goes off the rails, and ends up in a collision course with the mayor's house. However, PapaPanda stops the train, and Mimiko and her family become town heroes. The movie concludes with Mimiko and her panda family enjoying a day at the circus. Production In 1971, Takahata, Miyazaki and Kotabe left the Toei Animation studio to join their fellow animator and mentor Otsuka at the A Productions studio, in hopes of creating an animated series based on Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking. After extensive pre-production work, the trio travelled to Sweden to seek permission from Lindgren; their request was flatly refused. Rejected, Takahata and Miyazaki joined Otsuka on the Lupin III Part I TV series as the \\"A-Pro directors team.\\" After Lupin's cancellation in 1972, the team revisited the Pippi Longstocking project, and reworked many of its ideas and story elements into the theatrical short film, Panda Kopanda. The movie, as well as its followup, Rainy Day Circus, played as the opening short to Toho's Godzilla movies, where it was warmly received by audiences. Animator Yoshifumi Kondo, who also worked on Lupin the 3rd, served as a key animator on the two panda films, most notably a scene in Rainy Day Circus where Mimi and the pandas ride a bed across a flooded river. Kondo would play a valuable role in many later Takahata and Miyazaki films, including Anne of Green Gables, Grave of the Fireflies, and Whisper of the Heart. Quotes and influences The Panda Kopanda films, like all the works of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, contain a number of \\"riffs,\\" or direct shots quoted in other films. Panda Kopanda: The pandas of Panda! Go, Panda! are considered by some to be precursors of the Totoros, sharing many design and animation similarities, especially the Papa Panda character. Mimiko, the little girl, can be seen as a prototype of Totoro's Mei and Satsuki. Mimiko's red ponytails are directly inspired by Pippi Longstocking. Miyazaki would pay tribute again in his films Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso and Yadosagashi (House Hunting). Mimiko's handstands are quoted many times in Heidi, Girl of the Alps, 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother, and Future Boy Conan. Baby Panda's leap onto Papa Panda's chest is directly quoted in My Neighbor Totoro. Papa Panda himself bears a strong resemblance to Totoro. A shot of a policeman riding his bicycle past a truck is directly quoted in the opening scene of My Neighbor Totoro (Satsuki quips, \\"I thought it was a policeman\\"). A shot of Mimiko running around her house is quoted in My Neighbor Totoro as Satsuki and Mei run around their house. Papa Panda's enormous water splash into the lake is quoted in Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro. A pan shot of a crowd at the zoo includes cameos of Lupin and Jigen, as well as members of the production staff. Hayao Miyazaki can be seen in glasses carrying one of his sons on his shoulder. The final shot of Mimiko and the pandas walking into the sunset quotes the final shot in The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun. Rainy Day Circus: Scenes of a flooded town appear again in Ponyo on a Cliff by the Sea. A shot of Baby Panda climbing a roof directly quotes a shot from Toei's 1969 animated movie, Puss in Boots. A shot of outstretched hands chasing Baby Panda is quoted in Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind. Trains continuing to run through flash floods are referenced in Spirited Away. Home video In North America, Panda Kopanda is available on DVD, under the title, \\"Panda! Go Panda!\\", courtesy of Discotek Media. In Japan, the movie is available as a standalone DVD and Blu- ray on Studio Ghibli's Ghibli Ga Ippai label, and included in the 2015 Blu-ray box set, The Collected Works of Director Isao Takahata. English subtitles are included in the Japanese releases. ReferencesExternal links Panda!

The area has a long indigenous history, but the city itself was not founded until the early colonial period, in the 1530s. It is mostly agricultural but it is best known for its annual homage to an image of the Virgin Mary called Our Lady of Charity. This includes a month of festivities, the best known of which are the ‚Äúnight no one sleeps‚Äù when residents create six km of ‚Äúcarpets‚Äù on the streets made from colored sawdust, flowers and other materials. The other is the ‚ÄúHuamantlada‚Äù a running of the bulls similar to that in Pamplona. The town View of the San Luis Parish and the cultural center from Parque Ju√°rez The city of Huamantla is in the east of the state of Tlaxcala, about 45 km from the state capital. The main entrance to the city is marked by the Monumento al Toro (Bull Monument), a bronze sculpture by architect Di√≥doro Rodr√≠guez Anaya. It is dedicated to the regions‚Äô bull raising and fighting tradition. The city is centered on its main plaza, called Parque Ju√°rez (Juarez Park), which contains gardens and a kiosk from the beginning of the 20th century. The blocks around it conserve many historic buildings from the colonial period up through the Porfirio Di√°z era, with simple facades and iron-railed balconies. For this reason and the celebrations related to Our Lady of Charity in August, the city has been named a ‚ÄúPueblo M√°gico.‚Äù The main colonial era constructions are the parish of San Luis Obispo and the former monastery of the same name, both of which were begun in the 16th century and named after Huamantla's patron saint, Louis of Toulouse. The monastery complex was built between 1567 and 1585 and has a number of elements, focused on a main church with a simple facade. Above the door there is a niche containing an image of Saint Anthony and on either side of this, there are the coats of arms of the order. The bell tower has two levels and Solomonic columns. Inside the church, there is a chapel dedicated to a Christ figure called the Se√±or del Desposo. The main altar of this church is Churrigueresque with Neoclassical altars on the sides. To the side, there is a large open chapel with five arches supported by Tuscan columns with Doric capitals. The cloister area has been remodeled various times but original elements such as Tuscan columns remain. The Third Order chapel contains the complexes oldest oil paintings and a Baroque main altar. Puppet orchestra on display at the National Puppet Museum The San Luis Obispo Parish church is built of light stone, with a contrasting dark grey main portal. In this portal there are six niches filled with the same number of statues made from alabaster. It has a single bell tower and a small bell-gable. Inside, the main altar is Baroque with an image of Louise of Toulouse. There is also Salomonic altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary and one to Jesus the Nazarene and oil paintings from the colonial period, including one of the Virgin of Guadalupe by Miguel Cabrera. Also facing the park is the municipal palace, it is in Neoclassical style with two floors, both with balconies, framed by cornices, a style common to Huamantla. It has a simple main entrance above which are a decorative element including the Mexican coat of arms, a clock and a small bell. Inside, there is a mural by Desiderio Hern√°ndez Xochitiotzin, a reproduction of the Huamantla Codex and a photographic collection. Modern Mexican puppetry is traced to Huamantla, especially to the Rosete Aranda family which began their traveling puppet show in 1850, which lasted over a century. Today, the city is home to the Rosete Aranda National Puppet Museum, the only one of its kind in Latin America, located in a former mansion facing the main square. It contains eight main halls containing puppets, sets and other paraphernalia from this family, other puppeteers from Mexico and puppets from other countries such as Germany, Spain, France, Italy, India and Indonesia. It also has a collection of pre Hispanic dolls/puppets with movable parts, including some from nearby Cacaxtla. The Huamantla Cultural Center is located next to the puppet museum, occupying the former priest's residence constructed between the 18th and 19th centuries. It has eight halls dedicated to various temporary exhibits and workshops. The Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum) is located in a building from the 18th century, next the city's bullring. The museum opened in 1981 after remodeling and today it hosts a collection of event posters from the 20th century, models of various bullrings in Mexico, matador outfits and photographs. Feria de Huamantla carpet laid out on the streets of the city The main cultural event of the year in Huamantla is the Feria de Huamantla (Huamantla Fair) which runs from 31 July to 21 August. Its origin is likely due to the worship of the goddess Xochiquetzal, goddess of love, flowers and arts. After the Conquest, the Spanish encouraged the veneration of the Virgin Mary instead. In the 17th century, the Franciscans built a hermitage to Our Lady of the Assumption. The image found here today has unknown origins but has since become associated with miracles. The feria attracts thousands of visitors from both Mexico and abroad. This image is better known as Our Lady of Charity (Virgen de la Caridad). There are two main events during the months, creation of ‚Äúcarpets‚Äù from colored sawdust, flowers and other materials and a running of the bulls called the Huamantlada. The carpets are made constantly in the atrium of this image's basilica and other churches from the 31 to the 15; however, 6 km of carpets are created on ‚Äúthe night no one sleeps,‚Äù that of August 14, working all night in preparation for the main procession with the image on August 15. Before the procession begins, the image is dressed in new robes and the image is followed by an entourage with candles and fireworks. The Huamantlada is held on August 19. The first event occurred in 1954 and has since grown in popularity. It is based on the running of the bulls in Pamplona and was originally called the ‚ÄúPamplonada‚Äù. The first run had seven bulls which has since grown in number to about twenty five. The running of the bulls is more dangerous as the animals are released into the streets from two directions. This event is the most famous of its kind in Mexico. During the month there are also donkey and car races, a children's version of running with the bulls, a parade with floats, a feria queen, a paella festival, cockfights, a chess tournament and the Festival International de T√≠teres Rosete Aranda. During this month and other traditional festivals one can see traditional dances such as Ketzalines, Vaqueros, Vasarios and Matlachines danced to bands playing wind instruments, and traditional dress, which is of Otomi origin. For men, it consists of white pants and a shirt, which is embroidered with figures and fretwork. For women it consists of a heavily embroidered colorful skirt, embroidered blouse and rebozo. Typical foods include mixiotes, barbacoa, mole with turkey, Tocatl√°n style chicken along with crystallized fruit and a dessert item called ‚Äúmu√©gano.‚Äù The municipality The city of Huamantla is the local governing authorities for surrounding communities, creating a municipality with a territory of 340.33 km2. This entity borders municipalities of Terrenate, Altzayanca, Ixtenco, Cuapiaxtla, Xaloztoc, San Jose Teacalco, Tetlanohcan, Tocatl√°n and Tzompantepec. The government consists of a president, a syndic and seven representatives called regidors. Outside of the city there are three main communities: Benito Ju√°rez with 3,150 inhabitants, Ignacio Zaragoza with 4,523 and San Jos√© Xocohtencatl with 3,899. All of these are rural communities with economies based on agriculture and livestock. In addition the municipality contains multiple haciendas, most of which have been broken up but some still in operation as private property. They include San Crist√≥bal Lagunas (established 18th century), El Balc√≥n (19th century), Santa Barbara (18th century), La Compa√±√≠a (17th century), Guadalupe (late 19th century), San Francisco Soltepec (18th century), San Diego Notario (18th century), San Mart√≠n Notario (18th century), El Molino (19th century), La Natividad (18th century), San Francisco Tecoac (19th century), San Miguel B√°ez (19th century), Santa Ana R√≠os (18th century), Santiago Brito (19th century), Santo Domingo (19th century), Xalpatlahuaya (18th century), San Antonio Atenco (late 19th century), Xonecuila (late 19th century) and San Pedro El Bat√°n (18th century). In the municipality, there are twenty one archeological sites. In the Santa Anita neighborhood of the city, there are pre Hispanic columns on private property. Geography and environment The municipality is located in the eastern half of the state of Tlaxcala, in the Central Mexican Highlands. It has an average altitude of 2,500 meters above sea level. The geography of the municipality has three types of relief. About twenty percent is rugged mountain (located in the far north and far south), about thirty percent is semi-flat (located I the north and south and over half which is flat, in the center. Its far south is part of the Malinche Volcano. The surface water of the area consists of small streams, most of which run only during the rainy season, running south to north. These have created ravines such as those called Tecoac, Xonemila, San Luca and Los Plares. Most of the water supply is from underground, accessed through 62 wells. The climate is semi dry and temperate. Most rain falls during the rainy season from May to September with an average annual rainfall of 119.3 mm. The warmest months are from March to May and the coldest in December and January. The average annual minimum is 5.4 ¬∞C and the average annual maximum is 23.2 ¬∞C. About thirty five percent of the municipality has wild vegetation, mostly near La Malinche. This vegetation varies by altitude with holm oak species prevalent in the lower elevations along with some pines and bushes. Above 2,800 meters, oyamel fir (Abies religiosa) and pines (Pinus hartwegii) can be found. Above 4,300 meters alpine grasslands and a juniper (Juniperus monticola) are found. In total, over sixty percent of the tree species are conifers and the rest are broad-leafed. Although most of the flat areas are used for cultivation and grazing, some wild species remain such as maguey (Agave horrida and Agave salmiana), sotol (Nolina longifolia), Yucca filifera, Senecio praecox, Opuntia hyticantha, Opuntia robusta and Mammilaria magnimamma. Wildlife is mostly found outside the urban area and includes rabbits (Silvilagus floridanus), hares (Lepus californicus), birds and reptiles. History The name comes from various Nahuatl words (cuahuitl (tree), man (next or in line) and tla (abundance)), which together are interpreted as place of aligned trees. Pre Hispanic period Portion of the Huamantla Codex The first settlement in the Huamantla area was south of the current city. It became one of thirteen villages which formed a political union that lasted from 1800 to 1200 BCE and at its height had a population of about 3,500 inhabitants. The village near Huamantla extended over an area of between three and five hectares. The next regional center of power was in a settlement which is now an archeological site called Los Cerritos de Natividad, east of Huamantla, whose influence extended over fourteen communities. This era is distinguished with the building of pyramid and planned urban centers. This was followed by the Texoloc era, with its center of power at Tlalencaleca between 800 and 600 BCE. Architecture included talud- tablero pyramids and ceramics which show influence from the west of Mexico and the Gulf coast. The following Tezoquipan era is considered to be the cultural and technological apex of the region reflected by its water system, architecture and trade connections. This era extended from 350 BCE to 100 CE, and at its height included 297 settlements, fourteen of which were major cities. What is now Huamantla was three of these settlements, with pyramids and planned layouts centered on a plaza. The decline of this area is called the Tenanyecac phase, which lasts from 100‚Äì650 CE. The decline is due to the rise of Teotihuacan and Cholula. People migrated away from the Tlaxcala area and eventually the zone became tributary provinces of the two powers. Teotihuacan established a trade corridor through Huamantla to connect it to points east and south, but no major settlements. Sometime after this, between 650 and 900 CE, there began Otomi migration into the Huamantla Valley and other parts of Tlaxcala in various waves. There is also evidence of Olmeca- Xicalanca and Tlaxco influence, with the rise of Cacaxtla. The fall of Teotihuacan allowed for local control of the trade corridor. However, from then until the colonial period, the major cultural force was Otomi. Much of this history is known from the Huamantla Codex, the largest document of its kind and one of the few that document the history of an Otomi people. It is in nine fragments, seven at the National Library of Anthropology and History in Mexico City and two in Germany at the Berlin State Library. The central story of the codex is a battle between newly arrived Otomis against those already established and aligned with Tlaxco at Atlangatepec. Victory went to the newcomers, allowing them passage and settlement near the Malinche Volcano, called the Tecoac dominion. These Tecoac Otomi were still a political force when the Spanish arrived. The document was likely commissioned shortly after the conquest, possibly by the Franciscans as the church and monastery of Huamantla are represented. The last indigenous consolidation of power in Huamantla was the creation of the Tlaxcallan dominion, from which the state gets its name. This was a Chichimeca political union that formed around 1100 CE, pushed out the Olmeca-Xilcalancas and divided the territory into four interdependent dominions. Otomi immigration still continued to the area after this, especially after the fall of Tula in 1168. Huamantla belonged to the dominion of Tecoac, one of the four that made up the Tlaxcallan kingdom. This area was first to have contact with Cort√©s and his army which made an incursion here in 1519 to be attacked, mostly by Otomi vassals. It was the first time the Spanish used their advanced weaponry and quickly dispersed the native soldiers. Colonial period Tlaxcala's role in the Conquest of Mexico allowed indigenous authorities to maintain a number of privileges with Spanish settlers. In 1528, an indigenous delegation went to Spain and one of their tasks was to solicit permission to found the settlement of Huamantla, with the name of San Luis Cuahmanco as the successor to Tzatl√°n, one of the indigenous power centers. Permission was granted in 1535, but Antonio de Mendoza ignored the royal seal and assigned lands here to Alonso Mu√±oz Camargo, Francisco Luca Garc√≠a, Eugenio Leal Chocolatzin, Diego Guevara and Juan de Aquino in the center of the new town as founders and outlying lands to forty other families between 1539 and 1543. The following monarch Phillip II disavowed the order. This prompted the Cabildo de Indios (Indian Council) to send an ambassador to Spain, with the Lienzo de Tlaxcala to remind the Crown of its obligations. Evangelization of the area was done by the Franciscans starting in 1524. The order began construction of the San Luis Obispo monastery in 1567 by Friar Pedro Mel√©ndez. It was completed in 1585 and replaced the ceremonial center of Tizatlan as the area's major religious center. This was followed by the establishment of school and eleven hermitages and churches around the city still found in the neighborhoods of El Calvario, La Trinidad, La Santa Cruz, San Miguel, San Juan, San Francisco, San Sebasti√°n, Santa Ana, San Antonio, La Caridad and San Diego. Huamantla quickly became the regional center for eastern Tlaxcala with an agricultural economy that converted the valley from forest to farmland by the end of the 16th century producing corn, wheat, sheep and more. Spanish incursion here was mostly due to the buying of land from indigenous authorities, but the labor supply on which these Spanish depended was mostly controlled by the Cabildo de Indios in the city of Tlaxcala. For this reason, the Spanish in Huamantla petitioned colonial authorities to divide the province, separating Huamantla from the city of Tlaxcala. However, in 1654, viceroy Duke of Albuquerque denied the petition. Despite this, Spanish landholdings continued to rise. Another tactic by the Spanish was to move control of parish churches from the Franciscan friars to regular clergy under the control of the bishop of Puebla in the mid 17th century. This was opposed by the Franciscans and caused instability as the regular priests did not speak Otomi and did not comply with promises to protect the indigenous against Spanish abuses. They also appropriated belongings of indigenous brotherhoods. Despite setbacks, indigenous authorities managed to maintain more influence here than in other parts of New Spain in keeping Spanish landholders in check. It even allowed the Cabildo in Tlaxcala to demand more influence over local authorities in Huamantla and even led to direct election of the mayor by the local, mostly indigenous, population in 1741. A second attempt to separate Huamantla from the city of Tlaxcala occurred in the second half of the 18th century, but this was also unsuccessful. However, during this time, the population became less indigenous in more influx of Spanish and criollos, lessening the influence of the Cabildo de Indios. Haciendas of the area consolidated. Those of Huamantla tended to be smaller but more productive because of the wetter climate and better soils. In 1785, colonial authorities integrated Tlaxcala as part of the province of Puebla, but this was reversed in 1793. At this time, Tlaxcala reorganized into seven ‚Äúcuarteles,‚Äù one of which being Huamantla, which included Cuapiaxtla, San Juan Ixtenco, San Nicol√°s Terrenate and San Pablo Zitlaltepec along with the city. Independence to 21st century View of Huamantla from San Lucas Bridge (1877) by Casimiro Castro In 1810, most of the indigenous population of the state supported the movement of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, but as the territory was surrounded by royalist Puebla, attempts to participate in the Mexican War of Independence were stifled. However, there were small insurrections in Huamantla as well as Tlaxco and Calpulalpan. In 1821, near the end of the war, Tlaxcalan authorities openly supported the Plan de Iguala. Huamantla gained municipality status in 1822, but shortly after, there was another effort to unite Tlaxcala with Puebla. Efforts to keep Tlaxcala an independent state were led by the parish priest of Huamantla, Miguel Valent√≠n, which eventually prevailed due to opposition to the empire model and in favor of a federal republic. The state proclaimed in 1846 was reorganized into three divisions, Tlaxcala, Tlaxco and Huamantla. In 1847 the city acquired the title of ‚Äúheroic‚Äù because of its participation in efforts against US invasion during the Mexican American War. During the Reform War, Huamantla the capital of Tlaxcala was briefly moved to Huamantla by Conservative forces in 1858 and the city was taken by the French in 1863. The capital moved back to the city of Tlaxcala after the ouster of the French. During the rest of the century the city grew with the construction of a railroad, which allowed haciendas to have access to markets in Mexico City as well as the states of Puebla, Hidalgo and Veracruz. Haciendas grew in number, size and power into the early 20th century, even takingover lands which had previously been communal and unilaterally restricting water supply to the city. As in the rest of Mexico, discontent with the Porfirio D√≠az regime grew as haciendas required employees to work from 4 am to 7 pm and paid them only in coupons good at the hacienda store. At the first sign of rebellion during the Mexican Revolution, the Porfirian governor of Tlaxcala dispatched troops to Huamantla and other places and was able to suppress early efforts such as that by Juan Cuamatzi, who was executed on February 26, 1911. Soon after the mayor of Huamantla along with others resigned his position. Later, the San Diego del Pinar Hacienda in the municipality was attacked by Zapatistas in 1913 and then later the same year by rebels fleeing the federal army. The second attacked was repelled by the hacienda. In that same year the first revolutionary troops took control of the city. After the Revolution ended, Huamantla grew again adding commerce and industry to its economy. In the 1940s, the first modern factories were built, making powdered milk and cream, cookies pork cold cuts, fertilizer and mole. These were followed by various others producing clothing and other textiles. Telephone service was established in 1932. Media channels were also established such as newspapers and radio station XEHT, which still operates. The first flights to the city occurred in 1953. The city has since grown to include sprawling suburbs. In 2007, the city was named a ‚ÄúPueblo M√°gico‚Äù by the Mexican government's tourism secretariat, in part because of its celebrations to the Virgin of Charity and the Huamantlada in August. To achieve the designation, it also renovated much of its downtown, especially Parque Ju√°rez. Economy The municipality's economy is still heavily agricultural, with almost a third of its workforce dedicated to crops and livestock. Another third works in mining and industry (including handcrafts) and the last third in commerce and services. Over half of the municipality's territory is used for farming and grazing but agriculture's role has been diminishing. In 2009, the municipality had 24,424 hectares under cultivation with crops such as corn, beans, wheat, animal feed, peaches and rye. Livestock includes cattle (mostly dairy), pigs, sheep, goats and domestic fowl. There are thirteen major industrial sites mostly producing food products. Other facilities include those making metal products, pharmaceuticals, plastic and leather goods. Traditional crafts include amate paper, mostly done by the Otomis, along with pottery, textiles, masks and dolls make from dried corn husks. Commerce and services is the fastest-growing sector of the economy. The city is the starting point for a tourist route called ‚ÄúHuamantla and the East.‚Äù The municipality has 153.1 km of highways mostly secondary and rural roads. Education The municipality has 163 schools from preschool to college level. Most are public schools with 29 being private. College level institutions include the Universidad Tecnol√≥gical del Tlaxcala and the Instituto Franciscano de Oriente. There is also a campus of the Universidad Popular Aut√≥noma del Estado de Puebla which provides high school and college level education. The municipality has an illiteracy rate of about eight percent, above the state average of 6.7 percent.

The Wedge Strategy is a creationist political and social action plan authored by the Discovery Institute, the hub of the pseudoscientific intelligent design movement.

The strategy was originally brought to the public's attention when the Wedge Document was leaked on the Web. The Wedge strategy forms the governing basis of a wide range of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns. Overview The Wedge Document outlines a public relations campaign meant to sway the opinion of the public, popular media, charitable funding agencies, and public policy makers. The document sets forth the short-term and long-term goals with milestones for the intelligent design movement, with its governing goals stated in the opening paragraph: * \\"To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\\" * \\"To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God\\" There are three Wedge Projects, referred to in the strategy as three phases designed to reach a governing goal: * Scientific Research, Writing, and Publicity * Publicity and Opinion-making * Cultural Confrontation & Renewal Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms the strategy's Christian, evangelistic orientation: The wedge strategy was designed with both five-year and twenty-year goals in mind in order to achieve the conversion of the mainstream. One notable component of the work was its desire to address perceived social consequences and to promote a social conservative agenda on a wide range of issues including abortion, euthanasia, sexuality, and other social reform movements. It criticized \\"materialist reformers [who] advocated coercive government programs\\" which it referred to as \\"a virulent strain of utopianism\\". Beyond promotion of the Phase I goals of proposing Intelligent Design-related research, publications, and attempted integration into academia, the wedge strategy places an emphasis on Phases II and III advocacy aimed at increasing popular support of the Discovery Institute's ideas. Support for the creation of popular-level books, newspaper and magazine articles, op-ed pieces, video productions, and apologetics seminars was hoped to embolden believers and sway the broader culture towards acceptance of intelligent design. This, in turn, would lead the ultimate goal of the wedge strategy; a social and political reformation of American culture. In 20 years, the group hopes that they will have achieved their goal of making intelligent design the main perspective in science as well as to branch out to ethics, politics, philosophy, theology, and the fine arts. A goal of the wedge strategy is to see intelligent design \\"permeate religious, cultural, moral and political life.\\" By accomplishing this goal the ultimate goal as stated by the Center for Science and Culture (CSC) of the \\"overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural legacies\\" and reinstating the idea that humans are made in the image of God, thereby reforming American culture to reflect conservative Christian values, will be achieved. The preamble of the Wedge DocumentThe Wedge Strategy - Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture is mirrored largely word-for-word in the early mission statement of the CSC, then called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. The theme is again picked up in the controversial book From Darwin to Hitler authored by Center for Science and Culture Fellow Richard Weikart and published with the center's assistance.From Darwin to Hitler webpage, published under the banner of the CSC and the Discovery Institute The wedge strategy was largely authored by Phillip E. Johnson, and features in his book The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism.

The Institute still seeks to downplay its significance, saying \\"Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the 'Wedge' document\\"., Discovery Institute staff, February 3, 2006 The Institute also portrays the scientific community's reaction to the Wedge document as driven by \\"Darwinist Paranoia.\\"The \\"Wedge Document\\": How Darwinist Paranoia Fueled an Urban Legend Discovery Institute staff, July, 2005. Despite insisting that intelligent design is not a form of creationism, the Discovery Institute chose to use an image of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, depicting God reaching out to impart life from his finger into Adam. Movement and strategy According to Phillip E. Johnson, the wedge movement, if not the term, began in 1992: In 1993, a year after the SMU conference, \\"the Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars met at Pajaro Dunes. Here, Behe presented for the first time the seed thoughts that had been brewing in his mind for a year--the idea of 'irreducibly complex' molecular machinery.\\"Meeting Darwin's Wager Christianity Today Magazine.

Pennock, p8 Nancy Pearcey, a CSC fellow, and Johnson associate acknowledges Johnson's leadership of the intelligent design movement in two of her most recent publications. In an interview with Johnson for World magazine, Pearcey says, \\"It is not only in politics that leaders forge movements. Phillip Johnson has developed what is called the 'Intelligent Design' movement.\\"Wedge Issues, Phillip Johnson Interview, July 29, 2000.World Magazine: Pearcey, Nancy In Christianity Today, she reveals Johnson's religious beliefs and his animosity toward evolution and affirms Johnson as \\"The unofficial spokesman for ID.\\"Access Research Network in the WindowView In his 1997 book Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds Johnson summed up the underlying philosophy of the strategy: At the 1999 \\"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference\\" called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Johnson gave a speech called How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won. In it he summed up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for winning the battle: Johnson cites the foundation of intelligent design as The Gospel According to Saint John, in the New Testament, specifically, Chapter 1:1: \\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\\" (King James Version). The 1999 establishment of the Michael Polanyi Center at Baylor University by Baylor president Robert B. Sloan was a major step forward in the Wedge Strategy. The center was directed by William Dembski and Bruce L. Gordon, with funding from the John Templeton Foundation via the Discovery Institute. The center was disbanded the next year in the face of protests from Baylor's faculty and the recommendation of an outside advisory council. By 2005 Baylor had also hired two other wedge proponents, Walter Bradley and Francis J. Beckwith. Elaborating on the goals and methods of wedge strategy, Johnson stated in an interview conducted in 2002 for Touchstone Magazine that \\"The mechanism of the wedge strategy is to make it attractive to Catholics, Orthodox, non- fundamentalist Protestants, observant Jews, and so on.\\" He went on to elaborate: Other statements of Johnson's acknowledge that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic and creationist agenda cast as a scientific concept. Critics claim that Johnson's statements validate claims leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping religious content from their anti- evolution, creationist assertions as a means of avoiding the separation of church and state mandated by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, page 138 The statements, when viewed in the light of the Wedge document and the US District Court's Kitzmiller decision, show ID and the ID movement is an attempt to put a gloss of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, page 29 The wedge strategy details a simultaneous assault on state boards of education, state and federal legislatures and on the print and broadcast media.\\"Alongside a focus on the influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. Well, will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidence that support the faith, as well as \\"popularize\\" our ideas in the broader culture.\\" The Wedge Strategy Discovery Institute, Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. 1998 (PDF file) The Discovery Institute has carried out the strategy through its role in the intelligent design movement, where it aggressively promoted ID and its Teach the Controversy campaign to the public, education officials and public policymakers.. A publication of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Intelligent design proponents, through the Discovery Institute, have employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in their furtherance of their goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents.Seattle Times.

This is made with the knowledge that it's unlikely many in the public understand advanced biology or can consult the current scientific literature or contact major scientific organizations to verify Discovery Institute claims. This part of the strategy also plays on undercurrents of anti-intellectualism and distrust of science and scientists that can be found in particular segments of American society.\\"some hair-splitting that could only look ridiculous to outsider observers.\\" What looks to scientists to be a very compelling rebuttal to Dembski's arguments made by Dr. Schneider is portrayed to non-scientists, and especially the public, as \\"ridiculous hair-splitting\\" Dealing with the Backlash Against Intelligent Design William A.

But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their \\"natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians,\\" ID proponents express themselves in unambiguously religious language. This in the belief that they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as Howard Ahmanson. Having written extensively about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says \\"When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about the identity of the designer.

Cohen, The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa, p.342, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London, University of California Press, 2006, . According to Strabo (16.4.7), Ptolemais was founded as a base to support the hunting of elephants by a certain Eumedes (), who had been sent there by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, king of Ptolemaic Egypt. Eumedes, \\"secretly enclosed a kind of peninsula with a ditch and a wall, and then, by courteous treatment of those who tried to hinder the work, actually won them over as friends instead of foes.\\" (Strabo 16.4.7). Ptolemais was only one of a series of such elephant-hunting stations along the Red Sea coast of Africa, Adulis being perhaps originally another. Pliny the Elder (2.75.1)Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 2.75.1 and Diodorus Siculus (3.41.1)Diodorus Siculus, Library, 3.41.1 also mention the hunting of the elephants. The early Ptolemies had seen the value of war elephants by the military strength of the Seleucids. Cut off from any possibility of acquiring Indian elephants, they founded and actively sought to capture them from the neighboring regions of Africa. Although these animals helped in the Battle of Raphia, they proved unstable and the African species were intimidated by the Asian species, which led to the Egyptians eventually abandoning the use of these animals in war. Unlike most of the stations the Ptolemies established to the south of their kingdom, Ptolemais had enough fertile land immediately around it to sustain it as a town. By the time the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea was written (mid 1st century), it had clearly declined in importance. The writer notes that it had \\"no harbor, and can only be reached by small boats\\" (ch. 3).Huntingford, G. W. B. 1980. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea - by an unknown author; with some extracts from Agatharkhides \\"On the Erythraean Sea\\". Vol. 151, Works issued by the Hakluyt Society. Second series. London: Hakluyt Society. Ancient authorities are vague on the location of Ptolemais, and the site remains unidentified. The Periplus describes it as 3000 stadia south of the Moskhophagoi, and 4000 stadia north of Adulis, inside the regions ruled by Zoskales, the king of Aksum; Pliny the Elder (N.H. 6.168) notes that Ptolemais was close to Lake Monoleus. G.W.B. Huntingford notes that Ptolemais has been identified both with the locales of Arqiqo and Suakin some 150 miles apart, and notes that Suakin lay at the end of an ancient caravan route that links it to Barbar on the Nile. However, Stanley M. Burstein argues for Trinkitat, where he states that \\"classical architectural fragments\\" have been found.Stanley M. Burstein, Agatharchides of Cnidus, On the Erythraean Sea, p.144 n.2. (London: the Hakluyt Society, 1989).

Biography =Early years Whitten was born on May 8, 1943, in Columbus, Georgia. His parents split up when he was young. He and his sister, Brenda, lived with their mother, who worked long hours as a waitress. His mother remarried when he was 9 and the family moved to Canton, Ohio. Musical beginnings Whitten joined Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina among others in the doo-wop group Danny and the Memories. After recording an obscure single, \\"Can't Help Loving That Girl of Mine\\", core members of the group moved to San Francisco where they morphed into a folk- psychedelic rock act called The Psyrcle. Whitten played guitar, Molina drums, and Talbot played bass and piano. By 1967, the group took on brothers George and Leon Whitsell on additional guitars and vocals, as well as violinist Bobby Notkoff, the sextet calling themselves The Rockets. They signed with independent label White Whale Records, working with producer Barry Goldberg for the group's self-titled album in mid-1968. The album sold poorly. Connection with Neil Young Songwriter Neil Young, fresh from departing Buffalo Springfield, with one album of his own under his belt, began jamming with the Rockets and expressed interest in recording with Whitten, Molina and Talbot. The trio agreed, so long as they were allowed to simultaneously continue on with The Rockets. Young acquiesced initially, but imposed a rehearsal schedule that made that an impossibility. At first dubbed \\"War Babies\\" by Young, they soon became known as Crazy Horse. Recording sessions led to Young's second album, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, credited as Neil Young with Crazy Horse, with Whitten on second guitar and vocals. Although his role was that of support, Whitten sang the album's opening track \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" along with Young, and Whitten and Young shared lead guitar on \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\". These tracks would influence the grunge movement of the 1990s, and all three songs remain part of Young's performance repertoire. Drug addiction During this period, Whitten began using heroin; after finding that it mitigated his longstanding battle with rheumatoid arthritis, he quickly became addicted. Although he participated in the early stages of Young's next solo effort, After the Gold Rush, Whitten and the rest of Crazy Horse were dismissed about halfway through the recording sessions, in part because of Whitten's heavy drug use. Whitten performs guitar and vocals on \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\", \\"I Believe in You\\", and \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\". He was also brought in at the end of the sessions to provide harmony vocals on \\"Tell Me Why\\", \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\", \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\", \\"Southern Man\\" and \\"Till the Morning Comes\\". Young wrote \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" during this time, with direct references to Whitten's addiction and its role in the destruction of his talent. Acquiring a recording contract and expanded to a quintet in 1970, Crazy Horse recorded its first group-only album, released in early 1971. The debut album included five songs by Whitten, with two standout tracks being a song co-written by Young which would show up later on a Young album, \\"(Come On Baby Let's Go) Downtown\\", and Whitten's most famous composition, \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\", a heartfelt ballad that would receive many cover versions and offer the promise of unfulfilled talent. Death Whitten continued to drift, his personal life ruled almost totally by drugs. He was kicked out of Crazy Horse by Talbot and Molina, who used replacements on the band's two albums of 1972. In April of that year, after receiving a call from Young to play rhythm guitar on the upcoming tour behind Young's Harvest album, Whitten showed up for rehearsals at Young's home outside San Francisco. While the rest of the group hammered out arrangements, Whitten lagged behind, figuring out the rhythm parts, though never in sync with the rest of the group. Young, who had more at stake after the success of After The Gold Rush and Harvest, fired him from the band on November 18, 1972. Young gave Whitten $50 and a plane ticket back to Los Angeles. Later that night Whitten died from ingesting a combination of diazepam, which he was taking for severe knee arthritis, and alcohol, which he was using to try to get over his heroin addiction. In 1973, Charles Perry of Rolling Stone reported that Whitten died of a methaqualone overdose. Neil Young recalled, \\"We were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me and told me he'd died. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\\"Quoted in Heatley, Michael (1997). Neil Young: In His Own Words, p. 27. Omnibus Press, Years later, Young told biographer Jimmy McDonough that for a long time after Whitten died, he felt responsible for Whitten's death. It took him years to stop blaming himself. \\"Danny just wasn't happy\\", Young said. \\"It just all came down on him. He was engulfed by this drug. That was too bad. Because Danny had a lot to give, boy. He was really good.\\" Discography * \\"Surfin' Granny' (A-Side), \\"Mirror Mirror\\" (B-Side), Danny & The Memories, Single, Liberty label, 1963 (Not Released) * \\"Can't Help Loving That Girl of Mine\\" (A-Side), \\"Don't Go\\" (B-Side), Danny & The Memories, Single, Valiant label, 7/64; re-released 3/65 * \\"Baby, Don't Do That\\" (A-Side), (B-Side is unknown), The Psyrcle, Single, Lorna label, 1966 (Not Released) * The Rockets, The Rockets, Album, White Whale label, 1968 * \\"Hole In My Pocket\\" (A-side), \\"Let Me Go\\" (B-Side), The Rockets, Single, White Whale label, 1968 * \\"Hole In My Pocket\\" (A & B-Sides), The Rockets, Single, White Whale label, 1968 (Promotional/radio release only) * \\"Let Me Go\\" (A & B-Sides), The Rockets, Single, White Whale label, 1968 (Promotional/radio release only) * Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Neil Young & Crazy Horse, Album, Reprise label, 1969 * After the Gold Rush, Neil Young, Album, Reprise label, 1970 * Crazy Horse, Crazy Horse, Album, Reprise label, 1971 * \\"Downtown\\" (A-Side), \\"Crow Jane Lady\\" (B-Side), Crazy Horse, Single, Reprise label, 1971 * \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" (A-Side), \\"Carolay\\" (B-Side), Crazy Horse, Single, Reprise label, 1971 * \\"Dirty, Dirty\\" (A-Side), \\"Beggar's Day\\" (B-Side), Crazy Horse, Single, Reprise label 1971 * Tonight's the Night, Neil Young, Album, Reprise, 1975 (recorded 1970, posthumously released) * Gone Dead Train: The Best of Crazy Horse 1971‚Äì1989 Crazy Horse, Album, Raven label, 2005 * Scratchy: The Complete Reprise Recordings, Crazy Horse, Album, Rhino Handmade label, 2005 * Live at the Fillmore East, Neil Young & Crazy Horse, Album, Reprise, 2006 (recorded 1970) Songs written by Danny Whitten * \\"Baby, Don't Do That\\" (Whitten, Billy Talbot) 1966 Lorna single, produced by Sly Stone * \\"Dance To The Music On The Radio\\" (Whitten, Talbot) * \\"Dirty, Dirty\\" (Whitten) * \\"(Come On Baby Let's Go) Downtown\\" (Whitten, Neil Young) * \\"Hole in My Pocket\\" (Whitten) 1968 White Whale single, produced by Barry Goldberg; also recorded by the 'Barry Goldberg Reunion' on There's No Hole In My Soul for Buddah Records. * \\"I Don't Need Nobody (Hangin' Round My Door)\\" (Whitten) * \\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\\" (Whitten) * \\"I'll Get By\\" (Whitten) * \\"Let Me Go\\" (Whitten) 1968 White Whale single, produced by Barry Goldberg. * \\"Look At All The Things\\" (Whitten) * \\"Love Can Be So Bad\\" (Whitten, Lolly Vegas) * \\"May\\" (Whitten, Talbot) * \\"Mr. Chips\\" (Whitten) * \\"Oh Boy\\" (Whitten) * \\"Wasted\\" (Whitten, Lolly Vegas, Pat Vegas) * \\"Whatever\\" (Whitten, Talbot) * \\"Won't You Say You'll Stay\\" (Whitten) See also * Crazy Horse (band) ReferencesExternal links * * Archived Danny Whitten website at the Internet Archive Category:1943 births Category:1972 deaths Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:Musicians from Columbus, Georgia Category:Crazy Horse (band) members Category:20th-century American musicians Category:American songwriters Category:American male singers Category:Lead guitarists Category:Rhythm guitarists Category:Drug-related deaths in California Category:Alcohol-related deaths in California Category:Guitarists from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:20th-century American guitarists ","title":"Danny Whitten"},{"id":"1515993","text":"Heat coils, also known as protectors, bugs or carbons serve as a surge protector between the telephone exchange and outside plant. They are commonly the last point of appearance for a telephone circuit before it leaves the office, for example on the outside plant side of the main distribution frame. On some competitive local exchange carrier circuits there are two heat coils, the extra one being at the point of interface between their circuit and where the incumbent local exchange carrier or Regional Bell Operating Company receives it. Their primary purpose is to protect central office equipment from surges of high voltage. If a surge comes down the line it will melt the connection between the central office and outside plant sides, as in a fuse, thereby protecting the equipment. Some heat coils have springs in them, so that when a surge breaks the circuit their tension is released and the plastic cover pops off as a visual indicator that the line is somehow defective.

Models in the V series include the CTS-V coupe, sedan and wagon. Cadillac reportedly has no plans to create V-series versions of its crossovers, the , XT4, XT5 and XT6. However, multiple reports have stated that Cadillac's largest SUV, the Escalade, may receive a \\"V\\" variant for the new fifth generation, due in 2021. Second-generation Cadillac CTS-V Sedan Most V-series Cadillacs feature high-performance V8 engines mated to manual six- speed transmissions or automatic transmissions in the STS-V, XLR-V ATS-V and 2009+CTS-V, top-of-the-line Brembo brakes and revised suspension systems, revised interiors and special V-series bodywork which is intended to improve vehicle performance as well as differentiate them from their normal production counterparts. Cadillac has also re-entered Motorsport competition with their CTS-V R, a joint venture between GM Performance Division and Pratt & Miller race team, most famous for their role in GM's Le Mans-winning Corvette C5-R program. In addition to the Corvette and Camaro, the V designation draws comparisons to other high-performance models by GM such as the Super Sport series, Chrysler's SRT, and Ford SVT line of high-performance vehicles. In 2009, the second-generation CTS-V sedan achieved a lap time of 7:59.32 at the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife, which was the fastest documented time for a production sedan on factory tires‚Äîuntil the Porsche Panamera Turbo clocked a time of 7:56 in July 2009‚Äîthanks to a heavily-tuned \\"LS9\\" EATON-supercharged V8 engine that was borrowed from Corvette. The engine was renamed as \\"LSA\\" and it produces 556 horsepower as well of torque. The same \\"LSA\\" engine is used in CTS-V coupe and wagon. The CTS-V is the only V-series Cadillac for the 2014 model lineup, and it was originally created to compete with BMW M3 sedan and coupe, as well the M5. Future plans for the V series include a new ATS-V sedanATS-V sedan and coupecoupe along with a third-generation CTS-V sedan.3rd generation CTS-V sedan First-generation V series First-generation Cadillac CTS-V The first V-series model of the Cadillac family was the CTS, which was built on GM Sigma Platform like the core model. Since a V8 engine was used, it required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti- roll bars and larger shocks were also added. The spring rate was significantly increased. Right at front above the ground, GM LS engine V8 from the C5-generation Corvette Z06 was fitted and coupled‚Äîalso from the C5 Z06‚Äîwith a six-speed Tremec manual transmission. Cadillac XLR-V XLR hard-top was the second Cadillac to join the V series. It was an ultra-luxury segment car, first introduced in 2005 and it shared platform with Chevrolet Corvette (C6). The XLR-V used a supercharged Northstar engine series. For the XLR-V, the engine was certified by the SAE to produce 443 hp (330 kW) and 414 lb¬∑ft (561 N¬∑m). The supercharger and four intercoolers were built into the intake manifold. A six-speed automatic transmission, larger brakes from the Z51 Corvette, and 19-inch wheels were used. The XLR base price was $98,000 and by 2008 it reached $101,300 making it one of General Motors' most expensive vehicles of all time. Cadillac STS-V A year after XLR-V launch and two after CTS-V, in 2006, Cadillac started producing STS-V sedan that also featured the famous Northstar V8 engine from XLR-V. However, the supercharged Northstar V8 in STS-V had 26 more horsepower and 25 more lb-ft of torque than XLR-V's. The engine was mated to a driver-adjustable transmission with two shifting modes, larger brakes by Brembo, larger ten-spoke alloy wheels (18 in √ó 8.5\\" front, 19 in √ó 9.5\\" rear), Pirelli run-flat tires, a faster steering ratio, and a stiffer suspension than the standard STS. Second-generation V series 2nd generation Cadillac CTS-V sedan The second-generation V series was exclusive to the CTS since STS and XLR were rolled out of production. For 2009, Cadillac introduced the second-generation CTS-V that was built on GM Sigma II Platform. It was a rear-wheel drive, powered by a LSA EATON-supercharged V8 that was based on LS9 V8 from‚Äîwhat was then‚Äîrecently released Corvette ZR1. The engine generates 556 horsepower and 551 lb-ft of torque. The second-generation CTS-V was a major hit that advanced Cadillac's \\"Art & Science\\" philosophy further ahead. It broke a N√ºrburgring lap-record which made it‚Äîback then‚Äîthe fastest production sedan. Second-generation Cadillac CTS-V wagon When asked in 2009 about the possibility of a CTS-V wagon, the GM Vice Chairman at that time, Bob Lutz, replied, \\"... should sufficient demand materialize, there is no reason why we couldn't do a V-series wagon, and I would be standing in line for one, just ahead of you.\\" GM decided to move forward, introducing a 5-door sport wagon body style to the CTS-V vehicle line at the New York International Auto Show on March 29, 2010. The CTS-V wagon shares the 556 hp (415 kW) engine and six-speed manual or automatic transmission, Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo brakes, 19-inch aluminum wheels and performance tires and a dual-airflow grille also used in the CTS-V sedan and coupe. The CTS-V coupe debuted at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and entered production in summer 2010 as a 2011 model. It has the same 556 hp (415 kW) engine and transmission choices as the CTS-V sedan. The CTS-V Coupe features unique centered twin exhausts, a larger grille for air intake, and an optional \\"saffron\\" interior trim color. Like the CTS-V sedan, it comes standard with 19-inch aluminum wheels, Brembo brakes, and Magnetic Ride Control. Third- generation V series Third generation Cadillac CTS-V Cadillac ATS-V The third generation CTS-V includes a 6.2 litre 640 hp LT4 supercharged gasoline V8 engine, as the most powerful Cadillac ever produced to date. The third generation CTS-V is sometimes referred to as a four-door Corvette, because of its supercharged V8 from the Corvette C7 Z06 and a top speed of 200 miles per hour. It weighs 4145 pounds. The new 2016 Cadillac CTS-V model equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission has been street tested with a best 0-60 MPH test time of 3.6 seconds.[20] Vsport Starting with XTS, the marque offers a step trim, called Vsport. The Vsport trim is the top of the XTS line, with a turbocharged engine, producing . The next year, the third generation CTS was started to being offered with a Vsport trimline, however with an increased output of . Both of them were the only \\"V\\"-badged vehicles of Cadillac until announcement of CTS-V and ATS-V. The V-Sport trim designation was discontinued with the CTS and XTS sedan phase-outs in 2019 and 2020, respectively. CTS-V The CTS-V continues the V8 engine tradition of V series, now with a LT4 engine shared with the Chevrolet Corvette (C7) Z06, producing and , as the most powerful Cadillac ever produced till date. It weighs and its top speed is . It will be released as a 2016 model, along with smaller ATS-V. The third-generation CTS-V is set to rival the Mercedes-Benz E-63 AMG along with the BMW M5. It was discontinued with the CTS line in 2019. ATS-V The Cadillac ATS-V is intended to compete against BMW M4/BMW M3 and Audi RS4. The ATS-V is the first V6-engined V series of Cadillac ever, with a LF4 engine that produces 464 hp and 445 lb ft. The ATS-V was discontinued with the ATS line in 2019. Fourth-generation V series Cadillac CT6-V Cadillac CT5-V Cadillac CT4-V The fourth generation V series was the first to incorporate Cadillac's new \\"Escala\\" design language with the all-new Cadillac CT6-V in 2020. This began a new era for the V series, in that none of the three all-new V series sedans, the CT6-V, the CT5-V, nor the CT4-V, were available with a pushrod General Motors small-block V8 engine. The CT6-V made use of Cadillac's all-new Blackwing V8, while the CT5-V used GM's 3-liter twin-turbo LGY V6, and the CT4-V a 2.7 liter turbo inline 4-cylinder engine. This generation also marked the beginning of a new V series trim strategy, where the \\"V\\" trims would become the entry-level performance variants (a position previously held by the V-Sport trim level), and a new, higher V series trim would mark the high-power, hard-core performance variant, previously denoted by the straight \\"V.\\" The higher-output CT5-V and CT4-V variants have been rumored to come equipped with the LT4 supercharged V8 and 3.6 High-Feature twin-turbo V6, respectively, and both will offer automatic and manual transmissions.

His major literary work was the Dictionary of Russian Authors, which he worked on for decades. He travelled extensively in Europe to find books and manuscripts needed for this work. He was also interested in the letters of Voltaire and in Franco-Russian cultural relations. He wrote articles for the French press on these and other literary topics, often under the pseudonym R.E. According to Yuri Druzhnikov, Poltoratzky was the first to introduce Pushkin's work to a western European audience, in the October 1821 issue of Revue encyclopedique (published in Paris). Among Poltoratzky's literary friends were Victor Hugo, Nikolay Karamzin, Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert, Alexander Pushkin, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Vasiliy Zhukovsky. He was also known for giving financial help to impoverished authors and scholars. Poltoratzky's personal library, which included many rare books and unpublished manuscripts, was donated to the Imperial Public Library, now the Russian State Library. Life Serge Poltoratzky was the only son of Dimitry Poltoratzky and Anna Khlebnikova, who also had five daughters. Serge was primarily educated by tutors at the family home, Avchurino, on the east bank of the Oka River in Kaluga Province (Kaluzhskaya Oblast), but he also spent a year at the Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa. His parents were deeply interested in improving the material and social conditions of Russian serfs and peasants, and Serge inherited their commitment. In 1812 the family hid in Avchurino's attics as Napoleon‚Äôs army looted the estate during their retreat from Moscow. Serge came into his inheritance at the age of 15, when his father died in 1818. At this time Serge was serving at court as a page to the Tsarina Elizaveta, wife of Tsar Alexander I. He later served in the Preobrazhensky Life Guards, according to his father‚Äôs and uncles‚Äô wishes, but military life was not to his liking, and he soon resigned his commission, having reached only the lowly rank of praporshchik (often translated as ‚Äúensign‚Äù). Thereafter he devoted himself primarily to literary pursuits. Druzhnikov relates that after Poltoratzky's 1921 article, which mentioned Pushkin's poems Liberty and The Village and their criticism of Russian social conditions, appeared in France, he \\"was fired from his job and sent to live in the country under police supervision\\". This job may have been the Life Guards position, and the episode glossed for his children as a voluntary resignation. Poltoratzky was one of the wealthiest men in Russia. He owned seven large estates, at least two houses in Moscow, and various smaller properties and investments. All this wealth had been accumulated in a mere two generations, as both his grandfathers were commoners ennobled to the rank of potomstvenniy dvorianin (hereditary untitled gentleman), Piotr Khlebnikov for service to Russian literature, and Mark Poltoratzky for his singing voice. All Serge Poltoratzky's paternal uncles married into the titled nobility. His only aunt married Alexey Olenin, the first director of the Russian Imperial Library. His mother's brother emigrated to the US, and the family lost touch with him during the 1796-1801 reign of Tsar Pavel I, who banned all foreign correspondence. Poltoratzky married in 1831, but within a few years his wife mysteriously disappeared, having been last seen leaving their Moscow house on foot. In 1843 he became engaged to Ellen Sarah Southee, 16 years his junior, and the daughter of an English gentleman farmer. She was related to poet Robert Southey. Later that year Poltoratzky's first wife was legally declared dead, his mother died, and his second marriage took place. From 1843 Poltoratzky made his home at Avchurino when not engaged in literary travels. There he and his wife had three daughters and two sons, the eldest of whom died in infancy. After the accession of the reform-minded Tsar Alexander II in 1855, many of the legal impediments to landowners‚Äô freeing their serfs were removed. Poltoratzky took advantage of these changes to free his thousands of serfs between the years 1856 and 1859. In addition, he gave them land, livestock, tools and other goods to help them become self-supporting. He also advised the Tsar's Emancipation Committee, which was developing the terms of serf emancipation that would be enacted in 1861. In 1859 Poltoratzky discovered that two of his estate managers had massively defrauded him. The men were tried and convicted, which might have enabled Poltoratzky to gain legal redress from the debts incurred on his behalf, but he did not pursue this possibility. Around the same time it became known to the imperial government that Poltoratzky's English wife had never converted to the Russian Orthodox church, and furthermore, that their children were being raised in the Anglican church. While this was perhaps technically legal, so soon after the Crimean War it was utterly unacceptable socially, and in imperial Russia, social-political favor would have been essential to the family's economic recovery. Poltoratzky liquidated his assets in Russia, paid off his debts, and prepared to emigrate to France, where he had some untouched funds. In 1860 the Poltoratzky family left Russia for good. They went first to Charlottenburg, Prussia, where another son was born. They then proceeded to Paris, where Serge had long maintained a pied-√†-terre for use on his literary trips. Thereafter the family divided their time between Paris and England, where the youngest son was born. Death Poltoratzky died in Neuilly, France in 1884. Notable Descendants Serge Poltoratzky's literary legacy was continued by his daughter Frances Hermione de Poltoratzky (alternate spellings: Poltoratskaia or Poltoratskaya), 1850-1916. She wrote, primarily in French, novels, pamphlets on social and political issues, and works on Russian history. The next generation's author was E. M. Almedingen, the daughter of Hermione's sister Olga. Almedingen wrote histories, memoirs, poems and novels for both adults and children. Her most successful works were several novelized children's biographies of her ancestors.  References  * Almedingen, E.M. Anna London: Oxford University Press, 1972 * Almedingen, E.M.

WOXY placed in the Rolling Stone reader's poll \\"best radio station\\" category four times between 1990 and 1995. Rolling Stone also recognized WOXY as one of ten \\"stations that don't suck\\" in 1998 and one of four \\"last great independent\\" radio stations in 2003.Bishop, Lauren. \\"97X farewell\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer May 10, 2004 Webcast (1998‚Äì2010) In 1998, WOXY began to experiment with webcasts, and listeners tuned in from around the world; the Internet listenership continued to grow. The station continued to broadcast online while building a website with message boards and information to create a community of modern rock. The station was also one of a number of stations offered in the Internet radio section of iTunes. End of FM broadcast In January 2004, the Baloghs sold the license to 97.7 FM to Dallas, Texas-based First Broadcasting Investment Partners for $5.6 million but retained the station's music library and 97X brand with the intention of continuing broadcasting as internet-only WOXY.com. 97X ended its terrestrial broadcasting on 97.7 FM on May 13, 2004.Eckberg, John. \\"97X web station returns, thanks to pair of investors\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, June 17, 2004. The future of \\"The Future of Rock and Roll\\" was to be on the Internet, broadcasting exclusively from the WOXY.com website. The staff committed to staying with the WOXY.com venture worked feverishly over the following five months to secure funding and advertisers for what was at the time an unheard of business venture; an Internet-only commercial radio station. However, appropriate funding for the transition did not initially appear, so the station was forced to shut down operations on Thursday, May 13, 2004 and terminate its broadcast, not only via its 97.7 FM transmission, but also via WOXY.com. WOXY.com (2004‚Äì2010)=Background One day after 97X left the FM airwaves, on Friday, May 14, 2004, representatives of anonymous angel investors contacted the station staff, intent on funding the WOXY.com venture. After two months of legalities, on July 12, 2004, \\"The Future of Rock and Roll\\" resumed its WOXY.com broadcast. As a subtle nod to its 1983 FM debut (\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" by the Irish band U2), the first song played on the resumed WOXY.com broadcast was \\"Orpheus\\" by the Irish alternative rock band Ash. Because of the nature of the 97.7 FM sale to First Broadcasting out of Texas, \\"The Future of Rock & Roll\\" was able to continue broadcasting from the Oxford, Ohio building until a more touring musician friendly location could be found. In September 2004, WOXY.com operations were relocated to Cincinnati's Longworth Hall, a building at the intersection of three interstate highways and close to multiple concert venues. Publicity To herald its return to broadcasting, \\"The Future of Rock & Roll\\" relied on a viral campaign to be carried out by its loyal listeners. WOXY provided via its website, avatars, banners, buttons, PDF files, etc., all with the intention of getting the word out; \\"The Future of Rock & Roll\\" is back! The station also purchased some well placed ads in music oriented magazines. Programming The internet definitely allowed for more programming avenues and outlets than standard FM radio ever did. \\"The Future of Rock and Roll\\" continued to find innovative ways to program the station. *BAM! Modern Rock: Even with a new engine driving the music, \\"The Future of Rock and Roll\\" remained true to its roots; real DJs programming the music they choose from the Modern Rock library they have been building upon since the beginning. *WOXY Lounge Acts *WOXY Vintage: In 2005, \\"The Future of Rock & Roll\\" also looked fondly towards their past and launched a secondary stream of audio, WOXY Vintage.

Early \\"Friends Of The Futurist\\" episodes were broadcast under the original name, \\"The Blogger Hour\\". *The Waiting Room: An eclectic mix of folk and acoustic tunes from around the globe, hosted by \\"one half of Drunk Country & The Woman of The House\\", still presently alive on AndHow.FM from Mangaroa, New Zealand. =Commercial = Most closely resembling the FM 'Future of Rock and Roll', WOXY.com, or WOXY (wox-IE) as it came to be known, sold banner ads on the pages of WOXY.com along with advertised sponsorship of some its mainstay programming to cover costs. Not only did this practice not yield a profit, it did not even cover operational costs. Accepting that their investor money was eroding faster than they hoped, \\"The Future of Rock & Roll\\" tried a new approach. =Subscription-based = On February 6, 2006, WOXY.com announced it would be moving to a subscriber-based model. In an effort to counteract a lack of advertising revenue, subscribers were to pay $9.95 per month for 128 kbit/s streams (both the main channel and the vintage channel) as well other perks including special content and contests. Despite popularity with listeners, the station's capital was running out, and the costs to operate far exceeded any income from subscriptions, fund raising, or from Internet advertising. On August 31, 2006, WOXY.com released a statement announcing that they would cease broadcasting. The last broadcast was September 15, 2006, and transmission ended around 5:38 p.m. EDT.Bishop, Lauren. 'Future of rock' fades, The Cincinnati Enquirer. September 15, 2006.

A fan of modern rock, Nguyen was contacted by a station listener through his music trading website Lala. In an unusual approach, Nguyen not only met with staff members and the station's current anonymous owners/investors, but also used the station's message boards to get feedback from listeners before formally making an offer. white knight..., WOXY.com message boards. September 19, 2006. Nguyen's proposal was to invest between $5 million and $10 million into WOXY.com, and allow the station to remain in Cincinnati. The DJs would retain editorial control. He would also link lala.com to WOXY.com, to allow WOXY.com listeners to purchase music that they've heard on the station directly from his existing site.

She was one of the few women affiliated with the Expressionist movement. Lasker-Sch√ºler fled Nazi Germany and lived out the rest of her life in Jerusalem.Three Plays, Else Lasker- Schuler (Archived) Biography Sch√ºler was born in Elberfeld, now a district of Wuppertal. Her mother, Jeannette Sch√ºler (n√©e Kissing) was a central figure in her poetry; the main character of her play Die Wupper was inspired by her father, Aaron Sch√ºler, a Jewish banker. Her brother Paul died when she was 13. Else was considered a child prodigy because she could read and write at the age of four. From 1880 she attended the Lyceum West an der Aue. After dropping out of school, she received private lessons at her parents' home. In 1894, Else married the physician and occasional chess player Jonathan Berthold Lasker (the elder brother of Emanuel Lasker, a World Chess Champion) and moved with him to Berlin, where she trained as an artist. On 27 July 1890 her mother died, her father followed 7 years later. On August 24, 1899, her son Paul was born and her first poems were published. She published her first full volume of poetry, Styx, three years later, in 1902. On 11 April 1903, she and Berthold Lasker divorced and on 30 November, she married Georg Lewin, artist, and founder of the Expressionist magazine Der Sturm. His pseudonym, Herwarth Walden, was her invention. L to R: Berthold Lasker, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler, Anna Lindwurm-Lindner, and Franz Lindwurm-Lindner around 1900 Lasker-Sch√ºler's first prose work, Das Peter-Hille-Buch, was published in 1906, after the death of Hille, one of her closest friends. In 1907, she published the prose collection Die N√§chte der Tino von Bagdad, followed by the play Die Wupper in 1909, which was not performed until later. A volume of poetry called Meine Wunder, published in 1911, established Lasker-Sch√ºler as the leading female representative of German expressionism. After separating from Herwarth Walden in 1910 and divorcing him in 1912, she found herself penniless and dependent on the financial support of her friends, in particular Karl Kraus. In 1912, she met Gottfried Benn. An intense friendship developed between them which found its literary outlet in a large number of love poems dedicated to him. In May 1922 she attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the \\"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\\". In 1927 the death of her son sent her into a deep depression. Despite winning the Kleist Prize in 1932, as a Jew she was physically harassed and threatened by the Nazis, She emigrated to Z√ºrich but there, too, she could not work and subsequently went to the Holy Land in 1934, and finally settled in Jerusalem in 1937. In 1938 she was stripped of her German citizenship and the outbreak of World War II prevented any return to Europe. According to her first Hebrew translator, Yehuda Amihai, she lived a life of poverty and the children in the neighborhood mocked her for her eccentric dress and behavior. Lasker-Sch√ºler dressed in an Oriental costume as her alternative persona \\"Prince Yussuf\\" She formed a literary salon called ‚ÄúKraal,‚Äù which Martin Buber, the philosopher, opened on January 10, 1942, at the French Cultural Center.‚Äù Some leading Jewish writers and promising poets attended her literary programs, but Lasker-Sch√ºler eventually was banned from giving readings and lectures because they were held in German. She begged the head of the German synagogue in Jerusalem to let her use his Gotteshaus (house of God) one more time: ‚ÄúWherever I was, German is not allowed to be spoken. I want to arrange the last Kraal evening for a poet who is already broken, to recite from his translations [into German] of a great Hebrew‚Äù (Letter to Rabbi Kurt Wilhelm, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler Archive, Jerusalem, cited in Bauschinger, p. 270). In her final years, Lasker-Sch√ºler worked on her drama IchundIch (IandI), which remained a fragment. However, she finished her volume of poems, Mein Blaues Klavier (1943, My Blue Piano), printed in a limited edition of 330 copies. ‚Äú[H]er literary farewell became her last attempt to overcome loneliness. Significantly, she dedicated the work to ‚Äúmy unforgettable friends in the cities of Germany and to those, like me, exiled and dispersed throughout the world, in good faith.‚Äù In one of her final acts, she asked that her hometown of Wuppertal and its surrounding area be spared from Allied bombing.\\" She tended to spend whatever money she had all at once which made her go for days without food or shelter. Heinz Gerling and the poet Manfred Schturmann came to her aid. Gerling opened a bank account for her and arranged for regular payments to cover her expenses whereas Schturmann edited her work and helped with her dealings with publishers. After her death Schturmann became the trustee of her legacy and during the 1950s and '60s dealt extensively with publishers in East and West Germany, Switzerland and Austria who wished to publish her works. In 1944 Lasker-Sch√ºler's health deteriorated. She suffered a heart attack on January 16, and died in Jerusalem on January 22, 1945. She was buried on the Mount of Olives. The grave of Else Lasker- Sch√ºler on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem The grave of Else Lasker-Sch√ºler on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem - Hebrew inscription on grave Literary career  Lasker-Sch√ºler memorial by Stephan Huber in Elberfeld, Wuppertal Lasker-Sch√ºler left behind several volumes of poetry and three plays, as well as many short stories, essays and letters. During her lifetime, her poems were published in various magazines, among them the journal Der Sturm edited by her second husband, and Karl Kraus' literary journal Die Fackel. She also published many anthologies of poetry, some of which she illustrated herself. Examples are: * Styx (first published volume of poetry, 1902) * Der siebente Tag (second volume of poetry, 1905) * ' (first edition, 1911) * Gesammelte Gedichte (complete poetry) (1917) * ' (1943)Mein blaues Klavier (1943) Lasker- Sch√ºler wrote her first and most important play, ', in 1908. It was published in 1909 and the first performance took place on 27 April 1919 at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. A large part of her work is composed of love poetry, but there are also deeply religious poems and prayers. Transitions between the two are often quite fluid. Her later work is particularly rich in biblical and oriental motifs. Lasker-Sch√ºler was very free with regard to the external rules of poetic form, however her works thereby achieve a greater inner concentration. She was also not averse to linguistic neologisms. A good example of her poetic art is her 1910 poem (lit. \\"An old Tibetan rug\\"), which was reprinted many times after its first publication in Der Sturm, the first of these being in Fackel. Influence The 20th-century Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid included a translation of an extract from Lasker-Sch√ºler's work in his long poem A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, 1926. (Lines 401‚Äì410.) Commemoration Angel for Jerusalem, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler Memorial in Jerusalem Forest, April 2007 There is a memorial plaque to Else Lasker-Sch√ºler at Motzstra√üe 7, Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, where she lived from 1924 to 1933. Part of this street was renamed Else-Lasker-Sch√ºler-Stra√üe in 1996. In Elberfeld in Wuppertal there is now a school named after her (The \\"School without Racism\\"), and a memorial stele was erected on Herzogstra√üe, Wuppertal. The Else-Lasker- Sch√ºler-Society was founded 1990 in Wuppertal by journalist Hajo Jahn. In more than 20 international symposia from Breslau to Tel Aviv, the works of the poet were introduced and discussed in relation to the relevance for the presence and future. In Jerusalem, there is a small street named for Else Lasker- Sch√ºler in the neighborhood of Nayot - Rehov Else. Perched on a ridge in the Jerusalem Forest, very close to the Kennedy Memorial (Yad Kennedy), was a sculpture in her honor resembling a slender tree trunk with wings. It was placed there in 1997, and was stolen, probably by metal thieves, in July 2007. In 2007, her final days in Jerusalem were commemorated in the BBC radio play My Blue Piano by the Scottish playwright Marty Ross (Radio 4 2007) which combined the facts of her dying days with the fantasies of her inner life.This can be heard at My Blue Piano On February 7, 2020, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.

It consists of two tapering towers, each surmounted by a cornice, joined by a less elevated section which encloses the entrance between them.Toby Wilkinson, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2005. p.195 The entrance was generally about half the height of the towers. Contemporary paintings of pylons show them with long poles flying banners. Egyptian architecture In ancient Egyptian religion, the pylon mirrored the hieroglyph for 'horizon' or akhet, which was a depiction of two hills \\"between which the sun rose and set.\\" Consequently, it played a critical role in the symbolic architecture of a cult building which was associated with the place of recreation and rebirth. Luxor Temple Pylons were often decorated with scenes emphasizing a king's authority since it was the public face of a cult building. On the first pylon of the temple of Isis at Philae, the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies while Isis, Horus and Hathor look on. Other examples of pylons can be seen in Karnak, Luxor, and Edfu. Rituals to the god Amun who became identified with the sun god Ra were often carried out on the top of temple pylons. In addition to standard vertical grooves on the exterior face of a pylon wall which were designed to hold flag poles, some pylons also contained internal stairways and rooms. The oldest intact pylons belong to mortuary temples from the 13th and 12th century BCE Ramessside period. A pair of obelisks usually stood in front of a pylon. Revival architecture The Sydney Harbour Bridge Both Neoclassical architecture and Egyptian Revival architecture employ the pylon form, with Boodle's gentlemen's club in London being an example of the Neoclassical style. The 19th and 20th centuries saw pylon architecture employed for bridge building with the Sydney Harbour Bridge being one of the largest examples. In 1928, a Pylon was erected by public subscription to commemorate the extension of the County Borough of Brighton on 1 April of that same year. The two stone towers known locally as \\"the Pylons\\" (sic) still stand and are clearly visible to travellers on either carriageway of the A23 road. The Patcham Pylon towers flank the southbound carriageway of the A23 just outside the city of Brighton and Hove and are listed Grade II: of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them.Public Sculptures of Sussex Many cathedrals have a similar western end, such as Elgin Cathedral in Elgin, Moray.

The difference between EBITDA and OCF would then reflect how the entity finances its net working capital in the short term. OCF is not a measure of free cash flow and the effect of investment activities would need to be considered to arrive at the free cash flow of the entity.

Contrary to its title, it offered ten new tracks of material, mostly produced by Van Dyke Parks, and was released in 1970.  Music and lyrics  Focusing more on country music than any other album in Ochs' canon, it featured an impressive number of musicians, including members of The Byrds and Elvis Presley's backing group alongside mainstays Lincoln Mayorga and Bob Rafkin. His lyrics were at their most self-referential and only one overtly political song appeared, \\"Ten Cents A Coup,\\" which includes an earnest (though comical) spoken introduction strung together from two anti-war rallies. The song is an ironic tribute to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, who Ochs wryly suggests are more laughable than Laurel and Hardy. Among the self-referential tracks was \\"Chords of Fame\\", which warned against the dangers of cult of personality. \\"Boy In Ohio\\" saw Ochs looking back nostalgically at his childhood and \\"Jim Dean of Indiana\\" was a tale of James Dean's life, a tribute to him, written after Ochs had visited Dean's grave. \\"No More Songs\\" was the most telling of the tracks, as Ochs would release but five more studio tracks in his lifetime after 1970, never completing another studio album.  Cover  The cover of the album is an homage to Elvis Presley's 1959 album 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong. The back cover of Greatest Hits featured the phrase \\"50 Phil Ochs Fans Can't Be Wrong\\". Ochs wore a gold lam√© suit inspired by similar suits made famous by Presley, and hired Nudie Cohn, who made Presley's suits, to make his. During his show at Carnegie Hall, which was recorded to be released as a live album, Ochs told the audience a story explaining his choice to wear the suit. He told them he had died in Chicago, in reference to the violence he witnessed during the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He said God gave him a chance to come back to earth as anyone he wanted and Ochs chose Presley. He added that if there was any hope for America it \\"relies on getting Elvis Presley to become Che Guevara\\". The suit is now part of the Phil Ochs archives at the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Track listing All songs by Phil Ochs.

He self-published Orkworld under the Wicked Press banner, and later co-founded the Wicked Dead Brewing Company with Jared Sorensen. His games under that company include Cat, Schauerm√§rchen, Enemy Gods, and Thirty. He has won the Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game and Best Collectible Card Game twice (for both the Legend of the Five Rings and 7th Sea role-playing games and collectible card games). He has also written for White Wolf, Inc., Pinnacle Entertainment Group, and worked for various video game companies, providing storyline and dialogue. He has written two regular on-line columns: The Game Designer's Journal (for The Gaming Outpost) and Play Dirty (for Pyramid Magazine). Legend of the Five Rings In 1995, Wick was a freelance writer living in Southern California. He had submitted articles to Shadis Magazine, Alderac Entertainment Group's independent game magazine, attracting the attention of the magazine's assistant editor, D.J. Trindle. He was brought on as a staff writer at D.J.'s request. Soon after joining AEG, he got involved with the production and design of the Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game, along with the rest of the company. He worked with Matthew D. Wilson, the game's art director and David Williams, the game's lead designer. He served as \\"Continuity Editor\\", which meant that he was responsible for the game's characters and plot details. Wick served as L5R's Continuity Editor for the Emerald Edition, Obsidian Edition, and Jade Edition sets, including the Shadowlands, Forbidden Knowledge, Anvil of Despair, Crimson & Jade, and Time of the Void expansions. He was also the primary source for storyline, flavor text and character for The Scorpion Coup set. Wick also led the RPG design team that created the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game (1997). Wick left the L5R design team shortly thereafter to work on AEG's forthcoming 7th Sea project. 7th Sea 7th Sea (1998) was the second RPG published by AEG, co-designed by John and Jennifer Wick, and Kevin Wilson. 7th Sea is AEG's swashbuckling setting. Initially proposed by Wick and his wife Jennifer, the game was intended to be self- contained, but quickly evolved into a much larger project. Telling the story of the world of Th√©ah, a fantasy amalgam of Restoration Age Europe, 7th Sea included pirates, musketeers, explorers and magic. Wick wrote and developed much of the project, including the 7th Sea Players Guide, Game Masters Guide, Avalon Sourcebook, GM screen, and Knights of the Rose and Cross sourcebook. He left AEG after his work on the Avalon Sourcebook was finished. On November 3, 2015, AEG announced that it had sold the rights to the 7th Sea property back to Wick, and entered a partnership with him to publish certain licensed games using the property. On April 2, 2019, Chaosium announced on their official blog their acquisition of the rights to the 7th Sea product line from John Wick.  Orkworld  After leaving AEG, he acquired a position at Totally Games, helping develop an Xbox launch title. He also wrote, designed and developed Orkworld, a reverse-fantasy game where orks are the heroes and the \\"monsters\\" are humans, dwarves, and elves. The game was released the same year as Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition and garnered an Origins Award nomination for Best Game Fiction. The game was illustrated by Thomas Denmark.  Neopets  After spending time in San Francisco, he returned to Los Angeles and began working at Neopets, writing stories for the Neopedia. He also helped develop the Neopets CCG.  Upper Deck  Wick was also a major contributor to the award-winning Vs. System CCG (Marvel TCG and DC Comics TCG) published by The Upper Deck Company.  The Wicked Dead Brewing Company  Wick began a new publishing venture with his friend Jared Sorensen. Calling their joint venture the Wicked Dead Brewing Company (based on Wick's previous publishing venture Wicked Press and Sorenson's Memento Mori Theatricks), they began in 2004 and have published over a dozen roleplaying games, board games, and books. He self-published a novel titled No Loyal Knight through the Wicked Dead Brewing Company. Wick published a number of dice-pool-based indie fantasy games, including Enemy Gods (2004) and Cat (2006).  John Wick Presents  Wick started a new company‚ÄîJohn Wick Presents‚Äîin 2009 when he kicked off his partnership with Cubicle 7 by reissuing his 2008 RPG Houses of the Blooded. He also released Curse of the Yellow Sign and Blood & Honor through this company.  Houses of the Blooded  In 2007, Wick announced a return to \\"big game design\\" in his LiveJournal. The game, called Houses of the Blooded, was released at the 2008 Origins Game Fair. The game focuses on \\"the ven\\" (a race of magically created humanoids) and the world of Shanri (both of which have showed up in a previous game, Enemy Gods). The pre-order for the limited edition version of Houses of the Blooded sold out in exactly one week. There were 100 copies available on the Indie Press Revolution website on May 5, 2008 and they were all gone by May 12. Wick was apparently surprised by this turn of events. Wick released a soundtrack with the new game, focusing on \\"ven blood opera,\\" an in-game element. Songs from the opera can be heard on the Houses of the Blooded website. Wick is keeping an open log of his design of this game in his LiveJournal. He has stated his intention to release several stand alone supplements that will detail various aspects of the world of Shanri. Each book would allow players to play a different role in Shanri and, as he stated in his livejournal, \\"almost feel as if they're playing a different game.\\" The books mentioned so far are a 'Slumming' book where players play ven nobles from cities (as opposed to 'country' ven detailed in the main book), a Wilderness book where vassals of the ven nobles fight off ork, explore dungeons, and possibly kill dragons, as well as a Suaven book where details regarding the Ancestor worship religion of the ven will be revealed. Wick teamed up with British games publisher Cubicle 7 Entertainment for a mass market release of the game in September 2009.  Freemasonry  In November 2005, Wick became a Freemason, joining Liberal Arts Lodge of Los Angeles, California. He is a Master Mason.

Fonyo lost his left leg to cancer at age 12. He later embarked on a cross-Canada marathon entitled the \\"Journey for Lives\\" to raise funds for cancer research. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of Terry Fox. Unlike Fox, who had to abandon the Marathon of Hope when his cancer returned, Fonyo completed the coast-to-coast marathon and also completed a marathon across the United Kingdom. Fonyo began his \\"Journey for Lives\\" marathon on March 31, 1984, at age 18, and completed it 425 days later on May 29, 1985, covering and raising $14 million (CDN). He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1985, the youngest person ever given that status at the time. This achievement was marred by grief, as his father Steve Fonyo Sr. died of lung cancer the same year. He studied mechanics and aircraft maintenance at an early age. He repeatedly ran afoul of the law, and was charged and convicted of various crimes. In February 2015, friends and family reported to news media that Fonyo was in an induced coma in Royal Columbian Hospital after being stabbed by three home invaders at his residence in Whalley, a neighbourhood of Surrey. The doctors placed Fonyo in a medically induced coma for a month after the attack. Legal troubles In 1996, Fonyo pleaded guilty to 16 charges for offences in Edmonton, including assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, fraud for writing bad cheques totalling $10,000 to supermarkets, and possession of a stolen vehicle. He has also been convicted at least five times of impaired driving and seven times of driving without a licence, most recently in the fall of 2008. On August 13, 2009, Fonyo, last known to have been working as a heavy-machinery mechanic, appeared in Surrey Provincial Court charged with one count of assault. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one day in jail. He was credited for 10 days already served. He was also subject to a one-year probation order. But just five days later, the 44-year-old was back in Surrey court, having breached his conditions. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 days in jail. His membership in the Order of Canada was revoked on December 10, 2009. On January 27, 2010, Fonyo gave a brief telephone interview to CTV News from the Surrey Remand Centre, where he was serving the balance of his sentence on an assault charge after breach of his parole. Fonyo stated it was wrong to have his Order of Canada revoked, as it was given to him for something he had previously done. On August 6, 2010, he was again arrested for fraud. On August 28, 2010, Fonyo married Lisa Greenwood. On December 7, 2010, Fonyo pleaded guilty to threatening Greenwood and to unrelated charges of fraud, credit card fraud, and driving with a suspended licence. Legacy Steve Fonyo Drive in Kingston, Ontario, is named after him, as is Steve Fonyo Beach in Victoria, British Columbia, where he ended his run. Fonyo Road was also named in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.

Born in Cork in 1759 her father, George Farren was a surgeon. His drinking habits brought on early death and his widow returned to Liverpool. Her mother went on the stage to support herself and her children. Elizabeth first appeared on the London stage in 1777 as Miss Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer and the following year appeared at Drury Lane which, along with the Haymarket Theatre became her primary venues for the rest of her acting career. She had over 100 characters in her repertoire including Shakespeare and various contemporary comedies and dramas. She was often compared to Frances Abington, who was her only real rival. Her last appearance was in April 1797, two months before her marriage to Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby. They had a son and two daughters. Early life Elizabeth (sometimes Eliza) Farren was the daughter of George Farren of Cork, Ireland, a surgeon and apothecary, later an actor, and his wife (n√©e Wright) of Liverpool, the daughter of a publican or brewer. At a very early age Farren performed at Bath and elsewhere in juvenile parts. In 1774 she was acting with her mother and sisters at Wakefield under Tate Wilkinson's opponent, Whiteley, when she played Columbine and sang. At the age of fifteen, at Liverpool, she played Rosetta in Love in a Village and subsequently her best known role of Lady Townly in The Provoked Husband by Colley Cibber. London career She was introduced by Younger, her Liverpool manager, to George Colman and made her first appearance in London at the Haymarket on 9 June 1777, playing Miss Hardcastle. Her performance was favourably received, and, after playing Maria in Murphy's Citizen, Rosetta, and Miss Tittup in Garrick's Bon Ton, she was cast as Rosina in the Spanish Barber, or the Useless Precaution, his adaptation from Beaumarchais' The Barber of Seville. She also spoke the epilogue to the play. On 11 July 1778 she was the original Nancy Lovel in Colman's Suicide. This was a \\"breeches\\" part, to which her figure was unsuited, and she was subjected to some satire for shapelessness. Performances as Lady Townly, and Lady Fanciful in the Provoked Wife restored her to public favour. In September 1778 she made her first appearance at Drury Lane, as Charlotte Rusport in the West Indian. She performed primarily at this theatre (where she was the successor to Frances Abington when the latter left in 1782) or at the Haymarket for the rest of her stage career, with occasional performances in the provinces and at Covent Garden. She had over 100 characters in her repertoire, including Berinthia in Sheridan's Trip to Scarborough, Belinda in Murphy's All in the Wrong, Angelica in Love for Love, Elvira in Spanish Friar, Hermione in the Winter's Tale, Olivia in Twelfth Night, Portia, Lydia Languish, Millamant in The Way of the World, Statira, Juliet, and Lady Betty Modish. She \\"created\\" few original parts: Lady Sash in the The Camp, assigned to Sheridan, Drury Lane, 15 October 1778; Mrs Sullen in Colman's Separate Maintenance, Drury Lane, 31 August 1779; Cecilia in Miss Lee's Chapter of Accidents, Haymarket, 5 August 1780; Almeida in Pratt's The Fair Circassian, 27 November 1781; and the heroines of various comedies and dramas of Mrs. Cowley, Mrs. Inchbald, General Burgoyne, Miles Peter Andrews, and of other writers. The last original part she played was the heroine of Holcroft's Force of Ridicule, 6 December 1796, which was unfavourably received on its first night and remains unprinted. On her last appearance, 8 April 1797, she played Lady Teazle; a large audience was attracted, and Farren, after speaking the farewell lines of her part, burst into tears. The Shakespearean parts of Hermione, Portia, Olivia and Juliet were in her repertory, but comedy parts such as Lady Betty Modish, Lady Townly, Lady Fanciful and Lady Teazle were her favourites. Farren had a slight figure and was above average height. Her face was expressive and animated, she had blue eyes, a winning smile, and a sweet, cultivated voice. In manner and bearing she appears to have had no rival except Frances Abington, with whom she was often compared. Retirement and latter life 1796 caricature by James Gillray, depicted next to her future husband. On 1 May 1797 she married Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby (1752‚Äì1834) by whom she had a daughter, Lady Mary Margaret Stanley, who married Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton. She died on 23 April 1829 at Knowsley Park, Lancashire. She had a short sentimental attachment to John Palmer and was admired and followed by Charles Fox. Lord Derby reportedly treated her with more respect than was sometimes given to ex-actresses. Hazlitt speaks of \\"Miss Farren, with her fine-lady airs and graces, with that elegant turn of her head and motion of her fan and tripping of her tongue\\" (Criticisms and Dramatic Essays, 1851, p. 49). Richard Cumberland (Memoirs, ii. 236) mentions her style as \\"exquisite.\\" George Colman the younger (Random Recollections, 1. 251) says of \\"the lovely and accomplished Miss Farren\\" that \\"No person ever more successfully performed the elegant levies of Lady Townly.\\" Tate Wilkinson credits her with \\"infinite merit\\" (Wandering Patentee, iii. 42). Boaden (Life of Siddons, ii. 318) says that after her retirement comedy degenerated into farce. Horace Walpole spoke of her as the most perfect actress he had ever seen, and Mrs. Siddons, on the day of Farren's marriage, commiserated the loss of \\"our comic muse.\\" Farren reportedly had an affair with Anne Seymour Damer.Piozzi, Hester. Diary entry dated 17 June 1790. Portraits A life-size portrait of her by Sir Thomas Lawrence, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was shown at the Royal Academy annual exhibition in 1790. Another portrait of her was in the Mathews collection in the Garrick Club c. 1900.

The term confluent refers to the merging of singular points of families of differential equations; confluere is Latin for \\"to flow together\\". There are several common standard forms of confluent hypergeometric functions: * Kummer's (confluent hypergeometric) function , introduced by , is a solution to Kummer's differential equation. This is also known as the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind. There is a different and unrelated Kummer's function bearing the same name. * Tricomi's (confluent hypergeometric) function introduced by , sometimes denoted by , is another solution to Kummer's equation. This is also known as the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. * Whittaker functions (for Edmund Taylor Whittaker) are solutions to Whittaker's equation. * Coulomb wave functions are solutions to the Coulomb wave equation. The Kummer functions, Whittaker functions, and Coulomb wave functions are essentially the same, and differ from each other only by elementary functions and change of variables. Kummer's equation Kummer's equation may be written as: :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (b-z)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} - aw = 0, with a regular singular point at and an irregular singular point at . It has two (usually) linearly independent solutions and . Kummer's function of the first kind is a generalized hypergeometric series introduced in , given by: :M(a,b,z)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {a^{(n)} z^n} {b^{(n)} n!}={}_1F_1(a;b;z), where: : a^{(0)}=1, : a^{(n)}=a(a+1)(a+2)\\\\cdots(a+n-1)\\\\, , is the rising factorial. Another common notation for this solution is . Considered as a function of , , or with the other two held constant, this defines an entire function of or , except when As a function of it is analytic except for poles at the non-positive integers. Some values of and yield solutions that can be expressed in terms of other known functions. See #Special cases. When is a non-positive integer, then Kummer's function (if it is defined) is a generalized Laguerre polynomial. Just as the confluent differential equation is a limit of the hypergeometric differential equation as the singular point at 1 is moved towards the singular point at ‚àû, the confluent hypergeometric function can be given as a limit of the hypergeometric function :M(a,c,z) = \\\\lim_{b\\\\to\\\\infty}{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z/b) and many of the properties of the confluent hypergeometric function are limiting cases of properties of the hypergeometric function. Since Kummer's equation is second order there must be another, independent, solution. The indicial equation of the method of Frobenius tells us that the lowest power of a power series solution to the Kummer equation is either 0 or . If we let be :w(z)=z^{1-b}v(z) then the differential equation gives :z^{2-b}\\\\frac{d^2v}{dz^2}+2(1-b)z^{1-b}\\\\frac{dv}{dz}-b(1-b)z^{-b}v + (b-z)\\\\left[z^{1-b}\\\\frac{dv}{dz}+(1-b)z^{-b}v\\\\right] - az^{1-b}v = 0 which, upon dividing out and simplifying, becomes :z\\\\frac{d^2v}{dz^2}+(2-b-z)\\\\frac{dv}{dz} - (a+1-b)v = 0. This means that is a solution so long as is not an integer greater than 1, just as is a solution so long as is not an integer less than 1. We can also use the Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function introduced by , and sometimes denoted by . It is a combination of the above two solutions, defined by :U(a,b,z)=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(1-b)}{\\\\Gamma(a+1-b)}M(a,b,z)+\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(b-1)}{\\\\Gamma(a)}z^{1-b}M(a+1-b,2-b,z). Although this expression is undefined for integer , it has the advantage that it can be extended to any integer by continuity. Unlike Kummer's function which is an entire function of , usually has a singularity at zero. For example, if and then is asymptotic to as goes to zero. But see #Special cases for some examples where it is an entire function (polynomial). Note that the solution to Kummer's equation is the same as the solution , see #Kummer's transformation. For most combinations of real or complex and , the functions and are independent, and if is a non-positive integer, so doesn't exist, then we may be able to use as a second solution. But if is a non-positive integer and is not a non-positive integer, then is a multiple of . In that case as well, can be used as a second solution if it exists and is different. But when is an integer greater than 1, this solution doesn't exist, and if then it exists but is a multiple of and of In those cases a second solution exists of the following form and is valid for any real or complex and any positive integer except when is a positive integer less than : :M(a,b,z)\\\\ln z+z^{1-b}\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty C_kz^k When a = 0 we can alternatively use: :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^z(-u)^{-b}e^u\\\\mathrm{d}u. When this is the exponential integral . A similar problem occurs when is a negative integer and is an integer less than 1. In this case doesn't exist, and is a multiple of A second solution is then of the form: :z^{1-b}M(a+1-b,2-b,z)\\\\ln z+\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty C_kz^k Other equations Confluent Hypergeometric Functions can be used to solve the Extended Confluent Hypergeometric Equation whose general form is given as: :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} +(b-z)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} -\\\\left(\\\\sum_{m=0}^M a_m z^m\\\\right)w = 0 Note that for or when the summation involves just one term, it reduces to the conventional Confluent Hypergeometric Equation. Thus Confluent Hypergeometric Functions can be used to solve \\"most\\" second-order ordinary differential equations whose variable coefficients are all linear functions of , because they can be transformed to the Extended Confluent Hypergeometric Equation. Consider the equation: :(A+Bz)\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (C+Dz)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} +(E+Fz)w = 0 First we move the regular singular point to by using the substitution of , which converts the equation to: :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (C+Dz)\\\\frac{dw}{dz} +(E+Fz)w = 0 with new values of , and . Next we use the substitution: : z \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}} z and multiply the equation by the same factor, obtaining: :z\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2}+\\\\left(C+\\\\frac{D}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}}z\\\\right)\\\\frac{dw}{dz}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{E}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}}+\\\\frac{F}{D^2-4F}z\\\\right)w=0 whose solution is :\\\\exp \\\\left ( - \\\\left (1+ \\\\frac{D}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}} \\\\right) \\\\frac{z}{2} \\\\right )w(z), where is a solution to Kummer's equation with :a=\\\\left (1+ \\\\frac{D}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}} \\\\right)\\\\frac{C}{2}-\\\\frac{E}{\\\\sqrt{D^2-4F}}, \\\\qquad b = C. Note that the square root may give an imaginary or complex number. If it is zero, another solution must be used, namely :\\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} Dz \\\\right )w(z), where is a confluent hypergeometric limit function satisfying :zw(z)+Cw'(z)+\\\\left(E-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}CD \\\\right)w(z)=0. As noted below, even the Bessel equation can be solved using confluent hypergeometric functions. Integral representations If , can be represented as an integral :M(a,b,z)= \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(b)}{\\\\Gamma(a)\\\\Gamma(b-a)}\\\\int_0^1 e^{zu}u^{a-1}(1-u)^{b-a-1}\\\\,du. thus is the characteristic function of the beta distribution. For with positive real part can be obtained by the Laplace integral :U(a,b,z) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(a)}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt}t^{a-1}(1+t)^{b-a-1}\\\\,dt, \\\\quad (\\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\ a>0) The integral defines a solution in the right half- plane . They can also be represented as Barnes integrals :M(a,b,z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(b)}{\\\\Gamma(a)}\\\\int_{-i\\\\infty}^{i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(-s)\\\\Gamma(a+s)}{\\\\Gamma(b+s)}(-z)^sds where the contour passes to one side of the poles of and to the other side of the poles of . Asymptotic behavior If a solution to Kummer's equation is asymptotic to a power of as , then the power must be . This is in fact the case for Tricomi's solution . Its asymptotic behavior as can be deduced from the integral representations. If , then making a change of variables in the integral followed by expanding the binomial series and integrating it formally term by term gives rise to an asymptotic series expansion, valid as :. :U(a,b,x)\\\\sim x^{-a} \\\\, _2F_0\\\\left(a,a-b+1;\\\\, ;-\\\\frac 1 x\\\\right), where _2F_0(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot; ;-1/x) is a generalized hypergeometric series with 1 as leading term, which generally converges nowhere, but exists as a formal power series in . This asymptotic expansion is also valid for complex instead of real , with The asymptotic behavior of Kummer's solution for large is: :M(a,b,z)\\\\sim\\\\Gamma(b)\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^zz^{a-b}}{\\\\Gamma(a)}+\\\\frac{(-z)^{-a}}{\\\\Gamma(b-a)}\\\\right) The powers of are taken using . This is derived from Abramowitz and Stegun (see reference below), page 508, where a full asymptotic series is given. They switch the sign of the exponent in in the right half-plane but this is immaterial, as the term is negligible there or else is an integer and the sign doesn't matter. The first term is not needed when is finite, that is when is not a non-positive integer and the real part of goes to negative infinity, whereas the second term is not needed when is finite, that is, when is a not a non-positive integer and the real part of goes to positive infinity. There is always some solution to Kummer's equation asymptotic to as . Usually this will be a combination of both and but can also be expressed as . Relations There are many relations between Kummer functions for various arguments and their derivatives. This section gives a few typical examples. Contiguous relations Given , the four functions are called contiguous to . The function can be written as a linear combination of any two of its contiguous functions, with rational coefficients in terms of , and . This gives relations, given by identifying any two lines on the right hand side of :\\\\begin{align} z\\\\frac{dM}{dz} = z\\\\frac{a}{b}M(a+,b+) &=a(M(a+)-M)\\\\ &=(b-1)(M(b-)-M)\\\\ &=(b-a)M(a-)+(a-b+z)M\\\\ &=z(a-b)M(b+)/b +zM\\\\ \\\\end{align} In the notation above, , , and so on. Repeatedly applying these relations gives a linear relation between any three functions of the form (and their higher derivatives), where , are integers. There are similar relations for . Kummer's transformation Kummer's functions are also related by Kummer's transformations: :M(a,b,z) = e^z\\\\,M(b-a,b,-z) :U(a,b,z)=z^{1-b} U\\\\left(1+a-b,2-b,z\\\\right). Multiplication theorem The following multiplication theorems hold true: :\\\\begin{align} U(a,b,z) &= e^{(1-t)z} \\\\sum_{i=0} \\\\frac{(t-1)^i z^i}{i!} U(a,b+i,z t)\\\\ &= e^{(1-t)z} t^{b-1} \\\\sum_{i=0} \\\\frac{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac 1 t\\\\right)^i}{i!} U(a-i,b-i,z t). \\\\end{align} Connection with Laguerre polynomials and similar representations In terms of Laguerre polynomials, Kummer's functions have several expansions, for example :M\\\\left(a,b,\\\\frac{x y}{x-1}\\\\right) = (1-x)^a \\\\cdot \\\\sum_n\\\\frac{a^{(n)}}{b^{(n)}}L_n^{(b-1)}(y)x^n Special cases Functions that can be expressed as special cases of the confluent hypergeometric function include: *Some elementary functions where the left-hand side is not defined when is a non-positive integer, but the right-hand side is still a solution of the corresponding Kummer equation: ::M(0,b,z)=1 ::U(0,c,z)=1 ::M(b,b,z)=e^z ::U(a,a,z)=e^z\\\\int_z^\\\\infty u^{-a}e^{-u}du (a polynomial if is a non-positive integer) ::\\\\frac{U(1,b,z)}{\\\\Gamma(b-1)}+\\\\frac{M(1,b,z)}{\\\\Gamma(b)}=z^{1-b}e^z ::M(n,b,z) for non-positive integer is a generalized Laguerre polynomial. ::U(n,c,z) for non-positive integer is a multiple of a generalized Laguerre polynomial, equal to \\\\tfrac{\\\\Gamma(1-c)}{\\\\Gamma(n+1-c)}M(n,c,z) when the latter exists. ::U(c-n,c,z) when is a positive integer is a closed form with powers of , equal to \\\\tfrac{\\\\Gamma(c-1)}{\\\\Gamma(c-n)}z^{1-c}M(1-n,2-c,z) when the latter exists. ::U(a,a+1,z)= z^{-a} ::U(-n,-2n,z) for non-negative integer is a Bessel polynomial (see lower down). ::M(1,2,z)=(e^z-1)/z,\\\\ \\\\ M(1,3,z)=2!(e^z-1-z)/z^2 etc. ::Using the contiguous relation aM(a+)=(a+z)M+z(a-b)M(b+)/b we get, for example, M(2,1,z)=(1+z)e^z. *Bateman's function *Bessel functions and many related functions such as Airy functions, Kelvin functions, Hankel functions. For example, in the special case the function reduces to a Bessel function: ::{}_1F_1(a,2a,x)= e^{x/2}\\\\, {}_0F_1 \\\\left(; a+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}; \\\\tfrac{x^2}{16} \\\\right) = e^{x/2} \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{x}{4}\\\\right)^{1/2-a}\\\\Gamma\\\\left(a+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\right)I_{a-1/2}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{x}{2}\\\\right). :This identity is sometimes also referred to as Kummer's second transformation. Similarly ::U(a,2a,x)= \\\\frac{e^{x/2}}{\\\\sqrt \\\\pi} x^{1/2-a} K_{a-1/2} (x/2), :When is a non-positive integer, this equals where is a Bessel polynomial. * The error function can be expressed as ::\\\\mathrm{erf}(x)= \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\int_0^x e^{-t^2} dt= \\\\frac{2x}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\ {}_1F_1\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2},\\\\tfrac{3}{2},-x^2\\\\right). *Coulomb wave function *Cunningham functions *Exponential integral and related functions such as the sine integral, logarithmic integral *Hermite polynomials *Incomplete gamma function *Laguerre polynomials *Parabolic cylinder function (or Weber function) *Poisson‚ÄìCharlier function *Toronto functions *Whittaker functions are solutions of Whittaker's equation that can be expressed in terms of Kummer functions and by ::M_{\\\\kappa,\\\\mu}(z) = e^{-\\\\tfrac{z}{2}} z^{\\\\mu+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}}M\\\\left(\\\\mu-\\\\kappa+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1+2\\\\mu; z\\\\right) ::W_{\\\\kappa,\\\\mu}(z) = e^{-\\\\tfrac{z}{2}} z^{\\\\mu+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}}U\\\\left(\\\\mu-\\\\kappa+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1+2\\\\mu; z\\\\right) * The general -th raw moment ( not necessarily an integer) can be expressed as :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[\\\\leftN\\\\left(\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2 \\\\right)\\\\right^p \\\\right] &= \\\\frac{\\\\left(2 \\\\sigma^2\\\\right)^{p/2} \\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1+p}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt \\\\pi} \\\\ {}_1F_1\\\\left(-\\\\tfrac p 2, \\\\tfrac 1 2, -\\\\tfrac{\\\\mu^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[N \\\\left(\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2 \\\\right)^p \\\\right] &= \\\\left (-2 \\\\sigma^2\\\\right)^{p/2} U\\\\left(-\\\\tfrac p 2, \\\\tfrac 1 2, -\\\\tfrac{\\\\mu^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} :In the second formula the function's second branch cut can be chosen by multiplying with . Application to continued fractions By applying a limiting argument to Gauss's continued fraction it can be shown that :\\\\frac{M(a+1,b+1,z)}{M(a,b,z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 - \\\\cfrac{{\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{b-a}{b(b+1)}z}} {1 + \\\\cfrac{{\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{a+1}{(b+1)(b+2)}z}} {1 - \\\\cfrac{{\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{b-a+1}{(b+2)(b+3)}z}} {1 + \\\\cfrac{{\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{a+2}{(b+3)(b+4)}z}}{1 - \\\\ddots}}}}} and that this continued fraction converges uniformly to a meromorphic function of in every bounded domain that does not include a pole.

In materials science, texture is the distribution of crystallographic orientations of a polycrystalline sample (it is also part of the geological fabric). A sample in which these orientations are fully random is said to have no distinct texture. If the crystallographic orientations are not random, but have some preferred orientation, then the sample has a weak, moderate or strong texture. The degree is dependent on the percentage of crystals having the preferred orientation. Texture is seen in almost all engineered materials, and can have a great influence on materials properties. Also, geologic rocks show texture due to their thermo-mechanic history of formation processes. One extreme case is a complete lack of texture: a solid with perfectly random crystallite orientation will have isotropic properties at length scales sufficiently larger than the size of the crystallites. The opposite extreme is a perfect single crystal, which likely has anisotropic properties by geometric necessity. Characterization and representation Texture can be determined by various methods. Some methods allow a quantitative analysis of the texture, while others are only qualitative. Among the quantitative techniques, the most widely used is X-ray diffraction using texture goniometers, followed by the EBSD method (electron backscatter diffraction) in scanning electron microscopes. Qualitative analysis can be done by Laue photography, simple X-ray diffraction or with a polarized microscope. Neutron and synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction are suitable for determining textures of bulk materials and in situ analysis, whereas laboratory x-ray diffraction instruments are more appropriate for analyzing textures of thin films. Texture is often represented using a pole figure, in which a specified crystallographic axis (or pole) from each of a representative number of crystallites is plotted in a stereographic projection, along with directions relevant to the material's processing history. These directions define the so- called sample reference frame and are, because the investigation of textures started from the cold working of metals, usually referred to as the rolling direction RD, the transverse direction TD and the normal direction ND. For drawn metal wires the cylindrical fiber axis turned out as the sample direction around which preferred orientation is typically observed (see below).

They are named either by the scientist that discovered them, or by the material they are most found in. These are given in miller indices for simplification purposes. *Cube component: (001)[100] *Brass component: (110)[-112] *Copper component: (112)[11-1] *S component: (123)[63-4] Orientation distribution function The full 3D representation of crystallographic texture is given by the orientation distribution function (ODF) which can be achieved through evaluation of a set of pole figures or diffraction patterns. Subsequently, all pole figures can be derived from the ODF. The ODF is defined as the volume fraction of grains with a certain orientation \\\\boldsymbol{g}. :ODF(\\\\boldsymbol{g})=\\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\frac{dV(\\\\boldsymbol{g})}{d g}. The orientation \\\\boldsymbol{g} is normally identified using three Euler angles. The Euler angles then describe the transition from the sample‚Äôs reference frame into the crystallographic reference frame of each individual grain of the polycrystal. One thus ends up with a large set of different Euler angles, the distribution of which is described by the ODF. The orientation distribution function, ODF, cannot be measured directly by any technique. Traditionally both X-ray diffraction and EBSD may collect pole figures. Different methodologies exist to obtain the ODF from the pole figures or data in general. They can be classified based on how they represent the ODF. Some represent the ODF as a function, sum of functions or expand it in a series of harmonic functions. Others, known as discrete methods, divide the ODF space in cells and focus on determining the value of the ODF in each cell. Origins forged connecting rod that has been etched to show grain flow. In wire and fiber, all crystals tend to have nearly identical orientation in the axial direction, but nearly random radial orientation. The most familiar exceptions to this rule are fiberglass, which has no crystal structure, and carbon fiber, in which the crystalline anisotropy is so great that a good-quality filament will be a distorted single crystal with approximately cylindrical symmetry (often compared to a jelly roll). Single-crystal fibers are also not uncommon. The making of metal sheet often involves compression in one direction and, in efficient rolling operations, tension in another, which can orient crystallites in both axes by a process known as grain flow. However, cold work destroys much of the crystalline order, and the new crystallites that arise with annealing usually have a different texture. Control of texture is extremely important in the making of silicon steel sheet for transformer cores (to reduce magnetic hysteresis) and of aluminium cans (since deep drawing requires extreme and relatively uniform plasticity). Texture in ceramics usually arises because the crystallites in a slurry have shapes that depend on crystalline orientation, often needle- or plate-shaped. These particles align themselves as water leaves the slurry, or as clay is formed. Casting or other fluid-to-solid transitions (i.e., thin-film deposition) produce textured solids when there is enough time and activation energy for atoms to find places in existing crystals, rather than condensing as an amorphous solid or starting new crystals of random orientation. Some facets of a crystal (often the close-packed planes) grow more rapidly than others, and the crystallites for which one of these planes faces in the direction of growth will usually out-compete crystals in other orientations. In the extreme, only one crystal will survive after a certain length: this is exploited in the Czochralski process (unless a seed crystal is used) and in the casting of turbine blades and other creep-sensitive parts. Texture and materials properties Material properties such as strength, chemical reactivity, stress corrosion cracking resistance, weldability, deformation behavior, resistance to radiation damage, and magnetic susceptibility can be highly dependent on the material‚Äôs texture and related changes in microstructure. In many materials, properties are texture-specific, and development of unfavorable textures when the material is fabricated or in use can create weaknesses that can initiate or exacerbate failures. Parts can fail to perform due to unfavorable textures in their component materials. Failures can correlate with the crystalline textures formed during fabrication or use of that component. Consequently, consideration of textures that are present in and that could form in engineered components while in use can be a critical when making decisions about the selection of some materials and methods employed to manufacture parts with those materials. When parts fail during use or abuse, understanding the textures that occur within those parts can be crucial to meaningful interpretation of failure analysis data.  Thin film textures  As the result of substrate effects producing preferred crystallite orientations, pronounced textures tend to occur in thin films Highly oriented TiO2 films on quartz substrates Surface coatings and technology . Modern technological devices to a large extent rely on polycrystalline thin films with thicknesses in the nanometer and micrometer ranges. This holds, for instance, for all microelectronic and most optoelectronic systems or sensoric and superconducting layers. Most thin film textures may be categorized as one of two different types: (1) for so-called fiber textures the orientation of a certain lattice plane is preferentially parallel to the substrate plane; (2) in biaxial textures the in-plane orientation of crystallites also tend to align with respect to the sample. The latter phenomenon is accordingly observed in nearly epitaxial growth processes, where certain crystallographic axes of crystals in the layer tend to align along a particular crystallographic orientation of the (single-crystal) substrate. Tailoring the texture on demand has become an important task in thin film technology. In the case of oxide compounds intended for transparent conducting films or surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, for instance, the polar axis should be aligned along the substrate normal. Another example is given by cables from high- temperature superconductors that are being developed as oxide multilayer systems deposited on metallic ribbons. The adjustment of the biaxial texture in YBa2Cu3O7‚àíŒ¥ layers turned out as the decisive prerequisite for achieving sufficiently large critical currents. The degree of texture is often subjected to an evolution during thin film growth and the most pronounced textures are only obtained after the layer has achieved a certain thickness. Thin film growers thus require information about the texture profile or the texture gradient in order to optimize the deposition process. The determination of texture gradients by x-ray scattering, however, is not straightforward, because different depths of a specimen contribute to the signal. Techniques that allow for the adequate deconvolution of diffraction intensity were developed only recently.

They also receive connections from rods and cones, allowing them to encode colour and spatial information. Dacey et al. found the giants' receptive field sizes to be about three times the diameter of those of parasol ganglion cells. There are only about 3000 giant retinal ganglion cells in each retina, comprising about 0.2% of the total number of retinal ganglion cells. When a giant is responding directly to light, Dacey et al. found its spectral sensitivity function to be similar in shape to those of rods and cones, but with a peak at 482 nm, in between S cones and rods. Dacey et al. also found giants' dynamic range to be 3-4 log units, far larger than any other photoreceptor type's and covering nearly the entire range of illuminations of natural daylight. Under naturalistic lighting conditions, responses to the rods and cones are superimposed on the melanopsin response of giant retinal ganglion cells. Giants encode colour via an S-Off, (L + M)-On opponency. Their spatial modulation transfer function is low-pass, with an upper limit of about 0.6 cycles per degree.

Background and early life Farrer was the son of Thomas Farrer, a solicitor in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Born in London, he was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1840. He was called to the bar at Lincolns Inn in 1844, but retired from practice in the course of a few years. Career in the civil service He entered the public service in 1850 as secretary to the naval department (renamed the marine department in 1853) of the Board of Trade. In 1865 he was promoted to be one of the joint secretaries of the Board of Trade, and in 1867 became permanent secretary. His tenure of this office, which he held for upwards of twenty years, was marked by many reforms and an energetic administration. Not only was he an advanced Liberal in politics, but an uncompromising advocate of free trade of the strictest school. He was created a baronet for his services at the Board of Trade in 1883, and in 1886 he retired from office. During the same year he published a work entitled Free Trade versus Fair Trade, in which he dealt with an economic controversy then greatly agitating the public mind. He had already, in 1883, written a volume on The State in its Relation to Trade. In 1889 he was co-opted by the Progressives as an alderman of the London County Council, of which he became vice-chairman in 1890. His efficiency and ability in this capacity were warmly recognized; but in the course of time divergences arose between his personal views and those of many of his colleagues. The tendency towards socialistic legislation which became apparent was quite at variance with his principles of individual enterprise and responsibility. He consequently resigned his position. In the 1893 Birthday Honours, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Farrer, of Abinger, in the County of Surrey. From this time forward he devoted much of his energy and leisure to advocating his views at the Cobden Club, the Political Economy Club, on the platform, and in the press. His efforts were especially directed against the opinions of the Fair Trade League, and upon this and other economic controversies he wrote able, clear, and uncompromising letters, which left no doubt that he still adhered to the doctrines of free trade as advocated by its earliest exponents. In 1898 he published his Studies in Currency. He was President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1894 to 1896. Marriage and issue Farrer married twice, first in 1854 to Frances Erskine (1825‚Äì1870), daughter of the historian and orientalist William Erskine (1773‚Äì1852) and his wife, Maitland Mackintosh, daughter of Sir James Mackintosh by his first wife. They bore the following children: * Hon. Emma Cecilia \\"Ida\\" Farrer (1854‚Äì1946), married Horace Darwin, son of Charles Darwin * Hon. Thomas Cecil Farrer (1859‚Äì1940), married Evelyn Spring Rice, daughter of Hon. Charles Spring Rice * Claude Erskine Farrer (1862‚Äì1890) * Hon. Noel Maitland Farrer (1867‚Äì1929) Frances died on 15 May 1870. Farrer remarried in 1873 to his former wife's half-cousin, Katherine Euphemia Wedgwood (1839‚Äì1931), daughter of Hensleigh Wedgwood of the Wedgwood pottery family and his wife Fanny Mackintosh. Death Thomas Farrer died at Abinger Hall, Dorking in 1899 and was buried at Brookwood Cemetery. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son Thomas Cecil (1859‚Äì1940).

' () is an ancient French term approximating \\"suburb\\" (now generally termed ). The earliest form is , derived from Latin , 'out of', and Vulgar Latin (originally Germanic) , 'town' or 'fortress'. Traditionally, this name was given to an agglomeration forming around a throughway leading outwards from a city gate, and usually took the name of the same thoroughfare within the city. As cities were often located atop hills (for defensive purposes), their outlying communities were frequently lower down. Many faubourgs were located below their towns, and the term \\"suburbs\\" is derived from this tendency ( = below; = city). Faubourgs are often considered the predecessor of European suburbs, into which they evolved generally in the 1950s and 1960s. Although early suburbs still conserved some characteristics related to faubourgs (such as the back alleys with doors, little break margins for houses, etc.), later suburbs underwent major changes in their construction, primarily in terms of residential density. Beside many French cities, can still be found outside Europe include the province of Quebec in Canada and the city of New Orleans in the United States. The cities of Quebec and Montreal contain examples, although Montreal has far greater divergences in terms of , which lead to similarities of many Ontarian and American suburbs. Paris Faubourgs were prominent around Paris since the 16th century. At that time, Paris was surrounded by a city wall. But even outside the Louis XIII wall there were urbanised areas, and those were called faubourgs. In 1701, these faubourgs were annexed to the city, and at about the same time, the wall was demolished, and where it once stood, there is now the chain of Great Boulevards that leads from via and to . The border of the city was transferred a few kilometers outwards, and the new borderline, which was in force until 1860, is now marked by the outer circle of boulevards passing through in the west and in the east. In 1860, the border of the city was once more transferred a few kilometers outwards to where it still is. Haussmann's renovation of Paris erased many traces of ancient faubourgs and the term banlieue was then coined. Many Parisian streets have retained their ancient denomination in spite of city growth; today it is still possible to discern pre-1701 delimitations in Paris by marking the point where a thoroughfare's name changes from to . For instance, the used to be located outside of the city wall and was an extension of the within the walls. The came about in a similar manner.  New Orleans  The term was also used in the early expansion of New Orleans beyond the original city plan, when French was still a common language in the colonial city. and , two of the oldest neighborhoods outside of the French Quarter, are persistent examples. Another early example was , originally (late 18th century) a residential area, which was overtaken by commerce, developing into the modern Central Business District.Campanella, Richard.

For example, the attacker might know that the last 80 bits of the keys are always the same, even though they don't know, at first, what the bits are. This appears, at first glance, to be an unrealistic model; it would certainly be unlikely that an attacker could persuade a human cryptographer to encrypt plaintexts under numerous secret keys related in some way. KASUMI KASUMI is an eight round, 64-bit block cipher with a 128-bit key. It is based upon MISTY1,Matsui, M., \\"New block encryption algorithm MISTY\\", 1997 and was designed to form the basis of the 3G confidentiality and integrity algorithms. Mark Blunden and Adrian Escott described differential related key attacks on five and six rounds of KASUMI. Differential attacks were introduced by Biham and Shamir. Related key attacks were first introduced by Biham.Biham, Eli. \\"New types of cryptanalytic attacks using related keys.\\" Journal of Cryptology 7.4 (1994): 229-246. Differential related key attacks are discussed in Kelsey et al.Kelsey, John, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner. \\"Key-schedule cryptanalysis of idea, g-des, gost, safer, and triple-des.\\" Advances in Cryptology\\"CRYPTO‚Äô96. Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, 1996. WEP An important example of a cryptographic protocol that failed because of a related-key attack is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) used in Wi-Fi wireless networks. Each client Wi-Fi network adapter and wireless access point in a WEP-protected network shares the same WEP key. Encryption uses the RC4 algorithm, a stream cipher. It is essential that the same key never be used twice with a stream cipher. To prevent this from happening, WEP includes a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) in each message packet. The RC4 key for that packet is the IV concatenated with the WEP key. WEP keys have to be changed manually and this typically happens infrequently. An attacker therefore can assume that all the keys used to encrypt packets share a single WEP key. This fact opened up WEP to a series of attacks which proved devastating. The simplest to understand uses the fact that the 24-bit IV only allows a little under 17 million possibilities. Because of the birthday paradox, it is likely that for every 4096 packets, two will share the same IV and hence the same RC4 key, allowing the packets to be attacked. More devastating attacks take advantage of certain weak keys in RC4 and eventually allow the WEP key itself to be recovered. In 2005, agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly demonstrated the ability to do this with widely available software tools in about three minutes. Preventing related-key attacks One approach to preventing related-key attacks is to design protocols and applications so that encryption keys will never have a simple relationship with each other. For example, each encryption key can be generated from the underlying key material using a key derivation function. For example, a replacement for WEP, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), uses three levels of keys: master key, working key and RC4 key. The master WPA key is shared with each client and access point and is used in a protocol called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to create new working keys frequently enough to thwart known attack methods. The working keys are then combined with a longer, 48-bit IV to form the RC4 key for each packet. This design mimics the WEP approach enough to allow WPA to be used with first- generation Wi-Fi network cards, some of which implemented portions of WEP in hardware. However, not all first-generation access points can run WPA. Another, more conservative approach is to employ a cipher designed to prevent related-key attacks altogether, usually by incorporating a strong key schedule. A newer version of Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA2, uses the AES block cipher instead of RC4, in part for this reason. There are related-key attacks against AES, but unlike those against RC4, they're far from practical to implement, and WPA2's key generation functions may provide some security against them. Many older network cards cannot run WPA2.

It is the only species within the genus Aeluroscalabotes. It is commonly called the cat gecko because of its habit of curling up with its tail around itself when it sleeps, similar to a cat.  Description  The cat gecko is a lightly built gecko, typically red-brown in color with white spots on its body, and solid white under its chin, and sometimes to the belly. Some specimens have brown blotching along the back. It is considered to be one of the more primitive geckos, and is physically quite similar in body structure to the few fossils of early geckos which have been discovered. They can grow to approximately 18 cm (7 inches), with males typically being smaller than females. As the only known semi- arboreal eublepharid, the cat gecko is known to possess subdigital seta up to 9 picometers in length; additionally, it uses small retractile claws and a prehensile tail to climb. http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=GeneralSearch&qid;=3&SID;=7C4BTveNbdFdVKCtCeq&page;=1&doc;=3#. thumb.  Behavior  Semi-arboreal and preferring cool, humid, montane rainforest habitats, the cat gecko is primarily nocturnal and insectivorous, consuming a wide variety of small insects.  Taxonomy  The species has been redescribed by several different taxonomists, leading to some early confusion in its classification, but its distinctly different morphological characteristics have clarified its status. There are two recognized subspecies of Aeluroscalabotes felinus: * Aeluroscalabotes felinus felinus (G√ºnther, 1864) * Aeluroscalabotes felinus multituberculatus (Kopstein, 1927)  In captivity  The cat gecko is a popular choice for a pet gecko, though they are not very commonly available and captive breeding is known to be difficult. Wild caught specimens often have heavy parasite loads, and they are easily susceptible to stress, so care can be difficult.  Conservation status  Exact population counts of the Cat gecko are unknown, though it is not considered to be common throughout its range. It does not hold any particular conservation status, except in Thailand, where collection and export is prohibited.

Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956. Biography The family hailed from Boaz, Alabama, United States, but rode the rails and hitch-hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 1930s. They struggled to make a living as itinerant fruit and vegetable pickers, following the harvest as far north as Washington and as far east as Arizona, as well as the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk, sleeping and eating on the ground.} Having settled in Modesto, California, the family developed their musical ability, and in 1937, performed on the radio, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939, they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centennial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage, they tore through \\"Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down\\" with rocking rhythms and risqu√© lyrics. They became, officially, California's best hillbilly band.Ramblin' Rose - The Life and Times of Rose Maddox. Jonny Whiteside. 1997. page 42.

Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. These quotes are from Rose Maddox: \\"We were called hillbilly singers ‚Äî not country ‚Äî then. No, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang ‚Äî country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.\\" The Maddoxes‚Äô material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis, cowboy songs, to the Western swing of Bob Wills, to old-time, folk, and church singing, to jazz, swing, boogie-woogie, and even a taste of early rock and roll. Fred Maddox played upright bass using the \\"slap bass\\" technique as early as 1937. This trademark backbeat, a slapping bass style, helped drive a broad change in popular music, sporting a faster, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly. Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. \\"They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.\\"The Blue Moon Boys - The Story of Elvis Presley's Band.

He died of an inoperable brain tumor at age 34, while in office as Virginia's Lieutenant Governor.  Early and family life Reynolds was born into wealth in New York City, the second son of Richard Samuel Reynolds, Jr. (president and CEO of Reynolds Metals Company), and Virginia McDonald Sargeant Reynolds. His grandfather had invented Reynolds Wrap and founded the metals company. His great-grandfather A.D. Reynolds of Bristol, Tennessee had been a successful tobacco farmer and brother of Richard Joshua Reynolds, who founded the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Sarge Reynolds was educated in Richmond, Virginia, graduating from St. Christopher's School in 1947, and from Woodberry Forest School in Orange, Virginia in 1954.

Reynolds then married Mary Ballou Handy Stettinius from Lynchburg, Virginia. They had one son, Richard Roland Reynolds. Career In 1958 Reynolds started his business career in the Market Research Department of the family's Reynolds Metals Company. In 1961 he became Assistant Treasurer and in 1965 he became Executive Vice-President of the Reynolds Aluminum Credit Corporation. He also taught economics at the University of Richmond to help him overcome shyness. Political career Reynolds began his political career with the Young Democratic Club, as the Byrd Organization struggled with the end of Massive Resistance. Reynolds first ran for elective office in 1965 and was elected as one of eight delegates for Richmond. In that election after the reapportionment required by Davis v. Mann as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1965, incumbents George E. Allen Jr., T. Coleman Andrews Jr., Harold H. Dervishian, Junie L. Bradshaw and Edward E. Lane won re-election, and Reynolds, E. B. Pendleton Jr. and T. Dix Sutton replaced fellow Democrat Fred G. Pollard (who became Lieutenant Governor) as well as Richmond's first elected Republicans in years--Louis S.

Fauchet published the earliest printed work of literary history in a vernacular language in Europe, the Recueil de l'origine de la langue et po√´sie fran√ßoise (1581). He was a high-ranking official in the governments of Charles IX, Henri III, and Henri IV, serving as the president of the Cour des monnaies. 446x446px  Early life  He was born in Paris, to Nicole Fauchet, procureur au Ch√¢telet, and Genevi√®ve Audrey, granddaughter of Jacques III De Thou. His mother was also connected through her daughter from an earlier marriage to the Godefroy family. Fauchet was thus closely connected by birth to the world of the Paris Parlement. Fauchet studied at the University of Paris before taking his degree in civil law at the University of Orl√©ans in 1550. He subsequently travelled through northern Italy, visiting Rome and also Venice, where he made the acquaintance of the humanist Sperone Speroni. Upon his return to Paris, Fauchet composed a series of short essays based on his wide reading in medieval French literature, much of which had not yet been printed and was only accessible in manuscript. He entitled this collection Les Veilles ou observations de plusieurs choses dinnes de memoire en la lecture d'aucuns autheurs fran√ßois par C.F.P., dated to 1555.The Veilles (French for 'vigils') are a literary miscellany in the tradition of Aulus Gellius's Attic Nights. The author's manuscript of this miscellany still exists; it was never printed in full in Fauchet's lifetime, though he would recycle parts of it in his later printed works on the history of French poetry and French magistratures.  Later life and the Recueil of 1581  Fauchet was eventually made second president of the Cour des monnaies (29 March 1569), and subsequently rose to the rank of premier pr√©sident in 1581. He held this office until 1599. Among his friends and colleagues are to be counted √âtienne Pasquier, Antoine Loisel, Henri de Mesmes, Louis Le Caron, Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf, Jacopo Corbinelli, Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, Filippo Pigafetta, Sperone Speroni, and many other learned and erudite characters of the sixteenth century. Fauchet's most important published work is his history of the French language and its poetry, the Recueil de l‚Äôorigine de la langue et po√´sie fran√ßoise (1581). The book is in two parts. The first part consists of a history of the development of the French language, out of a mixture of Gallo- Roman with Frankish elements. The second part of the Recueil is an anthology of 127 French poets living prior to 1300. Fauchet's theorising about language formation in the first book has been praised as ahead of its time, and throughout he demonstrates a profound knowledge of contemporary linguistic theory, as well as engaging with earlier and less frequently cited traditions of linguistic theory such as Dante's De vulgari eloquentia. The Recueil was much used in the following two centuries by literary historians and antiquarians curious about medieval French literature. During the Wars of Religion, as a member of the government of Henri III, Fauchet was forced to flee Paris in 1589 and could not return until 18 April 1594, now in the service of the new king, Henri IV. During this absence, Fauchet's Paris residence was sacked, resulting in the loss of his library: more than two thousand volumes, by his own account, many of which were manuscripts. Many medieval manuscripts once belonging to Fauchet now reside in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and the Bibllioteca Apostolica Vaticana in the Vatican, while some are scattered across Europe's libraries (Biblioth√®que Sainte- Genevi√®ve, Paris; the British Library; Berlin State Library; Dijon Public Library; National Library of Sweden; Burgerbibliothek of Berne; Biblioteca Ambrosiana) and still many others remain unaccounted for. The wars left Fauchet poor, and in 1599 he had to sell his office in the Cour des monnaies. Fauchet published most of his print works during this period, from 1599 to his death in 1602. Henri IV, said to have been amused with an epigram written by Fauchet, supposedly pensioned him with the title of historiographer of France, but there is no official record of this. He died in Paris. Fauchet has the reputation of being an impartial and scrupulously accurate writer, and in his works are to be found important facts not easily accessible elsewhere. His works taken together form a history of antiquities of Gaul and of Merovingian and Carolingian France (1579, 1599, 1601, 1602), of the dignities and magistrates of France (1600), of the origin of the French language and poetry (1581), and of the liberties of the Gallican church. A collected edition in a single massive volume was published in 1610. Fauchet read widely throughout his life among the key authors of Old and Middle French literature, including chroniclers and historians such as Jean Froissart, Enguerrand de Monstrelet, and Philippe de Commynes; and poets, such as Gace de la Buigne, Guillaume de Lorris, Jean de Meun, Huon de M√©ry, Hugues de Berz√©, and Chr√©tien de Troyes. Fauchet was also the first person to use the name 'Marie de France' to refer to the Anglo-Norman writer of the Lais.  Translation of Tacitus  Alongside his work as a historian and as a civil servant, Fauchet was also the first person to translate the complete works of Tacitus into French. A partial translation of the Annals (books XI-XVI) appeared anonymously for the first time alongside a translation of Annals, I-V, by Estienne de la Planche in an edition printed for Abel l'Angelier in 1581. The next year, l'Angelier brought out Fauchet's complete translation of the works of Tacitus (the Annals, Histories, Germania, and Agricola, but minus the Dialogue on Orators), which was reprinted in 1584. A translation of the Dialogue on Orators was brought out in 1585. While these translations were not openly published under Fauchet's name until the posthumous edition of 1612, the attribution is not in question.  Fauchet's name  Fauchet enjoyed punning on the etymology of his surname and on its symbolism for his activity as an antiquarian. In French, a 'fauchet' is an old-fashioned hay rake, used for gathering in the cut grass. Fauchet's personal motto was 'sparsa et neglecta coegi', i.e. 'I have gathered scattered and neglected things', a reference to the obscure and ancient texts he collected (or 'raked in') and used for his historical research. A Latin motto which appears beneath his portrait of 1599 reads 'Falchetus Francis sparsa & Neglecta co√´gi / Lilia queis varium hoc continuatur opus.' (I Fauchet have gathered for the French scattered and neglected / lilies with which this varied work is made). In the Recueil of 1581, Fauchet proudly writes, 'suivant ma devise, j'ai recueilli ce qui estoit espars et delaiss√©: ou si bien cach√©, qu'il eust est√© malais√© de le trouver sans grand travail' ('following my motto, I have gathered what was scattered and abandoned: or so well hidden, that it would have been difficult to find without much exertion'). Fauchet's activity as a collector of medieval manuscripts played a crucial role in the transmission of medieval French literature to the modern age.

Her post-modern music style has a variety of Mediterranean influences. Her first album, Amal, was released in 1998, and her second, Shauq, in 2004. Her songs take inspiration by Palestinian folklore, traditional Arabic heritage, and pop music elements, and express the struggle against the marginalisation and exclusion that Arab Palestinian culture feels. Early life Murkus was born and raised in the Arab town of Kafr Yasif in the Galilee area, and has devoted her career to promoting Palestinian music and culture in Israel and abroad. She was the fifth born out of six daughters. Murkus has been performing since she was five years old. In 1979, she won first prize in the Arab children's song festival, and went on to graduate from the Institute for Stage Art in Tel Aviv in 1990.Singing Their Life With Her Words Haaretz, 27 June 2003 Music career Murkus is a member of the counseling board of Free Muse, an organization working against the censorship of art and music. She took an active part in its congress in Denmark in 2003. Amal is currently studying art as a tool for social change at Musrara College in Jerusalem. Murkus appears regularly on TV in various educational and cultural programs. She has also appeared in feature films and was nominated for the Israeli Oscar for her performance in Ali Nasar's movie The Milky Way. In 2003, Murkus won 'Best Actress' at the Haifa Theatre Festival. Her extensive vocal range and abilities enable Murkus to sing in a wide variety of genres, from traditional Arab to modern popular western styles. As a result, she has created some remarkable collaborations with other artists and international musicians, including Joan Baez in an anti-war concert that took place in Tel Aviv in 1988; Mercedes Sosa; Oliver Shante, Germany; Stadio, Italy; the Greek singer Glykeria; Noa; Anwar Ebrahem from Tunisia, Enzo Avitabile of Italy; Nana Caymmi in Brazil; Robert Wyatt in the UK and The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (UK) in 2005, and many others. Murkus has also completed projects with the Palestinian poets Mahmoud Darwish in Nazareth in 2000 and Kafr Yasif in 1999, and Samih al-Qasim in 2006. Murkus has received many commendations for her unique art and music and for her work with local communities. In 2001, Murkus was chosen by Austrian TV as one of the most beautiful voices of the 20th century, after taking part in a music film produced by the Arte TV \\"Premadonas Fest\\", by the director-musician Andrew Heller, with Jesse Norman and Harris Alexiou, D.D. Bridgewater and others. Her first album, self- entitled \\"Amal\\" was written and composed by a diverse group of artists and musicians. It was released internationally in 2000 by EMI Hemisphere. Her second album Shauq (\\"Longing\\") was recorded live in April 2004, at the Crown Hall in Jerusalem, with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. Her third album is Na'na' ya Na'na' (\\"Peppermint, O Peppermint\\"). Amal has appeared in international music festivals and toured widely. She attracted attention when she was featured alongside the Palestinian rap group DAM in their critically acclaimed single and video clip \\"If I Could Go Back in Time\\" from the group's album \\"Dabkeh on the Moon\\". Political activism Amal considers herself a communist and a feminist. The Islamic Movement in Israel demanded that her performances be cancelled during the Ramadan. She says \\"I refused to cancel. I knew that this was not the real reason, since singing during Ramadan is not forbidden. I suppose that the people from the Islamic Movement are bothered by my social agenda. I criticize not only the Zionists, but also what is happening in my own society. I call for the liberation and empowerment of women. I believe that women hold the key ‚Äì if they do not progress, society will not progress. But the Islamic Movement wants us to remain in the dark\\". In August 2008 Amal sang at the birthday of Maria Amman, a Palestinian girl from the Gaza Strip who lost her mother, two of her brothers, her aunt and her grandmother after her house was hit by an IDF projectile, which also left Maria severely injured and almost completely paralyzed. Murkus said that she was trying to \\"give Maria a mother's attention, not just my songs, in a humble attempt to fill a tiny bit of the void left in her life. I came today to utter Maria's voice. The voice of Palestinian children, who are victimized by the war. The State should allow Maria and her family to stay, for her to receive the best treatment possible; that would be the least the State can do to make up for what has happened to this child\\". Personal life Murkus is married to Nizar Zreik, an architect, poet and musician, with whom she has two children.

It is located mainly within the City of Maroondah local government area, with a small part in the north west of the suburb being located in the City of Manningham. At the 2016 Census, Ringwood North had a population of 9,832. It is bounded on the south by Loughnan, Warrandyte and Wonga Roads (these roads flow into one another continuously). Glenvale Road forms the westernmost boundary in the southern part of the suburb, with the Warrandyte-Ringwood Road forming the western boundary at the northern end of the suburb. The eastern and northern boundaries follow property lines, rather than roads. Ringwood North Post Office opened on 9 August 1920, in the then rural area. Ringwood North has its own shopping centre and also has plenty of parklands and reserves nearby without being excessively rural, like Wonga Park or Warrandyte. Its roads feature a happy medium between the sterile, parallel streetscapes of Ringwood and the circular, 'contour-line' style streets found in neighbouring Park Orchards. Ringwood North is a surprisingly hilly area, which is especially evident around the aptly named Loughnan's Hill area and the infamously steep Glenvale Road. Glenvale Road also happens to mark the boundary between Ringwood North and Donvale and also the boundary between Maroondah and Manningham. It was the scene of a major car accident several years ago, in which a Holden HQ one- tonne utility carrying a large load of bricks overturned upon making its descent. Glenvale Road is also home to an 80-year-old Tudor house of famous heritage.

Accessed Dec. 27, 2008. is a popular creator of minicomics. Porcellino's self-published, photocopied, mostly autobiographical series King-Cat Comics is among the best-known and longest-running minicomics produced today. Porcellino created King-Cat in May 1989, and to date has self- published 79 issues.  Career For several years Porcellino had his own music and comics distribution company, Grinding Wheels Enterprises (evolving later into Spit and a Half), but he eventually abandoned it and went back to just publishing his own work. In the '90s Porcellino did some stories about his struggles to find a publisher for his work, and reprinted several of the rejection letters that criticized his drawing skills. He was briefly in negotiations to do an entire Trail Watch book, but that project fell through. Porcellino still mostly publishes himself, although now this is apparently mostly by choice. In recent years other publishers have been publishing collections of his work, including the graphic novel Perfect Example, chronicling his teenage struggles with depression. La Mano, Zak Sally's publishing venture, released Porcellino's Diary of a Mosquito Abatement Man, collecting various King-Cat stories about Porcellino's experiences as a pest control worker. The book won an Ignatz Award at the 2005 Small Press Expo in Bethesda, Maryland.  Style  Porcellino's graphic style is simple and spare, sometimes to the point of abstraction. He works almost exclusively in black and white, representing people, the natural world, and the built environment with a minimum of lines. Describing the subtle maturation of Porcellino's style over the many years of King-Cat, critic Paddy Johnston notes that \\"the essence of Porcellino's art, and of his visual storytelling, remains the same: sparse black and white lines simply detailing moments from his life with particular emotional resonance.\\" Personal life Porcellino lived in Denver, Colorado, from 1992‚Äì1998.Map of My Heart, p. 287.

He was born at Dornes, Ni√®vre. He was a curate of the church of St Roch, Paris, when he was engaged as tutor to the children of the marquis of Choiseul, brother of Louis XVs minister, an appointment which proved to be the first step to fortune. He was successively grand vicar to the archbishop of Bourges, preacher to the king, and abbot of Montfort-Lacarre. The philosophic tone of his sermons caused his dismissal from court in 1788 before he became a popular speaker in the Parisian sections. He was one of the leaders of the attack on the Bastille, and on 5 August 1789 he delivered an eloquent discourse by way of funeral sermon for the citizens slain on 14 July, taking as his text the words of St Paul, \\"Ye have been called to liberty\\". He blessed the tricolour flag for the National Guard, and in September was elected to the Commune, from which he retired in October 1790. During the next winter he organized within the Palais Royal the Social Club of the Society of the Friends of Truth, presiding over crowded meetings under the self-assumed title of procureur general de la v√©rit√©. Nevertheless, events were marching faster than his opinions, and the last occasion on which he carried his public with him was in a sermon preached at Notre Dame on 4 February 1791. In May he became constitutional bishop of Calvados, and was presently returned by the department to the Legislative Assembly, and afterwards to the Convention. At the king's trial he voted for the appeal to the people and for the penalty of imprisonment. He protested against the execution of Louis XVI in the Journal des amis (26 January 1793), and next month was denounced to the Convention for prohibiting married priests from the exercise of the priesthood in his diocese. He remained secretary to the Convention until, the accusation of the Girondists in May 1793. In July he was imprisoned on the charge of supporting the federalist movement at Caen, and of complicity with Charlotte Corday, whom he had taken to see a sitting of the Convention on her arrival in Paris. Of the second of these charges he was certainly innocent. With the Girondist deputies he was brought before the revolutionary tribunal on 30 October, and was guillotined on the following day. Despite his role in the church, earlier authors of this entry suggest he was a member of the atheistic secret society the Illuminati, \\"whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all Religion, even natural; and who endeavour to eradicate every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distinguish Man from Beast by his Shape only.\\" However, this understanding is likely based on a misreading of Snyder's letters to George Washington, which referred to a Fauchet as Illuminati. However, when the referenced letter is read contextually with the mention of Gen√™t, the French Envoy to America, the discussed Fauchet is likely Jean Antoine Joseph Fauchet, who actually visited the United States to arrest Gen√™t.

It is bounded by Waddon to the West and Selsdon and Sanderstead to the East. It is part of the South Croydon (CR2) post town and in the London Borough of Croydon. It is essentially a dormitory suburb for Croydon and London. Toponymy The placename Croydon is recorded as early as 809 and is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book. South Croydon as a distinct area is found much later, in the 19th century, when the area was developed as a residential suburb. Government The area is largely covered by the South Croydon ward of Croydon Council, which elected 3 Conservatives in the last local elections in May 2018. Parts of the area are also in Fairfield ward, which elected 3 Labour Councillors in May 2018. The area is split between the Parliamentary Constituencies of Croydon Central and Croydon South, with the area near South End located in Croydon Central, and the rest of the area located in Croydon South. Geography St Peter's Church The area is bounded by the South Croydon electoral ward of the London Borough of Croydon. To the west and south it is bounded by the historic Croydon parish boundary, which runs from Conduit Lane to Croham Hurst, crossing Croham Road where it becomes Croham Valley Road, then across to the railway line, crossing Selsdon Road where it becomes Upper Selsdon Road and crossing Carlton Road where it becomes Mayfield Road. Thereafter the old parish boundary roughly follows the railway south as far as the Red Deer public house, beyond which lies Purley Oaks. Curiously, Purley Oaks Primary School lies on the South Croydon side of the boundary and not in Purley Oaks. Landmarks of South Croydon include: * Croham Hurst * The former Swan and Sugarloaf public house, now a branch of Tesco Express. * The former Red Deer public house, now a Polish Supermarket * Whitgift School * St Peter's Church (designed by George Gilbert Scott) * St Augustine's Church * South Croydon Bus Garage * 46 South End Green space is provided to the west by the enormous Purley Way Playing Fields, and the hidden green space with gardens that is Haling Grove sandwiched between Pampisford Road and the A23: the extensive Whitgift School playing fields frequently host international cricket and rugby matches. The postal district of South Croydon includes Sanderstead, Selsdon and two remnants of Addington, Croham Valley and Monks Hill. It has the following schools: Harris Academy Purley (formerly Haling Manor High School), Regina Coeli Catholic Primary School, St Peter's Primary School, St Giles School (specialist disabled school), Ridgeway Primary School, Gresham Primary School, Purley Oaks Primary School, Howard Primary School, Atwood Primary School, Selsdon Primary and Nursery School, Greenvale Primary School, Gilbert Scott Primary School, Whitgift School and The Quest Academy. Conservation Area The Croham Manor Road Conservation Area lies in South Croydon, running from the junction with the Selsdon Road along the West side of Croham Hurst.

References have been inferred in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (c. 1602), (Act II, Scene iii), where Sir Toby Belch tells a clown: \\"Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song\\" and in Beaumont and Fletcher's Bonduca (1614), which contains the line \\"Whoa, here's a stir now! Sing a song o' sixpence!\\"Bonduca, act v, scene ii In the past it has often been attributed to George Steevens (1736‚Äì1800), who used it in a pun at the expense of Poet Laureate Henry James Pye (1745‚Äì1813) in 1790, but the first verse had already appeared in print in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, published in London around 1744, in the form: :Sing a Song of Sixpence, :A bag full of Rye, :Four and twenty Naughty Boys, :Baked in a Pye. The next printed version that survives, from around 1780, has two verses and the boys have been replaced by birds. A version of the modern four verses is first extant in Gammer Gurton's Garland or The Nursery Parnassus published in 1784, which ends with a magpie attacking the unfortunate maid. Fifth verses with the happier endings began to be added from the middle of the 19th century. Lyrics Cover illustration for Randolph Caldecott's Sing a Song for Sixpence (1880) A common modern version is: :Sing a song of sixpence, :A pocket full of rye. :Four and twenty blackbirds, :Baked in a pie. :When the pie was opened :The birds began to sing; :Wasn't that a dainty dish, :To set before the king. :The king was in his counting house, :Counting out his money; :The queen was in the parlour, :Eating bread and honey. :The maid was in the garden, :Hanging out the clothes, :When down came a blackbird :And pecked off her nose. :And shortly after that, :there came a little wren, :As she sat upon a chair, :and put it on again.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 394-5. The final line of the fourth verse is sometimes slightly varied, with nose pecked or nipped off. One of the following additional verses is often added to moderate the ending: :They sent for the king's doctor, :who sewed it on again; :He sewed it on so neatly, :the seam was never seen. or: :There was such a commotion, :that little Jenny wren :Flew down into the garden, :and put it back again.

It is known that a 16th- century amusement was to place live birds in a pie, as a form of entremet. An Italian cookbook from 1549 (translated into English in 1598) contained such a recipe:Giovanni de Roselli's Epulario, quale tratta del modo de cucinare ogni carne, ucelli, pesci... (1549), of which an English translation, Epulario, or the Italian Banquet, was published in 1598 (Mary Augusta Scott, Elizabethan Translations from the Italian no. 256, p. 333f.). \\"to make pies so that birds may be alive in them and fly out when it is cut up\\" and this was referred to in a cook book of 1725 by John Nott.Jenkins, Jessica Kerwin, The Encyclopedia of the Exquisite, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday,2010, p. 200-01 The wedding of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV of France in 1600 contains some interesting parallels. \\"The first surprise, though, came shortly before the starter‚Äîwhen the guests sat down, unfolded their napkins and saw songbirds fly out. The highlight of the meal was sherbets of milk and honey, which were created by Buontalenti.\\"Blow out! History's 10 greatest banquets - Features, Food & Drink - The Independent In their 1951 The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, Iona and Peter Opie write that the rhyme has been tied to a variety of historical events or folklorish symbols such as the queen symbolizing the moon, the king the sun, and the blackbirds the number of hours in a day; or, as the authors indicate, the blackbirds have been seen as an allusion to monks during the period of the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, with Catherine of Aragon representing the queen, and Anne Boleyn the maid. The rye and the birds have been seen to represent a tribute sent to Henry VII, and on another level, the term \\"pocketful of rye\\" may in fact refer to an older term of measurement. The number 24 has been tied to the Reformation and the printing of the English Bible with 24 letters. From a folklorish tradition, the blackbird taking the maid's nose has been seen as a demon stealing her soul.Opie, p. 471 No corroborative evidence has been found to support these theories and given that the earliest version has only one stanza and mentions \\"naughty boys\\" and not blackbirds, they can only be applicable if it is assumed that more recently printed versions accurately preserve an older tradition.

The Chantilly Tiffany was once thought to be extinct, but it is around and thriving. Chantilly-Tiffany Cat Chantilly-Tiffany Cat Appearance This cat has a semi-foreign body style and a full semi-long coat. The coat is silky, soft and smooth; the lack of undercoat usually makes grooming simpler than that of cats with an undercoat. The Chantilly-Tiffany is slow to mature and usually does not come into its full stature until about two years old. The eye color of the feline intensifies with age. The head should be a broad, modified wedge with gentle curves. It should have a medium length nose and a strong, broad, short, softly squared muzzle and defined but not obvious whisker pads. The Chantilly-Tiffany originated in a chocolate color, but later on was accepted in a range of colors including chocolate, blue, cinnamon, lilac, and fawn. Accepted patterns were solid, mackerel, ticked, and spotted tabby. The color was rich; shading in solids may occur toward the underside. The overall impression of an ideal Chantilly was a semi-foreign cat of striking appearance resulting from the combination of its rich color and full, silky semi-longhair coat, plumed tail, contrasting neck ruff, and ear furnishings. Eye color tends to be a very bright and clear yellow while the cat is young. As the cat ages, the color can become more golden.  Grooming  Some Chantilly-Tiffanys are over-groomed. They tend to pull their own hair, which can lead to patches of baldness and the formation of digestive tract hairballs. To help prevent this, owners are advised to brush the cat at least every other day to help control loose and shedding hair. History=The official beginning (1960s‚Äì1970s) The Chantilly/Tiffany breed had its official beginning as a \\"Foreign Longhair\\". In 1967 with Jennie Robinson (Neotype Cattery) of New York. She purchased a pair of semi-foreign longhaired chocolate cats with golden eyes in White Plains, New York. They may have had the same parents but were not litter-mates. \\"Thomas\\" was about a year of age upon purchase, and \\"Shirley\\" was around six months. Shirley's first litter of six kittens was born in 1969. They all were a chocolate color and shared a similar appearance. Robinson initiated a breeding program to emphasize these traits. In the early 1970s, the ACA registered Thomas and Shirley, along with many of their descendants as \\"Foreign-Longhairs\\". The passing of the torch (1970s‚Äì1980s) Robinson ended her breeding program in the 1970s. Sigyn Lund (Sig Tim Hil Cattery) a Florida Burmese breeder, purchased some of Ms. Robinson's kittens and took on the \\"Foreign Longhair\\" breeding program. The New York origin was not well known to the public at the time. Because of Lund's reputation as a Burmese breeder, It has been speculated that the Chantilly was a long haired Burmese. A change in the breed's name was requested by judges, because they felt the breed's current name \\"Foreign Longhair\\" was too general, the name \\"Mahogany\\" was suggested. Ms. Lund changed the breed-name from \\"Foreign-Longhair\\" to \\"Tiffany\\" (a name often representing elegance and class). Lund promoted the breed under \\"Tiffany\\". The ACA dropped the \\"Tiffany\\" from recognition, their reason being its rarity. As a result, all breed representatives registered under the Lund (Sig Tim Hil Cattery) name became unregistered and lost their pedigree status. After this event, the breed continued to be advertised as \\"Burmese\\". At one point, in an informal phone interview, Sig Tim Hil Cattery supplied information to researcher Joan Bernstein regarding these chocolate cats. This interview resulted in a publication of information, again suggesting the possibility they were the product of U.K. crosses between Burmese and Himalayans (a Persian/Siamese cross). This information was posted in Harper's Illustrated Handbook of Cats. In The Ultimate Cat Book by David Taylor in 1989, the Tiffany's history was also described as \\"produced from crossing Burmese cats with Persians\\". The false advertisement and the phone interview could explain the tie to the Burmese in these books. All this confusion led the breed to near-extinction. Chantillys and Canadian/American teamwork (1980s‚Äì1990s) Around the same time Robinson and Lund were developing the \\"Tiffany\\" in the United States, a Canadian acreage owner was surprised by a cat who appeared at his home in 1973. She was a long-haired, semi-foreign, chocolate, gold-eyed feline of unknown ancestry who gave birth to a litter of kittens. Once again these kittens were carbon copies of their mother, an experience shared by Robinson with the cats in her breeding program. Offspring of these were rescued by Canadian breeders in order to re-establish the \\"Tiffany\\" breed in North America with a cooperative effort with Robinson and Lund. One major advocate of the Chantilly was Tracy Oraas, who began her involvement with the breed in 1988 when she responded to a classified ad advertising \\"chocolate kittens.\\" Oraas got in touch with Siamese Oriental breeder Jan DeRegt, and Oraas and DeRegt undertook efforts to reestablish the breed after consulting a TICA judge. This judge expressed that nothing on the show bench compared with them. It took some major detective work, including calls to every veterinarian in Florida, but they managed to contact the Tiffany's original breeders, Jennie Robinson and Sigyn Lund. Oraas and DeRegt also concluded that the Burmese breed was never used in any Tiffany breeding program. Their research did reveal that English breeders had crossed Foreign Longhairs (in an attempt to recreate an Angora-type cat). They suspect that the Tiffany may have been a product of these efforts. Since none of the original Chantillys could be found, they established the breed using registered European Angoras, Havana Browns, Abyssinians and Nebelungs. In 1992, Oraas was asked to rename the breed because of possible confusion with the British Tiffanie. Wishing to preserve the elegance the \\"Tiffany\\" name represented, they chose \\"Chantilly.\\" The disappearance, and the last Chantilly Cattery (1990s‚Äì2000s) Tracy Oraas bred \\"Chantilly/Tiffany\\" cats up to the early 2000s, then seems to have faded from the breeding scene. In 2001, there were a few catteries working with the Chantilly: one in Germany, one in Canada, one in Washington State, one in West Virginia and one in southern Illinois, known as Amorino Cattery. Anne Davenport-Parini started Amorino Cattery in 2001 when she brought Nugget (also known as LTD or Little Tabby Dude) of Emberhearth Cattery home to Illinois. By 2003, Amorino was the only Chantilly cattery in the U.S. still operating. Davenport-Parini was the last known Chantilly breeder in the U.S. LTD produced many beautiful kittens before his retirement. The last known Chantillys, the fire, and extinction (2000s‚Äì2010s) In 2012, a devastating fire destroyed Amorino Cattery and its archives. With the fall of Amorino Cattery, the breed was facing extinction. The last Chantillys known in the U.S. were Frosty (grandson of LTD) and his daughter Acey. Frosty was shipped to a Nebelung breeder in Norway (Cacao Criadero Cattery). There was a struggle to get Frosty to breed to the Nebelung female, the exact reason for this being unknown. One kitten, Acey, was produced in the efforts. In 2015, the Norwegian breeder gave up on the Chantilly breeding program after the death of Frosty and fixed her female, Acey. As a result of this event, as far as it is known, the Chantilly is considered extinct. However, legend has it that a Chantilly- Tiffany cat by the name of Louanna was rescued as a kitten in Menands, New York. It‚Äôs been rumored she now goes by the name Lulu and lives comfortably with her family in Albany, NY. One also exists in Illinois. There are many pictures still around on the internet so they are definitely not extinct. http://www.cacaocriadero.com/182415131https://chantillytiffanycatproject.comrefCats101 Magazine, 4 Mar. 2015, cats101magazine.com/chantilly-tiffany-cat- breed/.Association, Cat Fanciers. \\"The Havana Brown: A Brown Delight and an Endangered Species.\\" 1998 Article about the Havana Brown, 1998, cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsCJ/HavanaBrown/HavanaBrown1998Article.aspx.CUI Links Chantilly/Tiffany, catsunited.com/html/cui_links_chantilly_tiffany.html.Taylor, David. \\"Tiffany.\\" The Ultimate Cat Book, 1989, pp. 71‚Äì71.Hackett, Stacy N. \\"Chantilly Lace.\\" Cat Fancy, Sept. 2014, pp. 36‚Äì37.Helgren, Anne. \\"Breed of the Month The Chantilly/Tiffany.\\" Cat Fancy, Dec. 1995, pp. 46‚Äì50.Helgren, Anne. \\"Mystery Cat The Chantilly/Tiffany.\\" Cats Magazine, Jan. 2000, pp. 54‚Äì57.Oraas, Tracy, and Jennie Robinson. \\"The Chantilly/Tiffany: Cat Breed FAQ.\\" Cat Fanciers, 20 June 1995, fanciers.com/breed-faqs/chantilly-faq.html.

Early life Born in London, she was the daughter of actors John Saville Faucit and Harriet Elizabeth Savill. Her parents separated when she was a girl, and her mother went to live with William Farren in 1825.Carol J. Carlisle, 'Saville , John Faucit (1783?‚Äì1853)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 2 Nov 2015 With her elder sister Harriet, she was trained for the stage by her step-uncle, Percy Farren. She debuted as Juliet at a small theatre in Richmond in 1833. Her performance was praised by critics of The Athenaeum, but Farren delayed her professional debut to give her further training. Early career Faucit's first professional appearance was made on 5 January 1836 at Covent Garden as Julia in James Sheridan Knowles's The Hunchback. Her debut, a spectacular success, placed her at once among the leading actresses in London, helping to fill the void left by the retirement of Fanny Kemble in 1834. Her success in The Hunchback was followed by turns as Belvidera in Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd, and as Margaret in Joanna Baillie's The Separation. Though her interpretation of Belvidera was received coldly by critics, she remained a favourite of playgoers; already in that first season, she was signed to a three-year contract at Covent Garden. Career with Macready William Charles Macready joined the Covent Garden company in the middle of 1836. In the following year, Faucit played numerous Shakespearean roles, among them Juliet, Imogen (Cymbeline), Hermione (The Winter's Tale), Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing), and Cordelia (King Lear), alongside both Macready and the soon-to-retire Charles Kemble. Her non-Shakespearean roles during the three years at Covent Garden included the female leads in Lytton's Duchess de la Valli√®re, Lady of Lyons, Richelieu, The Sea Captain, and Money, in Robert Browning's Strafford, and in Knowles's Woman's Wit. Faucit followed Macready to the Haymarket Theatre in 1840; in December of that year, however, she suffered an attack of a recurrent lung ailment. While she recuperated at the coast, rumours circulated that she was pregnant with Macready's child; her physicians published diagnoses that scotched these rumours. She returned to the Haymarket the next year, when she performed in Zouch Troughton's Nina Sforza and Lytton's Money. After a visit to Paris and a short season at the Haymarket, she joined the Drury Lane company under Macready early in 1842. There she played Lady Macbeth, Constance in King John, Desdemona, and Imogen, and took part in the first production of John Westland Marston's Patrician's Daughter (1842) and Browning's Blot on the Scutcheon (1843). Her Lady Macbeth of the 1843 season was, however, a failure; Macready found her conception deficient in \\"heart\\", and she was physically unable to achieve the commanding presence of Sarah Siddons, as Macready wished. She was, moreover passed over for Rosalind in favour of Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett; this role would later become one of her best-known Shakespearean roles. Nevertheless, Macready considered her \\"beyond all compare\\" the best English actress of the period. After Macready When Macready left for America in 1843, Faucit emerged as an even greater celebrity. In the mid-1840s she toured in Scotland and Ireland. Her most celebrated roles included Pauline in Lady of Lyons at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, Antigone at Dublin, and various Shakespearean roles, including a revamped and now-successful Lady Macbeth. Acting with Macready in Paris in 1845, she received so much applause that Macready was jealous, and the two did not act together again. Faucit occasionally returned to London, but her main activity for the remainder of her career was touring, especially in Manchester and in Sheffield, where her brother owned a theatre. In 1846 she returned to Dublin to perform in Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis, which proved as popular as her Antigone had been the previous year. In October 1846 she took the part of Juliet to the Romeo of Gustavus Brooke at Dublin.Brooke, Gustavus Vaughan (1818‚Äì1866) at Dictionary of Australian Biography In 1850, she acted in the title role of Iolanthe in Theodore Martin's adaptation of King Ren√©'s Daughter.Martin, Theodore. King Ren√©'s daughter: a Danish lyrical drama, W. Crosby and H.P. Nichols, 1850 The last time she assayed the role was in 1876 at the Lyceum Theatre, London, with Henry Irving's company opposite Irving as Count Tristan.Correspondence of Henry Irving, 6 June 1876, Henry Irving Foundation Centenary Project website. Retrieved 12 January 2012 Martin, the official biographer of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had begun courting her as early as 1843; she finally accepted his proposal in 1851. Career after marriage Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London In 1851 she married Theodore Martin, who was later knighted, making her Lady Martin. She continued to act occasionally for charity. One of her last appearances was as Beatrice, on the opening of the Shakespeare Memorial at Stratford-on-Avon on 23 April 1879. In 1881 there appeared in Blackwood's Magazine the first of her Letters on some of Shakespeares Heroines, which were published in book form as On Some of Shakespeare's Female Characters (1885). Lady Martin died at her home at Bryntysilio Hall near Llangollen in 1898, aged 82. There is a tablet dedicated to her in Llantysilio church. There is also a tablet to her in the Shakespeare Memorial with a portrait figure, and the marble pulpit in the Shakespeare church with her portrait as Saint Helena was given in her memory by her husband. She is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Despite its title, it was not entirely live, as several tracks were actually recorded in the studio, owing to flaws in the live recordings made in Boston and New York City in late 1965 and early 66. The album's producers retained the essence of a live album by including song patter and audience reactions between and during the songs. Phil Ochs in Concert features many of the folksinger's most enduring songs and represents the culmination of Ochs' folk career, the last of his original albums to be all-acoustic. Songs \\"There but for Fortune\\", which opens side two of the LP, is perhaps the best-known track. A minor hit for Joan Baez (whom Ochs jokingly credits with its authoring), this song encourages people to count themselves as fortunate, as fate takes its toll on those with broken lives who might have turned out differently under other circumstances, and makes the point that negative things can happen to anyone. Perhaps the second most known track, \\"Love Me, I'm a Liberal\\", is a sarcastic take on the fair-weather politics of mainstream American liberals. It has been covered (often with updated lyrics) many times since its initial release. The album features one of Ochs' few love songs, \\"Changes\\", an image-filled, impressionistic ballad lamenting the loss of his life with someone he loves. \\"Bracero\\" is a scathing attack on the plight of migrant workers who cross the border from Mexico to work for a pittance. \\"Cannons of Christianity\\" attacks the hypocrisy of church teachings and leaders. \\"Cops of the World\\" paints a portrait of America as invaders who want to impose their values and ways of life on the world, doing anything they please, expecting everybody else to comply. \\"Santo Domingo\\" depicts the 1965-66 U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic as a ruthless imperialist adventure. \\"Ringing of Revolution\\" presents a utopian vision of proletarian conquest and marks one of the earliest recorded political references to Ronald Reagan in music. The album opener, \\"I'm Gonna Say It Now\\", is in the voice of an idealistic college student towards the adults running the school, forcefully but respectfully asserting his right to speak his mind. The final song on the album, \\"When I'm Gone,\\" is a prescient, sad ode to the shortness of life and the pressing need to fight for social justice while you can.

Evidence of birch bark for writing goes back many centuries and in various cultures. The oldest dated birch bark manuscripts are numerous GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts from approximately the 1st century CE, which are believed to have created in Afghanistan, likely by the Dharmaguptaka sect. Translations of the texts, mostly in Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´, have produced the earliest known versions of significant Buddhist scriptures, including a Dhammapada, discourses of Buddha that include the Rhinoceros Sutra, Avadanas and Abhidharma texts. Sanskrit birch bark manuscripts written with Brahmi script have been dated to the first few centuries CE. Several early Sanskrit writers, such as KƒÅlidƒÅsa (c. 4th century CE), Sushruta (c. 3rd century CE), and VarƒÅhamihira (6th century CE) mention the use of birch bark for manuscripts. The bark of Betula utilis (Himalayan Birch) is still used today in India and Nepal for writing sacred mantras. Russian texts discovered in Veliky Novgorod have been dated to approximately the 9th to 15th century CE. Most of those documents are letters written by various people in the Old Novgorod dialect. The Irish language's native writing system Ogham, sometimes called the \\"tree alphabet\\", was legendarily invented by Ogma who wrote a proscription on birch to Lugh, warning him; the text of this proscription can be found in the Book of Ballymote. The first letter of Ogham is beith; beithe means \\"birch\\". GandhƒÅran Buddhist manuscripts Gandhara birchbark scroll fragments (c. 1st century) Buddhist manuscripts written in the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language are likely the oldest extant Indic texts, dating to approximately the 1st century CE. They were written on birch bark and stored in clay jars. The British Library acquired them in 1994. They were written in Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ and were believed to have originated from Afghanistan, because similar birch bark manuscripts had been discovered in eastern Afghanistan. Since 1994, a similar collection of GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ texts from the same era, called the Senior collection, has also surfaced. The British Library birch bark manuscripts were in the form of scrolls. They were very fragile and had already been damaged. They measured five to nine inches wide, and consisted of twelve- to eighteen-inch long, overlapping rolls that had been glued together to form longer scrolls. A thread sewn through the edges helped to hold them together. The script was written in black ink. The manuscripts were written on both sides of the scrolls, beginning at the top on one side, continuing with the scroll turned over and upside down, so that the text concluded at the top and back of the scroll. The longest intact scroll from the British Library collection is eighty-four inches long. The texts were likely compiled by the Dharmaguptaka sect and probably \\"represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in NagarƒÅhƒÅra\\", according to Richard Salomon.Richard Salomon.

The condition of the scrolls indicates that they were already in poor condition and fragments by the time they were stored in the clay jars. Scholars concluded that the fragmented scrolls were given a ritual interment, much like Jewish texts stored in a genizah. Sanskrit and BrƒÅhmƒ´ manuscripts Sarasvati in Walters museum holding a manuscript Kashmiri manuscript on birch bark (c. 17th century) The bark of Betula utilis (Himalayan Birch) has been used for centuries in India for writing scriptures and texts in various scripts. Its use was especially prevalent in historical Kashmir. Use of bark as paper has been mentioned by early Sanskrit writers such as Kalidasa (c. 4th century CE), Sushruta (c. 3rd century CE), and Varahamihira (6th century CE). In Kashmir, early scholars recounted that all of their books were written on Himalayan birch bark until the 16th century. Bower Manuscript on birch bark (c. 450 CE) A fragment of a birch bark scroll in Sanskrit, in the BrƒÅhmƒ´ script, was part of the British Library Gandhara scroll collection. It is presumed to be from North India, dating to sometime during the first few centuries CE. Birch bark manuscripts in BrƒÅhmƒ´ script were discovered in an ancient Buddhist monastery in Jaulian, near Taxila in the Punjab in Pakistan, and dated to the 5th century CE. The Bakhshali manuscript consists of seventy birch bark fragments written in Sanskrit and Prakrit, in the ≈öƒÅradƒÅ script. Based on the language and content, it is estimated to be from the 2nd to 3rd century CE. The text discusses various mathematical techniques. A large collection of birch bark scrolls were discovered in Afghanistan during the civil war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, possibly in the Bamiyan Caves. The approximately 3,000 scroll fragments are in Sanskrit or Buddhist Sanskrit, in the BrƒÅhmƒ´ script, and date to a period from the 2nd to 8th century CE. The Bower Manuscript is one of the oldest Sanskrit texts on birch bark in the BrƒÅhmƒ´ script. It includes several texts covering subjects including a medical treatise and proverbs. It was discovered in Kucha (currently in Aksu Prefecture in Xinjiang, China), an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the northern Silk Road, and is estimated to be from around 450 CE. The Gilgit Manuscripts were Buddhist texts discovered in the Gilgit area of Pakistan in 1931 and include various sutras, including the Lotus Sutra, along with folk tales, medicine, and philosophy. They are dated to approximately the 5th to 6th centuries AD, and were written in Buddhist Sanskrit in the ≈öƒÅradƒÅ script. Manuscripts containing the Devƒ´kavaca text, a hymn praising the goddess Durga, were thought to protect the person who carries them from evil influences like an amulet or charm. An example of one of these texts in Devanagari script from Nepal is held at Cambridge University Library (MS Add. 1578). Birch bark is still used in some parts of India and Nepal for writing sacred mantras. This practice was first mentioned c. 8th or 9th century CE, in the Lakshmi Tantra. In Indian sculpture, a Birch bark manuscript is easily identified by the droop. A palm leaf manuscript is stiff. East Slavic texts Birch-bark letter no. 292, Oldest known Karelian language text. (First half of the 13th century) Birch-bark letter no. 202 contains spelling lessons and drawings made by a boy named Onfim; based on draftsmanship, experts estimate his age as between 6 and 7 at the time. On July 26, 1951, during excavations in Novgorod, a Soviet expedition led by Artemiy Artsikhovsky found the first Russian birch bark writing in a layer dated to c. 1400. Since then, more than 1,000 similar documents were discovered in Staraya Russa, Smolensk, Torzhok, Pskov, Tver, Moscow, Ryazan, and Vologda, although Novgorod remains by far the most prolific source of them. In Ukraine, birch bark documents were found in Zvenyhorod, Volynia. In Belarus, several documents were unearthed in Vitebsk and Mstislavl. Birch-bark letter no. 497, c. 1340-90, Veliky Novgorod; photograph The late discovery of birch documents, as well as their amazing state of preservation, is explained by a deep culture layer in Novgorod (up to eight meters, or 25 feet) and heavy waterlogged clay soil which prevents the access of oxygen. Serious excavations in Novgorod started only in 1932, although some attempts had been made in the 19th century. Although their existence was mentioned in some old East Slavic manuscripts, the discovery of birch bark documents (, berestyan√°ya gr√°mota, and also gr√°mota in those documents) significantly changed the understanding of the cultural level and language spoken by the East Slavs between the 11th and 15th centuries. About a hundred styluses have also been found, mostly made of iron, some of bone or bronze. According to Valentin Yanin and Andrey Zaliznyak, most documents are ordinary letters by various people written in what is considered to be a vernacular dialect. The letters are of a personal or business character. A few documents include elaborate obscenities. Very few documents are written in Old Church Slavonic and only one in Old Norse. The school exercises and drawings by a young boy named Onfim have drawn much attention.** Yanin, Valentin L. (Feb 1990). \\"The Archaeology of Novgorod\\". Scientific American, p. 84\\\\.

Soviet Union There are birch bark letters written in modern times, most notably by victims of the Soviet repressions. People in Soviet forced settlements and GULAG camps in Siberia used strips of birch bark to write letters to their loved ones back home, due to inaccessibility of paper. Examples of these letters from Latvian victims of the Soviet regime are currently being considered to be included in the UNESCO \\"Memory of the World\\" heritage list. During World War II, propaganda newspapers and leaflets published by guerilla fighters were sometimes printed on birch bark due to shortage of paper.

This vein runs in the carotid sheath with the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. It begins in the posterior compartment of the jugular foramen, at the base of the skull. It is somewhat dilated at its origin, which is called the superior bulb. This vein also has a common trunk into which drains the anterior branch of the retromandibular vein, the facial vein, and the lingual vein. It runs down the side of the neck in a vertical direction, being at one end lateral to the internal carotid artery, and then lateral to the common carotid artery, and at the root of the neck, it unites with the subclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (innominate vein); a little above its termination is a second dilation, the inferior bulb. Above, it lies upon the rectus capitis lateralis, behind the internal carotid artery and the nerves passing through the jugular foramen. Lower down, the vein and artery lie upon the same plane, the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves passing forward between them. The vagus nerve descends between and behind the vein and the artery in the same sheath (the carotid sheath), and the accessory runs obliquely backward, superficial or deep to the vein. At the root of the neck, the right internal jugular vein is a little distance from the common carotid artery, and crosses the first part of the subclavian artery, while the left internal jugular vein usually overlaps the common carotid artery. The left vein is generally smaller than the right, and each contains a pair of valves, which exist about 2.5 cm above the termination of the vessel.  Variation  In 9‚Äì12% of the Western population, the size, shape or course of the internal jugular vein is abnormal. Variants identified including veins markedly smaller, or not functionally present. The mean diameter is 10 mm, but may range between 5 and 35 mm. Tributaries * Inferior petrosal sinus * Pharyngeal vein * Common facial vein * Lingual vein * Superior thyroid vein * Middle thyroid vein * Occipital vein (sometimes) Clinical relevance The jugular veins are relatively superficial and not protected by tissues such as bone or cartilage. This makes them susceptible to damage. Due to the large volumes of blood that flow through the jugular veins, damage to the jugulars can quickly cause significant blood loss, which can lead to hypovol√¶mic shock and then death if not treated. Jugular venous pressure As there is one pair of valves between the right atrium of the heart and the internal jugular, blood can flow back into the internal jugular when the pressure in the atrium is sufficiently high. This can be seen from the outside, and allows one to estimate the pressure in the atrium. The pulsation seen is called the jugular venous pressure, or JVP. This is normally viewed with the patient at 45 degrees turning his/her head slightly away from the observer. The JVP can be raised in a number of conditions: * right ventricular failure (heart failure), * tricuspid stenosis * tricuspid regurgitation * cardiac tamponade The JVP can also be artificially raised by applying pressure to the liver (the hepatojugular reflux). This method is used to locate the JVP and distinguish it from the carotid pulse. Unlike the carotid pulse, the JVP is impalpable. Catheterization As the internal jugular is large, central and relatively superficial, it is often used to place central venous lines. Such a line may be inserted for several reasons, such as to accurately measure the central venous pressure or to administer fluids when a line in a peripheral vein would be unsuitable (such as during resuscitation when peripheral veins are hard to locate). Because the internal jugular rarely varies in its location, it is easier to find than other veins. However, sometimes when a line is inserted the jugular is missed and other structures such as the carotid artery, lung or the vagus nerve (CN X) are punctured, and damage is caused to these structures.

It is separated from the sternocleidomastoideus by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia, and is covered by the platysma, the superficial fascia, and the integument; it crosses the cutaneous cervical nerve, and its upper half runs parallel with the great auricular nerve. Valves It is provided with two pairs of valves, the lower pair being placed at its entrance into the subclavian vein, the upper in most cases about 4 cm above the clavicle. The portion of vein between the two sets of valves is often dilated, and is termed the sinus.

Function This vein receives the occipital occasionally, the posterior external jugular, and, near its termination, the transverse cervical, transverse scapular, and anterior jugular veins; in the substance of the parotid, a large branch of communication from the internal jugular joins it.

The title is derived from the last words of U.S. Civil War Confederate General Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson: ‚ÄúLet us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees.‚Äù\\"Thomas J. 'Stonewall' Jackson dies,\\" May 10, 1863, This Day in History, History.com Hemingway's novel opens with Colonel Richard Cantwell, a 50-year-old US Army officer, duck hunting in Trieste, Italy at the close of World War II. It is revealed that Cantwell has a terminal heart condition, and most of the novel takes the form of a lengthy flashback, detailing his experiences in Italy during World War I through the days leading up to the duck hunt. The bulk of the narrative deals with his star-crossed romance of a Venetian woman named Renata who is over thirty years his junior. During a trip to Italy not long before writing the novel, Hemingway had met young Adriana Ivancich, with whom he became infatuated, and he used her as the model for the female character in the novel. The novel's central theme is death, and, more importantly, how death is faced. One biographer and critic sees a parallel between Hemingway's Across the River and Into the Trees and Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. The novel is built upon successive layers of symbolism and, as in his other writing, Hemingway employs here his distinctive, spare style (the \\"iceberg theory\\"), where the substance lies below the surface of the plot. Hemingway described Across the River and into the Trees, and one reader's reaction to it, using \\"Indian talk\\": \\"Book too much for him. Book start slow, then increase in pace till it becomes impossible to stand. I bring emotion up to where you can‚Äôt stand it, then we level off, so we won‚Äôt have to provide oxygen tents for the readers. Book is like engine. We have to slack her off gradually.\\"Ross, 36 Written in Italy, Cuba and France in the late 1940s, it was the first of his novels to receive negative press and reviews. It was nonetheless a bestseller in America, spending 7 weeks at the top of The New York Times bestseller's list in 1950, and was, in fact, Hemingway's only novel to top the list.John Bear, The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, pp. 47 It met with an unenthusiastic critical reception, one critic, J Donald Adams writing in The New York Times, describing it as ‚Äúone of the saddest books I have ever read; not because I am moved to compassion by the conjunction of love and death in the Colonel's life, but because a great talent has come, whether for now or forever, to such a dead end‚Äù.  Plot summary  The first chapter of Across the River and Into the Trees begins with a frame story depicting 50-year-old Colonel Richard Cantwell duck hunting in Venice in the present, taking place during the closing days of World War II. It is eventually revealed that Cantwell, referred to throughout the book simply as Colonel, has a terminal heart condition. Beginning in the second chapter, the book is presented primarily through a flashback narrative of the Colonel's experiences during both World Wars, from his service in the Italian army during WWI, to his time in the American Army, ascending to General before being demoted to Colonel. Hemingway provides great detail in describing Italy, from its landscape to its food and drink. The primary narrative of the book focuses on the Colonel's romance with the 18-year-old Venetian Renata, whom he calls Daughter. Renata is aware of the Colonel's terminal illness, and the book details how both characters come to terms with the Colonel's impending death. Many of the Colonel's wartime memories are revealed as stories he tells to Renata, who wants to \\"share\\" in his experiences. The novel ends with Cantwell suffering a fatal series of heart attacks as he leaves Venice after the duck hunt, on the same day as the book began. Shortly before dying, the Colonel recounts to his driver Stonewall Jackson's last words, from which the novel draws its name: \\"No, no, let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees.\\" The final scene shows the driver reading a note the Colonel had given him, indicating that his belongings should be given to their \\"rightful owner\\", Renata.  Background and publication Ernest Hemingway first met A. E. Hotchner, who later became a close friend, in 1948 when Hotchner, recently released from the Air Force, had taken a job with Cosmopolitan Magazine as a \\"commissioned agent.\\" Hemingway's name was on the list of authors Hotchner was to contact, so he went to Cuba, asked for a meeting (Hemingway took him to a bar), and for a short article. Hemingway did not write an article, but he did submit his next novel Across the River and into the Trees to Hotchner, which Cosmopolitan then serialized in five installments.Hotchner, ix‚ÄìxO'Hara, John. \\"The Author's Name is Hemingway\\". The New York Times. September 10, 1950. Retrieved March, 20, 2010.Sanderson, 26 The protagonist is generally considered to have been based loosely on a friend of Hemingway, Charles T. Lanham, with components of the character also being autobiographically based on the author himself. Hemingway worked on the book from 1949 to 1950 in four different places: he started writing during the winter of 1949 in Italy at Cortina D'Ampezzo; continued upon his return home to Cuba; finished the draft in Paris; and completed revisions in Venice in the winter of 1950.Baker (1972), 264‚Äì265 In the fall of 1948 he arrived in Italy and visited Fossalta where in 1918 he had been wounded. A month later, while duck hunting with an Italian aristocrat he met 18-year-old Adriana Ivancich.Meyers (1985), 439‚Äì444 He and his then wife Mary then went to Cortina to ski: she broke her ankle and, bored, Hemingway began the draft of the book.Sanderson, 24 Hemingway himself then became ill with an eye infection and was hospitalized. In the spring he went to Venice where he ate lunch with Adriana a few times. In May he returned to Cuba and carried out a protracted correspondence with her while working on the manuscript. In the autumn he had returned to Europe and he finished the draft at the Ritz in Paris. Once done, he and Mary went again to Cortina to ski: for the second time she broke her ankle and he contracted an eye infection. By February the first serialization was published in Cosmopolitan. The Hemingways returned to Paris in March and then home to Cuba where the final proofs were read before the September publication. Cosmopolitan Magazine serialized Across the River and Into the Trees from February to June 1950.Baker (1972), 265 Adriana Ivancich designed the dust jacket of the first edition, although her original artwork was redrawn by the Scribner's promotions department. The novel was published by Scribner's on 7 September 1950 with a first edition print run of 75,000, after a publicity campaign that hailed the novel as Hemingway's first book since the publication of his 1940 Spanish Civil War novel For Whom the Bell Tolls.Meyers (1985), 459  Writing style and genre  Hemingway started as a journalist and writer of short stories, and Baker suggests that he thus learned how to \\"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\\".Baker (1972), 117 The style is known as the Iceberg Theory because in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water; the supporting structure, complete with symbolism, operates out-of-sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \\"theory of omission.\\" Hemingway believed that a writer could describe one thing, while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.Oliver, 321‚Äì322 Baker calls Across the River and into the Trees a \\"lyric-poetical novel\\" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via symbolism.Baker (1972), 274‚Äì275 According to Meyers, an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major \\"shock\\"‚Äîthe murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home‚Äîto which Hemingway alludes only briefly.Meyers (1985), 445 Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections‚Äîas Stoltzfus has written: \\"Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he or she must cross alone without the narrator's help.\\" Across the River and into the Trees is constructed so that time is seemingly compressed and differentiated between present and past ‚Äì as one critic says, \\"memory and space-time coalesce.\\" To move Cantwell into the extended flashback, Hemingway uses the word \\"boy\\" as a bridge between time-present and time-past. The dialogue stays in the present tense, despite the time shifts, according to Stoltzfus, and the word \\"now\\" is repeated to \\"reinforce the illusion\\".  Themes  Cantwell, a 50-year-old military officer in love with the teenaged Renata, (whose name means \\"reborn\\"), is shown unlikeable as a character; one critic writes of him that his \\"lovemaking is described in terms of an infantry attack over difficult terrain\\".Svobada, 166 He is dying of heart disease and his relationship with Renata can be interpreted as a means of seeking youth or immortality. Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers believes Renata represents the city of Venice, she \\"connected\\" Cantwell (and Hemingway) to Italy, and in her characterization Hemingway romanticized what may have been a father-daughter relationship and he says Hemingway probably used Cantwell's fictional relationship with Renata as a substitute for his own relationship with Adriana, who looked almost identical to Renata's description. Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker says Hemingway captured the theme of \\"the three ages of man,\\" and in writing the book he finally objectified his own youthful traumatic war experiences. Baker sees a thematic parallel between Thomas Mann's Death in Venice and Across the River and into the Trees, presented in a series of commonalities and differences. Death in Venice is set in the summer on Venice's Lido; Hemingway puts Cantwell in Venice in the winter. Mann's protagonist is a writer; Hemingway's a soldier. Both face death, and in the face of death seek solace in a much younger character.Baker (1972), 267 Cantwell reminisces about the past while Renata (an 18-year-old countess with whom Cantwell spends the last days of his life) lives in the present. Cantwell says that \\"Every day is a new and fine illusion\\" where a kernel of truth can be found.Baker (1972), 268‚Äì273 Cantwell is a character in opposition: a tough soldier yet a tender friend and lover. The two Cantwells at times overlap and bleed into one another. Hemingway added yet another layer in the characterization: 50-year-old Cantwell in his dying day is \\"in an intense state of awareness\\" of his younger self of 1918 to the point that meld ‚Äì yet retain the differences wrought by time.Baker (1972), 278 Charles Oliver writes the novel shows a central Hemingway theme of \\"maintaining control over one's life, even in the face of terrible odds.\\" Cantwell knows he is dying and faces death \\"with the dignity which he believes he has maintained throughout his military service.\\"Oliver, 3 Oliver thinks the two male characters, Cantwell and Alvarito, have an unstated understanding ‚Äì both men love Renata, but Cantwell accepts and is happy to know Renata will almost certainly marry Alvarito. Within hours of dying he says to himself: \\"You have said goodbye to your girl and she has said goodbye to you. That is certainly simple\\". The theme of death is central in Hemingway's writings and his characters routinely achieve redemption at the moment of death, which can be seen as a form of existentialism. Jean-Paul Sartre believed to face death well is to live a heightened existence.Stoltzfus, (2005) Jackson Benson writes that how a writer transforms biographical events into art is more important than looking for connections between Hemingway's life and his fiction. He believes autobiographical events may have a \\"very tenuous relationship\\" to the fiction similar to a dream from which a drama emerges. Hemingway's later fiction, Benson writes \\"is like an adolescent day-dream in which he acts out infatuation and consummation, as in Across the River.\\" Meyers agrees that parallels exist between Hemingway and Colonel Cantwell, but he sees more similarities with Hemingway's friend of many decades \\"Chink\\" Dorman-Smith, whose military career was undermined causing his demotion.Meyers (1985), 471‚Äì474 Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general‚Äînot only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with \\"what if\\" scenarios: \\"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\\"Benson, (1989) For example, he describes Hemingway's experiences in the World War II battle of the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest succinctly as \\"Passchendaele with tree bursts.\\"Martin Herzog. Don‚Äôt Fraternize! Post-war American-German relations began 60 years ago , The Atlantic Times, October 2004. Paragraph 10. Reception Only a few contemporary critics praised the novel. John O'Hara wrote in The New York Times; \\"The most important author living today, the outstanding author since the death of Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616.\\" Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: \\"I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done.\\" Williams, Tennessee (August 13, 1950). \\"A Writer's Quest For a Parnassus\\".

Williams and O'Hara were among very few of the positive contemporary reviews, while negative reviews appeared in more than 150 publications.Stoltzfus (2003) Critics claimed the novel was too emotional, had inferior prose and a \\"static plot\\", and that Cantwell was an \\"avatar\\" for Hemingway's character Nick Adams. The novel was also criticized for being an unsuitable autobiography, and for presenting Cantwell as a bitter soldier.Mellow (1992), 459‚Äì451 According to Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker, Hemingway was \\"deeply wounded by the negative reviews\\" of this novel.Meyers, (1985), 454 Furthermore, Baker explains Hemingway was unaware that those close to him agreed with the majority of critics. For example, his wife Mary, who disapproved of Across the River and into the Trees, said: \\"I kept my mouth shut. Nobody had appointed me my husband's editor.\\"qtd. in Meyers (1985), 457‚Äì459 Later literary scholars consider the novel better than the contemporary reception.Meyers (1985), 470 Baker compares it to Shakespeare's Winter's Tale, or The Tempest: not a major work, but one with an \\"elegiac\\" tone.Baker (1972), 287 Literary biographer Jeffrey Meyers believes the novel shows a new \\"confessional mode\\" in Hemingway's work, and that it \\"would have been hailed as more impressive if it had been written by anyone but Hemingway.\\" Critic Ben Stoltzfus agrees, and he believes Hemingway's structure is more comprehensible for the modern reader‚Äîexposed to the Nouveau roman‚Äîthan for those of the mid-20th century. Film adaptation In 2016, it was announced that a feature film, starring Pierce Brosnan and directed by Martin Campbell, was being developed with producers Kirstin Roegner and John Smallcombe.

Dedicated to the residents of Hiroshima killed and injured by the first-ever wartime usage of an atomic weapon, the composition won the Tribune Internationale des Compositeurs UNESCO prize in 1961. Description The piece's written length is about 8 minutes and 37 seconds. Originally called 8'37\\", the piece applies the sonoristic technique which tends to focus on specific characteristics and qualities of timbre, texture, articulation, dynamics, and motion in an attempt to create freer form, and rigors of specific counterpoint to an ensemble of strings treated to unconventional scoring. Penderecki's stated intent with the composition was to \\"develop a new musical language\\". Penderecki later said, \\"It existed only in my imagination, in a somewhat abstract way.\\" When he heard an actual performance, \\"I was struck by the emotional charge of the work ... I searched for associations and, in the end, I decided to dedicate it to the Hiroshima victims\\". The piece spans 52 string instruments, melding them together in sonoristic manipulation and counterpoint in a manner which, according to reviewer Paul Griffiths, makes the listener \\"uneasy by choosing to refer to an event too terrible for string orchestral screams\\". The vertical component of the score is varied, with 24 violins divided into four sections, 10 violas divided into two sections, 10 cellos divided into two groups, and 8 basses in two sections. Threnody's sustained tone clusters and various extended techniques ‚Äì including a riot of varying vibrato, slapped instruments, playing on the tailpiece and behind the bridge ‚Äì are matched by an optical notation full of thick black lines. At times Penderecki takes an aleatoric approach, offering the players a choice of techniques or demanding irregular degrees of vibrato. The piece is also marked by a considerable rigor in its timing indications, notated in seconds, as well as specific note clusters and the use of quarter tones, clustered pitches and sound mass which accumulates in a reservoir of hypertonality. Usage in media In film, excerpts from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima are used in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's 2006 film Children of Men, Wes Craven's 1991 film The People Under the Stairs, David Lynch's 2017 television series Twin Peaks, and Gerry Anderson's 1969 film Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. In music, excerpts from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima are sampled in one version of Manic Street Preachers's 1991 song You Love Us and in SebastiAn's 2010 release Bird Games.

Official events on the tour count for World Golf Ranking points. The tour is recognised as being founded in 1973 when the PGA of Australia instituted an Order of Merit. Despite always including at least one tournament in New Zealand, the tour was known as the PGA Tour of Australia until it adopted its current name in 1991 following the inclusion of three events in Asia. Most of the leading players on the tour are Australian, with a smaller domestic contingent from New Zealand, but players from many other countries all over the world also participate. The very best Australasian players devote most of their time to the PGA Tour or the European Tour, typically returning home for events after the European and North American seasons end in mid-November, if they choose to play tournaments at home. Therefore, the Australasian Tour is a feeder for the larger tours. Some of the leading events are co-sanctioned by the European Tour to encourage higher ranked players to enter and to attract more sponsorship. Players with a background on the tour who have reached the world top 20 since the turn of the Millennium include Steve Elkington and Adam Scott. The leading tournaments on the tour include the Australian Open, the Australian PGA Championship, the Australian Masters and the New Zealand Open. In November 2005 it was reported by the BBC that the tour was going through difficult times, with the schedule for the 2005/06 summer season reduced to six events, three of them co- sponsored by other tours. The Heineken Classic, which was the richest event in Australasia in 2005, was cancelled in 2006 due to the withdrawal of the sponsor. One factor in the tour's problems is the rise of the nearby Asian Tour. Tour chairman Wayne Grady, and player Mark Hensby both accused Australia's biggest golf icon Greg Norman, who is a US resident, of not doing enough to support the tour. Norman dismissed their comments. To earn a PGA Tour of Australasia card, one must place in the top 40 of the tour's qualifying school. To retain a Tour card, a golfer must finish in the top 60 of the Order of Merit. Golfers ranked 61st‚Äì75th are given conditional status and those ranked 61st to 100th are given entry to the final stage of Q School. Those outside the top 100 lose their Tour cards unless exempt by other means, such as top twenty on the career money list. A win earns a two-year exemption for most events. Events considered Tier 1 are given three-year exemptions. Five-year exemptions are given to Order of Merit winners and the tour's three largest events (Australian PGA Championship, Australian Open, and Australian Masters). Entry to The Open Championship is given to the Order of Merit winner and the top three non-exempt players from the Australian Open. Von Nida Tour Between 2003 and 2008 the PGA Tour of Australasia ran a second-tier tour known as the Von Nida Tour (named after Australian golfer Norman Von Nida) which featured around ten events with purses in the region of A$100,000 each. The main tour events took place in the Southern Hemisphere summer, that is late one calendar year and early the next, while the Von Nida Tour events mainly took place in the local spring and autumn. However the money list was calculated for calendar years. From 2009, the Von Nida Tour has been merged into the PGA Tour of Australasia Tour. OneAsia Tour In January 2009, it was announced that there would be a new series of events across the Asia- Pacific region, to be organised by the PGA Tour of Australasia in co-operation with China Golf Association, the Japan Golf Tour, the Korean Golf Association and the Korean PGA. The aim of these events would be to raise the profile of professional golf in the region, and compete with the likes of the European Tour. The series would initially consist of six events, three in China, two in Australia and one in South Korea, with plans to expand to at least thirteen in 2010 as events in Japan were added, and over 20 by 2011. The introduction of the OneAsia series has not been universally welcomed, with strong opposition coming from the Asian Tour in particular, with support from its members. All of the six events announced for 2009 were existing tournaments, including some already sanctioned by the Asian Tour. One of them, the Pine Valley Beijing Open, was called off a few weeks before it was due to be held. The organisers officially attributed this decision to the state of the course and a clash of dates with The Players Championship on the US-based PGA Tour, but some media commentators dismissed these reasons since the tournament had clashed with the Players Championship the previous year as well, and attributed the cancellation to sponsor discontent with the sanctioning changes. OneAsia was discussed at the annual meeting of the International Federation of PGA Tours during the 2009 Masters Tournament. The Series would need to become a member of the Federation if it wishes to be able to award Official World Golf Ranking points in its own right. Points are currently available in all events due to those conferred by the PGA Tour of Australasia and the European Tour, as the Chinese and Korean tours are not Federation members. Under present arrangements it is unlikely that any new tournaments launched by OneAsia will receive ranking points, and could prove difficult to attract top players without them. At the meeting OneAsia and the Asian Tour both claimed that the game's powerbrokers understood the strength of their case, but neither received any public endorsements from the others members. Schedule PGA Tour of Australasia events have mainly been held in Australia and New Zealand although in past seasons, tournaments that have been co-sanctioned with other tours, such as the Johnnie Walker Classic, have been held in several other countries, including India and Thailand. There was a significant increase in the number of regular season tournaments in 2009, following the integration of the former Von Nida Tour events. Typically, only tournaments that were on the tour schedule prior to the merger were eligible for world ranking points. Beginning in 2012, all events will carry world ranking points, with the \\"State Based and Regional Tournaments\\" receiving a minimum of 6 points, compared with 16 points for regular events. The tour's flagship event, the Australian Open, awards a minimum of 32 points to the winner. The tour's richest events are those that are co-sanctioned by the larger global tours, such as the European Tour. The Australian Open, Australian PGA Championship and Fiji International have also maintained elevated prize funds as part of the OneAsia Tour. Australian Triple Crown In Australia, the Triple Crown also refers to winning the three major domestic championships, the Australian Open, the Australian Masters and the Australian PGA Championship. Winning all three titles in the same season is a feat only achieved by Robert Allenby in 2005.

It comprises the d√©partement of Doubs (except for Montb√©liard) and the d√©partement of Haute-Sa√¥ne (except for the canton of H√©ricourt). The see is currently sede vacante. From 1034 to 1184, the archbishop had civil authority within the Holy Roman Empire as the prince- archbishop of Besan√ßon. He gradually lost his civil power to the town council; the city became the Imperial city of Besan√ßon in 1184. The city was annexed by France in stages, eventually being fully subsumed by France in 1792 during the French Revolution. Early history of the diocese A statue of Ferreolus. Local tradition states that the diocese was evangelized by Saints Ferreolus and Ferrutio (Ferr√©ol and Ferjeux), who were sent here by St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon. According to the Catholic encyclopedia, \\"Louis Duchesne proved that these legends belong to a chain of narratives forged in the first half of the 6th century and of which the \\"passion\\" of St. Benignus of Dijon was the initial link.\\" During the Middle Ages several popes visited Besan√ßon, among them pope Leo IX who consecrated the altar of the old Cathedral of St. Etienne in 1050, and Eugenius III who in 1148 consecrated the church of St. Jean, the new cathedral. A council was held at Besan√ßon in 1162, presided over by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, in the interest of the Antipope Victor IV against Pope Alexander III. Guido of Burgundy, who was pope from 1119 to 1123 under the name of Calixtus II, and the Jesuit Claude-Adrien Nonnotte (1711‚Äì1793), an adversary of Voltaire, were natives of Besan√ßon. Abbeys founded from the diocese The monastery of Luxeuil, founded by St. Columbanus (d. 615), gave to the diocese of Besan√ßon a series of saints. First came the direct successors of St. Columbanus: the Abbot St. Eustasius who founded a celebrated school in this monastery; the Abbot St. Valbert who sent monks to found the Abbeys of St. Val√©ry, St. Omer, and St. Bertin, and died in 665; the Abbot St. Ingofroid; St. Donatus, who became Bishop of Besan√ßon; and St. Ansegisus, author of a celebrated collection of capitularies. The Abbey of Lure (in Haute-Sa√¥ne) was founded at the beginning of the 7th century by St. D√©icole (Deicolus), or Desle, disciple of St. Columbanus; later its abbots were princes of the Holy Empire. The Abbey of Beaume les Dames, founded in the 5th century and in which Gontram, King of Burgundy, was buried, was the school where St. Odo, afterwards Abbot of Cluny, studied in the tenth century; at the end of the eighth century there was built near it an abbey for Benedictine nuns, members of the nobility. During the French Revolution the superb church of this abbey was laid waste. Other saints of the Diocese of Besan√ßon include the hermit St. Aldegrin (10th century). Later history St. Peter Fourier (1565‚Äì1640), who inaugurated systematic education for girls, was born in the diocese. The miracle attributed to the \\"Sacred Host of Faverney\\", during a fire in the year 1608, was annually commemorated by elaborate ceremonies. The places of pilgrimage were Notre Dame du Ch√™ne at Scey; Notre Dame d'Aigremont; the pilgrimage of St. Pierre of Tarentaise at Cirey-les-Bellevaux, where St. Pierre de Tarentaise died in 1174; Notre Dame des Jacobins at Besan√ßon; and Notre Dame de la Motte at Vesoul. Few 19th-century dioceses have undergone similar territorial changes. The Concordat of 1802 gave the Diocese of Besan√ßon all those districts which, in 1822, constituted the Diocese of St.-Claude. In 1806, Besan√ßon was given jurisdiction over the three parishes of the Principality of Neufch√¢tel (Switzerland) which fell under the control of the bishopric of Lausanne in 1814. In 1870, after the annexation of Alsace- Lorraine by Germany, the district of Belfort was withdrawn from the bishopric of Strasburg and attached to the diocese of Besan√ßon. The metropolitan jurisdiction of Besan√ßon also underwent changes. In 1802 its suffragans were the Bishoprics of Dijon and Autun (in Burgundy), Metz, Nancy and Strasbourg (in Alsace-Lorraine). Under the Bourbon Restoration, Dijon and Autun were withdrawn from Besan√ßon, which became the metropolitan of the sees of Saint- Di√©, Verdun and Belley. In 1874, after the Franco-Prussian War, the churches of Metz and Strasburg were exempt, under the direct control of the Holy See. On 3 November 1979, Belfort, Montb√©liard, and the canton of H√©ricourt (Haute- Sa√¥ne) were detached from the diocese of Besan√ßon and constituted into a new autonomous diocese, that of Belfort-Montb√©liard.Historique ‚Äî Dioc√®se de Besan√ßon - Eglise Catholique de Besan√ßon Bishops=To 1000 Saint Claudius served as bishop of Besan√ßon during the 7th century.

The program was produced for American Public Media and hosted by John Moe in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Weekend America launched Saturday, May 1, 2004, as a pilot aired by the show's developmental stations, then known as Public Radio Weekend. The show went national under the Weekend America branding Saturday, October 9, 2004. Public radio veterans Bill Radke and Barbara Bogaev, based in Los Angeles, served as hosts during the pilot stage and early national phase. Bogaev left the program on December 9, 2006. Detroit native Desiree Cooper was selected to replace Bogaev, beginning in August 2007. Cooper's arrival signaled a shift in the program's production, with Radke's segments originating in L.A., and Cooper's from St. Paul, Minnesota. As part of a consolidation move in the summer of 2008, American Public Media moved production on Weekend America from Los Angeles to St. Paul. The changes shook up the cast. Cooper was bumped to \\"Senior Correspondent\\" and returned to Detroit. Radke left the program altogether. Commentator and occasional substitute host John Moe was promoted to sole host, based in St. Paul. The show was divided into two hours, which were further subdivided into five segments per hour. Weekend America was designed to be run untouched; with local cutaways at predetermined points; with long local segments in place of one of the five national segments; or as one or two national segments spliced into a locally produced show. Many public radio stations aired the show untouched. Regular segments of the show included \\"Good News, Bad News, or No News\\", where three panelists evaluated the significance of a recent news item; \\"A Little Bit of Weather Everywhere\\", which featured unique events happening around the country and the weather for the day at these events; and \\"Weekend Soundtrack\\", where callers shared a favorite song that provides a backdrop to their weekends. The theme music was \\"Crazyhorse Mongoose\\" by Galactic. Cancellation American Public Media announced on December 19, 2008 the cancellation of the show due to financial pressures. The last program aired January 31, 2009.

Its capital was Regensburg. History The principality was initially created as an ecclesiastical electorate for Archbishop Karl Theodor von Dalberg, the Elector-Archchancellor of the Empire and the former Archbishop of Mainz, due to the annexation of Mainz itself by the French following the Treaty of Lun√©ville. Most of the new principality consisted of the territory of the former Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg. The principality also included the Lordships of Donaustauf, W√∂rth, and Hohenburg, the former free imperial city of Regensburg, St. Emmeram's Abbey, and the abbeys Oberm√ºnster and Niederm√ºnster located within the city of Regensburg. Dalberg also acquired the newly-created Principality of Aschaffenburg along the Main river. Dalberg received the electoral dignity previously accorded to the Electorate of Mainz; his new principality has thus been known in German as ' (\\"Electorate of Regensburg\\"). Because the archiepiscopal status of Mainz had also been transferred to the Regensburg diocese, the principality has also been known in English as the Archbishopric of Regensburg. Because of Bavarian claims on Regensburg, Dalberg was not installed as archbishop until 1 February 1805. The principality lost its status as an electorate in 1806 with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and became part of the Confederation of the Rhine later that year. The Napoleonic Code was introduced in 1809. During the War of the Fifth Coalition, Austrian troops occupied Regensburg on 20 April 1809; it was shelled and stormed by French troops three days later. In the Treaty of Paris, Dalberg conceded Regensburg to the Kingdom of Bavaria, which formally incorporated the city on 22 May 1810. In return for conceding Regensburg, Dalberg was granted Hanau and Fulda, which he combined with the Principality of Aschaffenburg to create the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. Although he had lost the Principality of Regensburg, Dalberg retained the title of Archbishop of Regensburg until his death in 1817, after which time the archbishopric was downgraded to a suffragan diocese of Munich and Freising.

A column inch is a unit of space one column wide by high. A newspaper page Newspaper pages are laid out on a grid that consists of a margin on 4 sides, a number of vertical columns and space in between columns, called gutters. Broadsheet newspaper pages in the United States usually have 6-9 columns, while tabloid sized publications have 5 columns. Column width In the United States, a common newspaper column measurement is about 11 picas wide ‚Äîabout ‚Äîthough this measure varies from paper to paper and in other countries. The examples in this article follow this assumption for illustrative purposes only. Column inches and advertising Newspapers sell advertising space on a page to retail advertisers, advertising agencies and other media buyers. Newspapers publish a \\"per column inch\\" rate based on their circulation and demographic figures. Generally, the more readers the higher the column inch rate is. Newspapers with more affluent readers may be able to command an even higher column inch rate. For most newspapers, however, the published rate is just a starting point. Sales representatives generally negotiate lower rates for frequent advertisers. Advertisements are measured using column inches. An advertisement that is 1 column inch square is 11 picas wide by 1 inch high. The column inch size for advertisements that spread over more than one column is determined by multiplying the number of inches high by number of columns. For example, an advertisement that is 3 columns wide by 6 inches high takes up 18 column inches (3 columns wide multiplied by 6 inches high). To determine the cost of the advertisement, multiply the number of column inches by the newspaper's rate. So, if a newspaper charges $10 per column inch, the cost for the advertisement discussed above would be $180.00 (18 column inches multiplied by $10.00). Advertisements that span over more than one column also gain a small amount of extra space in between columns because they stretch across the gutters. Gutters are the empty space between columns. Gutters range from about 10 points to about 1 pica wide. In addition, most newspapers charge for an extra column if an advertisement is a double truck. Terminology In the newspaper industry, ad and newsroom staffers will refer to an advertisement's size by saying \\"it's a (column width) by (inch height) ad,\\" replacing the words in parentheses () with a single figure. This can be confusing because it refers to two distinct measurements as if they were measured with the same unit. Normally one would think a 3 by 6 advertisement would be 3 inches wide by 6 inches high ‚Äî but in reality it's actually about 5.5 inches wide by 6 inches high. In writing, an \\"√ó\\" is usually used to separate the two figures. Whether written or spoken, most, if not all, newspaper professionals understand the first figure is the column width and the second figure is the inch height. Nowadays, most newspapers and magazines have converted to a \\"modular\\" system that simplifies ad size and eliminates the need to figure out column inches. In a modular system ad sizes are represented by the amount of the total page the ad takes up. For example, 1/2 page, 1/4 page, 1/8 page, etc. This has been a popular system among many newspapers because it simplifies the layout process (i.e. less ad sizes to fit in newspaper) and makes pricing much easier for an advertiser to understand. Use and number of words Column inches are also used as an ad hoc estimate of the importance of a news story and are also used to tell how much copy a reporter should write. This harks back to the paste up days, when in fact newspaper stories used to be printed on long strips of paper that were 1 column wide. The length would vary based on how long the story was. The software used in most present-day newsrooms still measures column inches to give reporters and editors an estimate on how much space a story will take up on a page. Reporters usually refer to story lengths in inches, which actually refers to how many column inches a story takes up. Although it varies, it is generally agreed upon that there are 25-35 words in a column inch. Newsroom staffers also measure items such as photographs and infographics using column inches.

The cancerous T cells in the body initially migrate to the skin, causing various lesions to appear. These lesions change shape as the disease progresses, typically beginning as what appears to be a rash which can be very itchy and eventually forming plaques and tumors before spreading to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms The presentation depends if it is mycosis fungoides or S√©zary syndrome, the most common, though not the only types. Among the symptoms for the aforementioned types are: enlarged lymph nodes, an enlarged liver and spleen, and non-specific dermatitis. Cause The cause of CTCL is unknown. Diagnosis A point-based algorithm for the diagnosis for early forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma was proposed by The International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas in 2005.  Classification  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may be divided into the several subtypes. Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of CTCL and is responsible for half of all cases. A WHO-EORTC classification has been developed. Treatment Romidepsin There is no cure for CTCL, but there are a variety of treatment options available and some CTCL patients are able to live normal lives with this cancer, although symptoms can be debilitating and painful, even in earlier stages. FDA approved treatments include the following: *(1999) Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) *(2000) Bexarotene (Targretin) a retinoid *(2006) Vorinostat (Zolinza) a hydroxymate histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor *(2009) Romidepsin (Istodax) a cyclic peptide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor *(2018) Poteligeo (mogamulizumab-kpkc) Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are shown to have antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties against CTCL.Other (off label) treatments include: In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted orphan drug designation for a topical treatment for pruritus in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to a pharmaceutical company called Elorac.Elorac, Inc. Announces Orphan Drug Designation for Novel Topical Treatment for Pruritus in Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) website Epidemiology Of all cancers involving lymphocytes, 2% of cases are cutaneous T cell lymphomas. CTCL is more common in men and in African-American people. The incidence of CTCL in men is 1.6 times higher than in women. There is some evidence of a relationship with human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) with the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma subtype. No definitive link between any viral infection or environmental factor has been definitely shown with other CTCL subtypes.

Enthroned Madonna and Saints'' Morto da Feltre was an Italian painter of the Venetian school who worked at the close of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th. Biography His real name appears to have been Pietro Luzzo, Pietro LuciStefano Ticozzi Storia dei letterati e degli artisti del Dipartimento della Piave p. XIII. Belluno, 1813 or Lorenzo Luzzo; he is also known by the name Zarato or Zarotto, either from the place of his death or because his father, a surgeon, was in Zara during the son's childhood: whether he was termed \\"Morto\\" (dead) from his joyless temperament is a disputed point. Virgin and Child, Civic Museum of Feltre Born in Feltre (province of Belluno), he may probably have studied painting first in Venice and surroundings, initially an assistant of Pinturicchio. It is claimed by Vasari that at an early age he went to Rome, and investigated the ancient, especially the subterranean remains, and thence to Pozzuoli, where he painted from the decorations of antique crypts or grotte. The style of fanciful arabesque which he formed for himself from these studies gained the name of \\"grottesche\\", whence comes the term grotesque; not, indeed, that Morto was the first painter of arabesque in the Italian Renaissance, for art of this kind had, been developed, both in painting and in sculpture, towards 1480, but he may have powerfully aided its diffusion southwards. His works were received with much favor in Rome. He afterwards went to Florence, and painted some fine grotesques in the Palazzo Pubblico and trained Andrea di Cosimo. Returning to Venice towards 1505, he assisted Giorgione in painting the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and seems to have remained with him till 1510. It may have been in 1515 that Morto returned to his native Feltre, then in a very ruinous condition from the ravages of war in 1509. There he executed various works, including some frescoes, still partly extant, and considered to be almost worthy of the hand of Raphael, in the loggia beside the church of Santo Stefano. He may have met Giovanni da Udine. Towards the age of forty-five, Morto, unquiet and dissatisfied, abandoned painting and took to soldiering in the service of the Venetian republic. He was made captain of a troop of two hundred men; and fighting valorously, he is said to have died at Zara in Dalmatia, in 1519. This story, and especially the date of it, are questionable: there is some reason to think that Morto was painting as late as 1522. One of his pictures is in the Berlin museum, an allegorical subject of Peace and War. Andrea Feltrini was his pupil and assistant as a decorative painter. He is cited in Giorgio Vasari's Vite or biographies of the artists.

A close relative of the 8096, the Intel 8061 is second-sourced by Toshiba (under the model number 6127 and 6126) and Motorola (now Freescale Semiconductor).  Introduction  The MCS-96 family originated as a commercial derivative of the Intel 8061, the first processor in the Ford EEC-IV engine controller family. Differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory interface bus, the 8061's M-Bus being a 'burst- mode' bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices. There were also considerable differences in the I/O peripherals of the two parts - the 8061 had 8 HSI (pulse-measurement) inputs, 10 HSO (pulse-generation) outputs entirely separated from the HSI pins, and a non-sampling 10-bit ADC with more channels than the 8096 had. Many differences between the EEC-IV and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce I/O pin count in favor of using the pins for a more conventional memory interface bus. The 8061 and its derivatives were used in almost all Ford automobiles built from 1983 through the end of the 20th century. This processor controlled fuel mixture and injection timing, spark advance (often in conjunction with a separate spark module), exhaust gas recirculation, and other engine functions.  M-Bus  The 8061 had an interruptible-burst-mode 11-wire 8-bit memory interface bus called the M-Bus. This bus required a program counter and a data address register in each memory device. Each chip reset or branch instruction would update the program counter in the memory devices, after which instruction stream data would be read sequentially. The instruction stream could be interrupted to read or write data bytes and words using the memory's data address register while retaining the memory's program counter copy--allowing resumption of reading the instruction stream without having to re-send a program address after each data access.  Address map  The 8061 had a 240-byte internal register file, from address 0010H to 00FFH. I/O addresses were from 0002H to 000FH. Throughout the 8061 family, address 0000H was reserved for a constant ZERO register. This permitted use of relative addressing to access absolute addresses. The stack pointer was at 00010H. 8061 could address 64K of memory. Reset was to 2000H. Interrupt vectors were at 2010H.  Process, package  The 8061 was built in a 3-micrometre N-MOS silicon-gate process. Plastic 68-pin flatpacks, ceramic packages, and 40-pin DIP packages were used, depending on the I/O pin-count requirements of a particular module design.  Derivatives  Ford created the Ford Microelectronics facility in Colorado Springs in 1982 to propagate the EEC-IV family, develop other custom circuits for use in automobiles, and to explore the Gallium Arsenide integrated circuit market. Parts in that family included the 8063, which never reached production. The family also included the 8065, produced in high volumes, which incorporated a memory controller allowing it to address a 1-megabyte memory, considerably greater than the 64K of the 8061 and 8096. The 8063, 8065 and later EPIC were CMOS derivatives capable of reduced power consumption. The 8065 had an enhanced instruction set, additional register space, and a much-enhanced I/O. As a result, the 8065 had a register file from address 0020H to 03FFH, addressable in 4 banks. I/O addresses were from 0002H to 001FH. The stack pointer was at 00020H.  HSI  The 8061 had an 8-channel event-capture system for measuring and timing pulsed inputs. A 16-bit timer value was captured in a FIFO along with the new state of all 8 pins whenever a transition was detected on an enabled pin. The FIFO was implemented in a small dynamic RAM. The HSI was used, for example, for recording times of crankshaft-position-sensor events, which were used for determining engine speed.  HSO  The 8061 had a 10-channel pulse-generator output system for generating timed outputs. This essentially had a small content-addressable memory (CAM) that compared event times with the same 16-bit timer used for the HSI system. Each event time was written to CAM along with a command. When a match of a CAM location with the timer was found, the event was executed and the CAM location returned to an empty pool. The CAM was simulated with dynamic RAM and a comparator. The HSO was used for a variety of purposes including fuel injection pulse timing.  ADC  The 8061 and its derivatives had a multichannel analog-to-digital converter on the processor chip. This was used for such purposes as sensing engine temperature and throttle angle, and for reading the exhaust-gas oxygen sensor.  Interrupts  The 8061 had an 8-channel vectored priority interrupt system. The later 8065 provided 40 channels, of which 32 were tied into the HSI/HSO event system.  Serial Port  Various members of the 8061 family had a custom serial port on-chip. This was intended as a port expander and not as a general-purpose UART  Companion Memory  The 8061 was used with a family of other devices, including the 8361 - a companion memory having ROM and some RAM. In later modules, one-time-programmable (OTP) EPROM memory was substituted for the original mask-programmed memory - this greatly simplified logistics given the wide variety of ROM codes required in each model year.

Thomas Francis Meagher, MacManus, and Patrick O'Donoghue receiving their sentences of death. Grave of Terence Bellew MacManus in the Fenian Plot, Glasnevin, Dublin. Terence Bellew MacManus (born 1811 or 1823 ‚Äì 15 January 1861) was an Irish rebel who participated in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. Sentenced to death for treason, he and several other participants were given commuted sentences in 1849 and transported for life to Van Diemen's Land in Australia. Three years later in 1852, MacManus escaped and emigrated to the United States. He lived in San Francisco, California until his death in 1861. There he was unable to re- establish his career. His body was returned to Dublin for burial, where the Fenians gave him a large funeral in honor of his part in the rebellion. MacManus was notable for his statement in court in 1848; he explained his actions by saying: \\"...[I]t was not because I loved England less, but because I loved Ireland more.\\" Biography Terence MacManus was born about 1811 (or 1823)\\"Terence Bellew MacManus\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Alfred Webb, 1878 in Tempo, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He was educated in parochial schools. As a young man he moved to Liverpool, a major port, where he became a successful shipping agent. In 1848 he returned to Ireland, where he became active in the Repeal Association, which sought to overturn the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland. After joining the Irish Confederation, he was among those who took part with William Smith O'Brien and John Blake Dillon in the July 1848 Young Irelander Rebellion in Ballingarry, County Tipperary. MacManus and the other leaders were charged and convicted of treason, and sentenced to death for their actions. Due to public support for clemency, the men's sentences were commuted to deportation for life. MacManus was transported to Van Diemen's Land in Tasmania, Australia in 1849 on the Swift, together with O'Brien, Thomas Francis Meagher and Patrick O'Donoghue. They were assigned to different settlements to reduce their collaboration in the new land. However, the Irish men continued to meet secretly.Christine Kinealy, 'Repealand Revolution. 1848 in Ireland', Manchester, 2009. In 1852 MacManus and Meagher escaped from Australia and made their way to San Francisco, California, where MacManus settled. (Meagher went on to New York City.) Like other immigrants, the Irish revolutionaries carried their issues to the United States. Ellis, captain of a ship that was supposed to carry O'Brien to freedom, also emigrated to San Francisco. MacManus held a lynch court of Ellis among Irish emigrants for his betrayal of O'Brien in his escape attempt from Van Diemen's Land. The court martial acquitted Ellis for lack of evidence. Failing to re-establish his career as a shipping agent, MacManus died in poverty around the age of 50. His body was returned to Ireland, here he was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, on 10 November 1861. Fenians organized a huge funeral and nationalist demonstration to honor MacManus.

Born in Zhytomyr, in the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire (in present- day Ukraine), Liptzin had no formal education. She ran away from an arranged marriage, running to Smila, where she was first discovered (originally for her singing voice) and put on stage by Israel Rosenberg in 1880. She originally used the stage name Keni Sonyes, but after marrying theatrical prompter Volodya Liptzin in London in the mid-1880s, she took his last name. After Sonya Adler's death in London in 1886, she played dramatic roles opposite Jacob Adler and joined Adler when he came to America, playing with him in Chicago, before travelling to New York City in 1889, where she played first in the company of Moishe Finkel and David Kessler, then renting her own theater. She was most famous for playing the lead roles in two Jacob Gordin plays, Di shkhite and Mirele Efros, the former an attack on arranged marriage, the latter a story about an embittered matriarch who is finally reconciled again to her family. Abraham Cahan, editor of the Jewish Daily Forward, said of her performance in Mirele Efros, \\"Liptzin's pride, her humor, her shrewdness, come not from Lithuania, but from Shakespeare,\\" describing her as \\"...a Lear... a queen...\\" In her own theater, she also put on works by Victor Hugo, Alphonse Daudet, Gerhart Hauptmann, and Leonid Andreyev.

It is one of Ochs's most somber albums. In stark contrast to his three albums for Elektra Records which had all been folk music, Pleasures of the Harbor featured traces of classical, rock and roll, Dixieland jazz and experimental synthesized music crossing with folk, in hopes of producing a \\"folk-pop\\" crossover. History The best known track is \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\", a sarcastic jab at the apathetic nature of people in certain situations, at its base the story of the Murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City (which numerous people witnessed, doing nothing to help), set to a Dixieland backing. The mention of marijuana in one verse was misinterpreted, and its release as a single failed to do anything on the charts as it was banned from radio play by many stations. \\"The Party\\" savaged high-class snobs, with Ochs taking the role of a lounge pianist, observing the ridiculous nature of their gatherings. \\"Flower Lady\\" was a six- minute narrative about contrasting characters in the city, with each anecdote having one thing in common; everyone ignores the poor woman trying to sell her flowers. \\"Pleasures of the Harbor\\", the title track, is a dirge to lonely sailors seeking human comfort and connection while in port. Ochs composed it after watching a screening of John Ford's 1940 film The Long Voyage Home, which starred one of Ochs' movie idols, John Wayne. It features a lilting melodic line and what some consider to be an overblown film score-like orchestration (supposedly including a young Warren Zevon), a view which Ochs himself would later on come to share. This recording of \\"The Crucifixion\\", which closed the album, was deemed a failed experiment by Ochs, as far as its avant-garde production experiment (by Joseph Byrd) is concerned. Lyrically and musically, however, many consider the song to be Ochs' masterpiece. Its ten verses compare John F. Kennedy and Christ, and explore the \\"cycle of sacrifice\\" where we build up our leaders into heroes so that we can enjoy tearing them down. The song is said to have brought Kennedy's brother Robert to tears when Ochs performed it for him a cappella in early 1968, months before the younger Kennedy's own assassination. All live versions of the song performed in concert featured Ochs alone, with just his guitar and voice, and one of those live performances is on the posthumously released compilations Chords of Fame and Farewells & Fantasies.

The library replaced the State Library of Ohio as the location for the Ohio Center for the Book in 2003.https://lj.libraryjournal.com/2003/11/ljarchives/cleveland-pl-new-state- center-for-the-book/#_ History=Founding In 1811, the idea behind the Cleveland Public Library came \\"out of small beginnings\\" when sixteen of Cleveland's sixty-four residents subscribed to its first library, established to distribute the rare printed book. The members read books such as the history of Rome, Lives of the English Poets, Goldsmith's Greece, and Don Quixote. In 1867, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Dayton Boards of Education petitioned the Ohio General Assembly for authority to levy a tax for the maintenance of free public libraries, permitting boards of education with populations over 20,000 to levy a tax of one-tenth of a mill for each dollar evaluation of their taxable property. Cleveland Superintendent, the Reverend Anson Smyth, who has been doubtfully called the \\"father of the Cleveland Public Library,\\" supported this law in his Superintendent position, helping in the laws' development. The new law provided for a Cleveland library that was part of the school system, controlled by the Cleveland Board of Education throughout the first decade of the library's existence, except for the years 1871-1873. The Cleveland Public Library opened on February 17, 1869 on the third floor of the Northup and Harrington Block on West Superior Avenue, The library room was adjacent to the Cleveland Board of Education, and opened with approximately 5,800 books. Luther Melville Oviatt was the first librarian at Cleveland Public Library from 1869 to 1875. During his first year, patrons borrowed 65,000 books. Forwarding thinking in his views, Oviatt wanted to provide books that would interest both children and adults, the mechanic, businessman, and scholar. He had open shelves because, \\"without a catalog, the only way potential borrowers could ascertain what books were available was to look at them.\\" Oviatt resigned in June, 1875, the victim of governing boards or their subsidiaries, who micromanaged daily operations of the library.

In 1915, the Cleveland architectural firm of Walker and Weeks won a competition to design a new library building. Construction of their classical Renaissance design, delayed by the First World War, began in 1923 under Linda Anne Eastman. Eastman (1867‚Äì1963) was the first woman to head a major U.S. city library system and a pioneer in the modern library system. She opened bookshelves to patrons, replacing the New York Public Library system in which a librarian fetched the books.

The library won passage in November 1957 of a $3 million bond levy to pay for the purchase of the building. The structure was purchased on December 22, 1957, and the new Business and Social Sciences Annex opened on August 24, 1959. The annex was demolished in 1994 to make way for a second building, named after former Representative Louis Stokes, was dedicated on April 12, 1997. Stokes commented, \\"This is the most beautiful that I have ever seen.\\" The $65 million structure of fritted glass panels and Georgia marble housed eight million items and two million titles on its grand opening. The two buildings are connected by underground corridor below the Eastman Reading Garden, which was designed by landscape architecture firm OLIN, and includes sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Otterness.  Special Collections  The Special Collections Department was created through the work of John G. White, who served as president of the Cleveland Public Library Board of Trustees from 1884-1886 and 1913-1928. In addition to donating and purchasing many rare books to the Library, White underwrote the construction of the Fine Arts and Special Collections reading room and the Exhibit Corridor.

Branches Rookwood Installation at Carnegie-West Branch Carnegie-West BranchDuring the 1890s, William Howard Brett opened four self-contained branch libraries in leased buildings. As early as 1891, he asked Andrew Carnegie for building permanent structures, but the steel-mogul-turned-philanthropist refused the librarian's requests for 12 years. Brett persisted and in 1903 Carnegie donated $250,000 to build seven branches, including the Woodland Branch. Carnegie was so impressed with Brett's money management of the funds, he eventually increased the amount to $507,000, which built 15 branches-the foundation for what would become one of the largest branch systems in the United States. Children living in the city's poorest manufacturing districts could not visit the library downtown or the new branches, so William Howard Brett and Miss Eastman put small reading collections in neighborhood homes. By 1913, there were 57 \\"home libraries\\" in seven different working class districts, serving 11 different nationalities: Italian, Greek, Syrian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Slovak, Irish, German, Danish, and Norwegian.Lorain Branch South Branch Currently, the Cleveland Public Library has 27 neighborhood branches located throughout the city in addition to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled: #Addison Branch #Brooklyn Branch #Carnegie-West Branch - the biggest neighborhood branch at #Collinwood Branch #East 131st Street Branch #Eastman Branch #Fleet Branch #Fulton Branch #Garden Valley Branch #Glenville Branch #Harvard-Lee Branch #Hough Branch #Jefferson Branch #Langston Hughes Branch #Lorain Branch #Martin Luther King, Jr. Branch #Memorial-Nottingham Branch - also the location of the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled #Mount Pleasant Branch #Public Administration Library #Rice Branch #Rockport Branch #South Branch #South Brooklyn Branch #Sterling Branch #Union Branch #Walz Branch #West Park Branch #Woodland Branch Sensory Garden at the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically DisabledA Sensory Garden is also adjacent to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled. The garden was first organized in 1998 and was significantly enlarged the following year. The garden features plants specifically for the tactile sensations they provide and unique scents. Revitalization In 2019 the library announced it was undertaking a decade-long $100 million revitalization project to redevelop all 27 branches. The project began with a $4.1 million renovation of the South Branch, which transformed the 1911 Gothic Revival structure into \\"...a light- filled jewel box.\\" After finishing all the branch work, CPL will then begin a $65 million rehabilitation of the downtown Main Library. Phase I-A of the plan, affecting six branches, is scheduled for completion in 2024. Notable Art and Architecture The Public Works of Art Project came to Cleveland in 1933, with far-reaching lines of job-seeking artists extending around the Cleveland Museum of Art. Linda Eastman was invited to consult with Cleveland Museum of Art Director William Milliken. What resulted from this interaction were murals of Willam Sommer's \\"The City in 1833\\", Donald Bayard's \\"Early Transportation\\", and Ora Coltman's \\"The Dominance of the City.\\" Linda Eastman believed if art could lead readers to books, if art could enlighten and educate in itself, than art was acceptable at the Cleveland Public Library. To complete the decoration of Brett Hall, Cleveland Public Library partnered with the Cleveland Area Arts Council to select three new artists to paint new murals for the walls. \\"Sommer's Sun\\" by Edwin Mieczkowski's, Christopher Pekoc's \\"Night Sky\\", and \\"Public Square\\" by Robert Jergens. Terrestrial Globe Hanging from the Main Library entrance hall is a large terrestrial pearl-gray art glass globe made by the Sterling Bronze Company in 1925. This globe is based on a Leonardo da Vinci map, now housed at Windsor Castle. The map is one of earliest to depict the Americas-with North America indicated simply by small islands. The portraits of former members of Congress Louis Stokes and Stephanie Tubbs Jones are housed at the Cleveland Public Library, painted by artist Khaz Ra'el. Recent History In 2002, the Cleveland Public Library had annual attendance of 804,692 and an annual circulation of 1,698,928 items. In 2016, the library's collection totaled 10,557,336 items. The Cleveland Public Library is a member of CLEVNET, a consortium of 44 public libraries throughout northern Ohio. In 1947, it became a depository library for the United Nations Library network, holding documents for the state of Ohio. There are only 400 UN depository libraries worldwide. In 2002, Northern Ohio library patrons had access to download digital books and periodicals through a new e-book system headquartered at Cleveland Public Library. The Clevnet consortium of libraries entered in a $50,000 setup-free agreement with the Cleveland-based company OverDrive to allow patrons to download text from e-books to their personal computer. In 2012, the Library released a strategic plan focusing on communities of learning and preparing for its 150th anniversary in 2019.http://cpl150.org/about/strategic-plan/ Cleveland Public Library launched Tech Central on June 14, 2012, featuring a computer lab with 90 computers, tables encouraging collaboration, a 3D printer, and a MyCloud service. This $1 million launch was funded primarily through the Library's existing budgets, in which the MyCloud service was partially funded through corporate partners. Cleveland Public Library, along with three other Ohio Libraries (Columbus, Toledo, and Cincinnati), opened digitization hubs, with $1 million in funding dispersed among them, funded by Ohio Public Library Information Network and the Library Services Technology Act. The digitization hub at Cleveland Public Library was named the Cleveland Digital Public Library and debuted February 14, 2015. As stated by Chatham Ewing, Cleveland Public Library's Digital Strategist, \\"It's a way for us to strike up some partnerships with local organizations that have historical objects they are interested in stewarding and digitizing.\\" In 2018, Cleveland Public Library was designated an official Digital Access Partner with the Federal Depository Library Program for its digitized multi-volume set of the First United States Army Report of Operations during World War II. Cleveland Public Library celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2019. Events included a street festival, puppet exhibit, and a Writers and Readers author event. Cleveland Print Room partnered with Cleveland Public Library to present photographers chronicling Cleveland through the lens of its communities and Ideastream presented audio stories of Clevelanders.

Datums, Ellipsoids, Grids, and Grid Reference Systems is the geocoordinate standard used by NATO militaries for locating points on Earth. The MGRS is derived from the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system and the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid system, but uses a different labeling convention. The MGRS is used as geocode for the entire Earth. An example of an MGRS coordinate, or grid reference, would be [21_18_34.0_N_157_55_0.7_W_&language;=en 4QFJ12345678], which consists of three parts: * 4Q (grid zone designator, GZD) * FJ (the 100,000-meter square identifier) * 12345678 (numerical location; easting is 1234 and northing is 5678, in this case specifying a location with 10 m resolution) An MGRS grid reference is a point reference system. When the term 'grid square' is used, it can refer to a square with a side length of , 1 km, , 10 m or 1 m, depending on the precision of the coordinates provided. (In some cases, squares adjacent to a Grid Zone Junction (GZJ) are clipped, so polygon is a better descriptor of these areas.) The number of digits in the numerical location must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, depending on the desired precision. When changing precision levels, it is important to truncate rather than round the easting and northing values to ensure the more precise polygon will remain within the boundaries of the less precise polygon. Related to this is the primacy of the southwest corner of the polygon being the labeling point for an entire polygon. In instances where the polygon is not a square and has been clipped by a grid zone junction, the polygon keeps the label of the southwest corner as if it had not been clipped. * 4Q .....................GZD only, precision level 6¬∞ √ó 8¬∞ (in most cases) * 4QFJ ...................GZD and 100 km Grid Square ID, precision level 100 km * 4QFJ 1 6 ...............precision level 10 km * 4QFJ 12 67 .............precision level 1 km * 4QFJ 123 678 ...........precision level 100 m * 4QFJ 1234 6789 .........precision level 10 m * 4QFJ 12345 67890 .......precision level 1 m Grid zone designation UTM zones on an equirectangular world map with irregular zones in red and New York City's zone highlighted The first part of an MGRS coordinate is the grid-zone designation. The 6¬∞ wide UTM zones, numbered 1‚Äì60, are intersected by latitude bands that are normally 8¬∞ high, lettered C‚ÄìX (omitting I and O). The northmost latitude band, X, is 12¬∞ high. The intersection of a UTM zone and a latitude band is (normally) a 6¬∞ √ó 8¬∞ polygon called a grid zone, whose designation in MGRS is formed by the zone number (one or two digits ‚Äì the number for zones 1 to 9 is just a single digit, according to the example in DMA TM 8358.1, Section 3-2, Figure 7), followed by the latitude band letter (uppercase). This same notation is used in both UTM and MGRS, i.e. the UTM grid reference system; the article on Universal Transverse Mercator shows many maps of these grid zones, including the irregularities for Svalbard and southwest Norway. As Figure 1 illustrates, Honolulu is in grid zone 4Q. Figure 1. The origin of the MGRS grid, in the Pacific. Honolulu is in 4QFJ. 100,000-meter square identification The second part of an MGRS coordinate is the 100,000-meter square identification. Each UTM zone is divided into 100,000 meter squares, so that their corners have UTM-coordinates that are multiples of 100,000 meters. The identification consists of a column letter (A‚ÄìZ, omitting I and O) followed by a row letter (A‚ÄìV, omitting I and O). Near the equator, the columns of UTM zone 1 have the letters A‚ÄìH, the columns of UTM zone 2 have the letters J‚ÄìR (omitting O), and the columns of UTM zone 3 have the letters S‚ÄìZ. At zone 4, the column letters start over from A, and so on around the world. For the row letters, there are actually two alternative lettering schemes within MGRS: * In the AA scheme, NGA Guidance for the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). also known as MGRS-New,Military Map Reading 201, published by NGA which is used for WGS84 and some other modern geodetic datums, the letter for the first row ‚Äì just north of the equator ‚Äì is A in odd-numbered zones, and F in even-numbered zones, as shown in figure 1. Note that the westmost square in this row, in zone 1, has identification AA. * In the alternative AL scheme, also known as MGRS-Old, which is used for some older geodetic datums, the row letters are shifted 10 steps in the alphabet. This means that the letter for the first row is L in odd-numbered zones and R in even-numbered zones. The westmost square in the first row, in zone 1, has identification AL. If an MGRS coordinate is complete (with both a grid zone designation and a 100,000 meter square identification), and is valid in one lettering scheme, then it is usually invalid in the other scheme, which will have no such 100,000 meter square in the grid zone. (Latitude band X is the exception to this rule.) Therefore, a position reported in a modern datum usually can not be misunderstood as using an old datum, and vice versa ‚Äì provided the datums use different MGRS lettering schemes. In the map (figure 1), which uses the AA scheme, we see that Honolulu is in grid zone 4Q, and square FJ. To give the position of Honolulu with 100 km resolution, we write 4QFJ. Figure 2. The MGRS grid around Hawaii. Honolulu is in the 10 km square that is called 4QFJ15. Numerical location The third part of an MGRS coordinate is the numerical location within a 100,000 meter square, given as n + n digits, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If 5 + 5 digits is used, the first 5 digits give the easting in meters, measured from the left edge of the square, and the last 5 digits give the northing in meters, measured from the bottom edge of the square. The resolution in this case is 1 meter, so the MGRS coordinate would represent a 1-meter square, where the easting and northing are measured to its southwest corner. If a resolution of 10 meters is enough, the final digit of the easting and northing can be dropped, so that only 4 + 4 digits are used, representing a 10-meter square. If a 100-meter resolution is enough, 3 + 3 digits suffice; if a 1 km resolution is enough, 2 + 2 digits suffice; if 10 km resolution is enough, 1 + 1 digits suffice. 10 meter resolution (4 + 4 digits) is sufficient for many purposes, and is the NATO standard for specifying coordinates. If we zoom in on Hawaii (figure 2), we see that the square that contains Honolulu, if we use 10 km resolution, would be written 4QFJ15. If the grid zone or 100,000-meter square are clear from context, they can be dropped, and only the numerical location is specified. For example: *If every position being located is within the same grid zone, only the 100,000-meter square and numerical location are specified. *If every position being located is within the same grid zone and 100,000-meter square, only the numerical location is specified. *However, even if every position being located is within a small area, but the area overlaps multiple 100,000-meter squares or grid zones, the entire grid reference is required. One always reads map coordinates from west to east first (easting), then from south to north (northing). Common mnemonics include \\"in the house, up the stairs\\", \\"left-to-right, bottom-to-top\\" and \\"Read Right Up\\". Truncate, don't round As mentioned above, when converting UTM coordinates to an MGRS grid reference, or when abbreviating an MGRS grid reference to lower precision, one should truncate the coordinates, not round. This has been controversial in the past, since the oldest specification, TM8358.1, used rounding, as did GEOTRANSGEOTRANS Geographic Translator software and source code from the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. before version 3.0. However, truncation is used in GEOTRANS since version 3.0, and in NGA Military Map Reading 201 (page 5) and in the US Army Field Manual 3-25.26.Map Reading and Land Navigation, U.S. Army Field Manual No. 3-25.26 (see section 4-6). The civilian version of MGRS, USNG, also uses truncation.J. Anthony Cavell, USNG: Getting it right the first time. The American Surveyor, June 2005. Squares that cross a latitude band boundary The boundaries of the latitude bands are parallel circles (dashed black lines in figure 1), which do not coincide with the boundaries of the 100,000-meter squares (blue lines in figure 1). For example, at the boundary between grid zones 1P and 1Q, we find a 100,000-meter square BT, of which about two thirds is south of latitude 16¬∞ and therefore in grid zone 1P, while one third is north of 16¬∞ and therefore in 1Q. So, an MGRS grid reference for a position in BT should begin with 1PBT in the south part of BT, and with 1QBT in the north part of BT. At least, this is possible if the precision of the grid reference is enough to place the denoted area completely inside either 1P or 1Q. But an MGRS grid reference can denote an area that crosses a latitude band boundary. For example, when describing the entire square BT, should it be called 1PBT or 1QBT? Or when describing the 1000-meter square BT8569, should it be called 1PBT8569 or 1QBT8569? In these cases, software that interprets an MGRS grid reference should accept both of the possible latitude band letters. A practical motivation was given in the release notes for GEOTRANS, Release 2.0.2, 1999: > The MGRS module was changed to make the final latitude check on MGRS to UTM > conversions sensitive to the precision of the input MGRS coordinate string. > The lower the input precision, the more \\"slop\\" is allowed in the final check > on the latitude zone letter. This is to handle an issue raised by some F-16 > pilots, who truncate MGRS strings that they receive from the Army. This > truncation can put them on the wrong side of a latitude zone boundary, > causing the truncated MGRS string to be considered invalid. The correction > causes truncated strings to be considered valid if any part of the square > which they denote lies within the latitude zone specified by the third > letter of the string. Polar regions Figure 3. The MGRS grid around the South Pole. Figure 4. The MGRS grid around the North Pole. In the polar regions, a different convention is used.DMA Technical Manual 8358.1, Appendix B. Datums, Ellipsoids, Grids, and Grid Reference Systems. South of 80¬∞S, UPS South (Universal Polar Stereographic) is used instead of a UTM projection. The west half-circle forms a grid zone with designation A; the east half-circle forms one with designation B; see figure 3. North of 84¬∞N, UPS North is used, and the west half-circle is Y, the east one is Z; see figure 4. Since the letters A, B, Y, and Z are not used for any latitude bands of UTM, their presence in an MGRS coordinate, with the omission of a zone number, indicates that the coordinates are in the UPS system. The lettering scheme for 100,000 m squares is slightly different in the polar regions. The column letters use a more restricted alphabet, going from A to Z but omitting D, E, I, M, N, O, V, W; the columns are arranged so that the rightmost column in grid zone A and Y has column letter Z, and the next column in grid zone B or Z starts over with column letter A. The row letters go from A to Z, omitting I and O. The restricted column alphabet for UPS ensures that no UPS square will be adjacent to a UTM square with the same identification. In the polar regions, there is only one version of the lettering scheme.

Spanos was a Distinguished Professor of English and comparative literature at Binghamton University, Binghamton, New York; he was a founder and editor of the critical journal boundary 2. His work draws heavily on the philosophical legacy of Martin Heidegger, and while it does show the influence of the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man, Spanos's vocabulary and concepts remain closer to Heidegger's Destruktion (\\"destruction\\") of metaphysics than to its philosophical successors. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1964. Spanos takes a post-modern approach to the West, globalization, colonization, and general interventionist foreign policy. He talks about a problem/solution mindset that America was in during the Vietnam War, and how all foreign policy now is still stuck in this framework. Spanos' work derives from philosophers ranging from Heidegger and Nietzsche to Foucault. Spanos was born in Newport, New Hampshire, the son of Greek immigrants. A veteran of World War II, he was captured during the Battle of the Bulge and taken a prisoner of war to Dresden, Germany. There he survived the Allied firebombing of the city. It was a singular experience that he only recounted fifty years later in his autobiographical book, In the Neighborhood of Zero.

In the early 1990s he suffered a series of crushing blows‚Äîa fire that destroyed all of his belongings, the break-up of his marriage, and a car accident that left him with a broken neck. Once recovered, but alone and unemployed, he was forced to live in a tent in Jackson Hot Springs, just outside Ashland, Oregon, collecting and recycling aluminium cans in order to eat. At the time, he thought his life had come to an end. Despondent, he began his writings after working his way out of homelessness and following a stint as a radio talk show host.Edgar John Burns, Foundations of a Global Spiritual Awakening, AuthorHouse, 2003, , His first book, Conversations with God, was published in 1995 and became an international bestseller.

Gannon, born James Dale Guckert, resigned from Talon on February 8, 2005. The Talon News website was shut down February 23, 2005, but was later revived as a parody. Organization A virtual organization with no physical office space or newsroom, Talon News was owned by a conservative activist group called GOPUSA. Robert Eberle, the president and CEO of GOPUSA, held both titles for Talon News as well. According to Media Matters, \\"Talon News apparently consists of little more than (Robert) Eberle, (Jeff) Gannon, and a few volunteers, and is virtually indistinguishable from GOPUSA.com.What is Talon News, and why does it have press credentials?The White House Stages Its 'Daily Show' Initially, Talon News made its articles available on their website, but in September 2004,TALONNEWS at archive.org (September 24, 2004) moved them to GOPUSA.com and simply re-directed visitors asking for the full news articles there with the statement \\"This story can be found on our #1 client ‚Äî GOPUSA!\\".

Bush how he would work with Democrats who had \\"divorced themselves from reality.\\"Talon News \\"reporter\\" lobs Bush another softball; is Talon a news organization or an arm of the Republican Party?Doubts on White House Reporter Are Recalled Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin noted in his February 19, 2004, column that \\"Within the press corps, Gannon is known for asking softball questions.\\" Media Matters also discovered that the Talon News operation seemed as more of an arm of the PAC GOPUSA than a legitimate journalistic enterprise. Both groups were run out of the same address (Eberle's home), Talon News items were culled from the GOPUSA website, and Talon News \\"journalists\\" lacked significant journalistic experience but had a lengthy history in conservative activism. The Standing Committee of Correspondents rejected Gannon's application for a Capitol Hill press pass because of Talon News' lack of independence from a political organization. Committee chairman Jim Drinkard wrote in his letter: :The application for accreditation to the press galleries states that \\"members of the press shall not engage in lobbying or paid advertising, publicity, promotion, work for any individual, political party, corporation, organization, or agency of the Federal Government.\\" Talon News has not demonstrated to the satisfaction of the committee that there is a separation from GOPUSA/Millions of Americans.com.Gannongate: It's worse than you think Jeff Gannon/James Guckert Gannon submitted his resignation from Talon News effective February 8, 2005.

He is best known for his film Bagdad Caf√©. He is associated with the New German Cinema movement. Early life Adlon was born in Munich, Germany. He grew up in Ammerland/Starnberger See. He studied art, theater history, and German literature at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University; took acting and singing classes; and was a member of the student theater group. Career Percy's films are shown and compete regularly at international film festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Berlin International Film Festival, and others. He started his professional career as an actor, became interested in radio work, was a narrator and editor of literature series and a presenter and voice-over actor in television for 10 years. In 1970, he made his first short film for Bavarian television, followed by more than 150 documentary films about art and the human condition. His first one-hour portrait Tomi Ungerer's Landleben started a very successful co- operation with Benigna von Keyserlingk who became Adlon's television producer of documentaries and feature films. Their first feature film C√©leste, drew international attention at Cannes in 1981. Bagdad Cafe (1987) started their co-operation with Dietrich v. Watzdorf (Bayerischer Rundfunk). The story of Jasmin M√ºnchgstettner and the Caf√© owner Brenda was an international hit. Marianne S√§gebrecht whom Percy Adlon discovered in 1979 became a cult figure, and he developed songs with Tony, Oscar, and Grammy award nominated Bob Telson on such songs as \\"Calling You\\" a classic. Percy and Eleonore Adlon have won numerous awards, including top honors in Rio de Janeiro for Bagdad Cafe, and in Montreal for Salmonberries, two C√©sars, the Ernst-Lubitsch-Award, a Norwegian Amanda Award, the Swedish and the Danish Academy awards, the Prix Humanum, Belgium, prizes in Venice, Chicago, Valladolid, Brussels, Tokyo as well as Bavarian and German Federal Film Awards, among others. Percy Adlon is the recipient of the Officer's Cross of the Federal Republic of Germany, and a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Currently he is working on his new film, Thank You, Thank You. This is the first time that Percy is directing a film he did not write himself. Personal life Percy is the great-grandson of Lorenz Adlon, the founder of the Hotel Adlon. Percy was the grandson of Louis Adlon, Sr., who had five children with his first wife Tilly. After almost 15 years of marriage, he met a hotel guest, the German- American Hedwig Leythen (1889‚Äì1967), called Hedda, at a New Year's Eve party in the Hotel Adlon, left his wife and children, and in 1922 he married her. It was one of the biggest scandals of Berlin in the 1920s. Tilly moved with her daughter Elisabeth, then two, to the south of Germany, while the other children Susanne Adlon-Meyerh√∂fer (mother of Percy), Lorenz, and twins Carl and Louis (junior) were sent to boarding school and later all four emigrated to America. He grew up in the Bavarian countryside with his mother, Susanne Adlon-Meyerh√∂fer and attributes the strong, often unconventional, women's roles in his films to his being brought up in this manner. His son, Felix, an accomplished director in his own right, is the former husband of American actress Pamela Adlon and the father of her three daughters, including actresses Odessa and Gideon Adlon. Percy and Eleonore Adlon live in Pacific Palisades, California.PercyAdlon.com Official bio is a half-brother of Percy, 15 years younger and son of Emil Meyerh√∂fer.

Riverbend's existence and identity remain a mystery, but the weblog entries suggest that she is a young Iraqi woman from a mixed Shia and Sunni family, living with her parents and brother in Baghdad. Before the United States occupation of Iraq she was a computer programmer. She writes in an idiomatic English with, as James Ridgeway notes in the introduction to the Feminist Press edition of her work, \\"a slight American inflection.\\" This has led to some controversy over her identity, as some claim she is an American who used a pseudonym to express their thoughts on U.S. involvement in Iraq. These concerns increased when a blogger did try to imitate the young blogger by creating a blog and using the name riverSbend to confuse those who followed the original blog. Riverbend talked about this blogger and corrected the narrative in her blog post on Wednesday, October 29, 2003. Riverbend's blog combines political statements with a large dose of Iraqi cultural information, such as the celebration of Ramadhan and examples of Iraqi cuisine. In March 2006, her website received the Bloggie award for Best Middle East and Africa blog. On April 26, 2007 Riverbend announced that she and her family would be leaving Iraq, owing to the lack of security in Baghdad and the ongoing violence there. On September 6, 2007 she reported that she had arrived safely in Syria. Her last \\"regular\\" entry was on October 22, 2007 after a gruelling exit from and return to Syria to have her passport stamped as a \\"temporary visitor.\\" On April 9, 2013 she updated her blog with a post \\"Ten Years On,\\" in which she said she had moved on from Syria \\"before the heavy fighting, before it got ugly\\" and considered herself fortunate. She was a year in another country and moved again to a third Arab country \\"with the hope that, this time, it'll stick until... Until when? Even the pessimists aren't sure anymore. When will things improve? When will be able to live normally? How long will it take?\\" She shared reflections on what Iraqis had learned in the ten years since the Fall of Baghdad. There have been no further entries at her blog. Publishing Riverbend's weblog entries were first collected and published as Baghdad Burning, (with a foreword by investigative journalist James Ridgeway), and Baghdad Burning II, , (also with an introduction by James Ridgeway and Jean Casella). They have since been translated and published in numerous countries and languages. In 2005, the book Baghdad Burning won third place for the Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage and in 2006 it was longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize. Baghdad Burning has also been made into several dramatic plays, mostly produced in New York City. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a five-episode dramatization of her blog, \\"Baghdad Burning\\", on the \\"Woman's Hour\\" Serial, on each day from the 18th of December, 2006 until the 22nd of December, 2006.

Background Recorded in the aftermath of Ochs's presence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (where Ochs claimed to have witnessed the symbolic \\"death of America\\") it is often considered to be the darkest of Ochs's albums, exemplified not just by the lyrical matter but also by its cover: a tombstone sardonically proclaiming that Ochs had died in Chicago. Rehearsals for Retirement saw Ochs exploring folk rock, incorporating orchestral accompaniments and electric guitar into his music. According to English studies scholar David Pichaske, songs such as \\"Pretty Smart on My Part\\" and \\"The Scorpion Departs but Never Returns\\" functioned as \\"art-protest songs\\". The former was written from the perspective of a John Birch Society member who is paranoid of switchblade-toting thieves, foreign operatives, dissident hitchhikers, and dominant, large-breasted women, and acts on this paranoia by killing them and others with a rifle and his friends from the NRA. Pichaske interpreted the narrative as a psychological analysis finding insecurity to be the source of violence in the United States. The latter song used the 1968 disappearance of the Scorpion nuclear submarine as an allegory for a modern \\"Lost Generation\\" who abandon the U.S. in response to the Vietnam War. Reception Rehearsals for Retirement was the poorest-selling of all of Ochs's albums released during his lifetime, having been deleted from the A&M; Records catalog before sales of 20,000 units had occurred. Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1969, Robert Christgau said the musical arrangements are \\"excellent and work for [Ochs'] voice\\". While observing \\"some predictable bummers\\", Christgau highlighted two flashes of greatness with \\"The Scorpion Departs But Never Returns\\" and \\"Another Age\\".

Nicknamed Chaika (', \\"Seagull\\") because of its gulled upper wings,Gunston 1995, p. 299.Green and Swanborough 1979, p. 10. it was operated in large numbers by the Soviet Air Force, and together with the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane, was one of the standard fighters of the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, where it was called Chato (snub-nose).Lannon 2002, p. 46. Design and development The design for the 14th fighter for the VVS, the I-14, started as an advanced (for the era) monoplane under the direction of Andrei Tupolev. He grew concerned that the design would not mature, and ordered two backup biplane designs as the I-14A and B just to be safe. Polikarpov had just been released from prison in August 1932, and was handed the I-14A project. When both the I-14 and I-14A were ordered into production, Polikarpov's design, a development of the I-5 fighter became the famous I-15. The first flight was made in October 1933 with V.P. Chkalov at the controls, powered by an imported Wright R-1820 Cyclone engine.Green and Swanborough 1979, p. 9. The I-15, also known by its development name TsKB-3, was a small biplane fighter with a gulled upper wing. The single bay wings were of wooden construction, while the fuselage was of mixed steel and duralumin construction, with a fabric covered rear fuselage. Production started in 1934, initially being powered by the Shvetsov M-22, a license-built version of the Bristol Jupiter radial engine. While less powerful than the Cyclone, the M-22 powered aircraft were still superior to the I-5 which it replaced, demonstrating excellent manoeuvrability. Production switched to the 515 kW (700 hp) Shvetsov M-25 engine (a license-built, metricated Cyclone) in late 1936. A total of 671 I-15s were built, 284 in the Soviet Union and a further 287 under license by CASA in Spain.Gordon and Dexter 1999, p. 120. The gulled upper wing of the I-15 was unpopular with some pilots, as it was felt to restrict visibility, so Polikarpov's design bureau produced a revised version, again powered by the M-25, with a longer span un-gulled upper wing. This version, the I-15bis, commenced production in 1937,Green and Swanborough 1979, p. 18. a total of 2,408 I-15bis' being delivered by the time production finished in 1940. Operational history=China In August 1937, the Chinese Kuomintang Government signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR. And, in autumn of the same year, the Soviet Union commenced to ship I-15s as a part of a programme of military aid to the Chinese Air Force (CAF) in its defensive war against Japan. More than 250 Soviet pilots volunteered to fly the 255 I-15s supplied to China in autumn 1937. By 1939, the total number of Polikarpov biplanes delivered to CAF reached 347 I-15/I-15bis.Maslov 2010, p. 33. The I-15bis saw a great amount of action in the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts along the China‚ÄìMongolia border. In 1937, I-15s in the hands of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force fought against invading Japanese, where the tough biplane began to meet its match in some of the newer, faster Japanese monoplanes. Mongolia In 1939 Polikarpov fighters were extensively used during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought around the Khalkha River in Dornod Province. The battles were fought during 11 May‚Äì16 September 1939, and involved more than 600 planes. When hostilities commenced, the only I-15bis in the area were 14 aircraft of 70th IAP. Their number increased in the following weeks: on 23 May, 35 I-15bis from 22nd IAP arrived from the Trans-Baikal region. However the Polikarpov pilots had been hastily trained and they suffered heavy losses against the more experienced Japanese. During this conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan lost more than 200 aircraft each.Maslov 2010, p. 42. 10 aircraft were delivered to the Mongolian People's Army Air Force in mid-July 1939 and flight personnel were trained for rear air defence. Afterwards, they received more than 30 aircraft in March 1942. Spain The I-15 was used extensively in combat by the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and proved to be one of the best fighter biplanes of its time. The Nationalists called the fighter \\"Curtiss\\", apparently believing it to be the Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk. The first batch of 25 Polikarpovs arrived in Cartagena, Spain, on 28 October 1936, with 15 pilots, led by future ace Pavel Rychagov. A few days later a further group of 10 pilots and 15 aircraft arrived in Bilbao.Maslov 2010, p. 16. The Soviet pilots first went into action 4 November, when I-15s shot down two Junkers Ju 52/3ms and two CR.32s over Madrid, and forced a third Ju 52 and a Heinkel two-seater to crash-land. No losses were reported among the Soviet pilots. During the next two days, Chato pilots claimed 12 more victories, at the cost of two I-15s lost.Maslov 2010, p. 18. On 16 November, while dogfighting with Fiat CR.32s over Madrid, future ace Rychagov was shot down Maslov 2010, p. 17. and four days later the number of combat-ready Polikarpov in the central area had fallen to 15 aircraft: seven had been lost in combat, two had force-landed and one was undergoing repair. In December 1936 and January 1937, two more shipments of 30 aircraft arrived in Spain, making it possible to form four full-strength I-15 squadrons. Until the spring of 1937, central Spain was the main war theatre for I-15s. And in May 1937, another batch of 31 Polikarpov landed in Spain, taking the total number of I-15s delivered to 116.Maslov 2010, p. 21. Chato losses in the Spanish Civil War were comparable to those of its principal rival, the Fiat CR.32. By 1 January 1939, 197 Polikarpovs had been lost: 88 shot down by enemy aircraft and nine by anti-aircraft artillery, 27 destroyed on the ground and 67 written off in accidents.Maslov 2010, p. 24. World War II More than 1,000 I-15bis fighters were still in Soviet use during the German invasion when the biplane was employed in the ground attack role. By late 1942, all I-15s and I-15bis' were relegated to second line duties. Variants I-15bis flying replica, Monino, 2004.

He died about a year later due to illness.  Biography  Lachit Borphukan was the son of Momai Tamuli Borbarua, the first Borbarua (Phu-Ke-Lung) of upper-Assam and Commander-in-Chief of the Ahom army) under Prataap Singha. His mother's name was Kunti Moran. He was born in Charaideo to a Tai Ahom family. Lachit Borphukan was educated in Humanities, indigenous scriptures and military skills. He was given the responsibility of serving as the Soladhara Barua (scarf-bearer) of the Ahom Swargadeo, a position equivalent to a Private Secretaryship, which was regarded as the first step for a career as an ambitious diplomat or politician. Other offices held by Lachit before his appointment as Borphukan included Superintendent of the Stable of Royal Horses (Ghora Barua), Commander of the strategic Simulgarh Fort and Superintendent of the Royal Household Guards (Dolakaxaria Barua) for King Chakradhwaj Singha. King Chakradhwaj Singha selected Lachit Borphukan to lead the forces of the Kingdom of Ahom to liberate Guwahati from Mughal- occupation. The King presented Lachit with a gold-hafted sword (Hengdang) and the customary paraphernalia of distinction. Lachit raised the army and preparations were completed by summer of 1667. Lachit recovered Guwahati from the Mughals and successfully defended it against the Mughal forces during the Battle of Saraighat. Lachit Borphukan died about a year after the victory at Saraighat due to natural causes. His remains lie in rest at the Lachit Maidaam constructed in 1672 by Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha at Hoolungapara 16 km from Jorhat. There is no portrait of Lachit Barphukan, but an old chronicle does provide a physical description:  Battle of Saraighat  35-feet-high statue of Ahom general Lachit Borphukan and his army in the middle of the Brahmaputra. After being defeated by Lachit and his forces, the Mughals army sailed up the Brahmaputra river from Dhaka towards Assam advancing to Guwahati. The Mughal Army under Ram Singh I consisted of 30,000 infantry, 15,000 archers, 18,000 Turkish cavalry, 5,000 gunners and over 1000 cannons besides a large flotilla of boats. Ram Singh, the Mughal commander in chief failed to make any advance against the Assamese army during the first phase of the war. An arrow carrying a letter by Ram Singh telling that Lachit have been paid rupees one lakh and he should evacuate Guwahati was fired into the Ahom camp, which eventually reached the Ahom king, Chakradhwaj Singha. Although the king started to doubt Lachit's sincerity and patriotism, his prime minister Atan Buragohain convinced the King this was just a trick against Lachit. During the last stage of the Battle of Saraighat, when the Mughals attacked by the river in Saraighat, the Assamese soldiers began to lose their will to fight. Some elements retreated. Though Lachit was seriously ill he boarded a boat and with seven boats advanced against the Mughal fleet. He said: \\"If you (the soldiers) want to flee, flee. The king has given me a task here and I will do it well. Let the Mughals take me away. You report to the king that his general fought well following his orders\\". His soldiers rallied and a desperate battle ensured on the river Brahmaputra. Lachit Borphukan was victorious. The Mughals were forced to retreat from Guwahati. The Mughal Commander-in-Chief, acknowledging his defeat by the Ahom soldiers and their Commander-in-chief Lachit Barphukan, wrote: Memorial & monuments National Defense Academy. Lachit Divas On 24 November each year Lachit Divas (Lachit Day) is celebrated statewide in Assam to commemorate the heroism of Lachit Borphukan and the victory of the Assamese army at the Battle of Saraighat. Lachit Divas is celebrated to promote the ideals of Lachit Borphukan ‚Äì the legendary general of Assam's history. Sarbananda Sonowal, the chief minister of Assam took part in the Lachit Divas celebration at the statue of Lachit Borphukan at Brahmaputra riverfront on 24 November 2017. Sonowal stated the first countrywide celebration of ‚ÄòLachit Divas‚Äô would take place in New Delhi followed by state capitals such as Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kolkata in a phased manner. Lachit Borphukan Gold Medal (Best Cadet of NDA) The best passing out cadet of National Defence Academy is conferred the Lachit Borphukan gold medal every year from 1999, after the then Indian Army chief General V P Malik made the formal announcement about its institution in New Delhi on 24 April 1999 at an all-India level national seminar & lecture programme organised at the initiative of a Guwahati-based organisation founded by Assam's leading heritage scholar and former top Indian bureaucrat Principal Bhabananda Deka and columnist, storywriter, novelist Arnab Jan Deka. Assam Foundation-India under the leadership of its founder- member and director Principal Bhabananda Deka and executive director Arnab Jan Deka were primarily instrumental in presenting the 17th century Assamese Army General Lachit Borphukan at the pan-Indian level for the very first time by organizing the said seminar & lecture program in New Delhi on 24 April 1999. At the invitation of Arnab Jan Deka, the incumbent Vice President of India Dr Krishna Kant, Indian Army chief General V P Malik, India Government's Home Secretary B P Singh attended the Assam Foundation programme and delivered research based lectures acknowledging Lachit's military prowess as army general. ‚ÄòThe Assam Tribune‚Äô on its issue dated 25 April 1999 under a caption \\"Heroic feats of Lachit recalled\\" reported from New Delhi that \\"A lecture on the life and times of Lachit Barphukan organized by Assam Foundation involving leading political figures, historians, bureaucrats and Army officers today sought to place the great Ahom general at the centre-stage by bringing out his feats and deeds of brevity outside of Assam. The Chief of the Army Staff, V P Malik, who was present at the lecture today perhaps to remove the shortcoming of historians, agreeing in principle, had instituted a Lachit Barphukan prize at the National Defence Academy. The move, it was felt, will promote awareness about Lachit among the officers of the Defence services and inspire them to emulate his great example. Earlier, the function was inaugurated by Vice President, K Kant who said that leadership of Barphukan as an Ahom general was a great whatershed in the political history of Assam. Addressing the function, the Union Home Secretary B P Singh said that whenever great politician, military leaders and patriots meet, great events happen of which the country saw glimpses in Lachit's life.\\" Almost all leading Indian newspapers like Hindustan Times, The Hindu, The Telegraph extensively covered this event in their national editions published from New Delhi on 25 April 1999. Press Trust of India (PTI) report published on Hindustan Times and others also reported that Assam chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and governor S K Sinha \\"thanked the Army Chief General V P Malik, for agreeing in principle to institute a ‚ÄòLachit Barphukan Prize‚Äô at the National Defence Academy saying this would inspire defence personnel to emulate Barphukan's heroism and sacrifices.\\" The main organizer of the historic event Arnab Jan Deka recalled the proceedings of the event leading to institution of Lachit Barphukan Award and Statue at the India government's top army school through a write-up published in 1 September 2016 issue of the top Assamese literary journal ‚ÄòPrantik‚Äô, wherein the news published in leading dailies like Hindustan Times, The Hindu and The Assam Tribune regarding the event had been extensively quoted. The announcement of institution of the award by Indian Army chief General Malik on 25 April 1999 at the Delhi programme in presence of India's vice-president and other dignitaries was the pivot to perpetuate the memory of Lachit Borphukan at the national level for the very first time. Battalion Cadet Adjutant Aaditya Udupa, 126th NDA Course,was awarded the medal for the Spring Term 2014 on 28 May 2014. Mahabir Lachit Award An award is presented to notable personalities of Assam by Tai Ahom Yuva Parishad. Some of recipients are: Lt. Gen (retd.) S.K. Sinha (2012), Bhugeswar Baruah (2013), Capt. Jintu Gogoi - posthumously (2014), Jadav Payang (2015), Dr. Pushpadhar Gogoi and Dr. Hiren Gohain (2016). The award includes cash amount of ‚Çπ50,000.00, a citation and a traditional sword. Lachit Borphukan's Maidam Lachit Borphukan's Maidam was constructed in memory of Lachit Borphukan at Jorhat, Assam. It is 8 km far from the famous Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary. Here last remains of Borphukan were laid under this tomb (Maidam) constructed by Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha in 1672.

Meyer's philosophy was presented in two books, primarily In Defense of Freedom: A Conservative Credo (1962) and also in a collection of his essays, The Conservative Mainstream (1969). Fusionism has been summed up by E. J. Dionne, Jr. as \\"utilizing libertarian means in a conservative society for traditionalist ends.\\"E. J. Dionne, Jr., Why Americans Hate Politics, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p. 161. Personal life Meyer was born to a prominent business family of German Jewish descent in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Helene (Straus) and Jack F. Meyer.https://issuu.com/renatos.grun/docs/in_defense_of_freedom He attended Princeton University for one year and then transferred to Balliol College at Oxford University, where he earned his B.A. in 1932 and his M.A. in 1934. He later studied at the London School of Economics and became the student union's president before he was expelled and deported in 1933 for his communist activism.William C. Dennis \\"Foreword\\" in Frank S. Meyer, In Defense of Freedom and Other Essays, Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1996 Like a number of the founding senior editors of National Review magazine, Meyer was first a Communist Party USA apparatchik before he converted to political conservatism. His experiences as a communist are reported in his book The Moulding of Communists: The Training of the Communist Cadre in 1961. He began an \\"agonizing reappraisal of his communist beliefs\\" after he had read F. A. Hayek's The Road to Serfdom while he served in the US Army during World War II, and he made a complete break in 1945, after 14 years in active leadership service to the Communist Party and its cause.Dennis, pp. xii‚Äìxiii Following the war, he contributed articles to the early free market periodical The Freeman, and he later joined the original staff of National Review in 1955. After completing his turn to the right, Meyer became a close adviser to and confidant of William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder and editor of National Review, who, in the introduction to Buckley's book Did You Ever See a Dream Walking: American Conservative Thought in the 20th Century (1970), gave Meyer the credit for properly synthesizing the traditionalist and libertarian strains in conservatism, starting at the magazine itself.p. xxxiii Meyer wrote a column \\"Principles and Heresies,\\" which appeared in each issue of the magazine; was its book review editor; and acted as a major spokesman for its principles. Meyer married the former Elsie Bown. They had two sons, John Cornford Meyer, a lawyer, and then Eugene Bown Meyer, who became a president of the Federalist Society. Both sons hold international titles in chess. John is a FIDE Master, and Eugene holds the rank of International Master, just below Grandmaster. Meyer converted to Catholicism just before he died of lung cancer in 1972. Meyer was known in conservative and libertarian circles for his nocturnal lifestyle. Buckley and others has recalled in Miles Gone By: A Literary Autobiography that Meyer would sleep the day and be on the phone at night on behalf of his journalism and activism. His bright intellect and passionate presentation won him a broad following among conservative intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s, who promoted it individually and through the organization he cofounded, the American Conservative Union, and through other modern conservative institutions and thinktanks influenced by him, including The Heritage Foundation, The Fund for American Studies, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, and Young America's Foundation. Philosophy of history The most important place to begin placing Meyer in context is his article \\"Western Civilization: The Problem of Political Freedom,\\" which closed his 1996 In Defense of Freedom and Related Essays. As a thinker in what F. A. Hayek\\"Kinds of Rationalism,\\" Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1967 called the \\"critical rationalist\\" philosophical school, which is more empirical than the \\"constructivist rationalism\\" of a priori deductivism, Meyer's understanding of world history is central to his philosophy. Meyer's essential argument is explicitly based upon the philosopher Eric Voegelin's multivolume Order and History that all world history until more modern times was composed of \\"cosmological\\" societies that unified all social activity under one controlling myth subsuming society and the state into one common understanding and power monism. Meyer labeled the societies \\"tightly unified\\"In Defense, 210 in their mores, culture, economies, religion, and government by suppressing all contradictory understandings. Following Lord Acton's \\"Liberty in Ancient Times,\\" Meyer found only two historical \\"stirrings\\" in which that cosmological unity was even temporarily breached. In Athens, Socrates used his vision of the cave to discover a reality behind its cosmological reality as interpreted by its democratic authorities, which challenged them by viewing ideal forms as the real repository of truth beyond the myths of its culture. The unity was challenged so fundamentally that society turned upon the prophet, killed him, and returned to its previous unity. Abraham likewise rejected the cosmological unity of Ur and claimed a God that was independent of and more powerful than its myth, which Moses reinforced years later by rejecting Egyptian cosmological society to establish a Jerusalem whose prophets would likewise challenge state and society, with Nathan even forcing the monarch to admit evil and to repent. Still, the representatives of state power generally ignored or restricted the challengers, and in any event, a new cosmological state, Rome, ended both stirrings and established an even stronger cosmological unity. Caesar became the \\"sanctified symbol of the cosmos,\\" in Meyer's terms,In Defense, 221 and came to dominate the known world. About the same happened in China, India, Persia, the Americas, and the rest. Modern times did not break the unity until a small voice in Rome's hinterlands cried out, \\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.\\" The Incarnation, the \\"flash of eternity into time\\" as Meyer labeled it,In Defense, 219 effectively severed the unity by its concrete effects and proved even more empirically enduring in Europe than Caesar. However, it created not a new unity but a \\"tension\\"In Defense, 220‚Äì01 between empirical power and a mystical power sourced from another world but energizing this world. In Europe are \\"two sets of tensions\\" of church and state contested and later added other tensions from cities, towns and estates that culminated in a Magna Carta that demanded for no single force to unify the rest, which created the conditions for freedom under agreed upon law, rather than a single state-enforced cosmological way. The idea of dividing power to allow freedom within its tradition was only partially realized in medieval EuropeIn Defense, 222 and was later challenged fundamentally by the rise of national monarchies and parliaments, which claimed a divine or popular right and power to reconstitute itself in new cosmological or utopian forms to retrieve the sense of order and unity promised by monism. Before the tension was tamed in England, it was transferred to America, where it was protected by its colonial isolation, allowing the tension and balance of power between freedom and tradition to reach its zenith in the US Constitution.In Defense, 223‚Äì The utopian temptation to return to the cocoon of cosmological or radical unity, however, survived even in America.In Defense, 215‚Äì6 Whether reform was domestic, as from Woodrow Wilson,The Study of Administration, Washington, D.C., Public Affairs Press, 1955; originally published 1887 or more foreign influences, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Hobbes, and Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, they saw division of power and the tradition that sustained its tension as the central societal problems of modern times, with the task of reform to remove the impediments to a restored unity. To Meyer, the task of conservatism was to preserve the tension of the Western tradition to protect human freedom, which was inherently pluralist. Freedom and tradition In his most influential book, In Defense of Freedom, freedom was defined in what Isaiah Berlin would label \\"negative\\" terms as the minimization of the use of coercion by the state in its essential role of preventing one person's freedom from intruding upon another's. While left-utopianism was considered the immediate threat to the survival of this freedom, Meyer aimed at a \\"New Conservatism\\" as the principle protagonist against liberty from the right in his day. This new conservatism viewed society as an organism whose agent was the national government rather than the states or private entities.In Defense, 57 The new conservatives were less statist than the left and even rhetorically supported freedom, but it was a freedom defined as an end rather than a means,In Defense, 74 with Meyer using Clinton Rossiter's 1955 definition of positive freedom in his Conservatism in America as his major foil.In Defense, 75 Meyer argued that virtue could reside only in the individual.In Defense, 78 The state should protect freedom but otherwise leave virtue to individuals. The right of others to freedom must be respected by the individual even if the state does not respect it.In Defense, 83‚Äì84 The state has only three legitimate functions: police, military, and legal system,In Defense, 100 all necessary to control coercion, which is immoral if not restricted. There is an obligation to others but it is individual, for even the \\"Great Commandment\\" is expressed in individual form: God, neighbor and oneself are each individual.In Defense, 82 Virtue is critical for society and freedom must be balanced by responsibility but both are inherently individual in form.In Defense, 69 Forced values cannot be virtuous.In Defense, 121 The question of how to preserve moral order is important but would take \\"another book,\\"In Defense, 81 which he never wrote. Yet even when the state takes properly limited acts to protect freedom, tradition will necessarily shape every such decision.In Defense, 84‚Äì86 Freedom by itself has no goal, no intrinsic end.In Defense, 157 Freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians, who also make freedom an end rather than a means.In Defense, 79‚Äì80 A utopia of freedom is a contradiction in terms.In Defense, 87‚Äì8 In a real society, traditional order and freedom can exist together only in tension.In Defense, 98 To retain the essentiality of both freedom and tradition, the solution to the dilemma is \\"grasping it by both horns.\\"In Defense, 80 The solution is a synthesis of both, even in the face of those such as Leo StraussLeo Strauss, Natural Right and History 1953 who argue that no such synthesis is possible or even logical. Donald Devine has argued Meyer's synthesis is a first principle or axiom that is as valid as Strauss's monist first principle and relates this to Hayek's critical rationalism philosophical tradition and those he identifies with it such as Aristotle, Cicero, Thomas Aquinas, Montesquieu, John Locke, Adam Smith and Lord Acton.Donald J. Devine. America's Way Back, Wlimington, Delaware, ISI Books, 2012, Ch. 6 Traditionalist critics Meyer's attempt at synthesis was questioned by those representing both constituent parts. Traditionalists were provoked by Meyer's negative statements about two of their favorites, Robert Nisbet and Russell Kirk, which Kirk reciprocated by calling him \\"an ideologue for liberty\\".Russell Kirk, \\"An Ideologue of Liberty,\\" Sewanee Review, April‚ÄìJune 1964, 349‚Äì350 Meyer, however, did refer to both as \\"serious\\" thinkers,In Defense, 3 a Meyer footnoteIn Defense, 59 even conceded Kirk \\"in recent years\\" had been more supportive of freedom, and he called Kirk's views on freedom itself \\"excellent\\".In Defense, 125 Meyer also conceded that both Nisbet and Kirk primarily desired only local as opposed to national or even state community power \\"to their credit\\" but they could be chided even then for not understanding that the rationale for local community is that local government is more based upon freedom.In Defense, 123 The traditionalist Rossiter rather than Kirk or Nesbit was Meyer's target.In Defense, 5 Meyer even granted the New Conservatives were correct that virtue is \\"the most important of problems\\".In Defense, 127 The fundamental problem was that Rossiter insisted upon a \\"positive freedom\\" that changed freedom from a means to an end, just as did the utilitarian libertarians. Contrary to the Catholic philosopher Stanley Parry's claim that Meyer did not even recognize the family as a natural community,Stanley Parry, \\"The Faces of Freedom.\\" Modern Age, Spring 1964, 208‚Äì210 Meyer called the family and state \\"necessary associations\\".In Defense, 134 The family was different from all other institutions since children were not full individuals and thus required protection and limited rights. He argued that the state actually had been a hindrance to both virtue and the family rather than their champion. As far as educating children, prior to state control schools taught virtue and the truths of Western civilization and now do not.In Defense, 141 Fellow National Review editor Brent BozellBrent Bozell, \\"Freedom or Virtue?\\" in Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate, edited by George W. Carey, Wilmington, Delaware: ISI Books, 1998, 20‚Äì37 criticized Meyer for demanding a \\"maximum freedom\\" and for arguing that freedom is necessary in order to act virtuously. Meyer did not make either claim. He actually wrote that total freedom was impossible.In Defense, 84 He did not say that freedom was necessary for virtue but only that forced virtue is not virtuous. A forced act may be objectively virtuous in some sense but not for the individual who is forced to act. Meyer's concern was that to give the state the power to define virtue is to have no standard for virtue at all. Its definition would change with every change in power distribution. One cannot give the state the definition of virtue or there is no virtue ‚Äì there is only power. Actually, Bozell at the end recommended a social policy based upon the moral principle of subsidiarity, which is not all that different from Meyer's position. A Parry articleStanley Parry, \\"The Restoration of Tradition,\\" Modern Age, Spring 1961, 125‚Äì138 argued that the Meyer libertarian critique was correct about the state and reform did necessitate a revision of tradition once the previous vision had lost its energy. Pure restoration would be reactionary and impossible once broken. Restoration required a new \\"prophet\\" who would have to convince people freely to adopt the revision, not to rely upon force, which simply cannot be inspiring enough for substantial change. It is necessary to take what is good from the present tradition, remove what has been abused and proclaim the revision as a renewed tradition, which must specifically convince the \\"individual members of a multitude\\" in order for a true synthesis to revitalize society.In Defense, 137 In the late 1960s, Meyer engaged in a continuing debate over the status of Abraham Lincoln with Harry V. Jaffa. Jaffa faulted Meyer for blaming Lincoln for the \\"destruction of the autonomy of the states\\".In Defense, 842 Meyer argued that Lincoln's abuses of civil liberties and expansion of government power should make him anathema to conservatives, while Jaffa defended Lincoln as in the tradition of the Founding Fathers. Slavery, segregation and African American civil rights were seen as the defining case against fusionism's relevance to modern times because of the insistence by Meyer and others at the time that states rights be preserved even in the face of these demands.Jonathan Adler's \\"Frank Meyer: The Fusionist as Federalist\\" Publius, Fall 2004 Harry V. JaffaHarry V. Jaffa, \\"Lincoln and the Cause of Freedom,\\" National Review, September 21, 1965, 827‚Äì828 and 842 argued that neither state nor national sovereignty was clearly established in the Constitution but no American president has in fact operated on the assumption that state power was preeminent, giving the Constitution a nationalist orientation. Once in position to act nationally, all presidents have exercised national power. Some of the cited presidents did act in favor of states rights but mostly as state officials or former presidents than when in power, such as Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. Meyer replied that in fact the states had power and even caused a Civil War, which was more accurately labeled as a war between the states. Meyer argued that limited national power, state autonomy, and decentralism were the essence of the Constitution as far as government was concerned. Lord Acton considered federalism the unique contribution of America to the historical understanding of freedom. Certainly that force has atrophied over time and even Meyer conceded some 14th Amendment limits to state actions. But he maintained with National Review editor James BurnhamJames Burnham, Congress and the American Tradition that the Federal Courts were not supreme. Separation of powers was the essence of the Constitution, very much including the states whose checks and balances were still alive in his day in the effective if partial state nullification of national court cases and laws.Meyer, \\"The Attack on the Congress\\" in The Conservative Mainstream Libertarian critics Some libertarians vigorously joined in criticizing Meyer's conclusion that both ideological libertarianism and traditionalism were distortions of same Western tradition and that both undermined freedom.In Defense, 156 Meyer specifically censured libertarian favorites Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill for setting freedom as an end, not unlike the New Conservatives, only the ends were different. Meyer argued that utilitarian libertarians today use court power to force \\"freedom\\" ends with such vague phrases as due process and equal protection and manipulating utopian versions of freedom of the press, religion and speech.Meyer, \\"The Court Challenges the Congress,\\" \\"Confusion in the Court,\\" \\"Other-Directed Champion of Other-Directed Court,\\" \\"The Constitutional Crisis,\\" and \\"Frank v. Maryland: The Knock on the Door,\\" in The Conservative Mainstream Pure libertarians assume they know what \\"freedom\\" is and that the state should enforce their vision through the courts. Meyer argued that freedom by itself had no end, no purpose other than as a means for people to freely choose their own ends. Ronald HamowyRonald Hamowy, \\"Liberalism and Neo- Conservatism: Is a Synthesis Possible?\\" Modern Age Fall 1964, 350‚Äì359 argued Meyer's synthesis cannot hold because there was a fundamental difference between a classical liberalism that promoted markets and freedom and a traditionalist conservatism that resisted it. But that view was refuted historically by the fact that the first industrial revolution began in Clairvaux in 1115 with a more scientific agriculture and advanced water- powered machinery, beginning capitalism in a fundamentally traditional and even feudal society. Murray RothbardMurray Rothbard, \\"Conservatism and Freedom: A Libertarian Comment.\\" Modern Age, Spring 1961, 217‚Äì220 was viewed favorably by Meyer for his recognition of the importance of tradition in reasoning, especially his support for St. Thomas Aquinas and his view that Enlightenment \\"hatred\\" for the medieval Catholic Church weakened freedom.In Defense, 218 Rothbard was only criticized as too pessimistic in his view of the courts as the \\"final power\\" compared to Meyer's view that separation of powers left no one branch in charge and that each has power against the others, including the Congress and the states against the national courts.Meyer, \\"The Revolt Against Congress\\" and \\"The Attack on the Congress,\\" in The Conservative Mainstream Rothbard, in fact, argued that Meyer's fusionism was actually the natural law-natural rights branch of libertarian thought which Rothbard himself and other true libertarians followed.Murray Rothbard, \\"Frank S. Meyer: The Fusionist as Libertarian Manqu√©.\\" Modern Age, Fall 1981, 352‚Äì363 Libertarian journalist Ryan Sager in 2007's The Elephant in the Room: Evangelicals, Libertarians, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party reviewed Meyer's work favorably and called for a principled revival of Meyer's fusionism to save the embattled party following its 2006 electoral defeats. Meyer's philosophical synthesis Rothbard's argument that Meyer was simply a libertarian and not a synthesizer, someone who was somewhat confused about the nature of tradition, can be criticized in return for forcing tradition into his philosophy through the back door by calling it \\"common sense.\\" Rothbard insisted morality was already part of libertarianism as he understood it ‚Äì the \\"Aristotelian-Lockean natural rights wing,\\" as he labeled it, as opposed to the \\"utilitarian-emotivist-hedonistic wing.\\" Yet, is not the proper response to this: who is the manqu√©? Is not the popular understanding of libertarianism (the Libertarian Party, for example) precisely the precepts of the \\"hedonistic wing?\\" With common sense and natural rights (and even St. Thomas Aquinas) as part of his libertarianism, could not Rothbard just as well be labeled as a fusionist manqu√©, or simply as a fusionist, since his synthesis did not follow the predominant utilitarian/emotivist wing of libertarianism? Paul GottfriedPaul Gottfried, \\"Toward a New Fusionism? The old right makes new alliances\\" Policy Review, Fall 1987, 64‚Äì70 criticized Meyer's fusionist synthesis from the traditionalist, realist right by charging that it is impossible to say that Meyer's fusionism had worked. It rejected many elements of a comprehensive fusionism that could have created a movement that achieved great things but failed in this by purging powerful voices on the right who did not follow its party line. Meyer rested his view of freedom upon \\"Christian metaphysics\\" as did Rothbard, Gottfried argued, making Meyer's philosophy of history too \\"rough\\" to attract many of the Old Right who were more realist, secular and pragmatic. Rejected by the fusionist right these tended to see themselves as martyrs to their principles, especially excluded by the neoconservatives who controlled access to intellectual funding and prestige. Gottfried called for a new more comprehensive fusionist alliance based upon \\"similar\\" Meyer-like principles that could now include a second generation Old Right that \\"no longer extols an active government even in principle,\\" a coalition that would only exclude the nationalist, pro big government neoconservatives. Joseph BottumJoseph Bottum, \\"Social Conservatism and the New Fusionism.\\" in Varieties of Conservatism in America, edited by Peter Berkowitz. Stanford, Hoover Institute Press, 2004, 31‚Äì47 \\"cannot see how to put the cracked egg of conservatism back together. There seems no place in America these days for Frank Meyer fusionism, or even Ronald Reagan's big-tent Republicanism.\\" Gottfried's paleocons reject \\"True Man\\" as understood by St. Augustine and most libertarians reject religion, which is the life of the Western state, Bottum argued, and both libertarians and traditionalists elements of the Meyer fusion today tend to dismiss the need for an aggressive foreign policy. Bottum instead offered a new \\"tension\\" between religion and the Enlightenment, a new fusionism of religious traditionalists and secular \\"foreign policy neoconservatives\\" as they have been gathered at The Weekly Standard magazine, where he was an editor. He was sensitive that this might be viewed as a \\"fairly cynical bargain\\" manipulated by the neoconservatives but insisted it resulted from \\"mutual persuasion\\" in debate with the social conservatives. The nature of the agreement is unclear except in a presumed joint opposition to abortion. Yet, even Bottom conceded that when the religious faction questioned the legitimacy of the Court in its failure to end abortion, the neoconservatives attacked it ruthlessly for questioning the government's legitimacy. While Bottum argued the coalition survived the controversy, it is unclear whether the two can manage the legitimacy question since it is primary for the neoconservatives and only at best secondary for the religious traditionalists. It was the classical liberal F. A. Hayek in \\"Freedom, Reason and Tradition\\"F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1978, 54‚Äì70 who most systematically and relentlessly pursued the nature of a libertarian/traditionalist synthesis but was loath to give it a label. He began by distinguishing between two views of human reason, a speculative/rationalistic/utopian and an empirical/evolutionary/institutional one, which was \\"particularly conspicuous\\" in their different assumptions about human nature.Hayek, 60 The former viewed intelligence and goodness as natural to individual man while the latter argued that institutions must be created so that \\"bad people could do least harm.\\" While not arguing for this on religious grounds, he acknowledged his empirical position was \\"closer to the Christian tradition of the fallibility and sinfulness of man, while the perfectionism of the rationalist is in irreconcilable conflict with it\\".Hayek, 61 To Hayek, like Meyer, freedom and tradition were fused. \\"Paradoxical as it may appear, it is probably true that a successful free society will always in large measure be a tradition-bound society,\\" for a free society needs customs, laws and institutions whose observance is a \\"necessary condition\\" for freedom.Hayek, 61‚Äì2 Freedom is the means but the \\"values into which we are born supplies the ends which our reason must serve\\".Hayek, 63 This fusion was believed essential not only to social life but to thought, science and to reason itself. Without that dualism, there would have been no historical freedom.Hayek, 69 It was not a coincidence that Hayek was the one who first led Meyer to arrive at his mature philosophy. Ronald Reagan influence As Ronald Reagan assumed the pinnacle of power of the presidency in 1981, in his first speech to an audience of his conservative allies in Washington, he reminded them of their roots. After listing \\"intellectual leaders like Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James Burnham, [and] Ludwig von Mises\\" as the ones who \\"shaped so much of our thoughts,\\" he discussed only one of these influences at length. \\"It's especially hard to believe that it was only a decade ago, on a cold April day on a small hill in upstate New York, that another of these great thinkers, Frank Meyer, was buried. He'd made the awful journey that so many others had: He pulled himself from the clutches of The [communist] God That Failed, and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought ‚Äì a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.\\" As he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles motivating this new conservative movement. \\"It was Frank Meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the American experience was part of the deeper current of Western learning and culture. He pointed out that a respect for law, an appreciation for tradition, and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions, these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace. Our goals complement each other. We're not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management. This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities, only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government.\\" \\"We can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly. Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government, we can be very clear: We do not have a separate social agenda, separate economic agenda, and a separate foreign agenda. We have one agenda. Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nation's defenses, so too we seek to protect the unborn, to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners, and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions.\\"Ronald Reagan, \\"Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference,\\" March 20, 1981, The essence of this fusionist synthesis was \\"cutting the size and scope\\" of the national government and \\"returning power to the states and communities\\" to allow the traditional \\"social consensus,\\" its \\"robust individualism,\\" and the free market to restore prosperity and civic vitality. Ronald Reagan took Meyer's idea of this Western synthesis into government and could claim some success in translating it into power, at least for a while. Its future, however, must be viewed as more problematical.

The album was recorded by guitarist Efrim Menuck and bassist Thierry Amar at the Hotel2Tango in 1999, mostly during breaks while touring with Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It was published by the Montreal-based record label Constellation on March 27, 2000. The album was born out of a desire by Efrim Menuck to record something for his dog Wanda, who died of cancer while Godspeed You! Black Emperor were on tour. Menuck described the recording of the album as a \\"Jewish experience\\", due to his immersion within a small, friend-based Jewish community in Montreal.

There is some Jewish imagery in the lyrics to the track \\"Movie (Never Made)\\",The band's lyrics source: but their exact meaning remains cryptic. The album was initially to be named He Has Left Us Alone, but it was decided that this was too weak, and didn't convey the proper mood.

Instead, Menuck believes that things of that nature can be described with many words, giving sensibility and a \\"frame\\" to the work.

Early life Parks was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Aaron Jacobson, a Jewish merchant who had immigrated to the United States in 1900 from Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire), and his wife Hattie (Spiegel) Jacobson, the daughter of immigrants from Austria-Hungary.US Census 1930, Atlanta, GA, Supervisor's District 4, Sheer 24A. He had one older brother, Allen Jacobson. Parks' had his first experience in amateur theatre when he was four years old. He graduated from Marist College, a Catholic preparatory school in Atlanta. Radio Parks entered radio broadcasting at age 16, for Atlanta's WGST.DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 210. Three years later, he moved to New York City and was hired as a singer and straight man on The Eddie Cantor Show, then becoming a CBS Radio staff announcer. Parks was the host of Break the Bank, which premiered on radio in 1945 and was telecast from 1948 to 1957, as well as Stop the Music on radio in 1948 and television from 1949 to 1952. The success of Stop the Music took a toll on the ratings of the popular radio show hosted by satirist Fred Allen, who began spoofing Parks's program with skits mocking the premise of the show, one called Cease The Melody. With other celebrities, he hosted NBC radio's Monitor during the 1960s. Television A statue of Bert Parks in Atlantic City commemorates his association with the Miss America pageant. Parks' first game show was Party Line on NBC (broadcast from New York City NBC flagship station WNBT), which involved viewers calling in to answer questions and win $5 prizes; Party Line ran from June 8 to August 31, 1947, making its one surviving episode the oldest known game show and one of the oldest surviving television shows to have been recorded. Commercial kinescopes did not come out until fall 1947 (co-sponsored by NBC, DuMont, and Kodak), and the only kinescopes known to predate Party Line are a few episodes of Kraft Television Theater from February and June 1947.Library of Congress online archives Other games that Parks hosted in early television include Stop the Music (1949-52/1954-56), Double or Nothing (1952‚Äì54), Balance Your Budget (1952‚Äì53), Two in Love (1954), Giant Step (1956‚Äì57), Hold That Note (1957), Bid 'n' Buy (1958), County Fair (1958‚Äì59), Masquerade Party (1958‚Äì60), The Big Payoff (1959), Yours for a Song (1961‚Äì63), and the pilot for Hollywood Squares (April 21, 1965). His last game show hosting job was in 1968, on the pilot for a revival of Heatter-Quigley's The Celebrity Game; the show did not sell. He also helmed a daytime variety show in 1950, simply called The Bert Parks Show. In addition, he also starred in a syndicated series called Circus! (featuring various circus acts from around the world) in the early 1970s. Parks also appeared in a 1976 episode of The Bionic Woman as the nefarious host of the \\"Miss United States\\" beauty pageant, involved in a plot to sell national security technology. However, Parks is most famous for hosting the Miss America telecast from 1955‚Äì79; each telecast ended with Parks singing \\"There She Is, Miss America\\", as the winner was crowned (in the aforementioned Bionic Woman episode, he sings a parody of the song for the episode's fictional pageant). Following the 1979 pageant, he was unceremoniously fired by the organization (he heard a newscast while on vacation) in an attempt to attract a more youthful audience. The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson led an on-air campaign to get Parks rehired, but was unsuccessful. In 1990, for the 70th anniversary of the Miss America pageant (during which Miss America 1991 was crowned), Parks was brought on by host Gary Collins to sing \\"There She Is\\" to the new Miss America, Marjorie Judith Vincent. It was the last time Parks performed the song live. Parks' last known television appearance, a Pepsi commercial, first aired in June 1991. Recordings A recording of \\"There She Is, Miss America\\" as sung by Parks was used each year in the Miss America scholarship pageant until 2012 as the new reigning titleholder takes her walk down the runway in her newly earned crown. On September 13, 2015, the recording was reused for the 95th Anniversary of the Miss America pageant. Parks did a take-off of his hosting role in The Freshman (1990), starring Marlon Brando, Matthew Broderick and Bruno Kirby. He played the emcee of a Gourmet Club dinner where guests supposedly eat a Komodo dragon, singing a spoof of \\"There She Is\\" in a salute to the soon-to-be-deceased dragon. Some of his other film appearances were in That's the Way of the World (1975) and The Great Balloon Race (1977). Parks appeared on WKRP in Cincinnati in the 1980 episode \\"Herb's Dad\\", playing Herb Tarlek Sr. (father of series' regular Herb Tarlek Jr.). In 1988, Parks appeared on an episode of 227 as himself, and in 1991, Parks appeared on an episode of Night Court as himself. Death Parks died of lung cancer at La Jolla, California on February 2, 1992 at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Annette (Liebman) Parks (June 28, 1921 - December 19, 2013), and their three children.

He designed the I-15 series of fighters, and the I-16 Ishak ( phonetically close to its or designation) \\"Little Donkey\\" fighter. Biography Polikarpov was born in the village of Georgievskoye near Livny in Oryol Governorate. He was the son of a village priest in the Russian Orthodox Church. He initially also trained for the priesthood and studied at the Oryol Seminary before moving to Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University in 1911, where he became fascinated with the fledgling aviation work being carried out under the shipbuilding department. Polikarpov graduated in 1916 and went to work for Igor Sikorski, the head of production at the Russian Baltic Carriage Factory. While working for Sikorski, Polikarpov helped design the massive Ilya Muromets four-engine bomber for the Imperial Russian Air Force.  Soviet career  Polikarpov stayed in Russia after the Russian Revolution and rose to become head of the technical department Dux Aircraft factory in 1923. Polikarpov was responsible for some of the first indigenous aircraft designs in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, including the I-1 fighter (1923), R-1 reconnaissance plane (1927), U-2 utility biplane (1927‚Äì1928), I-3 fighter (1928), R-5 reconnaissance bomber (1928). Notably, the U-2, Russian nickname Kukuruznik, loosely translated: crop-duster, (post 1944 designation Po-2), remained in mainstream production until 1952 and over 30,000 examples were produced. In 1928, under provisions of the Five-Year Plan for experimental aircraft design, Polikarpov was assigned to develop the primarily wooden I-6 fighter for delivery by mid-1930. The plan was unrealistic and failed. As such, in October 1929, Polikarpov and around other 450 aircraft designers and engineers were arrested on fabricated charges of sabotage and counter-revolutionary activities, after which he was sentenced to death. In December, after two months of waiting for execution, he was transferred to a Special Design Bureau of OGPU set at Butyrka prison and had the sentence changed to 10 years of forced labor. Polikarpov and the others were moved to Central Design Bureau 39 (TsKB-39) to complete the I-5 project. After a successful demonstration of the new design, the sentence was changed to a conditional one, and in July 1931 he was granted amnesty together with a group of other convicts. It was not until de-Stalinization in 1956 that the criminal charges were officially dropped posthumously. After the release he initially worked with Pavel Sukhoi since 1931, developing the I-16 in 1933 and I-15 in 1934. Then he worked under Ilyushin in 1937. In 1938, he established an independent design bureau. In 1939, he completed work on the I-153. In 1939, he was ordered to make a trip to Nazi Germany. In his absence, his plant director and chief engineer, along with design engineer Mikhail Gurevich put forth a proposal for a new fighter, the I-200, and received approval to create a new Design Bureau under the leadership of Artem Mikoyan, whose brother Anastas Mikoyan was a senior politician under Joseph Stalin. On his return, Polikarpov found that his Bureau no longer existed, with his engineers at the new MiG bureau. Nine years after his death, in 1953, his plant was given over to the Sukhoi bureau. Polikarpov was subsequently appointed professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute in 1943. He died on 30 July 1944Associated Press, ‚ÄúAviation Expert Dies‚Äù, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 1 August 1944, Volume 50, page 2. from stomach cancer. He is buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Polikarpov was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Stalin Prize (1941, 1943) and Hero of Socialist Labor (1940).

It is classified under the ECO codes A60‚ÄìA79. After the initial moves, Black proceeds to capture on d5, creating a majority of black pawns on the queenside. To support their advance, the king's bishop is usually fianchettoed on g7. These two features differentiate Black's setup from the other Benoni defences and the King's Indian Defence, although transpositions between these openings are common. Frank Marshall invented the Modern Benoni in 1927, but his experiments with the opening went largely ignored for over 20 years. In the 1950s the system was revitalized by players in the Soviet Union, chief among them Mikhail Tal. Its subsequent adoption by players of a similarly aggressive and uncompromising style such as Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov established the opening's reputation as one of Black's most dynamic responses to 1.d4. The Modern Benoni suffered a serious theoretical crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, when players as Black encountered great difficulties in meeting the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line. Only in the 21st century has the opening's reputation and theoretical standing made a recovery. Notably, it was Vladimir Kramnik's choice when he needed a win with Black in the penultimate game of the 2004 World Championship, though that particular game resulted in a draw. Initial moves The standard move order for Black to enter the Modern Benoni is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5. Here it is possible for White to avoid 3.d5: respectable alternatives include 3.Nf3, typically transposing to a line of the English Opening, as well as 3.e3. Taking the pawn with 3.dxc5 is hardly ever seen, because Black easily recovers it after 3...e6 followed by ...Bxc5. Still, 3.d5 has long been considered White's most challenging move, as it gains space in the centre. While it is possible for Black to avoid ...e7-e6 for the time being and play other moves such as 3...d6 or 3...g6, delaying this move until after White plays e2-e4 gives White the extra option of recapturing on d5 with the e-pawn. While recapturing in this fashion does not give White a central pawn majority, it maintains White's spatial advantage and denies Black the counterplay associated with possession of a queenside pawn majority. Thus players who are seeking the typical imbalance in pawn structure associated with the Modern Benoni tend to prefer the immediate 3...e6 followed by 4...exd5. Alternative move orders and transpositions It is possible, indeed common, for Black's second and third moves to be reversed: thus 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 and 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 will both transpose into the Modern Benoni if White allows it with 4.d5. The latter move order has been especially popular since the 1980s, as it allows Black to reach the Modern Benoni while sidestepping the Taimanov Attack. It also gives Black the additional option of meeting 4.d5 with 4...b5, the Blumenfeld Gambit. Players who use this move order will often choose a different defence against 3.Nc3, such as the Nimzo-Indian with 3...Bb4. Another frequent transposition into the Modern Benoni occurs when White invites a Catalan Opening with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 and Black responds with 3...c5. If White responds with 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5, Black can play 5...d6, which often transposes into the Fianchetto Variation; but a common alternative is 5...b5, which leads to independent positions. Black can also try to reach the Modern Benoni through a Benoni Defence move order, i.e. 1.d4 c5 2.d5 Nf6, when 3.c4 e6 would complete the transposition. However, White often prefers not to play 3.c4, since it takes away a useful square from a white knight. Several lines of the King's Indian Defence, such as the Four Pawns Attack, the S√§misch Variation and the Fianchetto Variation, can also transpose into variations of the Modern Benoni if Black plays ...c5 followed by ...e6 and ...exd5 and White recaptures with the c-pawn. History Frank James Marshall, inventor of the Modern Benoni Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Tal, two pioneers of the Modern Benoni Vugar Gashimov, a leading practitioner of the Modern Benoni The Modern Benoni was invented by Frank Marshall at the New York 1927 chess tournament. He played it twice, gaining a draw against Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca in the Fianchetto Variation, but losing soundly to Aron Nimzowitsch, who played the Knight's Tour. Nimzowitsch received the third special prize of the tournament for this game and labelled Marshall's opening an \\"unfortunate\\" \\"extravagance\\" in his annotations; as a result, it lay virtually abandoned for decades. However, Karel Hrom√°dka's experiments with the Benoni Defence in the 1930s occasionally featured the moves ...e7-e6 and ...exd5, resulting in a transposition to the Modern Benoni. Only in the 1950s was interest in the system revived, when the King's Indian Defence gained in popularity among Soviet players and their investigations branched into related opening systems such as the Modern Benoni. The imbalance inherent in its pawn structure and the counter-chances this implied for Black appealed to aggressive players such as Rashid Nezhmetdinov and Alexander Tolush; the Israeli master Moshe Czerniak also employed it frequently. Lev Polugaevsky, Boris Spassky and Alexey Suetin were among the younger generation of Soviet players who used it regularly in the 1950s and 1960s. But the player primarily responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni to the status of a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year. He also became the first player to use the Modern Benoni in a world championship match, playing it twice against Mikhail Botvinnik in 1960. Former World Champion and opening authority Max Euwe acknowledged Tal's contribution to the opening by naming it the \\"Tal-System\\" in his 1965 opening encyclopedia. These developments did not go unnoticed outside the Soviet Union: the name \\"Modern Benoni\\" had appeared in print by 1955. In the 1960s Larry Evans began employing the system frequently, and from 1966 onwards, Bobby Fischer also included it in his repertoire, albeit as a secondary weapon. Even so, Fischer was responsible for one of the most famous games ever played with the opening: down 2‚Äì0 in the 1972 World Championship match, he answered Spassky's 1.d4 with the Modern Benoni in Game 3 and scored a momentum-changing victory. The successes of Tal and Fischer inspired a new generation of players to take up the Modern Benoni in the 1970s and 1980s, including Walter Browne, Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá, John Nunn, Dragoljub Velimiroviƒá, Lev Psakhis, Mihai Suba and Nick de Firmian. The young Garry Kasparov also had the defence in his arsenal‚Äîhis win against Viktor Korchnoi at the 1982 Lucerne Olympiad was considered the highlight of the tournament and remains one of the most famous games ever played in the opening. It became a favoured weapon for players needing to win against 1.d4: for example, Psakhis used it to defeat Yuri Razuvaev in the penultimate round of the 1980 USSR Championship, catching Alexander Beliavsky in the lead and ultimately sharing first place with him. But in the early 1980s, White scored several crushing victories at high-profile tournaments using the aggressive Taimanov Attack, which caused players to question the fundamental soundness of Black's opening. By the end of the decade, the Modern Main Line had also emerged as a dangerous weapon for White, which only compounded Black's troubles. As a result, the opening declined in popularity and a number of grandmasters gave it up altogether. Those who continued to play it often chose to do so via the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5, when White's early development of the knight to f3 rules out the Taimanov Attack and gives Black opportunities to avoid the Modern Main Line. Mired in this theoretical crisis, the Modern Benoni remained unpopular in the 1990s. Veselin Topalov was the only top-level player to play it regularly, and he too generally preferred the 2...e6 3.Nf3 c5 move order. At the beginning of the new millennium, the theoretician John Watson published a well-regarded survey of the opening that may have contributed to the opening's revival. Many of the ideas he recommended, such as 9...Qh4+ versus the Taimanov Attack and 9...Nh5 in the Modern Main Line, grew in popularity after its publication. The opening regained some more of its former respectability when Vladimir Kramnik, needing a win with Black against Peter Leko, played it in the second to last game of the 2004 World Championship. While he did achieve a winning position at one point, the game ended in a draw. Nevertheless, √âtienne Bacrot, Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk have all since used the Modern Benoni at the highest levels of competition, while Vugar Gashimov became the opening's most notable proponent. He was the strongest player willing to use the original 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 move order and defend Black's cause in both the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line. Strategy The Modern Benoni is one of Black's sharpest and most active defences against 1.d4. The exchange of White's c-pawn for Black's e-pawn leaves White with a pawn majority in the centre and Black with one on the queenside. This asymmetry suggests that White will try to play on the kingside and in the centre, while Black will seek counterplay on the queenside. However, this simplistic generalization does not hold in many cases‚Äîdepending on how the pieces are arranged, either side may be able to fight back on the flank where they are theoretically weaker. The creation of such a pronounced structural imbalance so early on in the game implies that Black aims to counterattack rather than equalize. Thus the opening has acquired a reputation for being risky: as Psakhis once wrote, the Modern Benoni \\"is definitely not an opening for cowards.\\" Since White's central superiority typically constitutes a positional advantage, Black must frequently resort to tactical play and material sacrifices in order not to be forced into passivity. Black's queenside play The game Donner‚ÄìTal, Zurich 1959, was a classic demonstration of the power of Black's queenside pawn advance, backed up by the bishop on g7. After Black's 20...Qb4! White was unable to exchange queens, as 21.Qxb4 cxb4 22.Nd1 Nc5 would fork the pawns on a4 and e4. However, the actual game did not last long after Donner's 21.Qf1: Tal set his pawns in motion with 21...c4 22.Re2 b5 23.axb5 axb5 24.Kh1, created a passed c-pawn with 24...Bxc3! 25.bxc3 Qxc3 26.Rxb5 Qd3 27.Qe1 c3 28.Rb1, and forced Donner's resignation with 28...Nc5! when White could neither save his e-pawn nor stop Black's c-pawn from queening. According to Donner, while he spent over two hours on the game, Tal used only fifteen minutes. White's kingside play The central pawn majority is White's main positional trump in the Modern Benoni. By staking out an advantage in space on the kingside, it allows White to develop an initiative on that side of the board. The most important tool in White's arsenal is the e4-e5 pawn advance, which can open up lines and squares for the white pieces, and result in the creation of a passed d-pawn if Black answers with ...dxe5. A famous example of the e4-e5 break leading to a kingside attack occurred in the game Penrose‚ÄìTal from the 1960 Leipzig Olympiad. With 19.e5! dxe5 20.f5! Bb7 21.Rad1 Ba8 22.Nce4 White installed a powerful knight on e4, while Black's pieces were hemmed in by the pawn on e5. Penrose soon crashed through on the f-file and scored a stunning upset over the reigning world champion. Other classic examples of this central breakthrough include Ojanen‚ÄìKeres, Estonia‚ÄìFinland match, Helsinki 1960 and Korchnoi‚ÄìTal, USSR championship, Yerevan 1962. Black's kingside play The half-open e-file gives Black a certain degree of influence over the kingside. A rook on e8 puts pressure on White's e-pawn and restrains it from advancing. Tactics involving ...Nxe4 are not uncommon‚Äîthe games Averbakh‚ÄìTal, USSR championship, Riga 1958, and Uhlmann‚ÄìFischer, Interzonal, Palma de Mallorca 1970, are well-known examples. Black can initiate further kingside activity by playing ...Nd7-e5 followed by ...g7-g5. The pawn move prevents White from driving away the knight with f2-f4, and sets up the possibility of Black bringing a knight on f4 via g6 or h5. Further space-gaining pawn advances such as ...g5-g4 and ...f7-f5 may even be possible. En route to winning his first USSR championship, Tal provided a brilliant example of how Black's dark-square control could lead to a kingside attack. Against Gurgenidze at the 1957 championship in Moscow, he unleashed the double sacrifice 14...Nxf2!! 15.Kxf2 Qh4+ 16.Kf1 (16.g3? Bd4+ 17.Kg2 Qxh3+ 18.Kf3 Bg4+ 19.Kf4 g5+ 20.Kxg5 Be3+ 21.Kf6 Qh6 mate) Bd4 17.Nd1 Qxh3! with the point that 18.gxh3 Bxh3 is mate. After 18.Bf3 Qh2 19.Ne3 f5! 20.Ndc4 fxe4 21.Bxe4 Ba6! White was unable to defend against Black's threats of 22...Rxe4 23.Qxe4 Re8 24.Qc2 Nxd5 and 22...Bxc4+ 23.Nxc4 Rf8+ 24. Bf3 Rxf3+, and Gurgenidze resigned after move 27. White's queenside play When Black prepares the ...b7-b5 pawn break with ...a6, White usually tries to hinder it by playing a2-a4, even though this advance weakens the b4-square. As a further deterrent to Black's queenside expansion, White often moves the knight on f3 to c4 via d2. With the knight on c4, Black's ...b7-b5 break may be met by axb5 followed by Na5, when the arrival of a white knight on c6 could severely disrupt Black's position. The knight on c4 also attacks Black's backward pawn on d6, and White can often increase the pressure on this pawn by playing Bf4 or Nb5. The strength of White's knight on c4 often induces Black to exchange it off: typical ways of doing so are ...Nb6, ...Ne5, or ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6. Even if Black should succeed in enforcing the ...b7-b5 break, White may halt the b-pawn's further advance by simply playing b2-b4. Even though this would give Black the opportunity to establish a passed c-pawn with ...c5-c4, blockading the queenside in this manner may allow White to pursue play in the centre and on the kingside undisturbed. The ...c5-c4 advance would also relinquish Black's control over the d4-square, which may be occupied to good effect by a white knight or bishop. A successful demonstration of this last idea occurred in the game Pint√©r‚ÄìBrynell at the 1998 Elista Olympiad. White answered Black's 21...b5 with 22.b4!, and Black was unable to keep the queenside open with 22...bxa4? because 23.bxc5 Rxb1 24.Rxb1 dxc5 25.Bxc5 would have left White's central pawns unstoppable. After the game's 22...c4 23.a5! Qe7 24.Bd4 Black's queenside play had ground to a halt; Pint√©r later won with a pawn advance on the kingside. Variations After the initial moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6, the moves 4.Nf3 and 4.g3 reach positions discussed previously, while 4.dxe6 fxe6 is also ineffective, since Black gains a half- open f-file and the chance to take over the centre with ...d7-d5. Instead White's most popular move is 4.Nc3, preparing to support the d-pawn with 5.e4. As mentioned above, were Black to delay the capture on d5, White would then gain the option of recapturing with the e-pawn. Thus Black generally plays 4...exd5 immediately. Following the recapture 5.cxd5, Black has an eccentric option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's control over the central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must decide whether or not to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first. 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 The most critical lines in the Modern Benoni occur after 6.e4 g6. At this point 7.Nf3 has historically been White's most popular move, intending to complete kingside development and castle. Here theory divides into three major branches: *7...Bg7 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0, the Classical Main Line; *7...Bg7 8.h3 0-0 9.Bd3, the Modern Main Line; *and 7...a6, an attempt by Black to avoid the Modern Main Line. Apart from 7.Nf3, White also has several important alternatives, including: * 7.f4, which leads to the Taimanov Attack, Four Pawns Attack, or Mikenas Attack; * 7.Bd3, which often leads to the Knaak Variation but may also transpose to the Modern Main Line; * 7.h3, which is yet another way for White to reach the Modern Main Line after 7...Bg7 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Bd3; * 7.f3, the Kapengut Variation; * and 7.Nge2, which was recommended for White in 2012 by Lars Schandorff. The idea is to develop with Ng3, Be2 and 0-0. =7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0: Classical Main Line = Before the advent of the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line, the sequence 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0 was the most frequently contested line in the Modern Benoni. Here Black has a choice between three main plans. Two of them begin with 9...Re8, attacking the e-pawn. After 10.Nd2, Black's most dynamic plan is to prepare kingside play with 10...Nbd7 followed by ...Ne5 and ...g6-g5. This plan became popular in the 1970s after Fischer used it, and although it is riskier than the alternatives, it remains Black's best option to complicate the game. Alternatively, Black can try the older move 10...Na6, intending to bring the knight to c7 to prepare the ...b7-b5 break. White most commonly responds with Gligoriƒá's 11.f3 Nc7 12.a4, which clamps down on b5 and overprotects e4 so that White can follow up with Nc4. Black's position remains solid but offers fewer active possibilities than after 10...Nbd7. At the 1973 Madrid international tournament Ljubojeviƒá demonstrated what is now considered to be Black's most reliable path to equality. Against Silvino Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez he played 9...a6 10.a4 Bg4 11.Bf4 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 and now the innovation 12...Qe7! which prepares ...Nbd7 while keeping the pawn on d6 defended. The exchange of Black's bishop for White's knight eases Black's slightly cramped position and weakens the force of White's e4-e5 break. =7.Nf3 Bg7 8.h3 0-0 9.Bd3: Modern Main Line= By the late 1980s Ljubojeviƒá's plan of exchanging the light- squared bishop had been proven so reliable it was deterring White from entering the Classical Main Line altogether. The desire to prevent ...Bg4 led to the development of the Modern Main Line, 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.h3 0-0 9.Bd3. If Black continues in the same manner as in the Classical Main Line, e.g. 9...a6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.0-0 Re8, then White appears to maintain an advantage with 12.Bf4. Originally it was thought that the temporary pawn sacrifice 9...b5 was an easy equalizer: after 10.Nxb5 Nxe4?! 11.Bxe4 Re8 Black seemingly regains the sacrificed piece without trouble. But in Alburt‚Äìde Firmian, USA ch 1990, White uncorked 12.Ng5! and went on to win: this move was judged the most important theoretical novelty in Volume 50 of Chess Informant. Only later was it discovered that the immediate 10...Re8 is a better way of recovering the pawn, with a complicated game in the offing. The other capture 10.Bxb5 has been subjected to extensive analysis and testing, which has led to the conclusion that the sequence 10...Nxe4 11.Nxe4 Qa5+ 12.Nfd2 Qxb5 13.Nxd6 Qa6 14.N2c4 Nd7 15.0-0 is more or less forced. In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must know a lot of theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move. Thus Black has sought other methods of combating the Modern Main Line. The sharp variation 9...Re8 10.0-0 c4 received significant attention in the mid-1990s, but after 11.Bxc4 Nxe4 12.Nxe4 Rxe4 13.Bg5 Black has yet to demonstrate clear equality. In 2001 John Watson published a detailed analysis of 9...Nh5, which stops White from playing Bc1-f4 and allows Black to follow up with ...Nd7-e5. While it is also unclear whether this move ultimately equalizes, at least Black retains significant counterplay. =7.Nf3 a6: Black avoids the Modern Main Line= White's success with the Modern Main Line has spurred Black to search for ways to get in ...Bg4 before White stops it with h2-h3. After 7.Nf3, the immediate 7...Bg4? runs into 8.Qa4+!, when 8...Bd7 9.Qb3 or 8...Nbd7? 9.Nd2! threatening 10.f3 both give White the advantage. So Black first plays 7...a6 threatening 8...b5. Only after 8.a4 does Black play 8...Bg4, when a transposition to the Classical Main Line is likely: 9.Be2 Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Bg7 11.0-0 0-0 12.Bf4 Qe7 is Ljubojeviƒá's line, for example. Instead White may try to exploit Black's early ...Bg4 with 9.Qb3, but after 9...Bxf3 10.Qxb7 Black can either maintain material and positional equality with 10...Bxg2 or try for more with 10...Nbd7!?. To cut across Black's idea of ...Bg4, White has even resorted to 8.h3 allowing 8...b5, but after 9.Bd3 Bg7 10.0-0 0-0 Black obtains an acceptable position. If White has entered the Benoni through the standard move order (4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6), White can dodge such sidelines by avoiding the immediate 7.Nf3 and starting with 7.Bd3 or 7.h3 instead: the latter two moves leave Black little choice but to enter the Modern Main Line after 7...Bg7 and 8...0-0. =7.f4: Taimanov Attack and other lines= With 7.f4 White stakes out even more space in the centre and threatens to overrun Black's position with a quick e4-e5. After 7...Bg7 White can transpose to the main line of the Four Pawns Attack in the King's Indian Defence with 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Be2. A rarer option is 8.e5, the Mikenas Attack, against which Black can equalize with either 8...Nfd7 or the rarer 8...dxe5 9.fxe5 Nfd7. By far the most popular continuation for White is 8.Bb5+, the Taimanov Attack. Analyzed by Mark Taimanov in 1956, the strength of this variation was not fully appreciated until the early 1980s. The point of the check is that both 8...Bd7 and 8...Nbd7 allow 9.e5 with advantage to White, since the knight on f6 can no longer retreat to d7. After the strongest move 8...Nfd7 the most popular move used to be 9.Bd3, preparing to meet 9...a6 with 10.a4. But in two crushing and high-profile victories with White (against Frans Andre Cuijpers at the 1980 World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, and against Nunn at the 1982 Olympiad in Lucerne) Kasparov showed that 9.a4 was more dangerous for Black, it having the advantage of not determining the bishop's retreat square for the time being. White's success with this idea led some to question the soundness of the Modern Benoni, at least in its original move order. In 1982, Nunn concluded his analysis of the Taimanov with the words, \\"Black badly needs a new idea against 8.Bb5+ and 9.a4 to keep the Benoni in business\\"; two years later, he had given up the opening altogether. Other players such as Psakhis resorted to using the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6, only playing 3...c5 in response to 3.Nf3 to avoid the Taimanov, while choosing an entirely different opening against 3.Nc3. The damage this variation did to the opening's reputation led David Norwood to rechristen it the \\"Flick-Knife Attack.\\" Not until the 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson showed that the disruptive check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is no longer able to bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4. =7.Bd3: Knaak Variation= The move 7.Bd3 is sometimes used by White to enter the Modern Main Line after 7...Bg7 8.h3 without allowing Black's attempts to play an early ...Bg4. It is also the prelude to a variation championed by Rainer Knaak, 7...Bg7 8.Nge2 0-0 9.0-0. White's plan is to play for a kingside attack beginning with the moves Ng3, f2-f4, and then either e4-e5 or f4-f5. A famous demonstration of White's kingside attack was the game Penrose‚ÄìTal, Leipzig ol 1960. However, the development of the knight to e2 rules out the Nf3-d2-c4 manoeuvre, so Black is able to get quick counterplay on the queenside with ideas like ...c5-c4 followed by ...Nd7-c5. =7.f3: Kapengut Variation= In 1996 Albert Kapengut published a dense analysis of the move 7.f3, which now bears his name. Kapengut himself gave it the name \\"Half-S√§misch Variation\\", because the positions it leads to are often reached via transposition from the S√§misch Variation of the King's Indian Defence. The pawn on f3 overprotects e4 and prevents ...Ng4, so that White can continue 7...Bg7 8.Bg5 and retreat the bishop to e3 after ...h7-h6 without it being further harassed by Black's knight. Notable past practitioners of this line have included Viktor Korchnoi and Murray Chandler. 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nf3 g6 This position arises particularly frequently through the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6. At this point White can still transpose to the Classical or Modern Main Lines after 7.e4. Other common alternatives are: *7.g3, the Fianchetto Variation; *7.Nd2, the Knight's Tour Variation; *7.Bf4; *7.Bg5, the Uhlmann Variation; *and 7.h3, which is yet another attempt for White to enter the Modern Main Line without allowing an early ...Bg4. But in this move order Black can also prevent the transposition with 7...a6 (the immediate 7...Qe7? 8.e4 Nxe4?? loses the knight to 9.Qa4+) 8.a4 Qe7, which stops White from playing e2-e4. =7.g3: Fianchetto Variation= The Fianchetto Variation has never been considered particularly dangerous for Black to meet, since White's setup does not put Black's position under immediate pressure. However, it also offers Black no obvious target to attack‚Äîthe fianchettoed bishop covers e4 and d5 and also protects White's king. Since the same bishop no longer covers the a6-f1 diagonal, White typically plays Nf3-d2-c4 to help defend against Black's queenside expansion. After further preparatory moves such as Bf4 and Re1, White may be able to push forward in the centre with e2-e4-e5. Noted proponents of the Fianchetto Variation have included strong positional players such as Viktor Korchnoi, Gennadi Sosonko and Predrag Nikoliƒá, and after a recommendation by the influential theorist Boris Avrukh in 2010, the line has become more topical. Play typically proceeds 7.g3 Bg7 8.Bg2 0-0 9.0-0, and now the most common continuation sees Black developing in standard Benoni fashion while White manoeuvres the king's knight to c4, i.e. 9...a6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.Nd2 Re8 12.h3 Rb8 13.Nc4. Here Black can challenge White's knight with either 13...Ne5 or 13...Nb6. White may also try to develop more quickly with 11.Bf4 in order to strengthen the threat of e2-e4-e5. The idea of an early Bf4 is also effective in other variations such as 9...Re8 10.Bf4. Black too can deviate: for example, the idea of playing for ...b7-b5 after 9...Na6 10.Nd2 Nc7 is frequently seen. The Fianchetto Variation is often reached via transposition from other openings. For instance, the position in the diagram can be reached from the King's Indian via 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 c5 5.d5 d6 6.Nc3 0-0 7.Nf3 e6 8.0-0 exd5 9.cxd5, or from the Catalan via 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Bg2 Bg7 8.Nf3 0-0 9.0-0. =7.Nd2: Knight's Tour Variation= The Knight's Tour Variation 7.Nd2 immediately sends the knight towards c4, where it attacks the d-pawn; the pressure on it can be increased with moves like Bf4. Black can counter this plan with 7...Nbd7 intending 8.Nc4 Nb6, while 8.e4 Bg7 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 would lead to a major variation of the Classical Main Line after 10...Re8, with White having avoided Ljubojeviƒá's plan of ...Bg4. Black is not obliged to allow this transposition though: 7...Bg7 is also playable. After 8.e4 0-0 9.Be2, Black has alternatives to 9...Re8, such as the 9...Na6 10.0-0 Ne8 Kramnik played against Leko at the 2004 World Championship, where Black intends to attack White's centre with ...f5. Alternatively, if White immediately completes the knight manoeuvre and attacks the pawn on d6 with 8.Nc4 0-0 9.Bf4, Black can either defend it with 9...Ne8 or sacrifice it with 9...Na6 or 9...b6. =7.Bf4= The move 7.Bf4 is similar in spirit to 7.Nd2, in that White hopes to inconvenience Black by a quick attack on d6. After 7...Bg7 8.Qa4+! Bd7 9.Qb3 White attacks both b7 and d6, and Black must be careful not to drift into a passive position after 9...Qc7 10.e4 0-0. More commonly Black prefers to rule out White's queen check with 7...a6, which incidentally threatens to expand on the queenside. White can ignore this with 8.e4 b5 9.Qe2, aiming to quickly overrun Black in the centre with the e4-e5 advance. However, 8.a4 Bg7 is the most popular continuation, when White can aim for a transposition to the Classical Main Line with 9.e4. Another possibility is 9.h3 0-0 10.e3, which gives the bishop a retreat square in case of ...Nh5 and delays further expansion in the centre until the White's development is complete. Although a number of opening books recommended the 7.Bf4 variation for White in the early 21st century, Black appears to be able to maintain the balance in this line. =7.Bg5: Uhlmann Variation= The variation with 7.Bg5 is named after Wolfgang Uhlmann, who played it a few times in the 1960s. Botvinnik also employed it in his 1960 world championship match against Tal. By pinning the knight, White aims to transpose into favourable lines of the Averbakh Variation of the King's Indian Defence, which may occur after 7...0-0 8.Nd2!. To prevent this, Black can either break the pin immediately with 7...h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Nh5, or after developing with 7...Bg7 8.e4 h6 9.Bh4. At this point 9...g5 10.Bg3 Nh5 runs into the pawn sacrifice 11.Bb5+ Kf8 12.e5! when White has a dangerous attack, and in the late 1970s this line was even thought to have refuted the Modern Benoni. Later it was realized that Black can prevent the bishop check with 9...a6!: the only way White can forestall ...g5 and ...Nh5 is with 10.Nd2, but this allows Black to expand on the queenside with 10...b5 and reach a satisfactory position.

It is generally applied to linguistic indicators of the accusative case. An example is the use of the preposition a in Spanish to indicate an animate direct object (the \\"personal a\\"): \\"Jorge llama a Mar√≠a\\".  Esperanto  Officially, in Esperanto, the suffix letter \\"n\\" is used to mark an accusative. But a few modern speakers use the unofficial preposition \\"na\\" instead of the final \\"n\\". \\\\- Mi havas domon. \\\\- Mi havas na domo. \\\\- I have a house.  Hebrew  In Hebrew the preposition ◊ê÷∂◊™ et used for definite nouns in the accusative. Those nouns might be indicated by use of the definite article (◊î Ha \\"the\\"). Otherwise, the object may be determined by a possessive pronominal suffix, by virtue of being a nomen regens within a genitive construction, or being a proper name. To continue with the Hebrew example: Ani ro'eh et ha- kelev. ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊®◊ï◊ê◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊õ◊ú◊ë I see the dog. Ani ro'eh et kalbi. ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊®◊ï◊ê◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊ú◊ë◊ô I see my dog.

On the other hand, \\"I see a dog\\" is simply \\"Ani ro'eh kelev.\\" ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊®◊ï◊ê◊î ◊õ◊ú◊ë This example is obviously a specialized use of the nota accusativi, since Hebrew does not use the nota accusativi unless the noun in question is definite.  Japanese  In Japanese, the particle \\"„Çí\\" (pronounced \\"„Åä\\" o) is the direct object marker and marks the recipient of an action.  Toki Pona  In Toki Pona, the word e is used to mark accusative. Other languages Nota accusativi also exists in Armenian, Greek and other languages. In other languages, especially those that indicate case grammatically, there is usually a separate form (for each declension if declensions exist) to indicate the accusative case. The nota accusativi should not be confused with such case forms, as the term nota accusativi denotes a separate particle indicating the accusative case.

The end-goal a website creator wants to achieve is to provide the users of the website a better experience. ÀùUnless a web site meets the needs of the intended users it will not meet the needs of the organization providing the web site. Web site development should be user-centred, evaluating the evolving design against user requirementsÀù Web Usability definition and components Web Usability includes a small learning curve, easy content exploration, findability, task efficiency, user satisfaction, and automation. These new components of usability are due to the evolution of the Web and personal devices. Examples: automation: auto fill, databases, personal account; efficiency: voice command (Siri, Alexa,...etc); findability. The number of websites has surpassed 1.5 billion thus increasing the need for well-designed websites that serve its users as best as possible in the constantly more competitive market. With good usability, users can find what they are looking for quickly. With the wide spread of mobile devices and wireless internet access, companies are now able to reach a global market with users of all nationalities at any time and almost any place in the world. It is important for websites to be usable regardless of users' language and culture. Most users in developed countries conduct their personal business online: banking, studying, errands, etc., which has enabled people with disabilities to be independent. Websites also need to be accessible for those users. The goal of Web usability is to provide user experience satisfaction by minimizing the time it takes to the user to learn new functionality and page navigation system, allowing the user to accomplish a task efficiently without major roadblocks, providing the user easy ways to overcome roadblocks, and fixing errors and re-adapting to the website or application system and functionality with minimum effort. ÀùManagement and maintenance is important to maintain usability.Àù Ergonomic Requirement Approach According to ISO 9241(Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work with Visual Display Terminals), usability is \\"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use\\". Therefore, web usability can be defined as the ability of Web applications to support web-related tasks with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Effectiveness represents accuracy and completeness when users achieve a specified goal. Efficiency is resource cost in relation to the accuracy and completeness. Satisfaction is the comfort and acceptability of use. ADA Compliance and Web Usability Web sites and application should be made usable for all users.ADA compliance play a major part in web usability a seamless and satisfying experience. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990}.  Mobile Usability  With so many different mobile devices (screen size, make,..), it is crucial to consider how the users accomplish their task on a small screen. Web usability components should be met for the mobile device. The users should be awarded with the same feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment as if they had used a desktop or laptop. \\\\- See also \\"Mobile Usability\\" by Jacob Nielsen Not only is the screen different, nowadays mobile users want different things than desktop users. According to a survey conducted by Google, users want mobile friendly websites as they use them every day for different tasks, i.e. research. Moreover, if a web site is mobile friendly, the users are more likely to return to it but are quick to leave if it is not. In summary, they want a website that is fast and simple to use - quick to load, has big buttons and readable text, and offer a way of engagement (videos, apps, social media, and other ways to contact the company). The three most sough-after things while browsing mobile are locations, opening hours and contact information. Make sure to include them. Check mobile-friendliness of a web site here.  Usability for Multilingual Websites  Multilingual websites should offer the same experience to the users, regardless of the website being in english, German, or Japanese. Websites should render the same way in all languages and all devices. UI Alterations because the language and characters used should still provide the different components of usability.  Web Usability Criteria = Nielson's 10 heuristics  Jakob Nielsen's heuristics are widely adopted in Interface Design. It provides expert reviewers with a set of principles to discover usability problems and then categorize and rate them in a quick way. This set of heuristics includes Visibility of system status, Match between system and the real world and so on. According to Jakob Nielsen, there are 10 general principles: * Visibility of system status: the users should be informed by a system all the time that people can make better decisions. * Match between system and the real world: the systems' language should be similar to users' language. * User control and freedom: It happens many times that users choose the wrong system functions by a mistake, therefore, the system needs to contain the \\"emergency exit\\" to give an option for users to leave the unwanted state without any problem. * Consistency and standards: the users have to be aware that different words, actions and situations can mean the same thing. * Error prevention: System should have a careful design that can prevent a problem that can occur in the first place. * Recognition rather than recall: the system should have the actions and options visible so the users do not need to memorize everything from previous steps. Instructions about the system usability should be always visible. * Flexibility and efficiency of use: the system should have an accelerator to help experienced and inexperienced users to make work faster and easier. * Aestetic and minimalist design: the systems needs to contain only relevant and useful information. The information should be clear and short. * Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: the error messages should be presented in a clear language and understandable form (no codes), and suggest the solutions. * Help and documentation: the information about help and documentation should be easy to find and should focus on the users' tasks.  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  The W3C publishes a set of guidelines on Web accessibility called Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WGAC). The second revision of WCAG, WCAG 2.0, is composed of twelve guidelines, distilled following the four principles that Web content should adhere to: being Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. W3C also provides a detailed checklist for this set of guidelines. Universal Usability Challenges To attain universal usability for Web-based services, designers and developers should take technology variety, user diversity and gaps in user knowledge into consideration. Technology variety arises from a broad range of hardware, software, and network access. People are using different hardware and software to access web services. For example, reading a document with smartphone doc reader is different from opening this document with Microsoft Office on a laptop. Also, opening a webpage with 100KB/s bandwidth may lead to failure when it‚Äôs designed for 2MB/s. Ensuring usability of different platforms can be challenging. User diversity influenced by many factors, including culture, personality, age, gender, race, ethnicity, disabilities, literacy, income, skills and knowledge. Considering the need of different groups is providing access to more people. For example, providing strong contrast mode for people with color weakness will help those people utilize the web service. Universal usability means not only meet users‚Äô current needs, but also build ladders for users to enjoy more features of web services in the future. This gap in user knowledge can be filled with training section, help desk, discuss group and so on. Designers should be aware of the need of extra help. Communication between the designer and the client is also a challenge as it can be hard for the designer to make what the client has envisioned, while the client not fully understanding the amount of time and work required to set up a well designed website. Furthermore, it is also crucial that the designer gives suggestions based on the clients ideas, which is supported by evidence/theory/examples of usability and other functions of the website too. Constant and open communication is important because conflicts or misunderstandings can arise between the two parties.  Understanding Usability  To understand what usability is and what it means it is important to look at it from the customers' perspective. According to Steve Krug nowadays digital literacy is quite high and increasing year-by-year and Àùhow we really use the internetÀù has changed. We have become so used to using the internet and different websites that we do not read them any more but rather scan through them because we are usually in a hurry to find something and have become so used to web pages that there is no need for us to read through them completely as we can successfully filter through and find only the information we need and read more about it should the information found not suffice our needs. Furthermore, we do not care to make the most optimal choices when browsing the web but instead the choices that satisfy our needs - we satisfice. This is again because we are usually in a hurry and there are no real consequences for choosing the incorrect option (i.e. clicking the wrong link) as the back button is only a click away to solve the issue. Similarly, there is no penalty for guessing, thus weighing the options of which button to click and if it will yield the desired results is a waste of time and though. Because of that we don't care enough to understand what we are doing as long as we can use the functions. The effect of that is that users may develop unexpected thinking patterns and ways of using a website - differently than it was intended. Thus, it is important to test each website and its usability. Usability Testing and Improvement Usability testing is evaluating the different components of web usability (learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction) by watching the users accomplishing their task. Usability testing allows to uncover the roadblocks and errors users encounter while accomplishing a task. However, testing is not a one time event but rather an ongoing process. In order to test a web site, we need to have ways of measurement in place. We need to analyze the data gathered and make a plan of improvements, which will be implemented later. After a successful implementation the site needs to be tested again and the process should be repeated again. Evaluation Methods As more results of usability research become available, this leads to the development of methodologies for enhancing web usability. There are a number of usability testing tools available in the market. * Usability testing * Heuristic evaluation * Cognitive walkthrough * Web analytics *International Usability Testing E-commerce In the context of e-commerce websites, the meaning of web-usability is narrowed down to efficiency: triggering sales and/or performing other transactions valuable to the business. Web usability received renewed attention as many early e-commerce websites started failing in 2000. Whereas fancy graphical design had been regarded as indispensable for a successful e-business application during the emergence of internet in the 1990s, web-usability protagonists said quite the reverse was true. They advocated the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid), which had proven to be effective in focusing end-user attention.

The manga was originally published in the monthly sh≈çjo manga anthology Nakayoshi. There are 32 chapters published (including two special stories) and are compiled into seven volumes issued by Kodansha. A 91-episode anime series was produced by TV Aichi, divided into two seasons, aired in Japan from April 2003 to December 2004. The first season is composed of 52 episodes, while the second, entitled Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Pure, lasted for 39. Plot Lucia Nanami, the mermaid princess of the North Pacific Ocean, sets out on land to find the boy that she had saved from a tsunami wave seven years before the beginning of the story, to whom she fell in love and had entrusted her pink pearl. She eventually finds the boy: a teenage surfer named Kaito D≈çmoto. However, Kaito does not recognize Lucia in her human form. She cannot directly tell Kaito who she really is; otherwise, according to mermaid legend, she would turn into bubbles and disappear. Lucia tries to convince Kaito into figuring out who she really is (since the legend doesn't say anything about the other person discovering a mermaid's true identity by him or her self). At the same time, Lucia has been told that a group of water demons have invaded the sea world and she must gather six other Mermaid Princesses and their pearls to bring back the legendary goddess Aqua Regina to stop them. To fulfill this, she joins forces with Hanon and Rina, the Mermaid Princesses who came up to dry land, use their pearls, turn into singing Teen idols, and use their voices as an offensive power. After the water demons fail, the Black Beauty Sisters show up to steal the show. The Mermaid Princess believe in themselves and believe they can defeat the Black Beauty Sisters, which they do. Media=Manga The original manga, created by Yokote with illustrations by Hanamori, began serializing in the September 2002 issue of Nakayoshi. There are a total of 32 chapters, with final one published on the April 2005 issue of the said magazine (released March 2005). There are a total of seven tank≈çbon volumes by Kodansha, the first six containing five chapters each and final one having two. They were released between March 20, 2003 and April 30, 2005. Del Rey Manga acquired the rights to publish the manga for the North American audience. It began releasing the manga on April 2006 under the title Pichi Pichi Pitch: Mermaid Melody. The English translations of the seven volumes were released from April 25, 2006 to October 30, 2007. The seventh volume, aside from the final two chapters, also contains two preview chapters from other manga. Anime An anime adaptation produced by TV Aichi, We've, and Tokyu Agency, animated by Actas and Synergy Japan, and directed by Yoshitaka Fujimoto aired in Japan in two seasons. The first season, simply named Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch and covers manga chapters 1 to 20, aired between April 5, 2003 and March 27, 2004. They were compiled into 14 DVD volumes. The second season, Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Pure, which adapts events from chapters 21 to 30, was aired between April 3 to December 25, 2004. Unlike the first season, Pure was compiled into two DVD box sets containing a total of 11 discs. ADV Films acquired the license to the anime on June 2004 for its North American release, but was eventually dropped due to difficulty in finding backers and securing a TV airing deal. While the acquisition of the license and the production of the English anime predated that of the manga, it is unknown if a release will occur. That is because as of 2009, the anime has been completely dubbed but is being held by Kodansha. In addition, some foreign dubs such as Spanish and French dubbed versions was translated from the unreleased ADV Films' English- dubbed version as a reference when Elastic Rights acquired the licensing rights to Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch from Kodansha in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey and French-speaking Europe and Africa. Likewise, there's an alternative English dub version which it was made in Malaysia by an unknown dubbing studio for Top-Insight International (which released the anime series in Asia outside Japan and Korea on behalf of Kodansha).China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, East Timor, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives It aired on TV3 in 2006 and later moved its sister channel TV9 in English with or without Malay subtitles. However, the Malaysian English dubbed version became very hard to find than the ADV's dubbed version since it never officially released to home video neither in Malaysia nor in English-speaking Asian territories. A total of six theme songs were composed for the anime. The first opening theme, by Miyuki Kanbe, and the first ending theme by Asumi Nakata, are used in the first 28 episodes. For 29th to the 52nd episodes, \\"Rainbow Notes‚ô™\\" by Kanbe and by Nakata, Hitomi Terakado, and Mayumi Asano, are the second opening and ending themes respectively. For Pure, the opening theme is \\"Before the Moment\\" by Eri Kitamura while by Nakata, Terakado, and Asano is the ending song. =Other music= There are also other pieces of music used in the anime, either as battle songs performed by the Mermaid Princesses or their enemies or as insert songs.

The island is situated between the main island of Singapore and the resort island of Sentosa, and is linked to the mainland via Brani Terminal Avenue. The area of Pulau Brani is . Etymology Pulau Brani means \\"Island of the Brave\\" in Malay (berani means \\"brave\\") or \\"Home of the Warriors\\". In an 1828 sketch of the island of Singapore, the island is referred to as Po. Ayer Brani. There are at least three Malay legends and stories pertaining to the island's name. One story propounds that the island got its name because it was the burial ground of old warrior pirates. Another view refers to the island as Pulau Ayer Brani, as recorded in John Turnbull Thomson's 1949 chart, because a stream of fresh water was said to come up from the coastal sea bed or beach, which persisted despite the flow of sea water. The third story has it that there is a well on top of the island, with water of potent qualities. A tank formed of natural rock on the Tanjong Pagar side of the island contained the overflow of water from this well and was used by people for bathing. Pulau Brani is known as san chu shek tui min in Cantonese, meaning \\"opposite the new tin smelting\\" due to a tin smelting plant located on the island in the first half of the twentieth century. The Cantonese also refer to it as cha tin ma thau tui min, meaning \\"opposite Jardine's jetty\\". History Initially, Pulau Brani only had Malay fishing villages along the coast, such as Telok Saga and Kampong Selat Sengkir. In 1845, G.A. Prinsep proposed building a patent ship at Telok Saga which is on the north side of the island. In 1846, Jacob Chinis published plans for the construction of a dry dock on the same side. One of the great coin divers in the 1930s was Wak Melau who stayed at Telok Saga. His father came from Sumatra but he had stayed all his life at Telok Saga as a coin diver and fisherman. Interest in Pulau Brani as a military base was already evident before 1822, with the completion of a chart based on a survey of the island and its coast in that year by Captain Franklin, the Quarter Master in the General Surveyor's Department. By March 1889, the island was made into a navy and military fort, following the decision to transfer forts to the islands south of the new harbour at Keppel Harbour. In line with the above, the Commissariat and the Ordnance Department were moved to Pulau Brani. The bulk of the island was occupied by the Malayan Command Ordnance Depot until 1937 when a new purpose built depot was constructed at Alexandra on the mainland. In 1890, the Straits Trading Company opened a tin smelting plant on Pulau Brani. In February 1942, the plant was destroyed in view of the British surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. However, with the ending of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, the plant was restored and smelting resumed. In 1965, the Straits Trading Company's lease expired and the company soon moved out. The British army had their maritime (water transport) base here, first with the RASC and then the RCT. Many families lived in the married quarters on the island. Primary children attended the British army school located near Buller Jetty, as did the children from army families on Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). Secondary age children had to go to the mainland by ferry, attending the Alexandra Schools at Gillman Barracks, then after 1964 either Bourne (in the Gillman buildings) or the brand new St John's Comprehensive in what is now the United World College in Dover Road. Pulau Brani was selected to house a naval base in early 1971 for the then Singapore Maritime Command (now Republic of Singapore Navy). In those days, there were some settlements along the island's coast. In addition, there were the Pulau Brani Sports Club, the Pulau Brani Community Club and two primary schools - Tai Chong and Telok Saga. In September 1971, work for the development of the naval base commenced, and villagers living on the island were resettled to mainland Singapore. Land reclamation works by the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) commenced in April 1972. The PSA also carried out the removal of reef, dredging, and widening of Selat Sengkir (the channel between Pulau Brani and Sentosa) in February 1973. The new naval base, then known as the Singapore Maritime Command Naval Base, was officially opened by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 26 January 1974. The base was subsequently renamed Brani Naval Base. Subsequently, part of the naval base was redeveloped to build Brani Container Terminal. On 12 October 2000, the rest of the base was officially closed when its facilities were moved to Changi Naval Base. The vacant facilities were taken over by the Singapore Police Force's Police Coast Guard for its new headquarters.

The Six Days Campaign was fought from 10 February to 15 February during which time Napoleon inflicted four defeats on Bl√ºcher's Army of Silesia in the Battle of Champaubert, the Battle of Montmirail, the Battle of Ch√¢teau- Thierry, and the Battle of Vauchamps. Napoleon's 30,000-man army managed to inflict 31,750 casualties on Bl√ºcher's force of 50,000‚Äì56,000. The advance of the Army of Bohemia under Prince Schwarzenberg toward Paris compelled Napoleon to abandon his pursuit of Bl√ºcher's army, which, though badly beaten, was still intact and was soon replenished by the arrival of reinforcements. Five days after the defeat at Vauchamps, the Army of Silesia was back on the offensive. Strategic situation By the start of 1814 the Sixth Coalition had defeated the French both in Germany (see German Campaign of 1813 ) and in Spain (see Peninsular War ¬ß End of the war in Spain), and were poised to invade France from the north-east and south-west. On the north-eastern front three Coalition armies were preparing to invade France, however by the time that Six Days' Campaign ended only two armies had crossed the frontier into France: * The Army of Bohemia or the Grand Army, with 200,000‚Äì210,000 Austrian, Russian, Bavarian, and Wurttemberg soldiers under Prince Schwarzenberg, passed through Swiss territory (violating the cantons' neutrality) and crossed the Rhine between Basel and Schafhausen on 20 December 1813. * The Army of Silesia, with 50,000‚Äì56,000 Prussians and Russians under Prince Bl√ºcher, crossed the Rhine between Rastadt and Koblenz on 1 January 1814. At the same time Wellington invaded France over the Pyrenees. Leaving Marshals Soult and Suchet to defend south-west France, Napoleon commanded the French resistance in north-east France. Napoleon had about 200,000 men in all, of whom upwards of 100,000 were held by the Duke of Wellington on the Spanish frontier (see Invasion of south-west France), and 20,000 more were required to watch the debouches from the Alps. Hence less than 80,000 remained available for the east and north-eastern frontier. If, however, he was weak in numbers, he was now operating in a friendly country, able to find food almost everywhere and had easy lines of communication. Prelude The fighting in north-east France was indecisive during January and the first week of February. During the Battle of Brienne (29 January 1814) Napoleon surprised Bl√ºcher at his headquarters and nearly captured him. Having learnt that Napoleon was at hand Bl√ºcher fell back a few miles to the east the next morning to a strong position covering the exits from the Bar-sur-Aube defile. There he was joined by the Austrian advance guard and together they decided to accept battle‚Äîindeed they had no alternative, as the roads in rear were so choked with traffic that retreat was out of the question. At about noon on 2 February Napoleon attacked them opening the Battle of La Rothi√®re. The weather was terrible, and the ground so heavy that the French guns, the mainstay of Napoleon's whole system of warfare, was useless and in the drifts of snow which at intervals swept across the field, the columns lost their direction and many were severely handled by the Cossacks. Although the French inflicted more damage than they received, Napoleon retired to Lesmont, and from there to Troyes, Marshal Marmont being left to observe the enemy. Owing to the state of the roads, or perhaps to the extraordinary lethargy which always characterized Schwarzenberg's headquarters, no pursuit was attempted. But on 4 February Bl√ºcher, chafing at this inaction, obtained the permission of his own sovereign, King Frederick III Prussia, to transfer his line of operations to the valley of the Marne; Pahlen's corps of Cossacks were assigned to him to cover his left and maintain communication with the Austrians. Believing himself secure behind this screen, Bl√ºcher advanced from Vitry along the roads leading down the valley of the Marne, with his columns widely separated for convenience of subsistence and shelter the latter being almost essential in the terrible weather prevailing. Bl√ºcher himself on the night of 7/8 February was at S√©zanne, on the exposed flank so as to be nearer to his sources of intelligence, and the rest of his army were distributed in four small corps at or near √âpernay, Montmirail and √âtoges; reinforcements also were on their way to join him and were then about Vitry. In the night Bl√ºcher's headquarters were again surprised, and Bl√ºcher learnt that Napoleon himself with his main body was in full march to fall on his scattered detachments. At the same time he heard that Pahlen's Cossacks had been withdrawn forty-eight hours previously, thus completely exposing his flank. He himself retreated towards √âtoges endeavouring to rally his scattered detachments. Campaign Napoleon was too quick for Bl√ºcher: he decimated Lieutenant General Olssufiev's Russian IX Corps at the Battle of Champaubert (10 February). There were 7,000 Russian casualties and Russian General Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev taken prisoner, to approximately 1000 French casualties.. This placed the French army between Bl√ºcher's vanguard and his main body. Napoleon turned his attention to the vanguard and defeated Osten-Sacken and Yorck at Montmirail on 11 February; There were 9,000 Coalition casualties, to 1,100 French casualties. Napoleon attacked and defeated them again the next day at the Battle of Ch√¢teau- Thierry. There were 1,250 Prussian, 1,500 Russian casualties and nine cannons lost, to approximately 600 French casualties. Napoleon then turned on the main body of the Army of Silesia and on 14 February defeated Bl√ºcher in the Battle of Vauchamps near √âtoges, pursuing the latter towards Vertus. There were 7,000 Prussian casualties and 16 cannons lost, to approximately 600 French casualties. These disasters compelled the retreat of the whole Silesian army, and Napoleon, leaving detachments with marshals Mortier and Marmont to deal with them, hurried back to Troyes. Analysis David Zabecki wrote in Germany at War (2014): Michael Leggiere in Bl√ºcher: Scourge of Napoleon (2014) quotes Johann von Nostitz that the campaign displayed Napoleon's \\"talents as a field commander to the highest degree in defeating five enemy corps in sequence\\", but in failing to totally destroy Bl√ºcher's army and driving the remnants back into Germany, Napoleon missed his only opportunity of forcing the Coalition Powers to agree to anything other than peace on their terms. Aftermath Napoleon inflicted further defeats on both Schwarzenberg's and Bl√ºcher's armies. Thus after six weeks fighting the Coalition armies had hardly gained any ground. The Coalition generals still hoped to bring Napoleon to battle against their combined forces. However, after Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube on 20 March, where the Austrians outnumbered his dwindling army 80,000 to 28,000, Napoleon realised that he could no longer continue with his current strategy of defeating the Coalition armies in detail and decided to change his tactics. He had two options: he could fall back on Paris and hope that the Coalition members would come to terms, as capturing Paris with a French army under his command would be difficult and time-consuming; or he could copy the Russians and leave Paris to his enemies (as they had left Moscow to him two years earlier). He decided to move eastward to Saint-Dizier, rally what garrisons he could find, and raise the whole country against the invaders and attack their lines of communications. A letter containing an outline of his plan of action was captured by his enemies. The Coalition commanders held a council of war at Pougy on the 23 March and initially decided to follow Napoleon, but the next day Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick of Prussia along with their advisers reconsidered, and realising the weakness of their opponent, decided to march to Paris (then an open city), and let Napoleon do his worst to their lines of communications. The Coalition armies marched straight for the capital. Marmont and Mortier with what troops they could rally took up a position on Montmartre heights to oppose them. The Battle of Paris ended when the French commanders, seeing further resistance to be hopeless, surrendered the city on 31 March, just as Napoleon, with the wreck of the Guards and a mere handful of other detachments, was hurrying across the rear of the Austrians towards Fontainebleau to join them. Napoleon was forced to announce his unconditional abdication and sign the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Napoleon was sent into exile on the island of Elba and Louis XVIII became king. The Treaty of Paris, signed by representatives of the French monarchy and the Coalition powers, formally ended the War of the Sixth Coalition on 30 May 1814.

Their position in society deteriorated early in India's ancient period, especially in the Indo-Aryan speaking regions, and their subordination continued to be reified well into India's early modern period. Practises such as female infanticide, dowry, child marriage and the taboo on widow remarriage, have had a long duration in India, and have proved difficult to root out, especially in caste society in northern India. During the British East India Company rule (1757‚Äì1857), and the British Raj (1858‚Äì1947), measures aiming at amelioration were enacted, including Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829, Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870, and Age of Consent Act, 1891. Women's rights under the Constitution of India mainly include equality, dignity, and freedom from discrimination; additionally, India has various statutes governing the rights of women. , some women have served in various senior official positions in the Indian government, including that of the President of India, the Prime Minister of India, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, many women in India continue to face significant difficulties. The rates of malnutrition are exceptionally high among adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women in India, with repercussions for children's health. Violence against women, especially sexual violence, has been on the rise in India. Women in India during British rule File:Muslim girl india1844.jpgA little Mussulman girl, Calcutta, 1844 lithograph of a little Muslim girl in India wearing paijamas and kurti; drawn by Emily Eden, wife of the Governor-General of India, George Eden File:BathingGhatBanares1885.jpgWomen and children bathing and collecting water at a ghat in Banares (Varanasi), the holy Hindu city on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, 1885 File:Anandibai gopalrao joshi.jpgAnandibai Joshi MD Class of 1886, Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania File:Pandita Ramabai Sarasvati 1858-1922 front-page- portrait.jpgPandita Ramabai Saraswati During the British Raj, many reformers such as Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Jyotirao Phule fought for the betterment of women. Peary Charan Sarkar, a former student of Hindu College, Calcutta and a member of \\"Young Bengal\\", set up the first free school for girls in India in 1847 in Barasat, a suburb of Calcutta (later the school was named Kalikrishna Girls' High School). While this might suggest that there was no positive British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault n√©e Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell n√©e Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under Governor-General William Cavendish- Bentinck in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's crusade for improvement in the situation of widows led to the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. Many women reformers such as Pandita Ramabai also helped the cause of women. Kittur Chennamma, queen of the princely state Kittur in Karnataka, led an armed rebellion against the British in response to the Doctrine of lapse. Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, led the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British. She is now widely considered as a national hero. Begum Hazrat Mahal, the co-ruler of Awadh, was another ruler who led the revolt of 1857. She refused deals with the British and later retreated to Nepal. The Begums of Bhopal were also considered notable female rulers during this period. They were trained in martial arts. Chandramukhi Basu, Kadambini Ganguly and Anandi Gopal Joshi were some of the earliest Indian women to obtain a degree. In 1917, the first women's delegation met the Secretary of State to demand women's political rights, supported by the Indian National Congress. The All India Women's Education Conference was held in Pune in 1927, it became a major organisation in the movement for social change. In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed, stipulating fourteen as the minimum age of marriage for a girl.Ambassador of Hindu Muslim Unity, Ian Bryant Wells Mahatma Gandhi, himself a victim of child marriage at the age of thirteen, he later urged people to boycott child marriages and called upon young men to marry child widows. Independent India Female Safety Index per state according to the Tata Strategic Management Group. Light green indicates greatest safety; yellow, medium safety and light red, least safety. Women in India now participate fully in areas such as education, sports, politics, media, art and culture, service sectors, science and technology, etc. Indira Gandhi, who served as Prime Minister of India for an aggregate period of fifteen years, is the world's longest serving woman Prime Minister. The Constitution of India guarantees to all Indian women equality (Article 14), no discrimination by the State (Article 15(1)), equality of opportunity (Article 16), equal pay for equal work (Article 39(d)) and Article 42. In addition, it allows special provisions to be made by the State in favour of women and children (Article 15(3)), renounces practices derogatory to the dignity of women (Article 51(A) (e)), and also allows for provisions to be made by the State for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. (Article 42). Feminist activism in India gained momentum in the late 1970s. One of the first national-level issues that brought women's groups together was the Mathura rape case. The acquittal of policemen accused of raping a young girl Mathura in a police station led to country-wide protests in 1979‚Äì1980. The protest, widely covered by the national media, forced the Government to amend the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Indian Penal Code; and created a new offence, custodial rape. Female activists also united over issues such as female infanticide, gender bias, women's health, women's safety, and women's literacy. Since alcoholism is often associated with violence against women in India, many women groups launched anti-liquor campaigns in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and other states. Many Indian Muslim women have questioned the fundamental leaders' interpretation of women's rights under the Shariat law and have criticised the triple talaq system (see below about 2017). Mary Roy won a lawsuit in 1986, against the inheritance legislation of her Keralite Syrian Christian community in the Supreme Court. The judgement ensured equal rights for Syrian Christian women with their male siblings in regard to their ancestral property. Until then, her Syrian Christian community followed the provisions of the Travancore Succession Act of 1916 and the Cochin Succession Act, 1921, while elsewhere in India the same community followed the Indian Succession Act of 1925. In the 1990s, grants from foreign donor agencies enabled the formation of new women-oriented NGOs. Self-help groups and NGOs such as Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) have played a major role in the advancement of women's rights in India. Many women have emerged as leaders of local movements; for example, Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan. In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from Sabarimala Shrine as they were of the menstruating age. However, on 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on the entry of women. It said that discrimination against women on any grounds, even religious, is unconstitutional. The Government of India declared 2001 as the Year of Women's Empowerment (Swashakti). The National Policy For The Empowerment Of Women came was passed in 2001. In 2006, the case of Imrana, a Muslim rape victim, was highlighted by the media. Imrana was raped by her father-in-law. The pronouncement of some Muslim clerics that Imrana should marry her father-in-law led to widespread protests, and finally Imrana's father-in-law was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The verdict was welcomed by many women's groups and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. According to a 2011 poll conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, India was the \\"fourth most dangerous country\\" in the world for women, India was also noted as the worst country for women among the G20 countries, however, this report has faced criticism for promoting inaccurate perceptions. On 9 March 2010, one day after International Women's day, Rajya Sabha passed the Women's Reservation Bill requiring that 33% of seats in India's Parliament and state legislative bodies be reserved for women. In October 2017 another poll published by Thomson Reuters Foundation found that Delhi was the fourth most dangerous megacity (total 40 in the world) for women and it was also the worst megacity in the world for women when it came to sexual violence, risk of rape and harassment. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 is a legislative act in India that seeks to protect women from sexual harassment at their place of work. The Act came into force from 9 December 2013. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 introduced changes to the Indian Penal Code, making sexual harassment an expressed offence under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense. It also made acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which could extend to life imprisonment and with fine. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954. On 22 August 2017, the Indian Supreme Court deemed instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) unconstitutional. In 2018, a survey by Thomson Reuters Foundation termed India as the world's most dangerous country for women due to high risk of sexual violence. Although National Commission for Women rejected the report stating that the sample size was small in the number of people surveyed and could in no way reflect the state of affairs in a country of 1.3 billion people. National Commission for Women (NCW) also pointed out that there could be no doubt that India is far ahead of a number of countries in terms of women's rights. The survey was similarly rejected by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies on the grounds that it lacked transparency with respect to sample size and possible selection bias. The report has also been rejected by the Indian government. Union minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore criticized the Indian National Congress for using this survey to damage the reputation of the Modi government and that the survey that was based on \\"perception\\" and \\"afar from any solid facts or numbers\\". Also in 2018, the Supreme Court of India struck down a law making it a crime for a man to have sex with a married woman without the permission of her husband. Prior to November 2018, women were forbidden to climb Agasthyarkoodam. A court ruling removed the prohibition. Timeline of women's achievements in India Rukhmabai, the second practising female physician in India, the publicity around whose child marriage and subsequent dissolution led to the Age of Consent Act, 1891 Sarla Thakral became the first Indian woman to fly an aircraft in 1936.

Politics India has one of the highest number of female politicians in the world. Women have held high offices in India including that of the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Leader of the Opposition. The Indian states Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tripura have implemented 50% reservation for women in PRIs. Majority of candidates in these Panchayats are women. Currently 100% of elected members in Kodassery Panchayat in Kerala are women. There are currently 2 female chief ministers in India as of Sept 2018. As of 2018, 12 out of 29 states and the union territory of Delhi have had at least one female Chief Minister. Culture The status of women in India is strongly connected to family relations. In India, the family is seen as crucially important, and in most of the country the family unit is patrilineal. Families are usually multi-generational, with the bride moving to live with the in-laws. Families are usually hierarchical, with the elders having authority over the younger generations, and men over women. The vast majority of marriages are monogamous (one husband and one wife), but both polygyny and polyandry in India have a tradition among some populations in India. Weddings in India can be quite expensive. Most marriages in India are arranged. With regard to dress, a sari (a long piece of fabric draped around the body) and salwar kameez are worn by women all over India. A bindi is part of a woman's make-up. Despite common belief, the bindi on the forehead does not signify marital status; however, the Sindoor does. Rangoli (or Kolam) is a traditional art very popular among Indian women. In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from Sabarimala Shrine as they were of the menstruating age. On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on the entry of women. It said that discrimination against women on any grounds, even religious, is unconstitutional. Military and law enforcement File:Indian army lady officer.jpgA female officer in the Indian Army briefing Russian soldiers during a joint exercise in 2015. File:Women personnel of India's Border Security Force.jpgWomen of the Border Security Force at the Indian Pakistan border. The Indian Armed Forces began recruiting women to non-medical positions in 1992. The Indian Army began inducting women officers in 1992. The Border Security Force (BSF) began recruiting female officers in 2013. On 25 March 2017, Tanushree Pareek became the first female combat officer commissioned by the BSF. On 24 October 2015, the Indian government announced that women could serve as fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force (IAF), having previously only been permitted to fly transport aircraft and helicopters. The decision means that women are now eligible for induction in any role in the IAF. In 2016, India announced a decision to allow women to take up combat roles in all sections of its army and navy. As of 2014, women made up 3% of Indian Army personnel, 2.8% of Navy personnel, and 8.5% of Air Force personnel. As of 2016, women accounted for 5% of all active and reserve Indian Armed forces personnel. In 1972 Kiran Bedi became the First Lady Indian Police Service Officer and was the only woman in a batch of 80 IPS Officers, she joined the AGMUT Cadre. In 1992 Asha Sinha a 1982 Batch IPS Officer became the First Woman Commandant in the Paramilitary forces of India when she was posted as Commandant, Central Industrial Security Force in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited. Kanchan Chaudhary Bhattacharya the second Lady IPS Officer of India belonging to the 1973 Batch became the first Lady Director General of Police of a State in India when she was appointed DGP of Uttarakhand Police. In 2018 an IPS Officer Archana Ramasundram of 1980 Batch became the first Woman to become the Director General of Police of a Paramilitary Force as DG, Sashastra Seema Bal. In March 2018, Delhi Police announced that it would begin to induct women into its SWAT team. On February 17, 2020 the Supreme Court of India said that women officers in the Indian Army can get command positions at par with male officers. The court said that the government's arguments against it were discriminatory, disturbing and based on stereotype. The court also said that permanent commission to all women officers should be made available regardless of their years of service. The government had earlier said that women commanders would not be acceptable to some troops. Education and economic development According to 1992‚Äì93 figures, only 9.2% of the households in India were headed by women. However, approximately 35% of the households below the poverty line were found to be headed by women. PDF version Education Women attend an adult literacy class in Thiruputkuzhi, Tamil Nadu state. The overall female literacy rate in the state in 2011 was 73.44%. In the previous decade, it increased by 9%. Though it is sharply increasing, the female literacy rate in India is less than the male literacy rate. Far fewer girls than boys are enrolled in school, and many girls drop out. In urban India, girls are nearly on a par with boys in terms of education. However, in rural India, girls continue to be less educated than boys. According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of Kerala and Mizoram have approached universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements in the social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy. Under the Non-Formal Education programme (NFE), about 40% of the NFE centres in states and 10% of the centres in UTs are exclusively reserved for women. As of 2000, about 300,000 NFE centres were catering to about 7.42 million children. About 120,000 NFE centres were exclusively for girls. According to a 1998 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the chief barriers to female education in India are inadequate school facilities (such as sanitary facilities), shortage of female teachers and gender bias in the curriculum (female characters being depicted as weak and helpless). The literacy rate is lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 60.6% for women, while for men it is 81.3%. The 2011 census, however, indicated a 2001‚Äì2011 decadal literacy growth of 9.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade. There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India: effective literacy rates (age 7 and above) in 2011 were 82.14% for men and 65.46% for women. (population aged 15 or older, data from 2015). Workforce participation A woman working at an Aadhaar center in India. Contrary to common perception, a large percentage of women in India are actively engaged in traditional and non-traditional work. National data collection agencies accept that statistics seriously understate women's contribution as workers. However, there are far fewer women than men in the paid workforce. In urban India, women participate in the workforce in impressive numbers. For example, in the software industry 30% of the workforce is female. In rural India in the agriculture and allied industrial sectors, women account for as much as 89.5% of the labour force. In overall farm production, women's average contribution is estimated at 55% to 66% of the total labour. According to a 1991 World Bank report, women accounted for 94% of total employment in dairy production in India. Women constitute 51% of the total employed in forest-based small-scale enterprises. =Gender pay gap= In 2017, a study by Monster Salary Index (MSI) showed the overall gender pay gap in India was 20 percent. It found that the gap was narrower in the early years of experience. While men with 0‚Äì2 years of experience earned 7.8 percent higher median wages than women, in the experience group of 6‚Äì10 years of experience, the pay gap was 15.3 percent. The pay gap becomes wider at senior level positions as the men with 11 and more years of tenure earned 25 percent higher median wages than women. Based on the educational background, men with a bachelor's degree earned on average 16 percent higher median wages than women in years 2015, 2016 and 2017, while master's degree holders experience even higher pay gap. Men with a four- or five-year degree or the equivalent of a master's degree have on average earned 33.7 percent higher median wages than women. While India passed the Equal Remuneration Act way back in 1976, which prohibits discrimination in remuneration on grounds of sex. But in practice, the pay disparity still exist. =Women-owned businesses= One of the most famous female business success stories, from the rural sector, is the Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad. Started in 1959 by seven women in Mumbai with a seed capital of only Rs.80, it had an annual turnover of more than Rs. 800 crore (over $109 million) in 2018. It provides employment to 43,000 (in 2018) women across the country. One of the largest dairy co-operatives in the world, Amul, began by mobilizing rural women in Anand in the western state of Gujarat. =Notable women in business= In 2006, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, who founded Biocon, one of India's first biotech companies, was rated India's richest woman. Lalita D. Gupte and Kalpana Morparia were the only businesswomen in India who made the list of the Forbes World's Most Powerful Women in 2006. Gupte ran ICICI Bank, India's second-largest bank, until October 2006 and Morparia is CEO of JP Morgan India. Shaw remained the richest self-made woman in 2018, coming in at 72nd place in terms of net worth in Forbes's annual rich list. She was the 4th and last female in the list, thereby showing that 96 of 100 the richest entities in the country continued to be male controlled directly or indirectly. According to the ‚ÄòKotak Wealth Hurun ‚Äì Leading Wealthy Women 2018‚Äô list, which compiled the 100 wealthiest Indian women based on their net worth as on 30 June 2018 Shaw was only one of two women, the other being Jayshree Ullal, who did not inherit their current wealth from family relatives in the top ten. However, India has a strong history of many women with inherited wealth establishing large enterprises or launching successful careers in their own rights. Land and property rights Women harvesting rice paddy in Tamil Nadu. Women rarely own land in their own names, although they often work in agriculture. In most Indian families, women do not own any property in their own names, and do not get a share of parental property. Due to weak enforcement of laws protecting them, women continue to have little access to land and property. In India, women's property rights vary depending on religion, and tribe, and are subject to a complex mix of law and custom, but in principle the move has been towards granting women equal legal rights, especially since the passing of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005. The Hindu personal laws of 1956 (applying to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains) gave women rights to inheritances. However, sons had an independent share in the ancestral property, while the daughters' shares were based on the share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but a son would continue to have a share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing domestic abuse and harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. Thanks to an amendment of the Hindu laws in 2005, women now have the same status as men. In 1986, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Shah Bano, an elderly divorced Muslim woman, was eligible for alimony. However, the decision was opposed by fundamentalist Muslim leaders, who alleged that the court was interfering in their personal law. The Union Government subsequently passed the Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights Upon Divorce) Act. Similarly, Christian women have struggled over the years for equal rights in divorce and succession. In 1994, all churches, jointly with women's organizations, drew up a draft law called the Christian Marriage and Matrimonial Causes Bill. However, the government has still not amended the relevant laws. In 2014, the Law Commission of India has asked the government to modify the law to give Christian women equal property rights. Crimes against women The map shows the comparative rate of violence against women in Indian states and union territories in 2012. Crime rate data per 100,000 women in this map is the broadest definition of crime against women under Indian law. It includes rape, sexual assault, insult to modesty, kidnapping, abduction, cruelty by intimate partner or relatives, trafficking, persecution for dowry, dowry deaths, indecency, and all other crimes listed in Indian Penal Code. Crime against women such as rape, acid throwing, dowry killings, honour killings, and the forced prostitution of young girls has been reported in India. Police records in India show a high incidence of crimes against women. The National Crime Records Bureau reported in 1998 that by 2010 growth in the rate of crimes against women would exceed the population growth rate. Earlier, many crimes against women were not reported to police due to the social stigma attached to rape and molestation. Official statistics show a dramatic increase in the number of reported crimes against women. Acid throwing A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey says that India is the fourth most dangerous place in the world for women to live in. The survey itself has been criticized for bias. Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks has been rising. Child marriage Child marriage has been traditionally prevalent in India but is not so continued in Modern India to this day. Historically, child brides would live with their parents until they reached puberty. In the past, child widows were condemned to a life of great agony, shaved heads, living in isolation, and being shunned by society. Although child marriage was outlawed in 1860, it is still a common practice. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 is the relevant legislation in the country. According to UNICEF's \\"State of the World‚Äôs Children-2009\\" report, 47% of India's women aged 20‚Äì24 were married before the legal age of 18, rising to 56% in rural areas. The report also showed that 40% of the world's child marriages occur in India. Domestic violence Domestic violence in India is endemic. Around 70% of women in India are victims of domestic violence, according to Renuka Chowdhury, former Union minister for Women and Child Development. Domestic violence was legally addressed in the 1980s when the 1983 Criminal Law Act introduced section 498A \\"Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty\\". The National Crime Records Bureau reveal that a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes, a woman is raped every 29 minutes, a dowry death occurs every 77 minutes, and one case of cruelty committed by either the husband or relative of the husband occurs every nine minutes. This occurs despite the fact that women in India are legally protected from domestic abuse under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. In India, domestic violence toward women is considered as any type of abuse that can be considered a threat; it can also be physical, psychological, or sexual abuse to any current or former partner. Domestic violence is not handled as a crime or complaint, it is seen more as a private or family matter. In determining the category of a complaint, it is based on caste, class, religious bias and race which also determines whether action is to be taken or not. Many studies have reported about the prevalence of the violence and have taken a criminal-justice approach, but most woman refuse to report it. These women are guaranteed constitutional justice, dignity and equality but continue to refuse based on their sociocultural contexts. As the women refuse to speak of the violence and find help, they are also not receiving the proper treatment. Dowry A map of the Indian dowry death rate per 100,000 people, 2012. In 1961, the Government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act, making dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal. However, many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides and murders have been reported. In the 1980s, numerous such cases were reported. In 1985, the Dowry Prohibition (maintenance of lists of presents to the bride and bridegroom) Rules were framed. According to these rules, a signed list should be maintained of presents given at the time of the marriage to the bride and the bridegroom. The list should contain a brief description of each present, its approximate value, the name of who has given the present, and relationship to the recipient. However, such rules are rarely enforced. A 1997 report claimed that each year at least 5,000 women in India die dowry-related deaths, and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional. The term for this is \\"bride burning\\" and is criticised within India itself. In 2011, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths. Unofficial estimates claim the figures are at least three times as high. Female infanticide and sex-selective abortion A map of India's child sex ratio, 2011. In India, the male-female sex ratio is skewed dramatically in favour of men, the chief reason being the high number of women who die before reaching adulthood. Tribal societies in India have a less skewed sex ratio than other caste groups. This is in spite of the fact that tribal communities have far lower income levels, lower literacy rates, and less adequate health facilities. Many experts suggest the higher number of men in India can be attributed to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions. The sex ratio is particularly bad in the north-western area of the country, particularly in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. Ultrasound scanning constitutes a major leap forward in providing for the care of mother and baby, and with scanners becoming portable, these advantages have spread to rural populations. However, ultrasound scans often reveal the sex of the baby, allowing pregnant women to decide to abort female foetuses and try again later for a male child. This practice is usually considered the main reason for the change in the ratio of male to female children being born. In 1994 the Indian government passed a law forbidding women or their families from asking about the sex of the baby after an ultrasound scan (or any other test which would yield that information) and also expressly forbade doctors or any other persons from providing that information. In practice this law (like the law forbidding dowries) is widely ignored, and levels of abortion on female foetuses remain high and the sex ratio at birth keeps getting more skewed. Female infanticide (killing of infant girls) is still prevalent in some rural areas. Sometimes this is infanticide by neglect, for example families may not spend money on critical medicines or withhold care from a sick girl. Continuing abuse of the dowry tradition has been one of the main reasons for sex-selective abortions and female infanticides in India. Honor killings Honor killings have been reported in northern regions of India, mainly in the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, as a result of the girl marrying without the family's acceptance, and sometimes for marrying outside her caste or religion. Haryana is notorious for incidents of honor killings, which have been described as \\"chillingly common in villages of Haryana\\". In contrast, honor killings are rare to non-existent in South India and the western Indian states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. In some other parts of India, notably West Bengal, honor killings completely ceased about a century ago, largely due to the activism and influence of reformists such as Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Vidyasagar and Raja Ram Mohan Roy. In 2010, the Supreme Court of India issued notice in regard to honor killings to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Accusations of witchcraft Violence against women related to accusations of witchcraft occurs in India, particularly in parts of Northern India. Belief in the supernatural among the Indian population is strong, and lynchings for witchcraft are reported by the media. In Assam and West Bengal between 2003 and 2008 there were around 750 deaths related to accusations of witchcraft. Officials in the state of Chhattisgarh reported in 2008 that at least 100 women are maltreated annually as suspected witches. Rape People in Delhi, India protesting after a young student was gang-raped in Delhi in December 2012. Rape in India has been described by Radha Kumar as one of India's most common crimes against women and by the UN‚Äôs human-rights chief as a \\"national problem\\". Since the 1980s, women's rights groups lobbied for marital rape to be declared unlawful, but the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 still maintains the marital exemption by stating in its exception clause under Section 375, that: \\"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape\\". While per-capita reported incidents are quite low compared to other countries, even developed countries, a new case is reported every 20 minutes. In fact, as per the NCRB data released by the government of India in 2018, a rape is reported in India in every 15 minutes. New Delhi has one of the highest rate of rape- reports among Indian cities. Sources show that rape cases in India have doubled between 1990 and 2008. Sexual harassment Eve teasing is a euphemism used for sexual harassment or molestation of women by men. Many activists blame the rising incidence of sexual harassment against women on the influence of \\"Western culture\\". In 1987, The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act was passed to prohibit indecent representation of women through advertisements or in publications, writings, paintings or in any other manner. Of the total number of crimes against women reported in 1990, half related to molestation and harassment in the workplace. In 1997, in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court of India took a strong stand against sexual harassment of women in the workplace. The Court also laid down detailed guidelines for prevention and redressal of grievances. The National Commission for Women subsequently elaborated these guidelines into a Code of Conduct for employers. In 2013 India's top court investigated on a law graduate's allegation that she was sexually harassed by a recently retired Supreme Court judge. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act came into force in December 2013, to prevent Harassment of women at workplace. A study by ActionAid UK found that 80% of women in India had experienced sexual harassment ranging from unwanted comments, being groped or assaulted. Many incidents go unreported as the victims fear being shunned by their families. Trafficking The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act was passed in 1956. However many cases of trafficking of young girls and women have been reported.

Participation of women in social life The degree to which women participate in public life, that is being outside the home, varies by region and background. For example, the Rajputs, a patrilineal clan inhabiting parts of India, especially the north-western area, have traditionally practiced ghunghat, and many still do to this day. In recent years however, more women have started to challenge such social norms: for instance women in rural Haryana are increasingly rejecting the ghunghat. In India, most population (about two thirds) is rural, and, as such, lives in tight-knit communities where it is very easy for a woman to ruin her family's 'honor' through her behavior. The concept of family honor is especially prevalent in northern India. Izzat is a concept of honor prevalent in the culture of North India and Pakistan. Izzat applies to both sexes, but in different ways. Women must uphold the 'family honor' by being chaste, passive and submissive, while men must be strong, brave, and be willing and able to control the women of their families. The rural areas surrounding Delhi are among the most conservative in India: it has been estimated that 30% of all honor killings of India take place in Western Uttar Pradesh, while Haryana has been described as \\"one of India's most conservative when it comes to caste, marriage and the role of women. Deeply patriarchal, caste purity is paramount and marriages are arranged to sustain the status quo.\\" In 2018 the Supreme Court of India lifted a centuries-old ban prohibiting women between the ages of 10 and 50 from entering Sabarimala temple in Kerala. In 2019 two women entered the temple under police protection. Hindu nationalists protested the women's entry and Sreedharan Pillai, State President of the Kerala branch of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (of which Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is a member) described the women's entry into the temple as \\"a conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples.\\" Prime Minister Modi said, \\"We knew that the communists do not respect Indian history, culture and spirituality but nobody imagined they will have such hatred,\\" The shrine is dedicated to the worship of Lord Ayyappa, a celibate deity, and adherents believe the presence of women would \\"pollute\\" the site and go against the wishes of the patron deity. The two women had to go into hiding after entering the temple and were granted 24 hour police protection. One of the women was locked out of her home by her husband and had to move in to a shelter. Dozens of women seeking entry to temple have since been turned back by demonstrators. Prior to November 2018, women were forbidden to climb Agasthyarkoodam. A court ruling removed the prohibition. Health Community health worker preparing a vaccine in Odisha The average female life expectancy today in India is low compared to many countries, but it has shown gradual improvement over the years. In many families, especially rural ones, girls and women face nutritional discrimination within the family, and are anaemic and malnourished. Almost half of adolescent girls are chronically malnourished. In addition, poor nutrition during pregnancy often leads to birth complications. The maternal mortality in India is the 56th highest in the world. 42% of births in the country are supervised in Medical Institution. In rural areas, most of women deliver with the help of women in the family, contradictory to the fact that the unprofessional or unskilled deliverer lacks the knowledge about pregnancy. Family planning The average woman living in a rural area in India has little or no control over becoming pregnant. Women, particularly in rural areas, do not have access to safe and self-controlled methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like sterilisation, or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. Sterilisation accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female sterilisation accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations. The contraceptive prevalence rate for 2007/2008 was estimated at 54.8%. Women from lower castes Lower caste women in India have seen significant improvement in their status. Educated and financially well-off Dalit women used politics to achieve status, however, that many Dalit women who were involved in politics later declined due to increasing income and educational levels. The status of Dalit women within households is also noted to have been improved. Sex ratios A sign in an Indian hospital stating that prenatal sex determination is a crime. India has a highly skewed sex ratio, which is attributed to sex-selective abortion and female infanticide affecting approximately one million female babies per year. In, 2011, government stated India was missing three million girls and there are now 48 less girls per 1,000 boys. Despite this, the government has taken further steps to improve the ratio, and the ratio is reported to have been improved in recent years. The number of missing women totaled 100 million across the world. The male-to- female ratio is high in favor toward men in developing countries in Asia, including India, than that of areas such as North America. Along with abortion, the high ratio of men in India is a result of sex selection, where physicians are given the opportunity to incorrectly determine the sex of a child during the ultrasound. India currently has a problem known as the \\"missing women\\", but it has been present for quite some time. The female mortality in 2001 was 107.43. The deaths of these \\"missing women\\" were attributed to the death history rate of women in India starting in 1901. The gap between the two gender titles is a direct response to the gender bias within India. Men and women in India have unequal health and education rights. Male education and health are more of a priority, so women's death rates are increasing. The argument continues that a lack of independence that women are not allowed to have is a large contributor to these fatalities. Women in India have a high fertility rate and get married at a young age. Those who are given more opportunity and rights are more likely to live longer and contribute to the economy rather than that of a woman expected to serve as a wife starting at a young age and continuing the same responsibilities for the rest of her life. As women continue to \\"disappear,\\" the sex ratio turns its favor toward men. In turn, this offsets reproduction and does not allow for a controlled reproductive trend. While the excess mortality of women is relatively high, it cannot be blamed completely for the unequal sex ratio in India. However, it is a large contributor considering the precedence that Indian men have over women. Sanitation In rural areas, schools have been reported to have gained the improved sanitation facility. Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys. Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others. Access to sanitation in Bihar has been discussed. According to an estimate from 2013, about 85% of the rural households in Bihar have no access to a toilet; and this creates a dangerous situation for women and girls who are followed, attacked and raped in the fields. In 2011 a \\"Right to Pee\\" (as called by the media) campaign began in Mumbai, India's largest city. Women, but not men, have to pay to urinate in Mumbai, despite regulations against this practice. Women have also been sexually assaulted while urinating in fields. Thus, activists have collected more than 50,000 signatures supporting their demands that the local government stop charging women to urinate, build more toilets, keep them clean, provide sanitary napkins and a trash can, and hire female attendants. In response, city officials have agreed to build hundreds of public toilets for women in Mumbai, and some local legislators are now promising to build toilets for women in every one of their districts.

P. 51-52 The plan advocated avoiding direct engagement with French emperor, Napoleon I, which had resulted from fear of the emperor's now legendary prowess in battle. Consequently, the Allies planned to engage and defeat Napoleon's marshals and generals separately, and thus weaken his army while they built up an overwhelming force even he could not defeat. It was decided upon after a series of defeats and near disasters at the hands of Napoleon at L√ºtzen, Bautzen and Dresden.

It can be taken by a boat from Marina South Pier. The word kusu also means flatulence in Tamil, one of Singapore's official languages‚Äîhowever, this is in no way related to the name of the island, and is a misconception. From two outcrops on a reef, the island was enlarged and transformed into an island of . The legend behind the island says that a magical tortoise turned itself into an island to save two shipwrecked sailors, one a Malay and the other a Chinese. At the top of the rugged hillock on Kusu Island stands three keramats (or holy shrines of Malay holy figures) to commemorate a pious man (Syed Abdul Rahman), his mother (Nenek Ghalib) and his sister (Puteri Fatimah), all of whom once lived in the 19th century. Many devotees will climb the 152 steps leading up to the kramats to pray for wealth, good marriage, good health and harmony. The shrines are also popular with childless couples who would pray for children. Despite misconceptions, they do not pray to the keramats, but at the sites. Also located on Kusu island is the popular Chinese temple dedicated to both Da Bo Gong (Â§ß‰ºØÂÖ¨), or Tua Pek Kong (Grand Uncle), and Na Tuk Kong (Dato Keramat or \\"ÊãøÁù£ÂÖ¨\\"). Built in 1923 by a wealthy businessman, the temple houses two main Taoist deities, Da Bo Gong and Guan Yin (\\"ËßÇÈü≥\\", or Goddess of Mercy). The former is highly regarded as having the power to confer prosperity, cure diseases, calm the sea and avert danger, while Guan Yin is known as the \\"Giver of Sons\\". Da Bogong Temple on Kusu Island. Marble Tortoise statues on Kusu Island. It is popular for its lagoons, pristine beaches and general tranquil settings. Visits are often made by occasional ferry trips from the nearby Marina South Pier (formerly from Clifford Pier) to see the famous wishing well and the Tortoise Sanctuary. Afternoon picnics on the island are also very popular, although no food or beverage service providers are situated on the island. A stand-alone open-air hawker centre is located in the middle of the island but it is only open and running during certain periods of the year, such as during festivals or pilgrimages to the keramats or the temple. No overnight stays are permitted on the island. However, most ferries to Kusu Island also route past Saint John's Island, which does have overnight lodging offered.

Early and family life Makemie was born in Ramelton, County Donegal, part of the Province of Ulster in the north of Ireland. He attended the University of Glasgow, where he underwent a religious conversion and enrolled as \\"Franciscus Makemus Scoto- Hyburnus\\". He went on to become a clergyman and be ordained by the Presbytery of Laggan, in West Ulster, in 1681. Ten years after emigrating to America in 1682, as discussed below, Makemie married Naomi Anderson, the daughter of a successful Maryland businessman and landowner. Francis and Naomi had two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth. Ministry in America Rehoboth Presbyterian Church At the call of Colonel William Stevens, an Episcopalian from Rehobeth, Maryland, Rev. Makemie was sent as a missionary to America, arriving in Maryland in 1683. Makemie initially preached in Somerset County, Maryland and established the Rehobeth Presbyterian Church the oldest Presbyterian Church in America, near the Coventry Parish Church which Col. Stevens attended. The ruins of Coventry Parish Church still stand nearby. Makemie also supported himself as a merchant and traveled among other Scots-Irish communities, many of which were isolated, as well as suspicious of each other. In the eastern part of Somerset County (that split to become Worcester County, Maryland in 1742 and erected All Hallows Episcopal Church about a decade later), Makemie founded the first Presbyterian community in the Town of Snow Hill, which had been founded in 1686 and named for a London neighborhood. Snow Hill was to be the center of the Presbytery of Snow Hill, which received a charter from Maryland's General Assembly, but was never activated. Nonetheless, a Presbyterian Church was erected early on in Snow Hill, and the current Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church is the fourth building and the site, as well as the congregation's third location in Snow Hill. The first building was near the Pocomoke River, which was the chief means of travel in the 17th and early 18th centuries and how Makemie often traveled to visit his congregations at Rehoboth and further away, as well on what later became U.S. Route 13 down the Delmarva Peninsula. This log building was replaced by a frame building, a little further away from the water but still subject to flooding. Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, Snow Hill, Maryland Rev. Makemie traveled widely on along the American coast between North Carolina and New York, as well as participated in the West Indies Trade. In 1692, the year Makemie was granted land in Accomack County, Virginia, he and seven other Presbyterian ministers gathered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and either then or in 1706 founded what later came to be known as the Presbytery of Philadelphia, the first in America, with Makemie as its moderator.http://www.makemiepresbyterianchurch.org/history.html He also helped found churches in Salisbury, Princess Anne, Berlin and Pocomoke City as well as in two places on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, both in Accomack County further down the Delmarva Peninsula. He also published. In 1691, Makemie's 'Catechism' attacked some of the tenets of the Society of Friends. Abolitionist Quaker George Keith, then published a reply. Makemie responded in the 'Answer' already mentioned, which Congregational Rev. Increase Mather thought by 'a reverent and judicious minister.'dnb While living in Barbados, Makemie on 28 December 1696 wrote 'Truths in a True Light, or a Pastoral Letter to the Reformed Protestants in Barbadoes', which was published at Edinburgh in 1699, the year he returned to Accomac and produced a certificate from Barbados and was allowed to preach in his own dwelling in Pocomoke, Maryland, or at designated locations in Accomac, Virginia. He then went to London to resolve questions about his handling episcopal duties in his ministry, and brought back two missionaries.dnb In 1707, Makemie was arrested by Lord Cornbury, the Governor of New York, for preaching without a license from the Crown as required under the Toleration Act. He spent two months in jail before being released on bail. Then at trial he produced his preaching license from Barbados, whereupon he was acquitted and released, but had incurred heavy legal costs.dnb, citing History of the Rise, Progress, Genius, and Character of American Presbyterianism (Washington, 1839) This became a landmark case in favor of religious freedom in America.http://www.makemiepresbyterianchurch.org/history.html The controversial Lord Cornbury was also recalled to England the following year. Historical Marker on U.S. Route 13 Death and legacy Makemie Statue in Accomac Makemie and his wife Naomi bought a plantation along Holdens Creek at Temperanceville, Virginia in Accomack County not far from the county seat. There he spent his final years and died in 1708. The community there he helped found still exists. Circa the 200th anniversary of the Presbyterian Church's founding, outsiders were appalled to find his gravesite on the former plantation in dilapidated condition. They stabilized it and erected a statue and memorial marker. Around that time, the surrounding community was experiencing economic prosperity, and renovated the church he had founded in Accomac, Virginia (named after the founder), as well as bought a disused Methodist church nearby in Onancock, Virginia and after demolishing it to erect a new structure named it after his supportive wife Naomi in 1903.http://www.nmpreschurch.org/historical_milestones.html Recently, development pressures in Temperanceville, Virginia led the statue and memorial marker to be moved to behind the Accomac church.

It is a variety of honeydew melon, globose to subglobose and typically has white skin with sweet, white or pale green, flesh. In photographs, the melons appear light yellow, orange or white, with a light green or apricot yellow flesh, which makes it similar in appearance to other types in the cultivar group of the muskmelon. It is also heavy due to the density of the fruit's inner flesh. Like other types of honeydews, the Bailan melon is rich in Vitamin C and protein. According to Chinese sources, the melons were introduced to China by Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the United States, who donated melon seeds to the locals while visiting in the 1940s. Wallace had a background in agriculture and had founded a major seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred. This is the reason the Chinese sometimes refer to the melon as the Hualaishi (an adaptation of the name \\"Wallace\\").

It is accessible be taken by a boat from Marina South Pier. Saint John's Island formerly housed a quarantine station for cholera cases detected among immigrants in the late 19th century, and starting from 1901, victims of beriberi were also brought to the island. By 1930, the island gained world recognition as a quarantine centre screening immigrants and pilgrims returning from Mecca. The quarantine station was eventually also used to house victims of other diseases, such as leprosy. When mass immigration was closed in mid-20th century, the island was used to house a penal settlement and from 1955 a drug rehabilitation centre. The 40.5-hectare hilly island was transformed in 1975 into a tranquil getaway with swimming lagoons, beaches, picnic grounds, trekking routes and football fields. The island is also a haven for a host of flora and fauna, and is popular for weekend visits. There is also a small jetty at the southern end of the island to transport visitors to and from the mainland. The island, reputedly haunted according to some local traditions, was the site of Sir Stamford Raffles's anchorage before meeting the Malay chief of Singapore in 1819. Also located on the island is the Tropical Marine Science Institute, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) of Singapore's Marine Aquaculture Centre. A detention centre for illegal immigrants still remains.

Its Cambridge Observatory building now houses offices and the department library. * The Solar Physics Observatory, which started in Cambridge in 1912. The building was partly demolished in 2008 to make way for the Kavli Institute for Cosmology. * The Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, which was created by Fred Hoyle in 1967. Its building is the main departmental site (the Hoyle Building), with a lecture theatre added in 1999, and a second two-storey wing built in 2002. From 1990 to 1998, the Royal Greenwich Observatory was based in Cambridge, where it occupied Greenwich House on a site adjacent to the Institute of Astronomy.  Teaching  The department teaches 3rd and 4th year undergraduates as part of the Natural Sciences Tripos or Mathematical Tripos. Around 30 students normally study the Masters which consists of a substantial research project (around 1/3 of the Masters) and students have an opportunity to study courses such as General Relativity, Cosmology, Black Holes, Extrasolar Planets, Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, Structure and Evolution of Stars & Formation of Galaxies.https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/undergrad/part_iii/lectures In addition, there are around 12 to 18 graduate PhD students at the department per year, mainly funded by the STFC.

Facilities Prominent features of the suburb also include Ferndale Reserve, a large sports ground; and the small Ferndale Shopping Centre. The Canning River Regional Park, located in Ferndale's north, is a popular route for cycling and walking as it is the parkland of the Canning River. There were two primary schools in the suburb for several decades: Ferndale Primary, located in west Ferndale; and Kinlock Primary in the east. However, Kinlock closed following the 2007 school year, along with Lynwood Primary in a neighbouring suburb. In 2008, students from those two schools moved to Ferndale Primary School. At the end of the 2009 school year, Ferndale Primary closed and was replaced by Bannister Creek Primary, which had been built on the former Lynwood Primary school site. Bannister derives its name from the creek that starts in Lynwood and passes through Ferndale, where it discharges into the Canning River.Department of Education and Training \\"School Information - New Schools\\" http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/schoolinfo/ESTAT/Latest/NewSchools.htm Accessed 2 January 2008. Each of the primary schools mentioned were and are feeder schools to Lynwood Senior High School, the main secondary school of the surrounding suburbs. There are cricket and football grounds along Metcalf Road. The cricket grounds are shared with facilities of a club nicknamed Faries. Similarly, the football grounds are shared with facilities of a club nicknamed Panthers. Transport Ferndale's main road, Metcalfe Road, links two routes - Nicholson Road, which links Ferndale to Cannington and Westfield Carousel; and High Road, linking to Riverton and the Bull Creek railway station. Ferndale is served by the Transperth bus service 508 linking the area to Bull Creek and to Cannington. It is operated by Swan Transit. Prior to the commencement of the Perth-Mandurah rail line, Transperth operated two routes through Ferndale (877 and 878), which had linked the suburb to Perth via Willetton and the Kwinana Freeway.

It is implemented as a Windows service called the Volume Shadow Copy service. A software VSS provider service is also included as part of Windows to be used by Windows applications. Shadow Copy technology requires either the Windows NTFS or ReFS filesystems in order to create and store shadow copies. Shadow Copies can be created on local and external (removable or network) volumes by any Windows component that uses this technology, such as when creating a scheduled Windows Backup or automatic System Restore point. Overview VSS operates at the block level of volumes. A snapshot is a read-only point-in- time copy of the volume. Snapshots allow the creation of consistent backups of a volume, ensuring that the contents do not change and are not locked while the backup is being made. The core component of shadow copy is the Volume Shadow Copy service, which initiates and oversees the snapshot creation process. The components that perform all the necessary data transfer are called providers. While Windows comes with a default System Provider, software and hardware vendors can create their own software or hardware providers and register them with Volume Shadow Copy service. Each provider has a maximum of 10 seconds' time to complete the snapshot generation. Other components that are involved in the snapshot creation process are writers. The aim of Shadow Copy is to create consistent reliable snapshots. But sometimes, this cannot simply be achieved by completing all pending file change operations. Sometimes, it is necessary to complete a series of inter-related changes to several related files. For example, when a database application transfers a piece of data from one file to another, it needs to delete it from the source file and create it in the destination file. Hence, a snapshot must not be between the first deletion and the subsequent creation, or else it is worthless; it must either be before the deletion or after the creation. Enforcing this semantic consistency is the duty of writers. Each writer is application-specific and has 60 seconds to establish a backup-safe state before providers start snapshot creation. If the Volume Shadow Copy service does not receive acknowledgement of success from the corresponding writers within this time-frame, it fails the operation. By default, snapshots are temporary; they do not survive a reboot. The ability to create persistent snapshots was added in Windows Server 2003 onward. However, Windows 8 removed the GUI portion necessary to browse them. () Windows software and services that support VSS include Windows Failover Cluster, Windows Server Backup, Hyper-V, Virtual Server, Active Directory, SQL Server, Exchange Server and SharePoint. The end result is similar to a versioning file system, allowing any file to be retrieved as it existed at the time any of the snapshots was made. Unlike a true versioning file system, however, users cannot trigger the creation of new versions of an individual file, only the entire volume. As a side-effect, whereas the owner of a file can create new versions in a versioning file system, only a system administrator or a backup operator can create new snapshots (or control when new snapshots are taken), because this requires control of the entire volume rather than an individual file. Also, many versioning file systems (such as the one in VMS) implicitly save a version of files each time they are changed; systems using a snapshotting approach like Windows only capture the state periodically. History=Windows XP and Server 2003 Volume Snapshot Service was first added to Microsoft Windows in Windows XP. It can only create temporary snapshots, used for accessing stable on-disk version of files that are opened for editing (and therefore locked). This version of VSS is used by NTBackup. The creation of persistent snapshots (which remain available across reboots until specifically deleted) has been added in Windows Server 2003, allowing up to 512 snapshots to exist simultaneously for the same volume. In Windows Server 2003, VSS is used to create incremental periodic snapshots of data of changed files over time. A maximum of 64 snapshots are stored on the server and are accessible to clients over the network. This feature is known as Shadow Copies for Shared Folders and is designed for a client‚Äìserver model. Its client component is included with Windows XP SP2 or later, and is available for installation on Windows 2000 SP3 or later, as well as Windows XP RTM or SP1. Windows XP and later include a command line utility called \`vssadmin\` that can list, create or delete volume shadow copies and list installed shadow copy writers and providers. Windows Vista, 7 and Server 2008  Microsoft updated a number of Windows components to make use of Shadow Copy. Backup and Restore in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 use shadow copies of files in both file-based and sector-by-sector backup. The System Protection component uses VSS when creating and maintaining periodic copies of system and user data on the same local volume (similar to the Shadow Copies for Shared Folders feature in Windows Server); VSS allows such data to be locally accessed by System Restore. System Restore allows reverting to an entire previous set of shadow copies called a restore point. Compare: Compare: Prior to Windows Vista, System Restore depended on a file-based filter that watched changes for a certain set of file extensions, and then copied files before they were overwritten. In addition, a part of Windows Explorer called Previous Versions allows restoring individual files or folders locally from restore points as they existed at the time of the snapshot, thus retrieving an earlier version of a file or recovering a file deleted by mistake. Finally, Windows Server 2008 introduces the \`diskshadow\` utility which exposes VSS functionality through 20 different commands. The system creates shadow copies automatically once per day, or when triggered by the backup utility or installer applications which create a restore point. The \\"Previous Versions\\" feature is available in the Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and in all Windows 7 editions. The Home Editions of Vista lack the \\"Previous Versions\\" feature, even though the Volume Snapshot Service is included and running. Using third-party tools it is still possible to restore previous versions of files on the local volume. ShadowExplorer allows restoring lost or altered files Some of these tools also allow users to schedule snapshots at user-defined intervals, configure the storage used by volume-shadow copies and compare files or directories from different points-in-time using snapshots. TimeTraveler adds a timeline to Windows Explorer allowing the user to open, restore or compare files or directories from points-in-time Windows 7 also adds native support through a GUI to configure the storage used by volume-shadow copies. Windows 8 and Server 2012 While supporting persistent shadow copies, Windows 8 lacks the GUI portion necessary to browse them; therefore the ability to browse, search or recover older versions of files via the Previous Versions tab of the Properties dialog of files was removed for local volumes. However, using third party tools (such as ShadowExplorer) it is possible to recover that functionality. The feature is fully available in Windows Server 2012. Windows 10 Windows 10 restored the Previous Versions tab that was removed in Windows 8; however, in earlier builds it depended upon the File History feature instead of Volume Shadow copy. Current builds now allow restoration from both File History and System Protection (System Restore) points, which use Volume Shadow Copy. Samba Server Samba on Linux is capable of providing Shadow Copy Service on an LVM-backed storage or with an underlying ZFS or btrfs. Compatibility While the different NTFS versions have a certain degree of both forward and backward compatibility, there are certain issues when mounting newer NTFS volumes containing persistent shadow copies in older versions of Windows. This affects dual-booting, and external portable hard drives. Specifically, the persistent shadow copies created by Windows Vista on an NTFS volume are deleted when Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 mount that NTFS volume. This happens because the older operating system does not understand the newer format of persistent shadow copies. Likewise, System Restore snapshots created by Windows 8 are deleted if they are exposed to a previous version of Windows.
